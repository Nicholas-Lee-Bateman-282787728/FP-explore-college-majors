4295721,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Most likely this movie will work for true fans of film from the 1950's and 1960's.  The Tourist harkens back to a time when stories were presented as a sophisticated genre.  What?  No instant answers?  No blood and flames and explosions?  You have to be engaged with not only the senses but also the brain to fully enjoy this hat tip to an earlier era of film-making.

To set some information straight about the characters, Jolie's character is named Elise - not Elsie.  Depp plays his role of bumbling traveler to a T and Rufus Sewell adds a thread of mystery that has you guessing.

If you haven't watched many foreign or Hitchcock suspense films set in the jet-set locals of Europe or been enamored by the slow pace of The Day of the Jackal, then you may find this film out of synch with your typical expectations.  This film is rich with scenery, fashion, wealth, and low key twisty intrigue.  What it lacks compared to today's heavy handedness of a Borne Identity type film is exactly what makes this refreshing.  The cinematography is stellar.

The best:  Lush backgrounds and lean, well dressed characters with a higher level of vocabulary than the typical language du jour of most recent films.  The worst:  Probably too slow paced for the run of the mill viewer.  The in-between:  Drop the expectations of a Hollywood cookie cutter film adrenaline high and be entertained by the locale, the language, and the intrigue.

This is worth seeing if you are a serious film buff.",1292371200,302,1481,4.674418604651163

4295723,3,B004A8ZWT2,"In ""The Tourist,"" director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck does his best to recreate the great suspense films of the late 50s.  Think Technicolor Hitchcock starring Cary Grant in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-By-Northwest/dp/B0045HCJ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North By Northwest</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Catch-a-Thief/dp/B00005JJX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Catch a Thief</a>"" where the locale becomes a character and the plot relies on the whimsy and romantic persona of the lead male actor and his seemingly magnetic talent to attract primo women.  Perhaps, von Donnersmarck feels that Johnny Depp with his quirky ability to masquerade as a multitude of oddball personalities (Captain Jack Sparrow of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Collection/dp/B001BYMX4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean Collection</a>&nbsp;franchise, Dean Corso in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ninth-Gate/dp/B000NQRR1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ninth Gate</a>&nbsp;and more recently The Mad Hatter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>) can emulate the insouciance and nerdy nonchalance of Roger Thornhill and John Robie, both Cary Grant creations.  If, additionally and in the same sense, Angelina Jolie can totter in the 4 inch heels of the mysterious fashionistas Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint with their knowing ability to manipulate their men and conquer their worlds effortlessly, the film would come together as both a homage and modern take on the classic thriller where through the error of mistaken identity, an average innocent person is hurtled into a life threatening situation that inevitably rocks his world romantically for the better.

""The Tourist"" has all the right ingredients, but manages to fall short with perhaps too much editing and not enough background story.  The chemistry between the leads is meant to sizzle and relay to the audience just why one does anything for love.  However, some of the motivating factors are never spelled out or revealed with any anticipation or impact.  Sadly, the result seems a waste of talent and a film that doesn't intelligently scintillate as its advertising promises.

In this case, Depp plays the innocent being led into the slaughter by femme fatale Jolie.  As with the Hitchcockian leads, their universe of espionage sparkles with the beauty of exotic locale--""Tourist"" amply utilizes the Renaissance splendor of the Doge's Venice, scenes of luxurious hotels, glittering ballrooms and enchanted waterways as well as the elegant bustle of Paris where old world meets new at the immense Gare de Lyon for another classic innuendo-filled interlude on the TGV.  Grant and Kelly in a coupe on Monaco's famous hairpin turns are swapped for Depp and Jolie en water taxis traversing the canals of La Serenissima.  They all clean up nicely, donning tuxedos and gowns for the obligatory ballroom scene where the innocent has his ""ah-ha"" moment and accepts his new heroic role, cleverly driving the plot to its climatic scene and satisfying aftermath.

Perhaps, director von Donnersmarck, feels that like the audiences of the 50s and early 60s, audiences today, tired of the austerity ensuing from financial insecurity, wish to return to an escapist genre of beautiful films featuring extravagantly dressed women and men with money to burn and an almost derogative nonchalance regarding its worth.  If this is so, to pull it all off more tightly, where the glitz of his locale and his two stars accent the story to perfection, he has a few things to reconsider.

His leads must balance their elegance with a humanness that the audience feels and applauds.  Jolie is beautiful--her slim body draped in spectacular clothes that cause men and women both to stare unabashedly as she passes by like a reigning queen may seem a little overdone, but not completely unreasonable.  She is, after all, Angelina Jolie--so, why wouldn't we look?  As Elise, she doesn't speak much--just looks confidant, slinking through Paris and Venice, knowing full well wherever she goes she will be well received.  And, why not?  Nonetheless, despite this obvious perfection, when she taunts Depp with luminous eyes that suggest her struggle between the allegiance of career and the overwhelming tour de force that is love, she seems overly controlled--more a study of a woman in love rather than the actual being.  Jolie's performance aptly illustrates the difficulty to convey the rush associated with love and the ability to remain coolly elegant.

Depp can be mischievously attractive--but Cary Grant he is not.  Jack Sparrow, yes.  But, he has his moments where the audience laughs out loud.  His jaunt across the Venice rooftops (again in homage to ""To Catch a Thief"") emulates Jack Sparrow slowly and comically sinking in his dinghy when we first lay eyes on him in the first of the Pirates of the Caribbean films.  However, in ""Tourist"" this farce of Depp in his PJs running for his life confuses rather than amuses.  Nonetheless, Depp as the archetypical Scamp charms us effortlessly; it is always a pleasure watching a good-looking man with a self-deprecating attitude win while in a situation with the odds stacked against him.  Depp doesn't have his usual crazy range to fall back on; he seems to be holding back--trying for restraint to not give too much away and unfortunately loosing too much of the whacky persona the audience wishes most to see.

The secondary characters work better.  Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton are both delicious as Scotland yard personnel. They blunder well while impeccably dressed, but other than the fact that as police on a case, the audience is not privy to the almost manic drive of Bettany to get his man.  The relationship between Bettany and his superior Dalton calls to mind Clousseau and Chief Inspector Dreyfus--even though ""Tourist"" thinks of itself as a different type of film when compared to Blake Edward's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pink-Panther-Film-Collection-The-Pink-Panther-A-Shot-in-the-Dark-Strikes-Again-Revenge-of-Trail-of/dp/B0001AG01M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pink Panther Film Collection (The Pink Panther / A Shot in the Dark / Strikes Again / Revenge of / Trail of)</a>&nbsp;series.

But perhaps that is where Tourist fails.  Maybe it should be whackier.  Maybe Depp should have been allowed to channel a different type of innocent--one with Jack Sparrow's ruthless sense of humor and unconventional mores.  The hybrid nature of ""Tourist"" bewilders the audience into thinking something more is on its way that never quite arrives once the plot settles into the familiar ground that Hitchcock does way better.

From the Hitchcockian standpoint, the storyline of ""Tourist"" may be a little weak with not enough moments between Jolie and Depp to make their more profound attraction more believable.  Think Eva Marie Saint, Cary Grant and that tunnel in North by Northwest. Whoa what a ride! Eva is on a mission, but she cannot help but be charmed.  In her attempt to be `the mystery woman,' Jolie seems to struggle a bit--trying too hard to be imperturbable, the audience does not always see her vulnerability and it wants to feel the chemistry. In this regard, the interlude on the train should have been more provocative, perhaps with some flashbacks to the Jolie character's affair with the infamous Alexander Pierce to show her confusion over her attraction to Depp and the allegiance she still feels for her lover.

The city of Venice anoints the film with the benediction of its scintillating beauty and director of photographer, John Seale, can hardly ask for a better backdrop or assignment.  However, the city itself has mysteries of its own that could have been integrated into the story to make going to Venice less of a advertised travelogue and more the final destination culminating not only the Scotland Yard investigation, but the affair of the heart.  Somehow with more thought to the film's genre identity, as well as to the various factions of the story, the whole film would have benefited as a more adroitly crafted  entertainment.

Bottom line?  ""The Tourist"" attempts to recreate the mood of the late 50s Hitchcockian thriller/romance with two attractive leads whose chemistry drives the action.  At the same time, some whacky moments intervene that suggest a tug towards the crazy comedy of the Pink Panther series.  Because this film does not know which genre it is trying to emulate, it fails on both levels.  Depp and Jolie try to pull it off by being beautiful people in the wondrous setting of Venice.  However, every once and a while, this reviewer wanted to see Depp in a madman's disguise--with that incredible braid in his beard and that twinkle in his eye.  Along those same lines, Beauty, as personified by Jolie, requires some chink in the amour of perfection--less polished tones and more passionate screaming.  Recommended nevertheless for its abundant display of the glories of Venice.

4295724,3,B004A8ZWT2,"Angelina Jolie's appearance in ""The Tourist"" may someday set records for sheer photogenic appeal. She plays one of the most glamorous undercover agents ever to grace the silver screen; her wardrobe, her makeup, and her hair are all immaculate, and for some strange reason, they stay that way all 103 minutes of the film. Even when her character is roughed up by an odious mobster near the end, she still looks as if she has been prepped for a ""Vanity Fair"" photo shoot. This is, of course, a testament to her beauty as well as to the capable hands of her makeup artists, her hairdressers, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. Credit also to co-writer/director Florian Henkel von Donnersmarck for letting the camera linger on her face and figure a little longer than necessary. He clearly knew what the people wanted to see.

But where does that leave the film itself? Is it supposed to be less about plot and more about serving as an extended fashion show? This is one of the few action thrillers that doesn't get away with being preposterous, for it doesn't have the conviction to go all out with it. Unlike Jolie's previous action film, ""Salt,"" ""The Tourist"" is timid and flimsy. The stunts are never daring enough, the romance isn't passionate enough, and the sense of humor is so reserved that it seems completely out of place. The story is exceedingly simple, pretty much to the point that it barely holds our interest. Worst of all is the lack of onscreen chemistry between Jolie and costar Johnny Depp. The only real credit I can give it is for its beautiful cinematography and breathtaking scenery, the canals and Byzantine architecture of Venice shot with the same care and precision of an Italian tourism commercial.

In the film, Jolie plays Elsie Clifton-Ward, a British beauty who cunningly misleads a federal investigation of her former lover, the unseen Alexander Pearce, a career criminal wanted in many countries by many people. This includes the heatless gangster Reginald Shaw (Steve Berkoff), who he embezzled billions from. Scotland Yard's Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) has been keeping tabs on Elsie for two years in the desperate hope that she will lead them to Pearce; for reasons never adequately explained, he's driven to capture the elusive criminal and bring him to justice. Pearce stays in touch with Elsie through a series of handwritten notes, which are delivered in plain but neat white envelopes. Her latest instructions: Board a train from Paris to Venice, and along the way, throw off the authorities by seeking out and befriending a man with Pearce's height and build.

Here enters Frank Tupelo (Depp), a nervous math teacher from Wisconsin hoping to forget a personal tragedy. He reads a spy novel. He puffs away on an electronic cigarette. He fumbles for his words like a man on his first blind date. Elsie regards Frank calmly, all the while calculating every move. They arrive in Venice. She convinces him to accompany her to a hotel and stay in her luxury suite - and, of course, he'll have to sleep on the sofa. In the aftermath of an intimate dinner and a few drinks, they kiss on the balcony. The next morning, while Elsie is out, a group of strange men barge into the suite intent on killing Frank, believing he's Pearce. And so begins the thriller portion of the film, highlighted by awkward action sequences, a contrived romance, and curious sudden appearances by Rufus Sewell. I leave it to you to discover whether or not his character is red herring.

""The Tourist,"" a remake of the French film ""Anthony Zimmer,"" has all the reliable crime thriller clichs, including exotic locations, mobsters, a train ride, a mystery woman, and an apparent case of mistaken identity. It even has Timothy Dalton, although his role doesn't require him to be James Bond once again; he plays Chief Inspector Jones, who finds Acheson incredibly irritating and seems to take great pleasure in telling him off at the end. But even with all this at hand, something is missing. For something meant to be thrilling, we never quite go beyond the image of Johnny Depp running barefoot across loosely tiled Venetian rooftops. The blood never really pumps. The adrenaline never really rushes. It's all so flat and tired and insipid - not at all what I expected from a movie like this.

There is, of course, an inevitable plot twist, one that surprised me by not being surprising. Perhaps that was shortsighted on my part. Considering everything that happens, considering what was said, considering what we're shown, could the film have ended any other way? Crime thrillers are constructed with the intention of misdirecting the audience before revealing the truth. What bothers me is that this movie makes no real effort to trick us; it leads to a conclusion that was obvious from the very start. With no good romantic subplot, with no decent action sequences, and with no engaging plot, what else is there? The more I think about ""The Tourist,"" the more I return to its star, Angelina Jolie, whose beauty thoroughly overshadows everything else. That's not much of a compliment for the film itself, but it's the best I can do.",1292112000,14,5154,4.8522727272727275
4295725,2,B004A8ZWT2,"By now nearly everyone has at least heard of The Tourist, the thriller that unites huge stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. It's one of the movies that's probably on everyone's must-see list based on star power alone. The problem is that The Tourist lacks anything that would make it a memorable or worthwhile experience, which is disappointing considering who's involved.

Federal agents have been following Elise (Jolie) for months as they wait for anything out of the routine to occur. The feds are after a man named Alexander Pierce, a man who Elise is known to be close with, that owes $744 million to the government. One day while tracking Elise, the unthinkable happens; something out of the ordinary finally occurs. What starts with a letter being delivered by a bike courier turns into a wild goose chase onto a train on its way to Venice. It's there that Elise chooses to sit next to a man named Frank (Depp), a math teacher who just so happens to be a tourist in Italy. As things progress, Elise constantly intervenes in Frank's plans and eventually draws him into her world where the federal agents begin to believe that Frank is Alexander Pierce since they have somehow never been able to get a clear look at his face. Frank is brought into the world of trickery and espionage, something that he's only read about in the spy novels he's so frequently caught reading. What began as nothing more than a stranger being picked out in a crowd slowly begins to culminate into a full fledged relationship that neither Frank or Elise can walk away from.

When it comes to Angelina Jolie, her role is a bit different than some of her other recent roles. She seems to always play that strong female role that is either more than capable of taking care of herself or is just as strong as some of the bigger men in whatever project she's a part of. While that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it gets a little tiresome and you crave to see an actor do something outside of their range. While Elise is said to be able to take care of herself in The Tourist, we really never see any proof of that. She takes a life preserver and smashes it into a guy's face who's hanging off of a boat she's driving at one point, but that's it. The rest of the time she's walking around in elegant gowns and trying to look as feminine as possible. That and not display any sort of emotion whatsoever. This isn't what I had in mind when I wanted to see Angelina Jolie do something different.

Johnny Depp doesn't have much room to talk either. While he's more than qualified to show emotional range or be incredibly eccentric at times, he seems to do nothing more than act like a watered down version of Jack Sparrow while doing the most idiotic and spontaneous things to put him in danger for a woman he's just met yet has become incredibly infatuated with. He does have a few one-liners that may get a chuckle or two, but they're delivered in such a flat tone that they'll probably be forgotten about once you leave the theater.

The biggest joke about the film is the ending. It is literally so cliche and so atrocious that it makes the entire film a complete waste of time. Once it's revealed who Alexander Pierce is, you're left wondering if this entire string of events was really necessary. Imagine taking the longest and most dangerous route to doing something simple like making toast and that's pretty much how The Tourist goes about doing things. I could just walk to the refrigerator and get jelly or butter or to the pantry for peanut butter, but instead I'm going to lock my desired condiment in a safe, lead someone on a wild scavenger hunt all over the city that'll put them in harm's way, and make the government think that they owe them a massive amount of money so they run into problems with the law at every turn. That'll be fun, right? It'll make that toast taste so much better in the end, but the bread turns out to be stale and you just gag whenever you try to eat it since you've grown sick of having to swallow it so often.

The Tourist is a stale thriller with flat performances from actors you'd expect a lot more from, but is still somewhat decent despite its flaws. I'm probably giving the film more credit than it deserves since I'm a fairly big fan of Johnny Depp and he was mildly enjoyable in small doses in this, but the film's ending pretty much destroys anything you may enjoy early on. It's just a shame since it had such potential to be a fun and entertaining thriller, but will probably still be mistaken for one because of the stellar cast alone.",1292025600,11,4570,4.474820143884892

Cons: slow start; may need two viewings to fully appreciate; Johnny Depp mumbles like Harrison Ford

Frank: ""Not when you downgrade it from murder, but when you upgrade it from room-service it's quite serious""

the plot

The mysterious Alexander Pearce is a notorious British thief who is wanted by both the French and English authorities as well as the Shaw Mafia, an outfit he himself used to run with. Since not many even know what Pearce looks like, the French police along with Scotland Yard are tailing his girlfriend Elise Clifton-Ward, thinking that she will eventually lead them to him. The Shaw mafia has the same idea since they are unable to find Pearce as well.

One morning as Elise is having her breakfast at an outdoor bistro, she receives an envelope with a note inside from Pearce. It instructs her to find a decoy for himself so that those who after him would follow this distraction instead of discovering his true whereabouts. She then burns the letter, but the authorities were able to decipher the note with some sophisticated equipment and learn of this plot.

As the beautiful Elise makes her way to Venice, she spots an American tourist named Frank Tupelo and decides that he should be the patsy. Many chases involving both gangsters and police ensue leaving Frank confused and scared. Whenever Frank would get into major trouble, Elise would use her skillful maneuvers to rescue him before it's too late. Meanwhile Frank along this short way has discovered that he loves Elise only to deliberately put himself in danger to make sure she remains safe and alive.

the breakdown

I must be changing in my old age, as I once again liked a movie that I really didn't want to waste my time watching in the first place. To make matters more uniform, it is once again an Angelina Jolie project that makes a believer out of me, (one of the others being Salt). Both of these films were Angelina's film output for 2010, and they both have that running theme that Jolie is really some undercover super spy. It may seem silly, but I think it works for me. Angelina didn't really perform too many physical acrobats here like she had in Salt, actually if you compare the two, The Tourist comes off more like a romantic comedy more than a thriller, although that component is very present.

The comedic parts were mainly Johnny Depp lines. His character Frank, a school math teacher from Wisconsin, was very soft spoken and reserved. He must have had a lot of fun playing one of these clueless American tourist characters, as it fits well into his theory of how America is akin to stupid puppies or whatever stupid thing he said about us. Well, aside from Depp's insipid and misguided opinions, he was funny. His biggest laughs came from his attempt to better communicate with the Italian people by using the limited Spanish he knows, believing that he's speaking their language. The very evil Steven Berkoff plays the villainous Shaw effectively. Berkoff has an uncanny yet natural scary-type of evil criminalness about him that always gives his characters some weighty legitimacy. Ever since Beverly Hills Cop and the even more so Under a Cherry Moon, I've been truly afraid of his characters.

I liked The Tourist, despite that I planned on hating it, or even better ignoring it all together. I'm glad that my sneaky wife had moved this to the top of my Netflix queue. Oh it's for my own good I suppose. The Tourist will either keep you guessing the whole time, or you're going to be like me and think you have it figured out only to be proven wrong in the end. The film is rated PG-13 because Johnny Depp had to drop the f-bomb, which in my opinion didn't even make sense here. There was some violence, but nothing bloody or at all graphic. You should watch this with the family, as long as you turn up the volume so you can hear Johnny Depp's mumble-style of speech, and distract the younger ones when the f-bomb is dropped.

4295996,1,B004A8ZWT2,"More thumbs down than I have for this one.  The mistakes, which seem so cliched, cynical Hollywood formula, will make your teeth hurt.  I love Johnny Depp, but this movie is terribly mis-cast.  All that would've been required to rescue this bomb would've been switching Depp's and Sewell's roles.  Consider Depp's work:  He requires parts that allow him to be outrageous, making him a poor choice for leading man.  He's wonderful, but he isn't subtle. Sewell, on the other hand, is capable of a wider range of totally believable, nuanced characterization, and could've given Frank such depth, glamour and humor.  And total believablity.  Besides, to paraphrase from the final scene, if you were going to spend millions for a new face, which one would you chose?

As for Jolie, in a part that recalls Audrey Hepburn in Charade or Grace Kelly in Rear Window, she is painfully campy and even ugly, bringing none of the Hepburn/Kelly easy charm that her role needed so badly.  I knew she was in trouble when she ate her morning croissant in gloves.  Really.

All supporting roles were played well, but need only have been phoned in, the casting was so predictable and safe, according to body type, and as Sewell has pointed out many times, facial bone structure.  The Russians looked Russian (variations of Khrushchev/Putin!), the British were Britsh (variations on James Bond -Timothy Dalton, and DS James Hathaway -Laurence Fox), the French were French and the Italians were beautifully Italian.

Venice was not given enough screen time.",1489449600,,1535,4.9921259842519685

4296231,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's, The Tourist, is beautifully filmed and harkens back to the big productions of the golden era of Hollywood.  Johnny Depp's performance was sweetly charismatic in this remake, and Angelina Jolie is simply stunning as the glamorous female lead. Their onscreen chemistry was engaging and the entire cast showcased their talents in every scene.

My only real criticisms were perhaps how quickly Jolie's character, Elise, developed such a deep emotional attachment to Depp's character, Frank, when she was supposedly in love with Alexander, or the credibility of the cursory back story of Jolie's character.  Perhaps a few more scenes with Depp and Jolie may have solidified the emotional involvement between the two main characters, but both actors portrayed their characters well within the film. The talents of Paul Bettany, Steven Berkoff, Timothy Dalton, Raoul Bova, and Rufus Sewell also bear mentioning.  Their performances were equally entertaining as well, in both the dramatic and subtle comedic moments throughout the film.

A special mention to James Newton Howard and Gabriel Yared for the music.  Newton's music score truly captured the beauty and action throughout the film, and Yared's ""Dance in F""  was exquisitely moving in its grace.  The film's soundtrack often was hauntingly beautiful and easily reflected a romantic intimacy that other movie scores simply lack.

The Tourist leads the audience into a world of intrigue, beauty, and glamorous elegance with beautiful locations and equally beautiful ""movie stars"" that many overlooked in favor of more mainstream films, which was unfortunate for this cinematic, charming escape.

I can understand the comparison, but Grace Kelly was classy, graceful, oh so cool. Jolie is not. Grace Kelly was also naturally beautiful. In The Tourist Jolie looked almost anorexia skinny and looked out of place in the gowns she had to wear in the movie. Because of her skin-and-bone look, for me, there was no sex appeal. Both Gary Grant and Grace Kelly always seemed comfortable working together and they just flowed into their parts.

4296348,5,B004A8ZWT2,"Disc was in great shape.  I like comedy genre best.  I had no idea what this was going to be.  This has virtually no bad language.  If you like British kooky humor you'll like this, (e.g. A Fish Called Wanda).  Depp exaggerates his body gestures throughout movie making the character VERY FUNNY.  Remember how he did the same thing in Pirates of the Caribbean?.  If you are a Hollywood snob and expect an academy award winning film, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.  Kinda on the order of slap stick with lots of innuendos.  I've seen it 5 times.  EVERY ACTOR IS IN SYNC WITH THE OTHERS.  ALL PLAY WELL TOGETHER.  VERY  GOOD CASTING TO WORK OFF EACH OTHER....CHEMISTRY.  Pop some pop corn, sit back for a mindless funny evening.  Kids would not be interested, too much dialog.",1464134400,4,764,4.474452554744525

4296351,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Liking these two actors will really help your enjoyment of this movie - in an old classic James Bond kind-a of way (without all the gadgets) and Angelina Jolie as the surveilled girlfriend of the hunted agent/thief who stole billions; it has just enough twists to keep you interested. Depp ( the unsuspecting tourist) and Jolie, to me, were just not given the greatest of scripts. You can tell as soon as the move starts it has great potential - and you keep waiting for someone to ""turn up the heat"" so a rapid boil can get going, but they don't. However, the steady simmer is pretty good and worth your time. I'm left with a, ya, ok that was cool feeling, but boy am I glad it was only $3.99 (or less), if I had paid 6.99 or full Theater price + popcorn - like $16 or $18.00 I would have been disappointed.",1463875200,,808,4.253246753246753

4297090,5,B004A8ZWT2,"The filmmakers state (repeatedly) in the explanation of why they made the movie that they wanted to revive the elegant movies of the past.  They certainly did that.  This is a lot of fun and I've loved it both times I've watched.

Elise (Jolie) and Frank (Depp) meet on a train and she strikes up a relationship with this guy who is ""only a math teacher"" from Wisconsin.  She is elegant, refined, in control and he's happy to be with her.  They play those roles very well and that makes this story work and made it all the more worthwhile for me.

It is elegant, the scenery as much as the stars -- the acting is perfect for making this a mystery ride -- twists and turns in the plot all along the way.  It is a thriller, not realistic, just fun.  Latch on and enjoy the ride.  And I loved the ending both times.",1428883200,,812,4.187096774193549

4297164,2,B004A8ZWT2,"The Tourist
This Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie disappointment is billed as a crime-action-mystery.  The most important mystery about the movie is what happened to the $100 million that the defrauded producers spent to make the thing.  It has brought in only $53 million world-wide to date and will be a financial disaster for the backers.  Jolie and Depp, stars of such stature that they are impervious to failure, will no doubt be just fine.
 The film has as inspiration the taught, complicated thrillers made so well by Alferd Hitchcock a half century ago and successfully imitated many times since.  Depp plays Frank, an American tourist in wicked Europe.  He becomes involved with mystery woman Jolie on a train and the plot twists and turns at the speed of a slow saunter.  The script, weak though it is, (and co-written by German director Von Donnersmark) is not the main problem.  We expect a degree of incoherency in an action flick, what we have to have is action.
 Depp is wonderful, as usual, in this role as an American naf caught up in events beyond his ken.  The supporting cast includes Paul Bethany, a terrific actor we remember with joy from Master and Commander, A Knights Tale and many other roles.  Even Timothy Dalton makes a small appearance.
  The problem is Angelia Jolie.  She is an actress that we appreciate most when she lets her freak flag fly.  In this one, she barely changes her expression.  I think that she is so monumentally photogenic that the director just did not know what to do with her.  She is paraded through the entire film from one set piece to another of her showing off expensive, tasteful designer couture, and to excellent advantage at that.  She is not so much acting as allowing herself to be exhibited.  Sometimes we ask beautiful, stoic models to appear in films after being taught to act.  Here it seems that an actress has been taught to be beautiful and stoic and to not act.  It is a bad bargain.
 Director Von Donnersmark has received an Oscar for best foreign film.  It seems that American style action films are not his forte.  It is only fair to note that the film has been nominated for three Golden Globe awards, which is not small change.  It is not explained however why the nominations are in the comedy category.  Is this some snarky, high brow sarcasm?
 This ruined action flick rates a dismal one and half saw blades.  It is rated PG-13 but should properly have a label telling the ticket buying public to avoid at all costs.",1428451200,,2491,4.651376146788991

4297898,4,B004A8ZWT2,"The clever, entertaining film reminded me of the great films of the 1960s and Angelina Jolie has all the lush beauty of Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner.  Jonny Depp on the other hand remains the anti-hero, a bit ruffled and untidy, a bit sarcastic and yet innocent. The film could best be described with the word clever since it has an engaging and humorous script with many twists and turns that keeps the viewers attention trying to put the pieces together.

The film is a great puzzle that gradually unfolds and in this film it is very difficult for the viewer to get ahead of the story.  That certainly is nice for a change. The film uses an old Hitchcock technique where the female lead knows more than she tells and the male lead is somewhat of a bumbler with whom the audience can identify. But nothing is as it seems in this film.

The films setting in Venice was a master-stroke since this beautiful and exotic city matches the romance and mystery of this film. Outstanding actors played supporting roles including Rufus Sewell, Timothy Dalton, and Paul Bettany. The director also does not have a second ravishing beauty to counter weigh Angelina Jolie. Instead, the film is full of strikingly handsome men in the roles of Parisian and Italian police officers, which allows Jolie multiple opportunities to interact with these handsome men who she continually confounds.

Special effects are kept to a minimum, which only makes sense when filming in the most beautiful city in the world.  This film uses Venice to maximum benefit as Franco Zeffirelli did for Florence Italy in Tea with Mussolini.

The cinematography is exceptional. I was amazed at how perfectly the exterior photography of Depp and Jolie was while maintaining the angelic blues of the Adriatic behind them. I enjoyed the film and felt I was fully entertained throughout the entire film, never a dull spot.",1406937600,,1879,4.816770186335404

4298062,1,B004A8ZWT2,"I am confused: Angelina Jolie has all the charm and presence of sock puppet, with the most extraordinary lava-red lipstick that makes her look like a street-fair clown. Her role in the story is to portray the irresistible femme fatale, but the lipstick, over-heavy eyeshadow and her anorexic appearance worked reminded me of one those medieval momento mori skeletons, except those skeletons show more range of expression than Jolie's lethargic persona.

Johnny Depp is mis-used, underused in this film. I felt he wanted to give much more to the part (and one can tell he has comedic talents as well), but apparently the screenplay and probably the director gave him the role of a dedicated milquetoast. Milquetoast, skeleton, and a conventional plot from the 1950s make for a movie that advances itself as fast as scum on a backwater Venice canal.

After I found myself looking at trailers in other tabs of my browsers while listening to this movie, I decided, 50 minutes in, to quit.

The second time I saw it a year later, I enjoyed it again although I remembered nearly everything about the plot.

Suffice to say Johnny Depp's character -- Frank Tupelo -- gets caught up in a risky plot when he becomes the chosen decoy of Angelina Jolie's character.  Any one of us might've walked away, but not Frank.  Frank had the misfortune of becoming enchanted by her, and he fell in love.

To be perfectly honest, some parts seemed a little unrealistic.  But y'know... it's just a story.  They have the liberty of doing that, and they pulled it off well.  Give it a watch.  I doubt you'll feel disappointed.",1403827200,,787,4.395833333333333

( eventhough, I know some who do )  All cat and mouse chase mounted to nothing.  Excited the audience for a few seconds then it achieved nothing.  Slow, fast, then slow fast film tempo, cliche' !
I only wasted 2.5 hrs watching this for the sake of seeing the pretty Angelina Jole and Venice ( in itself a character of the movie ) Johnny Depp's character is poorly written.

4298116,1,B004A8ZWT2,"I have been a big fan of both Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.  And i was blown away by the remarkable first film of Florian von Donnersmark, ""The Lives of Others.""  So....I expected something wonderful here.  What a disappointment.  Mr. von Donnesrsmark has apparently tired to recreate the wonderful romantic capers of the 50's, featuring beautiful people in fabulous  European locales, The most notable was ""To Catchh a Thief"" starring Grace Kelly and Cary Grant and there were others, too starring the likes of Audery Hepburn, Gregory Peck.  I can see how the young German Mr von Donnersmark who missed these films the first time around would be fascinated by them and would try to make one himself.  Too bad...he just doesn't doesn't have the touch for this genre..

The result is a terribly bland, boring, big waste of talent and good scenery.  The stars, both remarkable, don't even look good here.  Jolie looks plastic and bored.  She is playing a type, not a real person.  She doesn't seem to care and we don't either.  She isn't even sexy...too thin and too much makeup.  I think this is the first film I've seen her in where she failed to engage my interest.  Depp is just a mess.  To begin with...his hair!  He is supposed to be a math teacher from Wisconsin, but...please....don't insult those fine people.  The fact that that they are supposed to have a mutual attraction is beyond credible.

I kept thinking that I had seen this film before, and not just back in the 50's and then I realized that there is a fine French film, ""Anthony Zimmer"" by Jerome Salle upon which this film was based..  It succeeds wonderfully where this fails miserably.

I watched about half and that was more than enough.  I recommend everyone to watch ""Anthony Zimmer"" and see what this film could have been and wasn't.",1400371200,2,1810,4.697452229299363

4298118,3,B004A8ZWT2,"""The Tourist"" has a few things going for it.  Breathtaking Venice locales.  Equally ravishing is Angelina Jolie who glamorously blends in with the landscape.  A memorably menacing turn by Steven Berkoff who famously appeared in Stanley Kubrick films.  The film's undoing is a seemingly disengaged Johnny Depp in the title role and a script that is both trite and predictable.  Depp just seems bored and  perturbed that he has to punch the clock while on vacation.  Oddly enough the script co-written by Christopher McQuarrie who won an Oscar for the ingenious ""The Usual Suspects"" telegraphs its twists a mile away.  Apparently this is a homage to Hitchcock a la ""To Catch a Thief"" but the end result only underscores how derivative an exercise this is.  If you're going into this with less than heightened expectations then you will derive some enjoyment from the film.  My wife loved it out of undying devotion to Depp.  The DVD case heralds that this lightweight affair was nominated for three Golden Globes including best picture and nods for Jolie and Depp.  This leads to the age old question as to whether the Globe voters are susceptible to undue influence.",1399766400,,1165,4.917948717948718

4298245,4,B004A8ZWT2,"""The Tourist"" is very similar to some of the Hollywood escapist fair of the 1950's and early 1960's with the likes of Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly. In several films during this era, Grant played an American in European exotic locales dealing with espionage in relatively light-hearted plots. The classic films of this ilk which come to mind are ""To Catch a Thief"", ""Charade"", even ""Roman Holiday"", taking place in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Paris, and Rome. In ""The Tourist"", Depp plays a Cary Grant-like character and Angelina Jolie has the long dark hair of Audrey Hepburn with the demureness of Grace Kelly. The action begins in Paris then moves to Venice.

The best thing about the film in some ways is the opening. The viewer is plopped right into the middle of things without any background or knowledge. A demure mystery woman (Jolie) arrives at a caf in Paris near the Champs-Elysees and orders something, which we learn is already being prepared. She's a regular. A mysterious note is given to her and provides detailed instructions concerning exact steps she's supposed to take right after leaving the caf. While she is reading the note, we learn she is being staked out by some kind of government officials. Part of the instruction says ""...pick someone with my height and build and make them believe it is me..."" She burns the note and makes her way to the central train terminal in Paris.

Part of the fun of the story is that we don't know who wrote the note, and part of the mystery-fantasy is a gradual revelation regarding who the unknown letter-writer is. (The voice-over for the note is Jolie, which is somewhat confusing at first.) On a train to Venice, she meets a clueless American tourist from Wisconsin, Frank, played by Johnny Depp. Depp (who doesn't exactly seem like a clueless tourist from Wisconsin) acts flattered that a woman who just walked out of Vogue Magazine would sit by him on the train. And so begins a rather fun, if somewhat improbable, misadventure. Depp appears to be someone ""with my height and build"". Two factions are on the trail on the unknown ""letter-writer"": Scotland Yard authorities who believe he has not paid back taxes on several billion British pounds, and an international mob run by an older baddie who would kill not only a man who cheats on his wife, but he'll kill his wife too, and all the members of both families. He would even kill the man's doctor, just for good measure. The mob boss lost billions to the mystery who was once a trusted part of his organization. Part of the plot is the tried-and-true ""mistaken identity"" device in which the authorities and the mob appear to be confusing the clueless tourist with the unseen letter-writer. Everyone is sure the man they want is Depp.

A fun fantasy which combines elements of romantic-comedy and international espionage. There are a couple obligatory chase scenes and even a romantic interlude or two, with the compulsory ballroom scene and casino. What makes it work are the fine performances by Depp and Jolie. The ending is pretty interesting, but there are aspects during the film which don't quite mesh with some of the scenes which have occurred previously. But if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and let your imagination run wild, ""The Tourist"" is a fun treat, sort of like a nice bow of vanilla ice cream. French vanilla of course on Viennese China.",1394236800,,3391,4.783276450511946

4298249,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Johnny & Angelina don't really put out oscar winning performances, but this movie is more about the story, which still works even without stellar acting.
  Johnny is on the frumpy side, with facial hair that makes his face unattractively chubby-ish<like Billy Crystal>.He also, seems to not be able to shake his Jack Sparrow persona...using Jack's tipsy dimness & mumbling to portray shy & innocent, which really is a poor substitute. Angelina seems to be trying to present an Audrey Hepburn chic,classy gracefulness, that for some reason she can't quite pull off. Still, she is stunning & it's hard to look away.
  Do they have chemistry ? I didn't think so, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.
The chase scenes were, by modern terms, very, very slow. Also, the movie seemed to hold it's own without nudity, sex or alot of swearing. The ending was nice & tidy. Not a great movie, but certainly worthwhile.
  if you liked this movie you might like The Thomas Crown Affair(1999),which is somewhat similar...but I recommend the T.V. version because the dvd version is rated R (for nudity)",1392508800,,1087,4.848648648648648

4298290,4,B004A8ZWT2,"This is a nice throwback to classic spy, mystery, thriller, romance films of the 1960s.  Don't expect any frenetic car chases with fast-cut editing here.  This is all about picture-perfect settings, elegant women, and subtle dialogue that creates a sophisticated look and feel within the wonderful European charm that is Venice.

Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as a mysterious woman who oozes charm and seduction with every glance of her eye and subtle sway of her hips.  Scotland Yard and other European authorities are following her in hopes of finding a thief who has stolen a great deal of money.  Johnny Depp is a hapless tourist who through a chance meeting gets caught up in her web of activities and people tracking her.

The plot takes some small twists and turns that keep the viewer guessing a bit as to how things will turn out.  There is great cinematography amidst the wondrous canals of Venice, and no camera could love Jolie more than in this film.  Depp is drawn to her as a moth to the proverbial flame, and no man could blame him.

The movie falls short of a high level of excellence probably because of weaknesses in the script.  There were no glaring flaws exactly, but there were no clear strengths either beyond the basic concept.  However, the other film elements make up for this to create a fine escape with plenty of charm and eye candy from the settings and the personas of Jolie and Depp.  It's a nice tribute to an older style of European mystery-thriller and romantic-comedy filmmaking with a strong cast of modern actors in both the lead and supporting roles.",1390694400,,1593,4.7111913357400725

4298369,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Based on the French film ""Anthony Zimmer"" this movie is about a thief who is trying to reignite a romance with a woman he left for two years.  With a new face, a new voice, and a new name, he lures the woman to Venice where he plans to reveal himself and explain his long absence.  The problem comes when the man he stole a fortune from learns he is in Venice and comes after him with a team of Russian thugs.  This movie puts its stars, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in unusual roles; Depp is the romantic lead, and Jolie does not throw a single punch.  Although I don't think they ever connect as a romantic couple on camera, they are fun to watch.  The mistaken identity angle is intriguing, the scenes of Venice are spectacular, and the music is great.  ""The Tourist"" isn't perfect.  As I said Depp and Jolie never really connect as a romantic pair, and the ending is a little flat.  In an effort to make her glamorous, they put so much makeup on Jolie that she looks like a department store mannequin.  They could have wiped most of it off and she would be more beautiful.  With that said, ""The Tourist"" is a beautifully photographed movie, with great cast of characters, and enough intrigue to keep the plot moving.  I suggest watching ""The Tourist"" and ""Anthony Zimmer"" together, and enjoying how the same story can be told in such different ways.",1385769600,2,1355,4.423387096774194

The other reviewers do a good job of summarizing the story, so I won't repeat that here.

For the most part, the acting is very good in this movie, from Jolie and Depp to all the miscellaneous characters. There are twists and turns---and a few unexpected surprises---which means my attention was held throughout the film. It did, at times, become a bit unrealistic, almost bordering on silly, but that was ok.

Anyhow, if you need to see a movie that doesn't require a lot of mental thought or analysis, this is a good choice. There isn't excessive violence, sex, or foul language, which means it would be suitable for an older teen. For anyone under 15, I doubt they would enjoy it.",1385164800,,842,4.350318471337579

It is a wonderful movie.

 My personal experience watching the movie for the first time was laying in bed with a bunch of popcorn and eating it up really fast because it is dramatic and mysterious.

4298499,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Depp and Jolie headline this tale of intertwined story lines, who is who, what is happening, and who's doing what?  Jolie plays a high-profile beauty who also happens to be the significant other of a criminal who is on the run.  In order to throw Interpol off of her trail in her effort to be reunited with ""him"", she selects an American school teacher (Depp) seemingly at random while on a train, and gathers him into this web of intrigue.  He is clearly in over his head...with her, not to mention everything else.

Jolie and Depp do top-notch jobs.  The story is engaging, the character development is good, and you are not likely to figure out what's really going on until the very end.

There are great backdrops, and I have to say that even though I don't care much for who-dunnits I like this film and I'm very happy that it's part of my collection.

To sum up, I'd say that this is a dark horse film that received very little attention when it was released, and is something of an underdog.  I suggest that you give it a look/another look and see what you thnk.

There's enough action and intrigue to keep it interesting, and I liked the ending.  I even watched it a couple more times later on.  This is not, however, one of those iconic films that you will never forget and can't stop watching.  For one thing, Jolie's woman of mystery persona wears thin after awhile, and you get the feeling she is simply meant to be eye candy.  For another, there is no compelling character or love story in the film.  Even after it ends, you only care a little bit.  I would recommend it as a once-view or maybe a few views but not as a memorable, gotta-watch-it-or-I'll-die kind of movie.",1374019200,,776,4.492857142857143

4298558,4,B004A8ZWT2,"The Tourist(released Dec/10)stars,among others,Angelina Jolie as Elise Clifton-Ward,Johnny Depp as Frank Tupelo,Paul Bettany as Insp. John Acheson,Timothy Dalton as Chief Insp. Jones,Steven Berkoff as Reginald Shaw and others. I found this to be a very,very pleasant and enjoyable film to watch. The intrigue,the mystery,the plot twists and turns and the solid acting,all help propel this little number along.
The story finds Depp as the titled ""Tourist"".However,the movie starts out as the police in Paris,assisted by Scotland Yard in London,are busy following Jolie. Jolie is an ex Yard agent who they hadn't seen for a long time and who has been connected with one Alexander Pearce. Pearce it seems stole mega millions from a very nasty European mob boss,and not only are the police after him(thru Jolie),but the boss wants his bucks back pronto. At a cafe where Jolie sits a note is delivered to her via courier(from Pearce)and it tells her to board a train and head to Venice. Also it says to find and chat up another man on the train who has roughly the same build as him,so the police suspect that man is actually him.
The man Jolie chats up is our own Johnny Depp,a math teacher from Wisconsin. Depp of course becomes intrigued by this lovely enchantress sitting across from him. Jolie also feels an attraction but hides her feelings. In Venice she and Depp end up sharing a luxurious hotel suite there;Jolie sleeping in her own room,Depp on the couch. The next morning Jolie has left and is awoken by a servant bringing breakfast. When the servant leaves two thugs from the mob bosses`gang show up and Depp takes off across some rooftops to elude the men. He ends up being arrested. The policeman who interrogates him ,during the night,takes him out and delivers him into the hands of the mob boss,for a tidy payment. Jolie comes to the rescue and they both end up out in the Venetian harbour in a boat. Next morning Jolie delivers Depp to the airport and tells him to leave.
With Depp now gone,Jolie goes back to Scotland Yard and agrees to help her superiors in Pearce`s capture. She is wired and she attends a ball that night,as per the instructions of Pearce,through notes. Once there she is given another note by a man who rushes away. She follows him calling Pearce`s name. Who should suddenly appear,but Depp. They dance for a short time until she breaks off and leaves. The police,who are there en masse,take Depp into custody. They sequester Depp in the surveillance van,while Jolie is now inside a room,looking for a safe she was instructed to go to. In barges the mob boss with his men,who forces Jolie to tell him where the safe is. All this time police snipers on a nearby roof have had their guns trained on all of the baddies in the room,but the Yard cop in charge keeps delaying any firing;hoping for the appearance of the elusive Pearce. Jolie tries once to enter the safe code but fails and is given one more chance. Depp`s admonitions to the cops to jump into action to save Jole have fallen on deaf ears. Before the cops realize it,Depp has escaped the van,gone and entered the room from its balcony and now is inside confronting the boss,and pretending he is Pearce. As things look their worst the cop in charge`s boss comes in and orders the snipers to fire,which they do,taking down everyone but Depp and Jolie. As the two stand there Depp asks her how she now feels about him and this Pearce fellow. She replies she loves them both. Depp replies he may have a solution to the problem. Depp enters the safe code and opens it,something he would never have known if he wasn`t..... .The police arrive and Depp and Jolie are gone. They blow the closed safe to find a cheque made out in the amount that Pearce had stolen.
The film winds down as Depp and Jolie ply across the Venice harbour on a sailboat. Jolie makes the comment about all the money he spent on his facial reconstruction,and that was the best he could do? Depp asks ``you don`t like it``? Jolie says it will have to do.
Not only is the acting quite solid in this film,but it is all ably boosted by the cinematography and the beautiful background music. In fact at some parts,I saw some visual touches of Hitchcock, and could almost picture Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in these same roles. This movie definitely has touches of cinema from a by gone day,and it is rare to see that nowadays. The movie`s tension/intrigue starts out from the get go and I found it rarely let up until the two are sailing into the sunset. That nice twist ending was also a bonus.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,outtakes,an alternate animated opening and two featurettes.
All in all a nicely done film with elements of mystery and intrigue coupled with a light sexual tension between the two leading characters. It`s visual and audio touches really enhance the entire look and feel. Highly recommended.",1369008000,,4948,4.6819747416762345

Nice to see him get away from being (far too frequently) so quirky all of the time.

4298629,3,B004A8ZWT2,"The thing that ruined this movie for me was, of all things, the music.  It was scored like a romance, paced like a thriller.  But was rarely thrilling. They tried a cross-genre mix that didn't work. But the music killed it - it was so badly scored that it pulled me out of the movie every time a ""soaring"" theme played.

I thought Johnny Depp was wooden, and he kept speaking throughout the movie with an odd American/British accent - I was confused, but in the end it seems like it may have been intentional.  He's such a good actor that I gave him the benefit of the doubt throughout the movie - but again, this pulled me out of the moment.

There's very little chemistry between Jolie and Depp - at one point she shifts from 'playing him' to being in love with him, but as a viewer you miss the transition and go, ""wait - now she's in love with him?  When did that happen?""  And even that he is in love with her feels odd and wooden.  The movie might have worked if it were an hour longer, re-edited, and definitely re-scored.

If you like the old films starring Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn etc like I do... then you will very likely love this movie too. I relate it to Charade, To Catch a Thief, How to Steal a Million....and I think it pulls it off excellently! The chemestry between Jolie and Depp is electric and I would happily see them play opposite each other again and again, in the style of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The direction isn't perfect, but in the finale I get goosebumps every time. And that soundtrack is gorgeous!

The blu-ray has great picture and sound; and the special features are enough to add to the enjoyment of the film.

4298656,3,B004A8ZWT2,"For starters I am almost always willing to take a chance on anything, any film that the madcap actor (and my muse the late Hunter Thompson's friend) Johnny Depp puts his name to. With rare exceptions (the big one being his role as that self-same Hunter Thompson in the film adaptation of his book Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas) I have not been disappointed. And while I was not disappointed here the story line, and the antic -laden thriller did not do justice to his, or co-star Angela Joie's (she of the big lips in the title), talents.

After all how hot and bothered is one to get over the whereabouts of a crackerjack thief, dough thief, big dough, billions and that is big dough even today, from a British gangster, and from the British tax boys looking for their graft, named Alexander Pearce anyway. And also constantly following a beautiful woman with big luscious red lips and a quaky English accent and who is filled to the brim, filled I tell you, with ennui looking to meet her man. And of course that gangster, that nasty gangster full of hubris and quirky habits. The problem though,  and this may have to do with the nature of star power and Hollywood's take on it, is how far into the movie will it take to figure out who that Mister Pearce really is.

Depp is always good, although he affects a sort of weird accent, sometimes euro sounding, for a Wisconsin shcool teacher.

5 - I loved it
4 - I really like it
3 - I like it/Worth a look
2 - Don't like it
1 - Hate it

Even though I felt this movie had potential, I just can't give it more than one star. This movie is a mess. I get that it was trying to capture the feel of a 60's romantic thriller, like Charade, but it fails miserably. As my review title says, go watch Charade instead. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant were two of the most glamourous stars of their time. Hepburn was beautiful and when it came to fashion was one of the most stylish women around. Cary Grant was suave and super cool, it's easy to see anyone falling for his charms. I'd love it if they'd just release this movie theaters. They used to do that more often, but now you can only see an older movie in theaters if you're lucky enough to have a theater that plays them. I don't think I really need to go into the plot of this movie, there are plenty out there and of course there was the trailer for it as well. I recall this movie got a lot of promotions and even had giant cardboard displays at theaters. And why not, it stars two of the biggest actors today, Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.

This part is gonna stir up some controversy because of what I'm about to say; I'm not a fan of Angelina Jolie. I've never seen the hype of her as an actress. And this has nothing to do with the whole Jennifer Aniston/Brad Pitt thing; Hollywood has plenty of this kind of drama going on that it's nothing new. I admit I enjoyed her in Girl, Interrupted, she did a great job in that movie as well as the rest of the cast. In fact her earlier work is way better given that she did riskier roles compared to now. Just about every role she takes on is just very standard Hollywood, and when she was first getting big she was doing all kinds of unconventional roles. I recommend seeing the movie Gia where she plays a drug addicted model, it's a sad movie (based on a true story as well) but it's well made and acted. I also enjoy her in the Kung Fu Panda movies, although the major highlights of those movies come from the action and comedy. But in a way those movies go with her conventional roles of playing a tough as nails women like in Lara Croft or Wanted. So yes, she's done some good movies here and there. But for the most part, she's just meh. She rarely does a lot of emoting in movies, and giving a cold stare the whole time doesn't mean you're acting and giving any real depth. And sure I can see that she's an attractive woman, but not so much in recent years. She's started getting way too thin. And in terms of acting, her other half Brad Pitt is way better and has done some more interesting roles. This movie doesn't help with her looks either. There's the heavy makeup she's wearing and she looks silly with her attempt at a sexy walk. Really I'd say Girl, Interrupted was her last real daring role where she showed off some raw emotion and showed that she can act. But most of the things she does now are just her looking pretty, or trying to be a bad@$$. Now I still need to see some of her newer films. I haven't seen Changeling yet, but my main reason for wanting to see that is because it's directed by Clint Eastwood, who is really good at working with actors and getting them to give a decent performance.

As for Johnny Depp, I love the guy. He has a natural charm for sure. Yes in recent years he too has done more standard roles as well. But he at least still entertains me with these performances; Captain Jack Sparrow has become one of my favorite movie characters. And even in more standard films he seems to at least be putting in some effort, more than I can say for Jolie in most things. Not so much in this movie though. I'd say he was doing it for the paycheck. There's a quote by Jolie that she was just doing because she thought hey it'll be a quick shoot and she had nothing better to do. That's the secondary problem with this movie too. Neither are really putting effort in their performances. I can't really buy Depp as a simple math teacher; Depp has no business playing a normal person. His most normal performance was probably the original Nightmare on Elm Street, and that was a supernatural slasher film where he got sucked into a bed followed by a geyser of blood. The other would probably be What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but even in that he was part of dysfunctional family and surrounded by eccentrics. See both movies if you haven't, they're classics.

The primary problem with this movie is that it's predictable. Even from the trailer it was super obvious that Depp's character was going to be this international thief, otherwise it wouldn't be exciting enough. If you're star is Depp, of course he's going to be the suspect. Course this movie fails to be exciting as everything moves slowly. I'm guessing the $100 million budget was mainly because Jolie and Depp cost a lot of money. Course I'm sure Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton weren't cheap either. I've seen more exciting, fast paced action films that didn't cost nearly this much. The 2006 actioner Shoot 'Em Up cost $39 million to make, that's more than half of what this movie cost. Look at the first Terminator movie, it only cost $6 million. Sure it's sequel cost $100 million, BUT that movie was fast paced and awesome! The 2003 Italian Job cost $60 million and was more exciting than this; sure it wasn't a fantastic movie but it was at least fun. This movie spends most of it's time wanting to show off the Venice. Sure Venice looks great, but this is supposed to be a thriller with some action and such. It doesn't deliver very well on that. The George Clooney film The American (released the same year) cost $20 million and had some stunning Italy landscapes, and it's pace was slow too, but it did it in a way that was able to still build tension and have some mystery to it. Now I can see the American dividing opinions, but I'll still stand by what I said when I think it has a more engaging plot. Since the twist of the Tourist is obvious, it just leaves you thinking of when they're finally going to reveal when Depp finally admits he's the prime suspect. If he and Jolie had chemistry and actually put effort into their performances I could ignore that because I'd least be entertained. But they don't, and it just gets really tedious. Going back to Charade, certain things were obvious, but again it had a great pace and Hepburn and Grant had excellent chemistry and used their charms. But Depp just looks bored. Say what you will about any of the Pirates sequels, but at least then you can tell he's having a good time in those movies. Also those movies used their budgets well to give us some mind blowing special effects and awesome action scenes (the whirlpool fight in World's End is EPIC!) and the rest of the cast I'm sure see he's having fun so they try to have fun. This movie though isn't fun though, another thing that Charade has above this movie. Most of the cast seems to be trying, but it really isn't enough if your leads can't wake up and do some acting.

That's really all I have to say. Hope I didn't ramble on too long. While this may not be super informative of the movie itself, I hope it at least entertained and I've managed to get people to watch the other movies I talked about. Seriously, any one of those movies is a lot more fun that this one.",1352160000,,7365,4.307137707281903

4298923,1,B004A8ZWT2,"I deleted my original review. I was so shocked by Angelina Jolie's appearance, or changed appearance is more accurate, to settle down and ""taken in"" the movie as I might have. The one thing writers and directors strive to impart in their characters is to bring out at least one facet in the role that the viewers connect with or find appealing...in other words, the good guys are suppose to be liked by the audience on some level. This film role for Jolie was flat and single faceted...no emotional or kindred spirit the viewers could have invested any rousing interest in, or even like very much. Her wardrobe was as flat and benign as her role. One would not have been surprised to have it suddenly revealed that she is really an emotion less clone of the real woman she is supposed to be. I couldn't help wondering what the director was aiming for...certainly no positive connection with the viewers. The plot of the film is very good and deserved a much better delivery from the director. THAT much I DID take in. Johnny Depp? Looking unkempt and careless with his grooming works for Pirates of the Caribbean. All it does in this film is sharpen the contrast between his character and Joli's to the point of being an impossible to accept. I think it was the hair growing over his lips and his truly nasty looking stained teeth that plopped him into the ""yuck"" category. What a shame all the way around.....when the characters are directed in such a way as to distract the viewers from the actual plot, well...you end up with a great plot that remains unfulfilled and dead in the water; one not all the action/special effects scenes can keep afloat.

4298968,5,B004A8ZWT2,"Reviewers who disliked this film felt it was too slow and could have been edited and improved by deleting a third of it without harming the plot. They also disliked the acting which they felt was too laid back. I can understand that they felt this; however, I agree with the reviewers who saw these facts as positives. I felt that I was being drawn into the film little by little, wondering what was going on, who were these people, what were they after, who were the good guys, and why was the bad guy bad. These questions were not off-putting, but to the contrary, they added to the suspense. I also liked the acting, the scenery, the glamour, and the surprise ending.

The only criticism that I see is that the plot is unrealistic. If a very rich man, a billionaire, wants to evade capture by the police and the man he stole the billions from, he wouldn't need to go through the elaborate sequence of shifty and sly maneuvers that the film's character goes through. But this really doesn't bother me. I also like sci-fi films which are not realistic. One should allow story tellers to tell stories in their own way, as long as there is internal consistency and the story is entertaining, and this film was entertaining.",1343001600,,1222,4.529411764705882

4298988,5,B004A8ZWT2,"There was a time, oh, from 50-60 years ago back to the beginning of film, when Hollywood regularly turned out smart, sophisticated, glamourous movies.  They were stylish and adult and entertaining.  Think ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" or ""Casablanca"" or ""The Story of Eve"" or ""The Seven Year Itch"" and you will know the type of stylish, sophisticated glamour I'm talking about.  Yes, there have been some newer ones that were similar to the old ones...""The Thomas Crown Affair"" for one, but they are far too rare.

""The Tourist"" is utterly beautiful from the first frame to the last.  It's a pleasure to see Johnny Depp being so endearingly appealing, and Jolie at her absolute most stunningly gorgeous best.  Sadly, this movie won't appeal to most of today's audiences because there's no gore, no CGI, no breakneck action, no foul language, no sex; in short none at all of the things most audiences go to the movies for today.

The story needs no more talking about since so many reviewers have already outlined it, so, like I usually do, I will simply tell you why I like it.  It's a fun movie with humor, style, intelligence, elegance, romance, and lots of sophistication.

No, I don't put it into the same category as a Cary Grant or Bergman movie, and, no, I don't think in 50 or 60 years people will still be talking about it.  It's not a classic.  But it is well worth the time and money to see it, own it, and watch it several times.  It's a lot of fun.",1333152000,2,1464,4.524714828897339

And what a lucky coincidence that all the ashes just happened to scan into the computer right-side-up! Even better that the first two words they just happened to manage to put together were the numbers 822 and the French word for train, so they could figure out where Angelina's character, Elise, was going. After all, they didn't really need to know the rest of the message until later! Well, I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie, so of course I kept watching, and the movie was much better from that point on.

This was a pretty interesting role for Johnny Depp. He usually does such weird stuff, and Frank had to be his most normal character ever. It was actually WEIRD to see him playing someone so normal! Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie were a decent match, although I was never really sure what Frank saw in Elise besides the fact that she was gorgeous.

And of course the scenery was beautiful. I totally wanted to go back to Venice after watching the movie. (If only I could stay in one of those hotels instead of a group hostel!) It is one of the most gorgeous cities in the world and absolutely the most unique.",1333152000,2,1254,4.424242424242424

I love Johnny Depp but he had no personality, Angelina Jolie reminded me of Jessica Rabbit (Who killed Roger Rabbit?) whenever she walked anywhere with all the mouths dropping open & everything coming to a halt.

If you like ""caper"" films such as ""Charade,""  ""It Takes a Thief,"" or ""How to Steal a Million,"" with stars Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Peter O'Toole, and Cary Grant; this is a film you'll probably enjoy. If you're hoping to see Angeline Jolie in a bodysuit, kicking butt with a flamboyant Jack Sparrow, you're going to be disappointed. Depp is known for tackling a wide range of roles, from Edward Scissorhands to Don Juan de Marco. In this film, he verges on being a dweeb, complete with a full set of pajamas--the kind men used to wear--with nary a chest hair in sight. Nevertheless, Depp's self-deprecating Frank Tupelo never seems ridiculous; rather he seems like a man caught up in an adventure he could only have imagined happening to someone else. Frank may not be suave and debonair, but he's resourceful and funny; traits that keep us, and Jolie's character, Elise, from writing him off too quickly. Although Jolie is convincingly enigmatic and glamorous, her performance is not as nuanced as that of Depp. We catch hints of emotional depths, but they remain hints. We never really understand what makes her tick. The rest of the film is solid: there is a good supporting cast, the costumes are spot-on, and the photography of Venice makes you want to catch the nearest plane for Italy. This movie was a very pleasant change from films that bombard you with special effects or scenes of graphic sex and/or violence in order to keep your attention. And if you can avoid typecasting the two leads based on previous roles, you may decide, as I did, that ""The Tourist"" is a gem that deserves to be discovered.",1332633600,2,1654,4.743055555555555

We have both of those movies on DVD and watch them regularly with renewed pleasure each time. This movie offers the same level of fun and adventure with the added benefit of Johnny Depp's natural ability to be funny; I have no difficulty placing him in the same category as Cary Grant and Peter Sellers. It has action, beautiful scenery, a well done script, effective character portrayal by Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, good acting in the supporting roles, and a variety of interesting special features.

We really enjoyed watching the film with one exception; the surround channels sound level sometimes masked the dialogue to the point we couldn't understand what was being said. There was, however, a simple solution; we activated the English subtitles and the problem was solved. (For the record all of the speakers are balanced within +/- 1 decibel)

Both my wife and I enjoyed the movie and had fun watching it. If you're a fan of the Alfred Hitchcock movies or the Pink Panther movies I think you'll have fun with this one too.",1332288000,2,1145,4.748743718592965
4298994,2,B004A8ZWT2,"A movie like The Tourist is hard to be objective about when it comes with such star power, the critics widely trash it, and it goes from big screen to dvd within weeks. Even Ricky Gervais dog-piled not once, but twice to Johnny Depp's face during back to back Golden Globes ceremonies. I fully expected a total train wreck when I got around to watching it.

It's not a train wreck but it's not very good. In going for the narrow lightweight espionage/romance/travelogue genre, The Tourist comes across as nothing more than a pale imitation. Jolie can pull of old time movie star appeal but her cheesy British accent offsets any credibility her glamour points get. Furthermore, she doesn't so much act as model clothes and jewelry. Depp doesn't even try for suave and goes straight for schleppy teacher clich. I kept wishing he would visit a barber and transform, but he doesn't. In the milieu this movie strives to reproduce, even regular folk like Depp's character would be credited with a modicum of style and sophistication. In a movie that goes for style with substance, it was a poor omission. Furthermore, the heat between the two stars was tepid at best, as were the performances that wavered between mildly amused and comatose.

The Tourist is a gorgeous movie that surprised me more than I thought it would with touches of droll humor and a nostalgic tip of the hat to movies we are hard-pressed to find anymore. In the end, however, it seemed only able to recreate the lovely wrapping paper while leaving the box inside empty.",1331596800,,1536,4.727611940298507

First warning sign that this movie would be terrible was that Angelina Jolie was in it. She has to be the most overrated actress currently active in the film world. I sat through the first twenty thirty minutes... and i couldn't stand watching this turd anymore. Angelina Jolie is not only a horrible actress but she looks like an emaciated corpse with a pair of collagen-implant-surgery gone wrong set of lips-the director should have just cast the remains of Rin-Tin-Tin instead of this walking corpse.

Any resemblance to the clever and sparkling caper films (Charade, To Catch a Thief) is non-existent.

I liked the beginning of this movie, thanks to Johnny Depp's' sweet portrayal of a mousey math teacher who naively speaks Spanish to Italians and can't believe his luck in meeting the glamorous and desirable Elise. Jolie seems less an actress than a model, posing with pouty lips and strutting around in designer clothes. She exhibits little emotion and is completely unconvincing as a Brit. The photography of Venice is so lovely, though, that it almost makes up for Angelina's miscasting. The movie starts off as a clever and fast-paced spy story but becomes muddled and even a bit boring later on; the twist-ending didn't seem to fit.

All in all, this is a pretty but silly movie full of plot holes that doesn't seem to know if it's a comedy, romance, or thriller.",1328400000,,1044,4.730769230769231

Johnny Depp is no Carey Grant and underplays his role as the titular tourist; this movie doesn't do anything to add to his stardom (and it certainly wouldn't be thrusting him toward stardom if he weren't already a movie star).  Angelina gets the far better role here.  There are a couple of twists of course (one in the middle that I didn't see coming and the one at the end that was pretty easy to see ahead of time--but I won't ruin either of them here).  For me the most interesting character was Paul Bettany's Inspector who was WASPish in his desire to capture the film's ""villain"" and whose tone-on frustration in being repeatedly thwarted or overruled at every turn was a delight to watch.",1328227200,,823,4.616438356164384

Angelina Jolie standing there looking glamorous does nothing for me, and Johnny Depp, a gifted actor with long, unwashed hair, was wasted here. The real star was Venice.

4299022,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, The Tourist is romantic thriller/comedy from 2010.  The central lead is Elise (Jolie), who is being pursued while on the hunt for her lover Alexander Pearce, a man who is on the run after reportedly stealing big dollars from a gangster.  Elise teams up with the unsuspecting Frank (Depp), forcing her pursuers to think he is Pearce in disguise, only to spark a thrilling chase through Venice involving both police and gangsters, both of whom are desperate to catch Pearce.  But will Elise and Frank survive, and will Pearce eventually show up?

In comparison to most modern thrillers, this is a slow-paced film, and not surprisingly it's been criticized by many for being devoid of action, and for lacking chemistry.  But what many perceive to be a weakness, I'd consider to be a strength.  The slow pace and apparent lifelessness seems to be a deliberate throwback to the older Hitchcock style thrillers, adding to the intrigue.  And while Jolie's persona comes across as cold and calculating (an effect maximized by excessive and immaculate makeup), it's her fidelity to Pearce that holds her back from Frank.  The respite from the usual sexual smut Hollywood is known for is welcome, and the amount of offensive material we're used to from contemporary thrillers is refreshingly absent for the most part, aside from a few instances of crude language.  It's true that the storyline lacks high octane action and special effects, but the romp through Venice is a visually pleasing one, and despite their cool interaction, the two protagonists keep the story moving and our curiosity aroused.

My only criticism would be concerning the surprising twist in the storyline at the very end of the film.  On the one hand it's a very well orchestrated surprise, but it does make the actions and motives of one of the characters earlier in the film rather implausible.  But at the end of the day, we shouldn't be taking this too seriously anyway, but just enjoy the ride.  If you're up for something slower and are happy to avoid some of the more offensive material that usually plagues Hollywood, why don't you hop on board this tourist boat and head to Venice? - GODLY GADFLY",1327276800,,2210,4.877005347593583

It has so many twists and turns through out the movie that it will keep you on the edge of your seat trying figure out what happens next! You can't even guess the ending (unless you have seen the movie before)! An elegant Jolie/Depp mystery set in beautiful Venice! It takes over two years before Jolie begins her long awaited adventure. Jolie is dressed beautifully through out the movie, wearing clothes that most women could only hope to wear and her make up is flawless for every scene! Because she is intelligent and beautiful this allows her to get away with more. She tries everything to get what she so desperately wants/needs. Depp plays the part of a man she meets on a train. He certainly continues interfere with things to cause frustration in every plan Jolie has made. Did he fall in love with her or is there another reason to his insisting and interrupting behavior? Does he have other motives of his own? Why does he stick around to trip up her every move? She clearly gets exhausted with his interruptions!

All of sudden if it wasn't enough to have Depp and the police watching her every move--the mob begins to watch and interfere! Desperate to reach her goal, she tries so hard through out the movie to plot her next move. It is a chase to the end!

Sophisticated in its beauty, lush with Venetian motif, and with such charming actors, to watch The Tourist is to become enchanted with the imagery and the romantic idea of Venice, more than with Venice itself.  The Tourist is to Venice what Roman Holiday is to Rome.

The movie's soundtrack is effective if not memorable, with a few nice surprises, including an appropriately subtle taste of Katie Melua in one scene which made me fall in love with her vocals all over again.

Apart from the imagery is a casually-paced plot with enough humor and suspense to sustain interest throughout the movie, but is it enough to make this a classic?  Will this stand the test of time?

4299044,5,B004A8ZWT2,"I fell in love with Venice and with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie while watching this film. Wonderful escapism as the viewer is allowed to enter vicariously, the exclusive life-style of the ultra-wealthy (chic Jolie)and unexpected adventure of Everyman (unassuming Depp). For me the movie was a graceful integration of elements in To Catch A Thief and North By Northwest. The beautiful Venetian waterscape and architecture captured in the cinematography draws me into 'vacation mode', as if I'm a tourist there. Jolie plays a strong, in-control, and commanding personality that is at the same time softened by vulnerability, empathy, graciousness and poise. Now I want to emulate that character as well. Depp is amazing with the overlapping qualities of vulnerability and sensitivity of his own, as he navigates unforeseen circumstances with courage mingled within fear, as a tourist in a foreign country. I also loved the performances of Timothy Dalton -- patient, wise and likable, and Paul Bettany -- relentless, dogged, and frustrated to the end (compared to his brilliant acting as the 'Albino' in The Da Vinci Code). This movie should be stacked next to Cary Grant and Grace Kelly on your shelves, as it does mine. Masterful acting, smooth yet gripping script, and a classic feel which lacks the gruesome violence and lust so prevalent today.",1321660800,45,1349,5.192660550458716
4299045,2,B004A8ZWT2,"This movie would probably get one star if not for the gorgeous setting of Venice where most of the story takes place. Although the story is pretty good and has some nice twists, it plods beyond belief when Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie converse. I felt there was virtually no chemistry between the two. Depp seemed totally miscast as a fish out of water and the stumblebum type jokes he's scripted seem forced.

Jolie just comes across as a bonerack with big...lips. Put it this way, she's no Sophia Loren when she glams it up. I think she works far better in the Salt/Tomb Raider roles where she kicks serious butt even if someone as skinny as she is being a world beater seems beyond belief.

The director is mainly why this thing falls so flat and despite a terrific performance by Paul Bettany as the cop on Depp and Jolie's trail. It seems like he couldn't decide how to pace the story because it crawls to a halt in those scenes not involving the cops staking out the couple. This seems incongruous as you have two huge stars who should command the screen when they are together. They don't and it's hard to explain why.

The extras are also hit and miss. The short on the glamour of Venice and the classic looks the cast are dressed is fascinating as is the alternate title sequence which is animated (although I have no idea how the pyramids and a hot air balloon got in there). The explanation of the gala came across as pretentious twaddle, the outtakes are just so-so and the director commentary is a waste of time.

4299084,4,B004A8ZWT2,"I got interested in the reviews of this moview when I found many very low.  Most of these find it light or boring, a waste of superstar talent, etc.

Now, I'm not going to go through all the hundreds of negative reviews here and on IMDB, but the ones I have read I think are missing a critical point.

The chief characters in this film are living in a world where the people they are dealing with are corrupt up to their shifty eyeballs. Count the number of people on the take.  Or, take, the surveillance crew who zoom in on Elise to see if she is wearing underwear.  Or, notice the ""bad guy"" is a globe-trotting serial killer for the heck of it and no one seems to care much.  Or the fact that the police of Europe are all over trying to find the missing guy who stole (?) billions from the serial killer only so that the government can get its cut(taxes).

My take on this:

Here are two very intelligent people in the midst of this mess who are in love but have strong reasons to distrust each other (why not...nearly everyone else is betraying something or someone).  How can they regain each other's trust?

I happened to like the movie a lot because it had romantic music, showed colorful shots of Venice, had the two stars doing very well exactly what stars do in movies.  I like it even more now that I've realized that it does actually make a point.  It reminds me a lot of Casablanca, except in that film everyone has the integrity to hate the serial killers; but The Tourist has a better ending.

Note --

The missing person has not given word on his whereabouts to Elise for two years.  What is the first thing he says to her?",1316995200,3,1639,4.258899676375404
4299085,4,B004A8ZWT2,"This Movie has an awesome cast which is really its strength point. Angeline Jolie and Johnny Depp in the lead, now who wouldn't want to see that ??

However, that being said the movie is clearly not a life changing one. If you watched the trailer already you should know you won't be hearing about The Tourist in the next  Academy Oscar Awards. However, the trailer is a bit deceiving while this movie has *some* action scenes involved the action is very light. So, this isn't a mindless action film full of chasing cars, swashbuckling heroes, and flying motorbikes. It has all the elements necessary to make a typical action film (Hero/Heroine, Government and secret agents, spying, High tech spying supplies, Evil Gangs, the Bad Guys, Murder etc, etc..) But for some reason the movie doesn't focus on these elements entirely thus the action is rather lacking, action fans you'll be disappointed.

What we get instead, is something else. If I can describe this film in one word it would ""sweet"". It has a sweet romance and some tender moments as a backstory. The Scenery is also a plus in here. You got a beautiful view once in a while of gorgeous European cities and being a travel freak I enjoyed that.

I heard people complain about the lack of nudity in this film. I personally didn't mind that, I'm in no way a prude but I'm not a fan of mindless sex scenes and I didn't find a legitimate reason for the Hero/Heroine to have sex till about the last 5 minutes of the film.

In the end I would give this a rent if for nothing else just to see Johnny Depp wandering in Italy trying to chase the woman he thinks he loves. Worth it ? I think so !",1316995200,,1647,4.422442244224422
4299086,4,B004A8ZWT2,"I will start out by saying, I don't like movies with lots of sex, nudity, cursing, violence, etc. Consequently I was debating watching this movie, because it certainly could have swung that way. It didn't, much to my delight. Oh there is violence, guns chase scenes (but so do all action movies), but thankfully, it stopped there, no blood splattering all over, no gruesome injuries. There was romance, The ""worst"" two scenes were in the hotel, where Jolie is getting undressed and you see her underwear (which covered a good deal more than most swimsuits), and also where Depp dreams he goes into her room and begins to make out with her (this scene is brief). Thats about it.  There is cursing, but its not so prevalent (that I remember) as to make me reject the movie based on that.

Basically, its an action movie, chase scenes, gun fire, mobsters.  There is romance and attraction.  The plot is fun and engaging.  (and it was rather fun to see favorite actors from other movies) Its clean enough that I will watch it again.

There isn't a single plot device here that hasn't been used with better outcome with much smaller budgets and lesser known actors.

4299118,1,B004A8ZWT2,"Here's the thing; this should have been amazing.  First you have the cast.  Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp are two of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, and they are both talented (albeit overrated, but talented).  They ooze this charisma that makes their actorly flaws seem irrelevant at times.  Then you have the director.  Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has one other feature length film under his belt; 2006's Oscar winning film `The Lives of Others'.  That film is amazing and his directing of it was flawless (he should have been nominated in the directing category).  Then you have the story; a solid mix of action and mystery and you have that beautiful setting; Venice.

None of it works.

The setting, while beautiful, feels cheap.  The actors, while talented, lack any real chemistry and don't evoke any emotions.  Angelina relies on her fading good looks to keep us engaged and Depp tries to play quirky again and misfires.  Sadly, Paul Bettany has been further reduced to stereotypical `obstacle' and does absolutely nothing with the role (quick, Russell Crowe, come to his rescue).  The direction is also just standard and uninspired.  It felt like almost every frame was ripped from a better Cary Grant/Alfred Hitchcock collaboration.  The story had all the elements for a nice capper and yet it felt underdeveloped and stale.

Angelina does nothing by pout her lips and smolder.  Depp does nothing but try to pull off ignorant.  Bettany does nothing by bark into the phone.

I liked the twist at the end even if it felt too predictable (and nonsensical at that), but the construction of the film as a whole was a total mess.  I'm just so upset over this.  I really wanted von Donnersmarck to follow up his brilliant debut with something a little more profound, or at least a little more epic (considering the genre and stars he chose).  Instead, `The Tourist' feels too tepid and too insipid to matter in the slightest.  I think the funniest thing about this movie is the fact that the Globes nominated it in the Comedy category.  It's not funny (at least not intentionally).  It didn't deserve to be nominated for anything, but the fact that they changed the whole genre to fit their need to nominate big name stars is just hilarious.

4299121,3,B004A8ZWT2,"I enjoyed The Tourist. It's not a life changing, Oscar worthy movie, but was something interesting to pass the time. I particularly enjoyed the ending. It was a nice surprise and I smiled and thought ""that's cute."" I have no idea what it's genre is though. I don't see it as a comedy (doesn't have a lot of laughs), not a drama, not a thriller (nothing thrilling about it), not adventure, not action (there's no action except a bland running away scene), romance? Could be, but there's really no romance between the two characters. They kiss probably 3 times and there's really no passion or intimacy.
As most have said, yes the scenery is gorgeous, stunning. The hotel Jolie and Depp stay in is beautiful. Seeing it all makes you wish you could be like this Alexander Pierce that everyone is after, with his stolen billions, so you can live in breathtaking Italy.
On to the flaws--the actors. Jolie is my favourtie modern actress. She's original, unique, different and I consider her one of the most beautiful women on earth--when she had on weight. In her last few movies for the past few years, she's unattractively skinny. She's not the take-your-breath-away beauty anymore, and it's because she's so damn skinny. Besides from her alarming and unsettling appearance, she's very stiff in this, and doesn't show much emotion. She swishes around in heavy makeup, long hair needing a cut, and dresses I actually consider ugly. There's a scene where she's very Audrey Hepburn with her dark sunglasses and pearls, and was the one outfit I liked, but they didn't show enough of her in that scene.
Non-emotion goes for Depp as well. I felt he played his part even worse than Jolie. What the hell is up with Depp in this movie?! HIM, not his character, seems slow, lethargic, bored, out of his element. He plays it with no force or vigor. He has a little interest in playing his character but just not enough. The face expressions are there, but the energy and movement aren't (Bad guys are running after him, and he's scared, his face shows it a bit, but there's nothing within projecting). His face is also bloated, old, and unattractive. Seeing him ""normal"", you see that he's short and petite in stature. I don't consider JD ugly, but never swooned over him or saw him as sexy. This movie solidifies that he does nothing for me. But I've always aloofly admired him and his movies; the fact he chose to play oddball characters, instead of the the action hero or the hot guy. Some reviewers have answered my question about what's wrong with Depp, and I agree with them that it's because he's only comfortable playing eccentric characters. For him to be normal, is to be a walking corpse, basically. Jolie has more range and can be different characters while still being ""very Angelina"" in each.
The supporting actors give much better performances. Bettany gets an A for giving his best to be the lead detective. The only other I consider lifeless like Jolie and Depp, is the bad guy Alexander stole from. Who they refer to as the ""gangster."" He's not intimidating at all and seems to be acting just to receive the paycheck.
All in all, watch this movie if you want to be transported to a beautiful mediterranean country called Italy, and would like to be entertained with a charming story about identity. Not for those that seek action, hate lighthearted, fluffy movies of the '50's and '60's, or require great acting from the actors.",1313884800,,3431,4.710482529118137

It might have been more appealing had Rufus Sewell and Johnny Depp swapped roles. Too much Princess Grace/Sophia Loren melodrama for this viewer's taste. Have to wonder if today's movie goers don't appreciate it as much as the older generations did back in the day.

The movie had too much of an ""Aren't I the most beautiful woman in the world?"" vibe from the too thin Angela Jolie, who is an impressive actress usually. (She does nice British accent as does Depp.) But actresses ""back in the day"" had curves. Not Jolie. She's apparently dieted them all away. Johnny Depp is a favorite, but not in this role. And definitely not with that hair. However, if the producers were trying to make him look ridiculous, it worked.

Venice is breathtaking, but Rufus Sewell is even more breathtaking. Not nearly enough of him in the movie. Just a few titillating glimpses. Timothy Dalton and Paul Bettany were two more excellent additions to the cast.

I'm not going to write an extensive review because, with all the reviews before mine, I probably wouldn't be adding anything that wasn't already discussed.

I have a personal gauge for whether or not I enjoy a movie.  It depends on how quickly time seems to go by during the movie.  I've sat through what I thought were bad movies that seemed to go on forever.  For the good ones, time seems to fly by.  This movie falls into the latter category for me.  My wife picked it because it was set in Venice, Italy, and we will be traveling there in a couple of months.  When we started watching the movie, it was early evening and still light outside.  At the end, it was completely dark outside.  I looked around and couldn't believe it was so dark.  I was completely caught up in the movie.

If you're looking for a really deep plot, you probably will be disappointed.  Watch the movie with the idea of just having a good time and maybe you'll get lost in it as I did.  And I loved the ending!",1309910400,5,1128,4.279620853080568
4299209,3,B004A8ZWT2,"SPOILER:  I agree with the last reviewer that they both did not look their best.  AJ's hair was truly ridiculous.  I really hated the ending.  I wanted him to be the math teacher and plastic surgery plot twists never worked for me-its just not believable.  And I wanted to hate the other guy-I wanted him to abandon her at the end and let the nice guy get the girl.  Also, Depp played the character as if he were the math teacher until the end.  On the train, there was no inkling that he was Alex, all his expressions seemed very genuine, like his reaction to this beautiful woman sitting with him.  Was Alex supposed to be an Oscar-winning actor?  The only problem with getting my wish that he really was the math teacher, is you could never see a woman like her falling for a guy like that, no matter how sweet or good-looking.  So in a way, they had to make the plot twist for a happy ending.  The solution?  Why did he have to be a math teacher?  They could have made him more interesting in his own right and fixed the problem.  On the bright side, Depp was charming as always in his inimitable way.  He plays innocents very well-that's why I think the character should have remained innocent-you wanted to believe in him.  AJ does show some depth and maturity here.  Some have said she was too expressionless, but one could also interpret that as minimalism.  Its better than over-acting, anyway.  There was too much focus on her looks but she was supposed to be a glamorous woman(or at least pretending to be-another problem-was she really believable as a govt agent?), so I'm not sure we should complain.  Sexually titillating, not a family film and a bit violent for my taste.  Not all bad, but a really disappointing ending, imho.",1309651200,,1741,4.480891719745223

Depp is a total frump and Jolie is frighteningly skinny and badly made up, with hair that looks like it needs washing and is probably not her own. The premise is hard to believe. It's not a thriller. It's a watered-down Hollywood confection. But, there is Venice and stereotyped Italian cops -- where is Giancarlo Giannini when you need him? As one reviewer pointed out, it starts slowly.

4299211,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Watching this movie gave me an epiphany about Johnny Depp's career, and that is his movies, especially those in the past decade, are about individuals who use planning and smarts to defeat those who have strength and numbers on their side.  His POTC movies are great examples of this as he outwits Captains Barbossa, Davy Jones, Norrington, Blackbeard and Cutler Beckett.  He does something similar in this movie, though his antagonists now are members of organized crime and Scotland Yard.  Though the trailers bill this movie as an action thriller, it is more of a mystery movie, with some comedy, some action, and some romance thrown in.  The dialog is very good, both between the two stars, and among the lesser cast members, especially given the fact that both Depp and Jolie are known more for their action movies than anything else.  The cast also features many other big names of past and present, such as Timothy Dalton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Bettany.  Overall, a great movie, and one that will keep you guessing towards the very end.",1309046400,3,1044,4.837078651685394
4299212,2,B004A8ZWT2,"With such a great cast, I was expecting a very exciting movie. The whole movie was seen by the preview shown on TV. It had one little plot twist at the end that just was not enough to make the movie worth watching.",1308873600,2,214,4.0
4299213,1,B004A8ZWT2,"I had to see this movie to answer the obvious question: If you put Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in a movie together, do you get a really good movie or a really bad one? Evidently, you get a really bad one.

The whole thing is about A.J.'s thickly-lacquered face with its over-inflated lips gliding along - either when she's ambulating down the street or floating by in a motorboat. Let's just say she doesn't show a lot of range. She never - not once - changes her expression. The entire part could have been portrayed by a life mask made of epoxy, and fitted with slowly batting eye-shadowed lids.

If the woman were in some sense beautiful, this might all have worked, but she isn't beautiful in this movie. If the camera is framing her face, she looks artificial to other-worldly. If it zooms back a little, she looks skinny. If the camera zooms back a little more, she looks ridiculous, because she is so thin, her shoes look way too big. It's worth mentioning that A.J. shows no skin in this movie, probably because she is so emaciated that if she did, the only thing she would arouse would be concern.

Once again, it IS very important to analyze how A.J. looks in this thing, because that's the only thing this movie is about. (Some actresses come out with lines of cosmetics. A.J. should come out with a line of Alkyd enamel.)

No matter how good the actor, each has a default role he can do in his sleep and usually does. Johnny Depp has one - the one in this movie. That's all that need be said about him.

The villains are all Russian - except for the lead villain. He is actually British but LOOKS Russian, and (so it is explained) hangs out with Russians. So why isn't he Russian? Dunno. Have to guess the actor couldn't do the accent. Why are the others Russian? Don't know that one either. Russian villains are clich and so is the movie, so maybe they're just being decorous.

All the Russians are ugly; the American is hapless; all the male Brits but the villain who couldn't do the accent are dashing; Jolie, who was raised in Britain, is supposed to be beautiful, but misses the mark.

There have been some references to the predictable plot twist. I suppose you can call it a twist - albeit one that requires torque wrench. It was still predictable, but only because the movie was so bad that one could not possibly rule it out.

As others have noted, _The Tourist_ could have been done differently in the forties or fifties, with a script built around leads that had personality and chemistry. It would still have been a trifling affair, and a clich, but it would have been entertaining. This movie comes off like _Xanadu_'s attempt at a musical. The idea was there, the concept was straightforward, but the producing, directing, and acting skills to pull it off were lost in the intervening decades.

This attempt is simply incompetent.",1308700800,30,2859,4.525193798449612
4299214,5,B004A8ZWT2,"I absolutely love this movie. It does remind me of the movies from the 50's with its beautiful rich hues and charming musical orchestrations. It has the simplicity of that era, and the visual brilliance of the technicolor of that period that seemed to make fabrics jump off the screen. I found myself hypnotized by the beauty of it all. Plus, there is the wonderful background--Venice, Italy.

Yes, I had read plenty of poor reviews for this movie, and I avoided it when it was in the theater because of the reviews. However, now I wish I had experienced this film on the big screen.

For me, it is a movie I will enjoy over and over again for its stunning visual effects. Angelina's beauty compliments this film (however, I must admit I was a bit uncomfortable with her tiny size). And, while I haven't watched a film with Johnny Depp in a while, I forgot how much I admired his screen presence. For some reviewers, there was no chemistry between Jolie and Depp. I, on the contrary, felt chemistry between them.

And it is difficult not to expect too much from a movie that features two great stars: Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.  I loved the fact that the entire film was done in Italy, Venice to be exact.  Such location adds allure to this movie.  And in this film, Jolie gets to play glamorous woman, the kind that every man wants to please in every possible way.  As Depp states in one moment is she is the ""least down to earth woman he has ever met in his entire life"".  Jolie plays a character that dresses in latest fashion; is hypnotically beautiful and wears her jewelry and sunglasses with such grace and beauty that one cannot take their eyes off of her.

I think that even director of this movie got mesmerized by Angelina.  They even made Depp's character look like a baffoon at times.  She is cool and composed and Depp is nervous, speaks Spanish to Italians and looks like a helpless scardy cat.

I don't like actors being pigeon-holed into roles and I'm glad they made this movie because it was clever and funny and must have been just a cool and not so demanding project for them.  The story is believable, they both acted well, the scenery was to die for.

People also made comments that there was no chemistry between them.  But if you look at the story, Depp's character was supposed to be an awkward, depressed math teacher and Jolie's a sophisticated woman of the world.  It was all part of the weave of the plot that this is so.  It all makes sense in the end.

All in all, it was a great story line and I enjoyed the movie. I plan to watch it again this week.  If I had any say-so, I would have added an extra bit of filmage to show how Johnny Depp's character ended up where he was on vacation - what he went through before getting there - but I would have added that at the very end of the film.

Catching it at home on a second viewing, we discovered its fun, found the chemistry we had been too impatient to concentrate upon and discovered we had a really good time with the film.  We still found the tour of Venice a bit 1960-I SPY-ish, and the direction uneven.  However the stars did shine more brightly than on first viewing and the surrounding players  made it an enjoyable evening.

It seemed to be setting us up for the second at the beginning, then would occasionally lapse into one of the other two, but then never really committed. Depp seemed to be clowning it up at times, ala Pirates of the Caribbean, but nothing previously prepared me for that, so it always felt out of context. Angelina is gorgeous, and is supposed to be a little other-wordly in this, but she was so much so that I couldn't really figure her part out. And the two really didn't seem to have much chemistry at all, which surprised me. That would have been OK if it was a heist type movie that kept you guessing until the end, but I had guessed the end pretty early on, and so had my husband. So it just didn't work overall.

The only thing that saved it somewhat is that Depp and Jolie are both so gorgeous, even in a bad movie. And the Paris/Venice settings were also gorgeous, so there was plenty to look at:-)",1304899200,,1024,4.278350515463917

The story line is great, location in Venice simply breath taking and beautiful as the leading lady.  Scotland Yard, french, gangsters and russian mobsters.  All the good stuff in the old classic movies I grew up watching.  Usually used to seeing Angelina in action films so it was a different pace seeing her as such a lady without punching someone in the face.  Johnny playing an ordinary american on holiday was absolutely sweet and endearing, I wanted to be in the seat next to him.  Of course the end of the film, yes was great.  A fitting end to an uncertain adventure.  Reminding me a little of The Saint with Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue, another fun move with  a lot of the same characters and great ending.",1304294400,,863,4.618421052631579
4299427,4,B004A8ZWT2,"I didn't go into this movie looking for academy award performances and certainly didn't find them. As for a plot that makes sense, I didn't find that either. I've seen plots on SyFy that made better sense. However, I did come away from the experience with a smile on my face, and that's all that matters.

Ms Jolie did an awesome job of looking awesome. She excels at that. In this movie, she reminded me an awful lot of Vanessa Ferlito, or maybe it's the other way around. In any case, it seems she posed more than moved throughout much of the movie. That was okay. She played a good foil for Captain Jack... I mean Johnny Depp. As the schlubby tourist math teacher, he did a pretty decent job. On occasion, however, a bit of his Jack Sparrow slur would leak through in his speech. It wasn't distractive or anything, just a bit of bias I had.

With all that out of the way, the movie started rather slow, with all the foreign detectives tailing her, especially with the annoying subtitles. This is a good time to mention that you must have your picture ratio set properly on the TV or the subtitles will be cut off. In our case, it was just plain annoying to have to keep switching from English to subtitles, back and forth. Luckily, it wasn't all the time, but enough to slow things down, especially during the first half of the movie. One of the big plot holes is where Timothy Dalton tells Paul Bettany to close down the case in the first quarter of the film, which Bettany doesn't, then tells him again at the end of the film. Will he the second time? We will never know, but that is just a small example of the things that do not add up in the plot. There are many more.

It all doesn't matter. The European scenery is fantastic, the Angelina scenery is fantastic, and I guess for the girls, the Johnny scenery is also fantastic. The interplay between the main characters is decent if not a bit underdone. The interplay between the secondary characters, as in the law-enforcement people, is more for comedic effect than really serious. It was a shock to see Paul Bettany playing a good guy for a change. I keep thinking of him in that role in DaVinci code. The final plot twist could be a shocker to some people if you don't look too deep into things, or it could be totally implausible to others.

I am a big fan of foreign films which are usually very similar to a film like this.  A good film is not always a measure of how MUCH is put into it, but sometimes about how LITTLE is put into it.  It kind of like a great meal consisting of small portions versus an average meal consisting of large portions.  Which would you prefer?  Americans tend to prefer the latter.

(1.) Jolie's acting consisted of showcasing her physical attractiveness and little else.
(2.) Depp's acting consisted of his always entertaining, but tiresome for this shallow story, quirky mannerisms.
(3.) Too heavy dependence on Venetian setting and extravagance, etc. to compensate for a disjointed storyline and minimalistic acting.
(4.) Storyline was a disjointed ripoff of segments of similar past movies e.g. accountant steals money from bad guy boss; Russian mafia; hot girlfriend implicitly involved; exotic locations including the usual gondolas; speeding boats and always just-missing gunshots; deceptive getaways that were not very believable; inept cops of various nationalities; extremely unlikely guessing games such as Depp's changed appearance from the original thief now turned into small town math teacher - really not even close to being a logically solvable solution to the story's guessing games.
(5.) Had potential but forgettable. They should have taken a year or two to write a more intelligent and creative story.

There is incredible cinemetography here, an interesting plot that will leave you guessing, and some good action sequences. I rented the movie for the first viewing and after seeing it plan to buy it for repeated viewings. I can't give it five stars though because there are some questions left in my mind in the plot, loose ends that never get tied up, like how Alexander knows Elise will go so far down the train and choose to sit with him instead of any of the guys ahead of him.

I thought the story was interesting, the characters were well-developed, the scenery was beautiful, and the acting was flawless--a very sophisticated thriller.

Then, the story....let's just say that this was one film I actually groaned when the ending ""happened"".  And it's not the pace of the film either.  Slow yes, but I actually like old films with a sweeping story and not the usual Hollywood fare (though I like those as well). It just feels off...

How this film cost $100 million I'll never know.  There are no special effects nor stunts, unless you count Depp jumping onto a fruit cart the death defying stunt of the year.  There's another scene where Jolie drives a boat.  Pulling another boat.  For maybe a couple hundred feet.  Exciting.

-Great tourism video for Venice.  I'd like to visit someday.
-Slow motion boat chase was totally riveting.  Way better than the Bourne movies' chase scenes.

4299493,1,B004A8ZWT2,"The Tourist.

At least it knows what it is in the cinematic world - coming through to take a tour, and then leaving us well alone to be forgotten.

Where to begin. Jolie and Depp are two great actors. Two of the greatest of our time, some would say. They've made incredible films that have touched us, entertained us, and made us cry.

This, without a doubt, isn't one of them.

The Tourist has an utter lack of pacing. Whomever is responsible for the draft of this script needs a serious lesson in rising tension. The plotline holds too many secrets for too long - it's almost the one hour mark (in a 90 minute movie) before anything truly begins to happen. The references as to whats truly happening are so bland and obscure, I had absolutely no care for what happened to the characters. Once Jolie's character was truly revealed, I couldn't help but roll my eyes. When Depp's was revealed, I could have seen it coming from a mile away - although, that's only because I'm used to these films - the actual plot becomes rather broken with this revelation, and makes the entire film nonsensical.

This movie utterly fails to get the viewer to have any emotional investment in either the characters, the plot, or even the concept. Highlights for me were some pretty good scenes of Venice - but if I'm looking at the scenery instead of Jolie, you know we have a problem.

This was also marketed (at least in the trailers that led me to watch this film) as an action / mystery flick. Spys, suave scenes and high society. Plain and simple, this is a lighthearted romantic.. comedy? Drama? Whatever you choose to call it, it was poorly done.

Lastly, I can't believe this is hailed (even by some, the true film critics hated it as well) as 'significant.' I appreciate art films, rom-coms, action, horror - you name it. I'm completely unbiased in what I like - I'll give respect to any genre, if it's done well. This simply isn't a good movie. I can't be honest enough about it.

As a result, he ends up in one of the glamour hotels of Venice, then shot at, incarcerated, tied up, and then rescued in a boat chase.

One of the best action scenes in the movie involves Depp in his pajamas running across the terra cotta roof tiles of Venice.  Then this is followed by one of the funniest scenes in which attempted murder gets placed in its appropriate place between murder and room service.

Jolie is beautiful and compelling, even if her character is a little under-written.  Venice is almost a character in the movie, and if you want eye candy, this movie certainly has it.

4299563,4,B004A8ZWT2,"When my wife said she wanted to watch The Tourist, I actually thought that Owen Steinhauer's  The Tourist , a book I reviewed, was made into a movie.  So I expected a serious movie, full of darkness and intrigue, about a spy acting like a tourist to accomplish his assignments in foreign countries.  This is not that movie.  Instead, it is a romantic comedy involving an actual tourist mistaken as a much sought after thief.

The Tourist is a action adventure romantic tale staring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.  Both Depp and Jolie have performed well in action suspense tales before and the experience shows.  Jolie has appeared in romantic films, and this may be one her better presentations.  In this movie reoccurring bits of humor are excellent, like Depp trying to escape bad guys without shoes, in his pajamas, running across rooftops in Venice.  This film is full of action and intrigue, but much of the action is slightly funny - like bad guys, on foot,  trying to catch a boat in Venice.

Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying Frank, a mild mannered Wisconsin math teacher on vacation in Europe.  His interaction with Jolie, a sophisticated beauty who is obviously at home in the best restaurants and shops, is especially noteworthy.  Depp easily conveniences me that he is nearly a ""Casper milktoast"".  Jolie, who plays the sophisticated Elise, clearly portraits the knowing rich girl who is aware she is constantly being watched but provides an attitude so confident that everyone places her at the center of their attention.

The actions scenes are believable and exciting.  The settings are exquisite, both in the hotels and restaurants, and on the streets of Venice.

My wife and I both enjoyed this film.  I recommend it for a pleasant evening.

What a relief ... to see a movie that isn't just one special effect after another (spectacular explosions, car's crashing all over the place, etc.) but instead,  a plot with mystery and humor ..... no robots or monsters created by a twisted  character wanting to conquer the earth.  Try viewing this one a second time with that in mind.  Relax and enjoy .... not that it doesn't have action ... it does.
  The ever versatile  Johnny Depp portrays yet another type of character, deliberately dull, with flashes of charisma.  Angelina Jolie was fun in this one, outwitting those who were trying to follow her, obviously enjoying the game.  Pay attention to the quiet banter between Depp and Jolie ... it does contribute to the general atmosphere of this movie.
  Fun moments ... a chase across tile rooftops, barefoot and in pyjamas, no less.  A 'rescue', being dragged behind a speedboat, and a somewhat disappointing result for the frumphy ""hero"" to what seemed to be promising in the hotel ....  The villains are nasty characters, of course, what else?

4299900,4,B004A8ZWT2,"The Tourist is gorgeous to look at, and not just the city, and I was really looking forward to seeing to fine actors play it up in an old-fashioned movie, but I was a bit disappointed.  I think it was the director's (Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck)  fault mostly.  Johnny Depp is one of our best actors and he could have played a great bumbling tourist, what we had instead was a hesitant portrayal of a guy who's English accent kept slipping out. I spent most of the movie preoccupied with wondering if Johnny Depp had spent too much time in Europe, to really get into the character.

As for Angelina, always fun to watch and I feel a bit under-appreciated because her beauty is so distracting, she was never given a chance to do anything but wear nice clothes and look good.  Was the director too distracted by Angie's star power to tell her to feel something?  Was there too much press around the shoot for the actors to relax into their characters?

The story line was a gift that was wasted on the director.  I couldn't help imagining how Clint Eastwood would have played up the tension of the situation, how he would have dirtied Angie up a bit and pushed her to a great performance as he had done in the Changeling.  And Johnny Depp, under great direction, could have redefined the whole bumbling tourist thing, as he did with Captain Jack Sparrow.

What I felt was most lacking in the film any sort of intensity.  Compare Angelina in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, where she gives a knife's edge performance. Look at Johnny Depp in anything for the same thing.  I didn't see Depp come alive until the last ten minutes of the film.
Paul Bettany as a Scotland Yard detective is also wasted.  He's another fine actor who could have done so much for his role, yet again, it was like he was ""phoning it in"".

The Tourist is a film that had all the ingredients, it just lacked a great chef.

But the film has in general a predictable, seen-it-before feel (the big surprise ending was obvious 15 minutes in), and talk about mailed-in performances; Depp looks like he wants to be anywhere but with Jolie in most of their scenes. Watch his eyes during their kisses: I'd swear he looks more than a little hammered, as if he had to quaff three or six before going near Jolie. Their chemistry, such as it isn't, is much like the rest of this movie, lackluster at best.

It all looks good on blu-ray, but even Venice sometimes looks a little staged, and you can almost feel all the extras trying not to look at the camera. All the ingredients are here but The Tourist is both half-baked and overdone while trying to be every sort of film and being none very successfully. Except fluff. But even then, Jolie's wooden presence and increasingly alienoid look make everything that much more plastic, and Depp seems to have decided early on in the shoot to just take the money and sleepwalk through.

4300056,4,B004A8ZWT2,"The Tourist is the 2010 English-language debut from director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who previously directed the highly acclaimed German film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-of-Others/dp/B000OVLBGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives of Others</a>. Sporting a cast lead by two of the biggest movie stars in the world, the movie opened to mostly negative reviews and mixed audience reaction. After seeing this movie twice, I think the negativity is somewhat misguided. It's not a great movie, simply a fun piece of mindless entertainment that never takes itself too seriously. Apparently, this movie's light-heartedness and mindlessness is lost on audiences who think every film is meant to be taken seriously unless there's an explosion every few minutes.

Angelina Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, a beautiful woman being followed by the police in Paris as they attempt to apprehend Alexander Pearce, her former lover. Pearce stole two billion dollars from a gangster named Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff) and is wanted by Shaw for this transgression and by the authorities for tax evasion. Elise receives a letter from Alexander that directs her to board a train to Venice and find someone of his height and build to mislead the police. Obliging him, she boards the train and meets Frank (Johnny Depp), an everyman schoolteacher. While the police quickly realize that Frank is not Pearce, mistaken identity puts Shaw on Frank's trail. The movie co-stars Paul Bettany as the lead investigator of the case Inspector John Acheson and former James Bond star Timothy Dalton as Chief Inspector Jones.

While I too have found flaws, there are several things The Tourist does right. Shot in Venice, the locale is beautiful and cinematographer John Seale gives the film a beautiful, elegant look. Of course, discussing this movie and elegance it would be a sin not to mention Jolie who all but seethes elegance the moment she enters the frame. Jolie's performance as Elise has been accused of being ""stiff,"" which is a criticism I highly disagree with. This is not a role that requires her to conjure up great emotional depth. Elise is a glamorous, mysterious woman and Jolie captures that perfectly. While Jolie looks like the glamorous movie star she is, Depp is rugged enough to be convincing as the empathetic everyman and he basically steals every scene he's in. Depp is a quirky, inventive actor who can usually find an interesting character attribute to toy with. As Frank, he's playing a wholly average man who is immediately in awe of Elise and the situation she's dragged him into. Depp is clearly having fun with this role and the way he tackles it makes it immediately fun to watch. His everyman shtick is not without a unique charm that only Depp could provide. His one-word reaction to seeing Jolie at the hotel for example is priceless.

Criticism has also been aimed at the perceived lack of chemistry between Depp and Jolie. How is it possible that two of Hollywood's biggest movie stars could not have chemistry together? Well, I found that they DO but it's not Bogart/Bacall-type chemistry but more of a stilted, awkward one. This is entirely appropriate as Frank is in awe of the fact that a woman like Elise would even talk to him. Towards the end of the film, the two transcend that initial awkwardness and develop a convincing romantic dynamic. It's a cute chemistry that Depp and Jolie share, just not one for the history books.

The Tourist was marketed as an action-comedy and has elements of both, but is more of a throwback to films that give plot a backseat to beautiful movie stars and a beautiful locale. Von Donnersmarck is an acclaimed director whose last film was a pretty heavy drama and it seems obvious that this film was an excuse to go to a beautiful place and have fun. It's obvious that the actors involved had the same intentions. This is not a movie that's meant to be taken seriously and if you watch this movie under the impression that it's Oscar-bait, then a lot of elements would seem poorly executed. If it's not apparent from Depp's performance alone that this is just a fun, light-hearted romp then you need to watch more movies. Even the action/chase/Depp-in-peril sequences are fun and light-hearted, without being too heavy on the suspense.

With all of that in mind, even as the light-hearted romp it is, there are both mild criticisms and serious flaws present in The Tourist. For a film with beautiful cinematography and production design, the score by James Newton Howard, while not bad by any means, is rather typical of a European espionage film. The music just lingers listlessly in the background, rarely making itself noticeable. The biggest flaw here is the final twist; a twist so forced and contrived that it insults the film that came before it and fails on no less than two levels. The first is that it is completely devoid of logic, it makes no sense, and it betrays nearly all the characterization that came before it. If you watch the film aware of the twist, you realize that a particular character is either incredibly stupid, forgetful, or just blissfully unaware of the twist that directly involves him. Few movies have an ending that seem more tacked on than this one. Even worse, the script is co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-winning scribe behind The Usual Suspects. The twist at the end is already unoriginal and something that we've seen many times before but the fact that McQuarrie, in a shameless act of self-plagiarism, was responsible for writing it simply adds insult to injury. This is obviously a major problem, but beyond that I have little to gripe about.

The Tourist is light entertainment that aspires to be nothing more than that. I think everyone involved succeeded at making the film they intended to make and, for what it's worth, they did a commendable job. If not for the twist that insults both the film and the people watching it, it could be much better. There is nothing particularly memorable or fresh about this movie, but it is much more breezy and enjoyable than the critics would have you believe. If you're in a mood where you feel the film Knight & Day will be too taxing on your mental energy, The Tourist is exactly the breezy entertainment you're looking for.

Ultimately, however, the boring dialogue, the predictable ending, the mediocre performance from the two leads, and the jumbled direction/screenplay - is this a thriller, a romance, or a comedy? - turned this into a messy James Bond imitation, with nowhere near the suspense or seductiveness.  There is neither legitimate espionage misdirection nor substantive comedy.

French police are in cooperation with various agencies on the trail of the beautiful Elise Ward (Jolie).  They conspicuously follow her from her home to a local coffee shop where she appears to be dressed for a ball and boringly orders the exact same item in the exact same chair as she always does.  The chase begins after a mysterious note from someone named Alexander Pearce gets hand-delivered to a perpetually blas Elise.  Apparently the snobbish attitude leached aboard the British accent.  Aboard a train she soon meets American math teacher Frank Tupelo (Depp), who proceeds to legitimately bore everyone within a 3-mile radius for the foreseeable future.

The cast roll-call is outstanding, but it says something that nobody could outshine either of the disappointing leads.  Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton play Police Inspectors, the former because he needs the roles and the latter because of subtle one-upmanship.  Steven Berkoff is [insert name of generic bland guy].  Rufus Sewell is namelessly and insignificantly inserted.  Weighed, measured, and found wanting.

So what could possibly be left?  Unlike the movies it portends to imitate, The Tourist is nothing more than the films from which it wishes to separate: CGI and visually dominated films bereft of realistic plot or competent dialogue.  This film is nothing more than beautiful landscapes and the looks of its two stars.  In that regard, Depp often looks disheveled and uninteresting, and Jolie, despite the fact that she's dolled up from into to credits, is not nearly as interesting as all the other characters seem to think she is.

This film serves as nothing more than a Venice tourism promotion and for Angelina Jolie's Google image search hit count.

I gave it two stars because the colors and pictures were stunning - especially of Venice (I also adored Elise's wardrobe).

Both the beginning and the end were intriuging, but for most the movie, it seemed that the script could not make up its' mind. Was it a Bond-esque action thriller or something more suave and slow paced? The result was a ten mile per hour boat chase and a lot of meals and something about a ball. Far from being a thriller, the plot and action was so incredibly boring, I fell asleep. The scenery was beautiful and some of the dialouge was fairly witty, but it was lost in the struggle to pay attention to this movie.

This movie would have been a lot more sucessful if it had decided what it wanted to be. I adore slow-paced thrillers, but this was a snooze-fest.

Johnny, look. I love you, man. But you cannot do what your buddy Nick Cage does, and just take any old movie for the hell of it. Yeah you got to be in Italy for a summer, but was it worth becoming the laughingstock of Hollywood?",1301270400,11,1113,4.315789473684211

The movie was so much more than that! Yes, there are parts that seem slow, but that just gives you a chance to breathe - and perhaps question. It's a REAL movie - not a full adrenaline rush where you can't explain much of the plot later.

Don't get me wrong, the acting was as you'd expect and there are moments of his usual humor shining through but the story is exactly as expected with Jolie's character throwing in the only small, and at the end, almost inconsequential twist. SPOILERS AHEAD As soon as Depp is introduced both my girlfriend and I said that he would end up being Alexander. And surprise, he is. I can live with that, you don't see too many unknown real surprises in movies anymore but the trip is usually the enjoyable part anyway, not where you end up. This is not the case with The Tourist. I was bored, and besides dreaming of our own trip to Venice, so was my girlfriend. And she just sat through what has to be the eighth time she's watched the entire last season of Deadliest Catch... The Tourist isn't worth your time, which is the first time I have EVER said that about any film Depp has been in.

This movie is simple and elegant, which unfortunately is unusual for the 21st century, but I found it to be VERY refreshing.  There is mystery, sex appeal, comedy, romance, drama and action throughout the entire film.  And the storyline is actually BELIEVABLE, something else that the 21st century has abandoned.  I'm a 30yr old woman and I have to say, even I couldn't keep my eyes off Angelina. And what woman could take their eyes off of Johnny?  They were a brilliant combination!

I will say that when I went to see the film, I had other expectations of the movie, based on what I saw on the trailers but I was pleasantly surprise to find out my expectations were misplaced.  That alone made the experience of the movie much more pleasurable.  I didn't know everything that was going to happen because the trailers had all the good parts of the movie in it, like just about every other movie I have seen.  I rarely go to the movies because I don't feel like paying $30 to eat popcorn and sit with strangers who may or may not talk through the movie and cant pause it if I have to go to the bathroom, when I can easily wait a few months and spend $5 to rent it.  I go for movies that I think would be better in a theatre.  This is not a movie that I would have needed to see in a theatre, HOWEVER, I am very glad that I did.

4300327,4,B004A8ZWT2,"THE TOURIST has many flaws, not the least of which is the fact that it doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind whether it is a suspense thriller, a romantic comedy, or a travelogue.  But despite all of its weaknesses, on the small screen in the home it comes across as an Italian delicacy well worth watching. Bouncing around from Paris to Scotland Yard and eventually to serenissima Venice the visuals (thanks to cinematographer John Seale's ability to capture the flavors of Venice so beautifully) steal the show. The story written by none other than Julian Fellowes ('Gosford Park', 'Separate Lies',  'Young Victoria', 'Vanity Fair', 'From Time to Time') with director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, Christopher McQuarrie, and J&eacute;rme Salle (whose 2005 French thriller 'Anthony Zimmer' spawned this American version) is quirky by entertaining, and the musical score by James Newton Howard adds distinction to the film.

Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie, dressed to the nines and looking like a mannequin) is on a mission: she is being closely followed on secret video by Scotland Yard Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) and Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) who expect her to meet up with one Alexander Pearce and gain back the money stolen from crime lord Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff). She eludes capture and boards a train to Venice where her instructions from Pearce suggest that she meet a man who looks like Pearce.  Interpol is engaged and the Italian police - led by Sergente Cerato (the extraordinarily handsome Alessio Boni) et al - pickup the chase for Scotland yard.  On the train Elise meets American spy-fiction fan and math teacher Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) and manipulates his emotions and attention to the point that Frank follows Elise to Venice - and the mystery thickens. Amid interesting characters are 'The Englishman' (Rufus Sewell) and Conte Filippo Gaggia (the ultimate Italian leading man Raoul Bova, remembered for his important role in 'Under the Tuscan Sun') who add to the suspense and incidents of mistaken identity.  To say anything further would rob the viewer of what little suspense the script contains.

The very fine cast seems to be sleepwalking through much of the story, but they are still so terrific to watch that they make the film a fine evening's entertainment.  Probably this film is better on DVD than it was one the big screen in theaters: the story seems more intimate and the relationships more credible.

Donnersmarck has really a sense of style.

The storyline itself is fun and don't consider this film a thriller, but rather an entertaining flick with a touch of comedy in the style of films from the 60s, like e.g. comparable to films with e.g. Peter Sellers or similar. And sure in a real thriller the storyline could have been fleshed out a bit, but ""The Tourist"" is just not this kind of movie. Also the soundtrack overall is actually very good.

Place most of the scenes in Paris and Venice. Add a twist or two. This should be a thrilling movie, but it's not.

""The Tourist"" opens with Angelina's character under surveillance in Paris. A mysterious man, Alexander Pearce, is wanted by numerous agencies and criminals for having stolen billions of dollars and disappeared. Angelina is his girlfriend, and everyone assumes she is the best way to find him again. She receives a hand-delivered note from Mr. Pearce telling her to get on the next train to Venice, and to befriend and travel with a man that looks like Pearce--to distract and deceive the authorities, we assume.

She does as she is told, picking out Depp's character, who is a math teacher and widower from Wisconsin. Soon, he is caught up in the intrigue, since many now believe he is Pearce. This is further confirmed by Angelina's budding love for him and her impetuous decision to give him a kiss in full view of those keeping her under surveillance. Yes, eventually, we get a few chase scenes, a few twists, and some humorous bits of dialogue. But this movie plods along on poor writing, with every gangster being cut from cardboard, every intelligence officer lacking intelligence, and even the hints at chemistry between Depp and Jolie stifled by a plot that is surprisingly thin for such a grand international thriller.

""The Tourist"" is more of a romantic comedy, but there's not really any romance. In fact, it's not even very funny. There are a few short comic clips, but not once did I let out more than a subtle chuckle.

I actually laughed a lot during the preview and thought ""this movie is gonna be awesome"", but it was a major let down. The roles were well acted, and Depp, Jolie and Bettany are awesome as always, but the story line just isn't there.

The story here may seem pat on the surface, and upon it's initial viewing the ending may come out of left field for some. But be sure to pay attention because everything does add up. By design you will not be able to fully appreciate Elise (Angelina Jolie) and Frank's (Johnny Depp) romantic relationship, which is a major part of the film, the first go around. It's in that narrative hurdle that many will be turned off by the film or worse, dismiss it all together once it ends, but like I said, a second viewing will certainly clear things up and even make it much more enjoyable. The chemistry between Jolie and Depp is, much like the film, light as a feather. This is something that can also be counted as a detractor but I thought it worked quite well. Films of this style need a breezy air about them and Jolie and Depp easily bring that to the table. In the end ""The Tourist"" is misunderstood and underrated. I think many contemporary film goers just aren't familiar with 1950s European romantic mysteries like ""To Catch a Thief"" making it nearly impossible for them to properly gage ""The Tourist.""

4300461,2,B004A8ZWT2,"A few disclaimers:
1. SPOILER ALERT--this review includes spoilers, especially the most important one that the plot revolves around.
2. I don't care for action movies, especially the ones that are strictly for the sake of blowing things up to sell tickets, etc.--mindless action movies with little plot, in other words. So the lack of that, or sex, or profanity, is not why I didn't like this film. It's fine if a well-done, quality film has contextual action in it, though.
3. I adore Johnny Depp and think he's the greatest actor around today, or ever, actually. He was born to act. I loved him in this movie--yes, I'm also somewhat biased when it comes to him, I admit--but I'm totally objective when it comes to his movies. There are a few I don't like at all, some that are good or just OK, and some I dearly love. But this movie isn't one of those, unfortunately:
I give it a 5/10. When I first heard Johnny was going to do this, I had two immediate reactions: 1) YAY, he's finally doing a movie with AJ--who I firmly believe is his female counterpart in the looks department. And 2) This movie doesn't seem like his usual style, and it seems kinda....beneath him.
So I was curious to see if it would stand out above the usual formula chase 'em/plot twists and turns/who's really the criminal and who's not suspense thriller genre flicks, of which To Catch a Thief seems to be the standard by which all the subsequent ones go by, and of which some are awful and some--like North By Northwest--are great.
This was lacking in atmosphere, continuity, dialogue, plot...I could go on. It was way too slow and draggy in places, and the lack of ANY sizzling or even halfway interesting dialogue between Johnny and AJ truly astounded me, except for the very end, which seemed to be a very clever and funny 'inside joke' that probably only the Depp fans who right-click-save their fingers off to try to capture and own every picture of him they possibly can off the internet, because of his true beauty, would understand.
I was disappointed after seeing this movie--the plot was contrived and skewed, like the confusing train scene, for one example---DID she know or just suspect (or neither) that he was Alexander, or had they had that set up from before so that it was only the audience that was fooled? Because something she said then led me to believe that she did know--when she said she didn't like the name Frank, and that they would find him another. That could've been code to him for 'Why would you pick THAT horrid name?' in case any of Shaw's thugs or the police could hear them talking or had their booth bugged. But whether she knew it then or not is something the audience will never know, since it wasn't ever explained or answered in the movie.
Some of it was blatantly contrived, like when she showed up from out of nowhere in the canal in the middle of the night to rescue him--like the knight in shining armor on a white horse. The question that immediately came to mind was 'How did she know he was there, in danger?' Unless she'd been watching him from the moment he was taken to jail earlier that day, which was unlikely.
Paul Bettany did his usual stellar job, even though his part was less meaty than Johnny's or AJ's was. And the scenery was authentic, which is a nice change from CGI and green screen, etc., and gorgeous, like it's male lead.
This movie was akin to going into a banquet room expecting a feast, and coming back out 2 hours later still hungry. I'm still wondering why Johnny did this movie, and also wondering if the low quality and dialogue was what all the laughing was about that the cast did during the making of it, because some of the corniness in it actually embarrassed me.
But of course, die-hard Depp fans like me will have to own the DVD.",1300492800,,3788,4.507267441860465

I figured that The Tourist was going to be 2 hours of my life that I would never be able to get back, like the time I wasted watching Ishtar and more recently The American.  I played it on the TV for the missus (She had seen the adverts and adores Angelina Jolie, as do I frankly, and Johnny Depp) This made her insist I get a copy to play.  So with the laptop out and a peripheral view of my big screen I found myself strangely pulled into the story.  Within the first 20 minutes my laptop wasn't only being ignored but it was turned off and put away so I could give The Tourist my full attention.  It, as others had said, is in a classic thriller style which I thoroughly enjoy and the story wasn't half bad either.  I am an avid movie buff, plus I indulge in the genre of action/adventure i.e. popcorn munchers starring ""great"" actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Chuck Norris, etc. from directors/producers like Micheal Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer.  Who says that explosions, no plot and T&A are a bad thing.  Sometimes I enjoy watching 90-120 of film with my brain mostly disengaged.

So after all of the pans that this title had gotten I was expecting nothing, but instead got a surprisingly entertaining night of entertainment.  The Blu-ray transfer was excellent.  The video was crisp with vibrant colors and  I did not notice banding or compression artifacts whilst watching The Tourist.  The Soundtrack (DTS-MA in my case) was excellent.

4300496,2,B004A8ZWT2,"""The Tourist,"" a Hollywood remake of a 2005 French film ""Anthony Zimmer,"" is not just a thriller. With Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp both top-billed, ""The Tourist"" also wants to be a romance, and even a comedy, too. Whatever the film may be, one thing is certain. ""The Tourist"" is a beautiful film to look at, but not much else beyond its surface.

Johnny Depp is an American tourist Frank Tupelo, a math teacher on board the train heading to Venice. A beautiful, femme fatale-like woman Elise approaches to him and apparently Elise has been followed by men in suit. With two talented players and a beautiful Venice backdrop, ""The Tourist"" could have been a hugely entertaining suspense (or romantic / comedy suspense). Sadly, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, director of Oscar-winning ""The Lives of Others,"" seems not to know what he is making at all.

Some may say people shouldn't take ""The Tourist"" too seriously. We know we shouldn't. The film was inexplicably nominated for three Golden Globes including Best Picture: Musical or Comedy category. Certainly it is mildly amusing watching Johnny Depp in pajama trotting on the rooftop, but the joke wears out its welcome really fast as the lengthy scene goes on and on.

Who is ""Alexander Pearce"" and what did he do? Why a gangster Shaw (Steven Berkoff, wasted) is after him?

4300500,4,B004A8ZWT2,"Overview:

This PG-13, 103 minute movie can be considered to be a Drama/Action Film with a sprinkling of comedy. The film centers mainly on Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie). She is being watched and trailed  in Paris by French police working with Scotland Yard. However, a certain mobster also has a keen interest in her, because her male companion, an investment banker, has stolen a vast sum of money from him.

Plot:

Elise receives a mysterious letter from the very illusive Alexander Pearce, a former lover, with explicit directions to board a train to Venice, Italy. The curious thing about this is that no-one knows exactly what Mr. Pearce looks like. The plan is for Elise to find a stooge or decoy on the train, that everyone will take for Mr. Pearce. That's where Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) comes into the picture.

Venice:

This city was a wonderful selection for this movie. It stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. Because of its unique characteristics, it yields itself to some very interesting in city boat chases.

Conclusion:

Nowadays where movies are laced with tons of CG to make the impossible appear to be able to happen, it is quite refreshing to see a film where the onus is instead placed upon the actors themselves as well as the atmosphere of the locations. This gives this film a genuine feel of intrigue that has not been artificially embellished by the magic of computers.

Some may say that this film is `boring' because of this, but I think that it allows the film to come across in a more sincere manner, and it feels like a breath of fresh air.",1298678400,8,1651,4.724738675958188
4300501,3,B004A8ZWT2,"Sadly the Tourist was really nothing special at all. When you put these two huge names such as Depp and Jolie on a film together though, people will want to see it regardless. I'll admit I did. Beginning and remaining quite dull and predictable throughout, I found myself bored shortly into the film. Within 25 minutes or so I could tell that this movie was not what I had expected. Sometimes I do that, expect too much and become unhappy that it did not provide me with enough satisfaction from it. So I'd say go into this not expecting much, you'll enjoy much more that way. There was rarely any sign of action or suspense in the film providing maybe one or two ""exciting"" scenes where there was more than just dialogue between characters. The only actual treat watching this film comes from seeing these two beautiful people on the screen of their first movie together. I will not spoil the film for you as many would, just merely explaining my thoughts of it. If you read too much into my opinion and think I'm saying the movie is horrific then just stop reading my review on it and read somene elses. My problem was that with all the potential on the set and from the two actors, we got a very unitelligent, unsuspenseful, and quite predictable, dull adventure moview. If this film had any other two actors in it there would be no hype about it nor an odd nomination at the globes for 2010's best picture. The Tourist was somewhat interesting but overall the movie was nothing special and I would not he hurt if I don't watch this one again. I would advice a rent for this if you must see but don't recommend a blind buy. There really is not too much in this movie, it's just Depp and Jolie together in a film for the first time. I do hope maybe the next one will be a bit more exciting with them two in it.

4300502,3,B004A8ZWT2,"Normally I only like Johnny Depp when he's a pirate (this includes Chocolat where he was considered a ""river pirate""), but I really enjoyed him in this movie. After playing a long list of confident and quirky characters, it was endearing to see him as a normal bumbling guy who doesn't say the right thing or have a funny quip to offer. His awkwardness and the fact that he was completely unsure of what to do in every situation really lightened up what would have just been just another random action flick.

I love Angelina Jolie. I think she's an incredible actress and just absolutely stunning. However, I couldn't get on board (ha ha, boat humor) with her character. I think it's because I'm so used to her kickin' ass and in this movie she's under some rich guy's thumb and seemed so helpless at times. I kept waiting for her to take down all the police guys and start throwing knives at the gangsters. No, all she did in this movie was walk around a lot. But, she did have some great outfits. Very sophisticated, sleek lines, and neutral tones. I think it worked well for the movie and put more focus on her face; any bright colors or patterns would have been distracting.

I went into the movie with rather low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Though I don't think it was meant to be a particularly funny movie, I found myself laughing almost through the entire film. There were also some really beautiful scenes of Venetian landscape.

This was a really good movie, and I think the only thing keeping it from being great was the lack of depth in Elise's character. She should have been more sad about her situation with Pearce, how she loved him so much but couldn't be with him, and more torn about what she was doing to Frank. She just seemed to be pensive all the time. Just, ""Gee, this is kind of a pickle I'm in... but damn, I look good.""

4300565,5,B004A8ZWT2,"Don't expect a deep moral, ethical, political or religious meaning in this film. It is not an author's film , as they say in Paris. It is first of all a remake of the eternal Arsne Lupin or Rouletabille to remain French, or simpler Robin Hood to turn English, or William Wallace to lean towards Scotland. And definitely I am fascinated by these thieves who steal the money of the very rich for their own sake, with a few crumbs to the poorest. And here the very rich are Russian, making fortunes in casinos and brothels, so it is just right to steal billions of decent currencies from them, though it is bad to forget paying one's income tax to the British Treasury.

The film is simple but effective. We kind of know from the very start who Alexander Pierce may be, but that's not important at all because what is essential is how that thief who nicely put several billions of some good currencies in his pocket directly from the coffers of a Russian Mafioso, will evade the police and escape from the real Russian gangsters.

There is no depth in all that but there is a lot of fun and action. It is also so realistically critical of the world's polices that it turns funny somewhere. The English police are only interested in recuperating the income tax that was not paid. The French police are whipping other cats, as they say in French, and looking the other way. The Italian police are only attracted by the profit they can make out of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder. Only Interpol, or a couple of Interpol agents are honest, though some might already be too high a count. Only one in fact and as long as the game is funny and paid for by his authorities.

The most difficult part is to convince the girlfriend that she is just doing what she has to do, according to the letters he has delivered to her regularly when there is a bend or turn along the way. Ha has spent one million dollars having his own face restructured somewhere in Brazil, or Latin America, and she does not know what he looks like any more. She is an Interpol agent and he can count on her being able to resist anything including violence and her being very creative in her actions. And she does not disappoint us, and probably not our Alexander Pierce.

While she is going from one station to the next according to his instructions, he is getting close to her and observing her and getting the protection she can get from Interpol who are protecting and following her, just like a pack of dogs would follow the smell of a fox. In fact the scent is that of a vixen in this case since Interpol, or the Russian gangster do not know the scent of the fox since he has spent a fortune to change his physical parameters.

And everyone will be happy. The Russian Mafiosi will be all dead, as dead as a bunch of door nails, though not enough nails to nail down their coffins. The British cops will recuperate the 744 million pounds of overdue tax money they wanted to get out of the business. The beautiful Elise will be reunited to her mysterious Alexander Pierce. Alexander Pierce will be able to sail away with no one on his tracks any more.

That's a pure action film done in the best immoral tradition of the morality one can find in robbing the rich. It is their fault any way. They would not be robbed if they were not rich. Let them give everything away and follow Jesus on his way to Capharnam or Jerusalem. Unluckily today's rich people are not like the tax collector Matthew. They don't believe in giving their money away and they prefer losing their lives rather than not retaliating against some one who borrowed a few billions from their coffers with the intention of not bringing them back. There is a Zorro in the heart of every good citizen.

On the other hand, von Donnersmarck in only his second directorial effort displays a far more literal style that is anything but frothy, and sadly seems at odds with the souffl touch this film badly needs to make it true escapist fare. He co-wrote the twisty, preposterous screenplay with two masters of the mystery genre, Christopher McQuarrie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00005V9HH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>) and Julian Fellowes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gosford-Park/dp/B00005JKNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gosford Park</a>), and the film boasts the requisite star power with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.

But something just doesn't feel right about the whole venture, and it may be a case of too many cooks in the kitchen waiting for their paychecks. Looking every inch the glamorous movie star, Jolie plays a mystery woman named Elise Ward who is being trailed by the French police working in cahoots with Scotland Yard. She receives a note from her former lover Alexander Pearce at a sidewalk caf instructing her to take a train to Venice, find a stranger that looks just like him, and convince the police that the stranger is Pearce. Elise finds Pearce's doppelganger-to-be in Frank Tupelo, a meek math teacher from Wisconsin, and the chase begins in earnest as Elise reveals to Frank that Pearce stole two billion dollars from a surly gangster and is wanted for tax evasion by the police. The film feels like a series of heavily orchestrated set pieces meant to dazzle but only succeed in sputtering into incredulity, especially a sluggish boat chase in Venice's Grand Canal, the water of which looks ridiculously pristine. The ending is basically on par with Pam finding Bobby in the shower at the end of Season 8 of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dallas/dp/B000YGGNIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dallas</a>&nbsp;and just as convincing.

Dressed to the nines by Colleen Atwood and immaculately made up, Jolie looks stunning and acts as best she can like she is the star of one of Donen's movies, but Depp is strangely at sea in his Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart everyman role. Without a layer of makeup and his standard set of eccentricities, the actor flounders in an oddly blank-faced manner that makes Elise's attraction to Frank all the more puzzling despite his blind acts of puppy-dog devotion. A strong supporting cast has been assembled but given little to do beyond looking exasperated or confused - Paul Bettany as an inspector obsessed with capturing Pearce, Timothy Dalton as the chief inspector, Steven Berkoff as the merciless gangster, and Rufus Sewell as the mysterious stranger the police try to trail. Venice looks as inviting as it did in David Lean's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summertime/dp/6305094934/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summertime</a>&nbsp;through John Seale's lens, especially the glorious Hotel Danieli where Frank and Elise steal a kiss that sets the police after him.

THE TOURIST is an absolute parody of today's quintessential spy thriller, and the brilliance is that I went into this film thinking it was a drama and realizing by increments that it was the absolute opposite.

20 minutes in I began to realize that one can look at it two ways: it could be an awful, awful attempt at a dramatic thriller with awkward lines and over-utilization of it's eye candy main leads. The look of the film, with plenty of Venice and Paris in the mix, is gorgeous - but Angelina Jolie is used almost as a setting in herself with so many long pauses for the audience to presumably savor the look of her. And the plot line, swooping music and script itself is stale and recycled.

Or those awkward lines, pauses on Angelina, and god-awful Russian gangsters are something else: absolutely hilarious. THE TOURIST, whether or not it aimed to be so funny, succeeds in being a top-notch parody of traditional thrillers. By the end, the bizarre twists and humor had reached such a peak that I was practically crying from laughing!

The movie is a throw back to the romantic adventures of the 50s. I believe it is a remake of an older film. I enjoyed it in a similar fashion to The Thomas Crown Affair, which is also a remake of an older film.

Some critics have complained that Jolie appeared a bit stiff in this role. I disagree. She was larger than life in elegance and sexiness, and that's the whole point in making the movie. Some people just don't get it. I can guarantee that most men won't be taking their eyes off her even when other characters enter the scene.

Jolie plays a British goverment agent who's in love with the major league criminal that everyone else is looking for.

[As an aside] Jolie's character's name is Elise Clifton-Ward. This is an inescapable reference to the character, Penelope Creighton-Ward, who was also a British secret agent in The Thunderbirds TV series from the 1960s.

Americans won't know much about The Thunderbirds, but Brits, Australians and probably some others know Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward from this hugely successful kids TV adventure series that we all grew up loving. Penelope (and all the other charcters) were played by wooden marionettes.

This may explain why Jolie sometimes appears a little wooden.

So I would personally like to thank Angelina, her make-up and costume artists, and all the makers of this film for bringing this daring and beautiful secret service agent truly to life. She was stunning.

Go and see this movie and treat yourself to a fun night out.",1294185600,138,2035,4.742209631728045
4300570,4,B004A8ZWT2,"The Tourist sets out to be a romantic mystery in the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock.  Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp may not be 21st century versions of Grace Kelly and Cary Grant but a Jolie comes close being an ice princess. She is so impeccably dressed and poised that she deflects all emotion.

Spoilers below.

For me Angelina Jolie's character needed more of a past. We need to know to know that she has crossed the line from a Scotland Yard agent to compromising herself with Alexander Pierce.  Perhaps Inspector Acheson (Paul Bettany) should pick her up for questioning early in the film instead of Jolie walking into a police office to report after a year of saying nothing.

Scotland Yard is motivated to capture Pierce because he owes the British government several million in taxes.  Since Pierce has stolen a huge amount a money from a crime boss one wonders where the taxes are coming from.  Pierce's character does not seem to warrant so much attention from the police. Maybe if he was also selling government secrets or had something that both the British government and the crime boss wanted there would be a more plausible reason for all the international fuss about capturing Pierce.

There also is the problem that Jolie is not supposed to recognize Depp's Frank Tupelo as Pierce yet be drawn to him at the same time.  The lack of recognition places some distance between the characters at the conclusion when Jolie and Depp go off together it all seems abrupt. Unfortunately, Rufus Sewell doesn't get enough screen time as the phony Pierce to convince us that he might be the man everyone is searching for.

End Spoilers

The Tourist has good performances by Paul Bettany, Jolie and Depp, but their performances were more on the average side than exceptional.  Steven Berkoff made a demented villain but I had some trouble taking him seriously.  For me, the backdrop of Paris and Venice gave the film its appeal.  Having Johnny Depp running across the rooftops of Venice in pajamas made the chase far more interesting.  The Tourist is interesting to watch, especially if you have an affection of Paris or Venice, but the story could have been thought out.",1294099200,3,2175,4.793565683646112
4300571,5,B004A8ZWT2,"The director's first film was an academy award winning, deep tense emotionally fraught political drama.  Maybe critics were upset when the director changed tacks this time around and decided to make a more accessible entertainment, in the Hitchcockian vein. Regardless of the bad reviews critics gave this movie, I think the director succeeds admirably at his objective.  I was entertained throughout, Depp and Jolie are solid, and the cinematography is spellbinding.",1293926400,71,467,5.563380281690141

And I loved the ending EXCEPT I couldn't help but wonder if Hollywood didn't have the last laugh by leaving the door open for sequel(s).  I don't know about the rest of you, but I like a film that finishes definitively and I LOVE a sequel that picks up on that and continues the story.  As you might imagine, I'm not so positive about the opposite.

And I'd like to know how YOU feel:

a) Great film vs not so great?

b) Sequel too obvious or not?

c) Do we all want to marry Johnny Depp????",1293408000,4,646,4.237704918032787

I love the nuances of the relationship between Elise and Frank, the plot twists, and the elegance of it all. Frank vs. first love, Alexander, is a delight to watch unfold. Johnny Depp's performances are always wonderfully nuanced, and the humor underplaying his romance with Elise is fun to watch. The bits about an American who doesn't speak Italian but instead speaks Spanish in Venice tickle my funny bone every time. I have never met a cool math teacher from Wisconsin like Frank--not sure they exist!--but I must say I was glad Frank did not have a ""Scansin"" speech pattern and accent. That would have been totally unromantic... :-)

Bottom line--if you like subtle (or not so subtle) humor, with a nice romance and a love for a chase or two, not to mention Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, try this!",1523404800,,890,4.632911392405063
