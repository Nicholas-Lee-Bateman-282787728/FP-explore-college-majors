8042555,2,B0006QAIE6,I've always found Image Entertainment to be good value until now. Non-anamorphic presentation of widescreen? Never thought it possible from Image. Now I know better.  Pity. BTW - There are probably more deaf people than Spanish people in the USA so why provide Spanish subtitles but ignore the hearing impaired? Especially those who went deaf through ear damage while fighting for their country!,1490486400,,395,5.26984126984127
8042556,4,B0006QAIE6,The movie was very informative and entertaining and I would purchase it again. I learned a lot about black cowboys in the west.,1384473600,,127,4.565217391304348
8042557,2,B0006QAIE6,"If you don't know, cutting is a great sport and a good cutting horse is a true athlete and as smart as they come.  So with a title like this movie has, you'd expect to really see some good horsemanship.  Unfortunately, there isn't much here.  This is a B-rated movie that I would have been happy with if it showed some good cutting and lived up to its title.  It didn't.  There's very little actual cutting, very little about cutting, and on the whole it was a big disappointment.  If you must see this, rent it, don't buy it.  You won't be watching it twice.",1266278400,,559,4.266666666666667
8042558,2,B0006QAIE6,"Beautiful scenery, Beautiful horses, however acting was very poor. It was all around acting at it's worst.",1238544000,,106,5.294117647058823
8042559,2,B0006QAIE6,This movie is very pretty to look at.  It shows California landscape at its best.  Trying watching this film with the sound turned off.,1145491200,,135,4.583333333333333
8042560,1,B0006QAIE6,"This was possibly the worst film I've ever had to sit through. The plot was ridiculous, the acting was terrible; the horses were the only things worth seeing. The editing was so bad, it made the cutting scenes not even worth watching. Do not waste your hard-earned money on this one unless you have people you don't like over for dinner.",1129420800,2,337,4.540983606557377
8042561,4,B0006QAIE6,"Cutting Horse film is filled with beauty.  Beautiful landscape, gorgeous horses and very well shot.  I don't know how many people like me sat through the Big budget, overpayed actor filled film The Alamo.  Now that film to me was torture, because I expected ""something"" that wasn't delivered.  If you're looking for a fast-paced MTV-generation Western, then you need to buy a Hollywood movie like The Alamo.  But if you like old spaghetti Westerns about ""Real character"" set in beautiful landscapes then this is your film.",1112572800,4,522,5.023255813953488
8042562,2,B0006QAIE6,"The only decent actors in this movie were those of the equine variety.  Sitting through this movie was like a session of Chinese water torture -- I was just too embarassed for the actors, and disgusted by the generally disjointed film sequences.  If you can tolerate choppy and unenthusiastic acting, incredibly lame sound effects, and lingering scenes that have absolutely no significance in the overall scheme of things, then by all means, buy this movie.",1112486400,,457,5.08
