8713880,5,B00WQDAJ6Y,"Initially I was a bit hesitant about ordering this collector's set as I already own the 4 Film boxset and the price was a bit high. After have the item in my basket for quite some time I noticed the price had decreased and finally decided to take the plunge and make the purchase.

The item was well packaged and arrived safely with no damage, unlike two of my other parcels ordered on amazon I had received in the past. On opening the box the noticed the standard packaging, with the safety plastic to keep everything in place while in transit. Although a little smaller than I thought, the egg has a total height of +/-24.5cm (9.65inches).

The Blu-Ray discs are securely stored in the base in a nice booklet type case, and the artwork looks really amazing. The egg also lights up really nicely and uses 2x AA/LR6 1.5v batteries (included).

All-in-all this is a really awesome boxset and I would highly recommend it to any avid Aliens Fan / Collector.

I have made an unboxing video which you can view here:https://youtu.be/azobUBOTA4o",1450483200,,1038,4.655737704918033
