5859607,1,B00DVD5SBE,"Supposed to be a quirky glimpse at a young adult in flux, right? Well, maybe it would have been more satisfying if we had more of a glimpse into her downward spiral. The main character's impetus for leaving New York is woefully underdeveloped (not to mention a transparently idiotic metaphor), but then she goes ahead and basks in some outright pedophilia. No, it's not okay for genders to be reversed. Plus, the main character has this experience but has no problem going back into the ""real world,"" which is not something that would ever happen in real life. A seriously stupid, misguided view of a privileged girl who whines that she can't get what she wants so she runs back to her parents. Stupid and lifeless.

5859611,3,B00DVD5SBE,"""Things happen, keep moving or die."" Leigh (Bell) is a reporter working for a paper in New York. After writing an article she is passionate about she quits when it won't get published and ends up moving back home. While she is trying to make sense of her life she gets a job as a lifeguard and reconnects with her parents and her old friends. Leigh learns the meaning of 'you can't go home again'. There is a saying you can't judge a book by its cover, after watching this one it should also be applied to movies. Going off the cover I expected a nice light comedy with Kristin Bell playing her usual character. I got the exact opposite. The movie is a heavy drama with very real issues. After moving home she finds that her friends are not who they once were and neither are her parents. She begins a romance with an underage boy at the place where she works which has repercussions for everyone. This is nothing like I expected but I did really like it much more then I expected. Overall, a different movie and role for Bell but it works. Depressing but good. I say B+.",1375488000,26,1071,4.306930693069307

5859615,5,B00DVD5SBE,"I've got no experience with Veronica Mars, but I can see why people like Kristen Bell.  She's real and relatable, as are all of the characters in this film.

At age 29, with her life in the city more disheartening and less complete than she ever expected, Kristen Bell's Leigh heads back home, where her two best friends (Mammie Gummer of The Good Wife and the familiar Martin Starr of Freaks and Geeks and about a million other comedies) are leading lives equally unperfected.  During her aimless summer in her home town, she crosses paths with the local drop-outs, played sensitively and convincingly by a trio of young actors, including recently discovered teen actor Alex Shaffer of the Paul Giamatti film Win, Win, in a supporting role.  Youthful indiscretions can't really cohabit with adult responsibilities, and the dramatic tension is ratcheted-up (if also resolved fairly easily) in sincere ways.

Nice production and a convincing story of early middle-age indecision with nuanced acting by a strong cast of recognizable faces adds up to a satisfying film.",1375142400,34,1066,5.0685714285714285

5859645,4,B00DVD5SBE,"Leigh (Kristen Bell) is a 29 year old journalist who has lost her taste for the dog-eat-dog world of journalism.  After writing a story about a tiger that died in the squalid conditions of captivity by a private owner, Leigh goes into reflection about her own life.  She feels that she is something of  a captive of her life.  She writes a piece on the tiger that is flippantly dismissed by her editor.  That is the last straw.

With her life being complicated, she seeks to return to her carefree teenage years.  As such, she moves back in with her parents and picks up a job that a teenager would be likely to get as a 1st job:  she becomes the lifeguard @ her hometown's public pool.  Surely, this will make things simple again.  Or will it?  In her quest to return to being a teenager, she has an inappropriate relationship with a 16yr old boy (uh oh!).  She knows better....but she can't help herself.

Symbolism regarding the trapped tiger re-emerge throughout the movie.  A teenager who is an acquaintance is dying to get out of the small town & move elsewhere.  In his own way, he resembles the trapped tiger.  When Leigh's affair with a juvenile is uncovered, she begins to worry that she might be in a form of captivity herself, known as a woman's prison.

This is a thoughtful movie about the transition from our high school years to becoming an adult.  Some of us get a head start while others of us never make it.  Kristen Bell is a lovely young woman, but her beauty is dumbed down for this role;  little to no makeup and a plain hairstyle.  She portrays the girl-next-door who tried to fly out of the next but who ended up not making it....@ least the 1st time.  I found this to be a nostalgic film that explores a very sensitive topic:  statutory relations in the opposite direction that we normally think of them.",1471219200,2,1830,4.445783132530121

5859652,3,B00DVD5SBE,"This review is not for the movie, which I feel is weak in all ways, other than the fact that I love looking at Kristen Bell. How this was a Sundance Festival selection is FAR beyond me.  Ok, there was a bit of a movie critique.  Anyway, the REST of this review is for the quality and value of the blu-ray ONLY, as I already owned this on DVD.

Opening this blu-ray, the outer artwork is nice, but the disc was plain-looking-- and is the first blu-ray out of several hundred that I own without the famous blu-ray logo on it. It instead says ""Blu-ray"" in words. Unlike the DVD, there is no picture of Kristen Bell or any artwork on the label. Just some verbiage.

The underside of the blu-ray disc was a negative surprise in that it is not ""burned"" to the edges, but it stops about 1/4"" from the edge.  Like someone had recorded this at home, and NOT used all of the disc to give its contents the most possible quality, seen in Mbps when viewing the film.

As to the picture/sound quality, the picture is of nice high-definition quality on my 55"" HD TV, sharper than the DVD and identical to Amazon Instant Video's HD version.  Very nice and sharp; not amazing, but a solid HD job.  However, the darned chapters are-- get ready-- every 10 minutes exactly!  Just like you might record at home.  NOT like the DVD, on which the chapters start where they should, at the beginning of scenes.  Horrible!  And, on the menu, there are no names for the scenes, just chapter 1, chapter 2, etc.  Yikes!

Then, there are NO extras at all except for English subtitles if you wish to see them.  There is NO documentary about the making of the film, no director commentary, and no deleted scenes (the latter two items are on the DVD).  Heck, there are not even any trailers!

Overall, this blu-ray seems lke the FIRST effort ever by the place that mastered and manufactured it.  Embarrassing.  Thankfully, the picture is good HD and the sound is good.  Otherwise, this is an El Cheapo job.

Don't thumb me down for honesty and ACCURACY, please.  I'm trying to help future purchasers with a balanced, honest review.",1447459200,7,2097,4.448818897637795
5859653,4,B00DVD5SBE,"This film, with its sexy cover for purposes of marketing, immediately surprises with its intelligence and depth.  The protagonist has hit a rough spot for the first time in her life:  New York and what she has achieved as a journalist are disillusioning, as is her truncated relationship with a man already taken.  So she decides to chuck it all and return home to get herself back together.  Upon moving back in with her parents and getting a job as a lifeguard, she reconnects with old friends and meets some local bad boys about to drop out of high school.

Emerging from a depression, almost an early mid-life crisis, you see flashes of how smart and tough she is, as when she confronts 2 cops who are harassing the students she has befriended.  You also see how she was spoiled as a golden child, particularly when conflict arises with her mother, played to perfection by Amy Madigan.  There is also her best friend, a high school counselor in a difficult patch in her marriage, perhaps on the point of split up.

The affair with the boy is beautifully handled, with all the moral dilemmas and difficulties that such situations summon in real life.  They like each other, find some fulfillment, and offer emotional succor in a painful time for them both.  You can debate about the rightness or wrongness of it, which is never resolved though it strains her old friendship with the high school counselor.  Once tragedy intervenes, it becomes very moving - and again, you see the strength of the young lady and how much she really has to give.  The viewer senses that she can get back up and make it.

This struck me as emotionally real.  It isn't for everyone because it is meant to be very serious.  Recommended.",1444089600,,1717,4.62046204620462

5859668,1,B00DVD5SBE,"Well...where to begin? We saw this on a 48 hour rental at a friends house. None of us had seen it before. And I was, frankly, embarrassed.

I am biased. I do not find Ms. Bell to be an interesting or particularly talented actress. I am not sure why. I don't know what she'll do for work when she can no longer trade on her looks. I don't think she's terrible, just not particularly special. David Lambert I think is a very good actor, and were I his agent, I would have steered him clear of this part and this film. And how this junk ever ended up at Sundance really escapes me.

What we have here is flat, boring characters in a flat, boring plot that I just couldn't care about. I couldn't care about the teen aged boy and his growing up confused angst. And I really didn't care one way or the other what happened to Ms. Bell's confused, unsmiling, depressed ""I can't find my cat"" lifeguard.
There are scenes in this movie (equally dull and predictable) that are IMHO pornographic. I am no prude. In my college days one of my part time jobs was clerking in an adult bookstore. Can I define it? No. Do I know it when I see it? Absolutely. And I have nothing against it. But I think we need to be upfront in acknowledging that it is generally gratuitous and thrown in for marketing purposes. And that's the case here.

As Ms. Bell herself pointed out in interviews she and the teenaged Lambert wanted to make these scenes as graphic as possible. And, she says, there was a ""one inch piece of fabric"" that prevented them from actually having sex. Which begs the question...why don't directors simply require their actors to have full blown sex on camera and then edit back for the R rating?  Why even bother with the so called choreography?

Without going into gross and unnecessary detail these scenes are very predictable and always involve plenty of exposed breasts (mostly female) and plenty of exposed buttocks (mostly Lambert's in this case.)  As always, there's an excess of grunting, gasping, thrusting and close ups of open mouthed moaning and heavy breathing all to the accompaniment of pounding, loud and really quite dreadful music. It's all pretty pat as these things go these days and certainly designed to spread the word there's ""good parts"" in the film. All to make it attractive to the voyeuristic crowd. Of course afterward all the actors agree that it was wasn't easy and they were all professional and on and on and on...instead of simply acknowledge the reality that ey performed sex on film for money.

We have two main characters here that are simply not very interesting. But there is another issue. Child sexual abuse. I think these stories can be told, but The Lifeguard script is not the way to do it. The nearly 30 lifeguard is engaged in a sexual affair with a 16 year old boy. (Lambert was only 19 when his part was shot to Ms. Bell's 31. In other words, when she graduated high school, he was in the 1st grade.)

The sexual abuse of boys, especially teenaged boys, is terribly under reported and certainly under prosecuted. We have a clear double standard and a tragic one. Boys are thought to have enjoyed it. That they want it, and so their abusers should be given a pass. Were this story that of a 30 old male lifeguard engaging in some heavy gymnastic sex with a 16 year old girl, most of us would be at least put off.  And we would at least expect the older character to suffer some punishment (for lack of a better word) for their behaviors. But that doesn't happen here. And to that extent, it truly reflects life.

Had she been his teacher or his buddy's mom her character would likely have been prosecuted and even imprisoned. Instead we are treated to three or four scenes of quite graphic underage sex, then the lifeguard hops in a car and heads on out to figure out the rest of her life.

The end.

5859687,4,B00DVD5SBE,"Insightful look at how indecision and career choices impact personal happiness, with Kristen Bell in the role of 29 year old Leigh, a feature writer based in New York.  After a series of job related disappointments related to how her feature stories are edited and released, she packs it all up in a fit of frustration and leaves for the comfort of home with her skeptical and somewhat supportive parents in tow.  I'm assuming most upwardly mobile young professionals wouldn't ditch it all due to one (large) project-based disappointment, and to me this is the only big flaw in the overall realism of the screenplay

Leigh's reintegration to her home, community, and friends goes well as long as it's based on parties and superficial pleasures.  Her job as a club lifeguard isn't rewarding but it satisfies some inner need for Leigh to simplify.  However, before long complications arise with her friends and she develops an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 16 year old boy, which although believable and predictable leads her to conflicted emotions about her role in his life, her choices, and whether or not this new path is constructive.

The writing and acting is solid if not spectacular and there are a few really embarrassing one liners, but over all The Lifeguard is well paced, emotionally involving, and a realistic portrayal of angst and indecision.  The only acting casualty is Amy Madigan (Leigh's mother) who's saddled with an all-too-familiar role as an uncompromising middle age hard*ss with little to no subtlety. Her character(ization) is unnecessarily abrasive.

The Lifeguard successfully straddles the line between optimism and the depressing realism of a young lady stuck in neutral.  Those expecting the usual bubbly, smiling Kristen Bell will be disappointed but her soul searching and angst ridden Leigh London is a dramatic high point.",1406505600,2,1869,5.162251655629139

5859693,4,B00DVD5SBE,"Reporter Leigh (Kristen Bell) leaves her life as journalist in New York City to go back home to Connecticut. This is due, in part, to the fact that her most recent journalist endeavour, which she was passionate about, will not be published. On returning home she gets a job as a lifeguard at her old high school. This job is not too taxing an affair, unless your day dreaming. While there she tries to reconnect with family and friends, and she does this to varying degrees of success, she also mulls over of her life. Leigh is at the cusp of turning 30, yet she begins to connect with group of troubled teens and one person in particular, instead of with her peers. Her interaction leads to smoking pot with them, and engaging in a dangerous sexual relationship with a 16-year-old.

Unfortunately this movie only received a very limited cinematic release, which I am sure did not help the film reach a wider audience. Then the film was released via video on demand. I got to see it via cable TV recently and I felt it wasn't bad indie production and good narrative. That said a number of film critics were less than impressed, and a critic at Variety magazine commented `people will be interested for any but prurient reasons', which I thought was tad harsh to say. Yes there is sexual content, but it was no more or less what you would see on a `Game of Thrones' episode.

5859695,2,B00DVD5SBE,"There may be spoilers.

Kristen Bell (""Veronica Mars"") is the draw here, especially with the poster on the DVD cover of her in a red tank suit.  She plays Leigh, a seemingly successful reporter/writer working in New York City.  She's having an affair with a married man (Sendhil Ramamurthy) who is also her boss.  After her story, about the death of a tiger kept in an apartment, receives little acknowledgement, she is close to a breakdown.  She heads back to her childhood home in Connecticut, surprising her parents (Amy Madigan and Adam LeFevre).

Leigh moves back in and gets her old job back as a lifeguard at a condo complex.  Just weeks shy of her 30th birthday, this might seem a bit odd, especially for a promising professional like Leigh.  But as a former lifeguard myself, I can remember back to age 30 thinking, yeah that lifeguard stint was a pretty sweet gig.  And then there is the 1976 movie, a similarly named ""Lifeguard,"" which starred Sam Elliot as a lifeguard pushing 40.  I digress.

The only people who seem to show up at this pool are a group of teenaged boys.  Leah strikes up some old relationships with a couple of her friends.  Mamie Gummer is very good as Mel, who is a vice principal and struggling to get pregnant.  Martin Starr plays Todd, a gay best friend.  Now almost all movies require some suspension of reality, but this story by Liz W. Garcia, who also directed, goes off the rails.  Sixteen year old ""Little"" Jason (David Lambert), one of the teens, resides at the condo complex where his dad is the maintenance man.  He begins to eyeball Leigh, and we can see what's coming.

Jason and his 2 friends ask Leigh's trio to buy them some beer.  They agree, but only after the teens score some weed.  Remember Principal Mel is part of this conspiracy.  Instead of a clean exchange, they all go into the woods to enjoy the herb and the beer.  If that isn't icky enough, Leigh acquiesces to Jason's advances and not just once.

5859697,1,B00DVD5SBE,"""Spoiler alert""

I do not know where to start here. I have seen plenty of WTF movies, but this falls below that, if there is such a thing. Your senses in this movie are just battered from about five minutes into the movie, all the way to the credits roll. I saw the the preview of this at the theatre, and it looked ok, not paying the cinema ok, but a good rental night movie ok. It is not worth the rental price. Wait for it to show up on HBO or what ever, for free!

This movie was written, produced and directed by Liz W. Garcia. Who is a 30 something. I liked her writing style with her work on Cold Case and Memphis Beat. But i am sorry, The lifeguard just drowned as a movie. Total let down for me. This is one of those movies that bother me. It had a good writer, producer and director and not to mention a well assembled cast. Yet, this movie went bad on so many subjects and aspects. I had somehow placed this as a Indie movie up there with The Station Agent. Boy, was i wrong. And i usually enjoy Indie movies a lot. They have a fresh take on everything compared to the hard financed and A list movies.

The plot has a 30 year old Leigh(Kristen Bell) pretty much fed up with her, job as a journalist and her lover and life in the City, New York and packs up her cat and cloths and off to rural Connecticut, showing up unannounced at her parents home. Where she was surprised by her old room(normal). Dad(Adam LeFevre) is excited to have her home, mom(Amy Madigan) not so much. She then meets up with old friends, Mel(Mamie Gummer), Todd(Martin Starr) and start to talk about the past. Leigh takes her old job as lifeguard at the(public?)pool. Where she meets little Jason(David Lambert) a 16 year old and his friends. The funny part is Mel is the vice principal at the high school were little David attends. Mel's husband, John(Joshua Harto) is less than thrilled. Todd is a gay art seller(stereotype?) with his own problems and just wants to smoke pot and get high.

And then you are bombarded with 30 something's smoking pot purchased from 16 year old's with the vice principal there as well. Then Leigh and little David start having sex on and off. Leigh mom kicks her out of the house she moves in with little David. Leigh's cat gets out from little davids house and goes missing. Leigh and little David are walking thru the woods looking for the cat and come across little David's teenage brother hanging from a  rope in the woods, another troubled teen who just ""wanted out"" who Todd made moves on at the party the night before. Mel gets fed up with Leighs attitude and goes to little Davids father about Leigh's sexual relationship with his son, fearing she is going to lose her job, or worse, end up in prison, if she does not do something as she is the vice principal. Mel and little David's father(John Finn) meet in the school parking lot, who pretty much tells Mel, little David has real problem's and that little David is getting laid is not something he is worried about. And it ends with Leigh driving back to the city with her cat in a car, even though she took the bus to go home. ? What i said to.

Yes there is more, but that sums it up. I really disliked the part where they have a kid casted as Scrappy Kid-Aaron(Anthony Marino)  yes it is in the credits. Him and some other young 10 year old boys are doing what boys do and run around the pool. Leigh get's on to them and tells them to stop running, and the don't. Leigh chases them into the boys bathroom where they are in the process of wetting paper towels with water. Leigh comes into the restroom to scold them and they throw the wet towels at her, like giant spit wads. She starts to scold them and the Scrappy Kid goes into a full blown ""adult"" curse out and tells her what she can do to him and where she can do it. I found that scene out of the whole movie the most disturbing. They should have found a actor at least ""18 years old"" to deliver that dialogue. Another amazing thing that movies can get away with these days.

The only other line i really did not care for was when Mel and Leigh were talking and Leigh said ""I'm sucking the youth out of him like a vampire"" in reference to Mel's suspension about Leigh and little David.

No i do not have a big problem with the four sex scenes between little David and Leigh. Nothing was shown and it was obvious what they were doing. The one sex scene with Leigh laying face down in the bed with little David on top was a problem, and far overboard for the story. I don't place that much on the fact that she was 30, or 29 as she points out and that he is 16. If a 29 year old guy and a 16 year old girl was caught, he would be in prison. However, the plot had them pretty much as secret lovers, till Todd caught little david and Leigh kissing at the pool by the snack machines.

George Lucas pulled all his weight to get Red Tails released into theatres. This movie opened in 500 more theatres to way less money. I find that sad and disturbing in itself.

Bottom line, if you are attracted or maybe like Kristen Bell's acting, you will probably find something to like in this movie. If you are expecting a great movie, and plot, you will be disappointed, as i was. This movie just missed it on so many levels.

5859706,4,B00DVD5SBE,"The reason why I love movies like this so much is because you never know where they are truly going just like in real life. Now some people say this movie doesn't seem realistic at all because of the adults hanging out with minors, sleeping with them, drinking and doing drugs. But you would be surprised sometimes people only let people see what they want them to see. The whole thing how it was immature of leigh to sleep with the 16 year old boy that's ridiculous he is not a child, and to the people who are saying he is a immature drop out and skateboarder are so ignorant not all people who drop out are dumb. If you had paid attention to the movie you would see that they were all going through the same things in their lives.. age does not make a difference. They all felt lost within their lives unhappy with them and felt as if they had no purpose. We all go through that every once in awhile whether you want to admit to it or not, we do. A long the way the helped each other out through this hard time in their lives and got through it whether it be quitting your job and starting over fresh, moving away and starting your own life etc. I think the moral of this story is that no matter where you are who you are with or even how old you are, there will be times you will feel lost. We are all humans no matter what and actually I liked that leigh and little J had a romance because they helped each other a long the way of finding where their next path in life was.. that's just how life is sometimes people will come in for a certain purpose and some will stay and some will go either way everything happens for a reason. Another reason why I  love movies like this is because they aren't your typical movie you would see in the theaters where you know how its going to end because in real life that's how everyone's life is unknown of the future or last page in the script.",1390176000,2,1888,4.116531165311653
5859707,3,B00DVD5SBE,"This is a bittersweet movie and I enjoyed watching it even though it sparked mixed feelings about it.

Leigh (Kristen Bell) is a 29 yo who spent her early adulthood years settling for little in her career and relationships. She's ticking down to her 30 year milestone and doesn't like her life so she packs up and runs back home to find herself. She takes a low-wage job as a lifeguard, which is a tangible representation of her regression since she held the same job in high school.

She reconnects with two of her high school friends who are each undergoing their own quarter-life crises. All are fighting against disappointments and struggling to realize they will have to take action to create the lifes they want. It's easier to regress than to move forward.

Juxtoposed against them are a group of high school slacker boys the adults start hanging out with. This stretched my believability. I don't buy that these two groups have enough in common to spend the summer hanging out and playing together as much as they do.

The age differences make interesting juxtopositions though. The younger set are chomping to get out into the world and are eager to leave school, get jobs, and be adults. The adults are facing the disappointments of real life versus their high school dreams. The kids are eager to move forward and the adults are paralyzed from taking the action necessary to turn their lives into some with meaning and satisfaction.

Leigh (Bell) and Little Jason (Lambert) bubble with sexual chemistry. Between the chemistry and Leigh's desparation, it's understandable why she'd seek sexual solace with a minor. And that's part of where my mixed feelings about the film came in. Having sex with a minor is totally wrong but I could also how it could happen.

Amy Madigan is wonderful in the film as Leigh's mom. She loves her daughter but wants to spread her own wings now that her daughter is grown and refuses to compromise. And in doing so, refuses to condone Leigh's regression.

Mamie Gummer does a good job with her part as Leigh's friend but her story arc is totally unbelievable. There's no way I buy a high school VP hanging out with her 16 yo students.

All in all, this is an enjoyable film and one that will leave me thinking for a while. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered and that's where it will take time to absorb. Without giving away any spoilers, the ending was believable -- given the rest of the plot.",1390003200,,2440,4.658139534883721

Someone apparently thought would make a great pet in a New York City apartment. Leigh has a bit of a crisis, having reached the age of thirty and feeling weighed down by her choices.  That is all a bit bizarre, but it's a fairly intriguing introduction to her character.

She goes back to her home town, and takes up her old summer job, lifeguarding, much to the confusion of her friends and family.

This is the best part though.

She then starts a torrent affair with a sixteen year old boy. And that is where the movie completely derailed for me.  Seriously, Leigh's actions and the tone of the movie are completely mismatched. A case of statutory rape should not be light hearted, and treated without consequence. She could have been arrested, her friend, who is the principal of the local school where the boy is a student, could have been fired.

5859713,3,B00DVD5SBE,"Like most reviewing here I'm a fan of Kristen Bell and seeing her in that red bathing suit on the cover was enough to get my attention (the producers were very smart to use that picture).  And yes, Ms. Bell looks wonderful in that bathing suit (most 30-year-old women who see this movie will feel like slitting their wrists when they see how good she looks in a one-piece).  That about covers what I found good about the movie.  I realized quickly that this was a low-budget indie film (how the hell did they manage to get a real movie star like Kristen Bell to sign on?) with a sophomoric piece of writing for a script.  It probably sounded a lot better in the writer's head; alas he/she lacks the talent to really do the subject justice.  The directing was okay, and the acting was really pretty good considering the script they had to work with.  The camerawork was inconsistent however; several close-ups were too much so; I thought I was watching a TV network show.  The characters were not very well-drawn, IMO.  I thought they were immature and shallow in keeping with the writing as a whole.  Not much happens other than the inexplicable suicide of a peripheral character.  And, as another reviewer said the motivation for Leigh returning home was sketchy at best.  All of this is typical of an indie film which is why they seldom make any money or any noise at award time.  The worst thing for me was the unrealistic sexual relationship between Leigh and Jay.  She's a beautiful 29-year-old professional woman and former HS valedictorian who could have any man she wanted, while he is an immature skate-boarding HS dropout!!!  Really?  You get the feeling this thing was written and produced by a former nerd who had (and still has) fantasies about bedding the HS prom queen.  The big question for me is why Ms. Bell thought doing this movie was a good idea.  Maybe she's not getting offers for ""mature"" roles from the big studios, who knows.  Regardless, she deserves better.  In conclusion, if you are a fan of Kristen Bell then by all means watch it just to see her; she's good in spite of the pathetic script.

5859714,4,B00DVD5SBE,"The Lifeguard is a movie that would have made an excellent YA book. Leigh (Kristen Bell), the protagonist, is an angsty, unsatisfied 29-year-old, who flees New York in horror at the thought of turning 30 while inhabiting a life that doesn't measure up to her expectations.

If that were the whole story, the movie would have been little more than melodramatic tripe. Fortunately, writer and director Liz Garcia broadens her scope to include a multi-generational cast, including Leigh's parents, her old high school friends, and a new generation of disaffected high school students. Leigh's romantic relationship with one of these high school boys serves as a catalyst for change - some beneficial, some painful, some tragic.

Garcia's writing credits include Dawson's Creek, and it shows. The plot is enjoyable soapy, with a great soundtrack, and clearly delineated metaphors (the caged lion, the well-timed rain). Fortunately, Garcia also wrote for Wonderfalls, and that influence is also apparent. The characters' misery is authentic and touching. Their reactions to each other and to the situations in which they find themselves are believable. And what could have (should have?) been a film about whiny middle-class white people making bad decisions and getting away with it instead becomes a touching story of the way we let our own limitations and disappointments define us, and the peace we can achieve if accept our own humanity.

When twenty-nine-year-old, New York City journalist, Leigh London (Bell), is overwhelmed by personal and professional crises she moves back in with her middle-aged parents in Connecticut. She takes her former high school job as the lifeguard at an apartment complex pool where she kindles a friendship with a sixteen-year-old boy, Little Jason (David Lambert). Leigh enjoys hanging out with the troubled teen and his friends and reverts back to the carefree days of adolescence. Two of Leigh's old friends, Mel (Mamie Gummer) and Todd (Martin Starr), are having personal crises of their own and join the gang. While Leigh and her adult friends retrogress back to adolescence to escape their misery, the misfit-toy teens plan to move to Vermont, which they imagine to be some type of idyllic Shangri-La. Leigh's mother can't abide her daughter's retreat from responsibility and boots her out of the house. When Mel, a school administrator, discovers Leigh has been having sex with Little Jason she is compelled to alert authorities. Leigh gets off scot-free but the close call and an ensuing tragedy snap her out of her funk and she returns to New York in search of a job.

I enjoyed Lifeguard if only for Kristen Bell's wonderful performance. Everyone's favorite Polish-American actress has been searching for a proper vehicle to showcase her talents since her three-year run on Veronica Mars. She does a fantastic job in this film. However, the idea of a twenty-nine year old woman taking advantage of a teenager is disturbing. Imagine a film about an adult male in crisis finding comfort between the legs of a sixteen-year-old girl complete with a sex scene involving a lavatory sink. Would a male protagonist have gotten away with the same hand slap that Leigh receives? There's no doubt the provocative subject matter was meant to unsettle audiences in this very limited release.

5859720,3,B00DVD5SBE,"There just isn't enough substance to ""The Lifeguard"" to make it worthy of watching more than one time.  A large part of the problem lies in the screenwriting.  From the start, the central character of ""Leigh"" isn't fleshed out very well.  She takes leave from her job as an associated press writer because she is assigned to cover a story about a tiger cub who died after being left chained in an apartment.  That alone should leave most viewers scratching their heads in wonder.

She takes respite by returning to the picaresque but boring small town where she grew up, to revisit her earlier, happier life as a lifeguard.  She is employed at a pool unlike any I've ever visited.  Most of the time she is the lone authority figure, with no superior, and no co-workers to interact with.  Apparently no one is there to check the clothes baskets, or take money.

She makes friends with some punkish skateboarders who seem to remind her of old times, while she reconnects with friends who are trying to make it in their ""adult"" roles and jobs while avoiding the old temptations.  But, Leigh has too strong of an urge to go back to her ""Dazed and Confused"" days, and so she leads her friends off into the woods for various daylight and nighttime dalliances with nature and controlled substances.

Kristen Bell has a nice film presence, similar to Jennifer Jason Leigh (or to go even further back, to Glynnis O'Connor in the 1970's).  She deserves better parts than this one.  Though ""The Lifeguard"" has a nice look to it, the movie makes you wonder how many good roles are available these days for young actresses, when so many successful movies are either blockbuster special-effects laden comic book extravaganzas, or silly, gross-out comedies.

Amy Madigan (""Field of Dreams"") has a nice turn as Leigh's mother, and Adam Lefevre (who starred in one of the very first ""indies"", ""Return of the Seacaucus Seven"") plays the father.  After an introductory scene, those characters disappear for over a half an hour, although Madigan's confrontation with her daughter later on turns out to be the best scene in the movie.  The plot and characters are just too weak to sustain the movie---not too mention the music, which is as mediocre as dishwater.

As I approached the final moments of The Lifeguard, the only thing I could think of was, ""Well, that was underwhelming."" I've been watching a lot of indie films recently and caught the trailer for this movie a few weeks back. It looked interesting enough, and I enjoy Kristen Bell, so I figured, why not? However, the movie fails to pick up speed, reach a satisfying conclusion, or answer the many questions the story leaves you with, which is unfortunate considering the trailer showed so much promise.

The story follows a New York reporter by the name of Leigh London (Bell). After having a mid-life crisis at the ripe age of 29, Leigh moves back home to Connecticut with her parents; Justine (Amy Madigan) and Hans (Adam LeFevre). After quickly reconnecting with her high school friends Mel (Mamie Gummer) and Todd (Martin Starr), Leigh gets her old high school job as a lifeguard. It doesn't take long before she meets a group of young teens who remind her of her youth, and pretty soon she starts a relationship that is harmful for everyone involved.

Most of the story elements in The Lifeguard aren't new, but that's not what makes this a poor film. For starters, there seems to be a major lack of focus from the moment we meet Leigh to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is all over the place, trying to cover many different topics, but none of them are discussed thoroughly enough. For example, Mel is married to a man named John (Joshua Harto). It's clear that the couple has a rocky relationship, but the audience never discovers why. At first we're led to believe that John may be abusive or controlling, but nothing ever gets explained.

Another good example would be Todd's life. In the final act of the film it seems as if the writers are going to uncover some personal issues that he's been hiding, but they never reveal what it is. They peel back the curtain just enough to grab your attention, but then close it shut before they're forced to discuss it. Honestly, it made no sense to me. If you don't want to go in-depth with a character, why half-ass it? Either include it in the story or don't. Because if you don't go all the way it just makes the writers look bad.

What bothered me most of all, though, was that the film tried too hard to be artsy. There were these constant long, unnecessary pauses that did nothing except make certain scenes longer. By the end of it, all the time we wasted looking at someone stare off into the distance could've been better spent explaining these characters. Truthfully, I felt as if I didn't even know Leigh. As a character, she lacked focus and a personality that was consistent with itself. Also, she was another individual who seemed to have issues that went beyond what was on the surface, but nothing was ever discussed.

What I did like, though, was the acting and the soundtrack. For the most part, the cast is solid across the board, and everyone gave convincing performances. Kristen Bell did the best with what she was given, and I think David Lambert (Little Jason) and Martin Starr showed that they have a lot of potential for dramatic roles. In addition, the soundtrack--consisting of music from The Esthettes, Plants and Animals, and Cocosuma--was nearly flawless. I won't lie, I am unfamiliar with every piece of music that was used, but it definitely set the perfect tone.

Overall Score: 5.8/10 - I'll admit, after I watched this film the score in my head was slightly higher, but the more I thought about it, the more irritated I became. There's a solid foundation for a good story, but The Lifeguard winds up falling flat on its face on more than one occasion. While it may have a solid cast and an enjoyable collection of songs, it is weighed down by a weak, unfocused story. If you thought it looked interesting I would recommend giving it a rental, but it's not something you should go out of your way to see.",1383523200,,3961,4.6178977272727275

5859729,3,B00DVD5SBE,"THE LIFEGUARD is a slow-moving, meandering film that consists more of people talking (often shouting and/or crying) than stuff actually happening, a unique hybrid of TV Land melodrama and erotic comedy. If you want a riveting story, suspense, action, and that sort of thing, you'll probably be quite bored by this film despite one or two good surprises toward the end. If you're attracted to the apparent erotic qualities of THE LIFEGUARD, be advised, the only nudity is brief and male--Kristen Bell does not reveal much even though there are some brief coital scenes.

Still, THE LIFEGUARD should appeal to certain specific tastes: Those who like Lifetime films and soap operas? It's very well-filmed, with some pretty New England scenery. The whole theme of the difficulties of growing up and the rigors of both childhood and adulthood also shines through here. Most of the acting is so-so, but the child and teenaged actors give some fairly memorable performances.",1383004800,3,967,5.120253164556962

5859738,2,B00DVD5SBE,"*SPOILER*
After watching the trailer, I was really looking forward to watch the film. I literally sat down with popcorn and soda. Honestly, whoever wrote the script did not provide enough background for Leigh's breaking point to return home. If it's simply because of her article and Raj, then I find her really weak and spoiled. Perhaps, they should have made Leigh go through something more tragic that would throw her entire life into an existential crisis. Then she decides that she needs to revert back to her childish ways in order to be happy. That would have made the audience sympathize with her more. She returns home to a mother who only cares about herself and what she wants, and her father who is the only one who cares about her. There is so many things wrong with that. You would think the mother would miss her own daughter. The mother is a very disturbing character. I also find Mel and her husband's relationship to be very fake. They do not seem to love each other at all because their relationship is based on the husband's control and Mel being submissive. Wasn't Jason kissing another girl in the beginning? I'm assuming he has a girlfriend, so why the sudden interest in Leigh? I would understand why Leigh is willing to throw herself at him because she is desperate for love from someone after dealing with a previous bad lover and a cold mother, but Jason's interest is still a mystery. I really did not see the sex montage coming. It would have been gross if the sexes were swapped, but it's still weird. Then there is a teen suicide. Why did he do it? It seemed so sudden without any reason at all. The only things that I did like in this movie were the symbols. The constant rain and gloomy weather to symbolize sadness and confusion. Leigh wears a red bathing suit to symbolize danger when she pursues a relationship with Jason. Then there is the irony of how her job is to save others, but she fails to save herself from such an illicit relationship. The ending with her driving is awkward, but there is light to show that finally understands her life and is no longer in a state of confusion. Overall, I found the movie to be quite dry. It's definitely not one of those where after you watch it, you feel impacted by the emotions. I merely said one word after the end, ""meh"".",1380412800,2,2307,4.495238095238095

There were many moments that were uncomfortable, but she played them so well that you almost forgot that you should be uncomfortable.

5859744,4,B00DVD5SBE,"This is a touching film about depression and how people make mistakes. I think kristen Bell did an amazing performance in conveying this. Its about a girl that is unhappy with her life in the BIG city and wants a break. Which I can totally relate to the character in many ways. Sometimes when you are alone in a big city people are really cold and noncaring about alot of things. Also everything is rush rush rush and go go go noone cares about the real things that matter. So being that I am familiar with this and moved back to a more down home town this movie makes plenty of sense. I also lived with my dad for a short time to regroup and get my mind intact.

Kristen retreats back home to live with mom and dad to sort her life out . She also wants time to get over her depression and to rethink things out and live a simple life for a while. Shes deeply damaged being that she was having an affair with a married man back in the city . So her judgement is clouded tainted and she feels she has no self worth and vunerable. So she meets a group of young guys one in particular 17 years old and becomes more than aquainted. So they get envolved and become really close in many ways. So this is when everything unravels and things start to become hectic between families and friends. This is a good movie and it shows that nobody is perfect and people make mistakes and bad judgements when the chips are down. The ending was sad because they obviously had to both go there seperate ways. Watch this with a open mind because everyone isn't perfect and sometimes we do things out of pain and suffering and loneliness. This is probably her best performance outside of comedy since Roman and Pulse. I am glad to see her doing more serious roles veronica mars should be interesting next year.

5859746,4,B00DVD5SBE,"This is an indie film about life without much plot. Leigh London (Kristen Bell) is an AP reporter who has become depressed with life. She wrote a story about a chained tiger cub living in the city apartment that dies. She sees herself in this role, as well as just about everyone else in the film fits the metaphor. People view themselves as developing while everyone else sees them as screw-ups.

Leigh moves back with her parents, and mom (Amy Madigan) would rather not have her there. She hangs out with old friends; Todd (Martin Starr) a gay art dealer and Mel (Mamie Gummer) who is now the vice principal. Mel's life is in a rut, her husband (Joshua Harto) doesn't fit in because he is too straight. Leigh becomes a lifeguard at the local apartment complex, however like the tiger, the title has a two-fold meaning.

The story slips into taboo areas such as smoking pot with minors...and having sex with them. There are lines that are crossed, i.e. ""they are screw-ups"" or the less family friendly phrase, but they don't see themselves as that because the transition is smooth and natural. The film is about how life and people are the same all over (except for Vermont).

Clearly this film is not for everyone. It opens like a Lifetime film with raindrops symbolizing sadness. It evolves into a film which would make you embarrassed to watch it with your kids. Indie lovers only, please.

5859747,4,B00DVD5SBE,"I must admit it took me a while to truly process this movie. I absolutely adore Kristen Bell, so I will pretty much watch anything she's in. I was also pleasantly surprised to see the guy who plays Brandon on the Fosters, which quickly became a favorite of mine. Anyway, when I watched this a couple of weeks ago, my conclusion was that the movie was okay. It left me feeling kind of sad and very confused, and I assumed that was due to flaws of the movie. Looking back now, I think that was kind of their intention. I think I was feeling a lot of what Lee felt. What I love about indie movies is that they are typically more unpredictable, awkward, messy and real. There's no glam. Things can be ugly. Some indie films take it too far and alienate a lot of people, which this film may do, but overall I feel it's an honest story of someone completely losing their sense of self, and in turn reverting back to what they know.

Also I think the issue of a romantic relationship between a 16 year old and a 29 year old should be addressed. I've read outlandish comments on IMDB and so on that this movie condones pedophilia, which is absolutely ridiculous. First of all, pedophilia is an attraction to prepubescent children, not adolescents. Physically, adolescents and adults are very much the same, it's simply a matter of mental capacity for good decision making and impulse control that makes it ethically questionable to engage in a sexual act. It isn't like Lee was sexually attracted to an 8 year old boy or something, so statutory rape, yes. Pedophilia, no. Also, while I absolutely wouldn't condone this type of thing happening in real life, I think cinematically, the emotional side of their relationship was very helpful to both of them for the time being.

Overall, I liked this movie, and wouldn't be opposed to watching it again, even though it does have some very heavy subject matter. Kristen Bell is an amazing actress and she showed a lot of depth in this.",1377388800,27,1972,4.536516853932584
5859748,2,B00DVD5SBE,"i couldn't tell, rousing myself from spates of boredom and disappointment, if this was a feeble movie that kristen bell was supposed to lift from mediocrity with her perky watchable presence, or if kristen bell's career was supposed to get to the next level by starring in a realistic study of age 30 indecision that includes hot coitus on a public restroom sink. it didn't work either way.

the problem with a story about ""adults"" (age 30 more or less) hanging out with ""kids"" (age 16 more or less) is that i already don't like the adults and don't care about their problems or their lives. (if i have to explain that to you, then you might actually enjoy this movie.) and the problem with a story about kids hanging out with adults is that they're, you know, duh ... kids.

is there a point to this film? yes: the point is that sometimes in life you get to the end of the diving board and can't make the jump, which makes the shallow end of the pool look pretty tempting -- especially when the people telling you to jump are an uptight mother or an uptight husband. but that makes this a film about people swimming in the shallow end of the pool, and how that makes them all wet. being all wet isn't that tragic or that interesting, and throwing in a criminal sexual relationship between bell and an underage boy only makes it worse. the stakes turn out to be inconsequential for everyone involved (except one kid, in a plot twist telegraphed with big neon supertitles -- ""trouble ahead! bad trouble for this kid!""). and at the climactic point in the movie where a great emotional resolution or personal realization is usually required, it turns out to be this: the lifeguard finds a lost cat in an unfinished home addition. kristen, have a serious talk with your agent.",1377216000,,1772,4.517133956386293

The FIRST problem with this movie, is that it marginalizes statutory rape. That's the kindest way of putting it. There are just so many little (yet somehow huge) things wrong with the story itself that it just offends everyone. You don't feel sorry for this main character. You don't even like her, and you have the thought to report her for child molestation. And honestly, if the movie was about a 30 year old dealing with her feelings for a high schooler, it might make for acceptable cinema. But that's not what this movie is. This movie is a coming of age story... for a 30 year old. That's messed up so much that I don't even think I have anymore words for this review.
