8459151,5,B000XAACVO,"This Series is extremely well done both in story line and in animation quality.  It is not for the prudish as there are several scenes with people in realistic situations.  If you're looking for a tight well written adventure that will soon make you forget that this is anime, this is for you!  Its story line is about a war photographer that has been sickened by war.  He becomes involved with the investigation of a cult.  During this investigation he takes up the plight of a young girl and in his efforts to save her makes the biggest sacrifice a photographer can make.  The action never stops so you will be hard pressed to interrupt this series.  Violence, sex and rock and roll, not for immature viewing.",1203811200,3,711,4.551181102362205
