8761538,5,B01FUESEJO,"This set of wildlife films is arguably one of the most outstanding UK nature sets available from an already outstanding library of BBC nature films. Published as recently as 2016 and making use of the very latest video advances it wonderfully captures the scenery and natural inhabitants of the Scottish Highlands most wonderfully.

Ewan McGregor provides the voice-over commentary in a manner that clearly communicates his own engagement with the material rather than just reading the script. This makes an important contribution to the success of the presentation and, thankfully, all musical contributions are restrained from destroying the natural sounds so essential to the audio-visual filming.

As one who has the privilege and enjoyment of daily experiencing numerous red squirrels visiting from the nearby forest to top up on food from the garden feeders, there is a very personal connection with that element of the series!

It has not been possible to do an A / B comparison with the DVD option of this series but it seems likely that it too will be of high quality. For those who own Blu-ray players though, the choice seems simple - buy the Blu-ray!

In summary, this set of BD films offers a wonderful insight into the beautiful world of the Scottish Highlands.
