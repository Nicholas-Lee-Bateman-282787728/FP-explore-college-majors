5105091,3,B007R4IP1S,"1883. Montana, Wyoming, Dakotas.

Christian Slater stars as ""Cincinnati"" John Mason, a man wanted for murder in Missouri. Donald Sutherland plays a marshal hunting him down. Meanwhile, there is a group of hooded bandits robbing stage coaches and the mail. We, the audience, know the identity of the bandits, while John tries to figure it out because they shot and killed his father. John has a love interest in Alice (Jill Hennessy) and whiskey.

The movie is supposed to be a remake of the 1935 John Wayne film, which somehow I missed. I found Slater to lack the charisma and toughness to play a cowboy. While not terrible, he was unconvincing. The soundtrack was cowboy cliche with all the bells and whistles (literally) that we have come to watch in modern spoofs. The movie has slow moving sequences of long drawn out dialouge with frequent pauses for the characters to take a long breath or a swig of whiskey. Once the film gets about half way through it picks up and even had some decent scenes.

If you looking for a western to download off Amazon, this one beats out ""Hells Fury""  and ""Hell at my Heels"" by a long shot.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity. Two adults in bed after sex.",1338595200,17,1184,4.566037735849057
5105092,4,B007R4IP1S,"I have not seen John Waynes' movie of the same name. However, this movie was very entertaining and enjoyable. I've always liked Slater and Southerland, and in this one they did not let me down. My big shock was Jill Hennessy (Crossing Jordan). She is the most engaging that I have ever seen her! Good western with plenty of gun play, good scenery, good acting and a good story. If you like westerns, give this one a try. No nudity, violence, blood, no gore, sexual situations and an ending you probably won't see coming. Unless a reviewer spoils it. Southerland is a marshall/ pinkerton hunting Slater, so he can get the large bounty. Slater is an exlawman staying a step ahead of Southerland. Along the way, alot of things happen both good and bad and the story gets real interesting. I lost count of the number of shootings in this movie, but it is alright as I was having a good time watching it.",1338422400,7,899,4.487804878048781

5105097,4,B007R4IP1S,"""Dawn Rider  begins in Dakota Territory 1883 with Donald Sutherlands character, Cochrane, closing in on fugitive Cincinnatti John Mason (Christian Slater). Mason, an ex-Pinkerton, returns home, and after a failed robbery by masked men, is looking for the persons responsible for his dads murder. He gets involved in both the mystery of his death and a love triangle with Alice Gordon (Jill Hennessy). The band of masked men are conducting robberies, but one of them has a vital reason for wanting the money. This movie is unusual because both the robbers and the reasons are revealed as they happen, leaving us to watch as John Mason discovers the truth, but there is one surprise reveal near the end. But it probably would have been better to leave the audience in the dark. Only Johns fate is unknown and revealed at the very end. Marvelous acting, but there are plot holes, like the Sutherland character's actions. Starring Christian Slater, Jill Hennessy, and Donald Sutherland. Directed by Terry Miles. Very Definitely Recommended. Three and a half ENGAGING Stars! (90 minutes)",1414195200,,1082,5.078651685393258
