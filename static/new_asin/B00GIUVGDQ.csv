6078330,4,B00GIUVGDQ,"I liked this French TV series and wish France had decided to make a sequel, although it would have been difficult to plot out a sequel given Dolmen's plot, even if the ending did give the producers a possible lead in to a second series.  It made me wish more French TV series had English subtitles--I am trying to improve my French.  A few of the main actors in Dolmen immediately went on to other roles.",1412985600,2,404,4.302631578947368
6078331,1,B00GIUVGDQ,This is perhaps the stupidest and worst acted european crime series i have ever seen. The pseudo mystical elements in the plot are no more implausible than the supposedly rational parts of the story line. The main female detective has obviously used all her salary on botox and breast enlargement and while pouting her way through an endlessly repeating series of cliched situations seems incapable of doing anything other than convincing me that rubbish television is an international phenomenon. Then again maybe its a comedy it is that bad !!!,1408665600,10,546,5.0777777777777775
6078332,5,B00GIUVGDQ,Excellent French Drama Series set in 6 seasons or episodes.  The characters are portrayed by actors that are thoroughly believeable.  The backdrop is absolutely gorgeous.  The plot is so well-developed that you keep guessing until the very end.  I was completely shocked.  There are also separate mysteries that take place along the same route as the main mystery.  It's an all-together edge of your seat romantic suspense that will have you totally intrigued.,1405814400,2,460,5.232876712328767
6078333,1,B00GIUVGDQ,"Poorly acted, silly, occasionally incoherent story, with the feel of an afternoon 'soapy'. It seemed to me to be dumbed down for God knows what kind of audience.",1404691200,7,161,4.785714285714286
6078334,4,B00GIUVGDQ,When I saw the previews for this story I really didn't know if I would take the time to watch it. I decided to watch the first episode and was very glad I did. I found I had to follow the characters closely or I wouldn't have been able to follow the story line. I would recommend this to anyone for a night of entertainment. the main two characters are very impressive in how their relationship evolves and the family lines are something that needed following closely. I really liked it very much.,1398211200,2,497,4.354838709677419
6078335,5,B00GIUVGDQ,"A captivating screenplay, beautifully filmed and artistically directed.  The title refers to a circle of stones around which the plot revolves. The twists begin early in the first episode, and the tension holds you until the very last scene.  The cast is superb, with wonderful interpersonal chemistry. The subtitles are excellent, and compliment the French dialogue.",1391385600,8,367,5.535714285714286
8623636,2,B00GIUVGDQ,"Ugh,  not great acting, some really bad edits and the story has zero surprises. I love French television, especially their cop shows and amazing dramas,  i.e. spiral and A French Village, but this was a little embarrassing at times. Just really not good. I'm really surprised that it was popular in France, although maybe in the early 2000's they didn't have very good television shows.",1529884800,,386,4.923076923076923
8623637,5,B00GIUVGDQ,Really like the show.,1505174400,,21,4.5
8623638,3,B00GIUVGDQ,"Ridiculous plot, hackneyed writing and a rather odd actress in the lead. I kept watching the overlong series just to find out the ending. Sort of a French version of a Lifetime TV movie. The island is beautiful, however. Its watchable, just not very good.",1494288000,,255,4.688888888888889
8623639,5,B00GIUVGDQ,This story was filmed on the island of Belle Isle off the coast of Brittany. I was there in 1974 and had no idea that this story was connected with that particular island. It sure has changed. They changed the name in the film because they did not want to give  Belle Isle a bad reputation as a haunted site. I would love to go back and see the Dolmens and the harbor.,1461024000,,368,4.041095890410959
8623640,3,B00GIUVGDQ,"The photography is great.  The story?  Well, it's ok but not really fantastic.",1450051200,,78,4.923076923076923
8623641,5,B00GIUVGDQ,"Something different with the setting in Brittany, and a tale involving old legends and the stone circles.  It makes a change to watch actors from another country whom you have never seen before, and different locations.  Who knew Brittany was so beautiful!  I wanted to move there right away.  Reminded me a little of the Wickerman without the surprise ending.  I would love to see the serial, but I hear it will not be made.",1433980800,,425,4.613333333333333
8623642,4,B00GIUVGDQ,The English subtitles cannot be hidden.,1429660800,,39,5.666666666666667
