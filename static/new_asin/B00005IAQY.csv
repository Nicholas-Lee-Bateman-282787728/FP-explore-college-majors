7938238,5,B00005IAQY,This exercise video by Denise Austin really works. I started off doing level one in the morning for the 10 minutes. Later I did the level one in the morning and level two in the evening. As I got stronger I did level one and two in the morning and level three in the evening. My motivation was telling myself that 10 minutes was nothing compared to the twenty-four hours in a day. I hate to exercise but the 10 minutes goes by really fast and then your done. My arms are slimmer. My chest and shoulders are firmer. I also have Denise Austin's shortcuts abs and legs. I use all three videos. I have gone from a size 14/16 to fitting into a tight size 8. I went from 172 pounds to 148 pounds. I still hate to exercise but I love the results. I exercise 6 days a weeks. I also chose a diet to fit my lifestyle. I am ready to increase my weights now to continue my workouts. I get lots of looks and questions about what am I doing. I am hooked on getting the results and looking good.,1407196800,,980,4.056701030927835
7938239,5,B00005IAQY,I bought both of the Denise Austin Shortcuts Videos and found this one particularly effective. I did only 10 minute workouts and it actually tired me out. I feel that I have done something good for myself and it didn't take up much time at all.,999648000,7,244,4.326086956521739
