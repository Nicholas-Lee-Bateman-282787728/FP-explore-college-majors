8413292,5,B000H2NHHY,"This DVD is absolutely fantastic! I have been a Bob Hope fan since the early years and this DVD series reunites the old memories. I'm pretty sure I laugh more now than I did when I was a little kid. Jackie Gleason's comical performances combined with the musical stylings of Frank Sinatra make for truly engaging entertainment. In fact, my children have even become fans of the DVDs.",1164585600,,383,4.647058823529412
