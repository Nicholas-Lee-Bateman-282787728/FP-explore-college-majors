2398858,5,B000AYYV6A,"This review is a combination of opinions: mine and those of my 8-year-old.

These DVDs rock!  We now know to bring a big plastic sheet with us in the desert, and how to get drinking water from condensation.  (Although, we have yet to test it.)

We have been inspired to combine cornstarch and water for a fun ""non-Newtonian fluid.""  And, Alex is definitely learning - the other day, he started talking about ""non-Newtonian fluids"" even though he hasn't seen that episode for at least a month.

Very interesting.  For example, learning physics through juggling lessons (hopefully we'll put that one into practice soon!)

This DVD set, while I have watched only a few episodes, appears to be without violence, so we let our 3-year-old watch as well.  He is just as entertained as our 8-year-old.

Also, five stars for no gratuitous use of junk food, unlike Bill Nye and so many other brainy shows.  There is nothing in this series to irritate atheists nor libertarians.",1218844800,,967,4.8
2398859,5,B000AYYV6A,"As a children's librarian and mother of a young child, I am always in search of responsible DVDs for kids.  Popular Mechanics for Kids does not disappoint.  Each episode is informative, well-paced and always interesting.  My son (age 5) loves the entire series and I don't have to worry about his brain rotting as he watches.",1210550400,,325,4.767857142857143
2398860,4,B000AYYV6A,"Popular mechanics for kids is a great series exploring science topics that appeals to kids of a great range of ages (well - at least from 6 to 8, which is how old my 2 boys are).  Certainly entertaining, and moderately informative, although perhaps a tiny bit light on the actual science.  But for younger kids, it's perfect.",1209686400,,325,4.586206896551724
2398861,5,B000AYYV6A,"My son is 5 months old and already very interested in how things work.  I have been borrowing various videos from the library trying to find things that will interest him through various levels of his development, while at the same time limiting the 'fluffy candy dumbing down' effect most kids shows have to offer.
  I thought maybe these would be over his head, but they are energetic enough to hold his attention.
  I like to watch his shows with him to see what they are teaching, and these videos are interesting to me as well.  They open the door to a lot more research we can do on the web when he gets older.
  What I like most is the sense of adventure they impart, there are tons of fascinating things going on all over the world that kids can be a part of exploring.",1207267200,,777,4.273972602739726
2398862,5,B000AYYV6A,This set was teriffic for my grandchildren and is very educational.  My two grandsons ages 4 & 5 spend hours watching this very informative dvds.  They are worth every penny and are a real bargain.,1198972800,,197,4.6
2398863,5,B000AYYV6A,"This videos are packed with information that facinates kids of all ages.
Our 4 year old likes them as much as our 8 year old.  He's been asking a lot of questions like ""Why does air coming out of the rocket make it go forward?"".  These videos are thought - provoking and fun.  I highly recommend them.",1193011200,,301,4.245614035087719
2398864,5,B000AYYV6A,Having a boy and girl is often tough when they want to watch different movies.  I thought this was a must have! I purchased the set right before we went on a 13 hour drive for vacation and it was a hit.  I did not feel guilty letting them watch dvd's that I knew were informative and fun to watch.  My children were entertained and educated at the same time.  A double bonus! These are great for boys and girls.  Would recommend them to teachers!,1184112000,6,446,4.2
2398865,5,B000AYYV6A,"My kids ages 6 and 7 LOVE PMK, they've learned so many really cool things watching PMK.  I bought one DVD just to see what it was like, then two more and two more, and two more.  Now I just ordered the newest ones coming out.  They are always telling me about this fact or that and I actually like watching them too.",1153958400,8,316,3.984126984126984
2398866,5,B000AYYV6A,"We initially borrowed ""Radical Rockets"" from the library and my 4 year old son instantly became a die-hard fan of PMK.  I decided to invest in the 6 DVD set for Christmas and it has been worth every penny!  These are easily his favorite videos.  While Charlie may seem silly to adults, his experiments get real science across to kids in a fun and easy way.  My son thinks he's hysterical and talks about the PMK kids as if they're his buddies.  His preschool teacher says he talks about his ""mechanics videos"" all the time as he explains (in his 4 year old way) things like how rockets work or how to survive in the desert to her.  Highly recommended and definitely worthwhile - a fun, educational series for kids.",1138233600,18,714,4.453846153846154
2398867,5,B000AYYV6A,We found this series at our local library. My 6 year old son requests them frequently and repeatedly. He will be so thrilled to have them all to choose from at home! Lots of great science information and very entertaining!,1292284800,,222,4.575
2398868,5,B000AYYV6A,"My 5 year old loves PMK. I like them too. We bought a few episodes and rent others from Netflix.

We also love National Geo's Wild Detective series.",1291075200,,148,4.285714285714286
2398869,5,B000AYYV6A,"We first became acquainted with PMK for kids at our local library. My children are 4,6,and 8. All 3 were enthralled. The set is not only interesting but educational. Buy it-you won't regret it.",1282867200,,193,4.705882352941177

2398871,5,B000AYYV6A,"Wonderful dvds.  I highly recommend all of the PMK dvds.  They are interesting, educational and entertaining.  Well worth the money.  You will be glad you purchased them.  Kids (as well as adults) can learn so much from these.  A wonderful way to learn about science stuff :)",1275350400,,275,4.74468085106383
2398872,5,B000AYYV6A,"I was very happy with the delivery of these DVD's. They came in plenty of time for Christmas and packaged nicely. My son loves these DVD's and I enjoy watching them with him. They are so educational and fun, too. They hold a kids' interest and we have both learned so much!",1261785600,,273,4.269230769230769
2398873,5,B000AYYV6A,"I have problems finding quality educational programs for my gifted child.  My son has no interest in shows geared for his age.  My three year old will watch every PMK episode over and over.  His attention never strays when watching any of them.  After renting them so many times, I decided to just buy the boxed set.  It is still his favorite show to watch.",1249257600,,357,4.430769230769231
2398874,5,B000AYYV6A,My kids absolutely love this series.  They watch it over and over.  They learn so much and tell all their friends about all they have learned.  I've even lent them to their teachers during certain lessons as enhancement.  Well worth the price,1241308800,,242,4.690476190476191
2398875,5,B000AYYV6A,"If I leave my youngest daughter to make her own television veiwing choices, inevitably she will gravitate towards mindless cartoons.  The most notable exception is PMK.  Se loves these programs and even watches them repeatedly.  I've watched most of them with her and find them pretty informative.  I was looking for new episodes tonight because when I got home from work she reported to me that our cat has tapeworms, explained her diagnosis, and recited what she knew about tapeworms and their causes in pets from the program section ""nix and tics"" talking about parasites.  She hadn't seen that program in months, but clearly it stuck.  It is apparent she's learning from these programs.",1226966400,3,690,5.008771929824562
2398876,4,B000AYYV6A,"Our kids love this DVD set.  They watch their DVD players when they go to bed, but they can only watch educational DVDs.  This is the perfect option.  They both (4 and 7 years) love them.",1222732800,,187,4.138888888888889

8081109,4,B000AYYV6A,My grandsons were on roller coasters for the first time and wanted to know more about them so this dvd showed them what they needed to  know.  The other dvds were very informative too,1341532800,,183,4.352941176470588
8081110,5,B000AYYV6A,My 5 yr old grandson loves these DVDs. They are well written and well developed story lines. Our whole family has learned so much about science. I would recommend this series to any one with elementary children to introduce concepts of science. We first checked them out from the library and loved them so much that we ordered our own copies.,1339632000,,342,4.622950819672131

8081112,5,B000AYYV6A,"The kids (ages 12, 10, and 7)and I watched a Popular Mechanics for Kids on Netflix first and they liked it so much they asked me to order more.  We home school and these movies are at the top of our list for something that is really fun to watch and educational.

8081115,5,B000AYYV6A,"These DVDs are so full of information, and very entertaining. Even my child who prefers Spongebob to anything remotely educational loves these DVDs (especially Slither and Slime).  They really do a great job of explaining how things work, and having kid hosts and a good dose of comedy keeps kids' attention.",1305331200,,308,5.03921568627451
8081116,5,B000AYYV6A,My daughters have enjoyed all 6 DVD's for years now.  My oldest would borrow 2 dvd's each week from the library for well over a year straight!  She never tired of watching them and now my youngest has fallen in love with them too.  They've learned quite a bit from watching them.,1301875200,,279,4.326923076923077
