6554878,3,B00M428D06,"As an admirer of Kwiecien, and a fan of the opera, Don Giovanni, I was anxious to see how this production stacked up against others I've seen. He did not disappoint at all, and the supporting cast was adequate. However, I found the set off-putting to the point of distraction and this causes me to offer only a middling opinion of this offering of the Mozart classic.",1425772800,2,367,4.492537313432836
6554879,5,B00M428D06,"This Blu-Ray DVD, recorded in 2014 at the Royal Opera House (Nicola Luisotti conducts the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House), is a stunning example of what a talented director and cast can accomplish with a masterpiece.

Mariusz Kwiecien is *outstanding* as Don Giovanni, bringing warmth, loathing, and a touch of sorrow for Giovanni who cant stop seducing women and does not want to stop (in the extras, he refers to Giovanni as a dreamer  interesting).  Alex Esposito does fine work as Leoprello, demonstrating exceptional physical skills along with comedic timing and solid vocals.  Malin Bystrom is fantastic as Donna Anna, Giovannis latest conquest and the woman whose father Giovanni murders as he leaves her house.  Antonio Poli is very satisfying as Don Ottavio, and Elizabeth Watts performance as Zerlina is just simply outstanding.  But for me, soprano Veronique Gens was captivating as the woman that hates Giovanni and still loves him at the same time, wishing that he would come back to her while at the same time wanting him to pay for his behavior  she is simultaneously vulnerable and hurt and strong and sorrowful.  Ms. Gens is just amazing.

The set of Giovannis house rotates and is designed to be projected upon, and the lighting and video design work is marvelous.  Everything about this production, from the tightly choreographed character and set interactions to the visual interactions between the costumes and the projected names from the Dons little black book, are well thought out and painstakingly done.  And the orchestra does an incredible job with the score, accompanying the characters on their journey and seeing to it that the cast has a firm and delightful foundation upon which to sing against.

The extra features present on the disc are also interesting, giving the various performers feelings about their characters and the way they see them, as well as some behind-the-scenes insight into the rehearsal process and what the Kasper Holten (director) was trying to accomplish.  There is also a Directors Commentary that can be turned on while the opera is being performed.

This is definitely a performance worthy of the Blu-Ray medium, both sonically (the sound quality is *wonderful*) and visually, as every nuance is conveyed as best as it can be without being live in the opera house.  Very highly recommended!",1421798400,,2354,5.09375
6554880,5,B00M428D06,"Everything about the new Blu-ray disc of the early 2014 Royal Opera production of Don Giovanni is of the highest quality. Director Kasper Holtens conception of the opera as psycho-drama is well-served by Es Devlins design, by the singing and acting chops of the cast, and by the stylish playing of the Royal Opera House orchestra under the direction of Nicola Luisotti. First and foremost is, of course, Marius Kwiecien as the Don. His strengths as a singer are only surpassed by his acting ability. From Don Giovannis initial swagger to the torments of the finale Kwiecien commands the stage (and the camera) with a huge range from violent intimidation to the subtlest portrayal of his internal insecurities. Its a majestic performance that matches the finest work of the greatest stage or screen actors I can think of.

To this superman/monster Mozart adds humanity with a great cast of supporting characters. Alex Esposito is an outstanding Leporello, bringing comedy and pathos in equal measure. Both Malin Bystrom as Donna Anna and Veronique Gens as Donna Elvira are amazing singers, but also fine actresses who create rounded characters rather than merely wronged and vengeful stock figures.

Blu-ray is the perfect medium for Mozarts drama, which is oddly intimate, even claustrophobic, while it deals with the widest range of human emotion and supernatural forces.",1417478400,,1372,5.175675675675675
6554881,5,B00M428D06,"There are dozens of performances of Don Giovanni available on Blu-ray , DVD and CD. Many are excellent and some exceptionally good. But this performance, I think is a rung above the rest on the current market. I have gone through many of these and have a dozen or so - so why is this one exceptional? It is the depth of the psychological drama on top of the familiar story and exquisite music that comes across in this production. Director Kasper Holton and Designer Es Devlin have put together an entity that involves a complicated, confining but brilliant set and a cast that is not only able to sing the music accurately and passionately but also to act out the drama so well they become the characters and the audience is drawn into the evolving story.
The conceit of using projections of the names of past love conquests on the set walls from time to time plus a variety of other effects helps in maintaining focus on what is playing before us.
The cast is superb! Each member is a star performer so capable of singing the role that they can really become immersed as actors in the depths of the drama. I personally have never appreciated what a deep disquieting drama this piece is; what a brilliant work Mozart and da Pont have created.
""Don Giovanni is Don Giovanni"" the old slogan goes and Mariusz Kwiechen is the Giovanni of the day. I knew his command as a romantic baritone his impassioned performance in a great Eugene Onegin with Netrebko. There he brought out the drama as I'd never seen before. In this performance he gets inside the role of the ageing Don and shows his fears and the hollowness behind the salacious exterior.
Alex Esposito is the top Leporello of the day and he certainly shows it. He knows his part so well he can get into the mind and become the character himself. I very much appreciated the bonding and dependency of Leporello and the Don that had not occurred to me before.
Malin Bystrom is the brilliant, involved Donna Anna. I was not familiar with her before though I read that she has played this part successfully before. Her performance was right on! Again we can get a glimpse inside this women and watch the formation of the women she becomes during the drama. This is also true of the Elvira of Veronique Gens. I've admired her performances of several French works and she certainly glowed here as the Donna Elvira.
The Zerlina of Elizabeth Watts was great fun. She portrayed the country maid as a clever mature women out for a little fun but also when to stop. I'll never forget her finger interplay as the Don is proceeding to try to seduce her. All the rest of the cast was ""just right"" also.
I wish to add yet another accolade to the director and his subtle use of gestures, facial expressions, roaming finger, rushing hands etc. Don Giovanni is more than just magnificent music, it is a great drama also. This is the disc to buy.",1414281600,10,2882,4.512428298279159
6554882,4,B00M428D06,"Kasper Holten is undoubtedly aware of the complex nature of this colossus of the opera world and is certainly not the first to recognise that Don Giovanni is Don Giovanni - the opera is the man. That's not to say that the other characters in the opera aren't well developed, but Don Giovanni is the driving force for the behaviour of every other person, and it's his actions that determine the whole tone of the opera. A whole lot of room is needed for a figure like this, and Kasper Holten consequently uses the whole of the stage of the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. In Es Devlin's designs, the stage is Don Giovanni, every detail, every colour, every lighting consideration, every stage prop and backdrop are used to express the magnificent monstrosity of Don Giovanni as he is written by Mozart.

The set is a complex revolving arrangement of boxes, compartments, doors and staircases that place us directly in the mind of Don Giovanni. Lighting, colour and projections reflect mood, character and situation.  The attention to the staging is strong, as it often is with Kasper Holten and in the capable hands of Es Devlin, but as with other Holten productions I've seen (Die Tote Stadt, Eugene Onegin), while the spectacle is fully expressive of the music, Holten is not so strong directing singers as actors. All of them are a little bit stiff here and tend to feel like they are going through the motions. By the end of the work, Don Giovanni is shown trapped in a madness of his own creation, but the libretto doesn't really support this idea and it makes the staging of it a little awkward. The problem is that there's not much sense in the direction of a building crisis to what finally drives Don Giovanni over the edge and, unfortunately, the cast aren't quite strong enough to make it work either.

The lack of fire (no pun intended on how the finale is delivered) in the performances is also there unfortunately in the singing. There's a good cast here and they are all very capable in the roles, but with perhaps one exception, there's not much that really stands out and impresses. Mariusz Kwiecie has the looks and the voice for Don Giovanni, and the experience (this performance is his 100th in the role he tells us in the BD extra features), but he doesn't have the necessary charm or charisma to fully inhabit or bring something personal to the role. I've seen Alex Esposito play Leporello a couple of times, and like his Papageno, these Mozart roles suit his style, voice and personality well - more so I think that his otherwise fine work as a Rossini bass. He has a way of getting to the underlying humanity of the characters beneath their comic exteriors. His key aria, 'Madamina, il catalogo  questo' is good, but it's not particularly well directed and as a consequence lacks impact.

The same can be said of Malin Bystrm's Donna Anna. She has character and a good voice, but she's not supported elsewhere.  Her aria 'Or sai chi l'onore' for example is well sung, but with Luisotti holding the orchestra back from emphasising those emotional high points, it just doesn't hit home the way it should. Vronique Gens is the one notable exception to the casting here. She has a great voice for baroque opera and opera seria and has everything that is required for a substantial role like Donna Elvira. She stands out so far above everyone else here however and is in such a different league that she's almost miscast for this production.  Nicola Luisotti must take some of the blame for the lack of drive in an uninspiring musical performance that sails along smoothly with little sense of the dynamic or the darkness that underlies Mozart's score. The fortepiano recitative doesn't enliven matters at all either, but some of the sense of drama is restored by the conclusion, even if the actual staging lets it down here.

On Blu-ray, the High Definition presentation of the performance is superb. Although the stage is mostly in darkness to allow the projections to be effective, the image is clear and detailed. The stereo and surround mixes bring out the colour of the music and singing. The Introduction in the extra features gives a good overview of the production, and there's a little more consideration of the nature of Don Giovanni's women and how Mozart writes for them in another featurette. Kasper Holten and Es Devlin also provide a full-length commentary for the opera. The enclosed booklet has a good essay by William Richmond on the changing faces of Don Juan in literature and film over the ages. The Blu-ray is region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.",1411430400,8,4631,4.73697270471464
6554883,5,B00M428D06,"I've been waiting and watching and hoping that Marius Kwiecien's Don Giovanni would come to Blu-ray since the MET HD and PBS broadcasts several years ago.  But the Met already has a Don Giovanni DVD from several years prior. I was very happy to see this listed and ordered it as soon as I saw it posted on presto. The entire supporting cast is new and Covent Garden set has things in common with the MET set while it's treated very differently. The set is a two-story facade with a centree part that revolves to show interior rooms.
Kwiecien is the star and he is excellent, as are the rest of the cast. A reduced orchestra of mostly modern instruments is conducted with a very light hand. His supporting singers are all first class and the Donna Anna, Malin Bystrom, reminded me of Schwartzkopf both physically and vocally. The Leporello, Alex Esposito is more street-wise than was Luca Pisarelli at the MET.. The action moves along quickly and smoothly and is the best-sung Giovannis I have seen. I'm still getting used to the set but that will come.
Watching this prompted me to pull out the laser disks of the 1954 production led by Furtwangler which has been my reference set for many years. While that set has great singers and any enormous set (Saltburg) and a dose of charm that this set is lacking, you can tell it's 60 years old while the new set is fresh and crisp. If you don't know the names Furtwangler, Siepi, Grummer, Dermota, Della Casa, Edelmann, Berry and Berger, there's a treat waiting for you.
I will not be giving up either of these sets but it is time to do some housecleaning on some of the intervening sets.
The sound here is perfect - a gentle surround on the 5.1 with a good low-end that doesn't call attention to itself.
Every video I have seen of Kwiecien has been excellent, and he has an interesting CD of Slavic Heroes.

8670132,4,B00M428D06,Ma loves these operas from Royal Opera House.  Very nice stage production,1508976000,,73,5.083333333333333
8670133,4,B00M428D06,"A different take on the Don. Some things work, others I just found annoying. The production is non-standard. Nothing wrong with that - there are so many productions out there it is worth trying a different take. The set was quite innovative, although I was trying to work out whether it was supposed to represent a southern plantation, an Escher cube,  or a housing project. The video projections were very impressive technically, but in many places I found them distracting and at times I had the feeling that if I were in the theater they would have given me a headache. In fact, much of this production gave me the feeling of ""look what we can do"" rather than supporting the drama. As for the action, the emotional connections and motivations are unusual and rely on a strained interpretation of the libretto. As for the ending, I was left wondering - is hell an insane asylum, or what?

All that said, this production did hold my interest. Mariusz Kwiecien is outstanding - great singing and his presence propels the drama through the entire opera. The rest of the cast is very strong vocally, although I found a lot of the acting pretty wooden and not really convincing in the interpretation presented here.

This video is worth having, simply for the Kwiecien performance.",1487980800,2,1278,4.747747747747748

8670135,4,B00M428D06,"I enjoyed this ROH production, but there are a few things I did not like, mostly  (1) the projections of Don Giovanni's women's names:  they make Don Giovanni's neighborhood look like a housing project covered in graffiti.  (2)  I much prefer Peter Brook's minimal staging at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence, in modern costumes: if you are updating the costumes, go all the way; updating Don Giovanni to some time around 1900 simply does not look right.  (3)  Zerlina and Masetto are peasants about to get married:  in this version, they apparently get married in the building (housing project?) where Don Giovanni lives;  total nonsense.  Then they disappear, to be replaced at the ball by well-dressed and presumably wealthy people; another nonsense.  (4)  Malin Bystrm* is not a very credible Donna Anna (when compared with Alexandra Deshorties, Edda Moser or Marina Poplavskaya in other productions).  My advice:  decide for yourself; there is nothing wrong with owning several Don Giovanni's.  As for me,  if I had to keep only one, it  would be Peter Brook's production.

Four stars because it is Mozart, but I don't like the staging.

(* Malin Bystrm:  She should practice singing in front of a mirror until she can do it without disfiguring herself.)",1475712000,3,1257,5.04390243902439
8670136,5,B00M428D06,I like opera but I'm definitely not an opera aficionado thus I don't quibble about performers or favored performances.  This Blu-Ray Royal Opera staging is excellent in both sound & visual staging.  I've watched it several times and a couple of times with the screen turned off.  Enjoyed it every time.,1466380800,,302,4.882352941176471
8670137,3,B00M428D06,The subtitles are kinda there at times and others not. which gets a little annoying.,1461801600,,84,4.666666666666667
8670138,3,B00M428D06,"This production is marketed as Kasper Holten's focus on ""the seductive energy of Don Giovanni"" and certainly he has a strong lead with Mariusz Kwiecien who delivers a truly electrifying performance as the ignoble nobleman.  His baritone voice is truly made for the role.  And while his interpretation is a bit more frantic than the famous Dons of the past (Ramey, Morris) who played the role with more smoldering suaveness, given the director's vision, there is ample room for such an interpretation.  The supporting cast is quite good, particularly Alex Esposito's Leporello who has great stage chemistry with Kwiecien.  Es Devlin's digitally-enhanced set is minimalistic and features a multilevel performing spac that changes with the inner-thoughts of the characters in each scene.  I found it to be a bit colorless over the course of the opera, but I can respect the concept.

All in all, the music and the voices are exceptional and the acting quite good. The biggest complaint that I have (SPOILER ALERT) is that the Commendatore's final appearance is so understated that one loses the hellfire and brimstone consequences of Giovanni's despicable behavior.  There are no demons in Holten's Don; only the hell of one's own mind as Don Giovanni is isolated on stage by darkness and paranoia.  Perhaps this is one overlooked aspect of damnation, but from a dramatic standpoint I was thoroughly underwhelmed, both visually and emotionally.

The DVD production is also quite good in terms of film editing and sound quality.",1451865600,,1524,5.137651821862348
8670139,5,B00M428D06,"Don Giovanni is a long opera so you need to expect three hours of enjoyment. Mariusz Kwiecien is one of my favorite opera performers so I was biased from the start. I was not disappointed one bit. The opera was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. The sets take a little getting use to but once you accept that this is not the traditional setting, you can settle back and enjoy the opera, I heartily recommend it to any opera buff.",1444953600,2,438,4.419753086419753
8670140,5,B00M428D06,"There's a lot to savour in this Don Giovanni, starting with Kwiecien's fine performance in the title role.  He brings intensity and vocal strength, along with a roguish charm which makes his seductions believable.  Less intimidating and with less machismo than Keenlyside in the earlier Royal Opera version, he still has enough stage presence to make the thing work.  His partner in crime is very well played and sung also, by Esposito using his physical comedic skills and mobile features to good effect.

To my mind, Donna Elvira is almost as important a character as the wicked Don, and she is beautifully and expressively sung here by Gens, maybe a shade less powerfully than DiDonato in the same role.  This production brings out a certain complexity in Donna Anna and Zerlina.  They are not the passive victims that they sometimes appear, but actively scheme and deceive while trying to get their way.  There might be some overacting here and there but again the singing is luscious.  Don Ottavio is suitably feckless and mellifluous, and Masetto is a grand bully.  Tsymbalyuk's bass in the Commendatore role is thrilling.

The director Holten uses projection effects extensively and mostly to good effect:  though the images are often gorgeous I sometimes found the busy flickering a distraction.  Not all the scenes work equally well.  For instance, the ballroom scene is confusing but not in the right way.  However, with the shadows and numerous doorways mistakes of identity become more or less plausible.  In the end, there are no flames or devils:  DG's torment is psychological and seems to involve being left alone in the dark.  The class struggle aspect is not emphasized as much as in some other versions of the story.  There are some gestures at the idea that DG is terrified by his own mortality, but not too much is made of this.  That is lucky since it isn't in the libretto and besides, being a compulsive sex abuser is unlikely to prolong one's life though it might temporarily take one's mind off of the unpleasant prospect of dying.  Overall a very convincing production and well worth experiencing even if you're not won over by every aspect.",1441670400,,2168,4.887671232876713
