8144155,5,B000I5X7ZC,"In my years of life,  never heard about this movie until last year, I met a gentleman , who really was interested to tell me about the movie. I saw the movie on his house, and REALLY , the movie make sense about the history of Guadalupe Virgen, there is not way to believe that the virgin did appear in Mexico, the movie shows the really more sense accurate with the Mexican reality at that time. After seeing the movie, I understood better what the catholic church prohibited to people to watch it, because other than that the lie about the apparition will be not longer a source of making money, because all of it is about making money. The movie is real truth, the priest who created the idea of creating the apparition was killed by the same leaders church, in order to keep the truth in a secret, was is not longer a secret. Watch the movie, and you will see the truth.",1475193600,,874,4.296969696969697

8144160,4,B000I5X7ZC,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the aspect ratio is incorrect for widescreen tvs, (black bars on top and sides leaves a small window on the center) you need to use the zoom on DVD player or TV to correct for this.
As far as the movie goes: Historically accurate on how the Spanish missionaries Christianized the native Mexican of the 1500s with their own religion, Catholicism. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that in a way the Spanish stopped the human sacrifices to the pagan gods, but do not agree with their method and big lie of the guadalupe virgin apparition which is the main theme of the movie.
Jesus Christ is God and needs no mediators (other than himself), including the virgin Mary which by the way was Jewish, something that is forgotten in Mexico.",1306108800,,772,4.4822695035460995
8144161,3,B000I5X7ZC,"Just in case you're wondering, no, this movie does NOT feature English subtitles. It's all in Spanish with no subtitle options. After 20 years of being banned for its subject matter, it's finally back...but still inaccessible for the non-Spanish-speaking world! Too bad. Shame on Vanguard Cinema for not subtitling this long-awaited dvd release!",1167696000,9,345,5.528301886792453
