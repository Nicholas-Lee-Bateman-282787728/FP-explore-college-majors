7120221,5,B00W4OAMY4,"Great documentary about the DBSM fair in San Francisco and its origins. Takes much of the ""mystery"" out of this particular subculture. Would love to attend some day, just to be there.",1437955200,6,183,4.75
7120222,2,B00W4OAMY4,"Fascinating history, but the writing and production quality were just so so - though the film improved in the second half.  It may be unfair to compare it to Peter Stein's brilliant ""the Castro"", but the contrast is perhaps inevitable. Still, worth watching.",1434153600,6,258,5.0
