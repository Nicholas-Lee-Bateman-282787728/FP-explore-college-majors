The film touches upon psychology, economics, public health, law, and other interesting topics as they apply to the adult film industry.  I certainly learned a lot about the adult film industry, especially the psychology of its performers and employment discrimination, by watching this film.",1493164800,,371,5.625

Prior to watching this documentary I had a limited yet negative view of the porn industry specifically towards the exploitation of women, However, this film offered me a different perspective. I enjoyed the candid personal stories, the human element of porn, and the stigma stars are faced with during and after leaving the industry.
A great documentary worth watching!",1486598400,,479,5.4
8614992,4,B00FES26TG,"Will be using this for my college sex education course.  Interviews people over time to see if their opinion/experiences change in the industry.  It also shows how people can get into it and then find themselves ""self-medicating"" with alcohol or substance abuse.  While it can be dry at times, the video definitely shows a side to the adult entertainment industry that can not be seen by the outside world.",1482192000,2,406,4.855072463768116
