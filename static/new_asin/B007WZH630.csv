5113806,5,B007WZH630,"I got this  DVD in a gift bag at a bechelorette party.  The bride told us she wanted to share her secret for slimming down before the wedding.  I had tried lots of DVD workouts before and always got bored.  But this lady always keeps it real and always keeps it fun!  My core
Is getting ripped!  Just in time for summer!",1338336000,11,320,4.080645161290323
5113807,3,B007WZH630,"the problem I had with this video, is that as an instant video it doesn't give you a menu option so you have to select from the 6 different workouts, you have to just have to play it and fast forward to the workout that you want.  the exercises transistion  very quickly also which I was not a fan of. I suggest watching once to  see the moves.",1407628800,,344,4.029411764705882
5113808,5,B007WZH630,"Great video, especially when you're in a hurry and can only get in 10-20 minutes of a workout.",1405641600,,94,4.277777777777778
5113809,5,B007WZH630,"The workout actually inspires me! The thought that they're only ten minute segments definitely makes me more likely to do them, and it doesn't waste any time!
The exercises are intense, you do feel that you're getting a good workout. Im dripping with sweat when I've finished.
It's not dancy, not too complex to keep up, and I like Amy Dixon's personality.",1397779200,2,356,4.758064516129032
5113810,5,B007WZH630,"I am an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor.  I downloaded this DVD on my Kindle so I could do it every day.  The workouts are very effective and enjoyable.  Amy does everything from a regular core workout to a Pilates abs workout and even a Yoga workout.  Being a YogaFit Level 3 Instructor, I really enjoyed the Yoga part.  The moves are not your typical crunches and really ads some variety to your ab workouts.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone interesting in tightening their abs.  Definitely deserves 5 stars.",1394928000,2,529,4.684782608695652
5113811,2,B007WZH630,"I bought this based on the great reviews,but was not impressed at all. It was very dull and did not offer anything special,as far as Abs moves. The Abs workout segment on Cindy Whitmarsh's new dvd UFit Ultratight is an amazing Abs workout that blows Amy's away. I sold this on EBay along with Amy's new Kettlebell dvd Raise Some Bell,which I really did not enjoy.",1393977600,2,363,4.515151515151516
5113812,5,B007WZH630,"Actually, 6 great abs workouts.  You can do one or more depending on the time you have, or else add one of the 10 minute abs workouts onto another workout.  Some are easier or harder than others, but all will give you a run for your money.",1372896000,3,239,4.0638297872340425
5113813,5,B007WZH630,You can do this workout in 10 min increments if your a beginner or do the full hour if your advanced. She covers every core muscle group. The menu breaks each workout down so you can choose the ones you want to do. I used to do Amy's workouts on exercise tv and loved them so when I read a review on this one I had to have it and am not disappointed.,1364688000,,350,3.808219178082192
5113814,5,B007WZH630,"Amy Dixon is an excellent trainer who offers great variety and new ideas in her fitness sessions.  Everything is fresh & fun.  She is great at explaining not only what you are going to do, but why.  Amy Dixon vs. Jillian Michaels???  Amy Dixon, hands down!  Her sessions are safe and comply with industry standards.  You can trust you will get a fun, complete and safe workout with any of Amy's DVDs.",1362700800,4,400,4.486111111111111
5113815,5,B007WZH630,I enjoy Amy Dixon's 10 minute workouts they are great add ons if you have gone for a walk or run and want to add abs or an arm work out to your exercise.  This DVD focuses on Abs and I like short pilates the best.,1357862400,,213,3.630434782608696
5113816,5,B007WZH630,"Amy Dixon is a great trainer for anyone that's not a ""Gym"" person.  She gives you encouraging words that come across as sincere.",1355875200,,128,4.565217391304348

8522758,4,B007WZH630,"Amy is probably one of the very best out there.  This is a decent program, but I had a few criticisms.  They are:  some of the exercises can be dangerous to the lower back.  Not enough was said about protecting this vulnerable area of the body.  I did not feel there was appropriate warm up or cool down.  I am 64 and have exercised my entire life.  You'll find an aging body can do almost as much as a young one, but must be babied through proper stretching to avoid injury.",1501545600,,475,4.153846153846154
8522759,5,B007WZH630,"Love the variety in this video.  6 different core routines, with several routines using either light weights or a balance ball.  Really fun and easy to follow!",1483401600,,159,4.851851851851852

8522762,5,B007WZH630,"In my opinion, hands down, Amy Dixon is one of the best instructors out there. No wonder she won fitness instructor of the year last year. She is enthusiastic about what she does and she knows what she is doing to help you get fit. I have worked in a gym and have taken many classes. Amy is still one of the best I have ever taken for shaping up or maintaining for women. There are some challenging exercises on here and I workout at home with DVDs 5-6 days. I do mostly Amy Dixon and Jessica Smith because I know I will get what I need in the 50-60 minutes of the whole DVD. She can get you in shape if you are willing to be consistent and eat half way healthy. I can never say enough about her workouts. I only wish I could take them in person!",1464566400,,746,3.98
8522763,5,B007WZH630,Good DVD for the abs.  I enjoy the different styles and the 10 minutes segments.,1456185600,,80,4.333333333333333

8522765,5,B007WZH630,"I love these workouts. They are short (each about 10 minutes) and most give you a full body workout (although, the primary focus is the core). The intensity of most exercises is just right.  Great complement to any workout.",1419292800,,223,4.717948717948718
