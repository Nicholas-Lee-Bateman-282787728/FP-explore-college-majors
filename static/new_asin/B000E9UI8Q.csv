2511644,5,B000E9UI8Q,"I love almost all Shaw Brothers martial arts movies. I've never heard of this one before, but bought it because it starred one of the venoms. It's a great film. Both funny and with a lot of action. Highly recommend!",1361232000,,215,4.4
2511645,3,B000E9UI8Q,"Very good quality and sound, wasn't the bit disappointed. I love Shaw Brothers martial arts films and the production of this dvd didn't take anything away from it.",1357948800,,163,4.857142857142857
2511646,5,B000E9UI8Q,"I am dismayed that this release is only rated 3 stars (as of this writing).  It contains a number of stand-out qualities that separate it from the pack.  For one, the humor is actually funny and not the typical groan-inducing variety.  It translates well and does not detract from the action as is so often the case.  A seamless (and appropriate) blend of action and hijinks.  Second, the lion dance is the best that I have seen on film.  It is engaging and superior to other efforts, like in Martial Club.  Third, the fight between perennial villian Johnny Wang (frequent Venom contributor) and the Qing spy (Chin Yuet-sang) is top notch, one of the best ever, but only the finest among many great fights in this film.  Add to that an atypically bleak ending and you have a very different and satisfying martial arts entry.

I hadn't seen Lo Meng and Wong Yu paired as leads before, but they are just right as the con man (Yu) and the noble everyman (Meng), with superior fighting skills, who get mixed-up in historic intrigue.  There is some disjointedness in the plotting, and the haunted house scene at the end is misplaced, but this is a top-shelf Celestial release.  The Tokyo Shock DVD is crisp and clear, with good subtitles and extras.  I only wish that more of the recent Arc Entertainment releases were of this caliber.  4.5 stars.  A gem of open-hand fighting, fists, kicks, and weaponry.  Don't overlook this!  Bone-crunching action!",1328227200,,1446,4.724
2511647,3,B000E9UI8Q,"The first (and only time) I saw this was when I was a kid watching Drive-In Movie on channel 5 (all NJ & NY people can relate).  Man, it had to be the mid-80s and it had the clumsy US title ""Roar of the Lion"".  Honestly, back then I didn't really like it, even though it was a Shaw production, and it starred Lo ""Golden Arm Kid"" Mang, Johnny Wang & kung fu wiz, Chien Yueh-Sheng (Chien Siu-Ho's older brother).  On TV, it was pan & scan, and I'm sure Larry Bensky had to edit about 15 to 20 minutes off of it's 109 minute running time to make it fit a two hour time slot with commercials.  Also, the English dub just sucks big time (the same voices/idiots who ruined the Eng. dub of classics ""Flag of Iron"", ""Martial Club"" & ""Legendary Weapons of China"").  Plus, I missed the opening ten minutes where a lot of the plot is discussed.  Back then it was incomprehensible, but it did have decent fu and a really cool Southern/Northern Lion dance competition.

Well, let me tell ya something, I'm glad I took a chance and bought this little 1980 gem.  It's amazing what a good transfer can do, kudos to Tokyo Shock.  I've noticed there are three things where Tokyo Shock rises above Dragon Dynasty; 1) great DVD covers, 2) no dubtitles (D.D. has been guilty of this a couple of times), 3) trailer/photo gallery.

I highly recommend ""Lion vs Lion""; first; the movie-great performances (in the Chinese dub), now it makes sense (even though the plot has two sub-plots interwoven with it) and some beautiful (as usual with Shaw) photography.  Second; the fu-great choreography by Hsu Hsia & Chien Yueh-Sheng (as Ching agent Qian Jung-He), who also both wrote & directed this.  It starts off with a bang with a good fight over the opening credits (something I missed the first time).  Even though Yung Wang Yu doesn't really show off his fu, there are two outstanding fights here; Johnny Wang vs Chien Yueh-Sheng & Johnny going toe-to-toe with Lo Mang.  Third; the transfer-crisp remastered picture, widescreen (which benefits the fights), and in addition to the lame English dub, it also has Cantonese & Mandarin audio with remastered subtitles.  No, it may not be a Chang Cheh or Lau Kar-Leung picture, but this works, 3.5 stars. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.",1320364800,4,2262,4.578163771712159
2511648,1,B000E9UI8Q,im a huge kung fu movie fan and bottom line is this wasn't good...i thought it was going to be a classic....after i watched it i threw the dvd in the garbage...nuff said,1311724800,,169,4.151515151515151
2511649,5,B000E9UI8Q,For those that follow the career of the venoms you should already know that Lo Meng is one of the best empty hand fighters in the Shaw Brothers stable. This film spotlights his indiviual capabilites without the other members of the venoms and boy does he ever delivers. This film also stars Wang Yu and Johnny Wang who has a fight scene in the film that takes place in his home with an undercover govenment official that pulls out all the stops. A great addition to anyones library of martial art films in the tradition of the great Shaw Brothers studio.,1178496000,,554,4.4950495049504955
2511650,1,B000E9UI8Q,"the film is okay, but the dvd is a bootleg. The image has simply been stolen from the Hong Kong dvd, and not well I might add. The film is owned by Dragon Dynasty in the US and should be coming out in the next year or so. If you want to support theif and poor bootleg DVDs, feel free to throw your support behind this one. If you have to see the film, get a region free dvd player for $40 and the world is your oyster! You can get most HK dvds of the Shaw Brothers films for around $10 INCLUDING shipping.",1161561600,,505,3.8653846153846154

8107815,4,B000E9UI8Q,"Great movie of Chinese Lion competition.  The main kung fu character was a cop, but was working for a corrupt chief. In not cooperating with the Chief and his son, he was fired.  In his search of another job, he meets a young lady who is carrying a secret package that is of great value supposedly to be handed over to a master of a kung fu school.  It turns out that this master is plotting with a secret organization to overthrow the emperor.  The young lady acts like she accidentally dropped this package with the expectation that the ex-cop will help her deliver the package after she tells him to whom the package belongs.  While the ex-cop searches the address, a scoundrel bumps into him, believing that the package is worth a lot of money, he tries to trick the ex-cop to give it to him.  In the mix-up, they became close friends and started a kung fu school together.

The package was eventually delivered, but fate has it that the new kung fu school competed for the best title and fought against the kung fu school that the package was sent to via the traditional Chinese New Year Lion Dance.  The two lions are from two different regions.  The ex-cop's lion is from Beijing (northern style--gold) and the master's lion is from Canton (southern style--black).  Which ever lion catches the award wins and it was super cool to see two lions fight for the award that gives the school prestige.  Lion vs. Lion is a story of friendship until the very end.  This movie is dubbed in English.",1465948800,2,1496,4.5
8107816,5,B000E9UI8Q,"I like this movie...lol
It's like a kung fu buddy film. Lo Meng is a loyal Ching soldier that is so straight laced it gets him on the bad side of his peers.
He ends up befriending Wong Yu (Dirty Ho!) and gets mixed up in some dangerous hi jinx. Johnny Wang also plays a great role similar in spirit to the one he played in S vs W. Its a good film thought not a great one. The fight choreography is done by a Yuet Sang Chin who is a pretty scary looking dude but a fantastic fight choreographer.

Point of interest...
Lo Meng dissed this film in an interview, claiming that he really didn't know why he agreed to star in it.
I think the film was a flop on release as well. A shame considering it is a fun, funny and ultimately sad film...",1464307200,,737,4.01360544217687
8107817,4,B000E9UI8Q,This movies is a shaw brothers classic. Excellent story line and awsome dragon dance at the beginning.  top notch choreograph throughout entire movie. A must for the martial arts fan .,1431561600,,184,4.935483870967742
8107818,4,B000E9UI8Q,The movie itself is enjoyable with good kung fu action which also showed the differences in Lions from different regions. The video was crisp and the audio clean. The dvd was pristine with no case damage.,1410048000,,204,4.694444444444445
8107819,5,B000E9UI8Q,I can see why Bey Logan said this film is under rated.  No big name stars but great performers and performances in the action sequences.,1407888000,,136,4.44
8107820,5,B000E9UI8Q,"If simply the best kung fu action is what you're looking for, look no further. Lo Meng bring some fo the best lion dancing action footage ever seen on film. The amazing lion dance sequences alone gives this film major historic significance where it's the first time Northern and Southern lion dancing skills are compared. You will be disappointed if you don't add this to your Shaw Brothers Kung-Fu collection.",1401580800,,410,4.871428571428571
8107821,1,B000E9UI8Q,on a personal level did not enjoy this particular movie lot is missing in the movie itself need more action,1392768000,,107,4.4
8107822,3,B000E9UI8Q,The movie could have been better in how it ended so abruptly.  It started of good and the story was reasonable but then at the end everything faded badly.,1388188800,,154,4.310344827586207
8107823,4,B000E9UI8Q,Classic kungfu straight from the studio Shaw brothers. kid with the golden arm turns good and he gets imo one of the better storyline they had. and its remastered!,1377475200,,163,4.655172413793103
