7913532,5,B00000JVSV,"This VHS is aboslutely awesome!!  Challenge of flight crew took their cameras to Russia and filmed some of the most awsome fighters such as Mig-29 Fulcrums, the SU-27 fighters and 3 of the world's most deadliest bombers.  Also watch the Helo's do maneuvers you wouldn't believe.  You can actually sit back..put on a headset and listen to your favorite music while watching this VHS. I call it ""aerial ballet"" just BEAUTIFUL ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL to watch how these pilots manuever these amazing military aircraft!!
A MUST WATCH FOR A TRUE MILITARY AVIATION BUFF!",1135900800,,561,5.076086956521739
