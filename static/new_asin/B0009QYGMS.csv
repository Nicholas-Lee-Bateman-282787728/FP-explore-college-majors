I moved away several years ago and wanted to get back in to yoga so I ordered her CD.  The CD does lack some of the detailed verbal instructions I was hoping to hear compared to the live sessions.  However, I am pleased with the CD overall and I do recommend it for people new to yoga.",1217376000,,475,4.564705882352941
8065464,4,B0009QYGMS,"I really liked this video. In fact, I love the whole series. The beginner video has many of the same postures as the intermediate but the intermediate takes them to a deeper level. Sandy Jones' approach to yoga is caring and careful. The workouts are just right for someone who is beyond the starting stage but not yet ready for intense workouts or advanced postures. Her voice is soothing and her instructions helped me do the postures more easily and with confidence that I was performing them properly.

The cinematography is good but has some minor flaws.",1151884800,2,559,4.762886597938144

for comparison, the poses featured are:

-shoulder rotation

-waist rotation

-hip rotation

-triangle

-warrior 1

-wide legged forward bend

-standing backbend

-standing side stretch

-chair

-squat

-eye exercise

-neck stretch

-sitting twist

-toe stretch

-camel

-child's pose

-hero pose

-meditation

conclusion: I wish I hadn't spent my $$ on this :-(",1138147200,3,624,5.4361702127659575
