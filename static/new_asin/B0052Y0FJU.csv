It's filmed on a freaking FLIP camera, if you remember those from the late 2000s and if all the dead space were edited out this would be a 10 minute film. It would still be bad at 10 minutes but at least I wouldn't be so annoyed. Creep Creepersin is a delusional narcissist for thinking we'd care about him, or his below mediocre film, at all.",1515456000,,461,4.191011235955056
