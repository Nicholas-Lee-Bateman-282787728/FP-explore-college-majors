8133199,5,B000GJ0KJQ,"This is without a doubt one of the finest movies I've ever seen about ice hockey.  I learned things about ""The Rocket"" I never new before.  The actor who played Maurice Richard was excellent.  The hockey scenes were thrilling and I never new the extent of how racist the NHL was to the French Canadian hockey players including Richard who is considered if not the greatest to ever lace up the skates, surely ranks right near the top.  This film is a must for all who love the game of  ice hockey.",1489708800,,496,4.3478260869565215
8133200,5,B000GJ0KJQ,This was a superb movie and the DVD itself was terrific. In exactly the condition you said it was. I thank you very much for a great transaction.,1454025600,,145,4.214285714285714
8133201,5,B000GJ0KJQ,One of the best hockey movies out there.  Never got much mention here in the States (probably because most of it is in French with English subtitles) but it really is a good movie.  Even though it is mostly in French there is a lot of English and it is easy to follow. Movie shows Richard's great determination and drive at a time when French Canadians were hated around the league and in North America in general.  Have watched it many times and my kids (who love hockey) watch it all the time.,1363737600,,495,4.301075268817204
8133202,5,B000GJ0KJQ,I am in Quebec studying French as part of a Road Scholar Program.  Our class watched this film.  I loved the story of family loyalty and hard work.  I was driven to tears by the brutality and slurs that the French Canadian players faced.  It was reminiscent of Jackie Robinson as baseball was integrated. I was happy to learn about this period in Canadian history.,1338508800,,364,4.553846153846154
8133203,4,B000GJ0KJQ,"Many sports fans today recognize the nickname ""The Rocket"" and probably only think of Major League pitcher Roger Clemens. However, long before Clemens was ""The Rocket"" from Montreal.

This movie is a nice tribute to him - Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard - one of the greatest professional hockey players of all time. A lot of people - especially in Quebec - still think he's THE greatest of all time.

For many years, the National Hockey Leauge had just six teams and played 50 regular season games. Richard was the first to score 50 goals in 50 games. He also was on eight Stanley Cup championship teams, including five in a row.

His statistics go on and on but it was Richard's heart, his determination to succeed under adverse conditions and, finally, his stance in sticking up against the bias against French-Canadians in the NHL, that brought him ""icon"" status in Quebec. He is truly a ""legend"" in his country and probably will be revered forever in Montreal.

How much of this movie is fact, and how is fiction, I can't say. If you know movies, you know that many times a lot of it is made up for dramatic purposes. Yet, I think most of it here is pretty much on the money.
The movie overall is entertaining and gives a good insight on what Richard and his peers went through in a biased NHL at that time. The film is as much about the prejudice as it is a biography of Richard.

 The only drawbacks I saw were wooden acting in some spots, too much dumb dialog and some of the action scenes which didn't look as real as it could have been. However, this wasn't a mega-bucks production, so I didn't expect it to look as such. I was very impressed, however, with the wonderful photography in here. That looks big-budget, all the way. Kudos to the cinematographer.

It was fun to see hockey players playing the game as they did in the ""old days,"" wearing no helmets and face-masks and not a whole lot of padding. If you think hockey is a rough sport now, you should have seen it back in Richard's day! You can get an idea watching this movie. There are some brutal scenes on the ice. Seeing Richard punching the referee was worth the price of the rental alone! If you're a hockey fan, or a sports fan who loves history, you have to check this film out.",1237420800,,2249,4.417874396135265
8133204,5,B000GJ0KJQ,"This is a nostalgic look at Maurice Richard--his life, his times, his battles, and of course the wonderful hockey artistry he displayed night after night.  This film highlights some of his most important moments, and is well worth seeing.  It was my privilege to have seen the Rocket play, and it was simply unforgettable.  Now don't get me wrong--I grew up in Detroit watching the greatest all-around player in hockey history, Gordie Howe, play the game the way it was meant to be played, but from the blue line in, nobody has ever equalled the Rocket.  What a treat to view a film that conjures up those memories.",1182902400,4,615,4.666666666666667
8133205,4,B000GJ0KJQ,"I'd been hearing about this movie for the last year or so, it's about the life of former Montreal Canadiens captain and player, Maurice Richard.  My sons and I watched it last night and it was utterly fantastic.  it's about 80% in French and was so good we didn't even notice.  After it was over I said, ""That was as good as 'Miracle'"" to which they replied ""That was better than Miracle"".  In my house that is a huge compliment.  My boys have probably seen Miracle 20 times and myself nearly as many.

Not only did Rocket Richard break into the NHL when he had everything going against him but he broke down walls of racism against Quebecois.  He helped change his sport for the better.

Some actors you may recognize are Ian Laperriere, Sean Avery, Mike Ricci, Vincent Lecavalier.  The acting is top notch, I was very surprised.  The movie did a great job of recreating the hockey style of that era and recreated many great moments that we have seen pictures of.  The special features have a touching tribute to the Rocket and the actor that plays Maurice Richard is overcome while speaking of the Rockets achievements.

If you are interested in hockey or even great sports stories in general, check out this movie.",1166659200,14,1217,4.583333333333333
8133206,5,B000GJ0KJQ,"Great film about a great man in the days where the Anglophones in Montreal

were king and French Canadians were subservient to them. The best positions were held by the Anglos and the non-english speaking French Canadians were expected to understand the language.  Maurice Richard was a hero to the French Majority in Quebec and when he was suspended for the season for the altercation in Boston riots erupted in downtown Montreal.  Most fans felt that the penalty imposed was overly harsh considering that the Boston Bruins player who started this altercation was not given any penalty. Maurice Richard went on to win several consecutive Stanley Cups.",1161302400,6,652,5.074766355140187
8133207,4,B000GJ0KJQ,"Im not into hockey as my father used to be..he used to listen to the
Montreal Canadian all the times, and lucky guy probably saw all the great
players play...Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau and so much more.  Playing
for peanuts in the old days the players had more characters than most of
todays millionaire players.  The only thing i remember from Maurice Richard is
that white hair guy getting standing ovations most of the time he went to
see a game at the Montreal Forum.
Now after seeing this movie and learning more about his life, im amazed what
this guy did and played and what he did for the world of hockey.
Enjoy..",1158796800,11,625,4.473684210526316
