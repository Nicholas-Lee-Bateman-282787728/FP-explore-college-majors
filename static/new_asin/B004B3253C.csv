8421351,5,B004B3253C,"Leaves you asking yourself and your friends ""What would you do in that situation?""

I watched this movie because I've become a fan of Diane Kruger in the 2013 TV show called The Bridge and I was interested to see what else she acted in.  I'd never heard anything about this movie before.

However, I was almost immediately invested in the story line, the acting was excellent (especially Dermot Mulroney) and the plot moved at a very quick pace.  I was genuinely surprised by the climatic scenes and did not feel I could predict which choice he would make.

Now I want everyone I know to watch it so we can all talk about it and what we would do if we were in his situation.  You know what the moral answer is, but would you be able to make that decision and live with it?",1377734400,,772,4.2534246575342465

8421355,4,B004B3253C,While it's not the best movie I've seen it was actually interesting.  Fairly fast paced though scenes that go from past to current can be confusing.  Bought it mostly as an actor I've been a fan of for over 40 yrs has a small part in it but don't mind having this movie in my collection.,1302825600,,287,4.107142857142857

8421357,5,B004B3253C,"INHALE is a fine little gripping drama from writers Walter Doty and John Clafin who based this timely tale on a story by Christian Escario about the extremes to which people will go to when terminal illness takes the mains stage of their lives. It is a very dark story but survives becoming morbidly dreary by the sensitive direction from Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur and a strong cast.

Paul Stanton (Dermot Mulroney) is a successful attorney married to Diane (Diane Kruger) and they have one child Chloe (Mia Stallard) who suffers form a terminal pulmonary disease.  The family's life is driven by love but also by the fact that Chloe needs frequent emergency trips to the hospital because of her tenuous hold on life.  Paul and Diane are finally told Dr. Rubin (Roseanna Arquette) that the only choice they have for saving Chole is a lung transplant. Paul searches the methods for finding an entry into this overcrowded demand for organ transplant and when he discovers that a powerful man James Harrison (Sam Shepard) received an illegal heart transplant in Mexico, Paul sets out to find the source.  In Mexico he discovers just how crime-ridden is this area of 'sales' and persists until he uncovers a doctor Navarro - a code name - in the person of Dr. Martinez (Vincent Perez).  The hideaway compound where the illegal transplants are performed is surrounded by poor people and gangs and the one person that helps the desperate Paul find the source of illegal organs is a kid who befriends him.  When a 'donor' becomes available, there is a decision that Paul must make, one based on human kindness and compassion balancing with his won desires to deliver lungs to his daughter.

Mulroney is particularly excellent in this tough role and the gamut of emotions is staggering.  And the remainder of the cast, including the gifted Jordi Moll&agrave; in an important cameo, is superb. The film is intense and disturbing but successfully explores the little known world of illegal organ transplantation.  Another fine feather in the cap of Icelandic director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur!
