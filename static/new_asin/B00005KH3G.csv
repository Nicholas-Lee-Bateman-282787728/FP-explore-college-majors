1619909,3,B00005KH3G,"I bought this hoping to see a film of the broadway show.
 This isn't it.  As mentioned in another review, some of the best music has been dropped, and some songs that are kept are changed (at least from the OCR).  Worse yet, the songs that replace the originals are always worse than the originals.
 I enjoyed Didi Conn in her role, and the reset of the cast did a credible job.  If I didn't know the OCR so well, I might have enjoyed this a lot more, but as it was I was disappointed.",996192000,,485,4.063157894736842
1619910,4,B00005KH3G,"This film version of a long running Broadway show is fun from start to finish. The illusions are all great. The levitation on the water jets is truly baffling. Even for a person having a knowledge of magic, these illusions are wonderful. The whole cast seems to be having a great time doing the show and it comes across.
Doug Henning is a delight as he was in his TV specials, but is given more of a chance to let an audience get to know him in the sort of silly story that surrounds the illusions. Anita Morris doesn't have a lot to do, but is a very sexy ""glamorous assistant"". Seeing Mr. Henning and Miss Morris makes a viewer slightly sad since they are no longer with us.
Didi Conn is a comic delight as Doug's unappreciated assistant. She has two delightful songs - ""Lion Tamer"" and ""Where Did The Magic Go"".
Comparing the musical numbers in this film to those on the original Broadway cast recording, some numbers have been replaced by new ones for this film. While none are ""showstoppers"" or that you will be humming when the show is over, they do contribute nicely to the over all fun of the piece.
There are no ""extras"" on the DVD and the sound is a bit fuzzy in a few places during the musical numbers, but the whole show is so much fun that these faults can be overlooked.
Once a Broadway show has closed, usually they live on only in sound recordings and the memories of those who saw them, so it is great to have a film of this Broadway hit and a lasting memory of Mr. Henning and Miss Morris.",996105600,23,1507,4.2727272727272725
1619911,2,B00005KH3G,"I saw the show on Broadway twice, once wtih the original cast and again later. This is not a movie of that show.  I saw this on video several years ago and it's dratically different from the play/musical.  Lion Tamer and Charmen's Lamentand the Goldfarb Vairations are gone (the best numbers in the show) and several illusions have been replaced wiht stuff from Doug's specials, to the detriment of the production. IT shows off some good magic, and tells the same basic story, but if you're looking at a bit of history of the original show, you are going to be disappointed.",996019200,2,574,4.617647058823529
1619912,5,B00005KH3G,"I am presuming here that this DVD will be a copy of the film that was shot in Canada and never released. The film is great, shot over a couple of weeks of performances with some new routines that never appeared in the original stage show. The film was directed by Sammy Bayes who also directed the stage show in Australia.  Anita Morris is delicious and Australia's Jon Finlayson re-creates the role he made famous here in OZ. Larry Anderson played the role of the magician.  Doug Henning is well... Doug Henning... and who could complain about that. One of the great TV magicians who also did something valuable for the theatre. He should be remembered for not only this stage show but for draging magic into the 20th century. Others have capitalised on the TV genre but Doug was amongst the first with the prime time TV specials, lets not forget that. There are new songs and the show is a delight from start to finish especially if you are a magic afficinado or, like me, have been in the production. I worked with Jon, Sammy & Larry in the Australian production in 1975. Thanks goodness we can finally get to see this gem......",990316800,19,1131,4.512195121951219
1619936,4,B00005KH3G,"I didn't really want this DVD but since it was filmed as a live stage production, I bought it for my collection.  I was surprised when I watched it.  It was really good!  It's not a show I will probably watch often as the story was weak, but it had some really special moments I liked.",1394236800,,285,4.053571428571429

1619938,4,B00005KH3G,"We all miss Doug Henning and his marvelous, eye-boggling magic tricks.  He died far too young, but his mystique is here, with wonderful feats of wizardry.  The book for this Broadway show is bad, but it tries to hold together the episodes between magic acts. The songs by Stephen Schwartz are good, but not always done to the best advantage, and Didi Conn is adorable in this one.  But the whole event belongs to the beguiling, wondrous Henning.",1383523200,,445,4.67948717948718
1619939,5,B00005KH3G,"DOUG HENNING was not with us long enough ..the late young magician with the  modern stage look not only did  television --but also wowed Broadway with this ""live"" show. Here it is edited a bit, and with a beautiful streamlined assistant, but ALSO with all the extra  magic illusions added. A sensational show..if you HAVE not seen this, be ready to feel you are in the audience on Broadway aS DOUG and his charming assistants keep you guessing, laughing and wonderfully entertained. All magicians everywhere love this. I pretty much guess.. You will also.",1376697600,5,555,4.882978723404255
1619940,5,B00005KH3G,I saw this Broadway show as a kid.  It was on my birthday and it was one of the greatest memories I had with my dad.  My dad died young at 52 and I believe Doug Henning was around the same age when he passed also.  It brought back so many memories and as a kid I was fanatical about magic and I loved Doug Henning.  I'm glad I got to see this again after all these years.,1371600000,4,371,3.717948717948718
1619941,5,B00005KH3G,"I saw the Broadway play as a child and was mesmerized.  Doug Henning helped shape my gateway into the world of performing magic over 30 years ago.  This DVD does NOT disappoint.  Might not be the best for people who must have all the original songs, but for me, it was all about the innocence, positive vibes and magic of Doug Henning.  Love this DVD - Thanks Amazon!",1359763200,,367,4.352941176470588
1619942,3,B00005KH3G,"This CD is weak, compared to the live performance of the original script. At least the one used in a performance I viewed in Atlanta Georgia in the early 80's. And the original Broadway recording? Come on guys! What were you thinking when you put the The Magic Show title on this collection, or let me say thrown together piece.

Yes the lights are brite on Broadway, but now on The Magic Show CD. Wasted my money on this one.

No Name",1353888000,,435,4.2926829268292686
1619943,1,B00005KH3G,"I went to see The Magic Show on Broadway in 1974. It blew my little 9 year old mind. The  magic was fun, the show was pretty sexy (hey, it's all relative) and the songs! The songs were amazing; catchy, singable, fun, playful, funny, and memorable. So much so that I immediately bought the record, and listened to it endlessly.
Now, many many years later, and not really being a fan of musicals in general, I still have a soft spot for this show, and tellingly I STILL remember the songs. Most notably ""West End Avenue"" and ""Solid Silver Platform Shoes"". I tried to find a CD from the original show and struck out. I tried to buy the favorite songs on iTunes-and struck out. In a fit of generosity, my girlfriend bought me this DVD. Now I realize that The Magic Show is not an all time classic, but this totally lame, stripped down, bare bones, several years later remade for the screen, version absolutely stinks. The songs are uninspired and most importantly-my two favorites are not even on it. This DVD is not worth 99 cents let alone 10 bucks.",1310947200,2,1047,4.453125
1619944,5,B00005KH3G,"I've never seen the original Broadway production, but this was great!  I had always been an admirer of the late Doug Henning & his magical performances!  The ""Johnny-come-lately's"" can't hold a vanishing candle to him!",1298592000,,218,5.2
1619945,4,B00005KH3G,"I saw The Magic Show on Broadway as a kid, and I never thought I would have a chance to see it again.  While this version of the show is not identical to the one that played on Broadway, it is still worth seeing.  The story is basically the same, but some of the illusions have been switched.  For example, Zig Zag and The Chinese Sticks are not in this version, but other illusions were added.  A musical number or two was changed, too.  The show looks dated -- very mid-70s to mid 80s, but the magic is terrific.  It is also an indelible example of Doug Henning, one of magic's greatest performers.",1296345600,2,600,4.265486725663717
1619966,1,B00005KH3G,"This is the WORST DVD I have ever had the misfortune to view

1619967,5,B00005KH3G,"Doug Henning was one of the greats when I was growing up. I remember how he raised the bar by being un-convential in dress and performance. The ""hippy"" magician!!",1290384000,,162,4.620689655172414

1619969,1,B00005KH3G,"I saw the original national tour of this production, love listening to the soundtrack when it came out, and wished I'd read more reviews of this DVD adaptation before purchasing. All of the changes that were made to the show for this filmed version are regrettable. Stephen Schwartz, the composer must be regretting them now. How can you cut the best songs from the show? That's like ""Annie"" without ""N.Y.C."" The actors seem misdirected into making huge, over-the-top (ala bad children's theatre) acting choices, not that the book's material gives them much else to choose from! It's uninspired and highly disappointing.",1250899200,3,620,5.148514851485149
1619970,4,B00005KH3G,"I remember when this work was in production. Then wondered why I never got to see it. I saw Henning in the broadway production and was enthralled.

When I heard of the video version of the show I was dismayed at all the negative remarks... I watched it tonight with tears in my eyes. Certainly, there are magical elements that shouldn't be there and it is missing musical elements that should be. But to see Doug Henning again, to see that magic is more than just trick photography, this show truly is MAGIC.

How could I have waited so long.",1236124800,2,542,4.41
1619971,4,B00005KH3G,"Doug Henning is one of the best when it comes to magic. He had a style that was unique and unpretentious. He mixes Broadway with Magic. It's also helpful that he has the beautiful Didi Conn, of ""Benson"" fame, to assist him. His skills as a magician are only surpassed by his skills as an entertainer.",1224806400,2,300,4.375
1619972,5,B00005KH3G,"It was overwhelming to see the magnificent (and adorable) Doug Henning again. I saw The Magic Show several times on Broadway, and although this is not identical to the New York production, it was quite a trip back in time to another era. I must confess that seeing Doug Henning perform brought a tear to my eyes. What amazing things might he be doing today if he was still with us?

Doug Henning is a legend, never to be forgotten.",1182816000,4,431,4.3875
1619973,4,B00005KH3G,"A true flash back to the sixites.  Doug was truly an amazing Magician and his place in Magical History has been secured.  If you enjoy Music, Magic and Broadway Shows then what are you waiting for?  This DVD is really a Classic and should be on your shelf!",1178409600,2,256,4.291666666666667
1619974,5,B00005KH3G,"Yo have to love this.  Doug, God rest is soul, is the one of the reasons so many magicians are magicians today.  He brought Magic to brodway and this dvd shows that show.  Classic Henning@",1171238400,4,188,4.314285714285714
1619975,5,B00005KH3G,"Well, if I had listened to the negative reviews I would have missed a wonderful ride of personal emotions of great joy to deep sadness.  I didn't see the Broadway show, but I did see a touring show in the late 1970's, when I was 17.  And of course I watched all of the prime time specials.  Why are they not out on DVD by now?  For some reason, despite or because of, I'm not sure, the chipmunk looks and tacky 1970's costumes (what were we thinking), I was enthralled by the illusions and Doug's contagious enthusiasm for the Wonder of the universe.  I actually followed him into his transcendental meditation phase, but that is another story.  I guess TM is no match for liver cancer.

When I first saw Doug on the DVD I found myself with a smile as big as Doug's and tears of joy in my eyes.  It was like seeing a lost friend.  A feeling of great joy came across me.  At the very end of the DVD the performers are shown behind the curtain giving hugs and kisses, then the picture freezes on Doug with that great smile, tears came to my eyes as I held back an emotional upwelling that would have left me sobbing uncontrollably (I'm a guy so we should not do such things), as I know that Doug had died and we are left with a great loss.  Well, that is just me, and a few million of his fans.

The first time I saw, actually heard, the DVD, was in my car on a long trip by myself.  My minivan has a DVD player but only the back seat passengers can see the screen.  So I only received the audio and I had enjoyed it so much that I replayed it three times, then spent some time skipping to the best songs over and over.  I liked it even better the third time around.  The story and dialog are way too simplistic, but I really enjoyed the songs, though I had missed West End Avenue, my favorite song on the Cast Recording, which I have on vinyl and I haven't listened to for about 15 years (time to get the CD).  But I really like the new songs, and sorry, I never really liked Solid Silver Platform Shoes anyway.

The DVD show has a sort of prequel, showing the cast out of character doing a song and dance and Doug doing some illusions, fading into the main show which takes place in a night club.  The prequel choreography made me laugh hysterically; very corny, reminiscent of those horrible TV episodes of The Brady Bunch when they would sing and dance, very embarrassing if not for them, then for me.  Was this choreography on purpose for it's comedic value or were they seriously thinking this was how to dance?  I think they were serious, making me cringe even more.  Better to close your eyes as the music is very listenable.

The main show is entertaining even if it does have a very weak storyline and the dialog is very simplistic.  But, of course, the star of the show is Doug and the illusions are great.  DVD's allow for slow motion and replays and, though, recently I could use TiVo to discover how some illusions were done on America's Got Talent, I could not do the same for Doug's.  Doug's torn newspaper trick is genius.  And where did he hide that lion, and visa versa, Anita, in the cage, and it wasn't such a friendly lion at that.

I think any fan of Doug's will enjoy seeing this production.  The negative reviews were not about Doug.  Watch it for the illusions, and for the memories of Doug, and keep a sense of humor about the production.  If you like the music, then that is a bonus.  This is not a mega-production of the 1980's (a la Phantom), but it was nominated for best musical direction, so it must have set some standard for production at the time.",1158451200,6,3581,4.2514792899408285
1620006,4,B00005KH3G,"The musical has a simple story line but sure captured some of Doug's best magic. It's great to see the combination of music, dance and magic together in one show. For that price you can never watch a musical so make a purchase and have some fun with The Magic Show starring Doug Henning.",1099440000,4,287,4.333333333333333
1620007,2,B00005KH3G,"I was thrilled when I found out this had been released. Although I had not seen the original production, I know the score well and have performed several of the songs in cabaret and couldn't wait to see the entire production. I know the chances of ever seeing/doing this in community theatre are slight at best. Apparently, I still haven't seen it. The biggest dissappointment is the omission of ""Goldfarb Variations"", ""Solid Silver Platform Shoes"" and (in the ""what were they THINKING?"" category), ""West End Avenue"". It was, however, delightful to see Doug Henning and the incomparable Anita Morris again. Henning's important contribution to the world of illusions is well represented here, and gives a fun reminder of what the 70's were like. I still love this score, although I will forever put my money on the Original Broadway Cast recording. This is a good DVD to have for a collector, but don't expect too much. The story is inane, the jokes vaudevillian, and the acting merely adequate. Nonetheless, how nice to occaisionally see a forgotten show come back to the surface, huh?",1023840000,17,1085,4.934426229508197
1620008,1,B00005KH3G,"I thought this would be interesting, with some good magic by Doug Henning, but it turns out to be rather boring. Couldn't get myself to watch it straight through without using fast-forward.",1023235200,2,189,4.9375
1620009,1,B00005KH3G,"This is not really the MAGIC SHOW that had a long run on Broadway.  Many of the songs have been changed, and while the new ones are pleasant enough, none is as sophisticated or interesting as the one it replaced.
To me, the biggest problem are the sets and costumes.  So ugly, so cheap looking.
As the divine assistant, the late Anita Morris is great.  Didi Conn is fun and adorable, though vocally thin.",1023235200,5,404,4.4324324324324325

1620011,1,B00005KH3G,"If you are getting this DVD because you have great memories of the Broadway Show, adored the score, and have generally been waiting for this to turn up, please, please save your money.
West End Avenue is missing, the Goldfarb Variations are missing, Charmin's Lament has been changed beyond any recognition.
The actor playing Van Syskind is adequate, I guess.  Didi Conn (who I love, btw) is fine.  Anita Morris is great, but has been hamstrung by the changes to her character.  Doug, well, what can I say, Doug was a great magician and it's wonderful to see him perform.
And, **perhaps**, if that's all you're looking for..great magic and the one (Lion Tamer) or two (Up to His Old Tricks (although the arrangement is not as good)) hummable songs they've allowed to remain, then maybe you won't be stunningly disappointed that you spent money on this disc.",1004400000,12,857,4.777027027027027
1620012,2,B00005KH3G,"Well...I wish I could say that I really liked this DVD, but I can't.  Loved watching Doug Henning again...some amazing magic, even though his basic tricks were ones we've seen over and over again.  That's all the good news I could find in this filmed performance.  The book by Bob Randall is hideous.  The jokes almost always landed with a thud, and the story line is ludicriously thin.
The supporting cast was serviceable with nobody at all standing out.  Didi Conn is very likeable, but she seems like a chimpmunk on speed.  Anita Morris barely registered, even though her vocal register was incredible, and she spent much of her stage time bi-sected.
Doug Henning was very stiff, as you could see from the opening choreography where he wasn't sure what hand move was next. Even his trademark delivery of his magic tricks seemed somewhat uncomfortable at times.  He ended each trick with that ""ta-da"" jump, a great big smile, and his jumpy eyebrows as if to say, ""How about that?""  He cannot act at all.  He does make up for that, however, with sheer enthusiam, energy, and brilliant sleight-of-hand magic.  That all having been said, David Copperfield and Penn/Teller owe a lot to Henning's break through style of the seventies.
But the biggest question of all is ""What happened to the score?""  Stephen Schwartz's enchanting score from the Broadway Cast recording is far from brilliant, but fun to listen to.  This ""cutting"" of the show destroyed much of the fun.  What good can you say about this show when the best song in the score, ""West End Avenue"" is nowhere to be found.",1001808000,3,1580,4.743589743589744

Many a day (and evening) I sat in the Cort theater fascinated by Henning's magic and Schwartz's music. Now could this production, filmed live in 1981, capture all the magic of the Broadway production. In a word.....YES!!!  Although some of the Music is different and only two original cast members remain(Henning amd Anita Morris as Charmin)This production is alive with the same good feeling as the original. Didi Conn brings to the role of Cal, Hennings assistant and wannabe girlfriend, the same spunkyness Dale Soules had on Broadway. Some of the original music is gone (West End Avenue is replaced by Where Has the magic Gone? and Solid Silver Platform shoes gives way to We're Gonna Need a Magician)but the new songs carry all the zestyness Schwartz is famous for.
