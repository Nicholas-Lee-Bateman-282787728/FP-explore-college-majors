4014310,4,B002ZCDT0O,"I was surprised that this was a Bollywood movie, little reminiscent of Harry Potter.  However, take note that my kids (8 and 10) had a hard time following the subtitles since the dialogue is a little faster.  The actor that plays Aladin makes up for any of the shortfalls in the other characters, I think I will probably pay more attention to movies that he is in.  Also, this is not your Disney Aladin.  He is a present day Aladin that find the lamp in modern times.  There are some parts of the plot that are a little questionable such as what exactly is the ringmaster and his relationship with the genie and what is the deal with the scientist.  I like the plot that occurs between the ""wooing"" of Jasmine also.
When I streamed from my computer there seemed to be breaks in the frames (slight), but from my Kindle (my laptop ran out bettery mid story), the quality was pretty good. Generally, if I watch a Bollywood Movie, it is one of the cheesy love plots, but this was pretty good ""hero"" type of story.  The plot and storyline is not the strongest and but it is an enjoyable movie.",1322784000,,1088,4.356435643564357
4014311,5,B002ZCDT0O,"This movie takes the Aladin fairy tale and modernizes it.  The Bollywood method with music and dancing, the love story, action, drama, and everything you can possibly fit in, really works in this movie. I expected the movie to be closer to the actual fairy tale, but I enjoyed watching the modern version.",1320537600,3,305,4.754716981132075
4014312,5,B002ZCDT0O,"My daughter and I watched this movie today: AWESOME! English subtitles were spot on! Like how English was integrated in the movie. Music: awesome! Comedy, little romance, action, and great music and dance makes a wonderful movie! Will be watching again! I will not go into a long review explaining the movie. Some reviews that I have read about movies, give way too much info and tends to give away the movie.",1305936000,2,409,4.694444444444445
4014313,5,B002ZCDT0O,Bacchan (As the genie Genius) and Dutt (as the evil Ringmaster)are two seasoned pros at the top of their form. This movie is a delight from start to finish. Much better than a lot of the garbage Hollywood is barfing up these days as entertainment.,1305763200,,247,4.511111111111111
4014314,5,B002ZCDT0O,"This movie takes a classic fairytale, and gives it a delightful Bollywood twist-- with all the dazzle and beauty one has come to expect of these movies.
The music is fun, the characters are relatable and the costuming is magnificent.

A must see for anyone who loves a fun, wholesome musical!",1301443200,,292,4.7254901960784315
4014315,5,B002ZCDT0O,"I got to admit I was kind of skeptical about it. I mean it's in subtitles but from a completely unknown company to me. But everyone's review on this movie were just positive so I thought why not. I must say the story and modern retelling is just unbelievable. Aladdin in this movie feels  human and really down to earth. I got to admit even the singing was pretty catchy and I'm against musicals in my movies that I watch. Definitely good for the whole family good amount of action, comedy, as well as drama. Disney could learn a thing here. I strongly recommend this to anyone that is even curious about it to just check it out. You will be quite pleased with this film.",1295049600,14,671,4.325396825396825

4014319,5,B002ZCDT0O,"I stumbled upon this (and came back a second time) at a theatre in suburban Maryland.  We were the only couple in the theatre both times.  I guess, like most foreign films, it hadn't been reviewed in the local papers and, because it was a foreign film, it wasn't getting any walk-in business.

What a shame!!!  This film is so much fun on several levels.  Great music, great acting, pretty-good-to-excellent special effects, and some insight into the effects of western pop-culture on Indian pop.

I would go back to see it a third time!",1261094400,29,537,4.659574468085107

4014324,5,B002ZCDT0O,I thought it would be the story that I grew up hearing. but this one is different. real bad guy  trying to get the lamp and a nice guy trying to get the girl. Get some popcorn and candy for this one.,1400803200,,199,3.738095238095238
4014325,3,B002ZCDT0O,...boring. The effects were great and the storyline promising but the movie dragged on and was a bit boring. It's worth the low-cost rental but you won't be blown away.,1400544000,,168,4.633333333333334
4014326,5,B002ZCDT0O,"I really enjoyed this movie, so much that I purchased it. It's the story of Aladin but done in a different way and Amitabh Bachchan was  awesome as the genie.",1385424000,,158,4.266666666666667
4014327,4,B002ZCDT0O,It was a good attempt to recreate the Aladin story.  I like it very much.  I recommend that you watch movie.,1384300800,,108,4.095238095238095
4014328,3,B002ZCDT0O,"The movie was colorful and the musical numbers were nice but this was not the typical A.B production. His character was not established well and the storyline was convoluted and it rambled on.  I've watched it twice and still can't under stand the role of the evil genie. The special effects were pretty good for a Hindi movie but overall, somewhat disappointing.",1377734400,,363,4.854838709677419
4014329,1,B002ZCDT0O,I didn't like the fact that it was not in my language and the story line did not make up for that. all in all it was a waist of time,1370649600,,132,3.2903225806451615

4014332,2,B002ZCDT0O,"Great visual effects, famous actors, beautiful settings but script was not good. I wish they hired a proper screen writer instead of planning the movie storyline on a kitchen napkin. Could not watch till the end.",1364601600,,212,4.916666666666667
4014333,5,B002ZCDT0O,saw it on netflix a couple years back and the kids loved it even my lilttle one who was four at the time and could not read the subtitles. The music is so wonderful and fun. My fav is you may be.,1361664000,,195,3.6666666666666665
4014334,5,B002ZCDT0O,My husband even enjoyed this movie. It is a great take on the Aladin story. Amitabh Bachchan is wonderful in the part of the Genie. So is Sanjay Dutt.,1361145600,,150,4.206896551724138

4014339,2,B002ZCDT0O,"- It's a musical film and beautiful.

- The songs and dances are upbeat and dance inspiring.

- The costumes are attractive.

- The acting is okay.

- There are some humorous scenes here and there but not much. For example, the scene where Aladin came to Jasmine's martial art class.

- The plot drags in many scenes. If the movie was 90 minutes long instead of 130 as stated on the back cover, it would be better.",1341964800,,414,4.256410256410256
4014340,5,B002ZCDT0O,I actually wanted to see this because I adore Amitabh Bachchan AND I have always loved the Aladdin story.  This is great re-imagining of that concept.  Truly wonderful to watch...Enjoyed it immensely!,1339718400,,200,5.21875
4014341,3,B002ZCDT0O,"There's a fleeting shot here of a guy who has a blade plunge into his face, so while ALADIN for the most part does pass as a children's movie, there are one or two moments to watch out for. This is Bollywood's adaptation of that classic Arabian Nights tale, and Disney shouldn't fret and fear competition. Not when the Bollywood genie emerges and we learn that his name is... Genius. As a play on words, this kinda sucks.

This time out, a Bollywood picture exhibits special effects that are on par with Hollywood's. The most disappointing thing is that the screenplay fails to take advantage of the nifty bells and whistles. ALADIN opens with such promise but then, half an hour into it, degenerates into routine Bollywood escapism.

Aladin Chatterjee (Riteish Deshmukh) has lived in Khwaish all his life. He's an orphan and one of them sad sacks, so passive that he's allowed a childhood bully to continue abusing him. Apparently, that gag where Kasim (Sahil Khan) and his gang force Aladin to rub lamps never gets old.

The plot thickens when a beautiful new student named Jasmine (Jacqueline Fernandez) arrives at Aladin's college, and on his birthday. The ever-enterprising Kasim organizes a birthday party for Aladin to impress Jasmine. Kasim convinces Jasmine that Aladin would love a lamp as a birthday present. The mortified Aladin accepts the gift and Jasmine coaxes him into rubbing it. That does the trick. Cue the Big B, Amitabh Bachchan, looking very dapper in an assortment of fedora hats and flashy suits.

There's an impish side to Big B which has always contrasted with the regal demeanor he exudes on screen. He unleashes this playfulness with this role. Nothing says over-the-top like a rapping Amitabh Bachchan (it's weird to hear him say stuff like: ""I got the shorties jumpin'""). Thankfully, he doesn't try to match Robin Williams' frenetic energy. As Genius, Big B pesters Aladin to come up with three wishes and soon, lest Genius' genie contract be extended for another million years.

I like Riteish Deshmukh. He's a natural at playing these put-upon roles, and he certainly pines with the best of them. The problem is that his character is such a limp milquetoast that it's frustrating. And the three wishes he makes? I had hoped that the writers would introduce a new twist with the wish-making, but that doesn't happen. Aladin pretty much wastes his wishes on the same thing. And that's the problem with the film. It looks gorgeous. The CG stuff is neat. But I expected more from the cast. The story beats are staged in dull fashion. There's a low point in the film in which Genius, in accord with tons of Indian cinema heroes, demonstrates proficiency with martial arts. Given, there IS a cool factor in seeing the Big B kick butt, but it just smacks of lazy writing. Jacqueline Fernandez is new to the game but I wish she had more to do than just stand there looking stunning and glamorous. The romantic arc oozes familiarity, and the story doesn't at all convince me that she really could fall for Aladin. Except for Aladin's (but, really, Genius') serenading of Jasmine in ""You May Be,"" I wasn't feelin' the musical numbers which came off as strident and trying too hard.

There's a parallel plotline concerning an evil ex-genie who styles himself ""The Ringmaster,"" and he's played at low simmer by Sanjay Dutt. The Ringmaster plans on regaining his magical powers and he means to do this by catching the reflection of a comet which only passes over Earth every million years. He's toadied up to by a crew of freaky circus performers (which I thought was a nice, colorful touch). Not too surprisingly, the Ringmaster has something to do with Aladin's being an orphan. Would it surprise you to know that Genius was also involved?

In the end ALADIN isn't a bad film; it could've been better. Here's Indian cinema catching up to the rest of the world in terms of its filmmaking technology. I feel that a bit more effort with the script would've produced a much superior story and would've drawn out better performances from the cast. But the kids will probably like it, anyway. And I did love the acknowledgement boom which you hear when Aladin makes a wish. That's another nice touch.

This is a 2-disc set. Disc 1 has the film (with options for English sub-titles and to jump directly to the musical numbers). Disc 2 has the following bonus features (total running time: 01:08:44 minutes):

- Making of ALADIN (cast & crew conducting interviews mostly in English)
- Making of the Songs
- ""Giri Giri"" Music Video
- 2 Theatrical Trailers
- Visual Effects Showreel",1327881600,2,4594,4.783102143757882
4014342,5,B002ZCDT0O,"I picked this film to introduce my almost 8 year old to foreign films. He loves Studio Ghibli but all those films were released in English in America. This is English sub-titled and that is the type of film most of the foreign films I watch are. I wasn't sure what to expect but saw the good reviews and one reviewer mentioned it was family friendly.

So we gave it a shot and boy are we glad we did! It had a little something for everyone! And it completely enchanted my son, who quickly got over the fact that he was having trouble reading the quick moving subtitles and fell under it's spell. When his dad called he told him that most people might find the Disney version to be good but that ""the one with actual humans is way, way better! And they speak another language which makes it even cooler."" I second that! If you're looking for a good date movie, a good family movie or just a good movie period look no further! We will be adding this to our collection. And now I think I have to have my son's father watch this too, with a little hint that my birthday is coming up.",1325980800,3,1079,4.1875

8384530,4,B002ZCDT0O,It was so fun watching it. I loved the music especially in the first third quarters of the movie.
