8268393,5,B00183MECU,"Instead of the over-violent or glamorised view of some modern Russian films, a nostalgic and true to life story told skillfully!",1392681600,,128,5.142857142857143
8268394,5,B00183MECU,"The vanishing empire is a story about a young man who has everything going for him, and a penchant for screwing it up. He meets a great girl in university but being a good looking charming guy he's tempted by other women everywhere he goes. He is also tempted by alcohol, drugs and debauchery.

You watch as he confidently winds his way through life as if he's invincible, but drastic events change his outlook on the choices he makes.

This film is certainly Russian, and like a lot of Russian literature it's very personal and introspective, and focuses mostly on what's going on inside the protagonist's head. But it does attempt to introduce the politics of the era and how it affects him and his friends.

I definitely enjoyed it, it has a good mix of humor and thought provoking moments as well as a glimpse into Soviet Russian culture at the time. It's not as fast paced as some would like, and drags on in spots but overall it's very well done.",1332720000,,952,4.491329479768786
8268395,3,B00183MECU,"A fruit of Soviet internationalism, eighteen year old Russian teen Sergey Narbekov of a one-parent Moscow family much financed by not-healthy-wealthy-grandpa, well inherits genes of his presumably Uzbek father, visualized both in heartthrob appearance and behavioral patterns of early awaken sexuality while mingling with high-aiming Kostya and very average not-so-well-hilled Sasha subtly consuming creativity and funds of his brighter friends.

A story of young men's friendship in a golden era of a Soviet epoch the Brezhnev (then S-G of the Communist Party and a factual ruler of the USSR) reign was and their outcomes in post-Soviet Russia of 2006 is, perhaps, highly overestimated both contextually and as an art-work, also beautiful artists added much to a rather segmentally-constructed visualization.",1309996800,,809,5.798319327731092
