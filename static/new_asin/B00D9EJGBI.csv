5784013,5,B00D9EJGBI,"IMAX 3D effects spectacular, great for showing off your 3D TV and liquid crystal 3d glasses. You can watch over and over. 3D sound great also.",1390435200,,142,4.5
5784014,5,B00D9EJGBI,We skipped the 3D version since folks said it had problems.  Information was good and well presented.  Graphics were great.  it did get off topic a bit... but still interesting space facts.  Really enjoyed. Have watched several times.,1386979200,,234,5.078947368421052
5784015,4,B00D9EJGBI,"Interesting educational facts of the junk floating around us , 3D effects could be better and definitely outclassed if compared to the 3D effects of GRAVITY if the forthcoming DVD release is as good  as the theater release !!!",1384214400,,226,4.794871794871795
5784016,5,B00D9EJGBI,"This DVD was interesting, and 3D made it pop. I had seen parts of it on various TV shows about space. It's incredible how much junk we have put up there. If we keep leaving junk in space, it will be too dangerous to launch anything any more. Some of it in high orbit will take a hundred years to re-enter and burn up due to orbit decay.",1383264000,,336,3.9558823529411766
5784017,2,B00D9EJGBI,"Coming in at 38 minutes makes this one of the shortest documentaries that IMAX has released on 3D BD.  In my opinion the 3D in the movie is not worth the 3D label.  I've seen better computer generated 3D on IMAX films like Legends of Flight.  The computer generated graphics here are sort of bland and do not stand out. None of the 3D here stands out though.  It's an interesting movie subject wise but if it had better 3D, I be drawn to see it again.  As it stands I have no desire to see it again.",1380153600,12,499,4.051020408163265
5784018,3,B00D9EJGBI,"I'd like to start by saying the movie presents its somewhat complex material in a fun, easy to follow format. The graphics are informative and easy on the eyes. In fact, I had bought this movie in a 2D format, I would have rated it much higher.

Unfortunately, having paid extra for 3D, I expected some ""pop."" Even on an 82"" screen, the 3D was lacking enough that I checked my glasses several times during the film to make they were still working.

My bottom line is that if you buying this solely for the documentary, I doubt you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a 3D experience, I say you need to look elsewhere.",1379462400,21,623,4.408695652173913
5784019,5,B00D9EJGBI,Great DVD about a big problem that only the satellite people talk about.,1460678400,,72,4.615384615384615
5784020,5,B00D9EJGBI,A good look at the stuff circling the earth.,1456876800,,44,4.0
5784021,4,B00D9EJGBI,I enjoyed watching.  It talks alot about satellites and junk we put in space. Very informative. If your looking for 3d that comes out of tv then this is not for you. It is also pretty short.,1456012800,,190,4.135135135135135
5784022,4,B00D9EJGBI,Wish it was longer.,1446595200,,19,4.0

5784025,1,B00D9EJGBI,"JUNK is more like it.  Had I know this 3D movie would comprise itself primarily of computer generated graphics and not using authentic images from spacecraft sent to planets in our Solar System, I never in a million years would have made the purchase.  Granted, to the viewer who is interested in factual data then this is right for you, and needless to say the theme is alarming, but I am not a child who enjoys Disney cartoons as I outgrew them over 50 years ago.  Not literally Bugs Bunny type cartoons, as I actually like Bugs, but a vast majority of the movie is literally computer generated graphics and not the best quality.

For example, when I write ""not the best quality"" I mean when the Director/Producer/etc. want to show an image of Earth for example with Space Junk the Junk graphics are mostly just circles colored in.  And yes, I said what I said.  Literally, round circles that have been colored in and the viewer is expected to use their imagination so when you view a ""dot"" moving around the earth you had to imagine what debris may look like.

Even if when the movie was created pictures used to depict Space Junk was an image of a broken computer board, or a broken window hatch or anything you could possibly accept as being Space Junk, anything would be better than watching filled in circles orbiting Earth.  When there were other scenes to show a specific class of Space Junk then what you saw was simply a different geometric shape and that is it.

To give credit, there was some real Mars footage and I don't understand why images from NASA and JPL were not used.  We landed probes on Mars and orbited celestial moons orbiting around other planets, but then again low quality computer generated graphics.

Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.  New customers, please read the reviews and exercise prudence prior to purchasing.  If not, you may be the next one to write a similar review.

I wish I didn't have to submit this type of review, but Earth Being's needed to know what they were getting into.

5784034,5,B00D9EJGBI,"The 3D experience is awesome.  More important, is the explanation of how we are making space uninhabitable for future generations of manned and unmanned exploration and use.  How will the future survive without weather, communications, navigation, and imaging satellites?

5784037,3,B00D9EJGBI,"OKAY, only because the 3D doesn't deliver. The subject matter is very interesting, and considering movies like Gravity, I was expecting to see a more professional rendition of ""junk in space"". There is depth, but many opportunities for 'pop' are just bypassed likely in the interest of production schedules and money. A great subject should have a great presentation...definitely missing here.",1407110400,,393,5.459016393442623
5784038,4,B00D9EJGBI,"good presentation and sort of good effects, worth having to build up a collection, i do like it but the other nasa 3D videos are better",1392249600,2,135,4.230769230769231

8590865,4,B00D9EJGBI,Great sense of depth although a lot of CGI was utilized for the space related features. The information presented is interesting and relevant. Some interesting ideas on how to tackle the necessary cleanup of older satellites still in orbit and how to manage future satellite decommissioning.,1483056000,,291,5.3478260869565215
8590866,5,B00D9EJGBI,watching this documentary video of about 30 minutes.........a length of viewing .......is suitable to avoid dizziness which some 3d viewers experienced.  Most 30 minutes 3d from Imax are good to buy.  Check it out.,1478649600,,214,5.264705882352941
