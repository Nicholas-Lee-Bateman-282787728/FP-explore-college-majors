7331859,5,B011A8X3O0,"A heart-touching, well-written movie, as the story played out you began to understand what plagued the main character and why she was so damaged. I would recommend this movie!",1485734400,,175,5.068965517241379
7331860,4,B011A8X3O0,"This is a story about a young woman- Bellisima McCain returning home to care for her abusive father, who is now on his deathbed. Bellisima must now deal with her dark past in order to move forward. The story started off at even pace and created a level of suspense when Bellisima travels home and begins to have flashbacks about her parents violatile relationship, and the abuse her younger sister suffered. As the movie progresses, secrets are revealed, as Bellisima rekindles her friendship with Jeremy Spencer who has a dark past of his own.

The movie is slow in spots, which I feel is a result of weak subplots in transition. In particular, the love interest with Jeremy, and when Bellisima travels back and forth between her hometown and the city she used to work in. However, the acting is strong enough to carry the overall theme of the story.",1482105600,,851,4.673333333333333

7331875,4,B011A8X3O0,"Several months ago I saw a preview of this movie and put it on the list of movies to watch. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I'm a  fan of Macy Gray and that was already a star in it's favor. I must admit I wasn't prepared for this story to hit so close to home for me. Because it was so close to me I was glad to see the story didn't preach forgiveness and instead was true to the expectations of ""duty"".",1462060800,,411,3.7790697674418605
