7992906,4,B00009RXLJ,it was all right but i love the other steve austin the bad ass one.  this video was entertaining and great though with a lot of history about him,1402012800,,145,4.0
7992907,5,B00009RXLJ,"finally I completed my stone cold dvd collection and have every single dvd about him ever made even the old VHS's seeing his early matches are really awesome because on this dvd you can learn so much more about Stone Cold then on the other dvd's like the newer one's monstly ect.. this is really a great way to see his early years because before he got that neck injury he was an awesome wrestler, he had it all till that neck injury and even then he still became the Stone Cold we all know today, everyone can say what they want about who's the best, but the truth of the matter is and Vince even says it on mostly every dvd he mentions sales in, that NO WRESTLER even comes CLOSE to STONE COLD MERCHANDICE RECORDS or whatever they call it..Hulk Hogans record for merchandice was shattered by Stone Cold, its 2014 and you still see countless people with AUSTIN 3:16 shirts on, still old groups of buddies getting together to watch a good ol night of some attitude era.

Really dvd's are the only way to enjoy true wrestling cause now its all pg, directed at an entire different audience and even though they say its a ruthless aggression era or whatever, its not, its a pg era a kiddy era that is literally only designed for little kids.",1395878400,,1238,4.359307359307359
7992908,1,B00009RXLJ,"I just recently bought this dvd to see Steve Austin in the early years. It wasn't worth the time and money, I remember watching Steve Austin in the 80's when he was young but this dvd only had 4 matches and they were not good at all. The matches were lame as all get out.",1331596800,,271,3.9454545454545453
7992909,5,B00009RXLJ,"Brian Webster and ""Mr. USA"" Tony Atlas provide between match commentary for this episode of Classic Superstars of Wrestling.  Atlas promises ""some of the finest matches ever performed in the history of professional wrestling.""

1. Steve Williams (Steve Austin) vs. The Punisher (The Undertaker) - A very green Steve Austin takes on Mark Calaway, who was being pushed as a monster heel, in what we are told was his first match.  Syndicated television filler.  Punisher wins with a leg drop.

2. Steve Williams (Steve Austin) vs. The Medicine Man (Chris Youngblood) - Austin's teacher and mentor Gentleman Chris Adams provides special color commentary for this match.  Note: Except for the outfit and occasional ""war cry,"" Youngblood appears to have affected what fans will recognize as a ""Samoan"" gimmick.  Adams spends the match hyping his professional wrestling school and video tapes.  Youngblood wins with a buttsplash from the top rope.

3. Steve Williams (Steve Austin) vs. Gentleman Chris Adams - Student versus teacher.  Austin wins by DQ when Adams beats him down with brass knucks.

4. Steve Austin, Jeff Gaylord, Gary Young and General Akbar v. Jeff Jarrett, Bill Dundee, Eric Embry and Percy Pringle (Texas Tornado Toughman Match) - Odd ball rules: An eight-man tag match -- but when one team gets a pin, they get to pick a member of the other team to attack -- on four-on-one -- for one minute.  Then the solo wrestler has 10 seconds to answer the bell.  If he gets up, the eight-man match begins again.  Austin's team lost when Akbar was down for the 10-count.

5. Steve Austin (and Jeannie Clark) v. Chris Adams (Toni Adams) - Cat fight starts off the match.  Order is restored when the ladies are barred from ringside.  Adams wins with a top rope clothes line.  Austin beats Adams down after the match.  Clark then beat Adams and Toni with a kendo stick.

6. Steve Austin and Jeannie Clark v. Chris and Toni Adams (Mixed Tag Match) - Cat fight before the bell. The ref restores order and Austin and C. Adams start the match off, exchanging European uppercuts, rear chin-locks and sleeper attempts.  The ladies interject themselves and then chase each other around the ring.  Both thrill the crowd by slipping and falling in the same puddle of beer.  Austin tagges in Clark who mounts her ex-husband.  C. Adams then ties Clark into the ropes and tags in T. Adams.  Catfight.  Men tag in and C. Adams superkicks Austin over the top rope.  Back in the ring C. Adams locks in a Boston crab.  Another catfight that spills out of the ring.  Percy Pringle holds T. Adams while Clark takes shots at her.  Chris Von Erich attacks Pringle.  Iceman parsons then attacks Von Erich.  C. Adams then uses a chair to clear the ring.

Webster and Atlas then thank us for joining them.
