1930765,4,B0000E1WKD,"The Toronto gig is excellent on the whole. It features a nice variety of Foos songs. They perform them with real energy. The acoustic gig in Washington is also good. I have to say, however that I wasn't too keen on the Slane footage. I didn't like the swtiching between two screens, but thats just my opinion. If I had been in charge of the DVD, I probably wouldn't have bothered with the Reykjavik 'audio only' performance, and would have put in some other performances from different places, with audio and visual footage, but this doesn't mean that the audio from Iceland doesn't rock.
I thought, also that they might have taken the alternate bridges and outros in Toronto a bit far at times. I guess they probably did this deliberately, seeing that they knew they were filming their DVD. I think Dave perhaps screams a bit too much as well. This does, however create a more raw feel to the concert.
There are two songs that, for me, stand out as being left out from the DVD: My Poor Brain and This Is A Call. But for a band with four albums they really have done well to squeeze in a good selection (we even hear Weenie Beenie).
It was perhaps a bit of a shame not to see any 'roadwork' (which is done very well on the Red Hot Chili Peppers Greatest Videos DVD) or band interviews. There is a nice photo gallery, though.
All in all, although I may have dwelled on the negatives a bit, if you're a real Foo Fighters fan, I would recommend you buying it.",1085356800,,1456,4.356617647058823
1930766,5,B0000E1WKD,"I felt like I was THERE.  I even got other people to purchase it who were also with me at the store where I purchased it.  I have to say I haven't finished ALL of it yet because I loaned it to my friend and her husband and they don't wanna give it back!
I watched it on a HUGE TV with total surround sound and you could hear it from 4 houses away.  But you can't help it because as soon as you put in the DVD, the concert STARTS.  So you get into it right away. None of this waiting around with your remote control for the DVD waiting to press the select and play buttons, etc.  Like I said, it was like we were there.  The camera work was very good as well.  The close ups on Taylor and lengthened and/or alternate versions were at times ""mesmerizing"".
Anyway, I have always loved the band, now I do even more because they seem to really care about what fans want, and they delivered just that!  This is my new favorite DVD!

1930767,4,B0000E1WKD,"Someone had said the recording was bad.  Hmmm that shocks me because it is pretty good especially when you listen to the CDs
Overall I liked it very much.  The toronto concert and the acoustic versions are the only ones I'm refering to on this disc. The recordings on the Iceland show wasn't as good and it was audio only, but the toronto show gave you the whole concert and it was a good recording",1079654400,,398,4.293333333333333
1930768,4,B0000E1WKD,"The Toronto show has great sound, and gives you a good example of what the Foos are doing live these days.  The DC segment with acoustic rendetions of a few songs has both great video and sound.  Actually, all of the normal ""shows"" are great, but the cool thing about this DVD are the hidden goodies.  You may have to try playing it on your PC to find them all, but there is a great story about and live performance from Nilfist, a band from Iceland that the Foos stumbled on while dining out the night before their show.  There are a couple of other small hidden film clips here and there.  Good stuff!",1079308800,,603,4.254385964912281
1930769,5,B0000E1WKD,"I really do not understand the all the negative reviews being posted.  I believe this concert DVD nails everything into a great package that I find myself watching over and over:
1. great set list
2. incredible musicianship
3. great mix (stereo and 5.1)
4. great camera work (makes you feel like you're there)
Above all, Mr. Grohl and Co. appear to be having the time of their lives and truly seem to appreciate their fans.  The feeling is, and always will be, mutual.  Rock on.",1074211200,16,478,4.534883720930233
1930770,2,B0000E1WKD,"I like just about every Foo Fighter song.  They are talented musicians and songwriters.  They also have a showmanship that is exciting.  Okay, I'm saying all of this before I say that the quality of the DVD was low in comparison with most any other music DVD that has come out in the last several years.  Did the team that put this together check with the band first?  I think not.  The songs are great, but...  Compare it to the likes of Linkin Park (live in Texas), Dave Matthews (live in Central Park)???  I'm sorry and disapointed that there is no comparison in ""sound quality"".  I am looking forward to the next DVD from the Foo Fighters and will buy it anyway.  But, have your Quality Control check it out first.",1072742400,3,718,4.412213740458015
1930771,5,B0000E1WKD,"If you haven't seen the Foos in concert but love their music or you just want to see them again, This is a great DVD. It includes music from all their albums and shows them in concert from around the world. It has 3 hours of foo footage from different places, a photo gallery, and more. It includes all their hits and some of them acoustic in Toronto. It's the greatest concert I've seem on DVD or TV except their $2 bill concert in Philadelphia. It shows their concerts from the eyes of the Foo Fighters and the Fans. If you feel like listening to a live album, just put this on your TV and listen. This is a must for any foo fan.

1930772,4,B0000E1WKD,"Well, I'm proud to say that I was a part of the Toronto show but sadly I couldn't find myself. Even being a big fan of them, I think for some reason they could've done better or maybe it was just me anticipating a really wicked dvd to buy. What should've been done is the audio concert of it should've been recorded on a normal cd so that ppl like me could listen on the discman and on the move. The ""hidden"" stuff in the dvd were hard to access on the pc, but I managed to get it done. Songs that should've been included are This is A Call, Walking after You and The One (Toronto performance). Otherwise, its alright overall.",1069977600,,626,4.139344262295082
1930773,3,B0000E1WKD,"The Good:
1. It's the Foos.  2. It's 3 Hours of the Foos Live  3. It's a cheap DVD considering the content  4. It's worth the asking price just for the acoustic section alone!
The Bad:
1. The 5.1 Mix is horrible and make's Dave (Grohl) sound like he's singing in the bath (Stick to the Stereo track)  2. Half of the content is an ""audio only"" concert which covers nearly all of the same tracks as the video content, which is a disappointment!
The Unforgiveable:
1. After waiting so long for this DVD, i'm left feeling it could have been so much better  2. It doesn't convey the raw power and joy of seeing the Foos live, due to the soundtrack.
These coments may seem harsh, but when you see DVD concerts such as Joe Satriani live in San Francisco, then you know what could have been.",1069804800,10,783,4.263513513513513

1930825,1,B0000E1WKD,I love the band but the audio quality was miserable. It sounded like it was recorded from the back of the hall with a hand held low-end camcorder.  Maybe I got a defective copy?,1150848000,3,177,4.205882352941177
1930826,5,B0000E1WKD,"If you like Foo Fighters you will love this DVD.

If you want perfect vocals or a technically flawless performance, don't waste your time here (or any real live show for that matter).  But, if you want a great live experience on DVD this is where to look.  The set list is great and you can really feel the audience exude energy.

The audio only concert included should be treated as a bonus since the Toronto conert is the primary draw.  You can't really knock the band for packing the DVD full of content.

Highly recommended.",1148083200,4,528,4.447916666666667
1930827,4,B0000E1WKD,"This dvd is one of the best dvds i own now. I loved the Toronto concert. Anyone that has this dvd, whatch Taylor Hawkins on the song ""Monkey Wrench"". He does one of the best solos i have ever seen. The only diapointment I had was the other places were only slide shows with pictures in the background. Iwanted a concert. They also didn't put a backstage scene where they talked to the band. Overall, I feel this dvd is GREAT!!!",1145318400,3,427,4.283950617283951
1930828,3,B0000E1WKD,"It is good.. but I wasn't impressed.... at times Dave's vocals are sub-par and the intensity of the music is lacking.  I enjoyed watching it, but I was not impressed.",1141689600,,166,4.533333333333333
1930829,5,B0000E1WKD,"This is one of the best DVD's I own now.  It's not just like a DVD, think of it as 2 foo concerts on DVD & 3 on audio disc with a slide show... it's just great, i can't express it any better.

would you like curly fries with that?

1930830,3,B0000E1WKD,"Foo Fighters albums a lot of times tend to have good songs mixed in with some blah songs. So a live DVD tends to solve all those problems right? Well not really. After so many shows, you'd think they'd work the crowd and the set a little better but I guess not.

The main feature I guess is the show they did in Toronto. I have a couple issues with it: 1) the setlist is too damn small. It's 15 songs. Even U2's Elevation shows have at least 20. Pearl Jam had like 30 or something. Where's I'll Stick Around or Big Me or Walking After You? 2) While he's an awesome drummer and good songwriter and even a capable vocalist, live he kind of needs work. For one thing, he does too many ""ready, ready?! WAAAHHH!! By the 2nd song after you've heard it so many times you're like shut up dude, but it keeps doing it! It practically ruins my favorite part of set opener All My Life when in the studio he carries the last word of the chorus, here he just WAAAHHHH!'s it. And probably my absolute favorite Foo Fighter song Aurora is on here yet he doesn't belt it out like I would on disc. The catchy as hell ""on and on and on and on"" part at the end is so jumpy and full of stops it's hard to get into it.

There's also 2 more sets with some acoustic stuff, disappointingly most of it already on the Toronto show. Then there's the audio-only version of the Foo's first time in Reykjavik, Iceland with the music only having being heard while a slideshow is played. First of all, there's no video of it and 2nd of all it's practically the exact same set as Toronto, only adding 2 songs and changing the order a bit. Can't maybe do something else?

If you're hardcore into Foos get this but for non-fans, hm, I'd say go for it but don't say I didn't warn ya.",1128643200,2,1745,4.1415929203539825
1930831,5,B0000E1WKD,They sound awesome live and you get much more than just listening to a cd,1123545600,2,73,3.933333333333333
1930832,3,B0000E1WKD,"This is a very good DVD, a well-rounded selection from the Foo's first four albums, and the fact that the disc starts right into the concert footage is great.  The music is fantastic and, in particular, Taylor Hawkins on drums is just about perfect.  The only real weakness is, well, Dave Grohl's voice.  Let's just say his voice in studio and on the individual albums is great.  Out of studio and on stage......ummmmmm, not so good.  To listen to him try to belt out 'Aurora' at the Toronto show.....ugh.  Painful stuff.  You could almost believe they pulled some random dude out of the crowd and let him try to sing it.  I love this band, I will always love this band and will buy whatever album they ever put out, but I think I'll pass on the live stuff.",1120608000,2,757,4.39568345323741

(Some of the above songs are played acousticly; I have marked those that I remember being acoustic, including the acoustic-only Washington, D.C., show.)

I knocked off one star for a few reasons, partly because of the confusing ""opening"" title menu; I only saw it until after I finished playing the main live Toronto concert, not when the DVD first loaded.

It also would have been nice if the Reykjavik show (which is audio-only and has just a slideshow with pictures of the band) were also included in MP3 or a similar format. I doubt many people will play the DVD just to listen to the music without the video, so the ability to load it up an iPod or burn it to a CD would have been very nice.

Also in the Reykjavik show, when I select to play ""Hey, Johnny Park!"" the DVD plays ""Low"" instead.

If you like the Foo you'll likely enjoy all the live content on this DVD despite my few qualms with it. The songs on this DVD thankfully draw from all four Foo Fighter albums, and the band's energetic performance makes it a treat to watch and listen to.",1092614400,46,1871,4.368876080691643
1930834,5,B0000E1WKD,"Foos are much better live than in studio, and it's about time they released a live DVD.  Over three hours of music.  I wish the Iceland show had video too, but meh.  What are you gonna do?  Instead it displays still photos like Led Zep's How the West Was Won.  The Toronto show was awesome, as were the other two.",1086134400,2,313,4.15

8001668,4,B0000E1WKD,"If you love the Foo, then this DVD gives it to you.  Tours everywhere with bonus footage at the end.  Not as well shot as some of their more recent dvds, but the sound is great and it is well worth the purchase.",1327968000,,211,3.883720930232558

8001670,3,B0000E1WKD,"If you're a long-time fan you've probably already seen it, but for newer fans who want to see some live footage of the band, this is obviously required viewing. The setlists include material up to their fourth album, One by One, and covers their entire career up to that point. The performances are typically top-notch and energetic, and Dave interacts well with the crowd in his usual style (although yes, his voice isn't at its best here).

The main drawback for me, which doesn't seem to get pointed too often, is that the band will draw out the bridges of some songs (such as Learn to Fly) by mixing things up, jamming, and riffing.

While impressive in some ways, there are times it completely sucks the energy out of the crowd. Everyone anticipates the band building up to a rousing finale of their popular numbers, and instead the band just sorta keeps droning on. And on. While the band's new spin on old songs is interesting to listen to at first, esp Taylor's drumming (and it all makes one wish they'd show some similar ""freestyling"" creativity on their newer albums), it gets terribly boring upon repeated viewings.

Their 2006 acoustic ""Skin and Bones"" DVD is a much more enjoyable performance, but naturally it can't match the energy of a regular rock concert, and one of the main appeals of the band is that energy. For another option in that department, you may want to look into the band's recent Wembley Stadium concert DVD.",1220054400,,1442,4.691699604743083
8001671,4,B0000E1WKD,"First for those seeking info on the extra Video Footage...

There are two I am aware of...

1st Bonus:

In the Washington set, during the 3rd song, ""For All the Cows"" (or choose it from the Track List and play it), you should spot a ""DC"" in the bottom right corner of the screen just after Dave Grohl is saying ""you have to choose your battles"" and something about ""Neil Young"", at the 35 second mark of the song.

That is when you need to hit enter on your remote. When you do, you will be treated to a rendition of the hit My Hero from the Colour and Shape Album.  The Quality isn't great, but hey, it's a bonus!

2nd Bonus:

35 Minute Video of Dublin Concert

Go to the main menu and select ""Slane Castle""
On Next Menu, hit each number shown, only after the RED ARROW reappears...then You'll get the 35 minute Dublin Show.

Press 3 and then enter, wait for the red arrow to reappear and then,
Press 8 and then enter, wait for the red arrow to reappear, and then...
Do the same procedure for the rest of these numbers...2, 5, 4, and 6.

What about the DVD as a whole?  Well, ok it's not the best at points, the sound isn't always great, and certainly Dave grohl's voice is shot during most of this, (they should have gotten him on film much earlier in the tours), but you know, in the end, it still works!

I was lucky enought to see them in Glens Falls NY back on Octoer 2007 just before the did Saturday Night Live, and less than a month after releasing ESPG ALbum.  If only there was footage from that show!  His voice was in fine shape and it was awesome.

8001673,4,B0000E1WKD,"Navigating this DVD is confusing as hell.  Aside from that, the music is great, video quality is excellent.  Audio on DC and Slane is awful...it's like someone has turned the volume up to 11 on a bad little boom box.  All in all, though, it's jam packed with good Foo stuff.

DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THE ""BONUS"" CONCERT?  I was copying the contents of the DVD into iTunes so I could view it on my iPod, and I found and extra section on the disc containing 35 minutes of concert footage in Ireland...Dave's got a button-down green shirt on, and he keeps talking about The Hives in between songs...the footage is not mentioned or listed anywhere on the DVD's menu, and not accessible using a DVD player, or DVD playing software on the computer...it's weird.",1155427200,9,754,4.555555555555555
