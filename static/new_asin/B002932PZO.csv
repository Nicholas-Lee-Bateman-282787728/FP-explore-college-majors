8357465,1,B002932PZO,"the movie would have been enjoyable if the star (ron o'neal...who i love) had not ended up losing his woman...sheila 'superfly' frazier (she winds up being murdered).  hated the way they never called her by name after she died and only referred to her as ""that girl"".  ron also appears to be in somewhat poor physical condition at the close of the movie. not a good look at all for such a handsome hero. a hugely disappointing ending for some fans (like myself) who want all of ron's movies to finish with him as a slightly battered (only slightly) invincible hero with his loving woman at his side.  i can't really deal with any movie where ron o'neal doesn't come out a winner.  i must say though adolph caesar was quite amusing in his role as the fight promoter. he was outstanding actor.",1405987200,3,791,4.510489510489511
8357466,5,B002932PZO,I rate this five stars love all the superfly movie actors and actress. Another greatest movie Ron O'Neal made wish he been the greatest and wish he was still alive. And he will always be the greatest actor of all times. Please Amazon put this on instant prime video thank you.,1394323200,2,276,4.431372549019608
8357467,1,B002932PZO,I found this film very disappointing and quite frankly boring the picture quality of the disc is not very good as it has not been  remastered although it is just as well it really wouldn't make this disappointing film any better it may have the stars of superfly but it sure is no superfly Sheila frazier didn't really have much to do apart from the sex scene although to be fair that's basically all she really had to do in superfly as well it just it was a better film this film is really only for watching if you have trouble sleeping don't waste your money,1393459200,,560,4.283018867924528
8357468,2,B002932PZO,"This movie what can I say? Cast is good, storyline could have been better. Adolph Cesar stole the show for me, this is no Superfly. It could have easily turn to be a comedy. It's ok not something you want to rush to see. If you are a Ron O'Neal fan you might like to see something else he did but I see why this slipped under the radar.",1325548800,3,336,3.8840579710144927
8357469,5,B002932PZO,"I own this movie it is one of ron o'neal finest movie at the starts of the movie with him walking in the middle of the road with a certain type of jacke looks like he came from somewhere people don't want go, when you see the jacket  you'll know, but anyway he play's this hustler who thumbs his way into town with nothing but a bag,pool stick & two bombs(FIST'S) he carries around at the end of his arms and walks into this whole in the wall and the action begins, i will not tell you no more details you have to watch it yourselves you want be disappointed",1265932800,8,558,4.072727272727272
