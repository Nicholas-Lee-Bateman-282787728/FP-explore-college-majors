1635193,4,B00005NKTH,"First, this IS a review of the VCI version -- different versions may have different merits, but I believe the VCI version is very good, and the extras included make it worthwhile.  I put this on the backburner for a while, and when I watched it last night I was pleasantly surprised.  This probably won't appeal to modern/younger audiences, but those who collect and appreciate Hammer films or the classic horror films will find this of interest.

The film transfer is excellent, as is the sound.  The plot is different than you might expect and I'm afraid other reviewers have told you too much.  However I do agree with the reviewer who said perhaps this will put off people from ""investigating"" satanism!  Another film in rather the same vein is ""The Devil Rides Out.""

There is an interview with Christopher Lee that is dated after his role in the Lord of the Rings movies and it is fascinating.  He lambasts the British film industry and I think the interviewer was kind of stunned by his amazing anecdotes (and his powerful indictment of British film-making).  I'm sure if you enjoy classic horror this will be a worthy addition.",1096934400,8,1135,4.720812182741117
1635194,5,B00005NKTH,"The 1960 British film ""City of the Dead"", or as it is more popularly known in the US as ""Horror Hotel"", has finally been given the deluxe DVD treatment it deserves. I have seen this film countless times since I first saw it on television back in 1966 in numerous edited versions, and in varying degrees of quality. Made on a modest budget, similar to the Val Lewton chillers of the 1940s, it has remained one of my all-time favorite horror films. Stage actress Patricia Jessel (she won a Tony Award for the role of the duplicitous Christine Vole in Agatha Christie's ""Witness for the Prosecution"") plays Elizabeth Selwyn, burned as a witch in Whitewood, a New England village in 1692. Selwyn made a pact with Lucifer prior to her death, placed a curse on the village, and has indeed returned from the dead, running the Raven's Inn (guests check in, but don't check out!), and, basically, all of Whitewood. The citizens of the creepy, run-down village, with the exception of blind Reverend Russell (Norman McCowan) and his granddaughter Patricia (Betta St. John), are all witches, so the place isn't exactly a big ""tourist draw"".  Enter shapely blonde co-ed Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson, daughter of director John Stevenson and actress Anna Lee) who has come to Whitewood to write a term paper on witchcraft, upon the recommendation of her professor, Alan Driscoll (a suavely sinister Christopher Lee). Miss Barlow checks into the Raven's Inn, and becomes a sacrificial victim of Ms. Selwyn and her pals on Candelmas Eve. A subsequent investigation of her disappearance, led by her brother and boyfriend, along with the assistance of Patricia Russell, leads to a hair-raising climax. The film is chock-full of horror movie cliches, but they work! Dark, film-noirish photography, loads of fog, cobweb-filled catacombs, run-down graveyards, they're all here, and they are simply perfect. This film is practically a style source for Goths! Douglas Gamley's musical score (a hybrid of horror movie meets Gregorian chant, with some jazz passages thrown in) is catchy and memorable, and the actors' performances, particularly that of the ""heavies"" (especially Ms. Jessel), are good , making for a very entertaining and satisfying 78 minutes. VCI has gone right to the source, the original British print, and has restored 2 minutes of footage that have been unseen in American prints, and that's only the beginning. The picture quality is superb, tho maybe a tad grainy in spots, and is presented in widescreen format. The sound quality is good, nothing spectacular, and then there are the extra features! Interviews with director John Llewellyn Moxey, Christopher Lee (that's ""Sir"" Christopher Lee now!), and Venetia Stevenson, talent bios, a photo gallery, the original American teaser-trailer, and fun art and graphics add immeasurably to this love letter DVD to a well-made, genuinely creepy film. If you are a fan of classic horror films, this is a must-own. If you are an aspiring horror-film maker, this is an excellent textbook example on how to make a well-crafted, tight film on a modest budget.

1635195,5,B00005NKTH,"Christopher Lee has been an amazing actor, and in the twilight of this career at over 80 years old he is still doing fine work in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Star Wars II and III(coming).  However, most of us grew to love his body of work back in the period of Hammer Studios heyday.  Hammer, to lovers of horror, gave us some of the greatest film.  Cheap on budget, high on quality, they gave you fun from vampires, to outer-space monster to witches.  Directed by the marvelous John Llewellyn Moxey, Horror Hotel was it's alternative title.
Chris Lee is Professor Alan Driscole, in Massachusetts in the US, and he is teaching a course on the witchcraft burnings of a near by town called Whitewater, similar to the Salem hysteria.  A student, Nan Driscole, is looking to do more in-depth research, so Driscole suggests she travel to Whitewater and sends her to stay at an inn there on her winter vacation.  Raven's Inn is run by Mrs. Neils, a friend of Driscole, and she welcomes Nan though says the hotel is closing. Nan learns a witch, Elizabeth Sewlyn. was burned on the spot where the inn stands.  Newlis is a strange woman and it quickly becomes apparent there are dark doings at Raven's Inn.  Nan is welcome for reasons Nan knows nothing about, and quickly finds herself marked for sacrifice.
When Nan fails to return, her brother travels to the strange village that seems trapped in time.  It is dark, brooding and literally reeks atmosphere (as only good Black and White horror films can!).  Nan is not to be found and Mrs. Newlis claims Nan left after only a few days stay.  However, the woman who runs the bookstore believes something happened to Nan and helps him in trying to find out what.
A eerie Black and White film that is super for a late Saturday night horror fest!  The Quality of the transfer is super crisp!",1067904000,19,1835,4.544072948328267
1635196,5,B00005NKTH,"AKA ""Horror Hotel"" this is a good little shocker in b&w from England. VCI does it proud on DVD with nice extras like the interview with Venetia Stevenson (director Robert Stevenson's daughter). She plays Nan Barlow, a college student sent to an eerie fog shrouded village to do a paper on witchcraft and winds up being a human sacrifice instead. Her fiance' and a friend come looking for her and find things indeed off-kilter. The whole village is witch infested save for a blind priest and his niece. Christopher Lee is the sinister professor who sent Nan there in the first place. This is a low budget gem that runs at a brisk pace and keeps you glued to the screen.

1635197,4,B00005NKTH,"This review is of the VCI DVD - called CITY OF THE DEAD
also known as HORROR HOTEL.
COTD is a great creepy witch story with lots of atmosphere, a great New England setting and lots of fog.
The film starts with wonderful title sequence with faceless, hooded figures and medieval chanting. Then a recreation of a 1600s witch burning in Massachusetes. The exploration of witches in a fog drenched town.  Finaly great tension and action in a graveyard setting.
 If you like fun/scary, old style, black and white films that rely on atmosphere rather then special effects this is for you.
Almost on par with the original Dracula, the original Haunting, The Uninvited (Ray Miland), The Innocents (Deborah Kerr) and all the Val Lewton films.
 The VCI version has great extras and VCI acquired a beautiful wide-screen print of the film.  The VCI DVD is the best version yet. My only complaint is that the sound is a bit thin even for an older film but the original soundtrack for the most part excelent.",1008633600,3,994,4.662857142857143

1635212,5,B00005NKTH,"...or words to that effect. That's what I said when I saw this at my local movie theatre back in 1962 under its better known title of HORROR HOTEL. I have seen it many times since then, the last being this past Halloween. I was surprised to discover that I hadn't written a review for it so, here it is. This review refers to this VCI edition released under the original British title. As you can see there any number of versions of this title available but only the VCI release offers the best print and an uncensored one. This movie was made by a new company called Vulcan which quickly morphed into Amicus Productions who became a mainstay in 1960s and 70s horror through their anthology films such as DOCTOR TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS and TALES FROM THE CRYPT. It even has one of the icons of modern horror in Christopher Lee who was just setting out on his horror film career (he had done DRACULA in 1958).

The film opens with a prologue set in 1692. The witch Elizabeth Selwyn (Patricia Jessel in a masterful performance) is about to be burned at the stake. She places a curse on the town of Whitewood, Massachusetts. This original British version restores about 2 minutes of missing footage surrounding the curse. Cut to the present day (1960) where Christopher Lee is recalling the events to his college class on witchcraft. One student, Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson), is very interested and winds up going to Whitewood where she disappears. Her brother (Dennis Lotis) goes there looking for her, befriends a local girl (Betta St. John), and then he and she get swept up in the proceedings. This film is so well known that many people are familiar what happens next but for those who aren't, I won't spoil it. Just see it.

What makes CITY OF THE DEAD/HORROR HOTEL such a gem is the way that it is made. In addition to a captivating story, the movie features some of the most evocative black and white photography I've ever seen. For a good example of this check out the way the firelight dances around the room in the Raven's Inn sequences and how the fog swirls around the town graveyard. There are no shades of gray here. The performances by a cast of British actors with American accents is very believable and there's even a similarity to PSYCHO in one scene although this movie was shot first (but released later). The only drawback is that the then contemporary setting has dated quite a bit but not enough to really affect the film. With a running time of less than 80 minutes, COTD proves, in this case, that less is more and it's a movie that I return to again and again when I need a quality old school horror fix.",1383264000,4,2634,4.50836820083682

1635217,2,B00005NKTH,"...but it was released at about the same time.

""City of the Dead"" has long had a reputation as a much-better-than-average horror film. This reputation has been bolstered by the fact (???) that there's only one existing print. I saw it many years ago on TV, and it left a favorable impression.

My perception of what makes a film good or bad has matured. ""CD"" is worse than mediocre, and has little to recommend it -- unless you think billowing fog that obscures the sound stage sets is, per se, frightening. (Note also the careless production. A British telephone is used in a film set in the US.)

""CD"" has been compared with ""Psycho"" (see the Wikipedia article), and for good reason -- the similarities are so obvious you'd think it was rushed into production after the producers saw Hitchcock's film. The script is devoid of interesting characterizations or human interaction, and grinds through the plot so mechanically one might easily believe it was knocked out over a long weekend. It is a model of poor screenwriting, unusual even for cheap British films.

The Principal Blond is insufferably stupid. She reads about how victims are selected, and though all the signs -- lit up in figurative neon! -- point directly to her, she nevertheless opens the trap door and walks right into the arms of the witches. Her dispatch comes as a relief.

The best thing about this DVD -- which might very well justify its purchase -- is an extended interview with Christopher Lee. He's a riveting raconteur, and has interesting observations.",1341532800,,1535,4.821292775665399

1635220,5,B00005NKTH,"If you love old horror movies , and I mean pre midsixties when things really got going with more money and such. Then this one is for you, they have restored this movie and it looks pretty darn good for a regular dvd. Before they restored this is was a mess of lines and scratches now it looks sleek with a few specks now and then. They even put back two minutes of footage.  This is a spooky and creepy flick by even todays standards except there is not blood or actual showing of sacrifices in this one. It was after all 1960 and british cinema wasn't allowing to vivid violence yet. This was made by the brits that year; with the great Christopher Lee featured in it with his usual menace.  However what sets this apart here is that some of the actors are veterans of the stage and cinema. This is  s superior b movie in that regard. When you can get experienced people both in front and behind the camera then this is a huge step up compared to the usual first timer b movie type of affair. This is classy and although it's in black and white  it doesn't hurt this one at all. And if you didn't know this was shot in England you would have thought that this was a american movie! It's about a coven of satanic witches in  New England U.S.A. after all.  Certainly there have been real evil covens that are not wiccans throughout history. (Satanists) but few of them actually killed people , still the whole premise is scary here even without the supernatural aspect of this movie. The scene where a  young woman looks out of her window to see black hooded satanists chanting through the fog as they head for her doom is really chilling. A modern horror fan might not be as enthusiastic about these earlier movies because they are not as explicit but this one is classy and done by long time screen veterans. Therefore you don't  have clunky acting or dialog in this movie. Serious film critics would give this horror gem high marks for it's atmosphere and acting. There are two long interviews with several actors here as well.  Patricia Jessel is outstanding as the lead witch in this one. She had a real menace to her acting. She died at only age 47 sadly in 1966. Quite young even for those days.  This is a tight little movie that isn't campy and was played straight, horror fans back then must have been delighted with this movie. As it treated them with respect and fine acting. This was also known as ""Horror Hotel' but the original title suites it better.",1325894400,3,2466,4.3881578947368425
1635221,4,B00005NKTH,"THE CITY OF THE DEAD

This is a widely overlooked movie that combines great atmosphere with creepy demonic happenings to create a fantastic notion of horror.  It starts Christopher Lee who instantly makes anything sort of creepy, but it also has a great supporting cast that play their parts very well.  The movie is loaded with ancient lore, foggy sets, satanism, sacrifice, magic, and suspense to keep you interested, and indeed, there isn't one slow point to the movie.  It's just up front horror at its best.

The story involves a beautiful young girl who travels to the old town of Whitewood, Massachusetts to do some research on colonial witchcraft.  Whitewood as we find out with the films opening, was the scene of the execution of accused witch Elizabeth Selwyn by the townsfolk and its history is littered with demonic doings.  When Nan Barlow (the young girl) arrives, she finds the town everything she wanted--old, secluded, filled with those New England touches that tourists just go crazy for.  But there are ominous signs.  The church is fallen into disrepair.  The townsfolk seem to be nocturnal creatures who slink quietly from place to place.  The town pastor warns Nan that the Devil resides in Whitewood, and that she should leave immediately.

Naturally Nan stays, ignoring numerous warnings.  Witchcraft after all was nothing more than an incidence of hysteria, except in Whitewood, but Nan finds this out too late.  Eventually Nan's family becomes suspicious and begins to make inquires at Whitewood, finding that beneath the surface of this quaint town lies something much more sinister, and a people whose one purpose on earth is to please their dark lord.

The film does well in balancing a number of macabre elements to produce a chilling effect.  There is the strong backdrop of witchcraft, and the spooky inn keeper who looks exactly like the burnt witch Elizabeth Selwyn.  Lots of small things add to the mix, such as the mysterious hitchhiker who suddenly disappears in Nan's car, the bird she finds in her dresser with a pin stuck through it, the faint chanting that seems to emanate from below her room.

The satanic worshipers are pretty vile, too.  They are just what you want from such characters--mean looking, sardonic, merciless.  They are a frightening bunch and they mean business.  This is no troupe of affluent, urban dwelling devil worshipers who sit around a card table summoning demons for the fun of it.  These are hard core satanists whose transmitter to hell seems to be the real deal.  What makes them even scarier is their low profile.  They don't go around proclaiming who they are or making obvious examples of their powers.  Instead, it is hushed.  They sulk into the background and quietly wait for their next victims, much like some deadly spider.

All hell breaks loose at the end when too many of Nan's folk begin making inquiries into her disappearance.  The citizens of Whitewood assemble, as they have for the past 300 years to combat this outside intrusion.  The battle seems one sided as the citizens of Whitewood have Satan in their corner, and Nan's family, well, they don't have much.  Holy water isn't going to cut it here.

All said, this is a great movie.  It has some spectacular atmospherics and follows a solid horror theme of good vs evil.  It has a great soundtrack and lots of memorable scenes.  There are a few surprises, and while the ending isn't one of them, it is very cool and imaginative.",1318809600,3,3470,4.855195911413969

It's a superb example of what an innovative director can achieve within a small budget when s/he is armed with a first-class script and competent actors.

The story: A somewhat sinister college professor [Christopher Lee] captures the interest of an attractive female student in his lectures on black magic and witchcraft in early New England. In the face of outspoken protesting by her boyfriend, she ultimately decides upon a solo field trip to a small hamlet (which Lee specifically recommends) where a witch was once burned for practicing her black arts, said witch having cursed the town and all its inhabitants (for generations to come!) as she was devoured by the flames.

This film is incredibly atmospheric and psychologically creepy and, as one might suspect, Christopher Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy/dp/B00005NSXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy</a>) shines as he always has in such films. The movie is actually better in its black-and-white photography than it would have ever been in a color presentation, an aspect which makes this film stand out in the classic horror genre.

The movie also features actors Dennis Lotis, Betta St. John, Patricia Jessel, Valentine Dyall, Norman Macowan, Ann Beach, Tom Naylor, and Venetia Stephenson. George Baxt penned the screenplay (from an original story by Milton Subotsky) and John Moxey was the director. The compelling filmscore was composed and conducted by Douglas Gamley. This is a Vulcan Films production in cooperation with Britannia Films.

In addition to the film itself, the special features options include an available voice commentary audio track by Christopher Lee himself! An interview with director John Moxey is also quite interesting and informative.

Needless to say, she finds out too much.  I don't wish to elaborate on further plot details, suffice it to say that the scares are of the Val Lewton school of fright and are thus wonderful!  The performances are of top caliber, in particular Lee, Jessel, and Dyall in rather sensationalistic roles.

The setting and back drop of the film are classic for the 1960's and the black and white cineamtagory is very well done.  The actors, led by perennial horror actor Chirstoper Lee, do a great job in creating a sense of believers VS non belivers of witchcraft or science VS superstition.  There are the stereotypical moments in the film such as the black hooded servants of the devil marching towards the alter and the ending is pretty predicatable but climatic in a different avenue as to how to cast the evil out, which is much more associated with vampires.  This movie was done with good taste, as no nudity is shown, but the mystique is in no way lost as the diretor uses the dialouge and the actors strenghts to pull off a very entertaining movie.",1269734400,,998,4.653409090909091
1635226,5,B00005NKTH,"In this undermentioned British Horror film, a young college student, Nan, sets off to investigate the small New England village of Whitewood on her professor's lead with the hope of uncovering new information on witchcraft for her term paper. After her disappearance, her boyfriend and brother return to the town only to discover that she has been chosen to be sacrificed by the town's evil inhabitants! Director John Moxey creates all of the same stunning atmosphere found in Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY and the Hammer films through the dark Gothic settings and brilliant lighting effects. Whitewood is drowned in eternal darkness and a creeping fog that settles on the weathered streets, buildings, and central graveyard of the village, as figures creep in and out of view in the nightmarish town. Christopher Lee's manipulative grasp on the characters provides him with another sinister and imposing role as the film's heavy. CITY OF THE DEAD is one of the most beautifully shot, atmospheric, and eerie British Horror films outside of the Hammer series, making it a must-see Gothic Horror entry.

**It is important to note that the film is widely available in the public domain under its American release title HORROR HOTEL, however VCI's release of the film is the only fulled restored version in America, and has been completely remastered with brilliant picture and sound. This is the only way to view the film.

1635227,4,B00005NKTH,"""City of the Dead"" is also known as ""Horror Hotel"", a 1960 B&W feature that is actually quite noteworthy and deserves more recognition. Though this movie is sparse in terms of effects, it more than makes up for this lack by turning up the atmosphere - and the result is an authentic Gothic tale of witchcraft in New England. A young college student who is studying the occult, Nan Barlow (Venetia Stephenson), decides to exlore the small New England town of Whitewood, on the urging of her college professor, Alan Driscoll (Christopher Lee). She arrives in Whitewood, where she puts up (again at the behest of her professor), at the rather sinister Raven Inn, which is run by Mrs Newless (Patricia Jessel). The girl is rather naive and seems oblivious to the sinister undertones present in the inn and also in the village. Nan goes to the village bookstore on one of her excursions and meets Patricia Russell (Betta St John) who kindly lends her an old book on witchcraft. Patricia is also the granddaughter of the village Reverend, and when Nan goes missing, Patricia goes in search of Nan's family, to return a personal item that comes into her possession. She meets Nan's brother Richard (Denis Lotis) and Nan's boyfriend before returning to Whitewood just before the Witches' Sabbath, finding that her life may be in grave peril. The story moves on at a quick pace towards a climactic and quite unexpected ending.

This version is complete and uncut - containing 2 minutes of footage missing from the DVD titled ""Horror Hotel"". There is also an interview with Lee, Venetia Stevenson, and director John Moxey. Total running time is 78 mins. Aspect ratio is 1.66:1. This is a low-budget horror gem that definitely merits a watch and would enhance any classic horror fan's library.",1254700800,2,1782,4.842622950819672

1635229,5,B00005NKTH,"Horror Hotel [aka City of the Dead], 1960, is simply one of the finest horror films ever made. Kudos to director John Llewellyn Moxey and company. Though brief [only 78 minutes], filmed in black and white, coming hardly noticed out of England, with no major stars [Christopher Lee not yet a big shot] and released the same year as PSYCHO [bad luck] this is, nonetheless, a marvelously atmospheric and creepy flick. No blood-splatter experts needed here as this is just plain outstanding b&w moviemaking that unsettles with both sounds and silence, space and shadows, motion, countenances and lack of spontaneity. And that opening score---that chant---geez, turn the lights back on! A macabre, mesmerizing score. All about a college student who decides do her thesis on the topic of witchcraft. She decides to gather data by staying in a creepy little New England town [Whitewood] with a remote history of witchcraft and witch burnings. Small problem: they [the witches] are still hangin around and she happens to arrive just before the Witch's Sabbath [sort of their X-mas?]. On the Sabbath the broom-riders have to sacrifice a human ""at the hour of thirteen"" to perpetuate their living dead status and this poor kid seems to fit the bill. The student is targeted and killed. Her disapperance actuates brother and boyfriend to go out looking for her. British actress Patricia Jessel is a gas as the resurrected witch Elizabeth Selwyn---an impeccable performance. Lee, who plays the college professor who misguides his student to her doom,  has a subsidiary role in this one and is his usual wooden but sinister self. The scene where the naive student is walking through the barren streets of Whitewood at night and encounters elderly couples who pass her by, only to stop and stare back at her from a distance, is just plain eerie. Another nice scene is the sparse dance in the Hotel lobby where the wooden participants are into their thing, the dance gets faster---then everybody's gone. Indeed, Moxie's skilled acceleration, deceleration and abrupt stoppage of chants, music and motion provides a uniquely unsettling feeling throughout. Geez, how about the craggy old priest in his abandoned Church [the witches have taken over Whitewood] whose face sinks into the darkness of his spurned house of worship warning all to leave the condemned town. Overall, a simple storyline but masterfully crafted and, I believe, one of the all-time greats of the horror genre. You've gotta see this one after midnight, with the lights out and definitely under the covers. After watching this one you'll remember never to tell a stranger in your neck of the woods that you've not seen them about in your area before, lest he reply: ""... To have seen me is a special privilege...reserved for a chosen few "".",1246060800,3,2793,5.006451612903226
1635230,5,B00005NKTH,I have never watched to many british horror flicks but I have heard good things of this Christopher Lee movie.  The atmosphere is dark throughout the who movie which is nice for a black and white movie.  I find black and white movies sometimes lack the ability to bring dread to the viewer but being this is the first black and white movie I have seen with satanist and witch craft I was surprised.  Christopher Lee actually has less screen time then I expected but he pulls it off whenever he enters.  Seeing satanist burst into flames at the sight of a crucifix is kind of a b movie moment but still good. The ending was kind of weak and b/c of the ending in my mind the whole movie left me thinking it would of ended on a darker note instead of the way it did.  Christopher Lee is great and his voice always resonates in any movie he is in (I mean his actual voice by the way).  Special features include a interview with Christopher Lee which is a nice plus.  The one things this movie made me want was more darkness and more dread overall still a very good watch all the way through.,1230768000,,1087,4.222222222222222
1635231,4,B00005NKTH,"I had no expectations going into this, other than knowing that Christoper Lee was in it and I could watch Chrispher Lee read the phone book and enjoy it. So I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie genuinely creepy and unsettling. Lee is limited in his screen time but gives a dark and weighty performance. The subject matter is pretty grim and the production treats it with appropriate earnestness. The cinematography is great, with some wonderful use of dark, inky black shadows. Very nice sets and use of atmosphere, giving the film an almost suffocating, insular feel. And befitting the era, the performances and music are *big*, which will come across as corny and old-fashioned to some, but fun and just what the doctor ordered for people like me who appreciate ""big"". Some great music ""stingers"" too. The satanism and witchcraft practiced in the film are pretty heavyhanded, so its a real trip at the end to see witches and warlocks taken out by literal ""fire raining down from heaven"". An unexpected and wonderfully literal touch. I loved it.",1225238400,,1055,4.866666666666666

1635233,3,B00005NKTH,"I hadn't seen City of the Dead, aka Horror Hotel, since I was about 10 years old and it scared me then.  I wanted to see if it had the same effect on me now as an adult, which it doesn't, but that's not to say it's not a genuinely eerie movie at times, with some very effective moments of creepiness.  The cover art on the case might give the impression that this is a color, schlock-slasher, nudie-girl horror movie, which it's not.  It's an excellently photographed; glorious black-n-white, restrained (and better for that) exploration of devil worship and witchcraft.

The real treat of this DVD, though, is a lengthy 2001 interview with Christopher Lee which is a part of the special features.  Mr. Lee is SO funny, so charming, and has such intelligent things to say about his career; about actors today; the state of the British film industry and about the British media.  He is so personable it's like having him sit in your living room talking with you.  I laughed out loud several times at his comments, he is just fabulous!

1635235,4,B00005NKTH,"After suffering through bootleg copies of this film under the ""Horror Hotel"" title for years, this DVD was a welcome addition to my classic horror film libary.  Now that a nearly-flawless print of the film is available, I hope it will start to get the attention it deserves.

City of the Dead was made during the horror revival that began in 1957 with Hammer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-Frankenstein/dp/B00006G8JZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of Frankenstein</a>.  This was a time when the creaky old horror formulas of Universal (don't get me wrong, I love 'em) were giving way to more graphic scares, as audiences began to expect to SEE more than what their imaginations could provide.  Yet the film is something of an anomaly, in that it retains a gothic visual style without relying heavily on special effects.

Student Nan Barlow (then-newcomer Venetia Stevenson) is sent by her professor (Christopher Lee) to the New England town of Whitewood to research her paper on witchcraft.  Local legend tells of a witch who was burned there in 1692.  As Nan delves into the town's history, she encounters a host of diverse characters, many of whom seem to believe Whitewood is still under satanic influence.  I don't want to give away one of the major plot points for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say the story takes a shocking left turn about midway through the film.  Not everything is what it seems, and no one may be safe.

As for the disc itself, VCI is to be applauded for their efforts here.  The film looks terrific, and even though the sound is mono, it's clear and uniform throughout.  The interviews and commentary tracks are nice for fans of the film, but may come off a bit dry to casual viewers.  Venitia Stevenson, in a 2001 interview, seems just a tad embarassed and/or mystified by the film's popularity.  Lee, who pontficates at-length about his career, has the misfortune of being saddled with a rather irritating on-screen interviewer.  The only other real problem, a common one with VCI, is that the menu takes a little getting used to.

After languishing in b-movie hell for decades, I think it's time City of the Dead was elevated to ""classic"" status.  This fully-loaded--and attractively-priced--disc should go a long way towards that end.",1186790400,2,2335,5.102631578947369
1635236,5,B00005NKTH,"This film has a beginning very reminiscent of the opening sequence of Mario Bava's La Maschera del Demonio 1960. But since they were made at around the same time,it's probably just some weird unconscious global link between the two. The fascination for condemning witches and brutally putting them out of action by roasting them or by belting spikes into their faces, seemed to be emerging worldwide in filmmakers at this time. The film has a beautiful Lovecraftian atmosphere, although it has nothing to do with Lovecraft.
Patricia Jessel is absolutely great as the sinister witch who refuses to be put down and who vows to return to exact her revenge. Lee is very good with his New England accent and has a face that was born to play an evil warlock.

Trivia:
Just thinking about the weird 'NEAR-ANAGRAM' of Elizabeth SELWYN and Mrs NEWLESS. If you just exchange the single letter 'Y' in SELWYN for an 'E', you get the very close match: NEWLES.

Add on the extra 'S' for better pronunciation and it is simply transformed to : NEWLESS, or perhaps it was even spelt as Mrs NEWLYSS in the original script ?, this would make some sense as this spelling would still be pronounced as we hear it in the film (then the name SELWYN contained in that, would then be a more direct anagram). Just an idea.

But it's so close, it makes me think that perhaps this was the original script intention, but during the production perhaps this idea somehow got lost by the people who eventually did the spelling for the film's titles,and by the time they later realized, it was just too late/expensive to change them ?
Guess we'll never know, huh.
Meanwhile,....I have made my pact with thee O' Lucifer for all eternity ...",1176163200,,1705,4.657807308970099
1635237,5,B00005NKTH,"Another wonderful Christopher Lee horror film centered on witchery in New England.  Very atmospheric, with a neat chilling musical theme that adds to the suspense.  This film was made back in the early days of ""Hammer"" Studios when Mr. Lee was starting to appear in small budget horror from England.  The story was centered on this little town in New England which housed a coven of witches.  Back in the seventeen hundreds Elizabeth Selwin was burned at the stake, and she and her followers are re-incarnated into present day.  Elizabeth runs a hotel whose customers check in and never check out.

You won't be disappointed if you like a scare particularly on a rainy night.  It's filmed in Black and White which adds to the atmosphere.  I don't think the film would be as good if it was in color.

It sures beats some of the present day horror in theatres today. Good story and well directed.  You won't get bored with this one!

Be careful when it's the witching hour!

1635238,4,B00005NKTH,"Atmosphere, a decent story and capable acting elevate this horror film above its low budget constraints. Even though it was shot entirely in England, it takes place in the New England section of the US. It concerns a curse placed upon a town by a woman, who is burned at the stake for being a witch. In the present, college co-ed Nan Barlow is sent by her professor (Christopher Lee) to the village of Whitewood in order to research witchcraft for a term paper. Why Whitewood? You'll have a good time finding out. This is a very well made film that at times might remind you of ""Psycho"" or ambiguously of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. As Nan Barlow, Venetia Stephenson lends the perfect combination of competent acting, naivet and beauty (wow, what beauty). Christopher Lee turns in another dutifully sinister performance as the mysterious Professor Driscoll, and I was genuinely hard-pressed to find any weak aspects of this film. This is a very good, solid horror film that deserves to be seen. The VCI Video DVD is pretty decent, with cast and director interviews and Christopher Lee commentary.

1635239,4,B00005NKTH,"Down a long, deserted and all but forgotten backroad in rural Massachusetts stands the town of Whitewood. No longer appearing on any current maps, the only people who know of its existence are some of the older locals from neighboring towns who would stay away at all costs and of course the witches.

According to legend Whitewood was cursed by Elizabeth Selwyn (Patricia Jessel) and handed over to Lucifer as she burned at the stake in 1692 for practicing witchcraft and consorting with the Devil. Now some 250 plus years later the 'Raven's Inn' stands in the historic spot of the event.

Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson), a pretty college coed comes to Whitewood on the recommendation of her professor, Alan Driscoll (Christopher Lee) to do some primary research for her term paper on Witchcraft. She checks into the 'Raven's Inn' and is never heard from again. Her sudden and unexpected disappearance brings her brother and boyfriend to Whitewood to find her and instead discover a nest of witches in search of yet another sacrifice for Candlemass Eve.

One of the earliest and in my estimation one of the best British horror films ever. Released in the U.S.A. under the title, 'Horror Hotel', the American version is two minutes shorter than its British counterpart, 'City of the Dead.' The additional material is at the beginning of the movie during the burning at the cross sequence when the accused witch is calling upon Lucifer to curse Whitewood. It doesn't add much to the plot, but if you're a purist like I am it's nice to have the film intact in its original form.

This may have been produced on a small budget, but they made up for it with a great storyline, some ingenious atmospheric effects, an eerie soundtrack and an excellent cast. Besides those aready mentioned, also wonderful performances by: Betta St. John, Dennis Lotis and Valentine Dyall as Jethrow.",1129507200,35,1876,4.871473354231975
7947454,4,B00005NKTH,"RELEASED IN 1960 and directed by John Moxey, ""The City of the Dead"" (aka ""Horror Hotel"") takes place in Massachusetts when a curious college gal (Venetia Stevenson) vacations in the remote village of Whitewood to investigate its infamous roots in witchcraft/satanism. When she doesn't return her brother (Dennis Lotis) and her boyfriend (Tom Naylor) come to find out what happened. Christopher Lee plays her solemn professor while Patricia Jessel appears as the town's hotel proprietor. Betta St. John plays the the only normal person in the strange hamlet.

The movie was released in the UK at the same time as Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" I point this out because they share a plot similarity that was groundbreaking at the time (which I'm not going to give away). The film appears set bound, but it doesn't really matter since it was shot in B&W. Regardless, there's an effective spooky ambiance with fog galore. The intelligent and winsome Venetia Stevenson shines as the principal protagonist. WATCH OUT for her surprising ""Whoa, Mama!"" scene (surprising for 1959, when the film was concocted).

FYI: The film was not released in the USA until two years later (1962), albeit with the name ""Horror Hotel."" Important dialogue bits from the opening burning-at-the-stake sequence were censored from the American version, which was the version I viewed. Key scenes were used in the Iron Maiden video for their song ""Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter"" (1990).

THE MOVIE RUNS 78 minutes and was shot at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, England. WRITERS: George Baxt (screenplay) & Milton Subotsky (story).
