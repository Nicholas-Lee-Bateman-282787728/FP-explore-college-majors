5978596,5,B00FE5MX74,"I gave this season and all other seasons before it a 5star rating because this is hands down my favorite show. I love how they go into details with both main couples on the show, everyone's favorite couple is normally Booth and Bones but mine is Hodgins and Angela, they are so great together and they make you wish that you had that kind of marriage. I love how they insert Pelant in the show, he does a great drop all the way back to season 7 as the serial killer to catch. If they could pull out at least 2 more seasons out of their hats i would be incredibly happy. I love the forensics and even the drama the insert into the show. They have steered away from the reason in why they did this show, Kathy Reichs, but it has turned into quite an amazing show. I'm so glad that they finally get married, kind of sad for Hodgins and Angela as they lose all of their money to save a bunch of kids from being attacked by a drone. I love that i got to Ralph Waite before he passed away, he is so awesome as Booth's grandfather. I hope this show lasts for many more years to come. Great Job guys, you're an awesome cast.",1393027200,42,1116,4.077272727272727
5978597,5,B00FE5MX74,"This was one of the best Bones series ever.  The stories were compelling but the writers are starting to get tired and it shows.  The storylines in this season was filled with lots of science fiction and psychic crap which takes away from the fun hard science feel of the show.  The serial killer angle is well developed in this season but I won't go into detail here no spoilers.  I pre-ordered this Bones Ninth Season meaning I paid full price and I don't feel ill used at all.  The writers are running on vapors if their Ninth Season scripts are any indication but even on lifesupport Bones stands head and shoulders above most other police procedural shows.  Bones is still funny.  Bones still makes you care about all its characters not just Booth and Bones.  They really did a great job developing Dr. Sweets from an almost child like character to a man an evolution that is fun to watch.  I gave Bones a five star because; Bones still has the capacity to move me, to make he laugh, cry and feel strong emotions based on what it shares.  Bones presents philosophical and moral points of view that leave me thinking for days about the right or wrong of its message.  Bones makes me think what would I do in the face of some of the challenges characters face.  This ninth season gave me a moral what if it were me choice I will never forget.  Fiction squint Hodgins is a very rich man.  The serial killer gave this rich man a choice save your fortune being drained away electronically but to do so condemn an innocent group of middle eastern humans to death via an attack drone.  Seeing this choice forced upon one of the Bones characters made me wonder which would I pick were I in the same situation.  I like to consider myself a moral and good man but could I let my entire life's fortune and economic security \ relative comfort it generates drain away to save poor innocent people I do not even know.  That episode was so powerful that the choice it put before me is etched into my little gray cells.  My heart, mind and soul are still wrestling with the question posed by a single episode of Ninth Season Bones.  When a TV series can make me think and question myself on this deep level its worth its full price in my book.",1383955200,49,2233,4.37621359223301
5978598,5,B00FE5MX74,"""Bones"" returns for a welcome ninth season with its core cast, clever plots, and sense of humor intact. Forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and her crack team of specialists at the Jeffersonian Institute continue to work with their FBI liaison, Special Agent Seeley Booth, on new and challenging criminal cases. First, however, the team will have to resolve their long-running, lethal battle with cyber-genius serial killer Christopher Pelant, who has stayed one step ahead of them while inflicting pain on each member of the cast.

When we last saw the team, they had barely survived their most recent encounter with Pelant. In a final twist of spite, Pelant blackmailed Booth into withdrawing his marriage proposal to Bones, while forbidding him to reveal the reason why. Booth's promise puts a strain on his relationship with Bones. He will reach out to old Army buddies, including a CIA agent and a former priest turned bartender, for advice. Pelant has his own plan for separating Bones from Bones from Booth, permanently. The entire team will have to be on its mettle to head off Pelant's insidious plot.

The ninth season continues to feature crime of the week murders for Bones, Booth, and the Jeffersonian lab rats to solve. One episode will have Booth and Bones resurrecting their undercover ""Tony"" and ""Roxie"" identities for a hilarious marriage retreat in which they talk all too frankly about their relationship. Psychologist Dr. Sweets will take a leave of absence to work in an outreach center, only to find himself drawn back into a gut-wrenching case involving a gang feud. As in past seasons, other members of the team, including Lab boss Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Hodgins, Angela, and the interns will have their moments in the spotlight.

The producers of ""Bones"" have promised a wedding for Booth and Bones this season, which should be reason enough for longtime fans to tune in. And that doesn't do for fans, a scary-thrilling season finale should.  ""Bones: The Complete Ninth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1381449600,111,2051,5.059171597633136

There a suspect was convicted of 1st degree murder by the forensic evidence. I began watching CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and enjoyed the stories, but IMHO there really was no chemistry between the characters. Several years later my wife and I were looking for something new to watch and decided to check out one episode of Bones. We were hooked. We love the series, have purchased all 9 seasons and have watched every season at least twice, if not more. However, we stopped watching season 9 because the last season, season 10, has yet to be released. The banter between the cast is first rate. What they go through in various episodes is excellent, special effects is beautiful and the acting is super. I have recommended Bones to numerous friends and family and they agree great series. Can't wait for Season 10, maybe a full length movie and years down the road another season....maybe.",1443312000,,997,4.638418079096045

I find it provides a pleasant focus during my exercise - I limit myself to an episode every time I exercise. Though I am not into gruesome, their depiction of bodies etc. has major visual impact. Generally the dialog is very entertaining - not always believable, but it is entertainment.
The only episodes I am not a fan of for this or any other series are flash backs with the actors in prior time periods.
Bones and NCIS are my favorite recorded episodes.",1431734400,,554,4.55

5978958,1,B00FE5MX74,"Well, it's a shame Fox has decided to chase away Bones fans who demand the best in home video reproduction.  I stopped buying DVDs a number of years ago once I was hooked on High Definition video and lossless audio & I do not plan to downgrade back to DVD.  No Bones seasons on blu-ray means no more purchases of Bones seasons by me.",1420761600,3,333,4.1875
5978959,5,B00FE5MX74,"*I have often been asked why I love the show ""Bones"" so much and my only answer is ""if you saw it from the beginning like I have, you would love it too.  Not only that, it is one of those shows that rarely comes along where you are completely addicted and you cannot wait for the next episode to appear.  Being a huge fan of the ""X-Files"", this show reminded me of that.  Seeley Booth, tough, no-nonsense FBI agent who won't rest until he gets his man and world reknown forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperence ""Tempe"" Brennan who won't quit either until she gets the guilty......sound familiar?  A little like Mulder and Scully?  In season one (1) the producers of Fox studios weren't even sure ""Bones"" would take off but when they paired the tall, dark and handsome Seeley Booth (portrayed by David Boreanaz) with the beautiful, sexy, lady scientist, (portrayed by Emily Deschanel) it was an instant hit!  For starters in season one (1) the ""pilot"", you soon learn that Booth and Brennan share a past and Tempe doesn't want to work with handsome agent Booth.  Why?  The answer to that is in season five (5) but from the very first episode by them always bickering with each other,  underlies an emotional rollercoaster filled with electrical and chemistry undercurrents that cannot be denied with these two characters.  Never seeming to agree with each other, they realize they cannot work without the other either.  Sometimes the beautiful Dr. Brennan comes off with a cold facade and is also socially awkward but Booth sees all her good traits where no one else can and she tries to help him with the science and she is always watching his back no matter what.  So together as a team, they always catch their man.  As a devoted fan to the show along with thousands of other fans, I am patiently waiting until these two characters become a couple, after all, it is so evident.  When they finally did, I kept thinking, ""it's about time""!! I love the show and I have been watching it for ten years now and  I have never missed an episode and I believe I've seen each episode at least fifty times on TNT on weekday afternoons.  Incidentally, the show is the reason that drove me to read all the Kathy Reichs books which were excellent, by the way.  Although the books are so different from the show, I never refrain from watching it!..........signed a devoted fan!........thank you",1420761600,3,2379,4.639618138424821

5979072,4,B00FE5MX74,"I am quite fond of 'Bones', from its first season onward, and I have bought every season up to this season 9. In general, I found it relatively weak, compared the the first two seasons and the middle seasons 4 - 6. Ever since Booth and Brennan became involved and living together, especially after the tense cliff-hanger at the end of season seven, resolved in the first episode of season 8, involving serial killer Christopher Pelant. There is a fair amount of recycling ideas, such as the use of Booth and Brennan's undercover roles, Tony and Roxie, from season 2.

The episodes miss the tension between the two leads. Their having a child, and then getting married, transfers all that to marital squabbles, which are far less interesting than professional squabbles, which have far more interesting outcomes. I also miss Mr. Nigel-Murray (killed in an earlier season) and Colin Fisher (Joel David Moore).",1416182400,,907,4.928104575163399

5979098,4,B00FE5MX74,"Warning, this contains spoilers from the previous seasons and hints, but no major give aways from season 9.

Bones is a formulaic show for certain, but after a rough first couple seasons it found the formula that works, and the actors and characters that make it work.  If you have followed the show at all, and have liked it, then chances are you will like the 9th season.  It follows the story of the week format, but with story arcs tied in along the way.

The major arc of the past season plus, Pelant vs the team is brought to a conclusion this season.  The season begins with Booth sticking to having taken back his acceptance of Brennan's proposal because of Pelant's threat and the tension it is causing not only between the two of them, but the entire team.  Once that story line is resolved there is a major murder and corruption story line that keeps popping up throughout the season and winds up with the cliff hanger going into season 10.

We again see the rotating interns throughout the season, but with Clark being hired on at the Jeffersonian in the anthropology department ostensibly  as Brennan's equal, which makes room for a new intern along the the regular crop that we have seen the past 4 or 5 seasons.

As I said above chances are if you were a fan of past seasons (and not getting bored with the show) then this season will not disappoint you.  If you have never liked the show then this season is probably not going to do anything to get you to like it.  Certainly an argument can be made for it getting stale and using the same format over and over, but I do think the story arcs that are weaved into the mystery of the week format keeps the show interesting enough.

As for the DVDs go, the extras are in the form of commentary on select episodes, deleted scenes, portions of the comic-con panel and a gag reel.  My only gripe is that after having 5 seasons of blu ray releases the studio has gone to a DVD only release.  Hence my knocking it down a star.",1414800000,3,1984,4.355978260869565

It's smart, witty dialogue and the relationship between all the characters makes you laugh, cry and get angry right along with them.  Just when you think it can't get any better, they introduce a new serial killer that is more diabolical than the last.  The only negative comment I have is in regards to the DVD case.  Two of the last three seasons of Bones I have ordered from Amazon.com where broken when received.  Wish they were made of better, more durable plastic.",1414281600,,548,4.608247422680412

I would love to have this season, but watching the low definition DVD (480i) when I could watch the high definition Blu-ray (1080p) is like watching B&W instead of color.

Since all broadcast channels are required by the FCC to broadcast in HD, and most cable channels have followed suit, I have this season on TiVo HD. I just have to put up with the commercials. Since they already have this show in HD, I don't understand why the studio would cancel the Blu-ray.",1413936000,6,667,4.5041322314049586

Marriage killed the old Rhoda show deader than a doornail, and it's unclear whether Castle will survive the coupling of Becket and Castle.  So three cheers for Bones, Booth, the rest of the cast and the writers for season nine.  The third episode of Season 10 really sucked, though--hope it's just a rough patch (there was one equally bad way, way back, maybe season three, so one bad show every five or so years isn't exactly a bad batting average.",1413590400,2,684,4.590163934426229

5979267,1,B00FE5MX74,"Ok where is the Blu-Ray?  Answer: The marketing folks at Fox Home Video want to push streaming over packaged media, especially in the US.  It's also worth noting that Amazon offers HD streaming of Bones Season 9 as well.  The problem is the quality with streaming is mediocre at best and sucks at worst.  Every computer or Smart TV I've tried streaming HD  on tends to occasionally stutter or show horizontal picture tearing.  Most of the time the resolution is not full HD either, and then there is the audio.  To my ears, it's on par with analog FM broadcast quality, and the audio on Dolby Digital DVD's is not much better.  Blu-Rays by default use the best DTS encoding and even on a cheap audio system they clearly sound better.

Ok, I know there is a growing convenience market for streaming, but the idea it will displace more then a minority of the package media business is clearly wrong in my book.  Most people appreciate having the product in their hands as opposed to in ""a cloud"" somewhere.  With streaming, you are at the mercy of your ISP's bandwidth and the reliability of the cloud provider.  More then a few times during storms and other emergencies, I have hugely appreciated the ability to watch a full 1080p blu-ray movies without *any* external connection.

I have no problem with the choice to stream, until someone makes the decision *not* to offer the superior packaged media equivalent for marketing reasons.  Given how much orphan junk is currently released on Blu-Ray, there is no way a Bones Season 9 Blu-Ray release can't sell enough copies to pay it's way.

For me, I own a huge private media library of everything from Books and Laser Discs to Blu-Rays. To put Bones Season 9 in my collection, I have to choose between DVD, Streaming, or an actual higher quality 720p format (no tears or stutters) with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, representing the original HD broadcast quality.

For this I need to raise the age old argument between consumer's rights to product and the copyright holders right to restrain trade.  I think I will save this argument for another day, so I can put my bandwidth to better use :)",1412121600,17,2138,4.658666666666667

5979321,1,B00FE5MX74,"I loved Bones when it first came out because of the science.  The first couple of seasons were pretty good because Bones and Booth were just friends.  As the seasons have progressed, the show just keeps getting worse.  Frankly, I can't stand Bones or Booth.  Booth is constantly rude to the other characters on the show (especially Sweets, Zac, the squinterns and occasionally Hodgins).  The way he treats people is mean and yet it's okay because he's good looking.  The writers, the characters and evidently the viewers just overlook it or think it's funny.  Brennan is obnoxious because she 1.)  thinks she's superior to everyone else, 2.) is rude to people (like the little man or any Catholic) and 3.) she interrupts Booth while he's interrogating people.  Cops don't get in arguments while they're grilling someone. I also have a problem with suspension of disbelief.  When all the science is suppose to be spot on, I buy into it and then they do something really stupid and you're like, ""WTF?"".  Best example:  Pelant drains Hodgins bank account.  Like that could actually happen.  Maybe electronically but not realistically.  His corporation has thousands of employees no doubt.  Therefore there are thousands of witnesses that he got ripped off.  Of course the money would be restored.  It's just a number.  The bank has restored your money on occasion or refunded it.  What next, they're going to wake up and it was all a dream?  I watch the show for Hodgins and Angela and Cam primarily and this BS money thing was the last straw.  Season Nine was lamer than Season 8 which was lamer than Season 7 and so on.  And BTW, I've read Kathy Reich's books and in them Temperace is not some clueless dolt.  She's street savy and listens to Devo.",1409011200,11,1747,4.746666666666667
5979322,4,B00FE5MX74,"So, hey, where did the time go? I blinked, and Bones is heading into its tenth season. Season 9 was another eventful sauce, but that sauce is covering up some stale meat. The showrunner messed around and somehow ended up with 24 episodes. I can't gloss over that there's a discernable creak now in the Bones machine. It's long in the tooth, son. And yet enough bits of awesome went down that it's got me anticipating like mad this upcoming September.

The show's humble brag has always rested on this one thing: that the mystery of the week serves to accent what's going on in the characters' lives. The corpses are always introduced in gristly, grotesque fashion, and there's morbid fun in that, and I've always appreciated the dark comic undertones. But let's not front: we couldn't care less about the weekly parade of suspects or whodunit. We're drawn to how OUR characters react and interact with the murder case as a backdrop.

I'm fond of the super squints doing work at the Jeffersonian laboratory. I got mad love for the quirky squinterns - and it's sad what happens to one of them. But no one's fooling anyone - it's all about the world's most renowned, most literal forensic anthropologist and the FBI's coolest Special Agent this side of Fox Mulder. And it's all about that unbeatable chemistry between Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz. In Season 8's finale, on threat of reprisal, Booth caved to serial killer Christopher Pelant's (Andrew Leeds) demand that he renege on his proposal to Brennan. The Season 9 opener - ""The Secrets in the Proposal"" - deposits us months later to the harmful fallout, to the wedge driven between Booth and a very hurt Brennan. It's a well-crafted episode and while it doesn't give us any closure, by the end, it at least leaves the estranged couple in a place where they could start picking up the pieces. It's exciting times, too, in that we meet two people from Booth's much unexplored past: an old Army pal (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and a bartender who used to be a priest and to whom Booth goes as his confidante. I think my favorite scene in this episode is Tempe and this world-weary bartender, named Aldo (Mather Zickel), just talking at his bar.

Would that other episodes had been as fine and well-crafted as ""The Secrets in the Proposal."" Instead we get a batch of episodes that reeks of writers stretching and stretching. I didn't care much about the recurring story arcs about Cam's identity theft or her romance with Arastoo or Sweets' taking a sabbatical. They smack of filler.

Just as I was starting to wonder if Bones had gotten too stale, the show broadcasts its saving grace. The season finale - ""The Recluse in the Recliner"" or, as I like to call it, the ""Splash the Deutsch"" episode - is the great redeemer. It's one of the best, most badass episodes in the series, and it showcases Booth at his most badass. Okay, it's neat to see Seeley so content with his domestic situation, but I'm always jonesing for those moments when steely warrior Booth resurfaces. Boy, does he ever show up in the finale. And are you surprised that they left off with another cliffhanger? It's a devilish formula that works, son. Because I am hooked in for Season 10 just as I was going to shrug it off.

My favorite episodes from Season 9 (and possible Plot SPOILERS):

- 9-01 - ""The Secrets in the Proposal"" - kicks things off nicely

- 9-04 - ""The Sense in the Sacrifice"" - Are you sick and tired of Pelant? Well, watch this ep, son.

- 9-06 - ""The Woman in the White"" - Booth and Brennan tie the knot! Almost as cool, the squint interns are all called in by Cam to solve a case so that Brennan can just be all about her wedding day. It was such a blast seeing Edison, Wendell, Daisy, Colin, Arastoo, and Oliver in the same room. There may have been some bickering.

- 9-07 - ""The Nazi on the Honeymoon"" - Brennan and Booth honeymoon in Buenos Aires but end up assisting in a local murder investigation involving a Nazi war criminal and a laid-back cop who's a fan of Tempe's mystery novels.

- 9-08 - ""The Dude in the Dam"" - Would've been a blah episode except there's Brennan wrestling with social niceties as she's pulled into a feud with another author (Nora Dunn). And there's Hodgins sporting a disgusting boil on his neck that's actually a womb for a fly larva. Yuck.

- 9-09 - ""The Fury in the Jury"" - Brennan serves as a juror. 'Nuff said.

- 9-10 - ""The Mystery in the Meat"" - The Jeffersonian team probes the murder of a food scientist whose remains turn up in cans of stew that were served at a school cafeteria. But forget that, it's all about Angela, Cam, Caroline, and Daisy taking Tempe out for her post-wedding bachelorette party.

- 9-13 - ""Big in the Philippines"" - Grab a hankie; this is straight up one of the most emotional episodes of Season 9 as the team investigates the murder of a down-and-out country singer and a squintern faces an uncertain future.

- 9-23 - ""The Drama in the Queen"" - I liked this mostly because of the awesome new intern Jessica Warren (Laura Spencer).

- 9-24 - ""The Recluse in the Recliner"" - To repeat, a supremely badass episode.

5979323,4,B00FE5MX74,"This was a pretty good season, started darkly, and then ended darkly but some good stuff inbetween.  At last the Bonster and Booth
tied the knot though in a kind of odd wedding ceremony.  I loved the vows they exchanged with Booth recalling the fact that they were
getting married on the grounds where they first met.  I did not like the fact that the Church burned down and the creep Daisy blamed
Booth.  Why she continues to be on the show with Sweets I do not know; I don't like either of them, nor do I like the interns except
for Wendel and poor Zach who I wish they could bring back. This marriage was one of the highlights of this season, perhaps thee
highlight.  Going on 10 years and Emily and David still look very good, though there are some changes showing.  I fear that now that
they are together we may lose the funny little interplays or jabs that they used to throw at each other.  I also very uncomfortable with
the muslim on the show; especially since he is going with Cam who I really like.  I suspect this is another ""political correct"" move by
fox.  The whole Moslem world is a war with the west and I would rather not see this on the show unless or until Moslems try to act
civilized.  I believe we are in for some hard times.  Note that I live in NY and saw the towers fall.  The moslem is said to be a
refugee from Iran but he does not look Iranian; Iranians for the most part are Indo-Europeans and blood brothers with the Euros.
He looks more Arabic which is ok but he should be more honestly portrayed.
  Overall, BONES continues to be one of the more intelligent shows on TV; there are many ""cop & crime"" shows now, most of them stink, especially Riccoli & Isles and Cold Justice.  There are  good ones too, such as CASTLE & THE MENTALIST, both which I
love; again with similar premises to BONES: a little romance and crime fighting.  And I like the CSI shows too.  But BONES is the
pilot for me and it got me started on the other shows.  Now Bones will be back for season # 10 and I fear this may be the last one.
The producers promise the final episode of the last season will be a doosy.  It will be sad to say goodby, but who knows, I be
be premature.  We will just have to wait.  I did order season 9; I have all the episodes on my Video Library.  I am impatient to see
how the Booth, FBi situation is going to work out.  I gave season 8 only 3 stars if I remember right, but that was a big mistake: It
deserved at least 4 and maybe 5 for some really fine episodes (except where they let the mooch Sweets move in with them).
This one I gave 4 stars cause I did not like the last episode, though I do understand why they did that.  I do recommend this season to anyone who hasn't seen it; watch them nail Palant...Hooray!!  But Fox, please, exile Sweets & Daisy to Afganistan!!!
I will be waiting for season 9 DVD from Amazon with baiting breath!!  enjoy.  And Emily is still so beautfull!!!!!!!",1403827200,,2927,4.16934046345811

5979326,5,B00FE5MX74,"Brennan does need to be brought down a peg. I hate the way they have Cam taking that abuse from her and no storyline showing her putting Brennan in her place. Angela and the rest of the interns kissing her butt to stay employed when clearly Cam's the boss and can fire anyone of them even Brennan. Don't get me wrong I loves Bones and the 2 main character's hands down, but Brennan is getting to be a little much to take. If you are truly a Bones fan Some of you must agree a little.",1396656000,4,483,4.041666666666667
5979327,3,B00FE5MX74,"After having read all the current Kathy Reichs books, I can't see how anyone can put up with Temperance Brennan as currenrly portrayed. The Temperance in the books does not think she is the smartest thing to hit a lab or anywhere, for that matter. While the story lines may be good, Brennan's ego gets in the way. If she had even a hint of humility, the stories would be so much better. As it is, three stars are the most I can give it. Besides all the other questions I would put to Ms. Reichs as to why she allows her character to be like this, the biggest question I have is, 'What does Seely Booth see in her that he can overlook her uppity attitude. Brennan needs an attitude adjustment...and quick. It's just a surprise that those she works with put up with her. In the real world, someone would have pulled her aside by now and told her what's what. Too bad the writers don't write something like that in.",1395619200,8,912,4.277456647398844
