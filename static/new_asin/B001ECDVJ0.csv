8297694,3,B001ECDVJ0,"Got this for my granddaughter.  She watched it twice.  It is a little sad,  The horse Winky liked dies.  She never does get a horse but does get to ride one.  My granddaughter recognized the dissapointment Winky had...
Also had to explain cremation..the horse that dies is cremated. That was a little unusual for a kids movie.  This is not something I would jump to purchase for a 7 year old.",1391472000,,392,4.450704225352113
8297695,5,B001ECDVJ0,All my grandchildren enjoyed this movie. Iappreciated the way it spoke of the pony's death as natural and expected.no big hype. It will become an annual part of our celebration.,1388793600,,177,4.933333333333334
8297696,5,B001ECDVJ0,"Lovely movie for kids. The kind of film that's very hard to find in the United States: calm, interesting, with a great protagonist and a story that doesn't talk down to children.

One thing I find disconcerting and strange is that the girl on the front cover of the English version of this DVD is not Winky but her best friend. Did they think that putting a Chinese actor on the front would somehow sell less movies? Very odd that the main character, who is in almost every scene, is not the one on the cover.",1316995200,4,509,4.302083333333333

8297698,4,B001ECDVJ0,"Watched this movie yesterday with my 10 year old son and 7 year old daughter. They really enjoyed it. It takes place in the Netherlands at Christmas time, so one learns a lot about St. Nicholas (the Dutch version of Santa Claus).  It also shows how difficult it can be for a child to adapt from one culture to another (the title character, Winky, is a little girl who has recently moved from China to the Netherlands.) I would recommend the movie, although the dubbing of the English language is a bit awkward. Still a good film.",1259107200,6,529,4.453608247422681
