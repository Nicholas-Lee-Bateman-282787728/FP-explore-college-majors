8749214,4,B0014JGFFK,"From the theme song reminiscent of something from Top Gun,
to the few scenes where the studio poured more quality into the animation,
I find this show enjoyable.

For me personally, I'm just now catching up on this series
that I didn't get a chance to really watch as a kid.
I just remember the intro from back then.

Watching it now?
A lot of it is hokey.
I can't believe the big brother hasn't died yet from his shenanigans.
A lot of the attempts at humor fall rather flat.

Yet - The sense of adventure is there
and they manage to do it in the most non-violent manner I can think of,
which is a plus for me.

That and they have talking techno cars
that kind of transform.

You know what?
It sounds worse just reading this than it is to watch it.

It's fun - An acquired taste from the Saturday morning cartoons of the 80's.
Try it - You'll like it.  :-)

NOTE: While this particular copy -does- contain English audio,
it's actually shipped from the UK as a set of region 2 DVD's.
You'll need a DVD player that can handle that.
Either region 2 or a player that's unlocked for all regions.",1530748800,,1090,4.206730769230769
