Respect his playing and all that he has really contributed to drumming from being a rock n rolla. The video I wanted just because it was Carmine and I like all of his accomplishments. I think too when this video was first created it was in VHS format. it is older. In person Carmine showed me once how he knocks his sticks together. That lit me up.  He talked of stories regarding the times when he knew John Bonham touring with the Zepp when Carmine was with Vanela fudge. None of this is on this DVD of course but never the less, Carmine lays down a rock solid groove! I also really like his Vic Firth signature stick.  Can't go wrong here. Another classic to add to my collection.",1434153600,,773,4.216216216216216
