8297395,5,B001EAWMEM,"Jennifer Fox's Flying is quite an honest search into the hearts and minds of women around the world on the subject of love, men, and children.  It is fascinating to hear women's perspectives and to simultaneously see the unfolding of one woman's journey into learning about herself and what she thought was her idea of love at the same time.  Heartwarming and thoughtful, it is a candid and vulnerable auto-videography that stays with you long after you have viewed it.  It also encourages discussion afterwards.",1399852800,,512,5.0
8297396,1,B001EAWMEM,"I watched this purported documentary mainly because it was being shown on Natasha Del Toro's  America Reframed, a show which usually showcases worthwhile material.  What kept me watching after the first five minutes of this woman's unforgivable, self-pitying, navel gazing was the hope of seeing Natasha Del Toro prick and drain the boil of stupidity that was this film. This program consumed the longest year of my life.

Then I realized a few points that would have been glaring, flashing, red lights long before this piece of dead-air uselessness was ever compiled.

I realized that, if anyone had bothered to ask themselves the question ""Would I, given an opportunity to decide whether I might want this woman to be, or have been, my mother, have opted instead for being aborted?""  It's a germane question because, if you were genetically predisposed to be stable and sensible and perhaps even happy, this mother would screw you up before you had a chance to vocalize about it.  If, on the other hand, you were genetically predisposed to be unstable, lacking good sense and miserable, she might foster a serial killer of whiney women.

Jennifer Fox makes it amply clear that she thinks she's the center of the universe and that everyone else should think so too.  It's nice that, when no one else actually thinks that about her, she can simply concoct a never ending soap opera starring herself and hawk it to undiscerning PBS stations as a 'documentary' of her bourgeois woes, hangnails, and indecision.

The fact that Jennifer Fox is a perfectly humorless whiner may explain how it is that no man, or woman, can tolerate being around her long enough to give a rat's ass about her angst.  Can you imagine what torture it would be to be waiting on her table at lunch - or to find out you're sharing the cabin of an airliner with her?  Would you, absent a threat of great bodily harm, invite her to your house for dinner?  This woman is simply boring and boorish in the extreme and that's what she invariably brings to the party.  She's also the only person to whom this fact seems to be a mystery.

The saving grace in this vagina travelogue might be that the 'I'm a miserable person. Please take pity on me so I can film another relationship disaster with you having fallen sucker for my act' look seems to have been permanently frozen on Fox's face.  It just looks fake.

Then again, now that I think about it, this 'project' is most likely a scam, a fraud from beginning to end, a perfectly concocted ruse to see just how gullible the film industry and its patsies could be.  The obvious thing that screams fake is that no one could have these sorts of events occur without a carefully written sardonic plot.  So maybe it's worth watching for the humor.",1377388800,2,2760,4.655670103092784
8297397,4,B001EAWMEM,"i learned a lot about women's feelings from watching this documentary, and the women in my life liked it too but we all felt the main character has some serious problems to sort out in her life.",1366156800,,194,4.27027027027027
8297398,4,B001EAWMEM,"This is a very revealing travelogue-visual diary of the struggle between individuality as a woman and the exploration of emotional intimacy, where sex can be just a need to be fulfilled. Initially, there is an unclear definition of Jennifer's relationships with the men in her life: one, being involved with married man, who justifies his involvement with being unhappy in his marriage, the lover; and another man, also living half way around the world from New York, who is considered the boyfriend, but also a lover. Somehow, having the belief that one will get meaning and fulfillment in life through this process becomes almost an excuse, while ignoring the consequences. The pattern of Jennifer's relationships, as portrayed, significantly contrasts with established values and morals, a point she is confronted with by her friends and by women, and men, she interviews from other cultures.

It was clear that exploring the issues and sharing the experiences with others, particularly friends, made it possible to take different perspectives and integrate these experiences and concepts into the broader context. The friend's bluntness and honesty showcases the true nature of friendships -they can be a mirror of the most intimate aspects of ourselves, even when they are not obvious to us.

Across cultures there is the general experience that older generations are not able to understand the needs of younger generations, though they appeared very similar. Also, there is belief that men do not understand and feel threatened by woman's sexuality and intelligence. Two themes which are not explore with the depth they deserve.

There is an interesting dialogue about what is natural and unnatural, including marriage, homosexuality, or dealing with medical-ethical challenges, like saving a child from death with surgery something which is certainly ""unnatural"", while condemning other human behaviors which are genetically influenced, like homosexuality, and wondering what should be considered moral or amoral in these circumstances. These important themes are also not developed further.

Jennifer shares how her having been sexually abused by her track coach, when she was 13 years old, led her to not being able to love. She didn't want to become a victim and never shared this with anyone while growing up; she dealt with it by herself. She felt sex was the way to please and to get love; it took her many years to feel pleasure. Sex was mostly a way she could get physical affection.

A significant theme throughout the film is about woman's urge to have children and whether that should be done alone and without men for support. Women from various cultures discuss their raising children without men, and many times, being less burdened in a way by that choice. Struggles over custody and child support are featured through one of Jennifer's friends' experiences.

The paradox of being in between desiring to be a mother, and loving motherhood, and the enslavement which it represents, with the exclusion of any other talents and potentials, is marked sharply through the film. There is great joy as well as well as miserableness, together, concurrently.  Which time resolves, as exemplified by Jennifer's mother's own path of development.

It is interesting to see the differences and similarities in the social morays about sexuality across cultures and how there is significant contrast in the way sexuality is lived in the west -which is considered promiscuous in the eyes of other cultures- and how it is manifest in Asia and the Muslim world. In many cultures women are not even in touch with the capability to experience sexual pleasure; sex is performed more as a duty. In cultures where marriage is arranged, women are considered more as a possession and are frequently beaten up when not satisfying their husband's desires.

It was very amusing to see, in the film, how a group of women erupt in contagious laughter at the idea of pleasuring themselves, a concept they thought impossible until how to do it was explained to them by Jennifer. They didn't have the word masturbate in their language. Some people would say that these women's minds and souls may have been corrupted by such a conversation! The irony in the situation is that it was acknowledged that men masturbate in virtually every culture, but yet, women's masturbating is considered unnatural and even disgusting.

Paramita, a civil rights lawyer, is one of the mature, wisest and grounded interviewees in the film. For her, love is beyond attraction or the satisfaction of personal needs -it has the element of commitment. She, almost naively, questions how the world has come to this, where sexuality is so prominent and people engage in it, including masturbation, to the exception of other interests, and duties.

The movie presents the argument that love is the most important thing, but the preponderant premises have to do with self centered needs to be met without any corresponding commitment or responsibility. Some of the decisions people make in their lives, particularly as portrayed in the film, are motivated by the personal satisfaction and don't consider any degree of impact the choices and behaviors have on the children or others.

What Jennifer shares about her family, the parent's frequent fights, her  father's domination over her mother, her mother's difficulty dealing with her children once they were able to express their own opinion, and her grandmother's intrusiveness and overbearing supervision, begs the question of how much of her character and behavior is the result of these experiences.

Perhaps this an example of what happens when a person doesn't get what they need as a child to develop a coherent and stable sense of self, self-esteem, and identity, in a culture marked by the need for individuality and autonomy, and where social coherence and community has virtually disappeared, remaining only as an abstract value.

It is interesting to see how she tells her friends things she had not yet told herself. This resembles the actual process of psychotherapy where as patients we become aware of how we really feel and what motivations and decisions we have made, often unconsciously, when we communicate with therapists; it would awesome if we all had more friends who can listen, empathically and patiently, as we go over those issues we need to sort out, as Jennifer has.

The exploration of sexuality, of love, of relationships (friendships, conjugal, erotic), and about her identity as a woman, appears as a main quest, as the documentary unfolds, while her work in the production of other films is just a passing reference, as well as her work on a larger scale beyond herself. The way the film evolves, including the plight of women and the documentation of serious women's issues, appears as something almost accidental to Jennifer's life's quest.

Upon the serendipitous encounter with an African British girl she met in her flight back from Zurich the film shifts into higher gear. It was obvious that this young woman had been conned into coming to the US to become a victim of the sex trade, and if she and her friend hadn't met Jennifer their lives would have changed irreparably.

The film starts exploring the good girl-bad girl dichotomy across cultures in the world, the power of men over women, their desire to have what they want, including a virgin wife, their use of prostitutes (sex workers) to satisfy their needs and their refusal to please their wives sexually for fear they will be unfaithful when the husband is away from home. Sexuality appears to have always defined the roles of men and women.

Though Jennifer appears to take on the cause on behalf of the women, the question rises whether she is doing it primarily for them or for herself, as she is dealing with her loneliness (having broken up with her boyfriend, and her grief from having had a miscarriage). It is like she is taking on the crusade for women against the oppressing power of the males. A poignant question raised is -why would men want to have sex in this way, with a prostitute? A question which, unfortunately, is never answered; perhaps it is just rhetorical.

The Pakistani women were very aware of their feelings and their sexuality but preferred to maintain their virgin status rather than being disrespectful to their society, a manifestation of how certain cultures are less individualistic and self gratifying for the sake of the community, even if it increases their suffering. They shared how controlling the men were (husbands, brothers) to the point they could not go out of the house without explaining exactly what they were going to do. In one case, some parents killed their daughter when she got pregnant out of wedlock, it wasn't clear whether the sex had been consensual, but anyway, it wouldn't matter.

The anger that arises in women is usually repressed, but at times will manifest overtly, often becoming abusive towards the children or themselves. This dynamic was evident in Jennifer's life is echoed by other women in the film.

Being single, for Jennifer, became an act of rebellion to not be controlled by anyone. Through it all, it is apparent that she is living her single, independent life, with as much suffering as her mother and grandmother did in their unhappy traditional women's married life.  She preferred to run away from the suffering inflicted by her loved ones to a different suffering situation, but at least, it became her choice.

The most horrific example of control of women's sexuality is female circumcision, which happens particularly in Somalia, where the clitoris is ablated and the vagina sown shut, only to be opened on the wedding night, or later forcefully torn open by the husband's penis or fingers. These procedures are often done without any anesthesia; and the torture continues for several months, while the woman is healing and the man, regardless, wants to satisfy his pleasure.

A group of these Somali women, exiled in England, argue whether they would have circumcised their daughters if they were living in Somalia. Some said they definitely wouldn't; others opined that they couldn't know what they would do if they were in that environment, where the practice was expected; others said you could not afford to be ostracized by the group if you didn't comply, and the daughters would not become part of society.

The damage that inflicted by the abuse, and the abusive cultural practices, never goes away; something is lost in the process. You develop and you grow and move passed that, to new stages in life, but there is always that memory of the abuse.

A moment of irony is when Jennifer shares with her formerly married lover, that she had slept with one other man at a time when he had not been available for comfort; the man went ballistic and she has a sudden rush of a thought that she would have preferred to be hit by him than to lose him over that-the feeling of guilt and the desire to be punished. The fantasy of being physically abused seemed contradictory.

It appeared that this fantasy was the result of feeling guilty for the indiscretion rather than her having been the cause for this man's failed marriage and his sliding into alcohol abuse, something which appeared to happen after his marriage fell apart. It is true that this man decided to introduce Jennifer to his friends and children, and that obviously, his wife would probably find out about the affair sooner or later, but Jennifer did not express any shame, or guilt for having been participant in this illicit affair, which ends up badly, as they usually do.

This is followed by the journey through ""In Vitro Fertilization"" (IVF) to fulfill the desire to be a mother. Once Jennifer's relationship with her married lover ended she was ready to make a commitment with her boyfriend. Realizing that it is better to have one single person in relationship, rather than two and making things confusing, was revelatory for her. The movie portrays the sadness and disappointment of the procedure not holding, like it often happens to many women.

Her boyfriend, a very patient and tolerant man through all of Jennifer's inward and outward explorations, accepted things which most men would not tolerate, her independence, having a second lover, spending little time together, and not wanting to commit to him. He would have been just as happy living together, without children; he just loved her -unconditionally.

In general, women tend to feel more and men tend to think more, that is perhaps the reason why women tend to be better able to reflect on their emotions and behaviors more than men can. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule, but I wonder if a man would have been able to make a similar documentary.

Coming around full circle, to encounter mom, again, learning about her experiences early in life and hearing her mother accept that life was not all perfect, as it had been the previously engrained norm for, was refreshing, not just for Jennifer. It is an example of how people mature emotionally and able to reflect about their life as time goes by. And, finding out that in reality, she, the mother had worked hard to pass on the passion and desire for autonomous work to her daughter, and that after her children grew up, she channeled into her lobbying in Washington for a separate institute for hearing disabilities is certainly worthy of admiration. She had suffered from a hearing loss which she hid from her children so she wouldn't burden them with it.

The film gets closer to the end with the passing of Jennifer's grandmother while her two daughters' take care of her, singing to her and showing her love. All of her life, Jennifer had felt like an outsider to the close knit group of these three women, who had been so influential in her life; now, at this junction, she finally was part of them; something had changed, perhaps it was Jennifer. She realized, at the end, how privileged she was with her life, with her freedom, her sexuality, and being able to find out, experience and live, that there many different ways to be a woman, and she was no longer afraid of fully being one.

8297399,5,B001EAWMEM,"I'm puzzled by the first review here because I couldn't wait for the next ""episode"" of this film series when it played on PBS this year. Especially poignant for me was hearing the perspectives of women as diverse as Ethiopians subjected to genital mutilation, educated Indian women who had never heard of women masturbating, and Pakistani women not able to leave the house without a male escort. Still. Women need more films like this.",1257724800,3,435,4.891891891891892

8297401,3,B001EAWMEM,"This DVD set was a bit difficult to watch. It is not a soap opera as stated on the box . It is an agonizing introspective look of someone searching for love or the achievement of themselves as `a woman`, many times it seems she doesn't even love herself, she states in the introductions, she never wanted to be a girl - meaning she wanted the freedom her father had.
This would be a great series to watch for a course in women's studies, psychology or some related discussion group. It would generate some extremely interesting discussions, thoughts or papers.
As for the `pleasure ` of watching... it becomes mired in me, me, me. I just want to ask her where is the affection you should have for yourself and some empathy for others.  She regularly flies all over the world to many 3rd world nations but just seems to discover at the end... `hey I've been leading a pretty middle class existence'. I really feel sorry for someone who has traveled that much and does not realize what more the average American, yes even the average American woman has than the rest of the world.
There is so very much resentment over marriage and those that choose it and that life style over fulfillment in a career. There is so much anger over her parents marriage, her mother's choices, her grandmother's behavior, understanding might seem to come in the last episode, but the fear/anger of what other women have chosen is so overwhelming - that is until she decides she might want a baby and a committed relationship. With so much introspection it is very frustrating to watch such an intelligent woman obsess and not have compassion for women that have chosen the 'traditional' mom-homemaker route or come to some understanding concerning and investigating into ""Do they feel fulfilled"", it`s always the single or divorced ones that are doing the discussing, but then again everyone seems to have the opinion that there are no really happy marriages out there?. Also there is her acceptance of how her long distance married lover treats her, he says ""where are you"" and she is more than willing most of the time to come back - behavior that does make me doubt her logic as a free woman, she seems pretty bound to what his needs are.
But let me emphasize there is a lot of powerful discussion and thoughtful material in here - it's just not very entertaining - hopefully that wasn't its' purpose.",1227398400,7,2383,4.6469194312796205
