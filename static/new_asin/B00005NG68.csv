7947185,4,B00005NG68,"A must see for anyone who missed this in their childhood (or wanted to relive it to an extent).  May also be a must see for anyone enjoying ANIME in general or RoboTech in specific (per it's most recent incarnation) today.  A stepping stone between ""Speed Racer"" & where all that is today.",1235001600,,289,4.433962264150943
7947186,3,B00005NG68,"Well, there isn't much to say. This DVD, and the last of the episodes of Vol. 5 doesn't quite do it for me. It's the robotech 1 generation conclusion, so why is it so half hearted. Robotech is great, no doubt about that, but after the war, these last few episodes just conclude a soap opera that has been going back and forth all episodes. So it has really gotten old.
Robotech forever! But, there are better 80's anime's outhere, like Thundersub, Jace and the Wheel Warriors, Transformers, Saber Riders, Macron 1!..... Who don't these get propper DVD's?",1028937600,,554,4.663265306122449
7947187,5,B00005NG68,"Ever good series/movie needs a showdown, and the Robotech Macross Saga delivers bigtime. Khyron builds an army and prepares to launch an all-out attack against the SDF1 while Minmei feels sorry for herself practically throws herself at the already very confused Rick Hunter. If you liked Lisa Hayes in the slightest before, the last six episodes of this series will break your heart, sweep it up, and then miraculously put it back together. This series has what Star Wars lacks, (dare I say it) realism. In war there are no victories, only defeats, a lesson The Macross Saga teaches well.",1024531200,2,588,4.89
7947188,3,B00005NG68,"The sixth DVD volume of the Robotech series (the final DVD in the Rick Hunter Saga) contains six excellent episodes focusing on a romantic triangle, the new Human-Zentradi attempts at coexistence, and the final attempts at victory by Zentradi renegades - including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.
This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this DVD as a ""3"" for two reasons. First, concerning the DVD construction, the main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users. Secondly, and by far the most significant downfall, this DVD is NOT compatible with the PlayStation2, whereas the first DVD in the series worked flawlessly with the PS2.",1012780800,,1024,4.994152046783626
7947189,5,B00005NG68,"Robotech - The Macross Saga 6:  Final Conflict, contains episodes 31 through 36 of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s.
Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Set in the 21st century, Robotech's sweeping saga spanned three generations, weaving together three separate actual Japanese anime series.  The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed when a mysterious alien battleship crashed on earth.  The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone in the universe, end all wars and unite to understand and assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come.  As the story unfolds mankind would go on to become embattled in an intergalactic struggle, battling three separate alien races over the next 60 years.  The sweeping intergalactic saga itself though, merely becomes the backdrop of a deeper ""human"" saga.
This volume chronicles the dramatic conclusion of the first season - The Macross Saga.  In this volume we see the final resolution to the Zentraedi conflict and the love triangle between Rick, Lisa and Minmei, as well as foreshadowing of events to come.  Here are the episodes featured on this DVD:
Episode 31 - Khyron's Revenge:  Amidst an angry mob, the Protoculture Chambers are moved to New Detroit.  The origins of Robotechnology and the Zentraedi race are finally revealed.  Also, Khyron returns - with a vengeance!!!
Episode 32 - Broken Heart:  Rick is off to the rescue after Khyron kidnaps Minmei and Kyle.
Episode 33 - A Rainy Night:  Despondent over fears of losing Rick to Minmei, Lisa turns to Claudia who shares the woes over her initial courtship with the late Roy Fokker...
Episode 34 - Private Time:  DOH!!!  Rick stands up Lisa for a rendezvous with Minmei.  Plus, more Zentraedi rebellion.
Episode 35 - Season's Greetings:  Low on protoculture Khyron attacks on Christmas.  Also, lost and with nowhere to go, Minmei moves in with Rick.
Episode 36 - To The Stars:  The dramatic conclusion to the Macross Saga.  Khyron's final offensive, Lisa's new assignment and Rick's final decision:  Lisa or Minmei???  Plus, a sign of things to come.
Be aware that these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features (aside from trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV).  Not to fear though.  If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an ""Extra:  Elements of Robotechnology"" DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want on DVD:  interviews, trailers, commercial spots, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
Robotech is BY FAR one of THE BEST animation products EVER.  If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane.  Honestly, watching these episodes now I can honestly say that they are better than I remember.  You can't lose!!!

7947190,4,B00005NG68,"I love the Macross Saga, but I'm wondering if anyone is having the same problem I am having with this disc? When I get to the ""A Rainy Night"" episode, the color fades in and out. First, it will look good with its vibrant colors, then it will turn into a dull grayish tint. This happeneds throughout the rest of the episodes, as well. Aside, from this little color problem, The Macross Saga is great and just incomplete without the ending. I'm just wondering, if the quality of the disc is like this on all of them or not. Please, email me @ awk04@csufresno.edu, if you're having the same problems.",1001808000,,597,4.4363636363636365
