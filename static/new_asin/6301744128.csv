348721,5,6301744128,"I'm sure we can all agree that Sean Connery is one of the most respected actors of our time, but what in the world possessed him to do Zardoz?  Maybe it was to escape the image of ""Bondage,"" because this movie  was way out in left field from where he originally was.  Perhaps, this film  would not have been as great without him, but either way you look at it, it  will stay with you.  From the mystifying opening to the disturbing climax,  and all throughout the 1970ish special effects and camera tactics  showcasing Connery in his knee high orange boots and orange underwear,  there are different elements which can cause the brain to overload, but  that is if you're not careful.  Perhaps it is because of the mind altering  substance that I always seem to be on when I watch it, but this still  remains one of my personal favorites, because I cannot shake some of this  movie's images no matter what--and I love it!

I  was confused and enchanted by my first viewing of this film.  I went back  four or five times (hey, it cost only $2 then!) before its run ended. Every  time I saw it again, new layers of symbolism occurred to me.  (And, god,  didn't Sean Connery look great in a pigtail!)
I recently made my husband  watch the movie.  He didn't get it.  At all.  But then, he doesn't think  Dilbert is funny, either.

348873,5,6301744128,"As crackers, unattractive and semi-fathomable as 'Zardoz' is, you can't do anything else but award it five insane stars.

Any movie which begins with a tacked-on prologue in which a floating-head man, with felt-pen facial hair, insults the film's audience and smirkingly enquires: ""is God in showbusiness too..?"", is fine with me. - Especially when, moments later, we're faced(!) with another floating head, this time a granite Zeus, giving a satirical, quasi-political speech to cheering, treacherous, murderous warrior-types, before puking guns and ammunition into their craven grasps (It's so good to see that even in wild futuristic fantasy, modern suicidal political values are still being upheld).

Control is the key. An eternal, intellectual society, the Vortex, sectioned off behind a psychic force-field, rules absolutely the naive destructive forces that exist in the Outlands beyond it. - by means of stone-god Zeus and certifiable geneticist Arthur Frayn - old felt-pen face himself.
The Outlands consists of exterminators; a barbarous security firm without portfolio; and brutals; oppressed slaves exploited for manual work - when they're not being hunted down, shot and stabbed by the exterminators. This whole societal facade exists solely to provide food and minerals for the Vortex.
Into this Utopian but morally-ugly, faux-perfection swans vulpine police-man Sean Connery; resplendent in crimson nappy, pony-tail and thigh-high boots, who proceeds to merrily deconstruct the whole facade with harsh sexuality, cruel animosity, and even cruder violence. He says things like: ""Stay close to me; stay within my aura.."" and it reeks - but fits 'Zardoz' unstable allegorical cohesion like latex.
The internal Vortex is divided into various sub-cultures: The Apathetics and the Renegades being the principle two conceptualised in this story. The former, diseased by boredom into blank, impotent inanimates; and the latter, formerly scientists responsible for creating immortality (!), but are now sad lunatics, sporting bow-ties, tails and tiaras, forced to dwell behind plastic glass in disused funfairs. Both factions understandably yearn for death, but don't know how.. Enter Connery and co.

Seeing as it's director is John Boorman, watching 'Zardoz' veering uncontrollably from utter genius to mordant cringe-worthiness is entirely predictable. That it's sub-intellectual, violent, sexy, scary and ridiculously visual will also come as no surprise.
Boorman's is an erratic talent: Ken Russell was once accused of being 'obsessed by the image' (a strange criticism for a film director: it's like saying a writer is obsessed with words, or a composer with music..), and this epithet is even more applicable to Boorman.
He can/could be great: 'Excalibur', 'Prime Cut', 'Deliverance', etc..  but he's often dreadfully difficult. Often so hedonistic as to totally alienate an audience. As here.
His dvd commentary reveals his bemusement at the film's reception; he's  genuinely surprised that many found it confusing. His only concession is that, perhaps, the film is a bit ambitious for its budget.

Technically, 'Zardoz' is excellent: Beethoven's 7th is joyously apt; Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography - fog-filters, ghost-glass, et al - is splendid; the sets, ""the future is always in the present.."" are suitably jarring for such a yarn. And the effects...all done ""in the camera"" are top notch and distressful.

Supporting cast is very good. Charlotte Rampling is skinny (legacy courtesy of 'the Night Porter'), but still hotter than the hobs of hell. Her sensual, pornographically poetic sex-education lecture needs to be seen to be believed.
Sara Kestleman is another girl that looks like she doesn't eat, but again, oozes a wispy, hushed seductiveness.
John Alderton has that 'what the hell am I doing here?' look on his face throughout - the same look both viewers and critics had at the film's release - while delivering the film's MOST preposterous dialogue in dodgy peach shorts.

'Zardoz' foams with interesting ideas. Not all work, and perhaps there's one or two too many, but what does work is often exceptional. I've every sympathy for anyone who dislikes the film, but the 4o years that have elapsed since its release have tempered it's pretensions and attuned it's self-indulgence to acceptable levels.
It still requires effort and patience but it pays off -  And it does brag one of the best endings I've ever seen in a picture.

In other words 'Zardoz' isn't as intimidating as it once was, but viewers are still advised to approach with caution.",1507680000,,4579,5.427566807313643

348877,3,6301744128,"Zardoz is a psychological parable about the use of psychiatry to manipulate a juvenile delinquent who's in charge of a gang.

Only it's dressed up as this dystopian adventure dressed up with lots of psychedelic imagery.  Everything from the utopian society that manages to do everything in s ritualistic (and silly) way, to the dream-like quality of the story, as if you're experiencing reality through the lens of someone who is not only a delinquent or social malefactor but also has some kind of abnormal psychology coursing through his gray matter.

Solution; induce him into breaking the law, after which he'll be processed through the courts, and then hook him up with some hottie.  Only, in my not so humble opinion, the hottie female love/sex interest isn't so hot.  She's pretty plain, if not just down right unattractive.

It's a movie that could be mistaken as great art, but like the hijacked science fiction genre, is just a film written by a bunch of doctors and presented to society as ""great art"".  Well, great art is ain't, but it is an interesting watch.

The formula here is that you have a gang leader who is undomesticated, and is manipulated into something a bit more passive than marauding the commoners for sustenance.  After having gone through those motions he is then institutionalized, and then is challenged to break the psychological block, which leads to violence and then leads to him leading the life that society wants him to.  Again, it's dressed up with a lot of far-out imagery stemming from the period in which this film was made.

When I first saw it I was intrigued by the craziness of it all.  I figured it had to be metaphorical for some social malady, or just some artists commentary on society.

No.  None such is the case.  And, as a scifi fan who's had a gut load of abnormal psychology dressed up as science fiction for the sake of a bait and switch social message to the movie going public, I'm tempted to give this film ""the finger"".  However, it is interesting to see once.  And where I did buy the DVD when it first came out, I'm thinking I'll pass on the bluray.

An interesting watch.  It'll give you a window into the existential art scene as it existed in the early 70s.",1504310400,,2225,4.630102040816326

349004,5,6301744128,"This is a review of the Twilight Time Blu-ray; there are also some non-USA ones available at lower cost. The original Fox DVD release was pretty good, anamorphic with good sound (for the era). The Twilight release is, of course, superior, especially in medium and long shots where the higher definition really matters. There is no annoying time-bar when you freeze-frame (some Twilight discs have them and some don't). The extras are basically just two commentary tracks, one from John Boorman. Is it worth the additional (high) cost? I thought so, but I'm a big SF fan, and I liked the detail in the sumptuous interior middle shots. It certainly helps if you like the film, which, presenting philosophical ideas in this way, teeters on the edge of the ridiculous (or theatrical, in the pejorative sense).  But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up despite rather primitive SFX. The ideas, safe to say, are more interesting than the costume design.

Yup. This is THAT movie.

And it's exactly what you would expect from John Boorman in the seventies. He was, after all, the man who brought us ""The Exorcist II"" with its locusts and magical sci-fi tech, and almost gave us a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie involving kabuki dance and Frodo having sex with Galadriel. So ""Zardoz"" is what you would expect -- a seemingly gritty post-apocalyptic tale that turns into a strange, surreal social satire full of brain-melting nonsense. And yet, you just can't look away.

Zed (Connery) is an Exterminator for the floating stone god-head Zardoz, meaning that he spends all his time raping and murdering Brutals (ie your garden-variety savages) with the guns that are good. Somehow he ends up inside Zardoz's mouth (which is full of grain) and shoots a man he sees there. This causes the Zardoz head to crash in the Vortex. The Vortex is some kind of idyllic hippie community populated by psychic and immortal Eternals, led by Consuella (Charlotte Rampling) and May (Sara Kestelman).

In the Vortex, the Eternals have become overcome with ennui. They have no interest in sex, they all have psychic powers, and any Eternals who accidentally get themselves killed end up being reincarnated in plastic bags. Some of the Eternals are either aged artificially (as a form of punishment) or so apathetic that they won't even move if Zed tries to rape them.

Rather than immediately killing Zed, May decides to keep him around for awhile as a pack animal. Not kidding. With the assistance of Friend (John Alderton) -- and yes, that is his actual name -- Zed begins to figure out what has happened to the world, and what he truly is. Furthermore, he reveals what he has learned about Zardoz, the book that cued him into Zardoz's true nature (and no, you won't guess what it is) and what the future of the human race will be.

John Boorman took all the drugs. ALL the drugs. There were no drugs left when he was done, because there is no other possible explanation for a movie so mesmerizingly nonsensical, so beautifully incomprehensible, so hypnotically insane. In a sense, it is the PERFECT bad movie because it is so incredibly earnest in its nonsensical silliness -- it not only believes in its silly story, but it believes that this is a GREAT story with deep messages.

Specifically, Boorman is attempting to address serious issues of feminism, religion, genetic engineering, technology and... stuff. Which is to say that he brings the topics up in a vague way but rarely explores any of them in a semi-logical way -- it is experimental in style, but has kind of a crusty, misogynistic way of seeing the world. No amount of hippie blankets or crystal rings can hide the unpleasant overtones of ""Zardoz,"" such as the idea that a world of gender equality would emasculate men and only a hairy rapist barbarian could fix things.

Or as another example, the entire story can be seen as a class struggle -- the Eternals are effectively nobility some centuries into the future, looking down on the savage, filthy ""commonfolk"" Brutals even as they leech resources from them. How does this play out? Well, the Eternals want the Brutals to kill them and destroy their civilization. Logical, right?

In the meantime, Boorman stupefies the audience with lots of gauzy lighting and odd special effects. Expect crystal rings, magical computers, psychic powers (shown by finger wiggling and headaches) and halls of mirrors. There are some clever twists, such as the symbolism of the book that Zed found and could somehow read despite a total lack of education -- namely, ""The Wizard of Oz."" At least, until you realize that that means that Sean Connery... is playing Dorothy. Which means that the other major characters are the Wizard, Dorothy's companions, and... nobody is the Wicked Witch.

Speaking of Sean Connery, he gives about the best performance that he possibly can, considering he never looks entirely sure what is going on. However, there's something unnerving about the fact that he's our main character. Zed is an unapologetic murderer who openly tries to rape women, then gets mad when they don't struggle... but we're supposed to like him and root for him.

Apparently his genetic superiority is supposed to automatically equal a sympathetic character. Or his manliness. Or both. Yes, we're apparently supposed to be dazzled by how manly and awesome he is, since he is the only one in the Vortex who can get an erection (I wish I were kidding). And of course, his sexual awesomeness is able to even break down Consuela's hatred of him, turning the Evil Penis-Hating Feminist into his panting fangirl.

If you can stumble past the penis-hating stone head and Sean Connery in an orange diaper, ""Zardoz"" might end up being an entertaining film -- if nothing else, its beautiful insanity is worth watching for the offensive silliness that ensues.",1425168000,6,5116,4.8342857142857145

Connery is a warrior who's purpose in life is to kill people because they procreate too much. He is commanded to do this by a floating rock head, Zardoz. One day he jumps into the head and floats away to a new land, where he meets people who are young, intellectual, and immortal. Their immortality makes some of them jaded and bored. Some people choose to become almost zombies. But no one in the region can die, for some reason. Eventually Connery discovers ancient scientist had developed an immortality machine, then destroyed mankind's memory of the machine in order to make it impossible to give up immortality. But Connery overcomes that, and then it gets really crazy.

The setup wasn't all that crazy to me. Not all that different from Logan's Run. But really went off the rails in the second hour. The third act just goes crazy and the ending is blah. I kinda like some of it, even enjoyed the 70s style.

The rest of this review is just questions:

Wait, how did he lose his sight? And how/when did he get it back? Did I miss something?

What's with this aura that he suddenly has which repels certain people? And then he has the power to actually kill people?

Is the theme that there is a distant future in which Man co-opts the powers of God (like immortality), but is intellectually incapable of handling the responsibility and reality of it, so they must breed a new evolution of man (Zed) that is capable of handling the power (choosing who dies)?",1424822400,4,1735,4.544871794871795

ZARDOZ: The year is 2293. A giant, scowling stone head floats over a ravaged landscape. It spews guns and a philosophy of death to its faithful followers, the Exterminators of Zardoz, who genuflect in obeisance. One among them, however, sneaks inside the head and hides. When it lands, Zed (Connery) finds himself in an idyllic community full of magical hi-techno place for a Webley-wielding barbarian. Hes captured, disarmed and held for study by the eternally youthful, immortal inhabitants of this Vortexthe decadent Eternals, who live in Eden-like luxury, cloistered away from Brutals like Zed.

While the placid population of this utopian commune debates the meaning of the monster in their midst, Zed keeps his eyes open and his mouth shut. He soon discovers that there is trouble in paradise: dissent and dissatisfaction, deadly boredom and virtually terminal apathy. The mysterious Tabernacle which connects and protects them all also imprisons them all. Can the genetically bred Zed fulfill his destiny as an Agent of Evolution and destroy the evolutionary dead end that is The Vortex? And if he succeeds in destroying Eternity...what then?

Discussion: What *has* Arthur been doing out there all these years? one immortal wonders idly. Arthur Frayn, in charge of the post-apocalyptic Outlands, has patiently spent generations secretly breeding the perfect killing machine, is what: genetically engineering a brilliant Brutal who is smart enough, strong enough, and viciously bitter enough to kill the deathlessness that holds the Eternals in evolutionary and emotional bondage.

Immortality, it seems, has backfired on these improved humans. Sleep is obsolete and sex is history; they have become eternal children, sexless and androgynous; antecedents of the Eloi, just as the Brutals could easily be the missing link between Man and Morlockand both types are well along Wells Time Machine trajectory. Worse, even with unlimited time, the Eternals apes brains still cant answer the timeless Big Questions. Their mandatory immortality has turned the Vortex into, not a dystopia, but an anti-utopia, where ennui is their worst enemy and many among them crave the gift of sweet release from their incarcerated incarnation.

Give Boorman credit for creating a unique, well thought-out utopia, complete with its own culture and problems. Its a difficult film; to appreciate its satirical philosophy requires a reversal of our most primal and most deeply-held beliefs, that Life is sacred and survival is the first imperative. But if you can suspend your disbelief and accept the premise of the problem, the whole idea of Utopia becomes questionable and turned topsy-turvy.

Philosophical themes are scarce in cinematic sci-fi, but Zardoz flaunts them in abundance, and with tongue-in-cheek twists. The hero, Zed, is Death incarnate; his mission, to kill God. Heavy, heady stuff: high camp at its loftiest. Its Freudian science fiction, where eternal children rebel against their cosmic parents, attempting to kill the ultimate Father figure of the Tabernacle and sleep the sleep of oblivion in the womb of Mother Earthwho has been so subdued that the only expression left for Her is violent Evolution: the Death and Rebirth of an entire society, an entire species. Its Jungian science fiction, where any trait pushed far enough becomes its own opposite. Its Nietzschean science fiction, in which humans dare to seek God (and to look behind the masks of God) in order to destroy It and end Its oppression and enslavement. Its mythological science fiction, full of dialog and imagery as psychologically primal, archetypal and raw as Beowulf, Camelot or Ulysses. Its science fiction as religious metaphor: a story of revenge against a gods betrayaland of a nature gods revenge against the hubris of Humankind for creating the offense against nature that is The Vortex.

Zardoz is also a visually brilliant film, full of hallucinatory and hallucinogenic imagery, which peaks in the mind-bending touch-teaching sequence, a multi-media swirl of compressed art and information. And its an aural experience as well, quoting Nietzsche and T.S. Eliot in the dialog, and using both the mournful and somber Second Movement of Beethovens Seventh Symphony (in a haunting vocal performance) and its bright, ecstatic Third Movement in appropriate portions.

As if all this wasn't enough, Zardoz is also a deeply facetious film; a silly satire bursting with mock portentousness (All that I was is gone, Connery mumbles through a porridge-thick burr), parodied pretentiousness (In hunting you, I have become you), pithy dialog (It was all a joke!) and the damnedest cleverest title of any movie ever made. The secret behind the mock-god Zardoz is simultaneously obvious, unguessably brilliant and enormously amusinglyproof that self-proclaimed charlatan Arthur Frayn really is a wizard of gods. Even though he, like all the rest of them (and all of us!) was bred and led by the Evolutionary Imperative (in a cynical sense, humans might very well be merely genes way of manufacturing more genes) he can still claim authorship of this shaggy god story.",1423267200,2,5392,5.261627906976744

349916,1,6301744128,"As usual, most reviews of this film seem to be by admirers.  If you are an admirer of the film please, just skip my review!  If you haven't seen it, perhaps this will help you decide whether or not to watch.

Director Boorman reportedly had ""carte blanche"" to do this film his way within the budget, after his success with ""Deliverance"".  He took that carte blanche and created one of those truly awful movies that become cult classics--I guess because some people find really bad movies amusing, and others are fascinated by the quirky movies with Big Ideas, no matter how bad their execution.

Do not watch this film because you like Sean Connery and he has the lead role--unless you want to see how astonishingly poorly he can act without good direction, or maybe because he didn't really care, or perhaps this was a particularly messy time of life for him.  In any case, Sean Connery running around in red diapers and randomly firing a pistol throughout much of the film is not a pretty sight--and when he opens his mouth to utter the script, you realize it's now a double assault on your senses.

Briefly sketched, it's a vision of a possible future (from 1974) in which live a small group of people protected by a force field (the Vortex) and a super-computer, the Tabernacle.  The people inside are immortal through the advanced science of the Tabernacle, but confined forever inside the Vortex with nothing much to do, some lapse into semi-catatonia, some become alienated and rebellious and are allowed to age but not to die, and the rest end up in sort of the worst imaginable attempt at democratic communal living.  Outside the Vortex, what remains of humanity (at least in England where this story is set) consists of ""Brutals"", who either raise crops to deliver to the immortals, or run around killing everyone with weapons provided by Zardoz, a giant flying head [yes, really!] looking like a very primitive clay Godhead...the idea seeming to be, to keep the population manageable.

Sean Connery, one of the Brutals, ends up inside the Vortex, where people divide into two factions: those who want to kill him as he poses a threat to their peaceful ennui, and those who want him to destroy the Vortex, bring back death, and (if they are women, to bring back sex, too).  Sadly there are no good nude scenes, as a couple of the actresses were quite attractive, and that's the one thing that might have provided some genuine passion in this film.

I have to admit the opening scene in which Arthur, the immortal who came up with the flying-head-god delivers a short monologue directly into camera, was somewhat intriguing and raised my hope that this might really be an interesting film.  Terrible acting, a generally bad script, inadequate directing and uninspired cinematography soon combined to dash the hopes which the initial scene stirred.  This film is like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" meets ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and is destroyed by the latter.  For me, it belongs somewhere in the worst 100 films I've ever watched.  However, if you're a fan of campy sci-fi, you too can become a devoted follower of clay-head-god Zardoz!",1418860800,5,3141,4.767527675276753

In this post apocalyptic setting, we are led to believe that the film will develop into a Mad Max life struggle for life through sheer brute force, and yet it is not. The film has a deep message about the dual nature of Man, about the role and misguidance of religion and the effect of desensitizing our primal instincts for the sheer sake of reason and knowledge. The Yin and Yang of human identity is explored, at times ruled by animalistic urges, at other, by cold and detached calculated self serving reason for the sake of ""science"".

  I've read Boorman had a near unlimited budget, and many reviewers have commented positively on the production design, but I can't see it on the screen. Most of the outdoor scenes were simply shot on a village farm, and the interiors tend to just be rooms from country houses dressed up with bead curtains and dangling bits of fabric. Where the production didn't scrimp was on the acting talent, which is uniformly fantastic. Perhaps this left little remaining to shell out on sets... or perhaps they had plenty of money and Boorman intended his film to look like a '70s era episode of Doctor Who or The Tomorrow People. Who knows?
  What's fun about Zardoz is you never know what will happen next. The film often isn't sure what story it's trying to tell (rip-off of H.G. Wells' The Time Machine? raunchy, futuristic garden party? Peckinpah-esque sci-fi gun porn? brains and technology being overthrown by brute force and erections?), and the characters change motivations and alliances with elan. To give one example, Sean Connery's Zed begins the film as a diapered caveman, then becomes a diapered noble savage, then becomes a diapered enemy of the state, then becomes a diapered revolutionary hero, then becomes a diapered chosen one/savior figure-- with little in the script to justify the progression, and all the while his I.Q. seems to increase by about 80 points an hour. In one scene, Zed may be whipped by some characters and protected by others, then in another, the latter group does the whipping and the former the protecting; The one woman who hates Zed for the whole film abruptly falls in listless love with him for the final act... It's a hoot!

The great thing about Zardoz is that the production values are actually pretty top notch, and the effects hold up even today.  Resembling something close to Planet of the Apes but with a religious (cult) type twist, Zardoz follows Sean Connery in his underwear as he wakes up to discover a world ruled by immortals who pry and prod at Zed (Connery) for the secrets he holds.

350317,4,6301744128,"Zardoz is another extremely odd 1970's sci-fi film (think Quintet). Two societies, one intellectual (the Eternals) and the other physical (the Brutals) live side by side but never meet. Sean Connery is a Brutal out to shake things up. I like almost everything about the movie except the wardrobe and costumes. I just cannot relate to people wearing flimsy, brightly colored clothing. However, the characters, themes explored (nihilism) and overall story is very interesting. Sean Connery stars as Z who is a militia man charged with controlling the population in the Outlands where he lives. There is a secluded society full of humans with advanced powers that Z discovers. This is well worth watching if you consider it to be a period piece of 1970's UK. It has all the trippy elements of that time period including a memorable, overpowering score. You aren't likely to see anything quite like it again. If you know the work of director John Boorman (Excalibur, Exorcist II) then you know what to expect in terms of fantasy and dialogue-driven storytelling. It's not Excalibur but it has a heavy dose of fantasy that asks the viewer to take seriously. Zardoz is a film you may not understand on your first viewing but many additional details can be gathered on repeat viewings. You can't take it seriously in some ways yet it does have layers of complexity and philosophical thought contained within. I loved the part about Z learning how to read, learning about the past and how it changes him. Also, Friend tells him, ""We explored the stars on our spaceships looking for answers around the universe."" Z asks, ""What did you find?"" Friend replies, ""Another dead end.""

350421,4,6301744128,"Boorman's film, ""Zardoz"", has been panned to the point that it is now nearly impossible to locate, so it will probably soon become nearly unknown. OK, it takes itself too seriously, is poorly edited, and overstates a number of themes, such as the obvious nihilism of physical immortality (""Give me death!"" cries one of the characters), the detachment of a sufficiently-advanced human race that has forgotten what it means to be human in the first place, and that millenially-old theme, the desperate need for humans to kill the old gods--the mythical being(s) they have allowed to control them. Magritte's surrealist painting of the stone head floating in air itself receives a new interpretation, as does the Beethoven 9th's second movement. If you don't get the opening statement by the fellow who plays ""the man behind the stone stone head""--read ""the man behind the curtain"", from The Wizard of Oz, you simply won't get what Boorman was trying to do here. The film screams out to us, the humans of a still-violent future society, ""Look at the man behind that curtain!"" I liked the film because, as heavy-handed as it is, it reminds me to destroy my own false gods if I would discover the true source of my authenticity as a human being. As a retelling of The Wizard of Oz, it's too intellectually lazy to pan Zardoz. I think I understand the young Sean Connery's participation in this production.

350573,4,6301744128,"Maybe this is the movie that explains why I have always found Sean Connery so very sexy. In this movie, he's basically the only sexy male. Very possibly the only fertile male in the story.

The year is 2293. Zardoz is a giant stone head that is a god to the Brutals -- the people who are not the Eternals who cannot die. The Brutals can, and they can also breed, but Zardoz provides weapons to the Brutals whom he has chosen as terminators, raised specifically to kill. He also accepts the offering of the grain which the Brutals have raised.

But Zed (Sean Connery) is different. He's learned to read, and he's wandered through a library, and learned a great many things the other Brutals don't know. So one day he hides inside the grain shipment that is shoveled into Zardoz's mouth, and thus takes a ride inside the stone head to a very, very different place. This is Vortex Four, where colonies of Eternals live. There are the attractive ones that have no sex. There are the Apathetics (catatonic) who don't move, don't blink, and if you raise their arms, they will slowly sink like through clay. The punishment for non-conformity among the Eternals is aging. But they don't die. They can't die. So there is a colony of Renegades who are all old, but cannot die.

It's the future gone terribly wrong, and only Zed can save the Eternals from the hell they have created for themselves. So he does. Not everything will be clear about how he does, or what is going on, but if you're like me, you'll chalk the weirdest parts up to some sort of acid trip, and just follow it to the extent possible. And remember, I've seen it twice before. I can only vaguely imagine what it would be for someone seeing it for the first time.

If you're a science fiction fan, if you are able to watch a movie and just go with what happens without it all flowing in tidy story format, or if you're willing to watch it several times to get all the strangest elements, I think you will come to understand why this movie has become a cult classic.

It's about where a population that just keeps on growing will eventually find itself. Most of all it claims you cannot stop life. That life will prevail and overcome it's enemies no matter!

350575,5,6301744128,"I was but a strapping lad of 18, in my first year at an engineering school, when I first saw Zardoz. My classmates were unanimously scornful - ""What the hell is this?""  they asked. But I was fascinated - an early sign that my days in the sciences were numbered - with small numbers at that. But 35 years later, the film still beguiles me -- more for its wacky charm and for its effort to send a Message.

Zardoz is about a tripartite system of humans in 2293 - in other words, wicked far into the future. At the top of the heap is an ever-youthful race of Eternals, who live in agrarian bliss inside protected bubbles called the Vortex. They live the trippy 1970s dream of agrarian hippies - gathering wheat and  baking bread - wearing skimpy tops and meditating. At the bottom of the social pile is a dirty, heaving mass of Brutals, eking out a living in burnt-out cities. Life not being miserable enough, they are beset by gun-wielding, horse-riding Enforcers, who shoot them down at every opportunity. Both Brutals and Enforcers worship Zardoz, an enormous flying stone head, who demands sacrifices of grain, and bestows guns and ammo to the Enforcers. When Zed, an Enforcer (played by a bare-chested, pigtailed Sean Connery) stows aboard Zardoz along with a load of grain, he comes into contact with the Eternals. They consider him a beast, but are fascinated by his existence as well as his virility - an aspect of humanity they have deemed expendable.

Up to this point, Zardoz seems like a silly film about an effeminate race trying to get back its mojo. But there's a lot more going on than meets the eye. Zed's existence spawns an existential crisis in the Eternals, who are starting to question the value and validity of their system. Is Zed really a subhuman slave? Or does his existence suggest superiority? Is the Vortex a safe haven or a boring and inescapable trap? The Eternals are anxious to keep such thoughts at bay, and isolate those who disagree. These renegades are sentenced to age, and to dodder on blissfully on the margins of their world.

The first half of Zardoz was well-paced and a helluva lot of fun. Connery was aptly laconic as terrific as the cold-hearted, hot-blooded Zed, playing him with often hilarious reserve. Consuella (Charlotte Rampling), the female leader and enemy of Zed, was all icy rage and purpose. Quite a horsewoman too! The idea of a flying ""god head"" was inventive, funny and awesome. The questions at the heart of the film were intriguing. But new ideas and themes and images kept piling up, with no end (and no easy resolution) in sight. Characters who spent the whole movie as enemies suddenly (in the span of a single sentence) became allies and lovers. Forces that were all-powerful succumbed after the lightest of probings. The effects were primitive (really - how many mirrored halls can one movie show?),  and the skimpy wardrobe hilarious (the film has more boobs than a National Geographic special. But the acting was unironic, the script great. plot twists brilliant and the ending perfect.

All this indeed make Zardoz a messy failure, as my classmates believed, but a noble and even daring one.  Zardoz found a boldly imagistic way to explore the value of mortality and to question whether the wealthy and connected can establish societies that benefit hem to the detriment and exclusion of others. Zardoz touches on politics, death, religion and freedom. Not bad for a silly sci-fi flick.",1318896000,3,3455,4.765886287625418

How would I go about describing this movie to someone who hasn't seen it before...it's 106 minutes of pretentious twaddle masquerading as something more intellectual.

Especially when it intones ""the gun is good"" and coughs up a ton of weapons and ammo.  But what passes for futuristic is oddly old fashioned: hippies in a commune zapping people with their minds when they aren't baking bread.  They also like to punish people by aging them.  They sport dinging-pinging rings that chatter incessantly while the plodding plot drudges so slow I kept losing sight of the ""message"" this film purported to espouse: ""conformity is bad.""  Or.  ""Agree with them or die.""  Either prospect was unappealing and didn't require 106 minutes to tell.  As for the title and its impact on the sheltered mind of Zed (Sean Connery), one can only suppose he was easily shocked because I don't recall The Wizard of Oz giving me such a bombastic reaction.

Zog is something of a noble savage, played by Sean Connery, who stows away upon the floating head in order to discover the secrets of the immortals.

Watching this through for the first time, I had a hard time deciding whether it was a brilliant failure, or a hilarious farce.  It's wildly ambitious, but I had a hard time taking it seriously.  Sean Connery in his red loin cloth; the telepathic immortals who seemed like incredibly rich, young, and beautiful hippies, but who slowly succumb to the disease of boredom; a serious lecture on the mysteries of the erection.  Somehow, Charlotte Rampling managed to be convincing as the immortal true believer; her performance was entirely credible even in this strange and unwieldy world.

""Zardoz"" represents the science fiction film zenith, in an era where thoughtful films like ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""2001"" got the green light from studios, after decades of bug-eyed monster fare geared toward children.
  If you are a fan of clasic written word speculative fiction by the likes of Issac Asimov or Authur Clarke, you are gonna love this film. Set in a future world with cruel class divisions, it tackles all the big questions-- from the morality involved in using religion to manipulate the masses, to whether immortality might not be all it's cracked up to be.
  The whole production is highly imaginative and unique, with wonderfully lurid and spectacular in-camera special effects created by cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth (2001, Superman I).

There are hints of clockwork orange - Logans Run- planet of the apes- scattered throughout Zardoz- Connery comes across as cerebral and desperate- Rampling and the supporting cast also do fine jobs with the sometimes over the top nonsensical dialogue! But this is part of the films charm- they just don't make these weird trippy films anymore and for the cheap price this is a must own dvd- very rewatchable. For a low budget film the results are great and i cant recommend a better film to watch on a snowy winter night.

350648,5,6301744128,"There are lots of reasons to love--or hate--Zardoz, depending on your tastes. Technically, its a weak screenplay, a meandering plot that goes round in circles and seems to make little sense, too much T&A (and beefcake) to qualify it as much more than a glorified peepshow, yet not enough sex to be actually erotic. In that way, the movie is immensely frustrating--I either want there to be less sex or a whole lot more.

If you're a straight guy tuning in for either the sci-fi aspects or the boobshow, you might get a little tired of seeing Sean's half naked body, clad for the entire movie in something resembling a giant orange diaper. Girls and gays however, may really learn to love that diaper, along with the novelty of seeing  ""James Bond"" in a semi-raunchfest.

I imagine that, in its time, it must have been considered very dirty and radical. By today's standards, of course, it would just barely earn its ""R"" rating, despite the aforementioned bare breasted ladies and sexual situations. And for those considering buying it to see Mr Connery in the altogether, there are no butt shots to be found--despite poster art to the contrary depicting him on a massage type table with his posterior exposed. Alas, despite the brevity of costume and abundance of sexual scenarios, the sex in ""Zardoz"" is mostly implied, not shown.

As with ""Barbarella"", ""Zardoz"" is elevated, if not outright saved, by the presence of its star. Just as Fonda lent ""Barbarella"" a dignity it didn't quite deserve (by giving ridiculous dialog her all, and playing what was essentially a cartoon character with a commitment that actually gave it pathos and intelligence), Connery is so obviously overqualified for this job that one wonders exactly why he's even IN this movie to start with,. This, of course, lends""Zardoz"" its camp incongruousnes which is essential to any cult classic.

Without Connery in fact, this would be--in spite of its sporadically imaginative sci-fi imagery, a largely forgettable film. His presence secures its cult status and renders it a guilty pleasure for the ages. It's actually easy to rewatch--owing mostly to the trippy imagery.

Some may say that this is one of the worst movies ever made, possibly The worst movie.  I had to have it for just that reason. One of the main characters has a painted on mustache and beard and wears what look like boxer shorts on his head.
I believe a big part of Zardoz's 1 million dollar budget was spent on drugs and alcohol.  I read ""when Sean Connery in a wedding dress is not the silliest thing in the movie"", well...  I sat through this whole movie just to see if I could.  Somewhat of a challenge.  The story is poor, the acting is awful, everything is bad.  There's a floating head the spits out guns and bullets, preaching that the male organ is a bad thing.  There are questions, along with slide shows, with people trying to figure out how erections work. You just have to see it to believe it.  That's why I recommend Zardoz with all my heart.

  The story is set in a post-apocolyptic world where humanity has been genetically and spatially separated into two castes--the savage Brutals and the telepathic Eternals, somewhat reminiscent of Wells's Morlocks and Eloi.  Zardoz is the story of a Brutal, Zed, played by Sean Connery, who becomes a ""guest"" of the Eternals.  The story is rather complex and would probably require several viewings to understand fully, but I myself had difficulty finishing it once.  The movie is limited by its special effects.

  Moreover, I found Zardoz somewhat derivative of Kubric's Clockwork Orange, which had debuted only two years prior.  In both movies, a violent, bestial subject is studied and forced to watch images in a dystopian future setting.  Both movies feature a Beethoven symphony in their scores!

Or at least they wish they were.  Thay can age, when punished, but they cannot die by their own hand.  Oh, each commits multiple suicides but always are reborn asexually.  There is no passion, no accomplishment, only existance.
Zed arrives and the society is quickly torn apart as they must face their own fears, desires, and an all consuming wish to die.  Is he their savior, and in what form?
This is another visually stunning John Boorman film (Emerald Forest) which moves briskly while presenting some pretty heady material.  Not your typical Sci Fi epic and is not for everyone.

Zed is the brave warrior chosen by an enigmatic God whom the human race obeys without reserves, giving him all its harvests and receiving weapons for its unconditional loyalty.

When he realizes the origin of the name a smart device (that I won't reveal you because it's part of the puzzle) he travels into the stone head (or should I say Stone- Henge? ) to discover an isolated oasis - far from the madding world - where the instructed people lives into a big burble of peaceful comfort but also an unbearable existential boring ( the renegades a sort of human people condemned to live forever  and the indifferent ones ).

Once he comes he is imprisoned and analyzed until the same entrails of that race will make all their best in order to destroy that state of eternal bliss.

OK, seriously though, this is a heavy-handed and over-acted attempt at cerebral science fiction that pontificates on subjects like religion, inequality, and human nature.

Sean Connery is Zed, an exterminator charged by Zardoz (a faux-god residing in a giant, floating, gun-vomiting head) to eliminate the savage ""brutals"" in this nightmarish future world. The movie is steeped in pretentiousness from the annoying floating head introductory narration to the incredibly stilted dialogue, of which follow several random examples: ""I am innocent of psychic violence!"", ""No! I will not go to the second level!"", ""Shall I seek vortex consent?"", ""We will touch-teach you and you will give us your seed."", and of course, ""The gun shoots death and beautifies the earth...Zardoz has spoken!"" The entire movie prattles along like that, and contains other unintentionally comic elements such as Zed being frightened by a Jack-in-the-Box (really), Zed discovering an inter-vortex exchange holograph (don't ask), Zed getting the stuffing beat out of him by a bunch of demented geezers at the senility home, Zed teaching the ""eternal"" women how to kiss, thereby reintroducing desire and emotion to the world, and of course, Zed battling refracted light in the funhouse challenge inside a giant computer-crystal (again, don't ask).

I am not totally down on the film, I just think it fails as serious science fiction, and becomes a parody of the genre, despite Boorman's commentary track extolling its virtues. The special effects are very basic: the floating head is, for instance, simply suspended from a crane, while in one key scene Zed obtains a secret power enabling him to make the film run backwards.

The film is enjoyable as a camp classic, but is lacking as a serious movie (it was also a commercial flop), despite pretensions to be enlightening. Especially onerous is the predictable ending which is even more lamely executed than expected. The film was made in Ireland (Boorman's home) and as such does have some lovely landscape and scenery to recommend it; further the cinematography is generally quite good. The film is let down by trying to do too many things at once, and consequently doing none of them well. The pacing is frequently plodding, the acting is middling at best, the costumes are more hilarious than anything in recent memory (again, Connery's costume is justification enough to buy the movie), the morality of the film is preachy and heavy-handed, while the script is way over the top and utterly laughable. The most pretentious scene in the film (and one of the most pretentious I have ever seen) is the discovery of the true identity of Zardoz by Zed when he is learning to read. (Hint: I don't think that Frank Baum would be especially pleased.)

I recommend the film to science fiction completists and fans of camp everywhere: you will seldom if ever find a better example of unintentional humor in a desolate future world than in Zardoz.",1230422400,2,3183,5.080305927342256

350759,4,6301744128,"Considering a title like ""Zardoz"" and a cover featuring Sean Connery in what looks like a red diaper, this movie has a lot more seriousness and quality going for it. It is 70s science fiction: glitzy, ridiculous special effects providing a medium for real social commentary. The thing is, though, Boorman plays up the surreal and Carnivalesque in this movie, resulting in something closer to a fever dream than escapist fantasy. Re-introducing the social commentary results in a movie that is compelling and maddening all at once.

If a viewer gets past the opening and the following introduction of Zardoz the giant gun-giving clay head without thinking that something is amiss, they probably aren't actually taking the movie seriously enough on its own terms, and from there it's pretty easy to get lost. What we have here is an abject reversal of the Adam and Eve/Fall from Eden story. A futuristic society that has achieved immortality through the Tree of Knowledge, and thus created their own god, now obsesses over reclaiming death before apathy or senility overtakes their entire culture. Thus they set Zardoz the false god into the barbarian lands to both control the population and genetically direct the birth of a Savior or Son to come and reteach them the means to eventual death. This One is Zed, played by Sean Connery. It's also a commentary on classism. There's some aspects of male sex wish fulfillment. And old people running around in Halloween costumes while aristocrats destroy works of art.

Personally, I found it more overwhelming than campy, which is not exactly the way many people approach this movie. I do agree that in many ways it's very silly, but some of those arguments -- poor acting, dry delivery, random shoutouts of philosophy -- could easily be attributed to The Matrix if you think about it. Remember that this is the director that made Deliverance and Point Blank. These movies are genre thrillers with a special and idiosyncratic form of anxiety setting them over the edge from simple entertainment.

350808,5,6301744128,"The premise behind this film is brilliant. It cleverly weds two disparate and apparently unrelated segments of 1960's-70's culture in an endlessly fascinating and endlessly provocative way: the hippie/new age counterculture & the world of new technologies. In the cultural moment when this film was made, these two segments of society were at odds. Most countercultural movements were anti-technology and prescribed a return to nature while the new technologies presented the possibility of an escape from nature into a wholly man-made, genetically engineered, and virtually governed, reality. In our own postmodern moment, this battle between nature and tecnology seems to have been won by technology, but the resurgent green movement gives this film renewed relevance.

Granted, this film has some serious problems. In some ways the film appears to be a kind of reactionary backlash against the women's movement. It doesn't take a mastermind to see that John Boorman, the films writer & director, is arguing against what he perceives to be the feminizing trends in western civilization. And that the problem with the ""utopia"" presented in the film is that it is run by women and feminized men. Wow!!! Talk about a hairy-knuckled script, but thats why this ride is so bloody fun. However problematic politically, this resurgent primitivism is one of this films lasting appeals.

Boorman's cure for this ailing utopia's ills: The woman-hitting Sean Connery, of course. Once he comes to town (vortex) to knock some sense into all of these feminine & feminized utopian subjects all will be returned to bloody, very bloody, male-dominated normalcy.

Did Norman Mailer write this script?

The political wrong-headedness is just one of this films many allures.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The story:

Sometime in the past (judging from the outfits, probably sometime in 1969) some ""great"" (or ""mad"") scientists set out to create the perfect society. Lucky for the scientists, the world was falling apart just as they finished their ambitious biosphere and so humanity, or at least a select portion of it, was easily seduced into climbing aboard. The older scientists promise the youth culture eternal youth (and what could be more perfect than that for a narcissistic blonde neo-crypto fascist collective?). Once they enter the biosphere called the vortex, however, there are rules, serious new age rules, and so the vortex is really not so much a utopia after all, but a freaking cult! And members have to abide by the cult's strict no individual consciousness rule or they are penalized with aging ( any assertion of individual thought or feeling is seen as an act of rebellion against the new order and the penalty is, well, getting older ). The youth cult's titular leader is an impish Magritte-loving magician named, appropriately, after a children's fantasy book. But the real leader is the super-computer Tabernacle that preserves the past, but only as dead knowledge with no relevance for the new order of new beings, and whose real function is to regulate the new age present. Oh yes, and Tabernacle, somehow, communicates telepathically with cult members via crystals (evey cult member wears a crystal ring). Another bit of genius!!

The leader Zardoz really has no powers per se, like most cult leaders he simply knows how to manipulate minds. He is basically the Dale Carnegie or Jim Jones or David Karesh of this utopia.

But, as always, there is trouble in paradise. Both from rebellious elements within and without this new age compound.

For in the outlands surrounding the hermetically sealed vortex, barbarian tribes, leftovers from the old world, still roam in masculine splendor, raping and pillaging all the peace-loving mortals. And all is sanctioned by Zardoz (to the barabrians Zardoz is a big stone godhead that hovers over them--but, of course, Zardoz is really just a fancy rock ship piloted by the impish magician), who the barabarians in their masculine egotism perceive as a God that loves them and cares for their souls. What they failt to see is that all that Zardoz really wants is an all-out genocide. Zardoz wants all trace of the barabrians to be erased, only then will Zardoz's takeover of reality be complete.

The surprise: Sean Connery as Zed is not only a masculine thunderbolt with a gun, he's a reader.  And once he figures out that Zardoz is just a trickster like David Blaine or Criss Angel or political figure of your choice and not a real god, he's determined to penetrate the secret lair of the faux god and unmask the hoax once and for all. Ok, he wants that and he wants to invade the oppressive exploitative vortex and kill everyone inside (all except, of course, the beautiful Charlotte Rampling with whom he wants to start a new race of his own --a righteous race of good old barbaric beings that will turn humanity back to its old recognizably natural, mortal self and horizons once again). And he succeeds brilliantly!

As awesome as that plot is, the plot is not really the thing; its the ride that counts, and as cinematic amusement park rides go, this one is full of new age hilarity and more camp than you can shake a crystal at.

Connery looking like someone's scary new age dad, or a Burning Man refugee, is unbeatable!

But, honestly, the film keeps you thinking the whole time, and the visuals, riotous & campy as they are, are strangely stimulating & irresistable.

Zed (Connery) is one of the exterminators, killing Brutals under orders from a renegade Eternal. This renegade gives the first hint that the Eternals have a problem: there is dissent, an all-but-capital crime. There is also ennui, with no hope of ending their endless lives for release. Then Zed enters the Vortex ...

The scantily clad twenty-somethings of the Vortex remind me of the self-concious physical freedom of the post-hippie 1970s. They also remind me that a slim bust is a lovely one, something easy to forget in our era of implants. The youth culture of the Eternals, like that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logan-s-Run/dp/B00004VVNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logan's Run</a>&nbsp;from about the same time, also celebrates the era before the boomers found themselves graying. And, by the standards of today's special effects, 1970s opticals and mirrored walls look more campy than special.

Then there's Connery himself. In the 1960s, he defined the dashing, adventurous role of James Bond. At the end of the 1980s, he would mature into a senior statesman of cinema. Think of Zardoz's unfortunate time as Connery's mid-life crisis. Why he agreed to run around in that red panty, I'll never know.

But, if you take it as an artifact of its era, it can still reward the viewer. Maybe we can't suspend disbelief the way it original audiences could, but maybe we can see it differently than they ever could, as a future that only the 1970s could have predicted.

I wouldn't call it a thinking man's movie, but it is full of metaphor, irony and interesting observations on the human condition. Ladies and gentlemen: you have been warned.

Zardoz has set in a post apocalyptic setting, but doesn't really get into that scavenger roaming the earth theme like Road Warrior or Waterworld. Instead you have one ""primitive"" surrounded by the evolved ""eternals"". In other words Mad Max type PA fans should look elsewhere. No spectacular special effects. Actually there are hardly any special effects at all. The futuristic sets aren't anything to write home about, though the on location landscape is pretty enough. Like I said... this isn't your average sci-fi.

What Zardoz really puts on the table is content more of the mind-bending nature. The movie is about manipulation on several levels as well as the consequences of a conditioned society and how it reacts to change. There isn't a lot of action, and the action you get isn't enough to satisfy any adrenaline junkies out there. The events unfold more like a ballet, using symbolism as much as conventional actions.

Bottom line this is a very different kind of Sci Fi. For those of you who like exploring new ideas then this movie is for you. I know this is probably the most vague review I have done, but I just can't describe what I got from the movie. It took me a while to figure out how to rate it. All in all I enjoyed watching Zardoz.

350883,3,6301744128,"In about three hundred years, after some catastrophe has virtually wiped out our civilization, two branches of humanity remain to sparsely populate a now pristine Earth.  The ""Brutals"" are uncivilized apes - ruled by an army of gun-toting, loincloth-wearing ""Exterminators"" who kill with little compunction.  The Brutals are themselves on a divine mission, ordained by the great god Zardoz to cleanse the world ""of the plague of men"".  Taking the form of a huge, flying stone head, Zardoz lands amid gangs of Brutals, preaching genocide and spitting huge piles of guns and ammo at his gleeful followers.  ""Go forth, and kill"", spake Zardoz, even as his gun-firing followers fill his head with crops harvested by Brutal slaves.  Zed (Connery), one of the Brutals, stows away as the stone head floats away, thinking it will bring him to the after-life known as the vortex.  Zed - as the story will show - has already been infected with some form of heresy that Zardoz is not what he seems to be.

Thanks to a pre-credits monolog, we already know that Zardoz is a false god, an alter-ego of Arthur Frayn - himself a magician by inclination, and immortal by association.  Frayn belongs to that other surviving branch of humanity, the undying and telepathic ""Eternals"".  Ruled by a new age computer called the Tabernacle, Eternals use Zardoz to make pawns of the Brutals, who in turn harvest the world and feed them.  Otherwise protected from the Brutals' world by an impenetrable field, the Eternals live an apparently idyllic yet emotionally and physiologically impotent existence within a reserve ironically known as ""The Vortex"".  The Eternals would just as soon kill Zed, holding him little higher than an ape.  However linked by the Tabernacle, dissension in the ranks over what to do with Zed allows him to learn the secret of the Eternals' existence and destroy it, while himself evolving beyond his murderously wanton origins.  It turns out that the immortals have had enough of their lifeless survival, and now long for death (or at least mortality).  But what force drives Zed, and what turned him against Zardoz?

It's hard to answer those questions, because so much of this movie is incomprehensible (including how many of the plot's enigmas were intentional).  The script is full of laughably arch dialog and self-aware or simply laughable imagery.  (You may recall a movie starring Sean Connery running around in a red diaper, wondering what that movie was - ""Zardoz"" endeth the lesson!)  All the costuming is laughable, consecutive scenes don't lead into each other, the society of the Eternals is never really explained (the Eternals are immortal, yet not quite indestructible; it's never clear just how the Eternals are trapped into immortality) and there's way too much interest in the male anatomy.  Worse than that, the movie is incredibly slow, and it's often difficult to understand just what's going on.

Yet, ""Zardoz"", for all of it's arch self-awareness is still a cut above Boorman's other losers.  It still doesn't touch ""Excalibur"", though it does hint at Boorman's interest in Arthurian legend, with its rural and pre-modern looking settings, the Eternals at one point gathered at a round table; Zed's search inverts the legend of the Holy Grail - he seeks the cup that destroys immortality.  Despite its flaws, the flick never loses its sense of enigma, and though it pains me to say, I found the overwhelming desire of the Eternals to die (and their ultimate denoument) gave the story an emotional coherence that nearly makes you forget everything laughably bad about the movie.",1159488000,19,3605,5.0134228187919465

Based as a world of outlanders and the society, Zardoz plays more on the class differences and higher society comming together to ""set the standards"" and control or crush everything else. Connery plays a ""brutal"" from outside the Vortex, which is a society set up by elite in which science and itellectuals combined to explore the human potential and eventually gain inmortality.  These intellectuals prey on the outsiders to gain supplies by using ""zardoz"", a flying large head.

350887,4,6301744128,"I like all of John Boorman's movies. He has a way of capturing the essence of a time and place; even when it's not one we are familiar with. And he has done that very well with ZARDOZ.

The plot of ZARDOZ is fairly simple but has a few niches along the way. It goes like this:

Man strives to create utopia for his privileged society. And he thinks he has succeeded. Alas, the best-laid plans of men, etc. Utopia does not turn out as expected and things are going awry for the privileged class. Of course there are Outsiders -- the ""Brutals"" -- which are not so privileged. It is through an outsider (Sean Connery/Zed) that a few of the privileged attempt to rectify their situation by allowing him inside the vortex (where the privileged live). That, of course, is a simplistic view of the plot.

In a way, it is not unlike a super-power (the U.S.?) keeping the Brutals (the Terrorists?) at bay. But there are always those that are not satisfied with the status quo.

There is more going on in this movie than meets the eye and it is difficult to keep track of some of the niches. One must put together the pieces in order to follow what is happening at any particular time as well as why it is happening. That is one of the things I liked about the movie: the sum of the parts were greater than the ending. You may have to watch the movie more than once to put the parts together.

Some reviewers have criticized the cheesy special effects. Well, this is not Star Wars or The Matrix. It is not even that technically advanced of a world. Not the way we know it. It is a different type of technology and a different culture. That's another thing I liked about it. It was a new and different kind of world. And Zed brought distress and disturbance into this world. That's what made the movie exciting for me: Zed's insurgence into the vortex was an adventure of the mind as well as the body. He upset and changed the world of the privileged as he himself was changed by his interactions with them. So the end was expected, and yet, it was not.",1147478400,3,2042,4.307291666666667

350889,5,6301744128,"Sean Connery made this movie after his Bond franchise died.  This came out a few years after ""Diamonds are Forever"".  Connery was in the '83 ""Never say Never Again"" but that's not considered a true Bond movie.  But, I degress, we're talking about ZARDOZ.

I give the movie five stars.  It's one of those mid-1970s science fiction movies that has cheezy effects, cheezy dialog, and is fun to watch if you've had a few shots of whiskey on ice.  Four years later ""Star Wars"" came out.  That is how much movies changed in a short time.

Connery is part of a group of killers turned farmers who must till the earth and put food in the mouth of ZARDOZ, a flying head that goes from place to place collecting grain to feed the immortal humans in the Vortex.  Connery plays ""Zed"", a mutant (they don't really say what sort of mutant he is) who used to rape and murder to his hearts content until being forced to become a farmer.  When ZARDOZ comes on a grain collection Zed is buried under grain and inside of the grain slips into the Vortex.

The Vortex is the area where the immortals live.  It's not easy to figure out.  I've watched this movie three or four times and it shows the Vortex, a simple English village, is protected by a shield.  How is the shield maintained?  We don't know.  You look around the Vortex compound and nothing there looks like technology that has advanced past 1820.  There are some plastic things for growing plants.  They look as out of place as a plastic bean bag chairs in the middle of a castle.

Zed's job is easy.  He must figure out a way to bring down the invisible walls of the Vortex so his band of marauders can take vengence on the inhabitants.  The killers must have revenge for being forced to become farmers.

In some ways I look at this movie as an analog of what is going on in modern Europe.  The present inhabitants of Europe are bored with life.  They believe in nothing.  They do nothing.  So, they invite in Muslims with the full knowledge the aim of that group is to transform Europe to something alien to a European.

Zardoz is quite like that.  Zed is brought in and most everybody knows he will be the death of them.  This is something new to modern people; we invite in the very people who wish to wreck the society we helped build.  Anyway, Zed destroys the Vortex mainframe computer.  This part is done by having a crystal computer ""suck"" Zed into it.  The acting and effects at this part of the movie seem like Velveta is all over the place; it's all just so cheezy.  The producers of the movie enlarges a photo of a diamond and Connery just holds up his hands and ""falls"" into the crystal.  Perhaps I should be less judgemental about modern computer graphics.

Now, until the final conflict with the crystal computer there are lots of stupid things a person will see.  You'll see raiders riding horses and shooting guns with an unlimited supply of ammo; the first job of the raiders was to reduce the population of humans before farming could start.  You'll see thin nude British actresses throwing themselves at everybody and any thing.  (Did Connery go through a divorce at this time?  I can see why.)  Note, the women are not ""Bond"" girls.  So the nudity is not sexy.  You'll see the flying head of ZARDOZ who collects food.  How he forces the collection of food is not explained.  How this head of rock flies is also not explained.  Anti-gravity?  We don't know and are not told.

I give the movie five stars and I simply don't know why?  It's entertaining.  Also, the over six foot tall Connery looks like a near ape when standing to the 5'7"" and thin-as-reeds British actors.  I don't think any of the women weigh more than 110 pounds, 140 for the men.  It's a great snap shot of how thin the British people used to be in the immediate post WWII era.  John Lennon was a peer of this group.  They were all so thin (or we are now all so fat).

Oh heck get the movie.  It's not bad on discount.  You'll enjoy it.  There isn't any politics to piss you off.  There is a somewhat good story.  It's mindless and fun entertainment.  I enjoy it.

I remember seeing it fairly often on weekend afternoon television in the '80s, probably because then as now it's main attraction was Sean Connery and it was dirt cheap.  It's only been fairly recently, however, that I've seen it all in one setting.

The movie is often unfathomable, since we're relying on visual imagery to convey much of it rather than explanation.  I actually think Zardoz's main flaw is it tries too much to play like a science fiction novel.  Ideas and scnarios that are plausible in print don't translate very well on screen.

And as the movie was made on a low budget in the early seventies, tie dyed shrouds, clear sheet plastic, and lighted patterns on people's bodies pass for what would today be CGI effects.  The appearance is certainly unique, and I used to liken it to the result of Hippies making science fiction.

That said, what is the point to watching it?  Simply, it has very deep ideas about immortality and the meaning or value of life, and may have to be viewed more than once to ""get"" it.  In several scences it appears that even Connery and Charlotte Rampling are doing their best to perform the material, but not having a clue what they're supposed to be expressing.

 That said, Zardoz isn't a good movie either.  The cheese factor is pimpled all over the ugly face of this feature, and a seemingly well-constructed plot is somehow executed poorly.  I blame the directing on this.  Zardoz is simply far too funky and esoteric in its delivery to be taken seriously.  This may be quite the head trip (no doubt a hefty reason for it's cult following), but that in itself becomes the movie's biggest detriment, as a neat storyline is beaten back into a state of little relevance.

 The already mentioned cheese factor is due to the over-the-top absurdity which is portrayed in Zardoz.  This surfaces right in the first 10 minutes of the movie.  I simply couldn't accept the fact that I was watching a giant, flying, stone head giving a sermon on the evils of the penis before puking forth enough machine guns from its mouth to equip an army.  And I'm not really sure I needed to see science specimen, Sean Connery being subjected to slightly pornographic videos in order to see what was required to give him an erection (I am not making this up.  I told you this movie was bizarre).

 Despite hating this movie, I actually recommend renting it, should you ever come across it.  Unless you're suffering from schizophrenia, it's definitely unlike anything you've ever experienced before (it makes even the most intense LSD trip seem like cheap reefer high).  Who knows, maybe you'll end up joining the Zardoz cult as well.  I sure as Hell know I didn't, but still I recommend renting it for at least one viewing.

I had expected to find a much lower turn out on this film, but considering its 30 years old, perhaps it has built a fan base of sorts.  If you've read other reviews, you'll get more of an in-depth synopsis of the plot then you will from me.  However, I will help those who have only seen the highly confusing and strange trailer as I did before I went and saw this.  (The trailer is really no help at all describing this movie, it only makes sense AFTER watching the film).  To sum up, Earth has had some sort of cataclysm, its the future, there are 2 species of human (not unlike the H.G. Wells' ""time machine"") One is mortal, the other is eternal.  The interaction between the two ""races"" via Sean Connery's character ""zed"" is the main plot thread.  The movie attempts to bring in a huge array of ideas about life and death.  The role time and nature play with, and against, humanity.  It does try to take on these issues seriously, but there are some things that get in the way.  The first is the crappy special effects and wardrobe (okay, most of the cast is topless, half naked, or close to it.  Normally not a problem, but this is before silicon, tanning booths and other plastic surgery.... and these girls are homely lookin' brits...hoofa.)  Also, its a sci-fi piece, and for the topics and ideas being tackled, the props supporting all this were really just awful.  I had to watch sean connery run around a funhouse ""hall of mirrors"" for 5 minutes and got bored with him as he tried to escape the script.  The overall idea behind this movie isn't bad, the execution had ALOT to be desired.  I believe this is one of the few times a remake might actually make a movie better, given today's calibur of special effects.  After all, if George Lucas had envisioned Star Wars in 1920, with its scratchy film quality, black and white film, and non existant fx, would it have made as good a story? Probably not.  Zardoz is a good story waiting to be told with better special effects. 2 stars, good ideas, bad execution.  Sean Connery does well, but it really plays like a giant goofy episode of Dr. Who.

350985,4,6301744128,"`Zardoz' was produced, written, and directed by John Boorman who, like Robert Altman (`M.A.S.H') and Ken Russell (`Women In Love') cash in their credit earned from directing very successful commercial films and spend it to direct very personal, very original, and very uncommercial films. `Zardoz' was made right after Boorman's immense critical and commercial success with `Deliverance' and his star in that movie, Burt Reynolds, was to play the lead role in `Zardoz' until Burt fell ill and was replaced with Sean Connery at a cost of 1/5 of the whole million dollar budget. As high as that relative figure may seem, apparently Connery was just finishing up his appearances as James Bond and no one would hire him for anything else, so he needed the money.

While there is a great danger that no one will ever read this review, it is immense fun to write a review of this rich, quirky, and very flawed movie. For starters, I find it easy to see that people have a hard time understanding the movie. I have never held that fact alone against a movie, as it took me at least three viewings of `2001 A Space Odyssey' to feel I was anywhere near understanding it, and `2001' has taken its rightful place among the very best American movies. It has taken me at least that many viewings to understand some of Fredrico Fellini's movies and I still don't understand `8'. But that doesn't mean this is not a great movie. But that doesn't mean this is a great movie. It only means it has potential the fact that it can still be found on the store shelves is a testament to the fact that this movie has a lot to offer, even if it ultimately does not fully realize the filmmaker's vision.

There are few movies I have seen which are more in need of the director's commentary than this one. One of Boorman's most telling observations on this commentary is the statement that there may just be too much being attempted in this movie. And, I think this summarizes the problem in a nutshell.

Like all true science fiction works, the heart of `Zardoz' is to set the stage by imagining `what would happen if this statement were true'? The central premise of the movie is the fact that some cataclysm destroyed the world as we know it and, not unlike H. G. Wells' `The Time Machine', humankind has split into two major subspecies, one of which is effectively immortal and the other barely survives on a subsistence level and who treat an artifact of the immortals as a god named `Zardoz'. In addition to being immortal, the higher level beings can communicate telepathically and can control lower level beings by the force of mind alone.

Some of the implications the filmmaker draws from this central premise are truly inspired. By far the most brilliant is the inference that the immortals can suffer from debilitating boredom. To imagine how easy this can happen, just imagine a conventional image of heaven where the primary activities are singing and playing an archaic musical instrument.

Another inspired implication is the fact that the immortals are punished by being aged a certain number of years, so that when they are treated to restore their youth, they never grow any younger than their penal age. These two implications lead to two subgroups. These are immortals who become totally immobilized by ennui and immortals who age to the point of debilitation. If the movie stopped there, it could probably have easily filled its two hours with a rich explication of all these suppositions.

The problem is that to make the story interesting, the storyteller must bring a mortal into the immortals' world to shake things up. The problem I have with the device Boorman uses to bring Connery's mortal character into the immortals' world really doesn't seem to work very well. This element of the story all revolves around the premise that the mortals are being suppressed by a myth based on the story of the Wizard of Oz. This myth is so central to the story that the title of the movie and the name of the deity itself comes from a contraction of `wiZARD of OZ'. Connery's character, `Zed', with the help of his fellow mortal `brutals' manages to get aboard the great stone head which embodies Zardoz' after Zed discovers the fact that the great and mighty `Zardoz' is, like the fictional wizard, a sham. My biggest problem is that the analogy between this future earth and the Land of Oz is very, very thin. There is no explanation I can fathom for why the mortals are divided into two classes, one of which, the `brutals' like Zed spend all their time, catching, raping, and killing the other mortal class. This situation remits somewhat when we see the brutals acting as overseers while the other mortals spend time planting crops, but this subplot is simply not very well developed.

The primary thread of the story is in the contention between two immortals over what to do with Zed. The `scientist' who wishes to study Zed wins a vote to keep him alive for 21 days. In the course of this period, Zed manages to stir up the world of the immortals and do a lot to bring some real interest to their life.

As the movie was done very cheaply in the early 1970's, today's computer based effects simply did not exist and the `on camera' effects are a bit threadbare, not unlike the curtain behind which the Midwestern huckster manipulates the image of the Wizard of Oz. And yet this does not detract from the movie. The film mostly suffers from too much implausibility and, to paraphrase the Austrian Emperor's comments on Mozart's music in `Amadeus', there are `simply too many ideas'.

An yet, this is a really worthwhile movie to see, enhanced by medieval music expert David Munro's score.",1112054400,214,5686,4.683683683683683
351046,2,6301744128,"Movie: *1/2  DVD Quality: ***1/2  DVD Extras: **

The first five minutes of ""Zardoz"" promise a lot of campy fun as a giant stone head flies through the sky, then lands as a voice intones, ""The penis is evil.""  Shortly thereafter, Sean Connery shows up sporting a huge Fu Manchu moustache and a waist-length ponytail, clothed in a bikini bottom and hip boots, and the audience knows it is in for a good time in the vein of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" or ""Flesh Gordon"".  But as the movie drones on, it all too soon becomes apparent that this nonsense is supposed to be taken seriously as science fiction and even purports to have A Deeper Cosmic Meaning ... that no one is meant to laugh when Mr. Connery appears in drag as a bride, or fights his way out of a giant plastic Baggie.  A very, v-e-r-y l-o-n-g 106 minutes passes before the end title flashes across the screen, leaving the audience to ponder the eternal question, ""Huh?""

The only aspect of the movie that comes off as intended are the art direction and cinematography.  John Boorman films are typically a feast for the eyes, and ""Zardoz"" is no exception.  The rest of the film is negligible.  The script, the performances, the music, the editing, the direction ... everything is subpar.  The Fox DVD offers an acceptable transfer of the film, with generally clear sound and crisp video.  The DVD extras are so-so; director John Boorman's commentary is interesting and helpful in terms of trying to interpret what's happening in the narrative, but the Stills Gallery is small and uninteresting, and the Theatrical Trailer and Radio Spots are as silly as the film itself.

351047,2,6301744128,"Zardoz (John Boorman, 1974)

Poor John Boorman. In 1974, he was on top of the world. He'd delivered (no pun intended) Deliverance two years previous, and it was not only a critical success, but a box-office success as well. And it got him nominated for Best Director and Best Picture. Yep, John Boorman was someone in Hollywood.

Then came Zardoz.

Zardoz is not a film so much as it is a bad erotic dream that happens after taking a good deal of LSD. The psyche of the dreamer seems to involve a good deal of leather fetishism, a fondness for orgies, some well-repressed rape fantasy, and, well, a thing for stone heads.

Zed (Sean Connery) is an Exterminator for the god Zardoz, tasked with the job of hunting down and killing ""brutals"" (i.e., other humans). Zardoz' opening monologue explaining this to the viewer (for, obviously, the exterminators are already aware of this philosophy, else they wouldn't be exterminators) is absolutely hysterical, and must be heard to be believed. (Those without a strong stomach can hear it sampled, in its entirety, on Terror Organ's Buzzbomb CD.) We cut, and very badly mind you, to a shot of Zed emerging from a pile of something inside the stone head, which transports him (after certain minor adventures) to the Vortex, where Zardoz lives. Zed must explore the world of the Vortex, and adapt to life there, and the life in the Vortex must adapt to him.

Comparisons are made to most of the usual suspects (all contemporary science fiction films, of course, most notably Rollerball), but what I was reminded of more often than not was John Frankenheimer's brilliant picture of a decade previous, Seconds. Except that Seconds made a good deal more sense, but didn't have anywhere near as much nudity.

There are some decent performances at times, but no one here stays at a top level throughout. The closest actor to achieving that is John Alderton (recently seen in Calendar Girls), who plays his role with a kind of cynical amusement. The other two main characters are played by Charlotte Rampling (Swimming Pool, The Statement) and Sara Kestelman (Invasion: Earth) as a pair of women who can't agree on what should be done with Zed. Which is all well and good, until close to the climax, when Boorman (who also wrote the script) seems to get the two mixed up. From there, things break down rather rapidly from what was already a pretty precarious position.

There are certainly worse movies out there. (If you want to see a real science fiction howler, check out the filmed version of Michael Moorcock's The Final Programme; I think everyone on that set, not just the director, had gotten some excellent LSD.) But there are also many thousands that are far better. Zardoz is a curiosity, a film that attempts to invest fevre dreams with great meaning. It's been done far better. **",1104883200,9,2827,4.780737704918033
351048,4,6301744128,"There has never been any other movie like this one. I still remember the first time I watched it.

At first, I snickered at the disembodied head with the magic-marker mustache and goatee.

Then I saw the giant stone head, zipping along in midair like some dream of Terry Gilliam's, and I started laughing uncontrollably. I mean _tears_ were streaming down my cheeks.

And then the durned thing _spoke_. 'The gun is good. . . . The penis is evil. . . . ' And it started vomiting up rifles. By now I had my hanky out.

And then Zed showed up in his red diaper and hip boots. And I thought: oh, boy, now I see why Sean Connery gave up the role of James Bond; it was so that he could be taken more seriously as an actor.

The whole movie is like that. It's like an unusually preposterous episode of the original _Star Trek_, without any of the original cast. (And the Rod Serling-like 'surprise' -- a bit over an hour into the film -- won't be a surprise at all if you've already figured it out from the film's title.)

But it's not just a 'bad' film. John Boorman (of _Deliverance_ fame) really did have a good idea here, and you might be able to extract it if you can see it through the cheese.

In fact, once you grok that the thing is a big SF morality play (essentially posing the question whether it's better to be immortal or to be Sean Connery), you'll probably think it would have been even _more_ at home on the original _Star Trek_. (And you may like it for that reason alone -- if your favorite episodes were 'Let That Be Your Last Battlefield', 'The Apple', and 'The Gamesters of Triskelion'.)

Connery and Charlotte Rampling save the day as far as the acting is concerned; Connery has an uncanny knack for being believable in whatever role he plays, and Rampling is a slow-burning fire.

Zed stows away in Zardoz's mouth and sneaks into the ""vortex"" wherein live the ruling class of the planet, extremely bored by their immortality.

This is a must for Sean Connery fans; he sports a cool long ponytail & mustache and prances around in a skimpy futuristic outfit throughout the film.

As for me, I didn't buy the dvd for Connery, but rather for the super sharp Charlotte Rampling (catch her in the underrated ""Orca -- the Killer Whale"").

The cinematography, locations, score, sets, costumes and special effects are all pretty much first rate for the time period (1974), just don't expect ""Star Wars"" class F/X. In fact, the flick's worth seeing for the Irish scenery alone.

Recently, the serendipity of watching The Swimmng Pool with Charlotte Rampling suggested giving this Boorman allegory another chance. I finally get it and had fun seeing it again. Three reasons to watch Zardoz are John Boorman's emerging vision and personal iconography, the power of Sean Connery's presence and acting (especially at the point in his career when he was trying to break from the Bond type-cast), and Geoffrey Unsworth's masterful photography.

Boorman and his actors put their hearts and talent on the line. Connery pulls off wearing the red loincloth and wedding dress, pulling a rickshaw and effectively performing scenes like the lecture on libido with subtle irony. Charlotte Rampling, Sara Kestelman, and other actresses can survive wearing go-go boots or performing nude while portraying strong women in conflict reacting to Zed's mojo. The whole cast of immortals are such good actors that you can giggle about the horror of wearing macram' tops and overly foofed hair, but they suspend your belief in the nightmare society these characters have created. Unsworth not only films this movie; he validates the vision with clear images that indulges Boorman's penchant for setting archetypes and going all Jungian on us. It is beautiful to watch and mostly poetic.

Boorman stuffs the movie with cinematic references like Welles and Peckinpah, much like the immortals have stuffed their museum. In his commentary, he admits putting too much in the film and that he would do things differently with more money and experience. At the beginning, there are moments that almost feel like Monty Python's Holy Grail or Woody Allen's Sleeper, but the movie progresses past that. The set design was interesting, but I felt that the costuming was just a little too groovy. He also admits that some of this cult classic is laughable, but the actors and the camera take it seriously enough to trap us in the Vortex and follow Zed as he searches for the truth. I am a sucker for personal films, and everybody involved made this personal to their truth.

Given what has been going on in Silicon Valley, Zardoz is still very pertinent. The irony is that celluloid projections on glass, superimposed images on film and light refracting from faceted crystals simulated computers, which were used to depict John Boorman's vision of 2293.  In any remake, instead of green bread, Boorman's successor would have to direct the brutals in assembling green pizzas, and a notion of a religious mystery commanding the terminators would be named by the corruption of the phrase - Stock Option.  Their god would be called Ckoption.  Nyahhh!  Just watch Zardoz.",1090022400,5,2808,5.05183585313175

The opening fifteen minutes are among the most memorable: Boorman begins the movie with numerous striking compositions (greatly enhanced by this pristine DVD edition), and a dreamlike, largely silent progression which highlights his storytelling talent; Zed's 'learning sequence', later in the film, is also remarkably put together. The main character's quest for truth and knowledge is mostly compelling, but brought down a bit by Boorman's simplistic, rarely subtle views on sexuality and spirituality. On the other hand, his use of mythology, classical art and fairy tales is adept and intelligent, and the twist he gives to the Indo-European functional tripartition famously noted by Georges Dumezil (sovereign-religious / physical strength-war / fecundity) is quite provocative.

351106,4,6301744128,"John Boorman's outr film ZARDOZ (1974) is a somewhat campy but visually stunning science-fiction dystopian fantasy set in the distant future.  Sporting a ponytail, a red diaper-like loincloth, bandoliers, and thigh-high gold-digger boots, actor Sean Connery plays an clever barbarian who, on the order of his ""god"" Zardoz, invades The Vortex, an enclave of cultured academics and aesthetes who have grown intellectually stagnant and morally depraved after their many years of isolation from the rest of the world.
Writer/director Boorman is probably best known as the director of DELIVERANCE, James Dickey's screen adaptation of his literate and highly acclaimed novel.  While DELIVERANCE is a fairly straightforward story of a clash between a group of northern city dwellers and a clan of depraved backwoodsy southerners, Boorman's ZARDOZ is a deep and complex film that requires viewers to peel back its many layers and ruminate over what they find.  The lush cinematography, dazzling visuals, and quirky humor just make up the faade.  Underneath is an intricate and sometimes abstruse ontological parable that addresses the nature of reality, class struggle, and the individual's responsibility to society (and vice versa).  Thrown into the mix are subtle satirical comments about religion, politics, science, and academics.  ZARDOZ is not an audience-friendly movie; it requires the viewer to pay attention and think.  In fact, it may take repeated viewings to catch all the symbolism and subtext and thereby understand the film's full meaning.  So those who prefer to have their movie themes spoon-fed to them probably won't enjoy ZARDOZ, but those who like for films to stimulate the gray matter--most notably SF fans--should find the film quite entertaining and satisfying.
The acting in the film is a mixed bag, but the principals, especially Connery and Charlotte Rampling, generally do an outstanding job.  In a role that is a far cry from his sophisticated and charming James Bond, Connery is very convincing as an intelligent brute who has a difficult time wrapping his head around the philosophy of the denizens of The Vortex.  (Some film historians have surmised that Connery's character is a personification of socio-political conservatism, whereas The Vortex folks are philosophically diametric and therefore represent liberalist ideals.) And Ms. Rampling provides sexual tension as a Vortex woman who is physically attracted to Connery but repulsed by what he represents.
The DVD version of this cult classic, from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, is nothing short of outstanding.  The film is offered in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and the anamorphic widescreen digital transfer is simply beautiful, with few (if any) noticeable filmic or digital artifacts.  Extras include the original theatrical trailer--which blatantly reflects the sensibilities of the post-60s hippie youth of the early 70s--and some radio spots narrated by Rod Serling of THE TWILIGHT ZONE fame.  Also available is a feature commentary from writer/director Boorman.  (The commentary is interesting, though Boorman's delivery is sometimes halting.)
In short, ZARDOZ is a fascinating SF film that will appeal to the aesthete and the intellectual (i.e., the simple-minded should steer clear).  And it's delightful that the DVD age can rescue this oft misunderstood cult film from obscurity and make it available to its fans in its original format.

351108,4,6301744128,"So asks Arthur Frayn, alias the god Zardoz, as his disembodied head floats before us and invites us to be entertained by Zardoz, a 1974 film directed by John Boorman, starring Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling.
Arthur Frayn loves magic tricks and says Merlin is his hero.  (Did Frayn take the name of Merlin's heroic protege for himself?)
We are, as a subtitle tells us, in the twenty-third century.  Here the Eternals live inside Vortex 4, a perfect English village by a lake.  In the Vortex there is no death, thanks to a device called the Tabernacle, which takes the memories of an Eternal and implants them into a new fetus should the Eternal be unlucky enough to die in an accident or bored enough to take his or her own life.
That is, there is no death until Zed, one of the Brutals who live outside the Vortex, finds his way inside.  Zed is strong, hypermasculine, and sexually active - -  everything the Eternals no longer are.
In science fiction movies the future often looks like the present with one or two strange elements thrown in.  But in the Vortex the clothes, buildings, and even the scientific instruments are so unlike ours as to make us believe we are watching a far future with little connection to our own life.  Even more strange than their accoutrements is the way the Eternals speak and move.  Barely perceptible movements and gestures are part of their language.
However details outside the Vortex bring this world closer to us.  The clothes the Brutals wear are dirty and torn twentieth-century fashions.  The Brutals live like barbarians huddled around fires in a town with an abandoned ruin that was once a municipal library.
In the Vortex not everyone is content.  There are renegades, those whose negative thoughts disrupt the Eternals' perfection.  The renegades are allowed to age but not die.  They are the oldest Eternals.
Besides the renegades, there is another group, the apathetics.  They barely move or respond.  The Eternals are worried because this disease is spreading throughout the Vortex.  So the equilibrium of the Vortex is deteriorating before Zed arrives.
Friend, an Eternal, wants to know from Zed what happened to Arthur Frayn, with whom Friend has been conspiring.  But Zed can block his thoughts from Friend and from May, the scientist who gets permission to study Zed for a time before killing him.
By the time Friend and May learn what happened to Arthur Frayn and what Zed is it's too late to save Utopia.  Finally, Zed learns what brought Utopia into being.
The renegades are the scientists, politicians, and millionaires who built the Vortex to save themselves and their children from the chaos destroying the outside world.  But they were too old to adapt to eternal life and after the centuries went mad.  Their spoiled, effete children now rule in the Vortex and it is they who are succumbing to apathy from the lack of a need to struggle for their existence.
The Vortex is not a distant, horrible future.  It's the horrible present.  The Eternals are literally us - -  the generation that saw Zardoz in 1974, the children of the generation that first built the terrible weapons and created the rapacious society that caused the apocalypse.  We are the children of the renegades.
In 1974 Boorman was describing the generation he saw inheriting the world.  The message isn't that original - -  life thrives because of the reality of death.  The living feed off the dead and it's the prospect of death that inspires creativity.  Sex and violence, no matter how much we might prefer otherwise, are related.
The elite who saw their (our) society crumbling around them, who felt the new Dark Ages coming, sealed themselves off the rest of the world and its lower classes.  As in so-called advanced societies today a minority took most of the world's resources and left the majority of the world's people to fend for themselves.  Then this elite justified their greed and lack of concern for how their behavior would affect the rest of the planet by claiming they had a duty to survive, in order to preserve and transmit the glories of human history.
When the reborn Arthur Frayn returns to Friend, as they joyfully face the end of their world, they realize it's all been a joke, a story told by an idiot.  They, like us, have been ""confused . . .  and abused . . . and amused.""",1079395200,10,4336,4.74
351109,5,6301744128,"No matter how critical an attitude I bring to it, I simply cannot dislike this film!  Its premises, performances, and images are a godsend to a lover of ""thinking person's"" science fiction.  I have no idea what previous reviewers mean when they talk of a hippie sensibility pervading the film.  I saw it twice during its initial release and have just seen it again after twenty some odd years; it still holds its special relevance and the satire still connects.  Plus, it's a pleasure watching a science fiction film without a surfeit of gratuitous computer generated effects.  Most of the story is told with the use of splendid cinematography, interesting sets, and a simple straightforward script with a few compelling twists.  Some may argue that the actors' lines are trite; they are, but to wonderful biting effect.  The masks worn by the Exterminators are marvelous, as is the floating head of Zardoz.  The aerial photography and sound effects are also used to great effect near the beginning of the film to set the stage for the entrance into the Vortex and Zed's ""big boy adventure"" among the Immortals.  Though Sean Connery's Zed chews most of the scenery, my favorite character was Friend played by John Alderton, especially after he received his sentence and was banished to the world of the aging Renegades.  Hilarious!  Even the time lapse ending was effective.  Normally this device is used as a crutch for a filmmaker simply because he/she doesn't know how to develop a denouement.  Not here; it works perfectly!

This DVD release is crisp and vibrant with stunningly saturated colors and fine sound.  I concur with a previous reviewer; this has to be the finest use of the Second Movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony ever in a film, heard in both it's original scoring and in a special choral arrangement--slow, stately and at a funeral march tempo, the way it should be despite the composer's score markings!  I haven't heard the director's narrative track and am in no hurry to do so; the film speaks well for itself.

In my opinion, this rightfully ranks as a ""must have"" for fans of lovingly-made, imaginative, and thought-provoking films.  Bring an open mind and a sense of humor along with the popcorn; you're in for a treat!",1075852800,11,2251,4.863517060367454

I will say this , as a Connery Fan ( are we not all really Connery fans deep inside) I saw this as a must see and since it was butchered by the good people of the Sci-Fi channel , I only saw about half of it before switching to Marnie on HBO. Yet , the half I did veiw was rather smart and Mrs. Rampaling was breathtaking in her youth. Boorman has better films that have helped elevate him to the peak of post sixties British cinema .

At worst, I'd say it's a spectacularly, interesting failure.  I feel for it, because it's the kind of movie I would have wanted to make if you'd given me a film camera and a million bucks at age 14.  It's full of big ideas, grand scope, science fiction ambitions, action, and sex, and kind of the smarty pants ideas, but Zardoz has absolutely no maturity, taste, or sense of propotion whatsover.  Most movies these days take no chances, and won't try anything that won't be perfect, whereas this thing is one of those films that's just all over the map, and has a lot of it flubs, but occasionally it gets a few things right.  It's got a ton of that screwball 70's new-agey 'ooh we've just discovered LSD and we're sooo open-minded' kind of lunacy that's interesting from a historical perspective.  The action and violence is a little clumsy, which considering Deliverance, doesn't make much sense.  I assume it was rushed a little bit. The DVD is beautiful.  Amazing print.  Probably didn't look as good in the theater.
If you're new to the 70's new-agey, big profound over-the-top ideas sci-fi, the film to start with is probably not Zardoz, but rather Logan's Run, which covers approximately similar territory, but which, to me at least, ends better, among other things.",1072051200,3,1443,4.664031620553359

Sean Connery didn't want to be type-cast as James Bond, so he did this film as a change of pace. Now he'll be type-cast as a brutal savage running around in go-go boots, with a paper-mache' helmet with the face of Zardoz on it, shooting everybody he sees. This film reminded me of an episode of the Prisoner, with Zed being taken into the ""Village"" and interrogated like a rogue agent that has gone awry. By the end of the movie, I felt like one of the Eternals, just praying for death. My girlfriend bought me this movie and agreed with me that it was worse than Wing Commander. Yes, she admits to seeing Wing Commander. Anyway, when the trailer is better than the movie itself, and the back of the DVD case is better than the trailer, this movie is best left on the shelf.

351114,4,6301744128,"This movie is an interesting extrapolation of what might have happened a couple hundred of years in the future if a bizarre conjunction of events occurred.
The vast majority of the world has been destroyed.  How the world was destroyed was never explained, but we see that most of the world is barren and smoking.  Most buildings are ruined.  People run like cattle from a selected few called exterminators, whose sole mission is to kill anyone they find.
All has not been lost, however.  There are enclaves of people living in sanctuaries, each called a Vortex.  These sanctuaries are protected from the outside world by force fields.  Inside the sanctuary the people study and are well fed.  They have developed mental abilities, including telepathy and some telekinesis.  Most importantly, they are apparently immortal.  There are only two downsides to this utopia.  First, these people have lost all interest in physical love.  Second, a number of these people are so apathetic that they have become like walking dead, devoid of energy and purpose, nearly comatose.
Our story focuses on Zed, played by Sean Connery.  Zed is an exterminator who manages to penetrate a Vortex by boarding the giant floating head known as Zardoz.  Once Zed penetrates the Vortex, he finds that he was actually bred to be the savior of the residents of the Vortex (you'll have to watch and find out what he is supposed to do, and whether he does it).  We learn the origin of the Vortex and follow Zed as he reaches his destiny, as well as that of the people of the Vortex.
The Vortex itself is a socialistic, apparently matriarchal, society.  The general appearance and behavior of the residents is as though they were transported from the 1960s into the future.  The touching and feeling techniques, the psychedelic special effects, and the generally communal nature of the Vortex all bespeak of the utopia that the flower children of the 60s were hoping to achieve.  However, as the advertisements for the movie state, I have seen the future and it does not work.  Truer words were never spoken.  The citizens of utopia have accomplished nothing, and in general appear to be regressing and petty rather than advancing.  Thus, the movie satirizes the society that was held as the ideal of the 60s.
In general the movie is somewhat dated by the now-crude special effects.  However, as a vision of the future, the movie accomplishes much.  While there are a few plot holes, most of them can be ignored as you follow Zed in his quest for knowledge.  I've seen the term ""cerebral science fiction"" used for this movie, and find it appropriate.  This movie falls into the narrow class of movie occupied by a few others such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Dark City,"" and ""The Game.""  You are intended to look for the meanings and satire in this movie, of which there is much.
This movie was one of the best movies I had seen prior to ""Star Wars,"" and continues to be one of my favorites.  I recommend this movie to those who like quirky, bizarre and unusual films.  It's quite good if you can get into it, but incomprehensible and confused if you can not.  Borrow it from a friend before you buy it.",1062201600,8,3175,4.713248638838476
351115,3,6301744128,"The original ad says it all -- I have seen the future and it doesn't work (perhaps it's unemployed). I have an original 1/2 sheet movie poster of Zardoz hanging in my study. Boorman's first film after the successful Deliverance is an odd mixture of satire and science fiction. While visually stunning, the muddled narrative can be a blessing in disguise; it allows you to look past the poorly thought out plot and appreciate it for what it is; the first and only Monty Python sci-fi film.
The very elements that make this film at times absurd also make it a classic; the literary allusion to The Wizard of Oz; the great stone head of the god Zardoz floating around the Irish countryside; Zed's attempt to destroy the ""heart"" of the peaceful community he invades. There's a campy quality that runs throughout the film and, no doubt, that was intentional. Boorman's films both great (Deliverance) and bad (The Exorcist 2)are focused on the conflict between the outsider or individual and society or culture surrounding him. Zardoz is a bit more explicit and, yes, pretentious than some of his other work. Nevertheless, Boorman succeeds for the most part. '
Zardoz isn't for everyone and that's no slam. It takes a certain sense of humor and appreciation for well groomed satires to like this film. I'd suggest rening Zardoz and discovering if its you're cup of tea (after all the image of guns spewing forth of the mouth of a ""god"" isn't something we see everyday). It's a savage satire of religion, social norms and the counterculture all nicely rolled into a compact, murky narrative.
The transfer is very good although there are quite a few analog artifacts. The commentary from director John Boorman is quite enlightening and both illuminates as much as it frustrates. Boorman is  articulate and informed. It's clear that even he wasn't quite clear what his ultimate message was. Although Zardoz isn't likely to be remembered as being as groundbreaking as 2001 or Star Wars, it is in the same league in many respects. Just as Kubrick used satire in Strangelove and 2001 (the visual narrative of the film is packed with his satrical spirit), so too Boorman packs his narrative with just as much satire and observation.
It's not a perfect film but for some folks it's perfectly fine despite all it's imperfections.",1061424000,4,2314,4.843434343434343
351184,3,6301744128,"Written, produced and directed by John Boorman, ZARDOZ was a commmercial failure which nevertheless deserves a special place in the hearts of fans of Boorman and Sean Connery. It's not often a talented and respected film maker and actor team up to make one of the strangest and most unintentionally hilarious movies of all time.
The year is 2293. Connery plays Zed; an exterminator for Zardoz which is basically a huge flying stone head which is worshipped as a god. Those who dare to defy or question the 'Dozzman are cast into a ""vortex"" where they prematurely age and never die. Of course Zed has a rebellious streak in him and dares to revolt against Zardoz's view that ""The gun is good, the penis is evil"" and live his life on his own terms in order to retain his precious mortality; a rebellion which could destroy civilisation itself.
While ZARDOZ's elaborate production design is funny today, the ladiesh will no doubt find Connery devashtatingly shexy with hish ponytail and nappiesh; which will aroushe even the mosht dormant of maternal instinctsh. For men there is no shortage of beautiful women in this movie; led by Charlotte Rampling, plus ample female nudity. On the other hand, if you're an intellectual or just have a penchant for the bizzare; then ZARDOZ ought to appeal to the big hard organ located between your ears. This movie was actually much more fun than I expected.

351185,5,6301744128,"This movie was made some time ago (1974) but it became an underground cult classic because of its themes and ideas as well as for some of the performances that were delivered. The movie presents us with Earth far into the future. The world is inhabited by two types of humans: very advanced folk who are immortal and have very powerful technology and world-control, and lesser mortals who are basically horse-riding savages. But one of the savages (Sean Connery) is not so stupid, and he is going to surprise the ""gods"". But not even he is prepared for the truth of his origins and capabilities.

351186,4,6301744128,"I'm not sure if Boorman intended it, but he created a film that describes the eastern concept of Wabi Sabi. Wabi Sabi defines SHIBUI, the non-mechanistic and timeless beauty unrelated to style and so basic that neither time nor change in social values can affect it. It helps us to see through and beyond the dehumanizing climate of technological society and assists in achieving a state of mental equilibrium (a form of enlightenment) in the intensely technological, highly urbanized society of the our times. These concepts are eternal and universal as opposed to the endlessly accelerating change and complications confronting us today. We realize that we are being drained and deprived of something that is not replaceable. Wabi Sabi, therefore, is elegant because of its philosophy of understatement - less is better.

""He who fights a dragon long enough soon becomes one himself"" - not the most typical Sean Connery line, but this is such a way-out film anyway.

351189,4,6301744128,"Zardoz is an extremely heavy-handed social satire.  Like most head movies of the early 1970s, it is worth watching, if for no other reason, than as a relic of a period of time when directors really started experimenting with the medium of film (with quite varied results), e.g. using psychedellic images, etc.  And, like many such films, while it often comes off as pretentious, it is never actually boring.
The society in Zardoz is an analogy for our own and you get a general picture of its setup in the first 20 minutes (so I'm not giving away any surprises).  Sean Connery is part of a gang which is provided with weapons by a flying figure-head (literally speaking).  This gang's role is to go around killing people, raping and pillaging and, consequently, they help control the population and keep it weak.  The rest of the population does things like grow food and give it as offerings to the flying head, partly because it offers some semblance of control over the brutal gangs it created (and maintains) in the first place.
Sean Connery decides to jump on board the flying head for a ride and learns that it is not a god, but a machine built by an elite race of immortals who have all their needs provided for (via the flying head) by the rest of society while they live in leisure.  The immortals also have (exclusive) access to all recorded art and knowledge, but seem incapable of producing any themselves.  In other words, there are clear analogies to inner-city gangs, police states, law and order government, capitalism, media control, and their interdependence.  The rest of the film is then concerned with Connery's interaction with the immortals, learning their weaknesses, etc., and the immortals' reactions to Connery when they realize that he is mentally and physically superior to them when freed from their continued interference and control of the rest of society.  Like I said, rather heavy- handed satire, but definitely not unrealistic.  People from the inner-cities will recognize its accuracy the most.
There are many campy touches, however most (not all) I believe are intentional. And the film has Boorman's usual stunning cinematography.  This film is a cult classic which is at least always interesting if not always good.  And keep in mind that Boorman, that whiz (wink wink), is not being entirely serious.",1025308800,10,2341,4.89873417721519
351190,5,6301744128,"When I was in college, we would watch Zardoz during beer-n-flicks. At the time, it was a cool movie with some naked chicks which we could watch while getting drunk. Then I saw it later in life....
Zardoz was playing at a midnight show and we were the only two people in the theater. Sober this time, I actually watched and understood the film. It deals with life, the futility of immortality, man's creation of his own gods, how all things contain the seed of their own destruction, the inevitability of nature and evolution, how things could become their opposites... I was in awe!
As we walked out, my thoughts were exploding with meaning. I had had an epipheny! I turned to my girlfriend who said: ""that was sure a stupid flick"". I new I had to find a new girlfriend.
This is my favorite movie of all time! I was disappointed with the VHS version as some of the most meaningful scenes (what ""Zardoz"" means, the ending) require wide screen to make sense. After all, who cares what ""ardo"" means? Get the DVD.",1024617600,3,1009,4.489130434782608
351191,3,6301744128,"I remembered seeing this in its theatrical release, and it carried a positive recollection that led me to buy the DVD. Now I can't imagine what I was thinking. Perhaps it was a good film for the era, and we should leave it at that.
The story treads the well-worn path of The Forbin Project and numerous Twilight Zone episodes: can we establish a mechanically enforced Utopia that we'd really want to be stuck in forever? As usual, the answer comes back ""No.""
This film adds immortality to the mix, so that the boredom isn't passed between generations, instead it's piled upon the same group of humans, called the ""Immortals,"" century after century.
One thing that was very successful about the film was the sensuality Boorman managed to convey through the cinematograpy. Moments of nudity were tastefully done, and actually reinforce the asexual overtones of Immortal society. You really got the impression that these people had lived together for so long doing the same old things that NOTHING, not even sex, seemed worth the bother. And there were the legions of ""apathetics"" who hardly bothered to move or feed their bodies any more.
As usual, women in a perfect society all look like supermodels from that film's era (the 70s). Another interesting twist: punishment for transgressions consisted of aging the perpetrator. There was a group of elderly people (shunned of course), but most in the movie looked more or less like 20somethings.
A lot of things devolved predictably from this mix: Connery, the ""barbarian"" outsider, is tasked with saving the soul, if not the body, of Immortal society by making them mortal again and mixing them with the rest of the world. Once this was set up, the only reason I kept watching was because I wanted to see how they worked it out, assuming that would tell me why I thought I liked the movie. This was a trial at times, since Boorman set the pace a touch too slow in places, perhaps to underscore the Immortals' boredom by giving a bit to the audience.
Also, there were a couple of those ""special effects sequences"" of the sort that Hitchcock did in Vertigo and Kubrick overdid in 2001. Boorman, like Kubrick, ran the sequences far longer than necessary.
I like thought provoking films, but there were too many red herrings in Zardoz, things that made no sense. Why was sameness prized and age a stigma, especially after the centuries had rendered physical appearances uninteresting?
In any case, the red herrings can give you an entertaining time -- after all, why else would a 3 star movie be worth all these words?",1021248000,3,2562,4.798642533936651
351192,4,6301744128,"""... why so much pre-Star Wars 70's science fiction is not worth watching ..."" one apparently underage reviewer observes.  Except for Blade Runner and A.I., nearly all Star Wars-and-after science fiction films are simply TV Westerns with spaceships: predictable puerile overloud explosion-filled melodramas about good guys killing bad guys and getting the girl (at their worst, cool dudes killing ... slimeballs and [getting] the hot babe), with adolescent dialogue of snappy put-downs and comebacks, i.e., Nothing New But the FX.  If you find THIS satisfying, I leave you to it.  If you think life is about more than boy-kills-enemy-gets-girl, if you don't need to love the characters in a film or wish to become them, if you can imagine people having other values than you (and other fashions/cliche's/prejudices/needs), if you can see the world and the way many people live as absurd, if you can imagine looking back on anything that is or ever was important to you and seeing it differently (you will when you get old), if you suspect that serious ideas can be approached through absurdity and bravura irony, if you watched A Clockwork Orange for any reason other than vicarious pleasure in the raping and violence ... try this daring movie.  The attacks on it are off-base and beside the point.  Obvious statements?  It may be ""obvious"" that a natural cycle of life is better than sterile immortality, but when Boorman takes this idea to its logical extreme, you'll see beautiful care-free immortals begging Zed to shoot them, running into his bullets, falling bloody and blissfully dead in their lovely gardens, and you'll wonder if you really believe it.  Most other films, SF included, are about flattering our beliefs and preserving our illusions, not pushing them to their limits and showing us what they really imply.  As Boorman explicitly reminds us, by our personal and shared myths we practice our own form of Show Business.  But what if our show never ended?  (""We've been to the stars ... another dead end ..."" says one character, bored.)  US pop culture of the 1990s responded to prolonged prosperity, and it wasn't pretty, nor very different from Boorman's Vortex: sharpened competitiveness, social conformity and all-consuming gossip and nastiness that poisoned amity, politics, and sexual relationships, all from boredom; we treated the people and places around us like insufficiently stimulating entertainment.  This film is about one showman (the first character we see) who sneers at this charade of ""progress"" and rings down the curtain.  As drama, it's like Beckett on acid Kool-Aid being reconciled to the natural cycle.  Boorman satisfies our short attention span in the final montage, giving us Connery and Rampling in their cave, delivering a baby, who matures before our eyes and leaves them behind (Rampling reaches out, vainly, to keep him from going ...), and the parents age, wither, die, decay, and crumble, still holding hands.  The puns, visual and verbal; the showbiz references; the refusal to be solemn or earnest or adolescent in the face of Death or Sex; the Apathetics, bored to catatonia by everlasting life and incapable of feeling physical attack; the conquest of Hell, which is now an endless, boring cocktail party for creaking ancients; the re-scoring of Beethoven's Seventh for organ and two male altos; there's plenty to freshen your viewpoint on old things you haven't thought through in a while.  Not for those who ""just want to be entertained"", or who think that pop conventions of today will look like the Last Word on style and attitude in thirty years.",1021161600,10,3610,5.093220338983051
351193,5,6301744128,"If you like standard sci-fi movies, you're going to hate this.  If you are an avid sci-fi READER, this is one of the cinema's holy grails.  Boorman retells the story of the serpent giving man god's knowledge and destroying eden:  this time god is a community of eternally young intellectuals who took their advanced technology  and withdrew from a crumbling future world, the serpent is one of the immortals determined to redeem the barbaric survivors of the human race and jump-start poegress and evolution, and Adam is Sean Connery in a shocking red diaper costume.  What may have seemed dated a few years ago is now hip and fresh again, giving this film added punch.  Technologies for slowing and stopping aging are falling into place while we in the industrialized world are are widening the chasm between the haves and the have-nots.  The era of self-absorbed immortals living concealed, protective lives away from the savage outside seems more immediate now than when the film was made.  As for the flick itself; great music, weird/elliptical dialogue, mind-bending set design, naked hippies on horseback, a giant stone head that flies, and truly LSD inspired visual effects round out a wild and wonderful work.",1020038400,2,1217,5.019900497512438

This film is a perfect illustration of the famous Shakespeare line, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""
There are a lot of 'confusing' plot points and hallucinatory extremely obvious symbollism to make the film look deep, but when you get right down to it, the film mostly just makes some very cliched obvious statements. Excellent cinematography and gratuitous nudity notwithstanding, the film is surprisingly dull and lacks any sort of emotion or suspense to make it a worthwhile film to watch.",1014681600,10,671,5.1
351276,5,6301744128,"First off, the DVD is fantastic - the picture and sound quality are ace (it has a ghostly, ethereal look to it and there's a French dialogue track to make the film seem even artier, although unfortunately the voiceover artist doesn't attempt to imitate Connery's accent). There's a trailer and some photo galleries, but best of all is a commentary by director John Boorman, who seems to project a mixture of pride and embarrassment at the film ('You can skip this bit', he says at one point, and elsewhere he admits that the film may have had too many ideas and that some became lost in the mix).
And what a film. It's perhaps the epitome of the early-70s post-2001 'head' film, a conceptual sci-fi opus in which immortal survivors of a future cataclysm gather together in a forcefield-protected country mansion to seemingly participate in a telepathic version of 'The Weakest Link', only one in which everybody has to be nice to each other for fear of being artificially aged. Sean Connery is a mutant superhuman savage in a loincloth, there's a giant stone head, it's filmed in the countryside, all kinds of things are squashed together to form a film which doesn't make a great deal of sense but has a barmy power to it. The soundtrack has an excerpt of Beethoven's Seventh symphony and there are lots of naked women, and I'm sure that there's at least one early-70s folk/rock concept triple-album that draws its inspiration from the film.
Actually describing its appeal is very hard. Its easy to dismiss it for being tripe, or to go the other way and herald it as a masterpiece . John Boorman had a knack of creating films which lend themselves to endless analysis, and you could make comparisons between the elitist society in 'Zardoz' and the dot-com boom, all kinds of things.
This is very much a 'try before you buy' thing. Oh yes.",1014508800,2,1839,4.679012345679013
351277,5,6301744128,"When director John Boorman made ""Zardoz"" back in 1973/4, he
was hot off of the success of his classic thriller ""Deliverance"",
and pretty much allowed to do whatever he wanted.  The result
was this completely different sci-fi film ""Zardoz"", which took
place in the year 2293 and featured one of the most sophisticated
and complex plots of any sci-fi movie before or since.  The movie
was savaged upon its release as pretentious and hard to follow,
and is today looked back on by movie guides as a campy 70s oddity, simply because it features Sean Connery running around
in oversized red underwear.  However, even its harshest critics
are usually forced to admit that the film boasts an impressive visual style, which is indeed the case.
Written during the immediate post-psychedelic era, ""Zardoz"" was
a clear attempt to encapsulate the intellectual and spiritual
concerns of those acid-drenched times.  The themes and plot
twists are quite dense--so it is not completely suprising that
many people are bewildered by it--although anyone who takes the
time to understand will find it filled to the brim with interesting and very deep ideas that were completely alien to
sci-fi at the time, and still rarely discussed in any genre of film.  The plot concerns a future Earth where a group of
evolved immortals live a life of imposed isolation from the
rest of humanity, which has devolved into brutal anarchy and
violence.  One of the immortals, Arthur Frame, attempts to keep
the brutals in line by appearing occassionally in a large flying stone head and impersonating a god named Zardoz (taken from ""The Wizard Of Oz"").  However, one day one of the Brutals named Zed (Connery) sneaks into the head and finds himself taken to the Vortex, the home of the immortals. There he finds that although they are highly advanced, with a plethora of knowledge and psychic abilities, they have failed to solve the mystery of life and many have become either renegades (punished for psychic violence and aged to senility) or apathetics (a result of the boredom of immortality).  Zed is slowly educated by several of the immortals and comes to realize that he contains the key--the physical vitality and energy, embedded in the lower chakra centers--to liberating the immortals from their slow stagnation.  He eventually does so, but only after confronting his own preconceived notions of god and self, which involves killing all that he once was, just as he had murdered his previous god, Arthur Frame/Zardoz, at the beginning
of the film.  He then brings death back into the Vortex, which
is welcomed with open arms.
If this sounds confusing or perhaps too cerebral (some might
say pretentious) for you, then avoid ""Zardoz"".  However, even if
one doesn't understand a word of what is going on, the visuals
will entrance: the movie was filmed in the gorgeous hills of
northern England/Ireland, the costumes have a colorful post-
psychedelic look to them, and Boorman's virtuosic directorial
style contains several notable sequences that are still discussed
by fans of the movie (most notably, the sequence where Zed receives the immortal's knowledge and powers through osmosis).
All of this is very trippy, with sequences sped up, slowed down
or reflected through mirrors, put through filters and other
tricks.  And if some of what happens verges on over-the-top camp, what most critics curiously never understood was that
it was all intentional camp with touches of Monty Python-esque
humor, used to parody its own intellectual ambitions.
My favorite sequence is the one in which Zed figures out that
the crystal connects every immortal; it describes itself as
the equivalent of god with some brilliant dialogue which sounds
lifted out of a book on the Tao Of Physics.  Zed then realizes that although this god is more daunting than the one (Zardoz) that he had believed in as a brutal, he must still penetrate and kill it (similar to Zen quotes which state that one must,
paradoxically, ""kill the Buddha!"").  He then finds (in a very trippy and symbolic sequence involving mirrors) that he
is really killing himself, or his previous ego, and must reconstruct who he is and then restore the harmony between
physical vitality and psychic/intellectual might that had been disrupted by the immortals.  I cannot think of another movie
that has handled such occult spiritual topics with such wisdom,
humor or stylistic panache.  Boorman's commentary in the marvellously restored DVD version is also quite interesting, as
he explains how many of the special effects and directorial
tricks were achieved, and attempts to defend the film against
all of the criticisms that have been put on it over the years.
Connery delivers a magnetic performance, and overall ""Zardoz""
remains one of my favorite films, and one of the most overlooked, underrated and misunderstood movies ever.",1012780800,30,4855,5.057571964956195

It's bad. Really bad.  Really Really bad. The ideas, the execution, the acting, the writing, the directing, the editing, the lighting, the camera work, the sound, all exemplify why so much pre-Star Wars 70's science fiction is not worth watching.

351282,5,6301744128,"I'm going to mostly keep my review limited to what they've done with the DVD since if you dig back far enough you'll find my thoughts on the film (somewhere...)  Briefly though, Zardoz is really unlike no other film.  Its wonderfully muddled by an overly-think plot, and enough symbolism to ensure you'll never really get to the bottom of it.  I absolutely adore this film and have seen it at least a dozen times (I'm always showing it to someone.)
The DVD finally does justice to this film--justice not done by the VHS or laserdisc.  There is a considerable amount of material that was cut off the full-screen edition and even the LD was cropped.  Now we can finally see Sean Connery shoot John Boorman in the head, as well as the shot where Zed sticks his finger through a painting.  Visually this is SOOOO much better--the hazy effect which looked like tape degradation is now clearly the result of cinematic techniques which look awesome here.  The sound is good, but it was never really that bad, so no complaints there.  The director's commentary is a hoot if not super-informative, and you can (as a bonus) watch the film in French.  Ironically I think Zardoz may even work better in French (but its just THAT kind of film.)  There are a few other goodies, but nothing really notable.  What's more outstanding is just the quality job they've done in reproducing the original film on DVD.  If you are at all a fan of the film, you really do owe it to yourself to own this addition since this is the first time we've had a chance to see it the way it appeared in the theatre since its original theatrical release.
Lastly, to those who don't care for this film, the beauty of Zardoz that you're missing is how really deep it goes.  Sure, it needs to be laughed at--Boorman tried to do WAY to much, but I'll take that any day over the hoards of films which do way to little.  Zardoz actually does contain some greating acting and some poignant messages if you are patient with it.  Sure, it looks weird...it looked weird back then!  But films like this are a rare treat and the sort I enjoy tremendously, even if it isn't a -good- film in the conventional sense.  I think a phrase I've used to describe it before is an 'enduring disaster'.  Zardoz is definitely a mess, but it is a worthy mess--and so much more delightful on this DVD.",992217600,38,2338,4.474056603773585

351349,5,6301744128,"What can I say about this movie?  I had never heard of it before until one night my roommate and I were watching some documentary about science fiction on A&E (or some similar channel).  They were showing various movie clips and interviewing various SF authors, and then, out of nowhere, comes this clip of ZARDOZ:
A stone head floats into view amongst masked warriors on horseback, makes a scary speech about how guns are good and the penis is bad, then a plethora of guns gushes out of the stone head's mouth.
It blew my mind.
Needless to say, as soon as possible a pilgrimage to the video store commenced and ZARDOZ was attained and watched.  Twice.  Then again. And again.  It's a truly unique movie, after seeing it I really began to pay attention to John Boorman's other work (I've seen all of them, except for THE GENERAL and the current TAILOR OF PANAMA), this is a pretty good summation of 70's SF in general, with lots of winks to Heinlien in particular.
The only problem is that it's dated, very much a 70's tainted view of the future...so much so at times it's laughable (""You have been found guilty of psychic violence..."").  And Connery running around in a red diaper the whole time is most amusing. And ok, ok, it is rather pretentious at times.  But this cheesiness is half the fun.

Zardoz, released in the late 70's, is a coda for that great period of cinema sci-fi as pure social commentary, from Planet of the Apes in the late 60's and including Silent Running, Soylient Green, and Logan's Run.  That being said, I don't mean that Zardoz is necessarily successful in getting its point across.  What I really mean is that, much like Connery's trip in the big Zardoz head early on, the fun here is in the ride.

As a child of the 80's, I didn't appreciate the TV edited version my sci fi loving dad made me watch with him at the age of 12. 3 years later, my father ordered a real copy of Zardoz on VHS and the fun started.
What was initially a romp of bad acting and T&A became what i thought to be one of the unintentionally funniest movies ever made. It tries to make all these points about life, the curse of immortality and what could happen in a possible future, but the inherent campiness of the era this was filmed in makes the film miss it's point almost entirely. However, this flaw is actually the films' strength, in showing how this sitirical look on an alternate future makes for some ground breaking, shocking and downright hysterical entertainment.
Where else does a giant stone head give lectures about the penis being evil? Where else are you introduced to a movie by a guy's face with a badly painted on mustache floating around? Where esle is plastic wrap referred to as ""Indestructible"" and a defendant's plea includes the words ""I try to supress these thoughts, but they leak out in second level through the head wound of my 3rd death?""

351352,4,6301744128,"I will not rest until every person on earth has seen this film.  ""Zardoz"" is a work of staggering genius, from the twisted re-scoring of the Allegretto of Beethoven's 7th Symphony for organ and warbling female voice to the time-lapse finale: there truly has never been a film like this.  Possibly John Boorman's own ""Metal Machine Music,"" this was his first film after the successful ""Deliverance.""  Unlike Lou Reed's twisted creation, there is some actual content to this film, though you'll have to slog through several viewings just to grasp the basic structure of it.  Mr. Boorman suggested as much to critics, and was probably crucified for it.  While ""Zardoz"" has been relegated to cult-film status, and it is awfully hilarious at times, it's also oddly fascinating.
First off, it starts with the floating, slowly spiraling head of a man in a silly hat and penciled-on mustache mocking us, the audience.  Oh boy.  This will either pique the curiosity of the masochistic or scare off the less easily amused.  Trust me, you should stick with it.  Arthur Frayne's head gives way to the giant floating stone head ""Zardoz,"" from which the picture gets it's name.  Soon we are introduced to Sean Connery's Zed, an exterminator for Zardoz, who hunts down the Brutals as part of a population reduction program.  Zed realizes he's a pawn in someone else's game, however, and breaks his way into the society of immortals (the Eternals, who don't in any way resemble the immortals of Connery's ""Highlander"") via Zardoz, the only link between his world and theirs.  Hijinks ensue.
Other reviewers have given a pretty good idea of what you can expect.  Part of the difficulty in watching this film stems from a few 70's stylistic oddities- first, the metatextual opening segment.  Second, the weird sound effects and repeated images that at first confuse, and eventually become recognizable as Boorman's filmic representation of psychic powers.  Third, Charlotte Rampling's cool, scary eys.  These may be offputting to some viewers.  Fourth, Sean Connery running around in a red diaper, shooting anything that confuses him.  That's actually the beauty of this character, at first.  Then he becomes the traditional Matrix/Star Wars/Jesus-like savior figure.  Usually this annoys me but here it's entertaining.  Zed's progress from plaything of the Eternals to bringer of chaos is not exactly inspiring, but it is pretty satisfying.  Ultimately the most confusing part of this film (from my perspective) is Zed's final showdown with ""the Taberacle,"" a sort of HAL-like super-intelligent computer network represented as, variously, a disembodied voice, a house of mirrors, and a roundish crystal.
And thus we find the great value of purchasing this video: it is worth repeated veiwings.  Many, many viewings if at first you find the movie bizarre and intractable, and then increasingly compelling.  The biggest failing of the film is that despite it's rather modest 105 minute (or so) running time, it feels like about a two and a half hour long film.  I'm notorious for falling asleep during ""Zardoz"" after I've forced my poor friends to watch it.
The best thing, to me, is not the giant stone head intoning ""The gun is good!  The penis is evil!"" (though that's pretty great), nor is it the image of Sean Connery in a wedding dress (tough to beat), nor the coniving Friend's (John Alderton) refusal to go to second level (""Renegade!"") nor Friend talking backwards for the entertainment of his fellows, and it's not even the Eternals attempt to ""stimulate an erection"" in the hapless Zed- no, my favorite thing about this movie is that my father wanted to rent it once a long time ago when I was a kid.  Little did he know that he would spark a life-long obsession in his son.  I ask my dad today if he remembers seeing ""Zardoz"" and he looks at me blankly.  How this film could fail to make an impression on a person is a mystery to me, but I thank him anyway.  Make my obsession yours.  Buy ""Zardoz"" today.",980553600,7,3997,4.9120715350223545

- When the gulf between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" becomes extreme...
- When a commune is linked not by a common purpose, but instead telepathically...
- When social engineering is taken to its logical endpoint (in a manner similar to Brave New World)...
- When an artificial intelligence controls society (over 20 years before The Matrix)...
- When immortality becomes a very real possibility...

Zardoz was an immediate request for the list since one of our coworkers had found a picture from the movie online. Of course it was a photo of Sean Connery in his lovely red diaper outfit complete with bullets slung across his chest. The picture was goofy enough, we knew we had to see the movie.
The movie is weird from start to finish. Just plain weird. But it sticks with you. It has a sort of Alice in Wonderland meets B-Movie Sci-Fi feel to it (the floating Zardoz head was primo). The next day that was what we were talking about - Zardoz. The movie's dialogue and plot can be very hard to follow at times. Bafflement is a given with this film, although I'm sure if I watched it a couple more times it would all be clear to me.
There are some stunning visual 'effects' in this film. As a photographer, my favorite visual effect was projecting what I'm guessing were famous pieces of art onto people's bodies with a black background. Very visually interesting and some interesting messages if you can decipher them.
This is a very very artsy movie, not one for the fan of predictable plotlines.",978393600,8,1175,4.419354838709677
351395,4,6301744128,"It is interesting to note that a science fiction movie made by Sean Connery at the height of his popularity in the mid 1970s would be so little  known and played. Yet ""Zardoz"" is virtually unknown, and is regarded as a  cult film. This is an intriguing, well acted, and absorbing movie, albeit  uneven at points, and it is also one with quite a provocative premise at  its core. It depicts a futuristic world in which the rich and educated live  inside a protective bubble and the workers/barbarians live outside the  protective enclosure in the dangerously polluted elements, and must fend  for themselves.  It is a play on both the kind of insane prognostications  of H.G. Wells ""Time Machine"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" wrapped  into a single screenplay. Also quite interesting is the fact that it is now  can be used as a symbolic parable for our own times. Another reviewer has  the right idea when he says the enfeebled effete intellectuals hiding in  the enclosure would be comfortable selling IPOs to each other. Done before  the days of big-budget special effects, it is much like ""Fahrenheit 451"" in  requiring a little poetic license in its sets and depictions. Yet you will  find yourself rooting for the barbarians as the plot unfolds and the  parable works its way to the movie's conclusion. This isn't for everyone,  but it is an interesting, provocative, and thoughtful movie that I  recommend highly. Enjoy!",967507200,14,1435,4.855371900826446
351396,5,6301744128,"How little sense this movie made the first time I saw it: those goofy costumes, that strange plot! But for all the weirdness I could never forget it, it remained in a corner of my head. And then, the second time I had the  occasion to see Zardoz, everything fell into place: like HG WEll's Time  machine, Zardoz was a sci-fi interpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche's  philosophy.
THe plot in a few words: mankind is doomed because it is  crumbling under the burden of its own historical consciousness (remember  the ruined library in the beginning?), most of the men have been wiped out  by a world war-type catastrophe, their descendants have fallen back into  animality, struggling to survive in brutish conditions and revering the  Titan-like Zardoz. Meanwhile, literally preserved in a bubble are a happy  few last men, a bunch of superior spirits who have discovered the secret of  immortality, or so they believe, but the secret is quite awful: immortality  is sterility. Of course the immortals are playing a losing hand (Nietzsche  didn't like the Last Men, the ones who come after history's pendulum  movement has spent itself and come to a standstill). Apparently happy,  apparently dominating, the dwindling bunch of immortals feel like prisoners  in their pastoral bubble, and the only way out for them is the sweet  oblivion of senility. Now just a stylistic comment: the immortals are  dressed in 70s futuristic gear, the senile old farts don Edwardian formal  dress: the movie was not about some hypothetic future situation, it was  about the here and now of 1970s Britain; senile establishment, futile youth  with the illusion they will be forever young, and the starving third world  knocking at the gates of the bubble.
In Also sprachte Zarathustra,  Nietzsche tells us the saviour is an Ubermensch, a ""superman"" who  will shake off the sterility of the last men to push them back into the  meaningful and necessary movement of history, launching a new cycle where  others pretended there was only a single line, from beginning to end, with  progress in between (Hegelian/Christian view of History/Divine Providence).  Incidentally, a new cycle means both shedding (the illusion of) immortality  and recovering the capacity to (pro-)create. Hence the final scene of the  movie. It's interesting to see how, while the catastrophist vision of the  future has receded since the 1970s, the obsession of Western societies with  the illusion of eternal youth has only grown stronger...
I can't think  of another movie so ladden with deep and cryptic philosophical metaphors,  even more stunning as it is quite entertaining without possessing an MA in  phil.",960336000,27,2667,5.097222222222222
351397,5,6301744128,"Films can be great for many reasons.  For myself, one of the most powerful achievements of a great movie is the way it can combine music and image to create a special insight into what is usually an ineffable emotion.  In  'Zardoz', Boorman utilises the second movement of Beethoven's Seventh  Symphony as a theme.  In the film's finale, Ludwig van B's sweeping music  is combined with snapshots of the lives of the two protagonists, to create  a pin sharp insight into the ephemerality of our lives.",959472000,2,500,4.744186046511628
351398,5,6301744128,"I first saw this film back in the late 70's (I think) on late night television.  Twenty years later, I had forgotten the title, but I remembered a few things: it had naked women in it(I was 12 or so and the  station ran it unedited--bless them);  it had Sean Connery shooting just  about everything and running around in an orange diaper and wearing a  pigtail; and it was strange, strange, strange, and I liked that.
Twenty  years later, I grabbed a movie guide and searched for Sean Connery films.  ""Zardoz"" I found.  That had to be it.  I rented it and sat down  and watched it all over.  It was as wonderfully strange and goofy as I  remembered.  I loved the big floating head of the god Zardoz at the  beginning.  My wife hated it, and watched only 30 seconds of it.  If you  must have your movie spoon-fed to you, forget this one.  If you're brave  enough to be baffled at times, strong enough to see Sean Connery in a  wedding dress, and tough enough for some laughable dialog, then you've come  to the right movie.",957312000,99,1022,4.329787234042553
351399,3,6301744128,"Zardoz was made in 1974, and it shows its age.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Boorman's dystopian society is meant to represent the world as it would have become if the Flower Children of the 1960's had gotten  everything they wanted.  The Eternals, who are perpetually young and  beautiful, have walled themselves off from the problems of the world.  They  are all equal, free from unwanted labour, and fear (and wear) virtually  nothing.  The elderly are criminals because criminals are aged by their  society.  (Except for the few who were unlucky enough to already have been  old when the society was created.)  We are eventually shown, not too  subtly, that such a society is doomed to failure, supposedly because of the  inevitable boredom it produces.  In 1974 this message may have seemed fresh  after a decade of Peace and Love; today it seems somewhat less important.
This does not detract from the beauty of the film, which has aged almost  as well as the Eternals it depicts.  The cast is remarkably good; they  deliver the script with more earnestness and sincerity than it deserves.  Sure, there are occasional lapses into tediously hallucinogenic sequences,  which might have been less annoying in the ""heady"" atmosphere of its day  (although I rather doubt this).  And the ""surprise"" buried the film's title  is revealed to us by the filmic equivalent of a repeated and thorough  bludgeoning with a large blunt instrument.  (Speaking of Sean Connery, this  might be his only film in which he wears a wedding dress --  which may or  may not make you want to see it!)  But on balance, the film's merits  outweigh its shortcomings.  It's not deep, but the surface is lovely.",947721600,7,1695,4.8350877192982455
351400,4,6301744128,"As an impressionable college student, the idea that immortality could be undesireable was a big one to wrap my mind around.  Add to that the moving score, Beethoven's 7th Symphony, and you have a movie that will always be a  classic...at least in my mind!  Parts of it seems a bit silly, but who's to  say which of our ideas will turn out to be so.",945561600,3,348,4.2272727272727275
351401,4,6301744128,"A great many audiences are quick to judge a film based solely on its special effects.  Zardoz hasn't many to offer.  A great many audiences like to say they want a story told to them over the course of the film.  Zardoz  has a story, it's just not tailored to the audience as well as most popular  science-fiction.  A great many audiences will say that the performances of  actors is paramount to how much they enjoy a film.  Zardoz relishes in a  distant sort of melodrama where educated minds of the future speak slowly  and intensely (IE not naturalistically).  A great many audiences do not  care for this film.  It could be argued that such audiences are simply not  prepared to accept the Zardoz experience, but those who are will be  presently rewarded.  Sean Connery is cast in the role he's always been  perfect for: sex beast.  He is introduced to a culture that has rejected  the brutality of physical contact in favor of developing their minds.  And  so his challange, at least on one level, is presented.  If that's not  enough to spark interest in the film, perhaps the fact that he eventually  grows into his role as Liberator will.  It is a Luke Skywalker sort of  journey, only Luke doesn't wear a shirt and wears tiny underwear.  And he  speaks in a Scottish accent.  And his path isn't as neatly trimmed.  He  is surrounded by director John Boorman's strange world where a utopian  society have grown to hate their own immortality.  He is surrounded by  strange technologies that are usually a projection effect.  And, most  importantly to Mr. Connery, he is surrounded by scantly clad women who  aren't afraid to flaunt their arrogant belief that they are superior to  him.  And wouldn't Sean like a challange?  People will know if  they'll like the film as of the first five minutes.  So unconcentional and  unlike anything else in popular cinema is the opening, that the  Independence Day crowd and the Fellini crowd will be drawing lines in the  sand.  Listen to the words coming from the mouth of that disembodied head,  if the combonation of that visual and the words ""is god in show  business too?"" is not setting you up for what's in store, nothing can.  Boorman tries his best to prepare you... for some audiences, the  preperation is more than adequate.  But for most audiences, the words  ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" is all the  excitement they need... and about as far as they're willing to explore.",939945600,12,2449,4.64

7814447,3,6301744128,"Parts of this film of this film are good, but the film-makers, in my view, tried to put too much in the film. As a result, the film as a whole is virtually incomprehensible. What seems to me to be clear is that the film-makers wanted to disparage religion. The concept of God is mocked. God in the film is simply a head that flies about forcing people to work and bring him food so that he can give the food to the eternals. God is said in the film to be able to control people to do as he wants, a belief that many religious people have, but the god uses this power for his own benefit. The very name for the god in the film, zardoz, was chosen for irony, for as the film explains, it means he is a fake. People are promised life after death, but this is a lie.
There are people who because of their misuse of the laws of nature live forever, but their primary desire in their eternal life is not sex  they lost their sex drive, the penis is considered evil  it is oblivion, to die. They suffer for all eternity in boredom. It becomes clear that the human in the story, represented by Sean Connery, is better than the eternals. They are static. He has potential.
The eternals came into existence because scientists violated the laws of nature, and one of the messages of the film is not to be religious and obey god, but to obey the laws of nature.",1522800000,2,1349,4.164750957854406
