8323824,5,B00005JHCE,If you want the intimate detail of life in England in the early part of the 20th centuary this film will give you a true flavour of the variety and richness of the characters in life. Some wonderful and big hearted others sad and pathetic. but all rich in detail. The bonus of the actual voice of the author is heard and adds a wonderful sense of authenticity to the experience of his childhood. If you enjoy the intimacy of the film The Song Catcher then you will enjoy this. Enjoy.,1184976000,2,483,4.318681318681318
