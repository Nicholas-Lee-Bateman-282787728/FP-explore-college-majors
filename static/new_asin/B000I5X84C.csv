2653158,1,B000I5X84C,"This Movie is really the worst I have ever seen, I can not belive I brought this. There is no storyline and the Acting is terrible. It is not even homemovie quality.",1176076800,5,165,4.1875
2653159,1,B000I5X84C,"I picked this up while browsing in Blockbuster. I thought the storyline might be entertaining. Man, what a waste of time this was! The writing and acting was on the level of an elementary school play. The grainy, dark video quality looked like it was shot on a cheap handheld video camera. The dialog drops out (dead silence) in several places while the actor's lips are still moving. I could have overlooked the horrible production quality if the story and acting had been good. The movie abruptly ends with no resolution whatsoever. I think everyone involved with this movie was just trying to get money to finance their crack habit.",1175904000,6,635,4.781818181818182
2653160,1,B000I5X84C,"awful product in every way. this is one of the worst video's i have seen. the picture quality is poor, the storyline is poor, and it appears to have been videoed with a camecorder. several scenes are repeated. not a good buy.",1175299200,5,225,4.380952380952381

2653182,1,B000I5X84C,"This movie was horrible. I am so mad that I wasted my money. Its okay if you don't mind hearing the ""f-bomb"" and people calling women female dogs. Buying this movie was a big disappointment for me.",1369699200,,197,4.351351351351352
2653183,1,B000I5X84C,This was not the kind of movie that I would watch and would not recommend for Christians.  There is far too much profanity for the average person to use and I found the profanity offensive.  I stopped the movie after five minutes.,1366156800,,230,4.4523809523809526
2653184,1,B000I5X84C,THIS MOVIE WASN'T EVEN WORTH ME BUYING. I THINK IT WAS WACK AND THEY COULD HAVE DONE ALOT BETTER WITH THE ACTORS AND THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE.,1365811200,,139,4.0
2653185,3,B000I5X84C,The things we do for someone to spend some time with us. People have to do what they feel is best and not worry about what others think or say as long as they are happy.,1361232000,,169,3.7222222222222223
2653186,4,B000I5X84C,"This was a good movie, not so typical plot and story line.  I liked the movie, worth a watch, for sure",1359936000,,102,3.857142857142857
2653187,2,B000I5X84C,This movie was very slow and difficult to get into. The quality of the film was very cheap and the actors were not very skilled.,1359504000,,128,4.16
2653188,1,B000I5X84C,Poor quality. Must have been shot by back-yard unskilled friends who are obviously unemployed. A true waste of money. Don't buy,1358899200,,127,5.095238095238095
2653189,4,B000I5X84C,"Good story, story reminds me of several people I know. Good love story mixed up in a whole lotta drama. Alot of soap opera type drama and some funny parts as well.",1355875200,,163,4.125
2653190,3,B000I5X84C,It is entertaining and has some good spots.  Just a little over the top for me.  This is the type of movie you probably watch only a couple of times.,1355616000,,149,3.933333333333333
2653191,3,B000I5X84C,I like the movie but to much profanity.  If they would have found a another way around the profanity I could have given it 5 stars.  This is something that happens everyday in life and it was good to see it in a movie.,1354492800,,218,3.9318181818181817
2653192,2,B000I5X84C,"I will just say from now on if it is not a mainstream producer, diretory, etc. I will not watch.",1353283200,,96,3.85
2653193,5,B000I5X84C,"OMG! This movie was so good, It has an awesome storyline and it truely address some real life issues. It add a twist of comedy too while also delivering a subliminal message through all the mess going on. If you haven't seen it, you are totally missing a great opportunity to be entertained and educated. Must see, get it now. I have already watched it 3 times and each time its still good. Independent films have excellent actors too, and this one proves it!",1335657600,11,459,4.476190476190476
2653194,5,B000I5X84C,"THis movie is outcold! Raw characters, raw acting. Jonathan West is awesome in this. Alot of low budget films miss the mark, but the acting from Jonathan is on point!!! Good job a must see. Highly recommend.",1335571200,7,207,4.621621621621622
2653195,5,B000I5X84C,"I went to a couple of walmarts and this was SOLD OUT. I then went on [...] and it was SOLD OUT. I;m so glad I found it here. I feel as though this was a extremely great film. I love when we see independent films that are good. I believe that the entire cast did a great job.  The acting was amazing and they are definitly on the rise. I truly see today's unknowns are tomorrow's superstars. Shout out to everyone who was involved in this film.
Lovers And Friends GREAT FILM!!!!!",1335398400,8,478,4.139784946236559
2653196,1,B000I5X84C,that was the cheapest movie ever did you all see when they were driving like they were driving from wherever they were to las vegas but they were actually driving in a parking lot,1250899200,,179,4.294117647058823
2653197,1,B000I5X84C,"This is the worst movie that I have ever seen.  I wish I could get the 73 mins that I wasted watching this crap.  The storyline, acting, grammar, still shots of Vegas, everything about it was horrible.  Recommending this movie to anyone would be a cruel and unfair punishment.",1249257600,,276,4.591836734693878
2653198,1,B000I5X84C,"I rented this video from Blockbuster, luckily I used my monthly free rental on this peice of crap.  It really wasn't worth the free rental.  This movie was so bad that I kept watching it to see how bad it got.  I wanted to turn it off, but the worse it got, the more I laughed.  This has to be the worst movie I have ever saw in my life.  I don't think it gets any worse than this movie.  The quality was bad, it looked lke a home video, and the acting was terrble.  Whoever put together this movie need not to quit they're day job.",1199318400,,532,3.9158878504672896
2653199,1,B000I5X84C,"i read a book thinking this was it. now i know it was not. i ordered friends and lovers, with leon and it is very good.",1179014400,4,119,3.6153846153846154
8144024,1,B000I5X84C,This movie should not have been made.,1521158400,,37,4.428571428571429
8144025,1,B000I5X84C,I usually like movies that have bad acting in bed angles because the plots are really good. And this movie however started off good but technically doesn't have an ending that anyone would be satisfied with. The music seem like it was back in the early 1990s and just didn't do it for me. Do yourself a favor and watch it strictly to see the bad stuff about it but not for full entertainment,1519430400,,391,4.297297297297297
8144026,4,B000I5X84C,it was funny the storyline is that it doesn't matter how much you love someone you can be tempted by someone else you just need to make sure your really ready for marriage or even a serious relationship because you can lose that within a twinkle of and eye...,1511827200,,259,4.3061224489795915
8144027,2,B000I5X84C,"Desperately wanted to give this movie more.  A couple funny moments, but a lot of under/overacting. Plot should have been true to form.  No one would believe they were wealthy in that awful hotel.  Gave it two stars because the cheating couple were somewhat more believable.  Plot should have developed more around these two.",1510963200,,325,4.962962962962963
8144028,1,B000I5X84C,Worse than garbage !,1510185600,,20,4.25

8144030,1,B000I5X84C,The storyline was good but the acting and everything else....questionable.  Can't even rate it as a good D movie.,1505692800,,113,4.947368421052632
