Here is what's on the DVD:

 The DVD starts out with a Ray Mercer opening credits theme song that does not end until 3:38. Not a bad highlight reel, you get to see why ""Merciless"" has the reputation that he has.

At about 3:38 of the DVD is when the instruction for the slips/bobbing and weaving start, and at 9:30 into it is when it ends, and the segment for Dirty techniques to watch out for starts. THAT""S IT. Barely over 5 minutes of instruction for bobbing and weaving and slipping.

At about  9:30 till about 24:29 is the dirty tricks segment. The rest of the dvd is  just him on a stool  talking, rambling a lot, pretty much saying the same stuff over and over again for how to prepare for a fight. The total running time of the dvd itself is barely over an hour.

So why the one star? For $30, I expected a lot more running time, a lot more content on the slipping/bobbing and weaving aspect, different situations for bobbing and weaving, doing those things in simulation with a training partner throwing a combination at you.  I feel that  putting dirty tricks and pre fight camp on a dvd for defense was a bad idea and that those two things should've been put on a separate one. Either that or simply make the dvd longer.

A better series off the bat in terms of boxing is Don Familton's tapes. Some other resources  that I think are better than Ray Mercers stuff are expertboxing.com,mightyfighter.com and precisionstriking.ca.",1414195200,2,1512,4.474452554744525
