This is NOT on the ""Smashing Watermelons"" DVD collection so one needs to seek it out as VHS.
Fast-forward through the miserable musical number in the middle (""Don't kick my tires"" is the name of the
song if I remember right).
After watching a number of his specials over the years, I appreciate his observational comedy far more than the smacking up of various food and other items.  He has an intellectual output that transcends that kind of banal humor.  Sledge-a-matic was funny the first few times but enough already.",1413072000,,687,4.913793103448276

After seeing him in person 2 times now he is still one of the best comics out there.  I was in the crowd for Messing With Texas and his show that I saw here in Waco was over 3 hours long.  At his age not many comics would do a show like that I want to commend him on his insite and comedy.",1207612800,,398,3.5813953488372094
