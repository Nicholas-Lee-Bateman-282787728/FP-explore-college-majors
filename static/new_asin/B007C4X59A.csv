8514210,3,B007C4X59A,"I have read and heard so much accolades about Gayle Hatch. I was interested because he causes some young female lifters with National success.

The cover of the DVD is misleading because I was hoping that I would see Matt Bruce demonstrate the lifts, and instead it was a young athlete. Don't get me wrong, the young lifter executed well, but what if we are coaching intermediate to advanced lifters?

Overall the video is truly a fundamental video. No verbal technical cues, which would probably turn me off, but it was very simple, like he said!",1409961600,,547,4.6875
8514211,5,B007C4X59A,"The resistance exercises known as the Olympic Lifts: Clean and Jerk and Snatch, along with all their subsequent auxiliary lifts are some of the most beneficial resistance related motor skills a human being can engage.  The down side is that these motor skills are not easy to learn and require proper coaching to acquire correctly.

This DVD does exactly that.  From the venerable and former Olympic Coach, Gayle Hatch, the individual is afforded all the details one needs in order to learn proper technique when executing these lifts and their auxiliary functions.

This instructional video covers all the lifts, point by point, and lift by lift, beginning with the warmups, moving into the details of the clean, how to jerk properly, snatches and squats from racked positions.

A young novice lifter demonstrates many of the steps, showing proper application and what mistakes are and how corrected.  This is why I like and endorse this video so highly: the attention to correct and perfect form.  Coach Hatch emphases safety, warming up properly and then form, form, and form.  This process is imperative to maximize benefits of this kind of working out without injury.  Nothing can end your athletic career more quickly than lifting way too heavy using crappy form.  This is when and how so many training injuries occur when doing these movements--lousy form slinging about very heavy loads.  This is not an ego workout but a solid resistance workout designed to become powerfully explosive and strong.

I have been a fan of Championship Productions' instructional DVDS, mostly those addressing the two arenas of wrestling and resistance conditioning. The goal of this video was to teach the beginner how to engage these actions of Olympic Weightlifting correctly and competently.  The DVD delivers.

Great Job Championship Productions.",1355702400,2,1840,5.193220338983051
