8764511,3,B01H2OWNQU,"Jasper Mudd (Orson Ossman) is a train robber who made off with a real hefty amount. He is pursued by Federal Marshal Denton J Cartwright (Eric Roberts) who is billed as the star, but dies in the first scene and doesn't even appear in a flashback. Our protagonist becomes the killer/thief who is being followed by an unlikable special agent (Chris Voss). He does the Josh Brolin ""Labor Day"" thing for a spell, but then moves on.

The film has a few decent scenes while at the same time felt slow. While Jasper fights with a gun, the title ""The Gunfighter"" is misleading. IMDB has ""Five Grand"" as the title, the price on Mudd's head. The acting wasn't half bad. Characters seemed good. The action scenes just didn't make it.

Made up trivia: Jasper Mudd is the direct ancestor of Harcourt Fenton Mudd.

Guide: No swearing, sex. or nudity.  2 1/2 STARS",1474070400,5,849,4.565789473684211
