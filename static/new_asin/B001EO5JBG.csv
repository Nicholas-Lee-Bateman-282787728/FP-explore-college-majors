Turned out to be an old Cantonese movie set in Singapore in the 1940s. The first reel was copied to the end of the film, so you start in the middle. It's not the story of Singapore, but is instead a movie titled (in translation) ""Singapore Story"".

Don't buy it. There's nothing here, save some older location shots, some Cantonese practice, and one perspective into wartime social relations.",1240099200,5,557,4.731958762886598
