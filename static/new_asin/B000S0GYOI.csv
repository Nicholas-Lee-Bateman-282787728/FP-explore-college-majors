2877664,2,B000S0GYOI,"The premise is promising: an avuncular, crotchety-but-lovable hash slinger (Kenny Shopsin) is being squeezed out of his beloved kitchen by greedy New York landlords and developers. And Kenny's musings on how New York's soul is being devoured by real-estate moguls are indeed interesting. Unfortunately, he has much more to say about a lot of other things, very little of which makes much sense except to him. The movie ends up being the worst thing a documentary can be: uninteresting.

I've eaten at Shopsin's a couple of times, and there's nothing charming about it. The food's decent, but the family is boorish and rude, and not in some quaint, lovable way. Kenny Shopsin is repulsive. This film is a good example of how art can make reality look a million times more appetizing than it is.",1205798400,10,793,4.874074074074074
2877665,2,B000S0GYOI,"This film had the makings of something I could really like. I've been in food service since the day I started working (Dairy Queen to Blimpies to Oren's Daily Roast) so I know this scene even if I have never done the restaurant thing. Plus I like documentaries, I'm a sucker for the pontifications of people who think they are smart, and I like movies made with no budget. And yet I didn't like this one. Director Matt Mahurin follows Kenny Shopsin around his Greenwich Village eatery Shopsins as he fights with his landlord until he eventually gives up and moves down the street. Mostly though Mahurin relies upon Shopsin's need to be a real a-hole and give his opinion on every matter of his life to carry the film past the finish line. However, it turns out that just because Shopsin is bigger than life doesn't mean that his personality is. Not that he isn't amusing at times. Looking like Michael Moore's impression of an aging member of KISS his views on customer service are not in line with mainstream America. . .in fact he has no problem kicking you out for no reason at all. If you are a party of five, or not a regular customer, or just want a cup of coffee he will kick you to the curb and not even pretend to be nice about it. I would also have to agree with him when he calls his philosophy ""half-baked."" After roaming around his kitchen for a while hunting flies he remarks on how the whole experience is existential. Huh? He'll also go off about the ways in which he runs his kitchen and views the world and none of it really makes any sense. Mercifully at the very end he makes a decent point, saying that outgrowing your expectation that you are a good person is healthy and productive because in reality you aren't. And to try and maintain the mirage that you are a nice person only serves to make your life more difficult.

My feelings on Shopsin were fairly mixed by the time the film had ended. On one hand there are my ideas about society, about how New York sells out more and more every year. And how these greedy landlords (like the one in this film) perpetrate that problem by squeezing out little guys like Shopsin. Poor Kenny is stuck working night and day just to stay afloat, meanwhile Outback Steakhouse has millions of excess dollars that they can pour into the Bush campaign. So yes, in that respect he is a good guy fighting the good fight. On the other hand, there is probably no excuse for him treating people the way he does. Yes, I know he knows that he is a bad person, but constantly berating his employees who are clearly working hard for him is a major turn off. I appreciate the straight talk but the way he goes for the jug on the totally unsuspecting is, in my book, out of line. The film itself is a snooze I'm afraid and feels every bit as amateurish as it is. The cinematography is no more advanced than point and click. We also get real tacky visuals such as the cameraman holding up a tiny mic so that Shopsin can blabber his way into Lala Land. Even worse is when we move away from his rants. As it is watching a fat guy shop for vegetables is not cinematic magic. . .it's not even ironic. And the scenes in which we watch them move from one location to the next just reminded me of every endlessly monotonous chore I've ever done and it turned the film into a real downer. I suppose the film could be a hit for those of you who like trashy reality TV where we lavish attention upon someone simply because they are eccentric and/or mean. To me this film was a massive miss. **1/4",1188777600,10,3532,4.327300150829562
2877666,3,B000S0GYOI,"This interesting documentary about a very interesting man (and hole-in-the-wall eatery) would have been way more palatable if it wasn't so difficult to watch.  It seems to have been shot in 24-P and subsequently lost every third frame of video; the resulting kaleidoscopic journey leaves one sea-sick from the unnatural camera movement.  Unfortunate, because this could have been a very intriguing documentary.  Alas, it is only worth viewing if you think you can stomach the video ""trip"".",1186185600,6,489,5.324675324675325
2877667,5,B000S0GYOI,"This odd documentary is a character study of a genuine New York ""character,"" namely cook and crackerjack philosopher Kenny Shopsin. It is claustrophobically shot, periodically unintelligible, and sometimes verges on the slightly creepy.

I quite liked it.

I've never eaten at Shopsin's, but after reading Calvin Trillin's brilliant portrayal of the hole-in-the-wall eatery in the New Yorker, I was hooked. The makers of I LIKE KILLING FLIES seem to assume that the viewer has dined at the establishment AND read that piece... and yet, for those of you who have done neither, this fascinating movie will immerse you in such close quarters with the sometimes coarse, sometimes brilliant Shopsin, it won't matter. You'll get the idea. The menus feature hundreds of outrageously hybridized dishes, no parties larger than four may enter, and whatever you do, don't antagonize the cook.

Highly Recommended: Calvin Trillin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feeding-a-Yen/dp/0375759964/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feeding a Yen</a>, which includes an expanded version of the aforementioned New Yorker essay.",1182470400,13,1143,6.176100628930818

2877701,5,B000S0GYOI,"I Like Killing Flies is a very interesting and entertaining documentary about Kenny Shopsin who runs a small restaurant with his wife Eve in New York City's Greenwich Village. Kenny comes across as very human although I must warn potential viewers that he swears quite a bit; this is not a ""family film."" Nevertheless, the film moves along well and my eyes were glued to the screen! In this case the hand-held camera's jerky moves didn't really help all that much; but what we see is so fascinating that this becomes a minor quibble. This is a fine ""slice of mom-and-pop owned small restaurant life"" with people (especially Kenny, the owner) marching to the beat of their own drummer.

Kenny Shopsin is quite a philosophical character--he has some pretty quirky rules even for his customers; he says that new customers ""must prove to him"" that they are worthy of being served in his establishment! Not that his restaurant is all that beautiful--that greasy, grimy kitchen is nothing special and the space Kenny and his wife Eve rent is not that large or special, either. But newcomers are attracted to Shopsin's because, as they say in the film, the place really begins to feel like ""home"" after just a few meals there with Kenny dispensing tough love along with his own brand of advice about life. Kenny's statements about morality are interesting, too.

During the film we see Kenny buy groceries for the restaurant, talk with customers (but don't be a party of more than four--he'll kick you out even if the place is empty except for you) and open the restaurant where he cooks everything to order along with his right hand man Jose. Kenny's wife is a waitress and Kenny's children help wait tables and they even cook from time to time. I also marveled at the innumerable ways to make pancakes that looked mouth-watering every time!

Kenny's problems begin to mount when he has to move and find affordable space; and the Shopsin family is faced with another sad loss along the way. However, I will avoid telling you too much more because I don't want to give out too many spoilers--I've already left out some of what you'll see so you can watch this film and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did!

I highly recommend this film for people who like strong, memorable and quirky documentaries with social and cultural themes thrown in for a good effect.",1356307200,,2352,4.701456310679611
2877702,5,B000S0GYOI,Why or how someone would think to do a documentary on Shospin I'm not sure but I'm sure glad they did.  He is a character unto himself.  He lives his life by his own principles and succeeds on many accounts. He is very candid and forthcoming.  He's a master chef on the  diner level. His creations and love of cooking are noteworthy. I would love to experience the whole dining experience and meet him in person. Follow his rules or get out of his diner.  No sucker for a buck.,1340236800,,477,4.2555555555555555
2877703,5,B000S0GYOI,"Though the cover art makes it appear decidedly Cronenbergian, I Like Killing Flies is a surprisingly intimate portrait of a fat Jewish chef whose philosophical ramblings are nearly as intriguing as his near-constant barrage of haranguing, fly-swatting and general ill-will...especially to 'parties of 5' or more. Kenny Shopsin, the film's nerve-splittingly hilarious protagonist, spends the bulk of his screen time meandering through the historical corridors of his restaurant, preparing amazing dishes on a stove that looks as though it may have been favored exclusively by a medieval alchemist. Shopsin's, Kenny's ancestral dwelling, is, as one savvy customers deems it, the inside of a tree with increasingly dense memorabilia gathering on the walls like internal rings. Shopsin's, as you'll learn if you watch this impeccably-edited film (even if handheld microphones jutting helplessly into frame distract at times), is a collection of curmudgeon Kenny's absurdities, his humors, his attempts to live a helpful and productive life, regardless of the acknowledgement that he is a self-admitted ""piece of s***."" You'll likely snicker over his interactions with his pot-smoking son or salivate as he prepares a number of catastrophically pretty dishes that would not look out of place in an internet food porn site. Kenny prepares everything by hand, painstakingly. The menu contains hundreds of items yet is cluttered much in the same ways as Shopsin's is cluttered when you first see it. Despite appearing almost irredeemably scattershot, everything inevitably has a place. Even if that means a bit of tinkering and a healthy dose a bit of profanity. I Like Killing Flies is unflinching and raw, though ultimately very pleasurable, a lot more pleasurable than one might imagine given the premise, the protagonist and the cramped, untidy environs. It would not seem an absurd notion to imagine many well-to-do film goers making a specific stop in their next NYC itinerary to stop at Shopsin's, if only to enter in the domain of such a colorful, irascible and down-to-earth loon as Kenny Shopsin, who can make a banana split with meat and cole slaw sound like the most appetizing thing of the last thirty years.

This is a wonderful film which accurately portrays a slice of New York City life which tourists rarely have a chance to experience.  To survive in The City you need to be a special breed otherwise you'll either be ignored or swallowed whole.

2877719,4,B000S0GYOI,"I found this slice-of-life documentary thoroughly engrossing, but some viewers may find it claustrophobia-inducing. It's not just that chef Kenny Shopsin's restaurant in New York City's Greenwich Village is a ratty hole in the wall, or that his tiny kitchen is a grim, grimy room, or that director Matt Mahurin is a poor digital cameraman, producing herky-jerky images and muffled sound. The problem is primarily this: we get up close and personal with a fat, sweaty, foulmouthed, cantankerous cook and his warts-and-all family, which is probably more intimate than most people would care to be. Yet it's precisely this intense intimacy and complete candor that make the film compelling.

From 2002 to 2003, Mahurin followed Shopsin in his final year at the location he ran for over 30 years. In the first half of the film, we watch him open his eatery for the day, talking nearly non-stop about his tools, menu, employees, and guiding principles. We meet regulars and old friends who eat some of the 900 eclectic, oddly named dishes he cooks, and we can't help but notice that patronizing the place requires nearly as much chutzpah and almost as thick a skin as Kenny has: woe betide rule-breakers like the party of five or the customer who just wants a coffee! Shopsin treats all those who get on his nerves to a fresh serving of hot temper or, at the very least, an affectionate phrase beginning with the letter F.

Shopsin is constantly breaking into rather disjointed reveries on what he calls his ""half-baked philosophy."" These irascible harangues are simultaneously misanthropic and amusing, both cynical and laughable, particularly one late in the film in which he expounds upon the importance of humility. He doesn't use that word, however; rather, he expresses his belief that virtually everyone is a selfish piece of excrement (and of course he doesn't use that precise word, either). When our protagonist's longsuffering wife Eve and their children weigh in on what it's like to work for a man who's both a genius and a jerk, the viewer is forced to sympathize.

In the film's second half, Shopsin loses his lease and decides to move his establishment to a larger location in the nearby Lower East Side. Family, friends, and customers all pitch in to make it happen. Everything must go, from hundreds of knick-knacks and supplies to an antediluvian stove that amazes us by failing to explode and incinerate either the old or the new restaurant. The reopening is a resounding success. We return for an epilogue the following year to learn that Shopsin's wife has died but that he hasn't changed a bit. The customer is still always wrong and the cook is always right, even when he's blurting out the most inappropriate things imaginable.

""I Like Killing Flies"" is a classic piece of Americana and an enduring contribution to the tradition of quirky, abrasive New Yorkers who make their city one of the most interesting on earth.",1247184000,8,2939,4.919354838709677
2877720,1,B000S0GYOI,"I Like Killing Flies (Matt Mahurin, 2006)

It is very, very rare that I stop watching a movie in the middle, never to return to it again. I've done it no more than a handful of times in over thirty years of movie-watching. There's a somewhat greater number I've wanted to stop watching, but didn't. None of those films, in either category, has been a documentary. Until now. I Like Killing Flies is without a doubt the single worst documentary I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. It makes What the [censored for Amazon consumption] Do We Know? seem like the world's most watchable movie in comparison. There are bad movies, there are awful movies, and then there is I Like Killing Flies.

A documentary about an annoying subject can still be watchable, and even enjoyable, if the director knows what he's doing. (cf. Mr. Death or Mule Skinner Blues for very good examples.) But music video director Mahurin (Bush's ""Everything Zen"", R.E.M.'s ""Orange Crush""), seemingly considering himself the next Errol Morris, has not clue one about how to direct long-form, and especially not documentary. He takes the tack of simply trailing the subject of his documentary, Shopsin's co-owner Kenny Shopsin, around and recording the absolutely idiotic things the guy says. Which is absolutely a valid way to make a documentary (again, cf. Morris), but when you do that sort of thing, whether the work is effective or not is all in the editing. Mahurin, like his subject, just doesn't know when to quit, or in this case when to trim, and so we're subjected to five-minute spiels by Shopsin about everything from the reasons his restaurant should be shut down by the health department (or the cops--you won't believe the ways he's jury-rigged his stove) to New York City politics. Which might even be all well and good if there was any sense whatsoever that Mahurin considered his subject pathetic, idiotic, or otherwise worthy of ridicule. When Morris does this sort of thing, you can tell by the way his subjects' words are presented that you're supposed to laugh at them, not with them. (If you haven't seen Gates of Heaven, by all means, do so now. I'll wait.) I get no sense of anything but hero-worship here. Of course, I could be wrong, but if I am, it's because Mahurin hasn't gotten that across. The people in this movie who aren't Shopsin and are critical of him come off as having an unreasonable grudge (usually for getting thrown out of the restaurant for not adhering to one of Shopsin's asinine rules), while his supporters, who are much more heavily represented, are overflowing with praise.

Awful, awful, awful. (zero)",1242950400,4,2632,4.81858407079646
2877721,5,B000S0GYOI,"This is like hanging out with Kenny Shopsin for 90 minutes. If you find his personality and cooking style fun and engaging (as I do) you'll love it. If he gets on your nerves, you'll hate it. I found the raw, jumpy, intimate style a great match for Shopsin's own. I think a lot of bad reviews are due to a mismatch between people who think they're going to watch some kind of culinary savant when Shopsin's existence is mostly about family, love, life, and one neurotic's search for wholeness.",1241481600,,493,4.488888888888889
2877722,4,B000S0GYOI,"""I Like Killing Flies"" chronicles life behind the scenes at Shopsins, a small but popular restaurant that was, at the time, in Greenwich Village.  Shopsins is the kind of place that attracts many long-time customers, and the eccentric proprietor, Kenny Shopsin, takes delight in fraternizing with his loyal customers.  He also is a rather crabby guy who has numerous rules his customers have to follow; for example, he won't serve parties of five or larger and everyone has to order a meal.  If someone breaks the rules, then he may just throw them out of the restaurant.  His extraordinary menu, which is cooked almost exclusively by Kenny and one other cook, contains hundreds of different dishes (the menu is available online and is worth a peek).  Inevitably, Kenny will invite comparisons to NYC's infamous ""Soup Nazi,"" but he's also certainly his own breed of semi-kook.

The documentary features interviews with this quirky man, his family, and many customers.  Whether or not you enjoy the film will be largely dependent on your reaction to Kenny, as the food gets rather short shrift here.  His musings are often funny, sometimes ridiculous, and occasionally insightful.  Unfortunately, the documentary has a horrible title and equally horrific DVD cover, which made me pass up watching it numerous times.  Fortunately, killing flies is a mentioned only a few times, and Kenny doesn't really seem to take any particular delight in the activity.  He's just trying to keep his restaurant sanitary after all.

The title is just one pearl of wisdom Kenny Shopsin shares with many to follow.
Introducing us to one of the specific entanglements charateristic of his kitchen, of which only he and his family would know how to navigate, he'll say ""If you don't do what you're supposed to, you'll get punished...RIGHT AWAY! And then, you must pay penance.""
I now would like to quote Kenny again. The following is taken from the final scene of the film. I thought it was so thought provoking I could not resist repeating it here so here goes:
""This is like another one of my half-baked philosphies. The FIRST duty of everybody, in life, is to realize that they're a piece of s---. They're selfish, they're self-centered...they're not very good, and, that you're willing to sacrifice 20,000 people in another country just so that you can, uh, go to uh, a WINGS concert. You've sacrificed the lives of a hundred thousand Chinese  uh female babies, just so you can rent this f------ camera (he's looking directly at director Matt Mahurin here) and do your stupid art project.  NO PROBLEM!  You're a piece of  [...].  Once you REALIZE you're a piece of [...] , it's NOT so hard to take. Because THEN...you don't have this FEELING that uh, you're a good person all the time. And, let me tell ya somethin'...feeling that you're a good person all the time is like having a brand new car with no scratches on it. It's a REAL responsibility which is almost impossible to live up to.  Being a piece of [...] and then occasionally doing something that's good and true...it's a much easier place to be. I think that's really important and I always try and raise my kids to understand that they're NOT that terrific. And that NOT being that terrific, that's okay  'cos most people who say they are terrific (pause) Bill Clinton..Cardinal Egan (pause) anybody that you wanna talk about..they're not so terrific---MARTHA STEWART!  They're not so [...] terrific either and there's nothing wrong with bein' not so terrific, ya know, in FACT it's what's the whole ball game is about, is about not being so terrific and accepting it.""
