7858561,2,6303993664,"Pros:
1) It's great to see Wesley finally gone. (ABOUT TIME!)
2) There are some nice moments between him and Picard.
Cons:
1) Cliche after cliche
2) Why is that fountain in a cave and guarded by a forcefield? Don't even ask . . .
If you liked Wesley, I imagine you'll like this episode where the Boy Wonder saves the day yet again. If you didn't like him, I tend to doubt you'll find much to like here, either. But whatever your opinion of Wesley Crusher, surely the writers could have come up with something better than this?",1031529600,,526,4.3232323232323235
7858562,3,6303993664,"Woo-hoo! Yes! He's finally gone! Wussley- whoops, Wesley- is finally off the show as a regular cast member! No more of that sniveling, goody-two-shoes attitude to nauseate the NextGen trekkies! Well, except for the once-a-season guest shot, but I can handle a small bit of Wesley every once in a blue moon.
Unfortunately, the screenwriters for this show decided to send off sci-fi's most-reviled teen by once again having him single-handedly save the day (and Capt. Morehead- whoops, Picard)! Man, do those guys know how to beat a concept to death or what! I'll take the umpeenth 'Holodcek malfunction' eppie over one of Wes' solo rescue shows any day of the week!
Yep, it sure is great to see the kid finally gone after this show. Now Jean-Luc can hit on Dr. Crusher and not feel so guilty about it! Go get 'er, chrome-dome! Oh yeah!
'Late!",1005955200,6,841,4.727891156462585
7858563,3,6303993664,"Wesley Crusher, Capt. Picard and a captain crash land on a mysterious planet, which is mostly a desert.  However, the craft they crashed in is damaged beyond repair, and the team begins a long march to distant  mountains in search of shelter and water from the blazing sun.  However,  when they enter a cave, the water supply in the cave is protected by a  force field, but the obsessive member attempts to disable the force field,  which causes rocks falling down on the away team, and seriously wounding  Picard.  Wesley must get to the water soon, or Picard will die.",962150400,3,570,4.63
