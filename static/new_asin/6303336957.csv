I loved the guy that played GB's father--complete old soldier to the end--and the antagonistic understanding between the two leads-Michael Pare and GB was great war time like comaradarie--they understood each other, even if the mission wasn't clear, and not knowing who to trust or talk to. I enjoyed it, and too bad about the narrow minded review from the guy who didn't know what he was getting---he was right about one thing--HE didN'T get it!  I liked it.",1104364800,,601,4.555555555555555
8448290,3,6303336957,"Being a Michael Pare fan, I beg to differ with the incredibly bad review given this movie. I thought it was an exceptional vehicle for Michael Pare's tough guy image. He's silent, moody, he gets the job done. He's a man on a mission and in conflict with himself because a new wife doesn't understand his willingness to go at any moment. The ending though, leaves you hanging on what the outcome of the 'winners' will be.",980553600,,420,4.467532467532467

HE'S A GREAT ACTOR, BUT HE DOES HAVE SOME SERIOUSLY BAD MOVIES.  THANKS, GUYS.  IF ANYONE OUT THERE CAN SEND ME THEIR OPINION ON ANY OF HIS MOVIES, PLEASE, PLEASE DO SO.  BAN@SONNENSCHEIN.COM.
