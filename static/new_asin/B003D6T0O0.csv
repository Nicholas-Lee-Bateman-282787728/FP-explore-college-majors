4111479,5,B003D6T0O0,"Great DVD, a must for anyone showing a dog in competetive obedience.
Michael Ellis is so in tune with dogs and how they think and what makes
them tick. I know he trains Schutzhund and Ring Sport but his methods
work for any type of heeling training you want to give a dog. I have
pointing breeds and his methods work well for them to build drive
and have them have fun when being trained.",1320364800,6,388,4.1866666666666665
4111480,5,B003D6T0O0,Michael Ellis is the guru of working dog training.  This is one of a series of videos that are must owns for anybody serious on learning reward based training.,1295308800,3,159,4.482758620689655

8394683,5,B003D6T0O0,Awesome!! Michael Ellis is the best trainer ever,1427414400,,48,5.125

8394685,3,B003D6T0O0,"Michael Ellis' information is some of the best, uses lots of real life examples and most of the time the videos are thorough. In this case there is missing information or not enough information (tuck stick and how to get a tuck SIT). This video suffers from not enough intentionality and relies too heavily on class footage. The audio during the last 1/3 is poor and the out takes are unnecessary. That being said I still picked up enough new pointers to make it worth it but wish Leerburg would make a more professional product. Despite low production value Ellis is great.",1394928000,3,574,4.637254901960785
8394686,3,B003D6T0O0,Camera man needs to learn how to work the camera if Leerberg  expects to charge $65 for their videos.  Bad angles where you can't see what is actually being shown. Looks like the camera man is sitting on the floor while Ellis is talking & the huge lights on the ceiling are right next to his head causing a blur & it's annoying to watch. Other shots the camera is all over the place or the subjects backs are to the camera making it difficult to see what's going on. I've purchased 3 videos from Leerberg so far & most likely will look for them used as I think $65 is to high for the quality being offered.,1378425600,4,606,4.127118644067797
8394687,4,B003D6T0O0,I bought this directly from leerburg and for the most part thought it was a very good tool for teaching heeling. My disappointment is not with the info presented but the quality of the DVD. Some segments were shown twice but in different chapters and the audio in segments was very poor. Overall still worth watching.,1360454400,,317,4.678571428571429
8394688,5,B003D6T0O0,The info and approach delivered on this dvd is by far the best info available. Outside of hiring an actual professional trainer this is the best info! It works plain and simple.,1358467200,,177,4.5625
8394689,5,B003D6T0O0,"Great video on how to get a professional heel. Minimal props needed - a wall, treats, and a target to stand on. Discusses motivation and how to get your dog to want to work - and when/why to stop them if they're done for that training session.

Nicely done, and I most especially love that they included footage of non-trainers in there making mistakes! (Or perhaps they were dog trainers learning a new method of teaching the heel.) Very helpful to anyone not a dog trainer by trade, and a nice alternative way to teach the heel.

While anyone could probably learn from this video, it is probably geared towards people that have some experience training with their dogs already, or at least read up a bit first. I wouldn't hand this to a complete novice, but it is not a hard method to grasp, either.

Mr. Ellis can move closer to me anytime...would love to attend his school for dog trainers! LOL!",1332633600,6,899,4.5030674846625764
