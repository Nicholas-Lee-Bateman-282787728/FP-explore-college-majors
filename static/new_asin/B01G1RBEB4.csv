7753233,2,B01G1RBEB4,Expecting a good old fashion Action movie from Oliver and director. Not good at all. Story was ok but lack of action took over and got boring after short time. Expected more.,1471392000,2,174,4.46875

7753235,1,B01G1RBEB4,"I was excited to see a big cast of 80s B actors in one film but totally disappointed with the horrible unsteady camera work that ruined the fight scenes, lousy story, and terrible editing,  NOT what I would expect from an Art Camacho movie. Don't waste your time.",1470441600,,263,4.479166666666667
7753236,3,B01G1RBEB4,"Ronus Steele (Olivier Gruner) is a paid assassin who gets his ""hits"" sent to him on his tablet. Apparently there is enough people who need killing in one town to keep him busy as he has to take on a ""psycho"" apprentice (Steven Dell) who has a girlfriend (Nina Bergman) turned on by killing. Ronus uses chemicals to kill his victims (I liked the working title ""The Chemist"" better) but there is also a lot of hand to hand fighting as well as a cat fight.

Ronus has little personality unlike his apprentice Blaine. The plot takes a twist, not too complicated, even Seagal fans should be able to follow it. Nothing overly special. Decent soundtrack and fight sequences.

Swearing, sex, and nudity (Nina Bergman)",1469923200,,709,4.664

7753239,1,B01G1RBEB4,"Really low budget.  Not well acted and poorly scripted.  There is a love story in there somewhere, but it is lost in non-sensical dialog and characters whose, well characters, change in the middle of a dialog....",1474502400,,212,4.861111111111111

7753243,3,B01G1RBEB4,Good combat sequences. However a very disjointed and confusing plot.,1472774400,,68,5.9
7753244,1,B01G1RBEB4,"Superficial characters, horrible overacting, soap opera stares into the camera, overuse of a smoke machine, editing and slow-mo like a bad heavy metal video, terrible simplified storytelling using dialogue instead of action, so many holes in the plot to count and finally too many weak action scenes like a bad WWE show. Painful to endure watching the whole thing. How do movies like this get made? What a waste of money!! They should have used the money to invest in acting classes and a screenwriting workshop...or two.",1472601600,2,521,5.0
