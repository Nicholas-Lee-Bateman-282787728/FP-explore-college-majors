1648880,5,B00005QTAS,"In 1964 Gene Roddenberry pitched his Star Trek idea to NBC executives as ""Wagon Train to the Stars.""  Expecting a western set in space, they gave Roddenberry the go-ahead and set him to work.  When they viewed The Cage in early 1965, they must have been surprised.  After complaining it was ""too cerebral,"" the suits issued a litany of other complaints:  the female second in command (Number One) was unacceptable, and there were too many females in general on the ship (""people will think there's a lot of fooling around going on up there"");  the presence of minorities would offend NBC affiliates in the South, who would refuse to air the program; and ""that guy with the ears"" had to go.  Roddenberry was willing to concede the female second in command, but thereafter he dug in his heels: minorities and aliens continue to be a presence in Star Trek to this day.
Watching The Cage from a 21st Century perspective, one wonders what the NBC suits were in a ringer about.  The episode is not appreciably higher in concept than many original series episodes, and the whole affair has an appealing ""New Frontier"" Kennedy-esque flavor.
Somewhat like an Ed Wood movie, Turnabout Intruder is unintentionally humorous.  The story idea is ludicrous, the dialogue cringeworthy, and the acting has to be seen to be believed.  William Shatner's realization of Kirk's body under the control of Janice Lester (which includes filing his nails and walking with a mincing gait) is the single most over the top performance in all of Trek.  He comes across as Joan Crawford on Psilocybin.  How his intensely homoerotic moments with guest actor Harry Landers got past the network censors will forever remain a mystery.  This story is the greatest camp masterpiece since Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?.
How does this DVD look?  The full color version of The Cage is a true restoration, not merely a remastering.  The print has been carefully cleaned and color corrected, and various sound elements (dialogue, music, and sound effects) have been remixed from the original sources.  Generally it wears its age well, although portions of the dialogue sound fuzzy.  The Black & White/Color amalgamation of The Cage is also included.  This version has had no rework done, which makes the restoration of the all-color version all the more stunning.  Gene Roddenberry's introduction from 1986 is also included, a nice touch.",1008547200,75,2399,4.969924812030075
1648881,4,B00005QTAS,"As a final treat for the Trekkies, we see Shatner display Kirk's feminine side in the series swan song, 'Turnabout Intruder', as an old flame takes revenge-- and control of the Enterprise-- by trading bodies with our esteemed starship skipper! Granted, it's sortuva psycho 'Fatal Attraction'-style feminine side, but at least he finally got a role with some real acting range... heh. Sadly, Uhura's absent from the final go-round, and Nurse Chapel has suddenly become a brunette (which I believe is Majel Barrett's natural hair color)! Fortunately, Spock is as logical as ever in this not-half-bad third season eppie. True, it still has a certain degree of hokiness & cheese that makes Star Trek's final year so memorable, but I think it holds up fairly well. It's definitely worth a watch!
Then there's most-anticipated eppie on this platter: the original pilot that didn't quite make the cut. 'The Cage' features a crew of completely-different folks, save for a certain pointy-eared individual. In this adventure, retro-Spock displays a small bit of emotion-he cracks a smile when he touches some vibrating plants, and shouts in surprise when the Talosians steal the women away from the stranded landing party. Nimoy's Boston accent also pokes through on occasion-- listen for his pronunciation of ""can't"" at the beginning right after the opening credits. This little linguistic characteristic would pop up from time to time in the first season, but eventually waned as the series went on.
Both the black-and-white and full-color versions of 'The Cage' are available here. Although the full-color show is the one I prefer to view, the B/W eppie includes an intro by Gene Roddenberry. I found his anecdotes regarding his early struggles with the networks regarding the pilot to be amusing and informative. His spoken memories kinda reminded me of grampa tellin' the young'uns stories of the good ol' days. It's also interesting to see what 'Star Trek' might have been like had NBC given the series a green light with the first pilot. Oh, the unrealized possibilities...

1648882,5,B00005QTAS,"With the release of Volume 40, the complete series of Star Trek: the Classic series is now on DVD.  The editorial above is in error however.  The copy of ""The Cage"" referred to as Episode 1 is the half and half copy which when released on tape originally was introduced by Gene Roddenberry.  The one called episode 99 is the completely coolorized copy which was first shown to tv audiences (the first ever tv showing may I add) in the middle of a Star Trek documentary that aired in between the first 2 seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation (which will probably start coming out on DVD next month). It continues to be the only copy of ""The Cage"" aired in syndication nowadays.  It was also released on videotape after the whole series was released on tape henceforth the number ""99"" (there were only 79 episodes counting ""The Menagerie"" as 2 but since Paramount counts it as 1, there are 79 with ""The Cage"").  With all of Classic Trek on DVD now after slowly coming out for 3 years, and all 9 movies available on DVD (as of November) again after slowly coming out for 3 years, we can look forward to the 10th movie on the big screen soon, and it's DVD months later as well as DVD releases of the sequel series (plural) Star Treks: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.  Of course if Paramount releases them as slowly as they did the above mentioned 49 discs and the 3 box sets of the movies, it is safe to say it will be at least 10 years for all of them to come out being their are at least 150 episodes of each of the above series, each having aired 7 seasons.  By then the new prequel series Enterprise will be only a memory and who knows if they will have been out on tape by then. Hopefully also by then DVDs will be a lot less expensive as a collective (pardon the pun).  In the meanwhile, congratulations to Paramount on finally releasing the entire Classic series and all the movies to date on DVD.",1007942400,5,1923,4.322222222222222
1648883,5,B00005QTAS,"See the episode that started the Star Trek Phenomenon...see who ALMOST was captain of the Enterprise...""The Cage"" shows us where it all began. Jeffrey Hunter turned down the role of the captain. I wonder if he regretted it later.

1648892,4,B00005QTAS,"In 1965, NBC rejected Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's initial pilot, ""The Cage,"" as being ""too cerebral,"" with too many unappealing characters/actors and too little action.  In other words, it was considered too good and too intelligent for the average couch potato -- not to mention, the show' underlying message about enjoying reality vs. a dependence on illusion (i.e. wasting too much time watching TV).  Now, flash forward to 1969: NBC has prematurely cancelled the original `Star Trek' TV series in its 3rd season, but not before releasing ""Turnabout Intruder,"" a mere trifle about one of Captain Kirk's ex-lovers, Dr. Janice Lester, using an alien device to temporarily swap bodies with the captain.  Beyond acknowledging that star William Shatner was probably amused with this concept, the less said about the original TV series' dubious last episode the better.  Hence, curiosity is perhaps the only reason to endure watching this out-of-print DVD's first episode.

However, as previously seen via extended flashbacks in ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II,"" the uncut version of ""The Cage"" remains something to behold.  Combining unused black-and-white footage with its colorized ""Menagerie"" sequences, the hour-long ""Cage"" is a terrific glimpse into the `Trek' that could have been.  Evidently, this `Trek' would have been the Captain Pike show, as only late star Jeffrey Hunter gets an opening credit.  Hunter's solid yet bland performance effectively guides this adventure where a burnt-out Pike is abducted into the mysterious underground alien world of the barren Talos IV.  Guest star Susan Oliver is commendable for her challenging role as enigmatic Vina, as her chemistry with Hunter really clicks in the picnic sequence and then in the tawdry Orion nightclub.

Suffice to say, ""The Cage"" isn't just a cerebral experience - it is pretty provocative television for fifty years ago.  It also makes TV history by showcasing future Trek stars Leonard Nimoy and Majel Barrett (aka M. Leigh Hudec) not only as the first alien and first female bridge officer (Pike's second-in-command, no less) seen on `Star Trek,' but among the first signs of 1960's progression on television itself.  Ironic Note # 1: Nimoy and Barrett are still given relatively little to do, as the only supporting actor with memorable dialogue is John Hoyt's grandpa-like Dr. Boyce.  Ironic Note # 2: Despite Roddenberry's reputation for progressive TV, yes, Oliver's scene as an Orion alien slave girl is pretty sexist, even if it is also a TV first -  the first green-skinned character. (trumping Lou Ferringo's Incredible Hulk by more than a decade).  Ironic Note # 3: For an expensive TV pilot episode that was rejected, it has perhaps the best sci-fi set design and background matte paintings (even for movies) up to that time.

""The Cage"" is simply `Star Trek"" at its best with an original, thought-provoking storyline.  All that is missing is the more charismatic cast that appeared in the actual TV series.  Besides, any TV episode that implores one to recognize that reality matters, so feel blessed and enjoy it as much as you would any fantasy or illusion is definitely worthy of viewer attention.

Rating: 4 stars (Frankly, skip ""Turnabout Intruder"" and watch ""The Cage"" twice instead to get your money's worth).",1399161600,,3300,5.1807909604519775

1648899,4,B00005QTAS,"This DVD contains two versions of the Star Trek pilot ""The Cage"" and the final original series episode ""Turnabout Intruder"". There is a full color version of ""The Cage"" and another which has portions in black and white and color. ""The Cage"" stars Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike, who commands the Enterprise on a mission to a forbidden planet (Talos IV) where illusions are experienced as reality. Parts of this episode were used in the later two part voyage ""The Menagerie"", but it is really interesting to see the pilot in its original form.  It was a really great beginning for Star Trek with a thoughtful, intriguing story, which has been loved and admired by many even though a major television network once rejected it. ""Turnabout Intruder"" was the last episode of the the original series, and while not one of the best stories, it is interesting if not a little strange to see William Shatner play the part of a woman.  Dr. Janice Lester, who envies Kirk, transfers herself into his body and Kirk into hers. An interesting idea but there isn't much beyond the character transfer. However, it is well worth owning this DVD for ""The Cage"", which is not often seen in its original form.

Review for ""Turnabout Intruder""

This was the final episode made for the original series, and apart from the original pilot, it was the last to be aired. I suppose they could have chosen a worse episode to air last like ""Requiem for Methuselah"" or ""Plato's Stepchildren""; compared to those ones ""Turnabout Intruder"" was pretty damn good. But it's really just a mediocre episode at best, and a disappointing end to a great series.

Dr. Janice Lester, who was once involved in a love relationship with Kirk, wants Kirk's command and uses an alien device to switch bodies with him. It is a bit silly at times, but at other times it was quite dramatic. Like when the crew begins to suspect that their captain is no long Jim Kirk, when the crew mutanies, and when Janice sentences Spock and the real Kirk to death. But it's just silly thinking of William Shatner as a woman and it's really unlikely that a woman in the 23rd century wouldn't be allowed a command of her own - one of the reasons she wants Kirk's body, not the only reason, but one of them. I also get creeped out when Shanter (playing Janice Lester) deplays homosexual emotions towards Dr. Arthur Coleman. And the end was crap too. In all, not the worst episode of them all, but certainly not the best either. Two stars.

Review for ""The Cage""

This was the show's first pilot. It was rejected by the network and replaced with a second pilot called ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". Halfway through the show's first season, they started having money problems as well as script problems, and Gene Roddenberry hated wasting his first pilot so he wrote an envelope story around it which became the two-part episode ""The Menagerie"". I still think I like ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" and ""The Menagerie"" better, but this was still a pretty damn good episode. This version of ""The Cage"" is its original version with no envelope story around it and with all filmed scenes included in it. Most of the added scenes were nice to see, but the picnic scene could have been shortened as it was in ""The Menagerie"".

The ENTERPRISE, at this point in time commanded by Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffery Hunter), receives a distress call from an Earth ship on the planet Talos IV. The ENTERPRISE races to the scene only to find out that it's a trap, and Pike is taken prisoner by a group of mysterious telepathic beings! In all, not a bad episode. A pretty good one if you ask me. Four stars.",1264032000,2,2724,4.560327198364008

1648914,5,B00005QTAS,"And so we come full circle with this the final volume of Classic Trek.  This volume is clearly the best one not only of Season 3 but also stands among the best ever among all 3 seasons.  Hence, if you are picking which volumes to keep, this one comes under the ""must have at all costs"" category.

In the first episode, ""The Turnabout Intruder"", we get a Gene Roddenberry credited story about women's lib and the injustice of gender discrimination which leads to desperation among women as they struggle for what's right.  This story is important as it comes at a time when women's lib was a far cry from what it is today showing Gene as a prophet of sorts in championing its cause way back when.  I thought the acting was very good and even William Shatner's impression of a slightly effeminate Kirk attempting to suppress his feminine tendencies so as not to arouse suspicion among the crew as worthy of mention.  While it may not be among the very best of all TOS episodes, it certainly ranks among the top of a very poor 3rd season though.

And now for the creme de la creme of the volume, ""The Cage"" in two versions no less with Gene Roddenberry himself giving the introduction and the final thoughts on the first version while I thought the second version was restored very, very well both in picture and sound quality too.  I have no doubt that had Jeffrey Hunter stayed on and not died an untimely death in real life, he would have been the best Captain the Enterprise ever had; he is by far the best actor of the lot and I include Patrick Stewart as well.  Overall, the acting of all the cast including guest star Susan Oliver, John Hoyt, Peter Duryea and the rest is exceptional.  Even the aliens sent shivers up my spine from their eerie looks to their malevalent stares unlike any of the other aliens from future episodes.  I personally think that this is ironically the best ever Star Trek TOS episode even if Spock is the only character that remains in future episodes.

As Gene Roddenberry has long gone to the next life, this volume is even more a collector's item as it has his thoughts on the episode and on the impact TOS has had overall up to the mid-80s when this was shot.  Overall, this is a must have volume for all Trek fans and indeed all fans of sci-fi television everywhere.

Very highly recommended.

Updated on July 14, 2012:

Amazon won't let me review the blu-ray releases separately and so I have to append it here; the difference is like night and day!  This long-time trekker is mostly satisfied as we get both the original and the ""souped-up"" versions here and for me the new versions are very, very good indeed.  Both the picture and sound qualities have improved immensely and here in season 3 we have TOS as best as it can be; finally, definitive versions of my favourite ever tv series!  Even the packaging is satisfying as it doesn't take up nearly as much shelf space as any of the other previous releases; it the size of the usual one disc blu ray we get the entire third season in 6 discs. Sure this is not the best of the 3 seasons with the infamous ""Spock's Brain"" among the episodes here but many of my favourite TOS episodes are here like: ""The Enterprise Incident"", ""The Paradise Syndrome"", ""Spectre of the Gun"", ""For the World ... the Sky"", ""Plato's Stepchildren"" and ""The Empath"".  Overall, there is little for Star Trek fans to complain about in this blu-ray release of season 3.

Very highly recommended!",1174176000,3,3456,4.4976
1648915,5,B00005QTAS,"""Turnabout Intruder"" is not worth reviewing, except to see how inconsistently the attitudes toward women were handled--compare Lester  to Number One and Yeoman Colt in the pilot.

*

""The Cage"" is two things. First, it is not the Star Trek that could have been, but rather, it is the Star Trek that was to be.  All of the key elements are in place: Dr. Boyce is the same archetype as Dr. McCoy, Ensign Jose Tyler is the eager young space cadet that would become Chekhov and every redshirt, Yeoman Colt is just a strawberry version of Yeoman Rand, and Spock is Spock. If you squint, you feel like you are watching any other episode of Trek:TOS or TAS.

Secondly, this is what ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" should have been.  When I heard that Berman and Braga were doing a prequel series, I immediately picture this episode's yellow and blue turtlenecks,  the Buck Rodgers lasers, and the retro-future trans-warp d&eacute;cor on the ship.  Like most people, I was let down with the slick and professional sets and costuming of the actual series.  No!  No! No!  Keep the continuity of the Great Bird of the Galaxy!  We love the quirky sets, post-Mod swinger costumes, and the cheesy special effects.  ""But pardon, gentles all, the flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object. . . . Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts."" (Henry V)

*

""The Cage"" is a reservoir--it both collects from the past, and dispenses for the future.  In order to fully appreciate this series, you need to read Horatio Hornblower, Doc Smith's Lensman series, and the watch ""Forbidden Planet.""  The last film was a key influence on the plot and setting.  In both, we have a dying or dead alien race that was corrupted by its telepathic abilities and moved underground.  Both have a saucer-shaped  earth ship with hyper drive coming to the rescue, wit a beautiful woman (Altair /Vina) as a siren.  Even the sets have similar pentagonal doors and arches. And don't get me started on the animation and special effects.

This episode shows that the concept of Star Trek was already firm in Roddenberry's mind.  In addition to the above mentioned similarities, you have the quote-unquote progressive crew. The transporter assistant is Asian, foreshadowing Admiral Sulu.  The navigator is Jose Tyler, blond, but with Hispanic ancestry.  And of course, there is Number One, a female XO that paved the way for Robotech's Lisa Hayes. Nowadays some people criticize Roddenberry for not being politically correct enough, but considering the times, this is quite daring.

Additionally there is the personality of Pike.  What we saw in ""The Menagerie"" was edited; we saw an introspective captain, with his doubts and fears.  But when these snippets are put in context, we see that Pike was a tough tinhorn on par with Kirk--just replay the last line Pike speaks in the episode.  Furthermore, since Pike is both velvet and steel, he is a better rounded person that Kirk ever was. I think it was this balanced quality that allowed Hunter to play Christ so well in ""King of Kings.""

*

There is one odd aspect to the episode, and that is the sexual subtext: the Talosians want Pike to breed with Vina.  Nowadays we would just send the Greys to the local sperm bank for some free samples, or have Riker do a strafing run.  But Pike does not do this--he has a sense of the sacredness of marriage, that a heterogamous couple is essential for both the man, woman, and the child.  As the children of broken homes can attest, we seem to have advanced beyond Pike in this matter.",1171238400,3,3584,4.7459546925566345
1648916,5,B00005QTAS,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz (""I Love Lucy"" tv series) bought RKO and formed DESILU studios.  It was Lucille Ball that gave the go-ahead for them to make the Star Trek pilot.  Creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, went to CBS first, but they were already planning ""Lost In Space"".
  So they went to NBC. This 1964 pilot was unsold and never did air on television in its entirety until 1988.
  By not broadcasting this 1964 version, NBC chose to film a second pilot with Leonard Nimoy returning as ""Spock"", but with William Shatner as  ""James T. Kirk"" instead.

  This story is set a few years before the events in the motion picture, STAR TREK (2009).

  ""The Cage"" begins with Captain Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) and science officer, Mister Spock (Leonard Nimoy) who is a vulcan (with emotions).  Majel Barrett is Number One.
  Captain Pike and his crew visit the Planet Talos, looks similar to Arizona.  They find a Hawaiian-like plant, but light blue and chiming like the transporters do. They find survivors along with a beautiful women, Vina (Susan Olivier). Pike is lead away by Vina and suddenly it is a trap.  Pike is held hostage by three superior beings.  Their brains are three times the size of a normal humans.
Also in the cast: Laurel Goodwin, Peter Duryea, John Hoyt.
  Jeffery Hunter decided not to continue his Star Trek role.

  A second pilot (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") was ordered, this one with William Shatner as ""Captain Kirk"", Leonard Nimoy returning a ""Spock"" (now without emotions), DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols.  It was sent to NBC and in February 1966, NBC bought the show and placed it on the Autumn schedule.  STAR TREK premiered  September 8, 1966 with the episode, The Man Trap"", NBC 8:30pm.

1648918,5,B00005QTAS,"I am not a Trekkie by any stretch of the imagination, but I've always loved 'The Cage'. The story is one of the most interesting of all the episodes. For an early 1960's film on it's own, it borders on amazing. The whole episode is how should we say....dreamy. The entire cast seams to float along as if in a sleepy daze. It makes me wonder if the cast and director were all on some weird 60's drugs.

Sur-realism, memories, and mind control are the name of the game here, and the big headed aliens can make your life heaven or hell, depending on how you behave. I thought Captain Pike was great, much better than Pricard, but not quite as good as Kirk. Maybe he could have fit into the series somewhere, but I think he leaves a great legacy as a one-time captain.

Everyone thinks the 'big' scene is Mr. Spock smiling and grinning stupidly at some vibrating cardboard flowers, but they are wrong.

Susan Oliver as Vina, oh how beatiful she is. I have always been infatuated with green skinned slave girls anyway. I've made several bids for them, but always fall short cash wise (maybe a dylithium mine would help). Wathing Susan dance half-naked in her green body paint is much too seductive for 1960s and is possibly why the series was not picked up. I can see the producers now thinking ""What the hell bloody show are you perverts trying to make? This is 1964 for crying out loud! Slave women who dance for their owners? Barbarians!""

Well I sit and watch Sweet Vina dance and dance and dance. I never get tired of her. If I was Pike I would have told Spock to fly off without me. I would have made sure the aliens kept her as the 'Green Illusion' and supplied them with a whole herd of slaves to do their manual labor. Sure when you saw her in her real state she was pretty messed up, but no worse than my ex-wife when she woke up with a hangover Sunday morning.",1121817600,3,1866,4.322857142857143
1648919,5,B00005QTAS,"Other reviews have said much of what I'm about to say, but there's safety in numbers when one is about to plunk down ~$18 for a single ST DVD.

The primary reason to own this DVD is to see the restored Cage episode.  It literally brought tears to my eyes to see the restored footage carefully put back together in a coherent color-corrected fashion.  Imagine after so many years of watching ST reruns you accidentally find that you hadn't seen them all!  Revelatory.

In fact, many years ago, that's what happened to me with Turnabout Intruder (which clearly wasn't being shown in reruns very often) since one night I turned on the TV and had to check the program listings twice and yes, there it was...an ST episode I somehow failed to see.  OK, now in 2005, even I have to admit a bit of treker embarrassment over the dialogue and the silly court scenes...but seeing Capt. Kirk in Laura Ashley mode always brings a fey smile to my face, and to others, I'm sure.",1111104000,2,963,4.474285714285714
1648920,5,B00005QTAS,"Unlike others, I will not take the time to review ""The Cage."" My five stars mainly reflect the content of this episode, worth watching and owning. The praise heaped upon this pilot episode by others is largely accurate and deserved.  Love the Captain.  Love Number One.  Love the landing party jackets.  As many mention, it would have been interesting to see what direction the series might have gone from this launching point.

However, I take to task anyone who cannot appreciate the humor (intended or not) of the campy ""Turnabout Intruder.""  Of course it is not the best episode ever, it arguably may be the worst.  However, taken out of the context of the overall show, it is a tour de force for William Shatner's hammy scene stealing acting.  Shatner goes over the top ""implying"" femininity, and comes off just plain gay.  From filing his nails to a girly giggle, he's totally fey.  Left with no space babe to molest, he has a number of one on one scenes with male Dr. Coleman.  One wonders how that relationship was going to play out.

Contrasting Shatner's performance to that of Sandra Smith, is like comparing apples to oranges.  While she may not have Kirk's mannerisms or voice inflection, she does manage to successfully convey a sense of isolation and panic.  Regardless of the limitations of the story, her depiction of one personality being locked in another body is strong.  While Shatner overplays his part to literal hysteria, Smith keeps her performance tight and controlled.  Considering the material, she is actual very watchable.

I will agree with all others, that the overall attitude towards women is appalling.  From the opening lines about the limited opportunities for women to the last (""Her life could have been as rich as any woman's...""), the tone is patronizing, especially considering the series usual forward thinking nature.  The idea that women remain subordinate to men in any field, even in the late `60's seems anachronistic.

Viewed with some degree of tongue in cheek and removed from the formal ""Star Trek"" genre, I believe this episode does contain numerous enjoyable moments.  With a nod to ""Fatal Attraction,"" Janice Lester will not be ignored.",1098144000,9,2191,4.947945205479452
1648921,4,B00005QTAS,"I'm just gonna go ahead & skip any kind of review of ""Turnabout Intruder"".  More eloquent slams of this episode have been made by others, so there's no need to go into it again.
The primary reson to buy this DVD (whether you're a die-hard Trek geek or just a casual sci-fi fan) is to see the unaired, uncut 1964 pilot, ""THE CAGE"", and Roddenberry really had it on the money with this one.
Jeffrey Hunter's turn as Captain Christopher Pike exudes the stern, stoic demeanour that would become such a trademark of Jean-Luc Picard, yet he does manage to showcase a glimpse into his humanity, which he keeps hidden from most of the crew, as every good captain must.  There are moments in this pilot that act as harbingers of things that audiences would take for granted some thirty years hence on other incarnations of TREK, but they'll more than likely fail to remember or appreciate that it ALL began here.  Without this pilot, there would be no Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway, or Archer.
The SPFX in this show, while cheesy by today's ILM-on-Steroids standards, were surprisingly good & still manage to impress, even today.  This pilot, which was ultimately refused by NBC (Shatner's ""WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE"" was what finally sold the suits on the show), is TREK at its most distilled.  There was really no guideline to go by, no Prime Directive, no purists' / revisionists' history, no continuity to adhere to, no writers' staff to make sure everything fit in the box -- just plain ol', good character-driven science fiction TV.
It's a shame that there wasn't an opportunity to see where Jeffrey Hunter & HIS Enterprise crew would have gone, but thank goodness he was there at all.",1076371200,,1684,4.694915254237288
1648932,4,B00005QTAS,"I only give this one four stars because the final episode--""Turnabout Intruder""--was pretty lame.  Bad way to end the series.  The inclusion of two versions of ""The Cage"" makes the DVD worthwhile, however, along with Gene Roddenberry's little featurette.  One point of contention with Jared's review:  ""The Cage"" has, in fact, aired during reruns.  While I still have my ""all-colour collector's edition"" VHS copy, it was played at least once on the Sci-Fi Channel, back when Sci-Fi ran sort of a 23rd-century two-hour program block (Star Trek the first hour, and Babylon 5 the second, which is when I actually got into J. Michael Straczynski's television gem).
I only watched the the B&W/Color version of ""The Cage,"" once for the novelty of it.",1076025600,,744,5.016260162601626
1648933,3,B00005QTAS,"Roddenberry's original pilot plus the reworked version which showed up as the two part episode The Menagerie are included on this DVD. The former shows a television series with promise. It's a solid, very good pilot episode although it was missing important elements. It's clear why NBC rejected the original;most of the cast lacked the chemistry of Shatner-Nimoy-Kelly.
When it was reworked into The Menagerie, the wrap around story devised by story editor John D. F. Black provieded added punch to the original pilot; there was the seeming betrayal of Kirk by Spock and the tragedic accident that disabled Christopher Pike. This episode won a Hugo (much deserved I might add) for the efforts of Roddenberry and Black (although Black never received credit and, assuming Roddenberry would take care of him, never took it to arbitration. It never happened). The Menagerie focuses on Spock highjacking the Enterprise to take Pike back to a planet where an alien race once imprisoned him. The dying race hoped to pass along their values and use Pike as breeding stock in an effort to survive. They pitted him against real incidents from his past and imaginery situations using the power of illusion to try and break him down.
Kirk catches up with Spock and a Court Martial is initiated against Kirk's first officer. Spock, in his defense, wants to show Pike's story to give the other officers an understanding as to why he behaved the way he did. It turns out that Federation ships are forbidden to visit the planet which complicates matters for Spock.
Everyone gives terrific performances particularly Shatner, guest star Thorne and Nimoy. The material is reworked into a powerful episode.
Turnabout Intruder was the last episode of the original series broadcast. It's based on a story by Roddenberry. Unfortunately, it's not the best episode and the only highlight is the terrific acting from the regular and guest cast.
 3 1/2 stars for the original pilot, 4 1/2 for the reworked version and 2 stars for Turnabout Intruder with an average of 3 1/2 stars for all three.",1062374400,3,2068,4.959654178674351
1648934,3,B00005QTAS,"It is obvious that Turnabout Intruder was meant to be a slap in the face of the NBC suits who tried to kill Star Trek.  The plot and story were cliche in the extreme; I can't imagine Gene Roddenberry signing off on something like this if he wasn't completely offended by the way NBC treated him and his creation.  That being said, anyone who says William Shatner cannot act should screen this episode.  One could tell that there was considerable effort expended in getting the acting job ""just right.""  This wasn't just any ""contractual obligation"" job; this was art.
As for the pilot, I always thought the tone was a lot closer to Star Trek - The Next Generation.  The bridge was a lot quieter than it usually was in the original series, and the acting was far less ""over the top.""  With a little more work, and a lot more money, this could easily have been done to cinematic standards.  One can easily imagine a remake directed by Stephen Spielberg.",1051574400,4,951,4.526315789473684
1648935,3,B00005QTAS,"The final DVD of The 40 volume Star Trek DVD series contians the series incredibly weak and uneven finale and special treat: the unaired original pilot that NBC rejected which is what really sells this one.
It's a real shame that the Star Trek series couldn't have ended a little better than TURNABOUT INTRUDER but sadly it's this awful episode that ends a TV series that still had a ton of promising aspects left in it.  Looking back it's easy to say that Star Trek should never been cancelled so early.  It's also easy to say that an episode this bad should have never ended the series.  TURNABOUT INTRUDER does have to be one of the worst Star Trek episodes to go into production.  The plot is simply goofy and weak.  A deranged woman swapping her soul into Kirk's body in order for her to fufill her dreams on running a starship is a bad enough idea.  However having William Shatner act like a lady trapped inside a man's body is just a sad joke.  Shatner (who at the time was suffering from a severe fever during the filming of this episode) turns in perhaps his worst acting performance  ever in the series.  It's so bad that it's laughable but this episode is downright boring and I wouldn't doubt that poor William Shatner (who I feel is generally a decent actor) begged for another episode of Star Trek to end the series on a stronger note.  Unfortunetly this never happend.
The real reason to buy this DVD is of course the unaired pilot THE CAGE.  It's not really available anywhere else and has never been included in the TV reruns.  It's interesting to watch and see Jeffrey Hunter as Cpt. Pike and a younger more emotional Spock.  The episode is pretty good but is ment more for historical or cult purposes.  Still it what saves this DVD from being awful.
In conclusion this DVD is still a must despite the awful sad finale.  The pilot is essential for Trekkies and is a must see anyways for fans of the Original series like me.  This is classic Trek despite the depressing ending of the series so it's recommended but mainly for the Pilot.
*I can't believe I reviewed all forty volumes!*",1048204800,13,2101,4.489473684210527
1648936,5,B00005QTAS,"""Turnabout Intruder"" is only watchable if you have both: a) consumed adult beverages immediately prior to watching; and b) are looking for something incredibly bad to laugh at.  This one is so bad that when I saw it on TV I KNEW that the series was going to be cancelled.  No more money for scripts.  That's all there is to be said about that.
On the other hand, ""The Cage"" is a wonderful find.  As every Trekkie knows, this is the original pilot of the series, which was never presented on television because the TV executives told Roddenberry that he had to make changes.  For example, the idea of a woman second-in-command was more than they could handle.  Well, it was 1966.
""The Cage"" is a superb episode which captures the optimism and wonder that the best ""Star Trek"" episodes brought to the screen.  Mankind has only been exploring other star systems a short time.  The Enterprise encounters a new race with powerful mental abilities, which race has hostile intentions.  All of the ingredients for a fine story, and that is exactly what this is.  One of the flaws in The Original Series after awhile in my opinion was that the Galaxy became too well-known and well-travelled, the aliens too familiar.  Here, the Enterprise is meeting a new race that is not known.  And the Talosians (the new race) are plausible and believable.
I loved William Shatner in the Trek series, but here we have a different actor--one Jeffrey Hunter.  (He was dropped from the series, evidently the studio couldn't cut a deal with him).  Hunter is a very different captain of the Enterprise.  I thought he lacked chemistry with the other characters--he was more aloof than Kirk, and lacked Kirk/Shatner's ability to occasionally laugh at himself.  Having said that, Hunter had his own strengths--I thought he did a good job projecting the notion that he was in command.  He is a self-doubting, self-critical captain.
Spock in this episode is quite different from the Spock of the actual series--he smiles occasionally, but nonetheless does not seem quite human as indeed he is not.  I liked the technology and sets in this episode too: I always thought it was asinine that Landing Parties wore their aboard-ship uniforms down even to pretty hostile planets.  In ""The Cage"" they do not do this.
The worst ""Star Trek"" episodes in my opinion were episodes that refused to deal with the limitless possibilities of human travel to other worlds, and meetings with other civilizations.  There is no need for time travel, stupid fantasy about magic, Greek Gods, the Roman Empire, etc.  ""The Cage"" is a fine episode that deals with what the show was supposed to be about: seeking out new life and civilizations....!

""The Cage"" is probably one of the best science fiction movies made.  Its influence on all that followed is obvious, even beyond the Star Trek series itself.",1032134400,3,406,4.611111111111111
1648939,5,B00005QTAS,"""Turnabout Intruder"" may be considered merely a bonus on this DVD  -  it's worth the price of admission just for the two versions of Star Trek's original pilot episode, ""The Cage.""  Series creator Gene Roddenberry only ever wrote one great script, and ""The Cage"" is it.  It's truly inspired.
The Enterprise is brought to desolate planet Talos IV by a dim distress signal, where the landing party discovers survivors from a crash almost twenty years ago  -  only the survivors are a clever illusion, created by the subterranean inhabitants of the planet as a lure to abduct Captain Christopher Pike.  As in most contemporary UFO reports, the Talosians are short, bald, frail creatures, that communicate telepathically and attempt to use their abductee for purposes of human procreation  -  their race perished in nuclear war, aeons ago, and they wish to create a race of humans to accomplish their labor for them and to vicariously live through.  While the Enterprise desperately tries to find a way to breach the Talosians' underground city and recover their kidnapped captain, Pike is teased and tortured by illusions into cooperating with the superior  -  and ruthless  -  Talosians.
This is a brilliant episode, beautifully produced, wonderfully written and splendidly acted.  It's dramatic and emotionally engaging, suspenseful and fascinating from start to finish.  Jeffrey Hunter manages to credibly walk a tightrope role as Captain Pike, alternately helpless and violently rebellious, and guest star Susan Oliver is excellent as Pike's tormented fellow captive and proposed breeding mate.  Majel Barrett, who later played Nurse Chapel (and became Mrs. Roddenberry), plays the commanding second on the Enterprise, Number One, with a more emotional Spock in the slightly lesser role as merely the ship's science officer.
The best thing about this DVD is that it provides both versions of this magnificent pilot.  The patched black-and-white into color version shows those scenes and lines cut from the finished version due to the sexual mores of the time; the color version patches the same into an all-color whole, so you can't see the splicing.  It's a piece of unique T.V. history, well worth a place not only on any Star Trek fan's shelf, but on the shelves of film and media students.
""Turnabout Intruder,"" the series' final episode, is far less distinguished, but nowhere near as bad as many critics make it out to be.  The plot is clever, about a woman jealous of Kirk's power utilizing an alien device to trade bodies with him and take over the Enterprise.  Sandra Smith does a little bit better job of playing the Kirk-in-the-woman than William Shatner does of the woman-in-the-Kirk, the latter occasionally  -  though less often than you might think  -  coming off a bit campy, and Harry Landers is oddly kind of touching as Smith's long-suffering loyal helpmeet.

B) The original piot TV Special airing ""The Cage"" - the original pilot when they only had the orignal black and white prints and used material from another two-part episode - ""The Menagerie"". This is because the original full color print was thought to be lost in the Paramount Vaults. (Apparently found int he 80's)
C)The very last episode to air. ""Turnabout Intruder"". (William Shatner gets to play a woman!)
Basically you are getting three epsiode. See Spock before he was the Spock we knew. The Doctor before McCoy and a female in the ""second in command"" position. (The wife of Gene Roddenberry, the Creator, himself - Majel Barret who later is Nurse Christine Chapel.)
The costumes were espcially influced by the 60's. And the props, well, you just have to see them.
