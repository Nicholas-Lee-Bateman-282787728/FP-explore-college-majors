I have vague memories of this movie when it aired on the late show during the early 1980's. This was considered one of those movies you're not supposed to watch when you're young, and because of the adult nature in terms of what can happen on a psychiatric ward of a hospital, I can see why.

What I remember as a kid was a woman being admitted to a psych ward whom kept claiming she was stable and denies trying to kill herself. Watching this film now, the storyline is believable from the opening where Kelly, the main character, is unknowingly poisoned when a drug is slipped into her drink, the assumptions made upon doctors that she is suicidal and paranoid, and even the abuse and coercion that goes on behind closed doors from male staff that can cover up their wrongdoings by insisting these people are ""crazy.""

You will come to really like the character of Kelly and her kind-hearted nature as she reaches out to some of the other patients, while showing her determination to prove her sanity. Plus the ending will shock you despite feeling like somebody got exactly what they deserved.",1373846400,4,1192,4.591549295774648

Dianne Hull plays Kelly, a friendly girl who works at a disco club (not sure what as!), who has a sudden seizure one night while dancing and is rushed to hospital. When it is found that she has strychnine poisoning, Kelly claims that she has been poisoned, but alas for her, no-one believes her and she is sent to a psychiatrist as a possible suicide, which, due to a few more misunderstandings, leads her to being incarcerated on the ""Fifth Floor"", which is a special secure ward for the insane. Can she establish her sanity and get out of the place and back to normality? What I liked about the film is that it plays the scenario of Kelly's plight out quite seriously. The more she complains, accuses the staff of lying and refuses to take treatment ( a very good performance here by Dianne Hull), the more deeply she gets herself trapped. While watching you find yourself thinking: ""Yes I guess that's exactly what a mad person would do and say as well"", and her plight struck me as all too believable. The biggest spanner in the works for poor Kelly is a corrupt and lascivious orderly called Carl (effectlively played by Bo Hopkins) who likes to sexually assault the younger female inmates and then blame their later accusations on hysteria. He takes a shine to Kelly and the two scenes in which he abuses her are quite unpleasant. Thrown into this are some good minor performances by the other inmates that Kelly befriends, including a pregnant girl called Cathy and a seriously unhappy and troubled woman named Melanie, played with genuine feeling and impressive intensity by Sharon Farrell.

So, although the plot is nothing new (sane person committed to an asylum by mistake), the film does a good job of handling it. Although the situation is kept small scale, you can certainly feel for the central character, and with great performances all round and a couple of rather surprisingly brutal scenes, it all goes towards making ""The Fifth Floor"" a place you really should visit.",1186617600,6,2199,4.679586563307494
