8714388,5,B00WUKI064,"An excellent performance of this delightful opera. The principals are superb, especially the sisters. Bruscantini as Don Alfonso is past his prime, but he knows and understands the role inside out, so one does not even notice his vocal limitations. Araiza is in top form as Ferrando, and Morris makes virile Guglielmo. The only disappointment is Battle as Despina. Unlike her partners, she does not have feel for the Mozart ensemble, and her vocal mannerisms are totally unbecoming. How the producers allowed that to happen is a mystery. Muti's conducting is terrific, much better than on his La Scala video, where he is uninvolved. Comparing the two, this performance (Salzburg) is far preferable to the La Scala. The picture and the sound are good, considering the time of the recording. Recommended, despite the Battle fiasco.",1454198400,3,829,5.148148148148148
