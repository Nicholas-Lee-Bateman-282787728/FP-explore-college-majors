2102846,5,B0002LE9FO,"We picked this up at the video store because we wanted a fluffy, cheesy slasher flick.  This movie did not disappoint.  It even had some great one-liners that I wish I had written down 'cause I can't remember them now.

It was not scary at all and none of the scenes were realistic or unnerving.  We just settled in with our popcorn and cocoa and had a great time with the foolishness of it all.",1098144000,6,395,4.226666666666667
2102847,1,B0002LE9FO,"If you enjoy those movies like I Know What you Did Last Summer, and the like...

...you know the ones where they have the beautiful teen models all posing in pyramid form on the cover, with a phantom image of the movie's killer somewhere in the background. Then I'm sure you'll love this! From what I understand it features a couple of teen stars, and the guy who made it must be an Evil Dead fanatic due to the fact that he included a picture of Bruce in his movie.

 Non of the actors are horribly bad...

...on the other hand they really don't have much of a challenge set before them. Basically all the characters are the same person. They are young, happy, trendy, dress like raver dorks, and they like sex. Infact this movie makes sex more of a focal point to cover up the fact that they did not spend any of there budget on special effects, let alone a decent script writer. EVERY special effect (what few there are) is done by cheap computer animation, aside of two badly done severed heads which you don't see till the end of the movie, and of course a few blood spills. Aside of that there is NO Evil Dead effects anywhere to be seen in this film.

 What is Evil Dead like is the plot, which is a blatant rip off of the Evil Dead script, only it is made gay. For one, the evil professor is a horrible actor and in no way comes across as a man who possesses knowledge from beyond the grave. Secondly, the possessed people in this film don't look much different from whey they are possessed. Simlpy all that was done is the crappy effects ""artists"" made there cheeks look a tad bit swollen, and there eye browes really fluffy. Nothing near as kool in what you'll find in Evil Dead.

 Another thing is there version of the Book Of The Dead in this film convenient features an English translation on the other side of the page...

...ya a book that is thousands of years old, happens to not only be written in Latin (ok maybe it's not and original), but just so happens to be translated into modern day American english on the other side of the page.

I think this movie was written and filmed by a 3rd grade kid, and was desinged to be marketed to 4 year olds.

I dunno, buy it if you want, but if you are looking for a classic, look elsewhere, this is NOT it. It's not even fun like Friday The 13th was in all it's cheese, hell even Friday the 13th could toss lots of sex in the movie without making it seem cheesey or overboard. This movie sux...

...hey, maybe if we have sex we can stop the evil!

P.S. I didn't make that up, it's in the movie.",1097712000,3,2555,4.211065573770492
2102848,3,B0002LE9FO,"I thought this movie had some genuinely funny moments. The movie never managed to be scary, but it worked well as a horror comedy. One of the female leads (the chick that plays the Playboy bunny) steals the movie about halfway through. This actress alone is worth the rental due to her quick, unexpected character change; you'll have to see the movie to understand what I'm talking about. Overall I thought this movie was kind of a ""Night of the Demons"" rip-off. It's worth a watch, but don't expect a great work of art.",1097625600,11,520,4.542553191489362
2102849,5,B0002LE9FO,"This horror flick has you on the edge of your seat - wanting to know what is going to happen next and the twists and turns add to the suspense - and when they hit - boy do they ever hit hard!

The film builds slowly in the beginning, but once it takes off - it does so with sheer entertainment.  I know this is true, because it grabbed a hold of my wife - and didn't let her go until the film ended.  Understand, she isn't a fan of horror flicks, so the fact that she was compelled to know how it would end - is in itself a testament to the writer.

The actresses are hot - and I mean really hot, and the acting is damn good.  There is also a touch of humor - delivered at just the right time.

I highly recommend this DVD - for I promise you, you won't be disappointed.",1097107200,12,770,3.8417721518987342
2102850,2,B0002LE9FO,"I watched this movie because it was supposed to be Brooke Burke's feature film debut.

She's the incredibly-stunning babe from the E! Channel and I wanted to see her in a film role.  If that's why you're checking this movie out, you need to keep this in mind: she appears in the first scene and then she's gone.  She looks great.  But then she's gone for the rest of the movie.

The rest of the movie plays like the cheap campy horror flicks of the 1980s.  In fact, it plays so much like one that it might as well be one.

I liked the cast and, since we're using the 80s horror flick scale, the two girls look great naked, but there really isn't anything more here than we've already seen before.  The script is definitely 80s slasher lame.

I actually feel a little guilty because I watched the extras and everyone appears to be so earnest and energetic about this movie.

Except the movie didn't turn out so cool.",1095292800,3,915,4.329411764705882
2102851,5,B0002LE9FO,"I have to say, for a low budget, straight to video film, this movie just plain rocks!  I mean, it's funny, the script is strong, the acting is great, the direction is tight, and the effects are well done.  Everything that I could have wanted was in here, plus more.

Let us start with the technical side of things.  This disc is very well done.  The picture is sharp and crisp, and the sound is clear and strong.  Also, there are some very nice extras with a behind the scenes video, and some interviews, as well as trailers and other assorted goodies.  The movie itself is one that goes back to the days of Night of the Demons, Return of the Living Dead, and Hell Night.  It uses a tired old cliche of a plot, and turns it on it's head with some very nice dialogue, a good sense of humor, and strong characters.  It also helps that the cast handles everything amazingly.  Everyone not only seems great on their own, but they all compliment each other so well that this really is a well done ensamble piece.  The movie also looks like it should have had a wide theatrical release.  The cheap, close up nature of most straight to video flicks, and instead is so well directed that I never once thought that this was a low budget production.  It also helps that the effects are very well done, and never pull you out of the action (which is almost non-stop).  And while the humor is previlant, it does not over take the horror of the film, but instead adds to the depth of the characters.

High Recommended.",1095120000,24,1505,4.344086021505376
2102852,3,B0002LE9FO,"Here in Aus it's called ""Dead Scared"" and I picked it up because I liked the look of Tiffany Shepis in the silver jumpsuit and I'm partial to a bit of shlock horror.

From the outset it's pretty low budget with some of the special effects comming up short, and for me it wasn't quite gory enough, quite timid in fact.

The characters are what you expect from American teen horror films and all the sterotypes were there, but none of the actors gave a bad performance which makes the film enjoyable, and there's a couple of unexpected twists which are a nice change.

I enjoyed it and would soon watch it again. Good shlocky fun.",1242691200,2,628,4.396551724137931
2102853,4,B0002LE9FO,"The Hazing is a b-horror comedy starring Brad Dourif as Professor Kapps. Dourif (from ""Child's Play series"" and ""Urban Legend""), dabbles with the occult and can go through 'portals' thanks to a book of evil.

When he kills an assistant (Brooke Burke), the movie then shifts to a fratenity/sorority where a group of people are ordered to get several items for Halloween before they enter a house where several murders happened decades before....

When a boy and girl enter the house through the window, they steal the book and as Professor Kapps is injured, they flee and, thinking he's dead, leave the house but after the girl sees bodies in the house.

While in Hospital, Kapps uses his powers of evil to possess certain people until a girl (Tiffany Shepis), and her friends try and stop the Professor from turning them into demons....

Writer/director Rolfe Kanefsky borrowed from Tom de Simone's ""Hell Night"" (1981) and Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" (1982), to make a low budget, but fun movie that one of the better b movies around.

Shepis is great and the young cast is perfect. Dourif is solid and I recommend this movie.

2102854,5,B0002LE9FO,"The Hazing was everything that most theatrical horror releases SHOULD be nowadays--yet this movie somehow was overlooked as a Halloween release in 2004.  What beat this movie out of a release slot? Was it Seed of Chucky?!!?  An ""amusing"" movie without a doubt, but far inferior to this little-known gem.

Now I must admit: this is a ""silly"" horror movie.  Think the Night of the Demons series (part 2, in particular), and make it a little MORE silly; like Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Warriors.  But this movie is much more similar to the former, taking place in ""Hack House"", a name strangely similar to the ""Hell House"", ""Hill House"", and ""Hull House"" of various other nearly identically-premised films.  But you know what?  I don't care that it's a serially violated and re-packaged premise because this time it paid off in full!

Most importantly, while this is a low budget flick, I found myself having to remind myself of this fact--I would not have guessed.  The effects were tactfully simple but truly no less entertaining.  The film quality, music and sound effects were in league with theatrical horror films (the ones that SHOULD actually be theatrical releases).  The frequent humor was delivered with surprisingly good timing by little known, but unexpectedly good actors.  Oh, and the pace of action was strong after the much slower character-developing start of the movie, which, still, was rather entertaining.

A final note: nothing in this movie is scary, and if you jump it was due to unexpectedness and not actual fright.  This is for those who love the style of horror of the movies referenced in this review.",1229904000,3,1634,4.8945454545454545
2102855,5,B0002LE9FO,"Since we're quickly closing in on Halloween, everyone's favorite non-holiday, I couldn't resist reviewing this little gem which was directed and written by Rolfe Kanefsky and released to an unsuspecting,and mostly unappreciative audience in 2001. THE HAZING tells the story of a group consisting of three fraternity and two sorority pledges who are undergoing that cherished titular right of passage. Their's consists of a scavenger hunt followed by the required night in the town's local haunted house, ""Hack"" House, where one Mr. Hackford murdered his wife and her lover in a rather nasty fashion.

The film itself begins in a most promising manner with a voice over the credits telling us the history of an ancient tome known as the ""Saviour of Souls"". How it had first been found in the ruins of an ancient monestary, ""a gift from God, or the Devil himself... filled with pages of blood rituals that could free the pure of soul from the bonds of the material world, indeed from death itself. Corrupt monks twisted the Book's purpose and began using its passages for unspeakable rites. A lone brother opposed them. He attempted to destroy the Book's power, but by then it was too late and the Evil consumed him. The entire monestary perished in a terrible fire. Miraculously the Book survived, its dark purpose now fulfilled. Its passages created a gateway allowing lost souls to travel freely between the dimensions of the living and of the dead.""  Cool. The man reciting the Book's history is Professor Kapp (Brad Dourif) and his real audience is his student Jill (Brooke Burke) who seems to be trying to get a few points added on to her grade by sucking up to the good Professor by whatever means necessary. She coyly excuses herself to change into a costume for a Halloween party she plans to attend, and emerges just in time to become the Professor's first sacrifical victim. As he politely explains to her before delivering the coup de grace, ""Its all true."" The Book has merely been awaiting the unhurried sacrifice of human beings, and she was in the wrong place at the right time.

OKAY! I can put up with a certain amount of collegiate bull excrement if we have stuff like this added to the mix. Looks like it could be fun. Speaking of our potential frat boys and co-eds it looks as if our sterotypes are all in place. Yes, they've donned Halloween costumes and divided into two teams for the scavenger hunt. Team One has Doug, a semi-obnoxious take-charge kinda guy and Marsha (Tiffany Shepis) a seriously strong chick who IS in charge. Team Two consists of Roy the good-natured, beer-swilling, sex-crazed sterotype, Delia (Nectar Rose) the dumb blonde in the Playboy Bunny outfit, and Tim (Parry Shen) who is Chinese, enough said. Right? Team Two is going for the small point items on the scavenger list, but Doug sees the Book of Souls on the list and recognizes it as belonging to Prof Kapp and decides not to sweat the small stuff and go right for the Big Ticket Item. This one is worth 30 points! Marsha's past dating history has left her with some knowledge of breaking and entering, so they clamber in through the kitchen window, split up, find the professor going about the slightly tawdry business of human sacrifice, and accidentally impale him on one of his own collectibles. Being basically good kids who don't want to get expelled or imprisoned they call 911, leave the phone hanging so the call will be traced, grab everything they have touched, and exit the way the entered. Marsha's right to his jaw convinces Doug that they should not tell the others about what has happened.

Now all our characters are finally in place and the fun can REALLY begin. We all know, as do most of the characters in the film, that Jacob and Justine, the heads of the Fraternity and the Sorority, have rigged the house with all sorts of little things to scare them. But we know something they do not, that the Book, and maybe even the Professor, are going to cause some problems that no one has anticipated. The only question remaining is does this film have anything to offer that the scores of other films of its type do not? The answer is, most definitely!

What do we want from these films? Scares some say. But who really gets scared by this sort of stuff anymore? There aren't any ""truly frightening"" moments here although there are some interesting ones. Gore you say? Well there are a couple of characters who are covered with the red stuff,  there's a beheading, and one fairly imaginative sex scene that I would put in this category--in fact it was one of the highlights of the film for me. Sex? there is that one rather demure scene I just mentioned, apart from that there's a decent (or indecent) amount of exposed breasts, this was after all from Rolfe Kanefsky, even though it was probably one of the most clothed films he's done since THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE. Special Effects? Enough to get by on. Some have criticized the possession scenes, but I don't think they realize that the victims are not being possessed by a demon, but by Professor Kapp which is why they are not made to look more demonic. So, that's what the film doesn't have. What it does have, however, is a sense of humor, but since I'm reviewing it I suppose you've already guessed as much. Some of the humor is situational, some of it is character related, a lot of it is adolescent at best, but most of it should give you a laugh. I know I thought it was funny. But then I laughed at STREET TRASH.

What may surprise you are the characters in this flick, all of whom start out as the usual horror film stereotypes. Now I'm not saying that what we have here is a great cinematic study of the nature of personality development in college students. I'm simply saying that we get to learn a little bit more about some of them that we might normally learn in the average hack and slash, and that some of them change in unexpected ways. But toss all of that away and just have some fun, because the photography is more than adequate, the lighting enables you to see what you need to see, the girls costumes allow you to find them even when they are in very dark places, and the cast is likeable. Given my prejudices, I can't say enough about Parry Shen. I'd like to be able to see him in more serious roles of course, but being Asian, you're often lucky if you can even land a role in horror flick. And Brad Dourif is always a joy. No one past or present can chew scenery the way this man can!

In short, there's no reason not to give this film a try.",1223424000,5,6541,4.560851063829787
2102856,4,B0002LE9FO,"THE HAZING concerns a college frat / sorority combined hazing of a group of pledges. Said pledges must collect various items like a movie-theatre seat, frizbee, mannequin, ...and oh yeah, an ancient book of pure eeeevil! This book is in the possession of professor Kapps (Brad Dourif) as part of his plan to attain immortality, ultimate power, and world domination. The pledges split into two groups, one being led by Marsha (Tiffany Shepis from Abominible, and Delta Delta Die!) breaks into Kapps' house to steal the book. This is where the fun begins!

2102857,4,B0002LE9FO,"I saw this movie originally when it first came out, just because Brad Dourif was in it. And while this wasn't one of his better movies, it was still worth watching. One of my favorite scenes was when one of the pledges was down in the basement to get the spellbook that was thrown. He encounters Professor Kapps' spirit (played by Brad), and Kapps gives him a good tongue thrashing. Implying that the guy can't even read English. Brad even does a pretty good British accent.

This movie is somewhat like ""Night of the Demons"", but it manages not to be as...boring. If for nothing else, the humor alone holds the movie together.",1184976000,,627,4.548672566371682

The movie was all around entertaining and that's what i watch movies for.

2102860,4,B0002LE9FO,"An evil sorcerer (actually a college professor) and a fraternity/sorority hazing collide in this interesting and campy horror film.  The pledges go on a Halloween scavenger hunt and then are to return to a haunted mansion.  One of the items on the list is a book owned by a professor.  Of course the professor is evil and the book contains real spells.  But when the professor is almost killed accidentally additional forces are brought into play.  The professor's spirit enters one of the pledges after a gateway to Hell is opened.

It soon becomes obvious to the pledges and the hidden frat members that things are not going as originally planned.  Things start to get real bad real fast.  Soon there are only a handful left alive and they must rally their forces to try and stop the evil professor and his plans for domination.  Plenty of campy action ensues until the final scene.

This was better than I expected.  Academy Award winner Brad Dourif plays the evil professor.  A fairly competent cast of young actors make up the rest of the characters.  This is a fairly campy film with plenty of gore and a touch of humor.  The special effects are pretty good and match the camp feel of things.  I have to say that I wasn't sure how this one was going to end and there are some surprises in store.

2102863,4,B0002LE9FO,"This surprisingly good low-budget Rolfe Kanefsky horror film is generally predictable but still manages 87 minutes of great fun and entertainment. I don't understand any of the negative comments as ""The Hazing"" would serve nicely as a ""good"" example for film students looking to get the maximum effect out of a tiny budget while avoiding the pitfalls of similar examples of the horror genre.

Taking much of its premise from ""The Evil Dead"" (including some actual references to Bruce Campbell), ""The Hazing"" slightly amps up ""Evil Deads"" subtle self-parodying style. Which means a slight increase in fun/humor and a slight decrease in suspense/horror. Not that there is anything wrong with that as Kanefsky manages this trade-off to the advantage of his more relaxed film. It should also appeal to fans of ""Night of the Demons"" and both versions of ""The House on Haunted Hill"".

The story involves the standard overage group of fraternity and sorority pledges forced to spend the night in a haunted house. Fortunately the atmospheric low lighting serves to generally hide the physical casting age issue.

A hint to the many clueless directors and cinematographers out there: note how Kanefsky recognized the damage that low lighting can do to his sexploitation elements. He has the female leads dress in a tight silver super-heroine costume and a white Playboy bunny outfit, which are thankfully visible even when the characters are standing in the shadows.

Brad Dourif (Billy from ""One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest"") does a convincing job as one of their professors, a nut case who seeks to open the gates of hell. Nector Rose (Delia) gives a nice performance as a not-quite-the airhead-she-seems blonde sorority chick. Tiffany Shepis (Marsha) fills out the super-heroine costume quite nicely and appears to be having a lot of fun as a character who must alternate between being normal and being possessed by the professor. The rest of the cast is serviceable in undemanding roles.

Make-up and effects are not elaborate but are quite effective. Technical elements (production design, cinematography, and editing) are all first rate.

The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that.

Forget the plot---we've been there before so there aren't any real surprises.  There is some great humor, though, including some wonderful one liners, one of the heroes use of expletives during the bashing of Brad Dourif, and a bimbo blonde who isn't so bimbo.  Then you have the tongue from hell, and some glorious decapitations.  Dourif adopts an English accent (sometimes) and chews up the scenery like a reincarnation of the late great Vincent Price; the girls are busty and bodacious, and the studs studly and stupid.  Credit to Parry Shen for having the guts to give such a bad performance that it's good.

What was scary was his interpretation of the movie and recalling the certain elements.  Eventually, after describing the movie to many different people in order to finally get them to come, it went from a bad movie to a gloriously over the top movie.  I'm sorry, it's just a terrible movie.  That's all I can say.  One of the worst excuses to make a film in the history of film.  Really bad plot and everything.

2102869,4,B0002LE9FO,"A very surprising B horror film. The acting is cheesy, the FX's are cheesy. However, the movie tries to follow in the foot steps of evil dead, as well as other past classic horror comedies. It even has several tributes to Bruce Campbell in the movie (they thank Bruce in the credits, so I'm not sure how much involvement he had in this movie). Anyway, despite its generic aspects, the movie does manage to have some good gore, and some pretty good laughs. I was already partial to the movie when I found out it took place in a Halloween type atmosphere, where the victims where in costumes, in an old house. Very good movie, but I had a few problems with it. I rented it. I remember getting more than half way through this movie and thinking ""wow, I might actually have to buy this movie, its awesome..."" But then it starts to sag towards the end. The jokes start to lose their luster, and the gore is soon replaced with a cheesy attempt at a story line. However, that's not one of my biggest 2 complaints: spoiler warning********* 1) By the movie cover picture, you are under the assumption that the main character will pick up the chainsaw , grow a pair, and fight the forces of evil (like ash did in evil dead). This never happens. We could have had one good old bloody slaughter fest to end this one, but they did not develop the blonde's character to its full gut-ripping potential. Big let down on that. 2) the ending was terrible, which I will not give away, although I am a firm believe that Hollywood has lost that ability to write good endings to horror movies, based on the last 20 recent horror films I have seen...

2102870,1,B0002LE9FO,"I saw this film and realized somebody had read the script and thought ""Hey, this would make a good movie!"" But thats impossible. The producers had to need a tax write off or something, they certainly weren't hoping to make any money from this thing. The acting is OK (just), the effects are so-so, but the writing just isn't there. Its terrible. Its obvious they were trying to be campy and it just came off cheesy and shoddy. If you absolutely must see it, buy it used (theres lots of them for sale, that should tell you something) and resell it immediately. You don't want this thing on your shelf....",1105833600,,603,4.490909090909091
2102871,4,B0002LE9FO,"I rented this film expecting it to be a B movie, and was not disappointed.  It's a dumb, cheesy movie, and made a cold Sunday night much more fun.

The general plot is no big surprise.  There is a book that contains the incantations that will cause a portal to ""the other side"".  Brad Douriff plays the crazed professor who owns the book. He has been waiting for years for the right time to read the incantation and have someone kill him (!) so he can cross over.  Enter a bunch of frat/sorority pledges on a scavenger hunt, who mortally wound the professor while trying to get the book.  After their hunt is over, they have to spend the night at a haunted house.  They leave the dying professor behind (they are at least decent enough to dial 911 for him), and head over to spook central with the book.  Once there, the expected hell breaks loose.

A saving grace to the movie is that the characters are not actually the stereotypes they initially appear to be.

Is this the most original movie ever made?  No.

Is it great cinema?  Hell, no.

What it is is funny and weird, with a little mild scariness.  Watch this with a tub of popcorn and suspend all higher brain functions.",1102896000,5,1179,4.368663594470046

8028843,4,B0002LE9FO,"This is a fun movie, as opposed to a good one, but a couple of traits set it apart from standard fare and make it worthwhile if you lower your expectations.
Although the plot is very conventional overall, it breaks from the cliches just enough to make it fresh. Characters don't -quite- fit the stereotypes you expect, the survivors aren't -quite- whom you think they will be.
The humor is quirky, and well spread enough to lighten the mood at just the right moments.
And, low budget as it is, some of the makeup is honestly quite effective in an understated kind of way.
If you enjoy Night of The Creeps, Night of The Demons, and the like, this is actually a great little sleeper of a movie, tons better then I expected.",1362096000,,721,4.428571428571429
8028844,4,B0002LE9FO,"Watching The Hazing (also known as Dead Scared), I kept thinking how unfortunate it was that the film kept resorting to stupid horror comedy shenanigans - that is, until I realized that this basically was a horror comedy.  So, basically, what we have here is a horror comedy that actually had some potential to be a decent horror flick.  The movie's official web site describes it as ""The Evil Dead meets Scream,"" but that is pure hype.  While enjoyable, The Hazing lacks the intelligence and unique appeal of a true cult classic.  Comedy is one thing, but this film has moments of utter silliness that take away from an otherwise entertaining viewing experience.  Of course, if The Hazing had given me more than a short but stimulating cameo from Brooke Burke, all sins might have been forgiven.

So it's Halloween, the perfect night for the hazing of wannabe frat boys and sorority girls.  The final task of our three guys and two girls is to collect all manner of items in a scavenger hunt, bring their stolen possessions to the town's very own haunted house, and get through the night without leaving.  Naturally, pranksters will already be there preparing all sorts of thrills and spills, but that goes without saying.  It turns out they needn't have bothered, as this party will be crashed by a supernatural uninvited guest.  Doug (Phillip Andrew) and Marsha (Tiffany Shepis) take it upon themselves to abscond with the scavenger hunt's most valuable item, a Necronomicon-type tome in the possession of weird Professor Kapps (Brad Dourif).  Things don't go quite as planned, and the end result is that our gang of crazy college kids ultimately find themselves trapped inside a haunted house with an evil human spirit trying to torture and kill them as part of his bid to conquer death and gain unlimited powers.

Naturally, these being crazy college kids and all, there is some nudity and sexually oriented humor.  What you will not find are any scares or frightening moments whatsoever, which I find to be unfortunate.  Even the couple of gorier moments aren't that effective because you can't take them seriously.  On the plus side, there was a little bit of effort made to diverge from the seemingly stereotypical characterization of the ""bimbo"" (Nectar Rose) and the ""nerd"" (Parry Shen).  The acting itself is surprisingly good and the special effects rather impressive for the most part, given the low-budget nature of the whole production.  The end result is a surprisingly enjoyable little horror comedy that could run circles around a few of the more prominent films in the genre.  It's sort of hard not to have fun watching this.",1332806400,,2644,4.890134529147982

this horror movie is a comedic take on the genre and has as many laughs as frights.  I found it was more effective as a comedy than as a straight-forward horror movie.

8028846,5,B0002LE9FO,"i am a huge fan of tiffany shepis, and it is movies like this, are the reason why, in the movie, it is about college kids the girls want to join the sorority, and the guys the big fraterity, to do this they must get a certain ammount of points, and are set out on a scavenger hunt, and they must spend the night in a hunted house, well as tiffany shepis, and her partner find some items and they find a book, it belongs to a old man, who does demon spells with it, they kill him and take the book and go back to the house, when they get there, their friends are there, and so are the head of the sorority, and the fraterity, they play games on the kids, locking them inside the house, but one of the kids does a spell and it brings back to life the old man, who wants revenge and wants his book back. and he can possess bodies, and take over them and kill the other person just to get his staff and his book back, and he will stop at nothing to get it.
  ok, what i love about this movie is, it is funny and campy, and it is scary, some of the scares are really good, and the laughs are better then the hollywood comedies they put out, and the effects are goofy but good for a small budget movie, the director really made the best out of what he had to use, and he put in some decent effects, and scares, oh and look for a small role for brook burke, at the beginning, it is good to see her again.
  but, the real star is tiffany shepis, she is cute and sassy in the movie, and gives it some of it's biggest laughs, she has a real screen presense, and is so sweet, and when she wants be really sassy, and has great comedic timing also, she is very under appreciated. she deserves more respect, i know this is a campy movie, but that is the point, they are not trying to out do citizen kane, they are making a cute, goofy, and a little scary movie, so please do not knock it for being campy for pete sake. just sit back and enjoy, if it was a movie like transformers that is different, this is low budget, and the people who make movies like this are just trying to have some fun, so enjoy this wonderful fun movie, that will make you feel good and actually give you a few good scares, and a lot of good laughs, give it a chance, you might be surprised, it is a huge cult favorite and i see why... this is what good campy fun is all about, so for those of you tired of what hollywood is doing, well independent movies are the answer, go ahead you might like what you see",1301788800,,2469,3.971774193548387
8028847,2,B0002LE9FO,"The Hazing (Rolfe Kanefsky, 2004)

What do you do when you want to make a quick buck? Simple: mash together a few supernatural flicks, stick your name on it, assemble a cast of scream queens, and release it as The Hazing. At least, that's what you do if you're Rolfe Kanefsky, the genius behind (some of) the Emmanuelle 2000 flicks and Nightmare Man.

Brad Dourif, who's a fine actor when he gets a decent part, plays Kapps, a professor of the occult who is obsessed with the idea of opening a portal to hell. Pursuant to that end, he slaughters a lovely young co-ed angling for a good grade. (I assume she got an A for her participation.) A while later, the house has gained a reputation as haunted, and a fraternity and a sorority join forces and send their pledges to spend Halloween night in the house. Needless to say, that gate is still open...

I'm not sure there's a single original thought to be found in this movie. The acting is about as good as one would expect given that three of the lead roles are filled by scream queens (Brooke Burke, Tiffany Shepis, and Nectar Rose); it's fun, but not deathless cinema by any means. If you're willing to turn your rain off and have a good time with it, it's not all that bad. If you're looking for original, intelligent horror fare, however, look elsewhere. **",1259539200,,1312,4.458333333333333
