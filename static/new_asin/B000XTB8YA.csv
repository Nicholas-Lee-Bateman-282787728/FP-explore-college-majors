4710662,5,B000XTB8YA,"This isn't the best high quality film, but it is a funny romance. The characters are unique and easy to fall in love with. Its not a sappy romance or a sex driven movie, but about moving on after a love one has passed away.",1394150400,2,223,3.977777777777778
4710663,2,B000XTB8YA,"This movie, in my opinion is a goofy movie. The story line sucks as well as the acting. Sorry, but that is the way I feel. I try to tell it like it is.",1393891200,,151,3.4705882352941178

4710666,5,B000XTB8YA,"What a great movie!
Hilarious in parts, yet sad, just like life....
Very unique story line with an surprise ending. Takeshi Kaneshiro and Kelly shine in their performances.
Some very good messages in the story, too",1367366400,4,214,4.972222222222222
4710667,5,B000XTB8YA,"I rented this movie from our public library, and it was easily the most emotional movie I have ever seen in my life. Takeshi Kaneshiro and Kelly Chen were fantastic in this movie. This is one I go to watch again and again. It is VERY well worth your money. I cried buckets after seeing this, and I do every time.",1291420800,9,312,4.131147540983607

4710670,5,B000XTB8YA,"111 minutes Fantasy dream romance Cantonese, English subtitled.

4710674,5,B000XTB8YA,"I love it so much that I will invite friends to my house to watch it.  I'll have a potluck dinner after church on Sunday. Not this one, but, next maybe. I need to buy it first, because in my TV the written part is seeing only part of it.

I like the purity, the simplicity, and the humor of this movie LAVENDER.",1437523200,,311,3.9206349206349205
4710675,4,B000XTB8YA,"4.5 stars. This is one most people will either love or hate. I really had no idea what it was about but watched because Takeshi Kaneshiro, my favorite male Asian actor was in it (watch Red Cliff for his most remarkable performance). If you like more metaphysical type themes you will probably like this, and Asian films of this type are far better than any American made films of the same genre.",1437264000,2,395,4.5

4710678,3,B000XTB8YA,"Runtime posted is wrong - it is 1:40-ish, not 52 min.

As a view into how a different culture might see ""angels"" in a more literal way than in western cultures, it is slightly interesting.  I found myself trying to recall where on the mid-level escalators she was. Definitely know exactly where the homeless guy was sitting.

The leading actress is absolutely beautiful, so the movie has that going for it.  She's working through the death of a former boyfriend. That is resolved in an odd way.  No romance. Slight action in the beginning. Only a slight amount of comedy. Not too serious.  Not sure who this movie is for.

""Buy me dinner, all is forgiven.""

Watch once. Don't buy.",1429056000,,680,4.608333333333333
4710679,3,B000XTB8YA,"If you want a kinda cute romance with some supernatural elements that doesn't require any heavy thinking, this movie is for you. It's billed as a comedy romance, but it has comedic elements without being really funny. The leads are attractive, the story predictable (in a good way) and unlike a lot of these movies, Lavender does have a happyish ending. I've seen it; I don't feel any need to see it again.",1427587200,,406,4.575342465753424

4710681,3,B000XTB8YA,This may have been made for a younger audience. It was lacking heart in my opinion and had some juvenile humor.,1425945600,,111,4.333333333333333

4710686,4,B000XTB8YA,Silly but entertaining.  The 52 min. run time is incorrect.  It's more like an hour and a half.,1413676800,,95,4.222222222222222
4710687,5,B000XTB8YA,"I read the other reviews and decided to try this one. It starts off strange but it gets better and better. I love the ending.
It is a romantic story with a twist and special. You need to be opened minded for this movie too....Enjoy it.",1396656000,,235,4.130434782608695

8475229,2,B000XTB8YA,"I really like fantasy, but this movie was just silly, at times over the top and a bit vapid.  Also, the editing was horrible; there would be a scene playing and then all of a sudden the movie would cut to another scene without any transition.  The only positive I can add is that the lead characters were appealing, but that's the only favorable thing I can say about this.",1498003200,,373,4.314285714285714
8475230,5,B000XTB8YA,"I clicked on a random movie in the Fantasy category, just trying out Amazon Prime. Didn't expect I'd even watch the whole thing, let alone fall in love with it! This movie is sweet and emotional and silly and beautiful. I was charmed by the two leads and surprised by the gentle handling of sensitive subjects, like the gay neighbor, and grief. The humor took me back to the days when I was collecting early Jackie Chan videos, also made by Golden Harvest. All in all I'd have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. <3",1496620800,,519,4.416666666666667
