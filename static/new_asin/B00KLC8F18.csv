8659677,4,B00KLC8F18,"""Planes 2"" is a very good movie - just not up to Pixar Studios' usual excellence.  The subject (fire fighting), the supporting characters, and the humor are all top-notch.  The screenplay is professionally written - but just plain predictable.  Still RECOMMENDED.",1485043200,,263,5.365853658536586
