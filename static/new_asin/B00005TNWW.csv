1661680,2,B00005TNWW,"This workout was truly a waste of money.  The two instructors are annoying and way too chatty for my taste.  All the men in the workout are shirtless which I found distracting and not in a good way.  Yes, it's an ab workout but I don't need to see them constantly and Mr. Cole is a little on the skinny side.  There is no rhyme or reason to the workout and it is not focused at all.  They start off with martial arts drills and the instructor kept referring to kicks when he was just lifting his knee.  To me, a kick requires an extension of the entire leg but maybe they know something I don't. They moved on to ""cardio"" which was pretty much a lot of side steps.  If you're in reasonable shape, it's not going to get your heart rate up.  The structured tai chi movements looked interesting but the instructor then starts to flay his arms wildly in the air encouraging you to go with the flow and do what you feel like doing with your arms.  I finally gave up when they got to the move where you lay on the floor on your back and scurry around like a bug trying to follow your partner as he/she shuffles from side to side.  I hate silly workouts! I gave it a 2 because if you can get past the annoying instructors and some of the silly moves, the workout has some decent moves that really could benefit the abs.",1184198400,7,1312,4.1299212598425195
1661681,5,B00005TNWW,"I have been involved in fitness for over 20 years and am always looking for  unique workout methods. This video redefines core conditioning. There are exercises and drills that I've never even seen before. The video incorporates martial arts drills, cardio interval training, plyometric training, yoga poses, gymnastic strength and flexibility exercises. It is broken into seven sections: Intro, Core Education, Standing Drills, Cardio Core, Partnered Drills, Floor Core and Cool Down Stretch. There is also an excellent bonus section called Party Pump.  Party Pump is a really cool five minute fast workout if you want to feel great before going out socially. I highly recommend this video to anyone who is serious about their conditioning and wants to add an extraordinary video to their collection.",1173139200,10,801,5.349206349206349
1661682,3,B00005TNWW,"I consider this tape a very good routine breaker, something that you could do a Saturday or Sunday, just for that... breaks the routine.
There are some sections that you can perform by yourself, but it would more fun if you had a partner.
I recommend it!",1023062400,2,254,4.425531914893617
7953711,2,B00005TNWW,"I am generally speaking a Scott Cole fan, his intro to Tai Chi products are excellent. I just couldn't get into this work out.",1409961600,,126,4.291666666666667
7953712,3,B00005TNWW,"decent instruction, intense, yet not overwhelming. I think this is a great beginner DVD and it served its purpose for me",1375660800,,120,4.761904761904762
7953713,2,B00005TNWW,"This video has to be 30 years old, it looks like a cheap 80's exercise video. I started watching it and after 20 minutes they still hadnt done a single ab exercise.",1362873600,,164,4.15625
7953714,5,B00005TNWW,"Got for my 18 yr. old skinny son & he loved it.  Great work out, not some girls shaking their booties in his face, just a work out for guys.",1325030400,,140,3.6666666666666665
7953715,4,B00005TNWW,I enjoy this dvd very much because of the ways to do abs I have never done before. It is great to have new ideas!,1319414400,2,113,3.56
7953716,4,B00005TNWW,"This is Scott Cole (aerobics & Tai Chi dvds) & Tom Seabourne (Ph. D. exercise science,Taekwondo & Karate) w/3 women & 1 male backup in red/black workout clothes.
This is basic toning & cardio with some martial arts footwork, plyometrics, yoga, basic gymnastics strength/flexibility, basic step touch style cardio, standing/floor toning. Some of it has partner work, but you can do it w/o by imagining the person.
It has a bonus 5 min ""Party Pump"" which is Scott alone outside doing a 5 min fast workout to do when you're short on time that involves standing/floor toning to work the whole body.

I liked that this isn't basics aerobics & toning, but has a martial arts, mind/body connection, though there could have been more instruction on the martial arts portion & the tai chi hands had none. The partner floor defense ab work was fun as well as some other parts were & wish they made another with more instruction. The banter from Scott & Tom seemed honest, unforced & amusing which is refreshing from the usual over-scripted most dvds have.

This has not been changed since the VHS version, even contains the beginning text prompts from the VHS. I believe this was also called originally ""Crunch Free Abs"" VHS.

7953717,5,B00005TNWW,I got this DVD for him because even thought he works out 5 days a week it has been impossible for him to get nice abs... Thanks to Scott Cole he looks amazing.,1246838400,4,159,3.8484848484848486
7953718,5,B00005TNWW,The DVD is informative and gives different AB workouts other than crunches. Thank you for the promt service. I received it quickly and in perfect condition.,1243209600,2,156,5.038461538461538
7953719,4,B00005TNWW,"While I think Scott Cole is a great instructor, I am giving this DVD 3 stars because it is just a remake/rename of the previous No Crunch Abs workout that was produced on video.  That aside, I still think it is a great workout.  I wished that the cardio section was a little longer.  The non-cardio portion was a little confusing at first - I could not figure the point of the exercises, but the rest, to me, was pretty good.  I look forward to using some of his other programs.",1231891200,3,478,4.21978021978022
7953720,5,B00005TNWW,"I think it's good to have an open mind about this DVD.  It's pretty good, and not the cookie-cutter kind of DVD.  I like the way it incorporates tai chi and even boxing moves into the routine.  And the extra five-minute workout at the end is icing on the cake.  I have been doing the cardio section (9-minutes long) 3 times per session, for a perfect 27-minute low-impact cardio-interval workout, and it has allowed me to slim down in a fairly short period of time.",1212105600,5,465,4.435294117647059
