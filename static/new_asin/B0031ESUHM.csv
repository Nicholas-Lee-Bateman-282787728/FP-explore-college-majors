8386971,1,B0031ESUHM,"First of all, I received the package 2 days ago. It came in a yellow envelope. I opened the envelope and the DVD case was damaged during shipment, because the seller didn't ship it in a box. NEVER ship DVDs or CD's in an envelope!!

I put the dvd in my dvd player and it immediately started to play. There was no menu, it just played. The start of the movie showed a man and a woman (hippies) holding hands and walked up to a cliff. They stood infront of one another, held hands above their heads and formed a ""london bridge"" with one another. I thought this was really dorky. After that they cut scene and went to the couple sitting in a mock studio. It was then that I realized how horrible this DVD actually is.

The movie was filmed back in the early 90's, using a very old camcorder. The video quality was horrid!! The couple started out talking about what they do, which is that they host a spiritual show, must be on some kind of spiritual PBS network or something.

The lady opened up with a meditational prayer, which was not what I would call meditation.

After this, they introduced the most horrid singer/guitar player I have ever seen or heard. They allowed her to play a song which was very screechy. I had to fast forward thru this, I couldn't stand it!

They introduced a man, Tony Stubbs, (I've never heard of him) and spoke about his book. As Tony was speaking, the microphone had a MAJOR issue and you couldn't hear anything he was saying. They realized they had a ""sound problem"" and cut back to the 18 year old singer and had her play another disgusting song. After she was done, they admitted they had a sound issue as the show was ""recorded live"". What?? And this was made into a DVD??? Horrible and unprofessional!!

They continued speaking to Tony, asking him a couple questions, in which he mentioned ""Seth Speaks"" as well as how he was intruduced to the world of metaphysics, as well as his career working in Computer Science.

Well, after about 15 minutes or so of this blabber, the ""movie"" ended.

????????????????????

What the heck kind of a movie was this?? It was supposed to be a DVD about channeling. I don't even think the word ""channeling"" was ever mentioned in this movie!

In the description of this movie according to Amazon, it states ""DVD Release Date: December 21, 2009"" This was very deceiving!! With the awesome graphic on the cover as well as the ""2009"" date, it made you believe this was a 2009 movie. It is NOT a 2009 movie. It was filmed back in 1991 or 1992. Horrible!!!

I think a 12 year old could have made a better film with a camera phone.

Needless to say, I sent it back yesterday, in a yellow envelope. =)",1280361600,2,2663,4.390243902439025
