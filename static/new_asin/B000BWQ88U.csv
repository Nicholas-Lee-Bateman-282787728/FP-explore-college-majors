8093566,4,B000BWQ88U,"I received the product in a very timely manner. The video was only available in VHS format which obviously dates it and the production quality of the times in which it was produced. The quality was as listed and the video played fine. I only needed it to play once in order to transfer the content to a more user-friendly digital medium for current technological devices (competer, iPod, iPad, etc...,) Would have liked for the video to be longer but it was an interesting documentary of behind the scenes with Take 6. Especially enjoyed the section where they broke down a song and showed how the parts, adding them one by one mesh together to form the song.",1353369600,,659,4.593220338983051
