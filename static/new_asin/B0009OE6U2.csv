The absolute best version you can find of this release.'ebay has a better price on it. DVD in STEREO",1436486400,,126,4.08
8064130,4,B0009OE6U2,Classic Asia concert without John Wetton (Let go or quit shortly before) although Greg Lake (ELP) does a descent job as a replacement. I remember watching this show on MTV via satellite then later purchasing the VHS tape. Great show be nice to see a transfer of this on to DVD sometime soon,1422489600,,290,4.490566037735849
8064131,4,B0009OE6U2,"The cover lists TIME AGAIN, which was the opening song that night, but it's not included at all. I watched this concert live in 1983, and remembered the performance of TIME AGAIN being pretty loose. Finding it on youtube recently confirmed my memory 100%. ASIA in this line-up could have been one of the greatest prog-rock bands ever; unfortunately they only played two shows and Greg Lake hit the bricks. Lake was using a teleprompter most of the night; find it strange that a pro like him couldn't memorize the lyrics. However, ASIA still has a soft spot in my heart, and I was so looking forward to Lake taking them to a new level. Glad I have this as a souvenir.",1308787200,,666,4.467213114754099
