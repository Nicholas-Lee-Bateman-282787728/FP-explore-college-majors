Not a bad price for a few horror movies. I have already seen Children of the Corn 666, which is one of the better sequels. Of course Dust Devil is the edited version instead of the hard-to-find director's cut, but I'm still looking forward to watching the movie. I have heard of El Muerto (The Dead One), but I have never seen it. As for the other two movies, I have never heard of them before.
