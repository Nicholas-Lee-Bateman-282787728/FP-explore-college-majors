Our story line and plot, Our heroes Stony Brooke (Robert Livingston), Tucson Smith (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) members of the Three Mesquiteers are up to their eyeballs in water --- The story has the 'Mesquiteers' running across a new town that is being built to help out some settlers who have been displaced by a flood. The trio start to suspect that something might not be what it seems, so they stick around to look into things, and the action proceeds from there, with some occasional humor (much of it from Max Terhune) --- Flagg (Kenneth Harlan) is relocating flood victims to Gunsmoke Ranch --- The Three Mesquiteers know Flagg to be a crook and try to warn them --- They ignore the warning and improve the land only to find that it has been condemned for a new dam --- Actual newsreel footage of the previous years' floods adds a veneer of credibility to Gunsmoke Ranch.

2699358,5,B0007UNUNC,"Forumal westerns always seem to work well and I wish they would make more of them. This one is particualarly exciting becuase it seems like the odds are stacked against the townsfolk until the heros ride into town to save them. It remiinded me a bit of Unforgiven, but has more vintage texture to it than the modern film. The messsage fo all of these films is that sometimes violence is needed to get rid of bad people - as an obvious metaphor for the comming war in Europe.",1148256000,,474,4.337078651685394

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezeweed.

In GUNSMOKE RANCH, the operator of a crooked land syndicate lures homesteaders to a flood zone by offering them ""no money down"" terms. The Mesquiteers uncover a scheme that will leave these settlers both homeless and broke.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.
