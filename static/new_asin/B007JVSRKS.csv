5091833,4,B007JVSRKS,"I'd like to provide a review but I can't because my US player will not play PAL formatted disks.  There appears to be no NTSC version available.  I know that the list of features says that the disk is in the PAL format, but I wasn't paying attention.  The product description (which I read) does not mention the formatting issue.  The cost of returning the disk is about $4.  Amazon  should not sell this product to US customers without first verifying that the buyer wishes to buy a product that is intended to be played in a country with 50HZ electricity.  The fact that this is a PAL disk should be displayed in LARGE BOLD RED characters so it is difficult to miss.

Four months later, and I've solved the problem.  I bought a ($70) universal player with NTSC output, and despite warnings of difficulties associated with ""hacking"" the unit, this PAL disk played perfectly.

Each sonnet is its own track, and there are 150+ of them.  Getting back to any one particular sonnet is not easy.

As for the performances, most are very well done.  I'm is the slower-is-better category because thinking about what is being said is so much a part of enjoying this body of work.  Some were recited too quickly for my taste.  Some were flawless (though I can't be considered an expert).  I found it too much to listen to the whole disk in one sitting.  I will be watching these many times in the future.  I don't have a problem with the low level of animation associated with each performance.  The reason for playing this DVD is to absorb the words and for that intonation and phrasing are key elements.  The visuals are entirely secondary.  I did notice the occasional difference between the spoken text and the printed text I was following along with.",1371340800,10,1745,4.564516129032258
5091834,5,B007JVSRKS,"You have the wrong DVD displayed. What you have is Simon Callow's on-man show, not the sonnets. Aside from that oversight, I must say The Sonnets DVD is superb. So many different readings , and so wonderful each in its own way. Except for the non-actors(Professors, poets ), who are uniformly dreadful,the quality is extremely high. Some better than others of course. I found Patrick Stewart a little disappointing, he reads in a very general way. But Kate Fleetwood, Polly Frame,Nonzo Anosie,Ruth Negga,and Fiona Shaw especially wonderful Best of all, in my opinion, is Simon Callow.",1354838400,17,584,5.09375
5091835,5,B007JVSRKS,"I must admit this was the best reading of Shakespeare's Sonnets I've ever heard.  And it's all because of the voices.  The oratory skills of these actors, including Patrick Stewart, is phenomenal.  If you like the sonnets, this is a must have!!!",1347840000,22,245,4.785714285714286
8518490,2,B007JVSRKS,I schedule my vacations to fit when the RSC is performing. I watch plays on the screen here in the US when available. The problem here is that this dvd is not available to play in the US. I have it in my desk until the next trip to the UK. Please issue it again for the US.,1467072000,,273,3.7241379310344827

8518495,1,B007JVSRKS,"This DVD will NOT play on U.S. DVD players. It is a Region 2 format, which I didn't see anywhere in the product description or list of features. This is unfortunate because I'd heard great things about ""Being Shakespeare"" and really wanted to have it in my collection. So I was very disappointed when it arrived, and my DVD player couldn't read it.",1423440000,,348,4.5396825396825395
8518496,5,B007JVSRKS,"I am partial to Simon Callow, but that aside, he portrays this imaginative one-man show with passion and conviction. I learned much about W.S. that I didn't know, and the script is, of course laced with Shakespeare's poetry. Please be aware that this is a recording of a live stage production, so if you dislike that sort of thing you might think twice. Also, this disc is region 2, so you might have to watch it on your computer.",1422835200,,430,4.455696202531645
8518497,4,B007JVSRKS,While Shakespeare is not my favorite subject I still have to teach the subject to my students having mild-to-moderate disabilities.  Using movies such as this one helps my students to see and hear Shakespeare in the light that it was intended to be seen and heard.  To have my high school students reading at a 2nd-5th grade level read Shakespeare would have been complete torture!,1385856000,,381,4.846153846153846
8518498,5,B007JVSRKS,Hearing the sonnets read by this stellar array of actors breathes new life into some of the most revered poems in the English language.,1380758400,5,135,4.666666666666667
8518499,4,B007JVSRKS,"Top notch actors perform Shakespeare's sonnets in this DVD. The picture and sound is very good, the words are beautiful, and the cast is absolutely stellar.  There is no music, there are no costumes, and there are no sets.  Just the actors, in modern dress, against plain backdrops, and the words.

Two things bothered me-
Every sonnet is a ""talking head"" recitation.  The actor is in a head-and-shoulders to the camera view, and stares straight forward towards the camera.  While perhaps the intention was to make the experience more intimate, to me, it feels unnatural, and takes away from the emotion of the sonnet.  I can't imagine any lovestruck poet sitting *so perfectly still* while confessing the deepest feelings of his (or her) heart.  The format reminded me of a news anchor reading the news off of a teleprompter.

Given the talent that these wonderful actors have, it seemed to me they were held back by not being able to move, turn their head, look up, down, or use their hands as they spoke.  For example, if you've seen David Tennant and Patrick Stewart's brilliant and dynamic turn in Hamlet-you may be disappointed that both of them recite their sonnets barely moving, as are all of the actors, almost frozen in place.  Their voices are wonderful, but the format really seems to restrain the movement of the actors, which deadens the words somewhat, and the sonnets run together, indistinguishable.

Also-some of the actors seem to have been reading off-camera, perhaps a cue card, or a teleprompter (like the news anchor), couldn't be sure they were off-book.  This probably wouldn't have been noticeable except that the actors are *sitting so still,* and because their heads are not moving even moving a little, I really noticed the eyes moving, and it was distracting.

Overall, it's a very good production of some beautiful writing by very talented actors.  However, I would have loved those actors to have had more physical freedom to express the intense emotions of the words.  They do very well with their voices alone, but the format does not lend itself to emotional expression.",1372809600,5,2106,4.909604519774011
