1991595,5,B0001DMUCM,"The story of a Scotish family, their trials and tribulations and how each member deals with their lot.  Excellent cast headed by Susan Hampshire & Richard Briers and many other wonderful actors. Beautiful scenery, very enlightening if you have a limited knowledge of Scotish folklore. I look forward to the next DVDs of seasons 4, 5 and 6.  Recommend it highly if you like to follow a continuing developing story.",1126310400,,413,4.885714285714286
1991596,5,B0001DMUCM,"Monarch is filled with the best cast of characters you will find on any show. In season 2 Archie is fully charged with his new position as Laird and is doing everything he can for the estate to make money. Even his father Hector, ever the hindrance, has actually tried to help from time to time. The 'will they or won't they' romance between Archie and Katrina was getting tiresome but by the end of season 2 they seemed to have settled in.

Season 2 of Monarch of the Glen continues the high quality of the first. When you sit down to watch just one episode you wind up watching 4 because you can't help but want to know what happens next. When you've watched them all, you need to buy the next series.",1122076800,,703,4.246268656716418
1991597,5,B0001DMUCM,"As my friends Megan and J.Hassler state...

Monarch of the Glen is a wonderfully witty comedy for the whole family. The Scottish Highlands are beautiful, but it's the characters which carry this show breathtakingly! I am finally able to order both Series 1 and 2 and looking forward to seeing these Series again and again.  I wish you would talk to BBC Video and release the other three series to us eager USA/Canada Boglies! Please! If you haven't bought these DVDs or videos--it's a must! :)",1104451200,5,493,4.72093023255814
1991598,5,B0001DMUCM,"Ugh, such a wait we've had to endure to get the first two series of this fantastic show on DVD... However, undecided reader that I assume you are, did you notice that ONLY Series 1 is available on VHS and the DVD versions of the show stops at Series 2?  It's not Amazon's fault, who has done a fantastic job of supplying our show to us... No, this is because BBC Video, the US media producer of BBC programs has not released the show beyond Series 2.  However, you know from reading my dear friend Megan's review that the BBC is in the process of filming Series SIX of the show!  What's the hold up?  We don't know, to be honest.  Perhaps we need to TELL our supplier (and Amazon's supplier, who I thank heartily for selling BELOW other's prices, especially if you PRE-order) that we are getting TIRED of WAITING for them to release a season's worth of episodes that were filmed nearly FOUR YEARS AGO!

Oh, right, the actual review.... Five stars times seven..no wait, EIGHT main characters times eight episodes times four (the number of years we had to wait for this to be released) and I give this DVD of Monarch of the Glen Series 2 a grand total of one thousand, two hundred eighty stars.

However..... This is still NOT my favorite series (season) of the show.  THAT would be series 3.  Just wait until you see how many stars I give that one!  ;D",1093737600,16,1351,4.368
1991599,5,B0001DMUCM,"Monarch of the Glen is a wonderful Drama brought to us by the BBC Scotland and Ecosse Films. It has fun, lighthearted comedy, romance and whimsey. It is appropriate for all ages, races and backgrounds.

This is just the best programme on television, pure blissful escapism. The beautiful scenery and the greatest characters. Drama, romance and comedy in bucketfuls!

Monarch of the Glen is a beautiful programme which manages to combine romance, comedy and drama all before the watershed. It appeals to the whole family and the actors are all fantastic. The storylines are great, with many twists and turns but always ending like a fairytale. The amazing scenery is magical and it really takes away the dreading of monday mornings. It is shown in 44 countries and all boglies (fans of monarch) are now eagerly awaiting series six. It has 50 million viewers worldwide and after watching just one episode you'll see why.",1093478400,10,918,4.954545454545454

This dvd came wrapped in a see-thru plastic package, on which is stamped ""made in Mexico"", and the box itself reads NTSC.  I am not bothering to open it.

This is suitable for all audiences and has some truly entertaining moments. On occasion the British humor takes center stage but it all seems to work together to produce a fun evening's entertainment.

1991673,5,B0001DMUCM,"""Monarch of the Glen"" is a delightful Scottish drama with some of the best scenery, soundtrack and actors in British television. In this second season, Archie MacDonald, the reluctant laird of Glenbogle is actually pulling the sprawling estate out of debt and bringing tourism to the region. He's hired a wildlife ranger to put up nature trails so schoolchildren and others can see the estate's unspoiled forests and protect the wildlife. He's setting up an authentic Victorian croft to depict how people lived. And he's arranging to sell cottages to the long-time renters.  Hector, the old laird, is finally coming around save for the occasional lapse where whiskey is concerned. Archie's relationship with his London partner and girlfriend is over, and he believes he might have a chance with the local school-mistress.  Overall, the program's satisfying and hilarious.

The series followed the arc started from Season One.  My personal preference would have been more complications for the the endings of Archie's romances.

The addition of Fergol didn't seem to add anything except as a foil to Archie and Katrina.  I did like the final episode that ended on a cliffhanger.

The scenery of Scotland is of course a big star and trump for the series. Susan Hampshire does well not only as Archie's mother but as a complex character in her own right(see the 1st episode) The relationships, Archie's, seemed to be contrived.

This being said I will certainly watch Season 3.  The general Amazon review is not very helpful as it gives inadvertant spoilers. I wish they would remedy this",1200787200,,945,5.659574468085107

Be warned, however, that BBC America edited seasons 4 (and probably following) to add commercials (BBC in the UK is commercial free) so the Region 1 editions are EDITED.

1991680,5,B0001DMUCM,"I saw a BBC catalog with different series and movies offered.  I was intrigued by many, but of course totally unfamiliar with the product.  I tried Monarch of the Glen and was truly pleasantly surprised.  I love Scotland, having visited 4 years ago.  The characters in this series are all exceptional in my mind.  I love the scenery and the story line.  There is so much humor and love in the series.  The father and mother (Hector and Mollie) are terrific actors and portray such warm, loving, quirky characters.  Archie, the son and new Laird of Glen Bogle is intelligent, good-hearted, often confused by his women friends, and clearly frustrated in his attempts to get Glen Bogle back on its feet.  The supporting cast of Golly (groundskeeper), Duncan (who does all odd  jobs around the castle), Lexie (the cook, housekeeper, clearly in love with Archie), and Katrina, old school friend and now occasional girl friend, Justine, Archie's fiance and restaurant co-owner from London, Laird Kilwillie his parents' neighbor, friend, and sometimes foe - they are all characters you fall in love with.  Archie has his hands full and overflowing both trying to get the estate out of its debts and finding ways to make it self-sustaining, and keeping a firm hand on his father's quirky costly schemes, and his gentle mother's follies.  I love the stories, and have only seens series 1 and 2.  However I was given series 3 for Christmas and can't wait to get back into it.  I highly recommend this, and am so glad I gave it a blind stab.  I have tried a number of British offerings and am always so glad afterwards.  I personally find the films much more realistic and a joy to watch because the actors are so much more real than they are here.  Here it seems everyone cast has to be slim, extremely attractive to the extreme - only beautiful allowed, not your normal average everyday human.  I also recommend ""Oliver's Travels"" a mystery series with Alan Bates and Sinead Cusack; The Barchester Chronicles, love Alan Rickman; A House in Umbria, a mystery with beautiful scenery and Maggie Smith, Chris Cooper and Timothy Spall; and Patricia Routledge in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates.  I also highly recommend the Horatio Hornblower series and Cracker with Robbie Coltrane and an excellent cast.  Happy viewing. Jill Baxter",1167782400,6,2317,4.862244897959184

8010656,5,B0001DMUCM,"someone said that this should be the ""next big thing"" fromk the folks who brought us downton abbey - but this is a light confection, an amuse bouche in which all the threads tie up at episode's end and some of the threads are never paid off.  i liked it well enough - nothing shakespearean here, but it's fun.

lead actor looks like archie from the comics, and once you get that it's hard not to see the plots as archie-in-riverdale as well.  and there's even a jughead - which would be duncan, the arrested-development dreamer.

oh, and if space anthropologists land and this is all they find, they'll wonder how the scots ever got clans to begin with if everyone was as lunkheaded as archie and katrina... one would have to believe that they are both high in order for them to miss the cues and all the pheromones that must be hanging in the air...
