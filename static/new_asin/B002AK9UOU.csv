3884995,4,B002AK9UOU,"The ABC drama series ""Dirty Sex Money"" created by Craig Wright (""Brothers and Sisters"", ""Lost"" and ""Six Feet Under"") definitely made its impression when it took out an ad back in 2007 using Paris Hilton's jail sentence to promote its show.  The series which was originally given 22-episodes for its first season and ran into bad luck (as with other shows) due to the WGA writer's strike.  The first season only received 10 episodes and by the time the second season came back on air, it was ten months since the season finale.

Needless to say, the writer's strike definitely made ""Dirty Sexy Money"" a TV series casualty and unfortunately, the series was unable  to get back on its feet.  The remaining final episodes came back on by July 2009 but needless to say, with so many delays and its unpredictable schedule, many people were lost and eventually missed out on episodes.  But fans who committed to the series will fortunately get a chance to see ""Dirty Sexy Money - The Complete and Final Second Season"" released on DVD and give people a chance to catch up on the final season.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Dirty Sexy Money"" was a series that I really enjoyed when it first aired on television.  The first season showed promise but it was such a shame that the WGA Writer's Strike really put a damper on the series.  Not only was the series cut short but its schedule was too erratic.

By the time it came back on television for season 2, it was already ten months later.  Too much time had passed since the finale and to make things worse, when the second season did air, again the season was out of whack as the final five episodes took several months to air after it was reported that the series was canceled.  Needless to say, the series did not have much of a chance to get back on its feet.

After watching ""Dirty Sexy Money - The Complete and Final Second Season"", not only did I enjoy it, it was bittersweet because the series ends with a major bombshell and you know there are no future episodes to continue the storyline.

Overall, I feel that fans of the series can find some closure with this final DVD set and find some satisfaction from the final 13 episodes.  As mentioned, the final episode was quite intriguing and again, it's a shame that the series will not be continued.

As for the characters, I found them all quite intriguing and you eventually become drawn to that character's storyline. I was also drawn by the drama and the multiple infighting between the characters, and it's quite interesting because one can find similarities with this drama series to 80's drama series such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" which involve corporate greed, families that were born with luxury and of course, those few characters on the outside who seem to despise that lifestyle.

I felt that the trimming of the first season down to 10 episodes possibly took away from much needed character development and for the second season, although I enjoyed the series, I did have some problems with seeing the disintegration of Nick and Lisa's marriage but also seeing this somewhat unlikely storyline involving Simon Elder and Nola Lyon.  It was a bit farfetched and in someways, I just felt that the character of Simon seemed a bit too young to be the rival of Tripp Darling and therefore, for me, it hindered the storyline as these two rich corporate behemoths would go against each other.  It just didn't seem right.

I did enjoy the part of Karen Darling because her character could have been handled as the typical socialite (ie. which fits the character of Juliet Darling) but easily redeems herself as a person that wants to be love and wants to love someone.  So, it was quite interesting to see how her character started to evolve through the second season.

As for the DVD release, ""Dirty Sexy Money - The Complete and Final Second Season"" does feature solid picture quality for a drama series on DVD and for the most part, the series doesn't have poor lighting issues or heavy noise during low-light conditions that some drama series tend to have.  I felt that the set design and even the costume design was well-done for the series and capturing that style and feel of the rich Darling family and their living space.  Audio was quite clear and there are a few special features included.  Although, I do wish there was some sort of commentary track included, especially for the final episode.

Overall, fans who dedicated their time into watching ""Dirty Sexy Money"" will want to definitely check out this final second season if  you happen to miss the episodes on television.  Again, the final season will provide enough closure for the viewer but then instantly give you a feeling right at the end of the final episode of wanting more.

It's hard to recommend a TV series on DVD especially when the series has been canceled but for the most part, fans who loved the series or those who missed out on how the series ended, will find ""Dirty Sexy Money - The Complete and Final Second Season"" satisfying but at the same time, a bittersweet feeling that you want even more ""Dirty Sexy Money"", but knowing that there will be no more continuing episodes.",1251244800,37,11189,4.742871954380508
3884996,4,B002AK9UOU,"Dirty Sexy Money is certainly a hard Show to Talk about. After its tumultuous History I doub that if you were to go up to your friends and say"" Oh i was watching this wonderful show but it got a shortened season from the writers strike and then came back for a round 2 but got cancelled because of lack of viewers..""..the chance that the would be like Oh what show is very Low.....

This aside it is a Wonderful Juicy, guilty pleasure!!!
Its Allstar Cast of Donald Sutherland, Jill Clayburgh, Lucy Liu(Kill Bill), Blair Underwood(In treatment) and Peter Krause( Six feet Under) give some of there best performances i have ever seen! especially in Season 2 of this guilty pleasure in which....

--Leticia(Jill Clayburgh) is Prosecuted for the Death of Nicks father and her former lover, Dutch George
--Nick(Peter Krause) and Lisa's(Zoe Mclellan) Marriage unravels as his attraction to Karen(Natalie Zea) Grows
-- Karen Falls in love with her father Enemy Simon Elder(Blair Underwood) who has his sights on more than just Karen....
--Jeremy falls for the Nola Lions(Lucy Liu), The women who is prosecuting His mother Leticia
-- Brian has his conflicts with his sons mother
--Patrick searches desperately for the Love of his life Carmelita whilst his Wife Ellen takes action in her own hands...

Pros/Cons

Pros:
--Mr Sutherland's acting
--The cliches that are pulled off well
-- the Love triangle of Nick Lisa and Karen will have you changing sides MANY times
--The Deaths of 2 Chrachters are pulled of with enough Finesse to not be predictable
--the first 10 episodes should be the season itself
--the Soundtrack that uses the perfect music for the perfect moments..
--Craig Wrights writing is simply superb
--Episode 7 The facts( you will see :D...)

Cons:
--The Cliches that DONT work
--Sometimes William Baldwins acting is Stiff
--Jeremy and Nolas Romance made Jeremy a annoying Character
--Donald Sutherland's and Jill Clayburgh's Characters Tripp and Leticia are  pushed off to the side after episode 10 and aren't really revisited
--The departure of Samaire Armstrongs Character Juliet
-- Lucy Lius Chracter Nola Lions Becomes a broken record( My brother!!!...do we ever find out the little S**ts name!?) and really is sad for Ms Liu who is a wonderful actress
--Brians Storyline
--Episodes 11-13 are a let down..
--THE END!!!!!!...nothing is satisfying!!

Conclusion: Dirty Sexy Money Was a Really good show until the 10th episode( which was coincidentally the last episode in the television season) which afterwards becomes Cliche and unsatysfying. PERSONALLY i recommend watching the season in order EXCEPT watch episode 7 ( The Facts) LAST after the supposed ""Finale"" as it gives more Closure and is likely to distract you from the storylines left completely in the air...

Dirty Sexy Money However in the end of the day is a Diamond in the rough that never got to reach its full Potential.",1250467200,4,2899,5.012474012474012
3884997,2,B002AK9UOU,"In its first, strike-shortened season,""""Dirty Sexy Money"" was a more-than-acceptable diversion that embraced its campy side and flaunted its eccentricities as much as its Darling family flaunt their excess. It was, quite simply, fun. Cut to the second season and the show somehow managed to systematically drain every drop of enjoyment from its vaults. What remained was a shell of a once-intriguing ride, with snoozer B-plots that were forgettable last year brought to the forefront only to remain just as sleep-inducing.

Take the yawn of a confusing subplot involving Karen Darling (Natalie Zea, who tries, she really does) seducing billionaire Simon Elder (Blair Underwood) because...well...apparently Elder is a threat to the Darling family, though he has never done anything that seems even remotely powerful or assertive except saying he's powerful and assertive while staring intensely. Underwood is a hugely charismatic actor, but seems utterly lost in the useless role, and drags the still-charming Zea down in every scene they share together.

Want more bad storylines? We've got plenty. The long-simmering story of who killed Nick's father,--which only took up five forgettable minutes of every episode in the first season,--was turned into some sort of umbrella arc for the season. Perhaps the writers have forgotten that viewers don't really care about a character that has never been on the show, was a scoundrel and wasn't even liked by his son, and therefore could care less about who killed him. But despite every sign of logic screaming to stop while you are ahead, ""DSM""continued to devote the bulk of most of the season two episodes to the lame mystery, dulling the usually sharp Jill Clayburgh by making her the prime suspect and bringing in Lucy Liu (who deserves much, much better than this, or ""Cashmere Mafia"") for no particular reason to prosecute the case.

Liu is secretly bedding Jeremy Darling (Seth Gabel). While in the past Jeremy has been nothing but a cad, the viewer was always led to believe he was, at heart, a good person, but allowing him to sleep with the woman trying to send his mother to the electric chair turned him into an irredeemable piece of ****. Yes, there is a twist, and instead of vindicating Jeremy, it just further implicates another member of the family and makes him/her irredeemable as well.

Enjoyable characters that once were the hallmarks of the show's eccentricities have disappeared or been killed off, leaving the remaining Darlings and other roadkill characters wandering through large sets saying overblown dramatic dialogue. If the charming Juliet Darling or Carmelita were still around, they would chuckle and point at the things the main characters were saying. True, Carmelita returned briefly before being murdered, but apparently could barely speak when onscreen because because Donald Sutherland was too busy arguing with Steven Baldwin about something melodramatic. Juliet gave the series much of its life and kept it from becoming too full of itself (by being too full of herself), and the loss of the character has taken its toll on most of the ensemble.

Soon the urge to turn off the Darlings babbling on overdramatically and investing themselves in uninteresting subplots must have become too appealing for most viewers, because ABC cancelled the show midway through the season, airing the final (just as atrocious) episodes on Saturdays months later. It's such a shame that a show with, for all intents and purposes, one of the best ensembles on television, could fall so far so quickly.",1248825600,11,3570,5.16955017301038

I actually hired Season 1 here in New Zealand but could not get Season 2.
I bought two copies from Amazon one of which would not play as it was region coded but the other did.
The movie was star studded but fell down with too many 'holes' of the individual characters like the series was unfinished and the character's lives were still up in the air including the 'dead' father of Peter Kraus.
If you want to watch a series literally without end then buy it otherwise stick to a fully finished series.

Depicting  the  lives and innuendos  of a family of immense wealth and at the same time be able to show their vulnarability and shortcomings could hold one's attention . Unfortunately this did not happen , everything was too obvious ,no subtlety and the actors seemed  a little lost as to the real portraits of  their characters.

So I was agreeably surprised after watching the second and maybe ""final"" season of the series ,so  much more interesting than the previous one. The characters were more real and their  human traits  came through, in spite of the superficial dilemmas of the ""very rich"". Although  light and entertaining, this fun comedy came with nice doses of suspense this time around.  I think it is a pity if it does not continue. I am a great fan of Donald Sutherland and love the way he depicts this manipulating, heartless tycoon and still show his humanity when confronted with his daughter's shenanigans. Because the ending did not define a true ""the End"" I am keeping my fingers crossed in the hope this means a possible third Season on the way!

They didn't give the show its proper due, and then wondered why it fell apart in the ratings. ABC shuffled Twin Peaks along the schedule after it produced super bowl numbers. They had it on Tuesday, Thursday, then Saturday. They keep garbage shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" on but great shows like ""Dirty Sexy Money"" get the shaft. At least they haven't destroyed ""Lost."" Then again, season 6 hasn't hasn't looked so hot thus far.",1266192000,,578,4.676470588235294
