7889657,5,6305472319,Good show but not a Pride FC.  I'm adding my review only to lt people know that you get the same for cheaper if you look here in Amazon under Extreme Fighting instead of Battlecade:Extreme Fighting.,1068854400,4,198,4.5
7889658,4,6305472319,"The first major American MMA event other than the UFC had quick/mismatched fights along with a classic. During the earlier days of MMA, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu reigned supreme. Brazilians like Ralph Gracie, Conan Silviera, Carlson Gracie, jr., and Mario Sperry were to show their ""superior"" fighting skills, but not all of them succeeded. Both Ralph and Carlson Gracie had individual fights, while Conan and Mario ""Zen Machine"" Sperry had a tournament to deal with. The fight between Sperry and Igor Zinoviev was and is till this day a classic. That fight alone is worth the purchase of this DVD/VHS.",984268800,3,596,5.091836734693878
7889659,2,6305472319,"I love watching great fights w/ wicked strikes, blood, drama, and  knockouts.  A few of the fights were mildly entertaining but nothing worth  the purchase.  If you're a collector of mano e mano brawls on DVD then by  all means add this to your collection.  However if you're relatively new to  full contact fighting you might get frustrated w/ the mostly ground based  jujitsu-style techniques employed throughout this particular tournament.",968716800,3,442,5.214285714285714
7889660,3,6305472319,"I first saw this on VHS mode in a video store, and it's quite amusing.... I'm a huge UFC fan and I decided to stray for a weekend and grabbed it... I was impressed with the documentary-ish beginning... but this entire event  seemed to be the minor league of bare-knuckle fighting. It stars Conan  Silviera, whom in these fights was like a god, but as he approached the  UFC, got beat like a rug. If you are into seeing some not-so-horrible  matches, or want something different, get this DVD, but if you expect UFC  quality fighting, stick with the big boys....",963532800,6,561,4.514851485148514
7889661,5,6305472319,It's one of the best that I have seen in a long time.  I watched it on DVD at a friends house.  After it was over I proceeded to Amazon.com to buy it.  I would recommend this video to any who likes action.,952732800,4,205,3.7209302325581395
