2603134,5,B000GAKCSO,Buy this for the lap of the Old 'Ring alone. That'll put lead in your Eberhard Faber or your already dead. Just to be along with the likes of Sir Derek Bell is an honor well worth the price of admission!,1351036800,,203,3.975609756097561
2603135,1,B000GAKCSO,"Ordered In Car 956 dvd and received something call American Muscle Cars.
There was a little sticker on the back which said ""car 956"" but it was obvious from looking at the title and graphics that wasn't the case.
Very frustrating.",1348272000,,230,4.634146341463414

2603137,5,B000GAKCSO,"This DVD is fantastic. For anyone who has ever watched a motor race and thought ""I could do that"" then watch this and see just how hard it is to drive a very powerful car on the limit around circuits where a mistake could mean your death.
The driver is Derek Bell, who was a works Porsche driver when the Porsche 956 was all-conquering. During the 1984 season a camera was placed in Bell's car during the practice session on a number of circuits and this DVD was the result. Circuits such as Silverstone, Nurburgring (the North Ring), Le Mans (before it was emasculated), Spa (the modern version) are some of the treats. On some circuits Bell commentates, sometimes whilst driving, on other circuits a producer provides the narration, unfortunately, not always accurately but this is a minor distraction.
For any fan of motor racing this is an essential addition to any DVD library.",1219536000,,882,4.733766233766234
2603138,4,B000GAKCSO,"If you are Porsche/racing fan this is a must have. You are a passenger in one of the most successful race cars ever produced. World champion Derek Bell is your driver and gives an excellent technical review on how to navigate some of the world's best road race circuits in existence.

Filmed in 1984, the video and sound are some what dated by todays standards but then again, who cares? You get to ride along in a 650 bhp Rothmans Porsche 956 at 220+ mph! Enjoy the ride!",1205107200,,472,4.363636363636363

It does play on my all regions player. Maybe it's just this disc doesn't like my player, who knows? Other than that the content
is pretty good.",1482192000,,213,4.435897435897436
8129811,3,B000GAKCSO,"The reason the picture on the package cover is blurry is because the entire DVD is blurry. The field of view is not properly oriented to give a good ride for you as the viewer. It appears to be a very, very amateur production and consequently overpriced. Too bad the proper equipment wasn't used available or maybe not even available.",1457308800,,334,4.583333333333333

8129814,5,B000GAKCSO,"Wow! A great video!

I must warn you that the start of the video is not very good but if you can bear with it for about 10 minutes you are going to get a terrific insight of what is to drive something that is this fast and powerful. As an amateur driver I have to say it is an absolutely brilliant gem of a video especially if you want to know what it is like to race on some of the most historic race tracks in the world. Anyone who thinks these drivers are not athletes should watch this video. Almost the whole video is from inside the cockpit and the drivers actual perspective.

It is rough and not high definition but it is absolutely the best video I have ever watched from a drivers perspective. It is better than watching F1 or the LeMans live on television. In this video you almost feel the elevation changes that somehow never get their due on television.",1447632000,2,867,4.216867469879518

As close as we can ever get to driving the finest racing cars ever built , on the most famous and demanding tracks in the world .  Only wish it were six hours long .  Highly recomended by Lee.",1400803200,2,248,3.641509433962264
8129818,5,B000GAKCSO,"Own this on VHS but don't have VCR anymore.  The instant download was great, the quality is very good for early 1980's video technology. This is not some Forza or Gran Turismo simulation but the real thing.  The cockpit ride with Derek Bell through the old Le Mans circuit and the Nurburgring are worth the price itself.  This video will give you a new appreciation for the bravery and expertise of these drivers while piloting these land rockets.
Great stuff",1400198400,2,459,4.7125
