8265736,2,B0017GFV7S,"Closing The Deal would have been given a rating of just 1 had it not featured one of the stars of the later series of Baywatch, Michael Bergin. The film is simply boring and I would not recommend it to anyone except fans of Bergin. He does take his shirt off briefly on one occasion to display his Baywatch perfect body, but that's about it.",1332720000,,341,4.2615384615384615
