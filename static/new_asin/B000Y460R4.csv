8230915,5,B000Y460R4,This video is great for my elementary art room!,1481500800,,47,4.333333333333333
8230916,1,B000Y460R4,"Do not show in Elementary ED!!!!  or at least stop the video at the 18 min spot.

I don't want to give this DVD a bad review but I wish it had a warning. This series caters to art education, especially elementary. The DVD is great up until they discuss how VanGogh shot himself in the head! I've never felt the need to preview any of the getting to know series (which I have several of) until now.. Pretty upset that they get into this suicide so casually. I hate censorship but I really don't think that this is a topic for the first grade.. REALLY wish this DVD had a warning.",1427241600,8,578,4.151785714285714

8230918,5,B000Y460R4,"I use this video in Art Class for Middle School.  It is fun, truthful, not too long.  It handles the suicide aspect quickly and effectively.  Great quick, fun video.  I do wish the series were not so expensive!",1378598400,4,210,4.447368421052632
8230919,5,B000Y460R4,This is a wonderful biography of Van Gogh for children. The program has many beautiful artworks and fun animation. But don't buy the VHS when the DVD is still in print!,1358121600,,168,4.451612903225806
8230920,4,B000Y460R4,Kids love this video. It's very entertaining and educational at the same time. The only thing I was NOT happy with was how it talks about how Van Gogh shot himself at the end of the video.  Young children do not need to know that!,1273363200,,230,4.111111111111111
