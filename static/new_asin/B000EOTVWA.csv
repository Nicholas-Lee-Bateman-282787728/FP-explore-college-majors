8112127,5,B000EOTVWA,"I knew of comedian Joe E. Brown growing up, but never really had a chance to watch his films (with the exception of ""The Gladiator""). Now, many years later, DVDs have happily given me that chance! 1937's ""Fit for a King"" is one of the first of Brown's movies for independent producer David Loew. Ignore the ""B movie"" label these films have been branded with; they're actually a joy to watch, simply because Brown is in them!
Here, ""the mouth that roared"" plays Virgil Jones, a wanna-be news reporter who's been relegated to ""go-fer"" by his editor who thinks he's a nuisance. Tired of fetching sandwiches & coffee for his boss, Virgil gets his first big break: His boss (as a way of getting rid of him) sends Virgil on a ""meaningless"" story overseas to a small country. But the boss unknowingly plops Virgil in the middle of a MAJOR story as this country explodes with political intrigue...and Virgil becomes a hero for uncovering a plot to assassinate a lovely princess. There are great comedy bits here to relish: Thrown into the ship's brig, Brown tries to eat dinner during a storm as his dinner table slides back & forth; attempting to elude a rival reporter, Brown dons disguises as a wheelchair-bound Gramps, and as a maid (!); and the movie's big climax as Brown races to foil the assassination via motorcycle, hay wagon & bicycle! Even when there's nothing funny going on, you can rely on Brown's rubbery facial reactions (and surefire tradmark yell) to get a laugh.
Definitely one of Mr. Brown's best!",1297468800,6,1510,4.7018867924528305
8112128,5,B000EOTVWA,"I've loved Joe E Brown's films since I was a child. These days I enjoy them as much as ever. I feel he is a great and unique comic who's work is mostly overlooked today. I wish all of his great films were restored and made available on DVD. The few that are available serve as a good start. Let's hope more are on the way!
