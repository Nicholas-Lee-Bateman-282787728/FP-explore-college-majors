Movie Review: The first Death Wish was a thought provoking movie about vigilantism and how stupid parasitic pieces of **** should all die. Death Wish 2, 3 and 4 is pretty much absurd over-the-top exploitation action films. AND I LOVE IT!

3136481,4,B0014ZUG2C,"I bought this for the mere fact that it contains Death Wish 3 in its original widescreen ratio.

The only downside is the compression that must necessitate 3 films on one disc.  At times the motions can ghost a bit which is easily noticed upon freeze framing.

In THAT sense,  At times it's not as clear or organically analogous to the film as my old VHS for clarity,  but this is a godsend for any one who is a fan of this seemingly deliberately over the top exploitation,  good over evil, triumphant, quotable, war zoned,  entertainingly EXCESSIVE and clich film that manages to overindulge BEYOND the scope of credibility into a cartoon like ghoulishness.

Guilty pleasure,  don't take it too seriously.

Read all the other reviews elsewhere;  Death Wish 3 is possibly the greatest b movie EVER made.

I can't even begin to write critically about the film,  for it warrants a treatise, and I shall begin to salivate.

This film alone warrants a Criterion edition.

Part one was the most legitimate film,  and like it's contemporaries ROCKY,  and RAMBO;  should be viewed as the one to be respected and revered.  DW 1 is full of characterization,  whereas all subsequent films were exploitative.

DW3 is pure movie magic.  The fourth great achievement of Charles Bronson's career. .... wait. .. maybe 5th (*let's not forget bagging a Fox like Jill Ireland) for after Once Upon a Time in The West,  The Magnificent Seven,  The Mechanic,  Death Wish 3 is the crowning achievement of his career,  and should be enshrined in the library of congress.

I only wish it was accorded such respect before the majority of the cast had died.

5 stars for FINALLY getting a release in widescreen
-1 star for compression

For new fans + 1/2 star.  Leave it at 4 1/2 .... this film jumped the forehead painted shark, brutally mugged it and then shot it with Wildey.

A new height in cinema was achieved with Death Wish 3, one never to be approached again.",1403049600,,1942,4.673590504451038

3136491,3,B0014ZUG2C,"This 3 Pack action set is very good indeed, with picture and sound being presentable, and I had no trouble with any audio synchronization on my particular copy. No trailers, no audio commentaries, no previews, no interviews, no nuttin'. Just the movies themselves, and that is pretty much what is to be expected.
The old Blockbuster video guides panned these pictures, and I no longer allow their opinions to drive my taste in film collecting/viewing. However, in terms of this series, their reviews are mostly dead on. Bronson really doesn't react much in these movies, he merely responds. Like Clint Eastwood, he is not much of an actor, but he is a tremendous presence, and that presence is nearly lost here. These films really do feel like fly-by-night screenplays. My problem here is that the original film was NOT an action movie, but in the sequels, they've drained these characters of all feeling and mystery and replaced them with ultra-violent contexts. I have no idea if a study of film history will find any use for these pictures; ""Death Wish 3"" is really repugnant, and ""Death Wish 4"" is a going-through-the-motions affair, not passionate, not logical in the slightest. While I can understand someone having Bronson's reaction to having a loved one assaulted and/or killed, it's a good thing not everyone grieves in the way that he does or we would have several wars going on in the streets! Of course, these films are really fantasies more than realistic commentaries upon social problems, but even in this context of revenge-fantasy storytelling the movies are not really successful. Bronson meanders through each performance instead of using his facial features to grand effect like he did in the original. While other reviewers are right that ""Death Wish 2"" is the best film of the lot, by the end we are left asking, what's the point? If you watch and own the original ""Death Wish"" film, you pretty much have all you need of this show.
I keep wondering about how Brian Garfield feels about these sequels, because his original story (for the original film) was so altered for the film version that he is probably embarrassed that these works are so tightly connected with his cinematic legacy. While charlatans were busy working on the fourth film, Garfield was busy working on a great under-appreciated film like ""The Stepfather"", a very scary movie that is better than any of this dreck here. So, while I don't like to under-value the B-movie/exploitation aesthetic, and while I don't like the Blockbuster or Maltin guides much any more, these two films are known for their intentional flouts of quality, which has, unfortunately, had such a strong influence upon the meat-headed marketplace of today. What happens to Bronson's family is very sad, and he should be more devastated than he seems here, and the sequels seem to have forgotten that his family has been killed, along with every other love of his life. By the time of ""Death Wish IV: the Crackdown"" it's like we are watching a different character completely, in a completely unrelated story. With all of this death and tragedy, why are viewers saying that these films are not drama? No wonder Garfield finds the intellectual hijacking of these properties so hard to take, because the sequels have all become action pieces instead of great serious dramas that they should have been. Oh well, some people seem to enjoy them--but you have to do so on a very simple-minded level. C",1390003200,4,3458,4.89267461669506

3136508,3,B0014ZUG2C,"A good buy but only if you are a serious Charlie Bronson fan.
But these three sequels, however, were not as good as the original Death Wish.
You can see the decline in quality and entertainment value as the sequel number gets higher.

Death Wish 2 was OK. It is basically a version of Death Wish but in LA.

In Death Wish 3 Charlie Bronson's character is visiting an inner city neighborhood to help out a friend.
The residents of this inner city neighborhood  eventually join together with Charlie Bronson in a final big
shoot out with a gang of street punks. The neighborhood becomes a war zone with lots of property damage
and some dead bodies on both sides. The police mostly just drive around the neighborhood and try not to
get in the way of all the shooting until the good guys win.

For Death Wish 4 Bronson's character doesn't seem to have a regular job anymore. I guess he's a
full time Vigilante now.  In DW4 our hero gets tricked into starting a mobster gang war
and now has to clean things up to restore the rule of law.
Death Wish 4 was a bad movie.  It is what you expect from a classic B-movie. If you have never
seen this movie, you didn't miss out on anything worthwhile.",1355529600,,1188,4.328828828828829

Death wish 2 continues where Death Wish 1 left off with his daughter getting raped & dieing while trying to escape.  Bronson gets his revenge in very creative ways.

Death Wish 3 is different from all the other 4 Death Wish movies in that Charles Bronson takes on an entire gang and wins.  A lot of violence and is fun & humorous to watch though a little cheesy.  The best scene is where the Head NYPD cop teams with Bronson while running down the street shooting gang members.  The camera pans and follows them while they're running.  This was a creative technique coined in this movie that was used in future movies.  The gun used in the movie is very cool and can be seen at [...]
It has varying barrel lengths you can buy and a built in air cartridge to reduce kick.  You can buy one now but they are heavy guns.

If you saw the original; 2,3,4 were more sensational.  If you thought Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry were violent; Bronson's movies had a much higher body count.  This isn't high drama here! It's about Paul Kersey (Bronson) getting the bad guys in very creative ways.  What were you expecting?  Some of them were predictable, some of them were not as bad as I expected. For a Saturday afternoon you can't go wrong with Bronson's matter of fact delivery of his lines. There will never be another guy like him. You can be sure Stallone and Swartzenegger saw his movies before they had feature film careers. Bronson was a true original and I still wish he was around!",1322092800,20,836,4.653061224489796

Picture quality: all 3 movies are on 1 DVD.  I have a 1080p-upconverting DVD player, and compared the picture to that broadcast on AMC HD in 1080i.  There is no noticeable difference between them.  Imho, AMC HD broadcast quality is sub-par, so I believe some compression was used to put all 3 movies on one DVD.  But that is what I would expect.  I knew that when I bought the DVD.

3136523,5,B0014ZUG2C,"First and foremost, do NOT buy the MGM dvds for Death Wish 2, 3, and 4 individually because they are all in full screen.  This set however, all three movies are in widescreen.

All three films are on one disc, and the disc isn't double-sided either, so all three movies are on one side.  You'd think there would be compression issues with quality, but I didn't notice any.  As far as I noticed, all three films are mono sound, and the dvd is otherwise barebones, excluding even trailers, but the films themselves are presented in good widescreen and that's all that should matter.

As a movie, Death Wish 2 is good. About on par with the first film.  Death Wish 3 is excellent, with a lot more action and good story development.  Death Wish 4 is fairly standard, but you can't go wrong with Charles Bronson.

An important thing to note is the sound. I read other reviews saying that there were sound issues on part 4 claiming it goes out of sync halfway through, but I just watched the film and there were NO problems in that department.  The sound worked fine all the way through, but be aware that the problem exists for other people who bought this product.",1315699200,14,1160,4.459715639810427

3136528,4,B0014ZUG2C,"A few years ago, MGM finally released Death Wish 2-4 on DVD for the first time.  Unfortunatly, they decided to give them Fullscreen only releases.  Now, they've righted (most of) their wrongs and made Widescreen versions of Death Wish 2-4 available for the first time.  Oh, and Assassination is included as well.

On the down-side, the movies have zero extras (not even a trailer.  On top of that, there's no subtitles or chapter breaks.  Many will also be disappointed to know that Death Wish 2 is still the same R-rated version that was released before.

As for the actual movies, here's my opinion:

Death Wish 2- Even though it's the R-rated version, the movie was still pretty shocking.  Wheras in the first movie Bronson was killing random criminals, he's now focused on hunting down the creeps that killed his surviving daughter from the first movie (as well as the cleaning lady).  It was also nice to see the cop from the first movie come back as well.

Death Wish 3- My personal favorite in the series.  Bonson come back to NY to visit an old friend only to find out he was brutally murdered by a gang of thugs.  This movie is a whole lot of fun especially when the last half-hour turns into a video game (complete with a second player joinin no less).

Death Wish 4- A step down from the previous two, but still a solid movie.  Instead of fighting punks, Bronson joins in on the war on drugs by taking out members from two different gangs until a full-fledged war between the two groups errupt.  Highlight includes Bronson delivering a wine bomb to a table full of criminals (one of them being Danny Trejo).

Assassination- Bronson plays a secret service agent assigned to protect the first lady from an attempted assassination.  Not a whole lot of action in this movie, butl still pretty entertaining.",1298851200,5,1813,4.647798742138365
3136529,3,B0014ZUG2C,"Not to put too fine a point on it, as these aren't exactly art films, but it's fairly clear that 'Death Wish' 2-4 actually were shot with the intention of being shown in a 1.33:1 format (TV/video-market friendly for the time; see IMDB's production specs) and later were matted for theatrical release, so the old fullscreen DVDs by MGM are not pan-and-scan and rather offer a noticeably larger picture-- that is, one which includes everything the director meant for the lens to capture-- than the widescreen versions that appear on this TGG set. By contrast, the original 'Death Wish' (arguably the best in the series, as the plotlines and Kersey's motivations wear increasingly thin in the sequels), like the majority of big-studio movies since the mid-1950s, was shot for widescreen consumption, so a fullscreen print of it would be considered generally undesirable as it either would have to be cropped on the sides to fit a standard screen or would include areas the director had designated to be blocked out (for boom mikes, shadows, extraneous movement, etc.). While there's certainly no harm in wanting to have the later DWs cut, as they are here, to resemble their theatrical aspect ratios, in these atypical cases I think it's preferable to have more picture than less; in other words, MGM had it right the first time.",1297987200,3,1326,4.924107142857143

The only downside is the compression that must necessitate 3 films on one disc.  At times the motions can ghost a bit which is easily noticed upon freeze framing.

In THAT sense,  At times it's not as clear or organically analogous to the film as my old VHS for clarity,  but this is a godsend for any one who is a fan of this seemingly deliberately over the top exploitation,  good over evil, triumphant, quotable, war zoned,  entertainingly EXCESSIVE and clich film that manages to overindulge BEYOND the scope of credibility into a cartoon like ghoulishness.

Guilty pleasure,  don't take it too seriously.

Read all the other reviews elsewhere;  Death Wish 3 is possibly the greatest b movie EVER made.

I can't even begin to write critically about the film,  for it warrants a treatise, and I shall begin to salivate.

This film alone warrants a Criterion edition.

Part one was the most legitimate film,  and like it's contemporaries ROCKY,  and RAMBO;  should be viewed as the one to be respected and revered.  DW 1 is full of characterization,  whereas all subsequent films were exploitative.

DW3 is pure movie magic.  The fourth great achievement of Charles Bronson's career. .... wait. .. maybe 5th (*let's not forget bagging a Fox like Jill Ireland) for after Once Upon a Time in The West,  The Magnificent Seven,  The Mechanic,  Death Wish 3 is the crowning achievement of his career,  and should be enshrined in the library of congress.

I only wish it was accorded such respect before the majority of the cast had died.

5 stars for FINALLY getting a release in widescreen
-1 star for compression

For new fans + 1/2 star.  Leave it at 4 1/2 .... this film jumped the forehead painted shark, brutally mugged it and then shot it with Wildey.

3370988,3,B0014ZUG2C,"This 3 Pack action set is very good indeed, with picture and sound being presentable, and I had no trouble with any audio synchronization on my particular copy. No trailers, no audio commentaries, no previews, no interviews, no nuttin'. Just the movies themselves, and that is pretty much what is to be expected.
The old Blockbuster video guides panned these pictures, and I no longer allow their opinions to drive my taste in film collecting/viewing. However, in terms of this series, their reviews are mostly dead on. Bronson really doesn't react much in these movies, he merely responds. Like Clint Eastwood, he is not much of an actor, but he is a tremendous presence, and that presence is nearly lost here. These films really do feel like fly-by-night screenplays. My problem here is that the original film was NOT an action movie, but in the sequels, they've drained these characters of all feeling and mystery and replaced them with ultra-violent contexts. I have no idea if a study of film history will find any use for these pictures; ""Death Wish 3"" is really repugnant, and ""Death Wish 4"" is a going-through-the-motions affair, not passionate, not logical in the slightest. While I can understand someone having Bronson's reaction to having a loved one assaulted and/or killed, it's a good thing not everyone grieves in the way that he does or we would have several wars going on in the streets! Of course, these films are really fantasies more than realistic commentaries upon social problems, but even in this context of revenge-fantasy storytelling the movies are not really successful. Bronson meanders through each performance instead of using his facial features to grand effect like he did in the original. While other reviewers are right that ""Death Wish 2"" is the best film of the lot, by the end we are left asking, what's the point? If you watch and own the original ""Death Wish"" film, you pretty much have all you need of this show.
I keep wondering about how Brian Garfield feels about these sequels, because his original story (for the original film) was so altered for the film version that he is probably embarrassed that these works are so tightly connected with his cinematic legacy. While charlatans were busy working on the fourth film, Garfield was busy working on a great under-appreciated film like ""The Stepfather"", a very scary movie that is better than any of this dreck here. So, while I don't like to under-value the B-movie/exploitation aesthetic, and while I don't like the Blockbuster or Maltin guides much any more, these two films are known for their intentional flouts of quality, which has, unfortunately, had such a strong influence upon the meat-headed marketplace of today. What happens to Bronson's family is very sad, and he should be more devastated than he seems here, and the sequels seem to have forgotten that his family has been killed, along with every other love of his life. By the time of ""Death Wish IV: the Crackdown"" it's like we are watching a different character completely, in a completely unrelated story. With all of this death and tragedy, why are viewers saying that these films are not drama? No wonder Garfield finds the intellectual hijacking of these properties so hard to take, because the sequels have all become action pieces instead of great serious dramas that they should have been. Oh well, some people seem to enjoy them--but you have to do so on a very simple-minded level. C",1390003200,4,3458,4.89267461669506

But these three sequels, however, were not as good as the original Death Wish.
You can see the decline in quality and entertainment value as the sequel number gets higher.

Death Wish 2 was OK. It is basically a version of Death Wish but in LA.

In Death Wish 3 Charlie Bronson's character is visiting an inner city neighborhood to help out a friend.
The residents of this inner city neighborhood  eventually join together with Charlie Bronson in a final big
shoot out with a gang of street punks. The neighborhood becomes a war zone with lots of property damage
and some dead bodies on both sides. The police mostly just drive around the neighborhood and try not to
get in the way of all the shooting until the good guys win.

For Death Wish 4 Bronson's character doesn't seem to have a regular job anymore. I guess he's a
full time Vigilante now.  In DW4 our hero gets tricked into starting a mobster gang war
and now has to clean things up to restore the rule of law.
Death Wish 4 was a bad movie.  It is what you expect from a classic B-movie. If you have never

Death Wish 3 is different from all the other 4 Death Wish movies in that Charles Bronson takes on an entire gang and wins.  A lot of violence and is fun & humorous to watch though a little cheesy.  The best scene is where the Head NYPD cop teams with Bronson while running down the street shooting gang members.  The camera pans and follows them while they're running.

As a movie, Death Wish 2 is good. About on par with the first film.  Death Wish 3 is excellent, with a lot more action and good story development.  Death Wish 4 is fairly standard, but you can't go wrong with Charles Bronson.

Now, they've righted (most of) their wrongs and made Widescreen versions of Death Wish 2-4 available for the first time.  Oh, and Assassination is included as well.

On the down-side, the movies have zero extras (not even a trailer.  On top of that, there's no subtitles or chapter breaks.  Many will also be disappointed to know that Death Wish 2 is still the same R-rated version that was released before.

As for the actual movies, here's my opinion:

Death Wish 2- Even though it's the R-rated version, the movie was still pretty shocking.  Wheras in the first movie Bronson was killing random criminals, he's now focused on hunting down the creeps that killed his surviving daughter from the first movie (as well as the cleaning lady).  It was also nice to see the cop from the first movie come back as well.

Death Wish 3- My personal favorite in the series.  Bonson come back to NY to visit an old friend only to find out he was brutally murdered by a gang of thugs.  This movie is a whole lot of fun especially when the last half-hour turns into a video game (complete with a second player joinin no less).

Death Wish 4- A step down from the previous two, but still a solid movie.  Instead of fighting punks, Bronson joins in on the war on drugs by taking out members from two different gangs until a full-fledged war between the two groups errupt.  Highlight includes Bronson delivering a wine bomb to a table full of criminals (one of them being Danny Trejo).

Assassination- Bronson plays a secret service agent assigned to protect the first lady from an attempted assassination.  Not a whole lot of action in this movie, butl still pretty entertaining.",1298851200,5,1813,4.647798742138365
3371026,3,B0014ZUG2C,"Not to put too fine a point on it, as these aren't exactly art films, but it's fairly clear that 'Death Wish' 2-4 actually were shot with the intention of being shown in a 1.33:1 format (TV/video-market friendly for the time; see IMDB's production specs) and later were matted for theatrical release, so the old fullscreen DVDs by MGM are not pan-and-scan and rather offer a noticeably larger picture-- that is, one which includes everything the director meant for the lens to capture-- than the widescreen versions that appear on this TGG set. By contrast, the original 'Death Wish' (arguably the best in the series, as the plotlines and Kersey's motivations wear increasingly thin in the sequels), like the majority of big-studio movies since the mid-1950s, was shot for widescreen consumption, so a fullscreen print of it would be considered generally undesirable as it either would have to be cropped on the sides to fit a standard screen or would include areas the director had designated to be blocked out (for boom mikes, shadows, extraneous movement, etc.). While there's certainly no harm in wanting to have the later DWs cut, as they are here, to resemble their theatrical aspect ratios, in these atypical cases I think it's preferable to have more picture than less; in other words, MGM had it right the first time.",1297987200,3,1326,4.924107142857143
