8308651,5,B001HDDCK4,"Bought Learn to Play Detroit Rock City By Kiss for my son.  He really enjoyed this product.  Just a fledging guitar player, he continues to make comments on how great this is.  And he has previously tried products by others not so great. Sure he will be back for other ""Learn To Play"" DVD's. Also very fast shipping . Thanks.",1431043200,,325,4.383333333333334
