Spoilers ahead!

Mizoguchi Kenjis career peaked in the years 1952-54 in which he won international success becoming the darling of the Cahiers du Cinma crowd and picking up prizes at the Venice Film Festival in three consecutive years for The Life of Oharu (1952), Ugetsu Monogatari (1953) and Sansh Day (1954). Chikamatsu Monogatari (1954) also won great success at home, but there is a slight decline in the gendaigeki modern day drama Uwasa no Onna (1954) which is confirmed by two flawed excursions into the jidaigeki historical period film shot in colour (Shin Heike Monogatari is an improvement on the dramatically inert Ykihi [both 1955]). Mizoguchis final film Akasen Chitai returns to b/w and to the very same anti-patriarchy/prostitution theme of saka Elegy and Sisters of the Gion (both 1936), the two works he regarded as his first real films (a view which disregards the 50 odd films he made before 1936, most of which are lost and some of which are said to have been masterpieces!). Happily, Akasen Chitai is a near-masterpiece, a marvelous return to form, and a valedictory wholly typical statement which caps an extraordinary body of work. Few (if any) directors can rival Mizoguchi for his consistently high level of quality achieved over the space of some three decades. Andrey Tarkovsky is a very special director for me and in Sculpting in Time he has this to say: Think of Mandelstam, think of Pasternak, Chaplin, Dovzhenko, Mizoguchi and youll realize that tremendous emotional power is carried by those exalted figures who soar above the earth, in whom the artist appears not just as an explorer of life, but as one who creates great spiritual treasures and that special beauty which is subject only to poetry. Such an artist can discern the lines of the poetic design of being. He is capable of going beyond the limitations of coherent logic, and conveying the deep complexity and truth of the impalpable connections and hidden phenomena of life. To appreciate Akasen Chitai I feel it is important to contextualize it in relation to both Mizoguchi the man and Mizoguchi the director. The film stands on its own as a quality work to be sure, but it means so much more if we understand the nature of its creator and his past films.

Like every characteristic Mizoguchi film, Akasen Chitai centers on the key theme of women unfairly used and abused by patriarchy. Behind this pervasive theme lies a dichotomy between the Mizoguchi who attacks this social inequality with a series of narratives which indict men while eulogizing the strengths of women, and the Mizoguchi who endorses patriarchy by using and abusing women himself both professionally and in his private life. A voracious life-long devourer of geisha and prostitutes, Mizoguchi famously broke down when visiting the prostitutes ward of an saka hospital while preparing Women of the Night (1948). He told the patients, If you are here, its the fault of menIts MY fault too! Fueled also by other private circumstances (his beloved sister Suzu being sold off to virtual geishadom by his hated father, his education being funded by Suzus rich patron, his wife Chieko sinking into [some say] syphilis-induced insanity in 1941 while he worked on The Loyal 47 Ronin without ONCE taking a day off to take care of her), this dichotomy which stirred up so much guilty personal antagonism is most likely the creative well-spring for the incredible richness that feeds into the two kinds of film he was synonymous with, the jidaigeki folk tale legend and the gendaigeki womens melodrama.

The handling of women in both these forms is fundamentally different. As Dudley Andrew says in Mizoguchi a Guide to References and Resources (G. K. Hall, 1981), the jidaigeki are legends of women who suffer for an idea of culture that the film valorizes at the end. In a patriarchal culture the inequality between men and women is part of a cosmic friction which just is  it is a metaphysical given which artists like Mizoguchi can show, but cannot change. The suffering of women is a necessary feature of social existence which humanizes/determines civilization as it has come down to countries and cultures (like Japan) where patriarchy is still pervasive. The jidaigeki show history as having been made with womens suffering put into the context of this inevitable process. The gendaigeki on the other hand show history actually in the making where [Mizoguchis] heroines are in revolt against a system in which they are exploited, frequently without the aid of even the most fragile family support (Andrew). In the postwar democratic exposs (My Love Has Been Burning, Portrait of Madame Yuki, Oy-sama, The Lady From Musashino) women of isolated social position are brought tumbling done by the iniquities of patriarchy in a modernizing society, and in the films focusing on women without social position trapped in geisha houses, brothels or simply on the street (Women of the Night, Gion Bayashi, Uwasa no Onna, Akasen Chitai), they are forced first and foremost to rely on each other. What arises in these films is an instinct for salvation through generosity toward fellow women in revolt against the city of men (Andrew).

This revolt is usually cast as a clash between two ways of dealing with patriarchy, the first through meek traditional submissiveness and the second through radical rebellion and an attempt to play men at their own game. Sisters of the Gion, Gion Bayashi and Uwasa no Onna all center on the relationship between two women, the older one embodying tradition and the younger one rebellion, while Women of the Night and Akasen Chitai center on a group of afflicted women who help each other through necessity, but whose individual success depends on personal character, on each persons survival instinct made up of different degrees of both submissiveness and rebellion. All three narratives of the first group spin around the older wiser woman seeking to control and look after the younger one, and in all three the conclusion is the same, that whether a woman complies submissively or rebels, patriarchy crushes them anyway to the point that the only thing they have is each other. There is always pathos in the older womans position as she is resigned to accepting a fate which she knows cannot be avoided whilst delicately trying to make her younger charge aware of it. In Women of the Night and Akasen Chitai it is noticeable that submissiveness leads to no change and aggressive rebellion (playing men at their own game) is really the only route out of prostitution, though it is done at great personal risk. In Akasen Chitai this is crystallized in the sharp money bags character Yasumi who takes her customers and her fellow prostitutes for every yen they have.

It is noticeable that the films of the first group all take place in Kyts Shimabara red light district where the emphasis is on the old geisha tradition gradually being degraded or sullied, the pairs of women visualizing/verbalizing the on-going battle between submissiveness and rebellion. The films of the second group take place in saka and Tkys Yoshiwara district where tradition is more a historical relic of the past and the post-war situation of prostitutes is rendered as a straightforward split between aoisen (blue line) prostitution that we see in Women of the Night which is illegal, unregulated and highly dangerous street work; and akasen (red line) prostitution that we see in Akasen Chitai which is licensed with women working in organized legally owned brothels. In both cases Mizoguchi prefers to stress the group rather than focus on a pairing possibly because their situation is a national one, the overwhelmingly patriarchal society being the force that grinds them under. In the first group it is also national, but being more closely tied to tradition it is also much more individual, more personal.

In Sisters of the Gion the two ladies in question are sisters working as geisha, the older one following the traditional path of giri (obligation), and the younger one following the modern path of ninj (personal inclination). Both paths are shown to be equally fruitless as both ladies are crushed. In Gion Bayashi the two ladies are a kind of mother-daughter team, the older one in effect adopting the daughter of her deceased best friend. Again giri and ninj are pitted together and again both are thwarted by patriarchy, the only difference being in the character of the younger one. In Sisters of the Gion Omocha (Yamada Isuzu) is a ruthless bitch who attempts to play men at their own game while in Gion Bayashi Eiko retains a degree of feminist fight, but diluted with innocence and naivety. In Uwasa no Onna the two ladies are mother-daughter, the traditional mother Hatsuko (Tanaka Kuniyo) seeking to control and guide her rebellious daughter Yukiko (Kuga Yoshiko). The difference between these films is a question of milieu. All three take place in Shimabara, but while the first two are set in geisha houses, Uwasa no Onna takes place in a high class brothel. Moving to Yoshiwara, Akasen Chitai takes place in a low class brothel so we can see a very conscious intent on the directors part to document the various grades of houses of pleasure with an emphasis on their decline from the sophistication of the geisha profession to the crude functionality of sex establishments.

Another way to look at these films would be to see a circular pattern in the postwar films, starting and finishing on the street. Women of the Night is about prostitutes working on the street without the protection of houses and Mizoguchi moves from a geisha house (Gion Bayashi) to a high class brothel (Uwasa no Onna) to a low class brothel (Akasen Chitai) and then back out onto the street. Central to Akasen Chitai is an ongoing debate in parliament about abolishing prostitution and indeed this became fact soon after the film was released. Prostitution never dies of course, the legislation simply driving women out onto the streets in the situation we see in Women of the Night where they are subject to violent pimps, police brutality and lack of access to regular medical inspections. The point throughout all these films is that though Mizoguchi may appear to take a feminist stand against patriarchy with the geisha/prostitute in revolt against the city of men highlighted with the greatest empathy, patriarchy itself persists and remains pervasive as a central truth in the world he depicts. Indeed he remained a part of this patriarchy until the day he died. The submission/rebellion dichotomy in the way women deal with patriarchy is book-ended very interestingly with a message of hope. In Sisters of the Gion Omocha plays men at their own game and ends up almost dying by being pushed out of a moving car. Her whole body bandaged, she delivers a bitter denunciation of geishadom from her bed as her submissive sister (also crushed) takes care of her. The film strongly states that submit or fight there is no escape from patriarchy. In Akasen Chitai Yasumi is very much an Omocha figure who cons her customers out of a fortune with false promises, is almost killed by one of them, but ends up the proud owner of a dry goods store. Mizoguchi here shows there is at least the possibility of escape from patriarchy, rebellion being the only answer 20 years on from Sisters of the Gion. The other prostitutes we see are all, to varying degrees, too submissive, too traditional or too soft to essay a route out and are consequently destined for oblivion.

The action of Akasen Chitai centers on a brothel named Dreamland run by Taya Kuraz (Shind Eitar) and his wife Tatsuko (Sawamura Sadako). They are respectable proprietors who run the house well, taking care of the girls and fulfilling the role of parents. The films timeframe is provided by the on-going parliamentary debate on the banning of prostitution we hear carried out on the radio and to which Taya attends to learn about the fate of his business. For him the brothel business is a social service, providing for abandoned women exactly what the government cannot, namely jobs and a roof over their heads. He spells out clearly the undeniable truth that without brothels the women would be left on the street wide open to exploitation and disease. The film opens with a police officer visiting the brothel and to a radio broadcast of the ongoing debate. We first meet all the girls together when Taya gathers them to explain the consequences of banning prostitution. Then towards the end of the film there is another meeting where he tries to celebrate the defeat of the motion by ordering in sushi. The girls show no visible emotion except the silent acknowledgement that they are still bound in poverty with no improvement to their lot in sight. A powerful coda is provided by real events  prostitution was outlawed only a year after the film wrapped. This gave the film great topical interest and ensured its commercial success. What would have happened to the characters we see in the film is a moot point. The government promised to house them all and give them benefits, but the chances are they would simply ply their bodies on the streets, crossing over to that blue line and almost certain destruction.

The main body of the film is concerned with the five women who work in Dreamland, their back-stories, how they interact with each other, what happens to them, in short how they survive in a male-dominated, money-oriented society. Each woman is played by an actress famous in Japan and Mizoguchi uses the structure to present representative stories which collectively portray the lot of these down-trodden victims. The oldest is the widow Yumeko (Mimasu Aiko) who has nothing except the dream (her name means Dreamchild) that her son will eventually get a good job and look after her. Also middle-aged is Yorie (Machida Hiroko) who sacrificed herself to prostitution to help her poor farmer parents and who dreams of finding a man who will love her. Then there is Hanae (Kogure Michiyo), a housewife who supports her unemployed consumptive husband and baby child by working at Dreamland, but living in a poor apartment (shes the only one who doesnt live where she works). Younger than these is Yasumi (Wakao Ayako) whose fathers embezzlement ruined her, but made her determined to escape her lot by aggressively ripping off her clients and lending money to her colleagues at extortionate interest rates. Finally, there is Mickey (Ky Machiko) who is in rebellion against her rich father for his philandering which crushed her mother. She is the only girl who doesnt have to be there, but values independence (and self-ruin) above life in the crushing patriarchy of her own family.

The character of each woman is sharply delineated to identify definite types that Japanese audiences would all recognize. Mickey is the typical spoilt brat in recoil from a smothering home, Yasumi is the typical hard-working thrifty young upwardly-mobile self-achiever, Yumeko is the typical traditional mother type who expects her offspring to take care of her in her dotage, Yorie is the self-deluded romantic who pines for a lover to take her away, and finally Hanae is the self-less all-providing mother figure whose softness and caring attitude is her downfall. She is the most sympathetic of the women and is the heart of the film much as Miyoharu takes center stage in Gion Bayashi (Kogure Michiyo again). These characteristics are shown very succinctly in a scene in Hanaes apartment where all the girls give presents to Yorie who is leaving for the country thinking she has found her dream husband. Mickey demonstrates her callous thoughtlessness by giving her a train voucher which would give her money for the trip back to Tky if (when!) her marriage fails, Yasumi shows her thrifty money-oriented brain by giving her a bank book and stamp with a 500 yen deposit, Yumeko demonstrates her domestic compliance by giving some bowls, while Hanae is the only one who demonstrates real thought and belief that Yorie can really make a go of it by giving her a clock which at least suggests she now has time to make her life anew.

All his characters expertly drawn and placed in a vividly drawn locale, Mizoguchi structures the rest of the film around each of his characters, showing us how their different qualities lead to different results. Importantly he withholds the tear-jerking melodrama by simply observing the characters as a pathologist might. This makes for a cold effect which some critics have criticised, but the film gains enormously from its dispassionate presentation of a social reality in which each character is afforded equal attention.

Hanaes selfless submissiveness (of all the characters she is the least equipped for rebellion) is demonstrated by her walk with her family to a soba shop where she sits at the table holding a baby wearing a coat which is several sizes too large, summer sandals on her feet and her legs open in an indecent posture. Her wimp of a husband moans away and when he finishes his noodles Hanae gives him hers as well which he gobbles up greedily. She chooses survival above respect and meekly accedes to whatever life gives her. Her crisis point comes when she arrives home to find her husband in the process of hanging himself. It turns out they had already agreed not to commit suicide and she at last cries out her feelings in cold objective terms (How can we call Japan a civilized country when I cannot buy even the babys milk? Ill live to see how the country fares.), but the film offers her no answer at all. Submissive acceptance of the status quo isn't enough to change things for her.

Mickeys rebellion is contextualized when her father visits her. Up to this point she has done nothing to win audience sympathy. She borrows money from everyone around her, steals clients from her colleagues, and affects a Yankee bubble gum chewing attitude which if she were my daughter would invite a good bottom-smacking. However, everything is turned on its head when we understand through the conversation with her father why she has become a selfish hedonistic bitch. It was his philandering which upset her mother and which caused her to leave and he is not rescuing her now because he loves her. He simply doesnt want the scandal of her working in Yoshiwara spoiling his other daughters marriage or jeopardizing the respectability of his own business. In other words he wants her back in order to strengthen his own patriarchy. Our sympathy swings completely behind Mickey when we hear her mother died 6 months previously and the father has already married, again to give a faade of respectability to the family firm. This is a grand scene superbly acted by Ky and Ogawa Toranosuke as the father and its topped brilliantly by Mickey attempting to mock-seduce him on her bed. The scene works mainly because the audience knows this is a common story and a painful reality for many. The underlining horrific point is that Mickey is freer working as a prostitute than she is in the patriarchy of her respectable family. Prostitution for her is a form of patriarchy which she can at least live with!

Yumeko perhaps gets the longest and most elaborately worked out scenes mainly because these are the only times in the film where we leave the artificiality of the studio set Mizoguchi uses for Yoshiwara and the brothel. At first we see her journey into the country to her in-laws to find her son. We see poverty in the home there which makes life as a country peasant seem to be even worse than life as a prostitute. She is told her son has found factory work in Tky and her phone call to him is the first in the series of calls which annoy the son so much that he has to see her to tell her to stop contacting him. Turns out he has run away from the shame caused by villagers knowing about Yumekos profession, and now everyone in his factory knows about it as well. Yumeko simply expects he will now take care of her, but his blunt rejection hits home most forcefully when he answers her with Isnt it YOUR duty to take care of ME? This scene outside the factory is beautifully done. At first Mizoguchi has Yumeko shot from the ground looking up making her seem abnormally tall as she strides into the meeting confident that her worries will soon all be over, but during the confrontation with her son gradually she realizes her dream is unrealistic and the camera rises up pointing down at her as she sinks, sitting on top of a barrel amidst waste debris. As her son crushes her she becomes no different from the detritus that surrounds her. Finally as the son runs off, she tries to follow, her figure now miniscule in front of the huge factory behind her as a truck swings out and almost runs her over. The woman is crushed and indeed she has been pushed into insanity. Back at Dreamland she sits in a delirious trance and is eventually taken away to a sanitarium. This scene must have had painful autobiographical echoes for Mizoguchi whose wife Chieko was institutionalized back in 1941. Having worked in Dreamland, Yumeko (the dreamchild) finishes the film in a dreamland of her own. Dreaming does not transcend patriarchy any more than submissive shouldering of problems, let alone Yankee rebellion.

Perhaps most trenchant of all is Yories fate and it is with a sense of almost relief that Mizoguchi omits showing it. We saw her early in the film driving off to be married and work in the country, but near the end she returns, first shown lurking outside Dreamland ashamed of entering her old workplace. Turns out her husband just wanted cheap labour for his farm and she was simply expected to work as a slave. In a conversation with Hanae she reveals how she tried to get a decent job, but was told that women couldn't earn above a miniscule amount. She was thus forced into returning to Dreamland. This was the fate of thousands of Japanese women before they started to get more rights, and the simple fact that life in a brothel is better than the life a woman can get on her own through respectable labour is truly an eye-opener and an indication that Mizoguchi had an innate sympathy for women laid low by social circumstance which was often worse in the indentured slavery of marriage than it was in a geisha house or a well-run brothel like Dreamland.

At the end of the day only aggressive rebellion is the answer to lift downtrodden women out of prostitution as Yasumi shows. No submissiveness for her as she sells herself out body and soul (McDonald writing in her note) to get the money she needs to buy her freedom and take over a shop from the failed owner who she has used and abused. Her character is icy cold and it underlines Mizoguchis thesis that patriarchy reduces everything down to money-related terms and only those prepared to sell whatever goodness they ever possessed will survive in such a hard no-win situation. The dreamers, the upstart Yankees and the traditional ladies all don't stand a chance.

Mizoguchi retained the services of a number of his regulars for this film. Miyagawa Kazuos photography combines with Mizutani Hiroshis art direction to make for a wondrously shot series of interiors as we feel Dreamland as well as see it. Shots are long, camera angles are high with subtle pans and deep-focus deployed to engage us with the geometry of the house. Mostly the camera stays fixed studying the entrance and the passageway going up the stairs, but there is never any feel of stasis as the subtle camera movements fool us into thinking we are always moving. Much use is made of doorway and window framing, shots continuing by looking through windows after characters have left a room obviate any need for incessant cutting. No doubt this helps the acting which is flawless across the board. I challenge anyone to recognise Ky Machiko as the same actress that appeared in Rashmon! Kogure Michiyos good character may resemble Miyoharu in Gion Bayashi, but her deliberately frumpy presentation is unrecognisable, at once courageous and brilliantly brought off. Yoda Yoshikata is a notable absentee from the credits (the script is by Narusawa Masashige) as he felt he had run out of ideas for brothel stories (!) Also absent is the composer Hayasaka Fumio who is replaced by Mayuzumi Toshir. His electronic score deploying weird noises reminiscent of Edgard Varse at his most avant garde is inspired. Over the opening credits and a crane shot of the Yoshiwara area the odd whines, whoops and plops seem bizarre, but we quickly get the point that the music works as a sign that something is not quite right underneath everyday life as the music reoccurs as a leitmotif every time one of the characters sinks into crisis. This is very obvious in the case of Yumeko where the music suddenly cuts out to convey something snapping inside her as she goes insane. I guess not everyone will welcome the coldness with which Mizoguchi observes his characters and the Yoshiwara milieu itself. Those expecting to have a good cry as they did in Gion Bayashi will be disappointed. Also, we could acuse the way the film finishes as being a degree too contrived, too convenient with the new girl Shizuko (Kawakami Yasuko) bottling out on her first night, but I prefer to ignore the occasional imperfections and salute Mizoguchis valedictory achievement as the near-masterpiece it so obviously is. How sad then that within three months of the films wrap the great director was dead.",1490054400,,25647,4.865873197528038
