1366213,2,B00004WM3E,"This movie was good but it seems as if the director was not sure what path he wanted to take, did he want to go into the relationships that evolved around the rave or just show what it is like to experience it.  The director starts the movie by showing us how the party gets started and then builds it up from the average DJ's to John Digweed who finishes off the party.  But between the beginning and end, we get introduced to all these different characters, but he only skims the surface and we never learn much about them. This movie needed about an added 10 minutes at the beginning to give us some background on the characters, then it would have been much better and not just a rave with people we don't even know anything about.  The soundtrack had a few good songs, 2 of which were played at the end by Digweed.  But I don't think it is worthy of your purchase and neither is the DVD movie.  I would reccommend waiting for this to come on Cable or just rent it if you are really interested in this movie.
Buy If you saw it and loved it - Rent If you like Digweed and the idea of the movie really interests you -  Cable If you want to see a decent movie with some pretty good music -  Skip it If you hate trance/techno, and dislike the idea of raves.",975974400,4,1257,4.106122448979592
1366214,4,B00004WM3E,"I went to see this film with mixed emotions.  There have not been very many films on the subject, and definitely not many good ones. Groove's screenplay was definitely written by someone who has been there and done it.  It is, according to my experiences, spot on in the protrayal of club/rave life.
The warmup DJ with developing skills and a milkcrate of records in desperate need of a good break, all the way up to John Digweed, DJ God, with his $200 a piece cases of white labels and never-before-heard acetates.
The warehouse party, brought together by a seemingly selfless promotor working his tail off just to see people get together and groove, with maybe a ""nod"" at the end of the night, followed by cops raiding the party and kicking everyone out for no really good reason.
The couple who got to the ""map point"" too late and missed all the fun, but salvaged the night with a beach view, a car stereo, and a good mixtape.
The drugs: people you use them and enjoy, and people who abuse them and ruin the party for others.  People who sell for the fun of others, and people who sell for the profit, without the concern for others well being.
Two guys, both with a long history of electronic roots starting with industrial music.  One of them has progressed with the scene, the other has completely lost touch.  The music evolved and they didn't.  I don't know how many times I've seen old clubbers attempt to join a rave party and never ""getting it"".
The music: An absolutely fantastic cross-section of tunes by a variety of real DJs.  The most realistically filmed club-dance scenes I've ever seen.  You can feel the energy, just amazing.
I bought the audio CD and it does not do the film justice.  Maybe it was licensing issues, I'm not sure.  The bedrock track, which is pivotal to the movie, is included and is probably worth the cost of the disc.
As you can tell, I'm really looking forward to the DVD.  I would have given the film five stars but had to take off a bit for a couple of bad performances/script lines; John Digweed (Hey, he's a DJ, not an actor)  His lines should have hit the cutting room floor, as well as a couple of weak lines from different characters.
Overall though, this is a don't miss if you've been in the scene or maybe want to be.  For those folks you spent there weekend nights watching ""Saturday Night Live"" and going to bed before 1am, you may not get it.",971827200,,2396,4.442922374429224
1366215,4,B00004WM3E,"If you've been going out to parties(raves) for a while, you'll get a huge kick out of this movie. It hits home in so many ways, it is very funny to look at the rave scene from a different point of view. On the other hand, it reminds me of the ""good old days"" back when map points were the rule, and water was free. This was filmed in San Francisco, so it is based on that scene, if your not from here, then it may seem a little ""off"". Overall this was a great movie, and a great look(even for non-ravers) into a scene that has been growing and evolving tremendously in the last 10 years. I give it 4 stars, simply because the movie was great but at some points I feel the realism was lost.",971654400,3,689,4.0
1366216,5,B00004WM3E,"As a 'veteran' of the rave scene, it was refreshing to see this movement get some positive media attention versus the negativity that the press has given it.  While the rave scene has been plagued with its problems of drugs, the news makes it sound like dancing to music under the influence is a new thing.  Groove puts the positive aspects of the scene into the limelight by incorporating a great musical score and key emotions that go into promoting and searching for a venue.  Each moment was an uplifting emotion that makes you feel apart of something much more grand whether you are a raver or just enjoy dancing to music.  Just like any cultural and musical movement, there are down sides and good sides.  It's about time someone focused on the good sides of it.",971049600,2,768,4.576642335766423

1366302,3,B00004WM3E,"Groove, released in 2000, exposes through director Greg Harrison's eye a fragment of the San Francisco's underground electronic music scene and the glittery aliens that then inhabited it.  I found the effort to be genuine and mostly successful.

I logged a fairly lengthy tour in this world, and had just bowed out of it when I found this movie shortly after its release back in 2000.  Desperate for some semblance, I committed myself to what I hoped would be a just cinematic representation and was left a tad dejected.  The movie was promptly shelved and forgotten about.  This year, however, I decided to pop it in again and found it to be much more enjoyable.  The first time I watched was out of desperation, the second time was out of sweet nostalgia. I was inspired to write the review because of this.

The film, in a nutshell, spotlights an underground party and the results of its gravity.  Detailed are the organizational group efforts of the people that bring life to such a thing, followed by the adventures of its followers.  Anyone that has spent a night under the influence of a warehouse party and its accompanying elements will find something in this movie to smile about.  I was particularly attracted to scenes in the chill room, (or red room, where I'm from), because it felt real to me.  I remember fondly having similarly peaceful conversations amongst friends and strangers in this environment exactly.

I felt that true homage was paged to the DJs in this movie.  I also thought the director did a ample job addressing what it means to stand behind a set of turntables.  It's not just fader tossing.  The specifics of mixing weren't covered, but honestly, the only people interested in that are the people that already know how to DO it.  Anyone else is just there for a good time.

I wasn't a huge fan of the music, as it wasn't what I orbited around when I was partying, but I imagine it would translate well to anyone watching the movie, whether experienced in this genre or not.

At the risk of sounding verbose, I'll leave the individual stories contained in this story to the watcher.  Just know that there are a series of relationships outlined here, old or established that night, and they're all believable enough to make the project endearing.

The only problem I had with this movie, and it's cause for my rating, is the sporadic cheese that pops up throughout the film.  The interactions between the gay couple is highly stereotypical which makes their presence feel awkward.  Likewise, I suspected the main protagonist, played by Hamish Linklater, of over-acting at times.  I get that he's supposed to be high, but I'm guessing his on-screen unease had nothing to do with drug use.

The ascent of Gouda Mountain, however, happened when the party-thrower's assistant asks said party-thrower why he does what he does.  Feel free to fast-forward through one of the most unsatisfying speeches concering voluntary head-movements in the history of American cinema.  I actually groaned.

In the end, though, I think this is fine little movie and expect its harshest critics will come from those that either spent no time in this scene, or expected too much from a film with obvious limitations.

I think it's well worth the low prices I'm seeing here.

I am not a drummer and only purchased this tape for the live performances, however, I listen to alot of music and learned much about drumming theory and the different styles and how drum parts are created.  It is all done with a sense of humor mixed in with the lessons and there is even a short spot with a David Letterman drumming tutorial- who knew Dave could drum too!!

Most importantly though, this tape is a rare video record of the South African trio Skollie (Blondie Chaplin, keith Lentin and Anton Fig) performing live.  The tape includes three songs throughout - One song (Law and Order) from the 1992 Ostrich Man album and two other songs which remain unreleased (Cool Cool  Day & 1-2-3).  All three songs are great straight forward hard rock songs, no ballads here!!

The performances were filmed professionally with multiple cameras and are of excellent sound quality.  Blondie Chaplin contributes his usual outstanding vocal talent and some crankin' guitar solos.  Ketih lays a thick bass line and smooth backing vocals and Anton Fig pounds away with his usual great 'feel' and shines on the extended drum solos.

For the Skollie or Blondie Chaplin fan, let me say your collection is far from complete without these rare live performances.  The trio Skollie was a class act with great energy, astute professionalism and powerful riffs.  These guys are all three master musicians.

Don't let the price scare you off Blondie Chaplin fans, this tape is a must have for these performances!!!",1193788800,,1639,4.786476868327402

1366308,1,B00004WM3E,"I wish there was a - rating system, I would rate this at - 10 stars, the only good thing about this movie is John Digweed (he shows up at the end of the movie for 2 minutes) and Bedrocks Heaven Scent.

It was such a burden having to watch this whole movie, first of all the acting is horrible and waaaaaaay overdone; Pretentious is the word. The acting was like watching those kids candy commercials were there's all these skateboarders and ""extreme"" sports figures doing tricks to advertise the candy product. Then theres all these gay love scenes, of which I found very unnecessary. If this movie shows what the rave scene really is, I feel sorry for ravers, fortunately this is not what raving is all about.

This story shows a corporate-underground (hmmm those two words shouldnt be together, should they? Well they do in this movie) rave, you have the party planner sending e-mails to all these yuppys to let them know where the party is, then theres the ""going to the party"" thing, the wharehouse blah blah blah. Trying to look like a real rave, but the last I knew raves weren't sponsored by Levis or Starbucks!!

Then you have all these horrible actors trying to act like there all high on ecstasy, they just over do it, its like watching your granny trying to act like she's drunk.

Then theirs the dj's who act like their mixing by grabbing records, putting them on the turntable and cranking up the crossfader, any dj knows its not that simple. I'm not trying to disrespect the dj's, I bet John Digweed did a tiny part in this movie because the he probably got ditched by a club owner that didn't pay him for a gig and he needed the money to get back home.

Part of the movie is about this ""raver-couple"" who met each other like 2 days ago and are getting married, their ""love"" being completely influenced after using ecstasy (the love drug) and the dudes brother who is a complete pretentious nerd. The raver dude all the sudden is kissing another dude who is supposed to be the official rave massage guy!! I mean WTF?!!! Then his brother (pret. nerd) gets a hold on some E, of course he's never done any kind of narcotics or substance before, and he starts tripping and turns into a complete fool, he meets a chick who is supposed to be a veteran raver and she tries to guide him around his trip, then at the party he invites everyone for breakfest at his house, of course that doesnt happen because he didn't really like the people, he was just E happy.

Thank God theres and end to the movie, and at the end you get to see Digweed playing heaven scent, thats the only good part of the movie and it lasts like 2 minutes.

Oh I forgto to mention the ""police bust"". The police arrive at the party and the party organizer talks his way and gets a sngle cop to leave without checking any paper work or permit for the party, then later on the copps arrive and shut the party down in a raid like fashion, but guess what? No one gets arrested and the sound equipment doesnt get confiscated, the cops just run in the warehouse and run everybody out. Of course the nature of this movie wouldnt just let the people go home and stop filming this atrocity, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, the people go back to the warehouse, break the police lock and continue the party from where they left off. Totally unreal.

The raver-couple chick see her boyfriend kissing the massage guy and runs to the bathroom to cry, her boyfriend follows her and tells her that he's not gay, and of course they get back together and go back dancing, then when the partys done the raver-couple dude sees the massage guy and tells him ""I'm not gay"" and the massage dude replies ""Nah, me neither"".

this movie acheives what it sets out to be, a feel good movie about the rave culture.  for other rave kids out there, yes i know that this movie isn't overly realistic, but it's not real life it is a movie.  they are just trying to make a slick little movie about an undergound party, not a documentary about the party culture.  yes human traffic is a better movie, and a little bit closer to real life (especially for those of you that live in europe) but this movie is good for different reasons.  it reminds me of just starting out in the scene, and the (some say overly cute) ending reminds me of the feeling raves give you, especially at first.  the kids documented in human traffic are a little bit farther down the line, the kids in groove are still way out of the jaded raver territory.

overall, this movie probably won't change the way you look at life, but it's worth watching for sure.  so just take it for what it is.  another reviewer on here wrote that the american scene is all about doing ""cool dance moves"" and ""looking cool"".  i think that's a funny comment coming from the european club scene (and ironically no one really dances very cooly in this movie)  i liked this movie when i first started going to parties so long ago, and i like it now.  quit your bitchin.",1107561600,5,1564,4.311643835616438

I understand the effort in trying to capture the elements of the underground culture to those not familiar with the seen would be challenging and it was valiant effort but it feel flat on its face. Cheesy ethereal talk while high on ecstasy, lame sub plots litter the storyline, and nauseating lines like ""we don't stop till the last record spins"" ...come on, who says that. The director really had a chance to touch on some of the spiritual benefits of taking drugs but again choose uninspired topics , at least give us some thought provoking dialog PLEASE if your not going to focus on the music.

There are some nice tracks on here, its nice to see Digweed as a cameo, and the visual elements are right on. My advice is to take the 20$ you were going to spend on this movie and buy the soundtrack or buy a roll, grab some friends, head to the city and experience it first hand for yourself.

The movie is about the underground raver scene in San Fransisco, and the young people who like to party. There were small storylines through the movie, that were engaging and interesting to watch. Maybe the movie isn't a perfect reflection of the rave scene, but it was an interesting movie nonetheless, and many of the ideas presented were very interesting. The story actually surrounds a guy who is new to the party scene, which is an interesting way to look at it. It was overall a feel good movie.

I think maybe this is the american take on what the party scene is all about, looking cool, using the latest buzzwords, doing some 'cool dance moves', wearing baggy pants, did i mention looking cool? Yeck.
The plasticity of this approach really turned me off, because this is not what the dance scene is all about. Its about leaving your ego behind when you go out.
The film has some interesting ideas, don't get me wrong. But it looks a little contrived when comapred to 'Human traffic'

1366323,4,B00004WM3E,"First the criticism: this movie is so chock full of stereotypes and - believe it or not - cliches, it isn't funny.  From the opening of the bay door in the beginning to finding electricity that works to finding cops who let you rave on, it never lets up.  But, then again, that is from the point of view of what makes a 'good' movie.
Now for the good news.  If you've been a raver, wanna be raver, pseudo raver or someone just curious, it's all about the music, the groove and freeing yourself through dance.  This movie rates way high for all of the above.  The movie is just a vehicle to showcase the music.  You've got more cliches - the wannabe DJ (why is it that he looks like DJ QBert?), the crazy haired chick DJ, the geek DJ and John Digweed making a (great) cameo - all spinning music.  Again, while they are caricatures (even Digweed, a caricature of the superstar DJ), they are vehicles to the music.
Showing this through the eyes of an uptight business writer was relatively clever but all of the other characters are pretty much uninteresting.  I didn't really care a whole lot about what was up.  Perhaps you'll find yourself in some of the types.  Overall though, they - and the rave scene as a whole - come across as a bunch of drug using, sensation oriented, can't get high enough bunch of people.  Perhaps this is more true than we care to admit.
If you've been to one rave or been to a bunch of raves, you'll find yourself right back there and feeling that urge to move.  In all honesty, though, I could've left the movie behind and stuck with the music and the visuals.  But sit back, watch and smile, and have some fun.  Just don't expect much depth.
By the way, 'the end of rave culture' simply means that once something pure has gone mainstream, it is on the decline.  When mainstream books and movies find their way into a large audience it has become - and this is a negative - popular.",1065744000,3,1911,4.328651685393258

Groove is set in SanFrancisco, the dirty metropolitan area blends to make a gritty dark film with the light of children in all there wickedness.
Basically its about a promoter of the rave scene that has lot's of friends and is trying to throw the ultimate underground. There are a few setback's in his journey. The place where they picked for the rave was perfectly set in a dark warehouse district with a police station only blocks away. One of the main characters has never done ""E"" before and he is persuaded to go. In doing so he meets a beautiful raver girl that shows him life from a different perspective.
Maybe it's because I grew up like the film portrays kids. It just brought me back to the badness of childhood in all its splendor. All of the character development is awesome and they are all fighting there own problems in different ways.

The highlight of this movie would definitely have to be the John Digweed performance scene. If anyone has ever seen Digweed live, he is absolutely phenomenal.

You want to see some young adults totally get stoned out of there mind and some crazy DJ's just killing everything. That's what it was meant to be, and it's best like that.

Did she accept Colin's bisexuality? Did they break up? So many unanswered questions. The scene between Colin and his brother is really confusing and pointless too. The portrayal of a rave is nicely done though, if you've never been to a rave, this movie will make you understand why you don't ever want to go.

Terrific amounts of people show up, dance, have a good time... the extras dancing in such shots probably had a better experience making ""Groove"" than audiences will have watching it.
The film tries to break new ground with its focus on the lives of various individuals throughout the rave, giving us a glimpse of the so-called underground of such parties. I've been to such parties, and have had more fun than I can remember, but in watching ""Groove,"" I felt like I was missing out on the fun and excitement, rather than enjoying it.
Beginning with the aforementioned sequence of events, the movie then takes us to the actual party, during which various DJs will play various amounts of music, though most of which quickly grows exhausting as it plays during most of the film's moments. It also takes a look at various people, like a novelist who spends the night getting to know a girl completely out of his league, a young couple who come across complications in their relationship, countless drug abusers, and a gay couple who spend the whole night trying to locate the party, but doing little else.
The film makes the big mistake of giving us absolutely no reason to care for any of these characters. In fact, their existence in the film seems more like an excuse for the various shots of bright-colored hair, strobe light dancers getting their groove on to the endless music, all thanks to some chopping editing from director/writer/editor Greg Harrison, who seems to have little concern for giving any of these people some plausible amount of emotional depth.
Harrison seems more adept at creating the rave scene with striking authenticity, and he accomplishes this with attention to small details through the music and through the use of drugs and mind-bending substances. For this, ""Groove"" is admirable, but without any story to back up this solid sense of style, it quickly becomes monotonous, and I lost interest.",1006646400,3,2159,4.869565217391305

But I consider that to be ""Hollywood Magic"".
 In response to some of the other reviews I've read:  Don't expect a movie to be true to life no matter what its about.

I mean if you wanna see a REAL Rave, you can only do one thing.. GO!! ..Its not a movie you can watch.. its an experience, and I'm sorry, but Go was NOT that much better.. But just like Go this movie is more than just the party, its about the characters, and seeing the party from all those different points of view.. I thought the movie had a lot of good underlying messages... (Especially the good karma at the end thing.. ^_-) (Plus if you pay attention to the characters.. i.e. follow them from leaving home to returning.. you notice some pretty interesting things.. I don't wanna give anything away, but the one angry anti-plur sorta guy.. watch and see what happens to him by the end of the movie..)
The main character is absolutely David.. This is his FIRST party and he is more than a little out of his element.  However, I want to clarify that he was not unknowingly dosed... like some poor mistaken individual wrote in their review... No one ""slipped"" him anything.. He took whatever he took himself.. And I have to say the emotions and actions he goes through are identical to someone simillar in real life going to their first party... And I have seen stranger things than John Digweed ""showing up to a wharehouse party""... Who do you think brought most of those people to that party?...  And for whoever said shame on Digweed: Shame On YoU!.. I think his cameo appearance was great.. Especially the scene with the young and aspiring dj snaz.. Even though the set may have been little excessive.. I mean there will probably never be a party with a living room, massage room, main room, and God.. How many rooms did they have??...  But you get the point.. you're usually lucky if there is more than one room some places.. However, wouldnt it be phat if such a venue did exist?...
I don't think this movie is to help people understand the rave, I think its more for party kids than anyone.  However if society MUST have a look at this ""so-called"" underground scene.. then I think this rose-colored version is a good one to show them.

I wish it could always be, but of course the scene is constantly changing...I think it's VERY unusual to find a TRUE promoter(as in Groove) for an -underground- these days, which is the key to bring the culture back home.  I read a review that said they didn't know what a wherehouse party looked like, or didn't capture the vibe or soul....well, I am a San Francisco native and that is how the party are(were) here....Watching the kids go to the 'EndUp' Sunday afternoon where all the tweekers hang after parties was killer!  I really liked the fact they did NOT show any kids over-dosing or a mass of kids looking totally spun...now that's something that would be taken from Dateline or please Hollywood...Yeah, it sometimes happens, but for the true kids, that's NOT what it's about. There's  music that takes your mind, body & soul to another level,meaningful friendships, new found love, and discovering that life is soo precious and beautiful, being closed minded could be hazardous to your health...Definately a collectors item!",982713600,21,1132,4.9162303664921465
1366353,1,B00004WM3E,"By reading the title of this review, I know that declaring this low-budget, Sundance Film Festival entry the worst is a bold statement (after all, Freddie Prinze Jr. did come out with a few movies last year), but after going to the city's local artsy film theatre (yes, you that read correctly) to see a film that was supposed to depict kids, like me, who don't exactly relate with the hundreds of teenage flicks (""She's All That,"" ""Clueless,"" etc.) that come out each year.  Well, walking out of the theatre, numerous violent images came into my head, directed towards the people in the theatre who were telling me how ""tight"" the movie was, the pseudo-ravers who I happen to run into everyday, and the makers of this film.
Like watching a train wreck, I viewed ""Groove"" once more afterwards, with the security of a stop-button in my hand (and the fact that I get free rentals for being an employee of a video store).  The DVD isn't half-bad.  But...it does nothing to change my already-negative opinion.  (""Fight Club"" however converted me thanks to the DVD).
Well, on to the review.  The makers of this film act as if they have been to one party before and have watched hundreds of Dateline specials about the film.  They try to capture the essence of the rave generation by putting some psycological meaning towards it.  They also poorly capture the feeling of being at a rave.  I felt like I was watching an electronic special episode of ""Days of Our Lives.""  ""Dawson's Creek"" would have captured the scene better (and I hear they have tried).  Each of the characters are one-dimmensional and say the most absurd dialogue throughout the film (remember the conversation where Steve Von Wormer talks about 'The Nod'?).  The actors are all under-trained, especially the young woman who catches her fiance kissing another guy.  I didn't waste any of my brain to remember her name.
For a truly painful experience, enjoyed only by those who either don't have any knowledge of good filmmaking or who feel that they are going against their generation by disliking the film, see ""Groove.""",981849600,2,2084,4.774373259052925

This movie is not only a joke as a film, but a sorely depressing step backwards in trying to inform many people about a culture that they don't understand. To start with the film itself, technically this film is almost laughable from beginning to end. As a fellow cinematographer and longtime veteran of the party scene, the visuals were a complete travesty. And the dvd includes a commentary track by him, although I have no idea why. The cinematographer along with Greg Harrison show that they obviously know nothing about how a real underground warehouse party looks, or the vibe and soul that the culture breathes. And despite what another reviewer said... if you're loking for a truer visual representation of the scene, then go rent GO...., which has a much truer sense of the visual style. And This movie went to Sundance....AHHHHHH!!!!Doesn't anyone else see a problem with this movie? And another thing, I seriously doubt that at a warehouse party with about a hundred people there.. that John Digweed is going to show up... Yeah keep dreaming candy kids. The plot is completly disinteresting, with carboard cut out characters with inane kidlike dialouge left to describe the scene to people who are unfamiliar with it. This film is just a vehicle for Greg Harrison to showcase his connections within the scene, and Digweed, shame on you for involving yourself with such a shoddy production. Someday a good film will be made about the scene that does justice to it, and I hope that people involved in the scene worldwide will show their objection to being portrayed in a kidlike shoddy film that doesn't even get the candy culture right.. come on and how hard is that...

The storyline is simple and the fact that the main characters are two people who are ambivalent about the rave experience makes the movie more interesting than following a bunch of gung ho candy ravers.  This isn't Scorsese's take on the rave world - it's a very well-made independent film that successfully captures the *feeling* of a rave.",980812800,,591,4.412844036697248

This movie wasn't choppy or shaky but instead a very smooth ride with good unknown actors and a script that unfolded nicely.

This is not a documentary style movie: it's an actual movie, with an actual plot, that revolves around one rave in the San Fran area.  The best thing about this movie was the character development. It wasn't a case of introducing one character and then following him/her around for a while, it was more brief encounters with multiple characters, to keep the audience guessing, and also to keep them interested. It even accurately portrayed real-life problems of underground raves, such as police, late-arriving DJ's, excessive drug use, and even the odd DJ-mishap. Obviously, Digweed's set at the end of the Movie is nothing but pure bliss: the defining moment of the movie, and the defining moment of an entire generation.

1366377,3,B00004WM3E,"This Sundance fave is basically 48 hours at a San Francisco Rave. In the 60's there were `Happenings', in the 80's there were house parties, and in the 90's we have Raves.  A lot of Raves are run by folks who merely want to throw the best dance party you've ever been too.  They aren't interested in getting rich from Raves or running an underground version of Studio 54(though some people exist that try).  There's a sense of community and a shared joy of the driving beats of the electronic, techno music that takes the old Kraftwerk sound to new heights of....  Well ecstasy ... as in the drug of course and very popular among Ravers.  So it nitrous, as in laughing gas.  So are power drinks-vitamin/fruit juice concoctions.  So is bottled water-drugs and fast dancing can dehydrate you, you know.
Groove is about an Underground Rave party. We briefly meet a handful of character types who plan on going to the Rave.  Some behind the scenes at the Rave, and then various characters interact at the party all night long RAVE.
There's five main characters in the film, a half dozen minor ones and some extras. Rave promoter (Steve Van Wormer) approves the location, coordinates the fast make-over of the warehouse into a party palace and later diverts a nosy policeman, re-organizes a Rave part 2 and keeps a handle on a potential drug overdose.  He does it not to make money, but for `the nod'. Which is a sincere genuine appreciation from at least one person who has attended the Rave he's organized.  The word that a Rave is on is spread via, e-mail, and personal messages among a cult group of Ravers alert attendees.  Party goers will meet a guy in a car in a quiet part of town, pay a couple bucks  and get directions to where the Rave is being held.
David (Hamish Linklater) is a technical writer whose ready to write his first novel. His younger brother Colin (Denny Kirkwood) is an experienced Raver who insists  insists David (who's a Rave virgin) go with him to the latest Rave. David really doesn't want to go, but Colin tells him it's important he is there because he wants it to be a very special evening him and  his girlfriend (MacKenzie Firgens).  It's no surprise he intends to propose to the girl at the Rave.
There's also Leyla (Lola Glaudini), a New York woman, new to the Bay Area  who's not found a focus or purpose in her life yet, even though some of her former wild party friends have settled down.  She's a 90's version of a grounded 60's flower-child, 80's new-ager. She dresses borderline goth.  Eventually she'll make an impression on David with her exotic look and help him have a pleasant and safe experience after he takes Ecstacy with his brother and girlfriend.  A romance blossoms.
Anyway, that's about all there is to Groove.  That is its charm.  There isn't a lot going on.  A handful of characters interacting at an underground Rave. It's told from the perspective of Ravers and so we see the lighter, kinder side of Raves.  There's no anti-drug messages here and there's a very naive youthful idealism emanating from the writer/director and the characters we meet.  There's a nice tight, semi-documentary type style employed by first time feature film director Gregory Harrison (who's done some documentaries).  His actors aren't very experienced, and at times this really shows.  At times the script is downright corny and loopy.  Some of the comic moments (particularly with the gay couple who are late and get lost on their way to the Rave) are forced and don't work very well.
The music is the a mix of mostly `house' type techno music.  We see real life dj's spinning some grooves during the film.  There isn't any exciting choreography or show-boat dancing going on in the film.
If you want a fairly authentic look at a mellow RAVE happening, this film gives you that with some cliched characters, corniness and hardly a negative message spoken. It's almost pro-drug and glamorizes drug use somewhat with a couple of messages about being careful and responsible about what you take and with whom.  The film is far too safe to get excited about on any level.  It purposely is ambiguous about any possible purpose it might have other than.. Here's a Rave... they aren't wild orgies or places where everyone goes nuts using drugs, but they are young people hanging out, unwinding, experimenting a bit and moving a bit to loud music.
A nod and a shrug.  It's an okay film.  2 and a half stars rounded up to a 3.

1366378,5,B00004WM3E,"""Groove"" is the amazing directorial debut of documentary filmmaker Greg Harrison, who masterfully captures the life of several young adults in the underground raver community in San Francisco. Visually stunning, highly addictive rave music, and an excellent script and cast, the film ""nearly jumps off the screen,"" as a writer for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine described it.
The film's cast which includes Rachel True (""CB4""; ""Half-Baked""; ""The Craft""), Denny Kirkwood (""Never Been Kissed"") and Steve Van Wormer (""Idle Hands"") are all fantastic, as well as the many actors who were casted via casting calls in the San Francisco area. The appearance of many popular rave/techno deejays such as DJ Polywog and DJ Digweed also add realism and authencity to this great film. However, the two scene stealers in this film have to be Lola Glaudini who plays ""Leyla"" and Hamish Linklater who plays ""David"" a workaholic writer who can't seem to enjoy a good time. Their encounter, and instant romance was the film's main subplot, and it made the film a feel-good movie at the conclusion. Ms. Glaudini who has appeared on television's ""NYPD Blue"" is one of today's talented young actresses, and after seeing her in this film, I anticipate a promising career in the near future.
Just like the film's tagline, ""Are you feeling it?"", I definitely felt the force of this independent feature film. When I read that the Catholic Archdiocese of New York City classified this film as morally offensive, I ran off to see even more so, however I found nothing offensive about it. As a Catholic, I probably will be casted to hell, however if so, I have no regrets in seeing this film. If you liked the film, I highly recommend its' soundtrack as well.

1366381,3,B00004WM3E,"The movie from a storyline standpoint is intruiging since there aren't many movies of this sort to choose from in the ""electronic dance"" (rave) scene. The movie is pretty short, although that isn't the real problem with it.
The actual dialogue between the characters seemed a bit forced, such as the exchange between the promoter and one of his buddies who questions why he goes through the hassle of putting parties together anyway. Other aspects such as acting, and I hate to pick on the DJs but snaz and digweed seemed to me like they were trying to act as DJs, not actually being them, slowed the film down a bit.
The energy brought into Leyla's character was a nice boost to the movie, and the scene where Dave is outside beginning to feel the effects did make me feel a bit queasy :)
The film did a good job on trying to develop characters throughout the party instead of developing them beforehand and watching how they react to the different situations that occur. A nice twist since there have been many times where me and my friends will go and be completely open with people we've never met before. So, the film kind of caught a special element of the scene, which was a nice plus.
It seemed most aspects were covered in the movie....there were the candy ravers, the kid who just went so he could take as many drugs as possible, the guy who goes solely for the purpose of hooking up, the first timer, the sober veteran who watches after the first timer, the happy-yet-really unstable raver girl, the ravers who go just to hear their favorite DJ, and of course, the DJs themselves. Some of these characters were developed and represented nicely, but as noted before some of the lines they were fed seem to be more pointed towards people who have no idea what goes on in the scene...a ""How to..."" if you will.
Another neat aspect of the movie was the actual switching of the DJs themselves, and how they all had their own styles to bring. There was Snaz, who at times did a good job of representing the DJ who had to get the music going before the partiers had arrived, made some rookie spinning mistakes when they did come, only to give way to crowd-pleasing DJs who have an enormous amount of confidence in their abilities. A particular interesting turn came for Snaz, who had to perform an anxiety-riddled second set because another one of the DJs had a serious problem which prevented him from going on.
I'm glad the DJs themselves got their deserving chunk in the movie, since they are an ever-growing phenomenon in the industry. When Polywog turned up the volume during ""Twenty Minutes of Disco Glory"" at the build-up point, it reminded me of everything that is fun about the dance scene in general.
To summarize all this non-sense.....this movie could have been made better, but not all groundbreakers are masterpieces. If you've never been to a rave before, this would definitely be an interesting one to check out. If you have, it makes a good start to a collection that will hopefully grow as more and more people realize that the underground-yet-coming-up dance scene offers much more to the mind, body, and spirit than TRL on MTV ever will.",976060800,36,3161,4.6063829787234045

It seems impossible to give this movie a good rating because of this fact. Because of the lack of money that was thrown into this movie, the overall tone felt very cringeworthy.

It is really a shame, because lead actor Hamish Linklater puts in a rather solid, believable effort here.

Starting out in warehouse parties as a teen and moving on to become a party kid, DJ, bringing top DJ's to my town with a production company started by close friends this really captures it all.
Seeing each character is like a part of me/us through those years, from the first party, to the party kid, to the DJ mixing Vinyl, then helping on with promoting I've had all these moments. Meeting famous DJ's (like the young DJ meets Digweed) was spot on in this movie, the best are humble which Digweed captures by giving Heaven Scent. I still have my Tech 1200's and 1000 records but the scene could never be like this again it seems. So glad a film actual ""got"" what it was really all about, people and great music. I never carried a disco ball on a train but remember being part of a great group of people who really wanted to make sure people had a good safe time, now I admit being jaded, the music and magic gone, the feeling of happiness not because of money throwing parties (we only aimed to break even) but getting the ""look"" which was worth everything and most of the scene now is music that sounds like crap (suck-step) this film is like a time capsule back to a great time in my life.",1466380800,5,1348,4.26953125
