8360644,4,B002B41L0Q,"I have tried some of instructor Bernadette Giorgi's Pilates DVDs, so I thought I might enjoy this one as well, especially given that I enjoy both Pilates and ballet workouts.  This DVD is subtitled as being for ""over 50"" fitness--I'm 47, so I figured that I was close enough.  Giorgi leads a group of four background exercisers who do appear to be in their late 40s or 50s.  These women are fit and performed the routines well enough, but I found them to be oddly unsmiling and somewhat mechanical in performance during the workouts.  I was also thrown a bit by the setting, which is a large, airy space with ersatz barn doors to one side that I've seen in other fitness videos, usually cardio-type ones; this type of studio just did not seem to fit with the more relaxed vibe of this barre and Pilates routines presented here.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:  Introduction (a brief overview by Giorgi) - Form Pointers - Workout 1 - Workout 2 - Premixes - Credits.  In the Form Pointers segment (10.5 minutes), Giorgi uses one of the background exercisers to demonstrate some of the main moves used in the routines, including 1st position, 2nd position, 4th position, 5th position, and tendu.  I have described each of the additional segments in greater detail below.

WORKOUT 1
This workout is approximately 40 minutes long.  It starts with a warm-up (about 3 minutes), which consists of simple pli&eacute;s and side stretches.  Centre barre is next.  These are traditional ballet moves, although an actual ballet barre is not used.  Rather, Giorgi takes you through sets of pli&eacute;s and relev&eacute;s, working from the various ballet positions.  In-between every set, Giorgi cued two grand pli&eacute;s as a ""rest""--these began to feel somewhat tedious.  However, I enjoyed the balance work, which included develop&eacute;s to each side and combination moves.  The next section was weighted work, or centre ball.  Giorgi and friends use a weighted ball, sometimes in one hand, sometimes in both hands.  Although I actually have a small 4-pound medicine ball, I found it easier to use my 2-pound ""s-shaped"" weights, as I could use these in either one or both hands depending on the exercise.  There is about 20 minutes of Pilates matwork, and then a brief stretch concludes the workout.

WORKOUT 2
The second routine is very similar to the first, starting with almost the same warm-up.  The centre barre segment is a bit more intense here, although again, Giorgi includes the two grand pli&eacute;s between sets, which slows down the workout.  She performs full pli&eacute;s with cat stretches in-between as well as develop&eacute;s with kicks forward, a nice move requiring balance.  The center barre work is fairly short (5 minutes) and includes compound moves such as lift front with lunge, triceps push rear, side pli&eacute;s with high bicep curl, and alternating side balance (no weights).  There was a similar Pilates matwork segment (again about 20 minutes), and the short stretch including just a few moves such as Mermaid, a twist, and a heel stretch, bringing the total workout time in at about 37 minutes.

As noted above, this DVD has several premixes.  These combine various segments of the two main workouts as follows:

ATTITUDE BARRE, 37:40 minutes
warm-up, Workouts 1 & 2, Centre Barre Work, Stretch

ATTITUDE BALL, 24:10 minutes
warm-up, Workouts 1 & 2, Center Ball Work, Stretch

ATTITUDE MAT, 31:00 minutes
warm-up, workout 1 & 2 mat work, stretch

ATTITUDE ADVANCED, 68:00 minutes
warm-up, workouts 1 & 2 all sections and stretch

Overall, I did like these routines.  There are several things that make this DVD worthwhile, including the variety of ballet moves and the premixes.  However, it could have been better--although Giorgi is a good instructor, she does not mirror cue here, and her background exercisers are unenthusiastic at best.  Furthermore, while this workout is gentle, it is also extremely low energy--it would have been nice if Giorgi had taken things up a notch.  So, I would recommend this DVD, but my final rating is limited to 3 1/2 stars.",1445731200,,4115,4.97510980966325
8360645,5,B002B41L0Q,"Bernadette Giorgi: Attitude Ballet Pilates is a great workout for recovery days or if you want a nice feel good workout that is not strenuous.  I really enjoy this workout, because she fuses Ballet, Pilates, light resistance training, and stretching in one workout.  Whenever, I do this workout I feel like I have worked my whole body without much effort and I find myself more relaxed and centered.  I highly recommend this DVD for all fitness levels.",1444089600,,452,4.8441558441558445
8360646,2,B002B41L0Q,"I don't get the draw of ballet based exercise or maybe it was just this DVD. Okay the exercise participants were all older women like me, but so much plie/knee work. My knees can't take a lot of stress and though the plies weren't stressful there were a lot of them, and then up on the toes. I just found it to be too much focus on work that was somewhat stressful for my knees. I just want someone to teach me a nice clever dance. That's why I like Jennifer Gallardi, but the dance DVD I got from her was still a bit too difficult, because the dance is pretty fast and I can't do the moves that quickly without hurting myself. I am not realy interested in learning ballet and I am not into fitness DVD's either. At this point my favorite is still Michelle Lamour's Tease and Tone--her exercise sequence is perfect. I also still like lady Morgana and her private dancer DVD's",1440201600,,875,4.27710843373494
8360647,3,B002B41L0Q,"This workout is  gentle and mild. It touts itself as being geared towards women over 50, and that's probably an appropriate assessment and won't disappoint unless you're used to working out to Cathe, Bar Method and Tracy Mallet DVDs. It doesn't compare to those in terms of  physical demands. I didn't really break a sweat, and found her voice pleasant and relaxing. The DVD does offer the option of a lower exertion workout if that is what is needed during a busy work week. Light weights are used but most of the repetitions are done quickly and no moves are held so I question the effectivemss of the toning  and I don't expect any soreness from these exercises the next day.-- However it's better than doing nothing on low energy days and it does slightly energize you and does increase your flexibility. The style and exercises are similar to what you get in Ballet class, but less rigorous.  The Premixes are convenient. I did the most challenging option for 68 minutes yet felt like I had an easy workout, but at least I worked out on a day where all I felt like doing was curl up and take a nap.",1358467200,2,1103,4.472636815920398
