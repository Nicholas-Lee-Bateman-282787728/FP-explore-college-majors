3423668,4,B00195I3OA,"Me gusto mucho esta Edicion en Dvd de esta Telenovela, la verdad que contiene lo mas importante, toda la escencia de la Novela, y las Mejores Escenas, sobretodo las peleas de Valeria y Marcia, y todas la maldades de la villana, entre otras cosas. Los Extras son Exelentes, tanto las entrevistas como los promocionales y demas, estan muy buenos. Lo que no me gusto es que no tiene la Entrada de la Novela, con la cancion Tierra de Pasiones, si contiene las escenas cuando Valeria canta Necesito tu Tierra y la musica de la cancion de fondo en varias escenas y obviamente cuando la canta en el Final. Lo que si note es que faltan unas Escenas muy importantes como son, cuando Jorge va a la carcel, que se vuelve loco, y Marcia va a verlo a la Carcel y luego el se suicida, cuando Marcia se le aparece, en el Dvd queda como que se fugo luego de dispararle a Pablo y a Marcia y no volvieron a saber de el. Falta la escena cuando Valeria se pelea con Marcia en el gimnasio y Marcia le dice que no la provoque porque ya no sabe si los golpes que le da le duelen o le estan empezando a gustar. Y tambien falta cuando Marcia mata a Lulu, que la atropella con el auto. Tambien note que no estan todas las escenas donde aparece la ex de Francisco y la relacion que Andres tiene con Alex, si bien al final se ve que estan juntos no muestran las escenas en que ellos 2 se juntan y demas. En mi experiancia personal, compre este Dvd en una tienda de discos, aqui en Uruguay y me vino fallado, totalmente rayados los discos y el final nunca lo pude ver, lo cambie 3 veces por 3 iguales, cerrados, sellados y me paso lo mismo, al punto que terminaron devolviendome el dinero porque no habia ninguno de los que estaban en stock que estubieran bien. Pero al comprarlo en Amazon, ese problema no lo tube, al contario, vino bien, los discos sanos, no estaban tan rayados y se ve el Final, por suerte, aunque el Disco 1 del Lado A y del Lado B, los ultimos 5 minutos se tranca, de ambas caras del Dvd, y el Disco 3, en el Final de la Telenovela, justo en la Escena Final se tranca tambien, hay veces que se ve con normalidad y otras en las que se tranca en ciertas partes la ultima escena, pero despues anda todo sin problemas.",1287705600,,2207,4.195294117647059

3423673,2,B00195I3OA,"Hola!

Me faltan las palabras, creo la novela esta buena pero como puedo saber, ninguno de los discos funciona perfecto,por el final se faltan 20 minutos, el disco 1 lado 1 no se ven las ultimos 20 minutos(mas problemas hay pero no me recuerdo todo, pero son muchos), siempre se para la pantalla, no sige el disco.
Me e pasado horas con limpieza de disco, pero todo por gusto!
Tengo la solucion, pero esta mala!
Creo telemundo pienso estos 4 discos y la novela eran de oro,se protectan las discos con una pila de sectores rotos, cuando uno se puse el disco en la luz se ven los errores en los discos, demasiado errores por los apparatos de DVD y computadoras
Tengo dos aparatos de DVD, en ninguno funcionan perfecto mucho menos en el computer!

Mi ideomas de ingles es mal, pero los dos gentes de arriba escriben de los mismo problemas, entonces no es casualitad",1221609600,,862,4.519230769230769
3423674,3,B00195I3OA,"Rec'd today, 7/28 from Amazon.  This is one of my favorite and most well done novelas - quality is really good.  Won't say much about the story line; love in the vineyard - overall, a pretty good story line.  However, the mix of South Florida and traditional wine growing landscapes has given me whiplash.  Was hooked when it aired, and looked forward to the DVD...as with most other novelas (Cuerpo , Pasiones, etc.) it is heavily edited - to the extent that some of the story is lost.  As of today, 8/1 - I am on my 2nd set of DVDs from Amazon, disc 1, chapter 3/4 does not seem to work for me (original and replacement set.)  A double sided manufacturing method was used, it is hard to figure which disc is which.  I expected that the DVD would have some great added features - since the broadcast version was very well done; noticeably absent is a cut of Gabriella Spanic's vocals on the theme.  Unfortunately, that was not part of the special features - so if you're looking for her to sing Necesito tu Tierra - you're out of luck.  I find it disappointing that the producers: 1) did not add enough special features, 2) was too heavy handed on the edits.  Out of the 4 discs (double sided) the 2nd side of Disc 4 is blank; 2-3 more hours of the story or in added features would be great.  DVD - rated 3 stars; but don't get me wrong - the show is great.",1217203200,10,1358,4.245136186770428
3423675,3,B00195I3OA,"I was really bummed about the DVD, I ordered it and had replace DVD sent. I also had issues with Disc one, and most importanly Disc 3 which had the ending--which kept locking up in three different DVD players I have in the house. So, I never saw the ending.

It was a beautiful story....
Necesito Tu Tierra is the CD Sound track.

In a beautiful valley where the most exquisite grapes are farmed, an intense and sizzling love story will flourish between Valeria San Roman, a beautiful woman with a strong character, which has given her the strength to face life's deceptions, and Francisco Contreras, renowned publisher, widower and a man of will.

Valeria, who manages the San Roman vineyard, hasn't had an easy life. Her own father, Jose Maria `Chema` San Roman, the family's patriarch, has always hated her because she is the only one who doesn't obey him. A man without scruples, selfish and womanizing, Chema arrived to the United States, married Valeria's mom to steal everything from her and later disposed of her. If that weren't enough, Chema schemes a hideous plan causing Valeria to experience a horrible betrayal.

Meanwhile, Francisco arrives to visit his father at the ranch only to learn that he has married Marcia, a woman much younger than he who leads him to the brink of bankruptcy and drives him to suicide. At that time, Francisco decides to stay in the valley and save the family business from bankruptcy.

When Valeria and Francisco meet, their strong personalities undoubtedly clash, although it is evident that there is a strong chemistry between them. They team up to form a partnership convenient to both and are resigned to the idea of having to put up with each other. As they get to know one another, a love stems between them that will survive all the challenges they will encounter along the way.

But, when destiny finally gives Valeria this new opportunity, Pablo, an old flame she thought was dead, comes back from the past to change everything.",1213142400,4,1980,4.7748538011695905
3423676,1,B00195I3OA,"I just tried to watch this DVD tonight and couldn't because the first DVD is damaged. It becomes distortioned almost immediately, and it turns black and sends me back to the beginning of the DVD. It is very frustrating because when I tried to watch the second side of the first DVD, it's too advanced and I had to stop it because I didn't know what was happening because I couldn't see the first side of it.",1443916800,,407,4.298701298701299

3423679,4,B00195I3OA,"Tierra de Pasiones (Land of Passions - 717 minutes)

Here is a classic dysfunctional family. Chema (Hctor Surez) the father, is a hateful wealthy widower, his son Jorge (Sergio Catalan) is a would-be author, the soon-to-be-married daughter Valeria (Gabriela Spanic) manages the vineyard and the wine-tasting room but Belinda (Graldine Bazn) her illegitimate daughter, has been raised to believe Valeria is her older sister, NOT her mother. When Valeria discovers her father paid a man to marry her, she is furioso. so she derails the wedding in a way that is most hurtful to her groom and her father.

She no more than gets her life back on track when she meets the man of her dreams. Despite avoiding romantic entanglements for the past 20 years, she KNOWS that Francisco is the one. They soon announce their engagement only to have Belinda's handsome father Pablo (Francisco Gattorno) turn up, still in love with Valeria after 20 long years. He has been accumulating wealth so he would be worthy of her when he came back.

I enjoy seeing uncommonly smart people see through the many devious plots and love the many rounds of Who's Your Daddy? The evil Marcia (Catherine Siachoque) never quits seducing and conniving; she proves over and over again that there is no fool like an old fool. She is a cold-blooded killer almost as heartless as Chema! Chema is smart, ruthless and very very clever. Watch his jailbreak!

Both of our lovers have trouble with their offspring: general misbehavior like drugs, alcohol, promiscuity and AIDS.

The happy ending came unexpectedly at the end of Disc 3 but I had one foot left in the air because neither of the villains were satisfactorily punished so their stories aren't resolved. There is a Disc 4, but it consists of interviews, bloopers, bios, etc., none of which have captions.",1411171200,,1822,4.883495145631068

3423682,1,B00195I3OA,"I just ran disc one and the disc skips and stops and completely shut down my blue ray player so I switched to another machine. Same problems on side one and side two of disc one. Could not get the gist of the story due to the skipping and unwatchable stops.
I tried to send it back but Amazon told me was ONE day past my opportunity. With the number of Novelas that I have ordered I don't see how anyone can watch them in a month. This one is worthless and I am forced to throw it away with no replacement. I am in the U.S. and my machines are set for this disc so their help in the message was also worthless.

Since I have no other options, I will have to say I will not purchase from this provider again unless they want to step in and take care of the problem.",1383264000,,764,3.9290322580645163

3423685,5,B00195I3OA,"i love watch this telenovela...i like see Gabriela spanic and saul together again and they play the character so well, especially gaby.
the story is great.. the shooting location, the vineyard is faboulos. i never seen any telenovela shoots in vineyard before, makes my own excitement to follow the story. but too bad they compress the story from 170 episode if not mistaken become only 4dvd, for me its too short and too much important story been cut like the death of Lulu (valeria best friend), the death of Jorge (the brother) and more too mention.
i hope for next time, amazon or whoever publish the dvd can consider not cutting too much, im sure we are don't mind to pay more if we can get what we are expected.

From all the other comments I've read it seems to be a big issue, hope the manufacturer re-edits the novela on better quality discs and equipment.

8272105,2,B00195I3OA,"I was really disappointed when I began watching this DVDs because Disc 1 has manufacter problems. I thought mine was damaged, but I read here that many people had experienced it. This isn't one of my favourite telenovelas and I didn't watch it a lot when it broadcasted, but I love the actress who plays the main villain, Catherine Siachoque, so I bought this DVD to remind her and her character. I haven't yet finished the first DVD because I've encountered problems, but it's nicely shortened. You don't have the feeling there's missing pieces, especially if you hadn't seen it earlier.

I don't recommend this DVD for buying because it isn't worth and you'll have problems with watching the beginning. Unfortunately, I can't return because I bought it a few months ago, but just now had time for watching it.",1453334400,2,811,4.792857142857143
