8610800,5,630500501X,"I LOVED this film. I watched it with a bunch of college friends and we couldn't get enough of this thing. It's going to become a cult movie because you either love it or hate it. It was so over the top and but really funny at the same time that I've taken to saying some of the dialogue in my regular conversation.  It had gore, humor and awhole lot of good looking babes. I wish more low budget flicks were this good. Buy it but just be prepared for a really different kind of film.",1032307200,,483,4.03125
8610801,4,630500501X,"""Feast"" is without a doubt the single worst ""film"", and I use the term loosely, that I have ever had the misfortune to spend money on. It is sadly dated by the costumes and vehicles worn and driven by itsinadequate cast of pseudo-actors.
The film quality is deplorable, it appears as if the reel sat in the corner of some cutting room floor for a decade before some schmuck decided to release it.  The dialogue is terrible, and is forced at best.  Whatever credibility or semblance of a plot that this movie had went straight out the window as soon as it broke into one of its several confusing and totally unnecessary soft-porn scenes.  Granted, I enjoy gratuitous nudity as much as the next guy, but this was completely ridiculous.
The only memorable scene comes with 4 minutes remaining and is only worth mentioning because of the corniness and stupidity with which it is delivered.  It is obvious that the director has no respect for his audience.
In closing, I cannot rate this ""film"" with any quantity of stars, it is beyond my comprehension as to how anyone could willingly release something of this calibre on an unsuspecting public.  The cast and crew of ""Feast"" should not be allowed into another studio, I strongly urge you to avoid wasting your time and money on this, or any other collaberation of these so-called ""film makers"".",983750400,,1341,4.713675213675214
