As a Washingtonian, it felt like it was a bit of a love letter to my city which may be a part of my appreciation for it.

7599802,5,B01AFGSSWU,"I truly enjoyed the film. I like those Before Sunrise types of films...I think it shows the flaws, vulnerability and insecurities we all have in the choices we make with respect to our relationships. Keep up the good work Harold Jackson III.",1457308800,2,241,4.761904761904762

7599806,4,B01AFGSSWU,"I like this movie because it left one's imagination to what happens next. it was not SEX.

7599811,4,B01AFGSSWU,A good movie that dealt tastefully with serious issues. It's never easy to end or start a romantic relationship and knowing when/if to end it is sometimes dicey. Good acting. Good movie worth watching!,1511222400,,201,4.9411764705882355
7599812,5,B01AFGSSWU,"I liked the story of two decent people just not being right for each other, but figuring it out in time. Meeting more compatible people along the way was a difficult situation, but that's the only way you know for sure. Showing white men/black women relationships always draws more scrutiny and I liked that this was handled with aplomb. There were no ""bad guys"" here. Everyone got a happy ending. Casting was good, the story was tasteful and layered with a lot of nuance. I enjoyed it and have watched more than once.",1510963200,,518,4.580645161290323

7599821,3,B01AFGSSWU,"I enjoyed this movie.  The slow-moving pace allowed the viewer to observe the development of the two main characters. Best part was nothing was sexual. The chemistry developed over time because of quality conversation.  Both needed each other to be the sounding board so that each could close one door to accept another.
If the story was just about them, I would rate 5 stars but the 3 comes because the focus was not even. The fiancee was struggling as well and a little more time could have been spent developing his character.  He was  searching,  looking for answers to what his future should be. He asked  family  and fruends for answers. When he saw an old friend the complexity of the relationship wasn't brought to life in the film when it should have.",1503532800,2,760,4.626865671641791

7599823,4,B01AFGSSWU,"I quite enjoyed this. I'm also quite picky. It's not outrageous, it's not big budget, there aren't any animals or cute kids or over-the-top finales where someone shows up in a stunning evening gown and perfectly coiffed hair and the jerky guy suddenly melts into a puddle for the quirky woman who blossomed into a centerfold - as if that's the only thing that women are good for. Anyway, I digress. This is what happens when people don't quite fit together and things get complicated. It's sweet, and it's slow, and it's better than some of the films that get a lot of money and big names thrown at them.",1502409600,2,604,4.5
7599824,5,B01AFGSSWU,"Even though the beginning and music were bad, I LOVED this! Great story of two people crossing paths. ""Know what you want, and don't get in your own way...""",1501027200,,156,4.413793103448276

7599826,5,B01AFGSSWU,"Beautiful movie! I loved everything about it. A tender sweet story of love without sex just hearts connecting,  the music was also perfect. This resonated with me because I lived this story. My husband and I met and he proposed after a week and three weeks later we were married.

7599834,5,B01AFGSSWU,"I am an action movie kind of guy, so was reluctant about watching this movie... I loved it.  Yes, it moved slow, but that is the point, and it was delivered so well.  The actors were very believable and I couldn't help but be drawn in.  I was telling myself that this movie is so sad and I was hurting for every one involved, but the ending was both a surprise and a relief.  If you are looking for something a little different, then this is one well worth watching.  It will not disappoint.",1493942400,2,491,4.180851063829787

7599839,5,B01AFGSSWU,"I wasn't sure I would like this, but I am glad I watched it.

This is probably one of the best romances you can see on film.  It has some flaws, but not enough to get in the way of what it delivers overall.  There are layers of the characters, issues and situations that are brought on as you watch. Because of this, and what the actors put into it, you start caring about the characters.

 It is interesting to watch the natural progression of the resolution, and you have an overall satisfied feeling as the credits roll.

If you like romantic movies, this one is for you!",1489881600,3,574,4.268518518518518

7599843,5,B01AFGSSWU,As someone who lives in DC this movie managed to capture the feeling of the city! It is a great love story. There is such a great chemistry between the actors. I could watch this again and again.,1488585600,2,195,4.157894736842105
7599844,4,B01AFGSSWU,"I loved the story line and characters.  They were well developed and took time to know one another... and, yeah, it was all in one day.  It wasn't fast tracked, which was very refreshing.  They had deep conversation and light intimacy.  Very good movie.",1487635200,,253,4.681818181818182

7599846,4,B01AFGSSWU,I really enjoyed this movie! I loved the characters and how it lightly delved into thinking about why we make the choices we make and should we rethink those choices. Lovely romantic movie!  Some people may find it too slow.,1487116800,,224,4.6

7599854,3,B01AFGSSWU,"I liked this one.  The guy has just enough quirky depressiveness and sincerity to come across as a genuine character with some depth, even somewhat bearable at times.  The girl however makes the movie watchable as she is very charming and believable.  The intermittent slow points weren't too bad until they got to the nightclub where it was pretty much filler space with this side character singing several songs in a row.",1485216000,,423,4.847222222222222
7599855,4,B01AFGSSWU,"I liked the two leads, although the heroine came off as a bit wishy washy at times. Both the hero and heroine came off as complex and three dimensional.",1484697600,,152,4.275862068965517

7599858,5,B01AFGSSWU,I absolutely loved this film. I often search for films that reflect interracial/ mixed relationships and this was a beautiful story. I liked that it was a blooming love story. No sex no profanity.  It was perfect. Just s beautiful romance.,1484352000,,239,4.829268292682927

7599861,2,B01AFGSSWU,"The little movie that could...it's difficult to pull this genre of movies off; I get it,  however, I feel this movie lacked in believability.

I wasn't looking for Shakespeare but give me a break.",1484265600,,342,5.314814814814815

7599864,4,B01AFGSSWU,"I liked this movie, it is just a nice romantic story, nothing graphic or violent  just a sweet story of a one-day love affair, if you can call one day an affair, so it is a movie that makes one feel good about live and love.",1484006400,,224,3.869565217391304
7599865,5,B01AFGSSWU,"I knew nothing about this film, the story, or the actors, so this was lovely. It felt very real and completely plausible. There are no villains or heavy dramas to deal with in the story, which is about transitions in life and about finding your way through the challenges. I have been in similar situations where the experience of meeting someone new was not the headlong rush to a preconceived goal. It was, instead, an easygoing journey in discovery with little to know pressure. And, what pressure there might have been, was often internal as it bumped up against where I was and where I wanted to be but had not yet made a change.

This is definitely one of the best feeling movies I have seen in a long time where everyone is ""a nice gal/guy"" just finding her/his way at this specific time. I also loved the ending, which was foreshadowed a bit at the beginning, yet does not provide the usual predetermination of everything that will happen. Loved the actors who felt very real in their situations and enjoyed their friends also feeling real. Even when changes are made, they are made with thoughtful deliberation and kindness.

Definitely recommend if for an enjoyable evening.",1483833600,2,1184,4.714975845410628

7599880,4,B01AFGSSWU,"Last Night  is a perfect couples movie because it will have couples questioning if they have chosen the right partner. It is hard to make an interracial storyline seem authentic, but Jackson accomplishes this feat. Gavigan and Blair definitely have chemistry because at no point did I feel the relationship was forced. It seemed very natural from start to finish. This movie reminds me of a 2016 version of Before Sunrise.

I love the fact that it takes place in Washington, D.C., because I am tired of movies taking place in L.A. and NYC. The only thing that seems off is Blairs role as a fashion model. Her character would have come off more believable as a fashion photographer, but her career didn't take away from the storyline.",1480204800,2,733,4.71875

7599904,5,B01AFGSSWU,"It's really nice to see non-political Washington, DC get spotlighted here. Also as a former Raleigh resident and a soon to be DC resident, I really appreciated the connections between the two areas and I saw myself in both of the main women profiled as romantic interests. There are lots of positive representations of black folks. All the other characters interacted with them in very nice, equal and respectful ways, even though it dealt with what would be on the surface a black woman choosing a white male over a black one. However, the final decision was far more nuanced and dealt more with content of character, without blaming or slamming anyone for their decisions.  Also, nice to see folks who appear to be in their late 20s at the least, maybe even late 30s, have feelings and also be seen as normal having these conversations.

Great camera work and I got really homesick for both places, which I think means you did well. A great movie for girls night in, self-care night or maybe even date night.",1472860800,4,1010,4.668539325842697

7599935,4,B01AFGSSWU,"The meet, walk around the city, fall in love/angst all in a day is a crowded genre with a lot of excellent films (Before Sunrise; Top Five; Medicine for Melancholy...). This film has a tendency to reach too far for two types of conversations: ""deep"" talks about life/love/the city and meaningless conversations that let the characters laugh and connect. (Staples of the genre!) In this movie the deep didn't feel deep and the meaningless wasn't funny or enlightening--I just felt ""so what?""
I give 4 stars instead of three because the cinematography was beautiful, the cast did a good job (they were also beautiful).

Last Night has believable chemistry between the main characters and (what the two others I listed lack) a satisfying story from beginning to end with. The pace is slow but compatible with the story line. I was Very happy with the music and the fact that the writer gave me a reason to invest time with these characters from the beginning of the movie and didn't just string me along some random day with no purpose or no satisfying conclusion.

Playin' it safe may work for many, in fact, judging by what we all see everyday and the complexities of living in the 21st century, the vast majority of folks, play it safe. I get it, life is hard enough and who has time to listen to their spirit, heart, gut. So, the vast majority take safe jobs, make safe relationships, safe life choices....blah, blah, blah....All of which is BORING, UNINSPIRED, LIMITING. This is a movie for those who step-out of their comfort zone, challenge the moment and go with something new, different, but inspired. The pace of this movie will undoubtedly bore many it isn't filled with action, but thinking and reflection. If you like these types of movies and want action, see ""Something New,"" with Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker or ""Last Day Without You,"" with Ken Duken and Nicole Behari.

Bravo, well done... MORE like this - because THIS looks like the real thing. The acting... was soft, smooth, real and easy to sit and take in. I really liked that. They actually looked NATURAL and real together. Serious double thumbs up!",1462492800,26,720,4.034965034965035

7599992,4,B01AFGSSWU,"Last Night was a lovely movie, romantic, understated and altogether a very different movie to watch.  No Hollywood nonsense, just an almost perfect little gem of a movie.  The music played was a component of the movie, not a loud bothersome noise in the background.  The music itself was like an actor, played well and worked well into the movie itself.

Watch it, it's worth the time spent.",1461801600,5,391,4.705882352941177

8747245,4,B01AFGSSWU,"Beautifully filmed, slow moving, not at all a cliched rom com. The writing was spot on. Its a slow burn; you develop a fondness for each character as the movie progresses.
