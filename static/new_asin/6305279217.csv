1002489,1,6305279217,"I remembered this movie from daytime HBO in the early 80s.  I was on a forum and we were discussing favorite martial arts movies, and I suddenly remembered this ""classic"".  A poor man's(dirt poor, bordering on destitute) version of Enter the Dragon, it has average martial arts until the very end, when there are a couple of good scenes in the final arena battles.  When I saw that it was on DVD, I immediately ordered it.  The movie was just like I remembered it, and it is worth the $10.  However, the print of the film is very poor, with certain parts very grainy or dark.  The character of ""Gorilla"" played by Ken Grampu has no distinguishable facial characteristics at times.  There isn't even a menu on the disc - both the quality of the disc and the quality of the print make it like you are watching a 20 year-old VHS tape.  Plus, there's a picture on the back of the DVD case with two women (one of them with her shirt open and black censor circles over her nipples) that isn't even in the movie.  By all means get it if you remember this campy classic and your VHS has worn out.  My one star rating on this is for the DVD itself, not the movie.",1070841600,9,1154,4.252293577981652
1002490,5,6305279217,"This is a classic martial arts film. If you like the energy of any of Bruce Lee's movies and in his way of life , you'll surely appreciate James Ryan. It is just one of those films that bring you back to a special time in your life, where martial arts was magical. It doesn't rely on special effects like all the cheesy films today ...Matrix etc, it is just hands down martial arts combat - no frills! Any true martial artist can appreciate this film, they just don't make them like this anymore. I love this film, alway's will. It was the very first karate movie I ever saw and I never forgot it even after years of not being able to find it I could vividly remember the names like the Fly and Hot Dog and of course Steve Chase - the perfect martial artist's name!",1049846400,2,765,4.175675675675675
1002491,5,6305279217,"James Ryan, along with world-renowned martial artists Norman Robinson and Stan Schmidt, take you on a colorful excursion filled with fighting, fun and excitement!

In this 1981 Ivan Hall motion picture, Marduk is a megalomaniacal billionaire who develops a syrum that bends people to his will.  He has sequestered himself in a remote area along with thousands of followers who hasten to implement the syrum into the world's water supply. Steve Chase, four-times martial arts champion, is hired by the government to thwart Marduk's grand scheme. Chase is accompanied on his mission by four of his old companions: The Fly, Gypsy Billy, Gorilla, and Hot-Dog.  All four of his companions are a joy to watch, each with a charisma, skill and personality that is unique to themselves and truly colorful to watch.

""Some of the best martial art action sequences ever""?????!!!!! Thats like comparing They Call Me Bruce to Drunken Master. James Ryan and his cohorts pull off martial arts stunts that are sadly, probably near the skill level of any overweight 10 year old.

1002494,4,6305279217,"A scientist has discovered how to convert potatoes into fuel, however an unfortunate by-product is a mind control drug. Marduk, an evil madman kidnaps the scientist, and plots to take control of the world by tainting  the water supply with this drug. Leaders of the free world approach Steve  Chase and his band of elite mercenaries and hire them to free the kidnapped  scientist, destroy the mind control drug, and rid the world of the evil  Marduk. This martial arts adventure stars James Ryan as Steve Chase,  martial arts champion and leader of the elite mercenary group. The  mercenaries consist of ""The Fly"" (Stan Schmidt), a martial artist  who has reached the esoteric heights of martial learning; Gypsy Billy  (Norman Robinson), ""ex-champion of the world"" and reluctant  derelict; Gorilla (Ken Gampu) former pro wrestler banded for biting the ear  off defeated opponents; and Hot Dog (Bill Flynn) con artist and comic  relief. Joining this group is Kandy Kane (Anneline Kriel, former Miss  World), the supposed daughter of the kidnapped scientist Dr. Kane, later  exposed as an agent working for the government. Chase and his team  infiltrate Marduk's compound, known as the ""New Babylonia"", but  before they can liberate Dr. Kane and destroy the drug, they are discovered  and taken captive. Each member of the team must face one of Marduk's karate  trained soldiers, with Chase facing Marduk's ""champion of  champions"", the ""Optimist"" in a battle to the death.  ""Kill and Kill Again"" is a feel good action/adventure that the  whole family can enjoy. This movie is a tongue-in-cheek swashbuckler that  sometimes pokes fun at itself.

1002594,4,6305279217,"Before watching Kill And Kill Again, the sequel to Kill Or Be Killed (which I haven't seen), Id suffered through three productions by Edward Montoro: Day Of The Animals, Grizzly, and Mutant. Each film left me with that unpleasant feeling in the pit of my stomach that started cropping up sometime in my late twenties: the knowledge that Im definitely going to die one day, that feeling that life is short, and the suspicion that  partially because of movies like the three aforementioned  Ive all but wasted my allotted span hitherto.

So its not difficult to imagine my mindset when Kill And Kill Agains opening credits rolled, and there was Montoros name plastered across the screen. Id already paid good money for the thing, which represents work and arguably falls into that time-wasted category. Then again, if I watched what I was sure would be an atrocious movie, that would be another couple hours of my inevitable race to the grave spent on yet another horrendous Montoro film. Do I cut my losses now, or truly shame myself by letting Montoro fool me a fourth time?

Obviously I chose to watch it. Buried beneath my existential nihilism is, in fact, an optimist. My findings?

You heard it here first: Kill And Kill Again is kung-fu gold.

Well, ok, silver. But for Monotoro it might as well be platinum.

Its obvious he missed his calling: after watching three of the worst horrors ever shot on film, I watched Kill And Kill Again, an eighties kung-fu flick, and realized Montoro as a producer missed his calling. Dont get me wrong, derivative still (as always) applies, and I cant judge whether Montoros was intentionally satirical  maybe my modern sensibilities mistook an actually genuine attempt at a serious kung-fu movie for a tongue-in-cheek romp  but maybe, just maybe, Montoro (without a miraculous accident) actually turned out exactly the sort of film he wanted to make, and it was actually good.

James Ryan stars as Steve Chase, a world-renowned martial artist who (presumably in the first film) is no stranger to getting dragged into contests of a nature thats decidedly more lethal than your average cage-match. Model/beauty-queen Anneline Kriel plays Kandy Kane  I swear this isn't a skin-flick  who drags Chase on a quest to save her father, whos been abducted by the evil genius Marduk. Together they assemble an A-Team style crew of the usual typecast-oddballs and token-whatevers, who set out to karate-chop and roundhouse-kick their way to Dr. Kane.

Marduk  whos as comically villainous as youd expect with a comic-book name like that  kidnapped Dr. Kane to work on his latest mastermind scheme for world domination. Hes cooked up a potato-based obedience serum, and needs Dr. Kane to perfect it. Seriously, hes taking over the world with potatoes, and if that isn't intentional comedy I don't know what to call it. Marduks got an entire campus full of brainwashed youths already on the drug, who hes raising as his personal karate army. Once Marduks plan ripens (heh, get it, because potatoes?) hell enthrall the entire world, assuming Chase, Kane and their sidekicks don't stop him.

Nothing about this movie, when viewed superficially, should have been enjoyable. Its got a white South African, James Ryan, all but parodying Bruce Lee (I could never figure out whether I was supposed to believe Ryan was actually Asian). The voice-acting sounds like a racists interpretation of Native American mannerisms. Sexism is blatant, even for an eighties movie, although Ill give Montoro this: Kandy Kane is a far more active heroine than any of his others female leads. Shed critical to the plot, in fact, and gets in a few badass moments herself.

Kung-fu movies have a reputation for being cheesy and over the top; its an inverse relationship between the realism of the kung-fu, and the awesomeness of the movie, and Kill And Kill Again wisely doesnt deviate. Theres an obvious bit of realism beneath the choreography, but their ultimate goal was entertainment rather than believability. Its got everything weve all come to expect from these sorts of martial-arts movies: spinning kicks, backflipping as a valid means of daily transportation, parkour inspired wall-flips, and outright absurdism when it comes to how many (supposedly well-trained) combatants our heroes can fend off and defeat all on their lonesome.

As a matter of fact, Kill And Kill Again broke new cinematic ground, which isn't something I thought Id ever say about a Montoro production. My jaw literally dropped a couple inches when I saw it. Youll recall the slow-mo spinning-bullet shots in The Matrix,  Im sure; turns out KAKA was the very first instance of that now iconic shot. Even more impressively, they accomplished it all without the modern technology The Matrix and other imitators relied on. A dolly, a camera, some plexiglass and clever lighting were basically all they used for the setup.

Innovation? Montoro? My core beliefs are thoroughly shaken.

Kill And Kill Again is, slow-mo bullet sequence aside, nothing new. It isn't plowing deep into fresh narrative territory; the minimal character development isn't masking any biting social commentary; the cinematographys impressive, but its an action movie, so I expect nothing less.

But its fun. Its enjoyable. You can laugh at the over-the-top kung-fu (or karate, whatever its supposed be). You can dig the eighties nostalgia which is ultimately the genres hallmark. You can turn your brain off, kick back, and prepare to be entertained with the comfortable knowledge that Kill And Kill Again won't require an iota of your upper-level cognitive function to fully enjoy what it has to offer.

And, like me, you can say you finally watched an enjoyable Montoro film.",1473292800,,5731,5.034883720930233

1002599,3,6305279217,"Where to begin.  I think you classify this under 'I loved it when I was a kid but...'  So I fondly remember seeing this when I was young.  My friends and I watched it over and over on cable and even then we laughed at it's campiness but still had a great time.  I remember it being a surprise sleeper hit that year hitting like number 2 at some point.  That same year, Ebert and Siskel did a special episode listing the movies they were embarrassed that they liked, and 'Kill and Kill Again' was among their selections.  I hadn't seen this film since those days of early 80s yesteryear, so when it popped up on my Amazon recommended list, I bought it right away.  Watching movies based on childhood memories can frequently be a disappointment, and this one had it's ups and downs.  But either way it was great seeing it again.  So many things I thought I forgot but were brought back one cheesy scene after another.  I really enjoyed seeing all the camp again, and it looks like the crew had fun filming this movie.  The one thing that disappointed me was the poor choreography in the fights.  Some were good mind you, but others were either planed poorly, or executed poorly.  A surprising aspect, given all the martial arts talents in the cast.  With many martial arts films, you can forgive a bad story or poor acting if the fight scenes are good, but if all are bad, then you just have a bad movie.  This isn't awful camp, just not as good camp as I remembered.  But I'm always happy to take another ride down memory lane.  Even if the ride isn't that great!",1429488000,2,1562,4.349480968858131

1002729,5,6305279217,"In the early days of Home Box Office (HBO) ""Kill and Kill Again"" was shown frequently.  Being a huge fan of martial arts movies I jumped at every chance I had to see it.  My brother and I enjoyed it every time.  When I learned the movie was finally available on DVD I immediately ordered a copy.  It was great to see this chessy and stupid movie again!

In the movie James Ryan plays Steve Chase.  A four time World Martial Arts Champion who is asked by a woman named (I'm not kidding.) Kandy Kane to help find her father, Nobel Prize winning scientist Dr. Horatio Kane (John Ramsbottom.  The creators of ""CSI:  Miami"" must be big fans of ""Kill and Kill Again"" too!).

While working on an experiment to create fuel from potatoes (How cornball can you get?) Dr. Kane discovered a powerful drug that can be used to control the minds of humans.  A reclusive billionaire named Wellington Forsythe, III (Michael Mayer) has somehow or another learned of this drug and decides to use it to create his lifelong dream of a perfect society.  With the help of legions of followers, Forsythe kidnaps Dr. Kane to have him mass produce the drug.  Though it is never explained just how, Forsythe manages to administer the drug to the citizens of an isolated town named Ironville.  Since Forsythe considers himself a Babylonian God, he changes his name to Marduk.  To keep with the Babylonian theme, Marduk changes the name of the town to New Babylonia.  Marduk rules the town with an iron hand.

The drug can only be injected.  Marduk has forced Dr. Kane to create a serum form of the drug that can be taken orally.  Marduk's plan is named ""Operation: Water Supply"" in which he hopes to dump the serum into water supplies all over the world to expand his empire.  Kandy Kane, with the help of some wealthy backers, asks Steve Chase to infiltrate New Babylonia, rescue her father and destroy the drug before Marduk can put his plans for world domination in motion.  Chase agrees, but demands he assemble a team of old friends to help him on this dangerous mission.

As I mentioned before ""Kill and Kill Again"" has a lot of flaws, mostly with its script which is loaded with cornball dialogue among other things.  However what makes the movie work well enough to be entertaining is its cast.

James Ryan is quite good as Steve Chase.  He does have a strong presence on screen that makes him believable in his role.  Ryan is also a great athelete.  His martial arts sequences are well staged.  His best being the climactic showdown with Marduk's invincible martial artist known as The Optimus (Eddie Dorie).

The late Ken Gampu is also very good as Gorilla.  He has many good one liners and does not take his role too seriously which makes him even better.  I especially liked Gorilla's scene in which he prevents Marduk's escape in the helicopter.  Awesome!

Stan Schmidt and Norman Robinson give very good performances as The Fly and Gypsy Billy respectively.  They are not the best actors in the world but they do well enough to get by.  Like Ryan their martial arts scenes are thrilling and very well staged.  Robinson especially.

The late Bill Flynn provides the comedy relief as Hot Dog.  Like the rest of the cast, he does a very good job given the script they have.

""Kill and Kill Again"" is cheesy to the extreme.  It strectches implausibility to the limit.  That aside it is very entertaining and quite fun to watch.  Like Marduk, I command you to buy or rent ""Kill and Kill Again"".  You won't regret it.",1365379200,2,3497,4.574193548387097

Main Feature
------------

The movie itself is what it is. You're either a fan or you're not. Other than the new screen format, there is not much in the way of improved quality in the look of the film. In fact, at first viewing, I wondered why everyone appeared to be suffering from mild sunburn.

The overall color balance of the image appears weighted toward red.

Admittedly, the original 4:3 DVD print is probably likewise graded a little too much toward blue, but still preferable to a lobster-skinned film cast.

At first, I thought perhaps it was just a case of shoddy grading.

Surely any professional grading software could easily color correct the new print better than what we see on the new DVD release.

But then a little research on the term ""InterPositive"" could explain the reddish grading:

""An interpositive, intermediate positive, IP or master positive is an orange-based motion picture film with a positive image made from the edited camera negative. The orange base provides special color characteristics that allow for more accurate color reproduction than if the IP had a clear base, as in print films."" (Wikipedia)

Still, whether intentional or an unavoidable part of the process, the red/orange hue is distracting.

In particular, the reddish grading clashes horribly with Marloe Scott-Wilson's neon pink coiffure.

However, the grading issue is not a deal-breaker. The fact that the title was chosen for re-mastering and re-release at all is a testament to the cult following the film has built over the last 30+ years. These days, no media company does anything unless it promises profit. Although there's currently not a widespread fan-base presence on the web, the sales records must speak for themselves.

So, fellow fans...enjoy our beloved ""Kill And Kill Again"" in all its new widescreen HD glory!

This proved an interesting feature I have never encountered on a DVD release before. Upon first discovering the release and reading the content description, ""isolated music track"" led me to believe a single musical selection from the soundtrack would be made available--possibly with an identifying title.

Actually, ""isolated music track from the original 3-track Mag sound"" means the entire music/sfx track played in sequence and timing of the film (I believe ""3-track Mag sound"" refers to a 3-track magnetic sound recording, similar technology to what eventually became known to consumers as 8-tracks).

Choosing this bonus feature means you will be watching the movie with no sound except that of the music and some sound effects.

Audio interview with star James Ryan
------------------------------------

Who couldn't like James Ryan? The guy is so genuine and sincere. If you can look past the fact that the audio quality is just a half-step above two soup cans connected by a string, this little commentary by Ryan is a gem.

Hearing him talk about everything from his affection for the cast to production of the film to his own experience in acting and martial arts adds a new dimension to the ""Kill"" franchise.

Like with the isolated music track, you will be watching the film as James Ryan gives his interview (oddly, a one-sided interview as you can't hear the interviewer--presumably producer Walter Olsen--but you can hear Ryan responding directly to questions).

Just a heads up, the interview ends about the time the team arrives at the Wildwood Saloon, but the film will continue to play normally to the end if you wish to ride it out.

On camera interview with writer John Crowther
---------------------------------------------

Simply stated...what the [heck]?!

Either the camera settings were completely out of whack or the interview team decided to rely entirely on natural daylight to shoot the segment and clouds kept passing in front of the sun that afternoon.

The 24-minute interview might be a bit more enjoyable without the distraction of the image continually changing from light to dark.

Nevertheless, writer John Crowther shares some truly interesting anecdotes about the creation of the the film and reveals a curious, albeit slight, relationship between ""Kill And Kill Again"" and ""The Magnificent Seven.""

Original trailer
----------------

Nothing really notable about this particular feature other than it starts right off the bat with the now famous ""bullet time"" sequence. Groundbreaking for its time, it was clearly a proud accomplishment for the production team.

The trailer is nice to have as part of the overall collection for posterity. And it's always enjoyable (for me, anyway) to compare the movie trailers of yesterday with how they're produced today.

Conclusions:
------------

Overall, this is a nice DVD for fans of ""Kill And Kill Again"" to have in their possession. The playback of the new format should work well with today's widescreen HD televisions. And possibly, the orange-ish nature of the InterPositive print could be corrected by adjusting your television's color settings a bit to compensate.

Compared to the first DVD release which had no bonus features, and not even a menu screen, the 30th Anniversary Special Edition is a jewel!

Could it have been better? Absolutely. Could it have not been produced at all? Absolutely.

Again, the fact that any media company decided to pick up the title and incur the production expenses of re-mastering and compiling additional content speaks to the number of us who know this film, love this film, and continually seek out more and more about this film.

1002787,3,6305279217,"When it comes to ""Kill and Kill Again"" several things about the movie are crystal clear. The plot and dialogue are totally laughable. The acting is really stiff and the special effects if you can call them that, are cheesy at best. Somehow this film still managed to entertain me despite all its shortcomings.

There are a number of elements in the film that appear to be taken from earlier films like Enter the Dragon, Hot Potato and Death Dimension. I've already stated that the acting is poor and the plot if you can call it that, is laughable. Make no mistake, this is a low budget 80's action flick with a cast of virtual no names with the exception of James Ryan. There are a few good fight scenes, but most of the fight choreography is poorly staged. As for the villain Marduk and his super fake beard, there's only one thing missing. Jim Kelly shouting, man you come right out of a comic book!

Four time martial arts champion Steve Chase leads a group of mercanaries on a mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist from the clutches of the evil billionaire Marduk. The kidnapped scientist Dr. Horatio Kane, no relation to Horatio Kane of CSI Miami; has developed a formula to turn potatoes into fuel and Marduk has discovered a more sinister use for the formula. The formula can be used to alter the minds of humans, so Marduk devises a plan to dominate the world with the aid of his elite army. The only thing standing in Marduk's way is Steve Chase. Will Steve Chase rescue the scientist from Marduk? Does Marduk have another surprise in store for Steve Chase? You'll have to buy your own copy to see how this one ends.

When it comes to releasing old films on DVD, there's a new player in town. Scorpion Releasing is responsible for the 30th anniversary DVD of ""Kill and Kill Again"" and overall, they've done a pretty good job. It states that the film is being presented for the first time in (1.78:1) anamorphic widescreen from a brand new HD master; from the original interpositive.

I'm not an expert on video remastering and I don't know what kind of restoration if any went into the new HD print. I can tell you that the picture is clear and viewable, but the new HD print still contains embedded artifacts and speckling throughout. The colors are pretty good for the most part, but there are some scenes where the colors appear washed out. This is probably the best this film will ever look and sound. There's not much in the way of bonus material for this 30th anniversary DVD release, I expected a bit more in the way of bonus material. If you're a fan of this movie, you'll want to add this DVD to your collection.

1002826,3,6305279217,"In recent years, ""Kill and Kill Again"" - the action opus of South African karateka James Ryan's solo career - has gained a cult following as one of the cheesiest martial arts movies ever made. A sort of early&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>, you could say. Unlike that one, however, it doesn't hold up as well as a legitimate martial arts film as it does an unintended comedy piece. I can see some action fans finding a niche in this one's surreal goofiness, but I found myself falling asleep at intervals for the lack of actual thrills it offered.

The story: a team of combat specialists is assembled by champion fighter Steve Chase (Ryan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer-5-Redemption/dp/B00009MEBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer 5: Redemption</a>) to put an end to the plan of a charismatic cult leader (former child actor Michael Mayer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy/dp/B000TGJ8B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy</a>) looking to brainwash the world into mental slavery to create his own personal utopia.

The plot would shortly after be recycled for the Joe Lewis picture&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Force-Five/dp/B00065AXW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Force: Five</a>, and perhaps the most sincerely positive thing I can say about ""Kill and Kill Again"" is that at least it's not that one. On its own, this is a pretty harmless picture, if only for the fact that it doesn't engage you as actively as other ""bad"" movies. There's a lot of nonsense going on - unexplained levitation, a character who eats cigar stubs (Bill ""Hotdog"" Flynn), another character who rips the door off a bathroom stall when he can't hold his bladder (Ken Gampu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Naked-Prey/dp/B000XPSC0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Naked Prey</a>), the 'potato fuel as mind control' plot point - and while you can expect to be shaking your head in dismay several times, don't expect any laugh-out-loud moments. Part of the problem lies in the insincerity of the performers (excluding James Ryan): in the aforementioned ""No Retreat, No Surrender"", absolutely everybody was putting their heart into the absurdity of the picture, whereas when anybody makes the overhead ""Marduk"" sign/gesture in this one, you can practically see them cringe as they realize their friends and family are going to be seeing them like this.

The fight choreography - being from a time before the '70s standard had been let go - didn't really intrigue me by default, but serves as an interesting study of how the physical environment can positively influence a fight scene. Jet Li and Yasuaki Kurata would later show us in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-Legend/dp/B001AR0D1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of Legend</a>&nbsp;that it's possible to stage an incredibly dynamic hand-to-hand duel on completely flat, open terrain, but in here, things definitely take a turn for the bland once the characters get away from civilization. The first encounter - an impromptu brawl in a casino between Steve and a group of thugs - is positively explosive, with Steve spinning and flipping off the walls, jumping ledges, and kicking guys into a nearby pool. In other words, it's more like a modern-day Hong Kong battle. A lot of the fights that follow take place in areas that are either cramped or completely open, and the choreography is a lot less creative. This isn't a rule among martial arts films, of course, and a few of the later matches redeem themselves through grounded realism, but the added fact that a lot of stuntmen at the time didn't yet know how to properly react to a karate kick makes most of the fights look just plain bad.

The acting is universally poor, and in the end I think that's what most folks are laughing at in this movie. Personally, I don't think you have to look further than any earlier Van Damme movie to get the same level of dramatic mediocrity, but as a cumulative package, this one does stand out more for all-around ineptitude. This is the kind of film you get for a movie buff as a joke gift, so I suggest you use it as such and only go in for the action if you've run out of other material.",1319932800,,4504,5.7380239520958085

The guard fires his gun (at 1:36:10) and the bullet comes out very slowly and moves across the screen in a recognizable (but low-budget) early version of the famous scene in the Matrix. After ten seconds of the bullet flying across the room, Steve Chase has gotten up the building, gets inside the room, and deflects the bullet with a metal ashtray.",1272844800,,633,4.601769911504425
1002829,4,6305279217,"I remember seeing this film as the kids today say ""back in the day"",when 42nd Street was still the deuce. When you could put down a fiver and see 3 features for your money. Usually two martial arts movies and a women in prison flick. For those of you who weren't around to live through the experiance,buy a copy of the Last Dragon and watch the scene when Sho'Nuff makes his entrance. That's truly how movie theatres on the deuce were back then. But I digress. Kill and Kill Again has been one of my favorite western martial arts films since forever. Unlike Enter The Dragon this is a true team-up adventure. Sort of like the western film,The Professionals,but without the guns. James Ryan stars as martial arts champion Steve Chase who is recruited to rescue a scientist who has been kidnapped by a billionaire who has dreams of taking over the world. The scientist has developed a formula made from potatoes that can sap a persons will. The villian also has at his disposal a small army of martial artists led by a Ben Davidson look-alike known as the Optimist. Chase puts together his own team to save the scientist and thwart the villian. This film is great cheesy fun with a plot as Jim Kelly would say ""comes right out of a comic book"".The fight scenes are effective,and lets face facts that's why anyone goes to a martial arts movie. The one negative is the lead character isn't a real martial artist himself. He's a good athlete with a good physique and good screen presence,but you get the impression that just about anyone on his team(especially the characters called the Fly and Gypsy Billy)could take him apart.

1002830,2,6305279217,"Kill and Kill Again (Ivan Hall, 1981)

There are some bad movies I love, and I can't justify my love of them in any way save pure nostalgia. Kill and Kill Again, a movie I was obsessed with throughout my teen years, is one of them. It is, I believe, the first martial arts movie I ever saw; while I have seen many since, some worse, most better, this one holds a spot in my heart that nothing will ever replace.

Steve Chase (James Ryan) is a martial arts superstar who is called upon by the beautiful, deadly Kandy Kane (Anneline Kriel) to save her father from the clutches of the evil Marduk (Michael Mayer), who is planning on releasing a mind-control drug (developed by Kane's father) into the American water supply. Of course, Marduk has leaked all this in order to attract Chase, so he can pit Chase up against his own pet martial arts champion, Optumis (Eddie Dorie). Chase gets together a team of fighters, and off they go to save the world.

It's astoundingly bad, even more so than I remembered. The script is derivative, the acting wooden, the plot convoluted and manipulative. And yet it's a stupidly fun movie to watch, one I could (and have, at many points in my life) see again and again without it ever getting old. Though I grant you, if you didn't first see it when you were young and impressionable, I doubt it will hold the same magic for you. **",1206403200,2,1366,4.412698412698413

Ryan and a bunch of middle-age posers (who seem to think they actually ARE martial artists) race to save the world from an evil madman bent on enslaving the planet with his mind-control serum. Of particular interest is the scene where Ryan stops a fired bullet from killing someone by jumping through the air and intercepting the bullet with a handheld 3"" x 3"" steel plate.

I wanted to second the notion that the DVD version of this film is as good as the VHS version. There are literally no special features and no care taken to create this DVD. The producers of this DVD version did NOT digitally remaster this film; it was simply transferred into a digital video format.

If you really want to see this film, pick up the VHS copy for $5 - $10 and do not get rooked into paying $30 - $40 for the DVD. This flick is worth the view, but since the quality is the same on either format, save your money and go old school.

I suggest checking those cheap-o bins; sometimes you can find nuggets of DVD joy in the unlikeliest of places.
