3064857,5,B0011FLGUG,"From personally suffering from acute to chronic lower back pain, this DVD will help your back/body recover and become stronger. This is an excellent dvd.",1256342400,,153,5.16
3064858,1,B0011FLGUG,"Don't look to this video as ""the rescue for back pain,"" despite its title.

Though the instructor is lovely and the actual footage is shot and edited well, this video is presented in a way that assumes you already know yoga. I offer four primary observations. It is: 1) Not for the newbie  2) Not for the inflexible 3) Heavy on the earthy yoga lingo 4) Not an exercise class or yoga session.

1) NOT FOR THE NEWBIE:
Some of the poses are both aggressive and difficult to understand if you're a yoga newbie. These factors practically invite more pain, because if you don't execute the poses correctly, you will stress your back (like I did).

2) NOT FOR THE INFLEXIBLE:
In addition to her obvious experience, she is also incredibly flexible. So, if you're in serious pain with limited mobility due to your pain or injury, reconsider this as a choice, unless you're willing to watch it simply for infotainment rather than for actual therapeutic guidance. I don't think many people will be able to handle many of these poses.

3) WHAT THE HECK DOES ""FEEEEEL THROUGH YOUR KNUCKLES"" MEAN?
The instructor uses very ""earthy"" language too - ie: ""soften your heart through your upper back"" and ""breathe through your shins"" type of expressions, which yoga newbies a) won't understand b) might find ridiculous.

4) NOT A YOGA CLASS:
Lastly, this DVD isn't an exercise class, per se. It is a demonstration of Yoga poses - one after the next. It's up to you to create a workout or yoga session of your own, using the poses demonstrated.

I am going to return this video. It's not at all what I thought it was going to be.",1232668800,57,1608,4.5625
3064859,4,B0011FLGUG,"I do get some nasty back pain sometimes, the kind where you feel like your lower back is going to snap and it just makes you yelp (or it does for me). So I saw this DVD on display at Borders and thought, why not?
I tried it for the first time yesterday, after several days of being very sore and achy. I had been at least able to stand upright, so I thought I'd give it a try, go easy if I didn't feel comfortable, and see what happens.
Desiree gives an introduction, goes over posture (if you stand in a certain way you create tension in the spine, etc.) and guides you through numerous poses. There is a guy in the background doing modified poses if you're not as flexible as Desiree. Some of the instructions I wasn't 100 percent clear on (I've done a bit of yoga here and there but it's mainly a couple of warmup poses on, say, a Denise Austin workout, or I pull out a deck of yoga cards and try this or that to my suiting - no yogi am I). But the lack of clarity I felt was mainly because I am not used to planting all four corners of my feet on the floor or pressing the thighs against the bones, for example - I'm a thinker but not that profound of a thinker). But I did enjoy going through the dvd. The stretches felt good, for example, just laying down and arching my upper back - making my heart reach to the sky - and the advice was nice, too. Desiree shows wrong postures and poses (like don't point your feet out in this or that pose). But overall I really liked it. It felt good to do the cat, cow, cobra and more poses, and she has you do some strengthening moves, incorporating some crunches and leg raises. Some poses were more intense, more pretzel like, so I just modified here and there. But when I stood up I managed to stand up straight and felt pretty good. Well stretched and less pain.
My only real problem with the dvd (and I only have played this on my mac) is I couldn't access all the individual chapters - I could only get the first half or so, so if I wanted to look at the menu and review later poses by that option, it didn't work for me. You can just fastforward and skip, but I would have liked better menu accessibility. But I feel better today and I'm eager to try it again, so that is worth the money.",1232409600,12,2239,4.067873303167421
3064860,1,B0011FLGUG,This video for beginners is NOT for beginners at all. It already assumes you know Yoga lingo and that your body is amazingly flexible. She doesn't explain anything and the yoga workout is very difficult to follow if you're a beginner who has never tried this before. This did not help my back at all. Very disappointing.,1231632000,6,320,4.631578947368421
3064861,4,B0011FLGUG,"In this DVD, Anusara-trained yoga instructor Desire Rumbaugh offers a yoga practice designed to ease pressure and tightness in the back, improve posture, and increase strength and flexibility to the core of the body.  The Main Menu of the DVD is as follows:  Introduction (brief overview by Desire) - Play Workout - Chapter Index - Biography - Music Options (Music Only or Music + Instruction) - Also from Acacia (trailers of other workouts).  For some of the postures, a block or blanket is used.

Desire mostly leads the workout using voiceover instruction, although she breaks in live at times to provide more specific tips.  The first six chapters (about 8 minutes) focus mainly on the fundamentals of good standing posture.  She then moves through a series of basic standing postures to warm up the back, including chair pose, cat/cow, downward dog, spinx/cobra, and locust.  The lower back in particular is targeted through several lunge variations as well as a seated twist.  Because weak abdominal muscles can contribute to lower back problems, Desire also works on strengthening the abdominal core through exercises performed in a reclined position such as crunches, leg lifts, and pendulum; this section was fairly challenging, especially the pendulum move, which Desire moved through at quite a fast pace.  Next, Desire returns to some additional backbending postures, upping the intensity level with bow, camel, and bridge.  Following this, the practice begins to wind down through a series of stretches, including lying hamstring stretch, outer hip stretch, and windshield wipers.  Desire offers some final postural tips in the reclined position, as she provides instruction on preserving the lumbar curve as well as presents the use of lying over a blanket to restore proper alignment.  The practice concludes with a savasana (relaxation) that is just under four minutes long, bringing in the total time at approximately 65.5. minutes.

Although video this is presented as a complete yoga practice, the mixture of independent short chapters (most are around 2 minutes in length), interruptions for live instruction, occasional lack of parity between voiceover and onscreen demonstrations, and brief ""Tip"" segments which show the right versus wrong way to perform some of the postures all contributed to an overall choppy feel.  The information presented here is certainly valuable, but the stop-and-go nature made it feel more like a physical therapy session or yoga workshop than an actual yoga practice.  This DVD would probably work best for those wanting specific tips and strategies to address back pain rather than a flowing yoga practice experience.

UPDATE 3/2/12:

After I wrote the above review, I decided that I wasn't going to use this DVD very often, and I wound up giving it away.  However, I recently re-acquired it for several reasons:
1)  I have and enjoy Desire's DVD which followed this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-to-the-Rescue-for-Neck-Shoulders/dp/B0021R52IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga to the Rescue for Neck & Shoulders</a>.
2)  In September 2008, I had the opportunity to take a live workshop with Desire, and I found her to be absolutely amazing.
3)  I have had two episodes of low back pain in the past 18 months.

The issues I mentioned in my original review are still present--i.e., this DVD is a bit choppy, as it varies somewhat between a workshop format and an actual yoga practice (luckily, Desire corrects these problems in Yoga to the Rescue for Neck & Shoulders by including separate Tutorial and Practice segments).  However, the DVD is extremely well-chaptered, so in trying it again, I found that I could easily skip the more instructional chapters (labeled ""tips"" on the chapter menu) and focus on the practice-oriented work.

This DVD *is* appropriate for those newer to yoga, although those who are both brand-new to yoga AND currently in active pain should probably look elsewhere for more detailed instruction first.  Also, it is important to note that Desire is a certified Anusara yoga instructor, which means she incorporates certain themes/language such as opening the heart and inner/outer spiral of the legs.  Personally, I love the Anusara style, and I think Desire does an excellent job instructing this DVD.  Because I am still on the tail end of my most recent back pain episode, I skipped some of the backbending work for now, but these types of poses are excellent for maintaining health and strength in the back, and I know I will be doing them again soon.",1207872000,68,4588,5.275103163686382

8241669,3,B0011FLGUG,"I've had this DVD for a long while and I pull it out whenever my back is hurting.  (Thankfully, that is not often.  But it means I forget a lot about the DVD in between uses.  I did try it last night, though, so these thoughts are fresh.)

You will need some props to get the most out of this.  A chair or counter or even a ballet barre (they make some for home exercise use) or just something at a little higher than waist height will be used at one point.  A yoga block or rolled up blanket/towel is also used (you can get by with only the blanket, but if you are using the block, you will also need a rolled up towel or blanket at the end).  A mat is used, of course (if you are working out on carpet that is probably optional).  At one point a folded blanket is used under your back during some crunches.  I skipped the folded blanket.  And although a strap is not used by the demonstrators, I did use a yoga strap during the hamstring stretches.  But I have terribly tight hamstrings and I get better results with a strap.

This is a little over an hour long.  It is not a constant workout, though.  Especially in the beginning, there are frequent stops to talk about technique, posture, etc.  This was a little aggravating to me.  I mean, on the one hand, it is good advice and I should listen and try to heed it.  But on the other hand, I wish this stuff was in a separate section of the DVD instead of under ""play workout"" because I ended up wasting a bunch of set aside exercise time to listen to the instructor talk about (and this is just an example) having a friend watch me walk to see if I turn my feet out while I walk.  Whereas camel pose, downward dog, crunches, hamstring stretches, etc. -- I feel I actually got some immediate benefit from these.

The set is nice and relaxing to look at, with soft light, candles, etc.  If there was music, I already don't remember it, so it was definitely unobejctionable.  The instructor's voice is easy to listen to and she does an excellent job of demonstrating moves (and there is also a man who shows easier modifications).  She seems friendly and pleasant.  (She is, perhaps, wearing a bit too much jewelry.  I tend to think of yoga as a jewelry-free activity.  It can get a little distracting to look at her necklace.)  Sometimes there were moves that were repeated 8 or 10 times.  But the instructor would talk about other stuff and stop cueing and it wasn't easy to see the TV (for example, while on my back) and I wouldn't realize we were supposed to switch and I would end up working one side much more than the other.

On to the moves.  There are backbends (camel, bow, bridge, and locust pose, among others), abdominal work (crunches, etc.), some moves to release the hip flexors (lunges), hamstring stretches, and pretty much every category of move I would have thought of to work on the back.  The focus really strongly tends towards backbends; most of the other types of moves don't get a ton of extra time.  Unfortunately for me, my back pain seems to be more sciatica/tight hamstrings-related, so I would've loved a few more hip opening moves and stretching the hamstrings (for example, seated forward fold or something), as well as something more for the psoas muscle (once I emailed Ravi Singh and Ana Brett and asked about tight hamstrings; they told me psoas work was important and when I did the sets they suggested to me, they were so right -- and tight hamstrings definitely affect the back and posture).  Also, doing 2 sets of 5 crunches each is not enough work for the abs, although in principle, the instructor is right -- you need good core/abdominal strength to help support the back.

In the end, I did get some value out of this (although it did not immediately fix my back pain or anything).  I think I will watch the posture part a few more times, not during dedicated exercise time, and try to incorporate those tips into my daily life.  When I want to exercise and really focus on my back, I will skip to the section with actual asanas and supplement with more hamstring/psoas moves (for example hip raises in bridge pose and the set called ""So Long Sciatica"" from Ravi Singh's and Ana Brett's ""Yoga Quick Fixe"") as well as some additional abdominal work (something gentle, perhaps with a Bender Ball).",1459555200,3,4292,4.424203821656051
8241670,3,B0011FLGUG,"Yoga to the Rescue for Back Pain is actually not a DVD appropriate for people who are currently in pain. This is more the type of workout that is more useful to prevent back pain while you are healthy. I decided to try this DVD when I actually was in pain to see if it would relieve pain. To be honest it seems like it made my back pain worse. I could hardly get back up off the floor at the end.

Now as far as the actual exercises go they are very normal for an advanced yoga workout. This is in no way useful for beginners even though modified poses are shown. To do some of these poses you need to have been doing yoga for years. Yes there are some easy poses like downward dog, lunges, cat/cow, etc. But then there are some lunges with twists that require a lot of balance. Something you may not have while your back is out. Some of the poses are a little ambitious for those half a century young too. The back bends? I'd skip those completely and I didn't do them. There was also no way I was going to be able to do camel pose (keeping down on elbows did help) and bridge in my condition.

What I did really love about this DVD was the music. There is beautiful Indian music, monks singing and what sounded like Tibetan bowls. I'd love to get a CD of the music on this DVD.

So I'd say this DVD is more for preventative care than a ""rescue"" for back pain. This is more about strengthening than stretching.

Well if you are in pain I just don't recommend this. Check with your doctor before doing any routine this challenging. This workout is more for advanced practitioners and will be of interest to those who want a challenge.
