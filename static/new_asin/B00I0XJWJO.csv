8638165,5,B00I0XJWJO,"Very impressed with these licks. I haven't found any ""filler"" licks yet. Lots of Kenny Burrell, some Grant Green and even a Peter Bernstein lick and an Eric Krasno lick. This will keep me busy for a while and expand my soul jazz vocabulary.",1451865600,,240,4.4772727272727275
