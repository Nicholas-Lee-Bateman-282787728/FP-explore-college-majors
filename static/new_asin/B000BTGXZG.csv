2440700,4,B000BTGXZG,"NOTE: Dom DeLuise passed away at age 75, on 5/4/09.

""LOTSA LUCK"" was the second TV series for Dom DeLuise. His first was the self-titled ""Dom DeLuise Show"" from 1968. Dom re-used that same name in '87 for his third and final series. All three programs aired for a single season only.

One element of ""Lotsa Luck"" is reminiscent of Edgar Kennedy's RKO ""Average Man"" shorts of the 1930s and '40s. Here, bus driver Stanley Belmont is unmarried, yet lives with a houseful of dependents: his mother, his sister Olive and her lazy husband Arthur, who avoids work at all costs.

The series was created by Carl Reiner.

Timing is showbiz as in life is critical.

2440701,5,B000BTGXZG,"I remember watching this television series when it originally aired, and was very upset when it was cancelled after the first season.  This is one series that I never expected to see on DVD.  The show is just as funny today as it was when it originally aired in 1973-1974.  All 22 episodes are crystal clear.  The pilot episode, which is considered an ""extra"" is not the same quality as the other episodes.  All I can say is, if you like good old fashioned humor, you will love this series.  ""Losta Luck"" brings lotsa laughs!",1153699200,6,525,4.473684210526316
2440702,1,B000BTGXZG,"I had remembered this show as being really funny when it was first broadcast.

However, I've got to tell you...the first few episodes are brutally bad. I am a big Dom DeLuise fan, but they were totally unwatchable. The episode where Stanley dates the librarian is the first one that's really watchable. They are OK from that point on, but the repititious jokes in every episode (""Do I have a son, or do I not have a son?"") wear thin. The use of the same jokes in every episode reminded me of later seasons of Sanford And Son where the writers got lazy and the same jokes were used over and over to get a sure laugh.

All of the characters, other than Dom DeLuise's Stanley Belmont, are so over the top and unbelievable, it's impossible to connect with any of them. Seriously, his family is so unpleasant, especially Arthur, that it's tough to watch. Even Archie Bunker had redeeming qualities, and they didn't give Stanley's family any. You spend the entire time watching and saying to yourself ""Why doesn't he make Arthur get a job?""

Out of the 20+ episodes in the set, there were a few really great moments...and really all of them were sight gags with Dom DeLuise. When DeLuise is doing the type of comedy as he did in Silent Movie, he's a riot.

For fans of TV from that era, look for Alvy Moore (Mr. Kimball from Green Acres) in a small role in one episode. And, in the second-to-last episode, ""Bummy's Girl"", look for Suzanne Somers as the femme fatale in one of her earliest TV roles.

If you are a HUGE Dom DeLuise fan, this might be worth a look, especially after the first few episodes.",1141430400,2,1597,4.436860068259386
2440703,5,B000BTGXZG,". . . so began the opening theme song of ""Lotsa Luck,"" the Dom DeLuise sit-com that ran on NBC during the 1973-74 season.  This is a very humorous, well written show that showcases DeLuise's comic acting abilities and features a fine supporting cast, notably Kathleen Freeman as Dom's mother and Wynn Irwin as his lazy brother-in-law.  I hadn't seen this show since its original airings and was pleased to see that it still holds up very well so many years later.

The 22 regular season episodes look great for a 30+ year old show, but the series' pilot episode is of lesser visual quality and appears to have been sourced from a VHS tape, complete with some video blips in the early goings and a voice-over promoting another series over the end credits.  Still, I'm happy that the pilot has been included as an extra for the sake of completeness, and even happier that a relatively obscure show like ""Lotsa Luck"" has been given first-class treatment on DVD.  Most of the other extras included on this release from S'more Entertainment include interview segments with Dom DeLuise (he's a great storyteller), but one wishes that an episode commentary or two from Dom were included, perhaps on his favorite episode.

For Dom DeLuise fans this is a must, but those who enjoy classic sitcoms will appreciate discovering or re-discovering this largely forgotten comedy . . . Lotsa Luck!",1139270400,14,1381,4.805907172995781
2440704,5,B000BTGXZG,"It's like welcoming back an old friend. What fun to watch this forgotten show. Loosely based on the BBC-TV program ""On The Busses"", this version was adapted by (among others) Carl Reiner and was Dom DeLuise's first  and only starring role. And it works! You may not know her name but when you see Kathleen Freeman as his Mom you'll recognize her and she is hysterical. Even though watching the episodes back-to-back can make any series seem repetitious, this one has enough laughs per show to make it easy to enjoy. Keep an eye out especially for ""The Librarian"" episode. The BEST!  More of these wonderful  'one season classics' please (""He & She"" anyone?)",1139270400,5,657,4.745614035087719
2440705,5,B000BTGXZG,"This show from the 1970's is very funny. Carl Riener was involved in it, and Dom Deluise is excellent as hapless bus driver Stanley Belmont. I remember liking the show when it was on, so I took a chance on the DVD set. It's definately worth it. There's a little bit of Ralph Kramden in Deluise's character, and the supporting cast is funny as well. If your tired of classic sitcoms you've seen over and over you may want to give this a chance. It hasn't run on TV since 1974.",1136937600,6,475,4.230769230769231

8092314,3,B000BTGXZG,"Lotsa Luck left a lot to be desired.  It was a wanna be All In The Family hampered by cardboard characters and trite situations.  Still I found it growing on me by the end of the 4th. DVD and I was sad that there were no more episodes to watch.  Dom DeLuise and Kathleen Freeman were the standout actors in the series and there were quite a few genuine moments of humor.  Still it had the dourness of 1970s America where the Arab Oil Embargo, raging inflation and the Vietnam War were filling a generation with cynicism (Watergate was looming just around the corner).  Look for a young and luscious Suzanne Somers in one of the episodes.  One running joke that grew tiresome was an exchange between Kathleen Freeman and Dom Deluise (who played mother and son) where anytime she wanted to manipulate him into doing her will would ask him, ""Do I have a son?"" To which he would wearily respond, ""Yes, you have a son"" and give in to her demand.  I never understood why that was a guarantee of getting her way or why it was supposed to be funny.  And to show how much times have changed.  In all the episodes Dom Deluise was sure that at last he was going to have enough money to buy a color tv (but ultimately failing in his objective), something we take for granted in this day and age.  In sum I think Lotsa Luck is a worthy investment of time and money, if your expectations fall in the mid-range.  I like its opening and theme song and am glad I purchased the set after finding out about it on YouTube.",1428192000,,1502,4.290780141843972

8092317,4,B000BTGXZG,"A talented friend of mine, Jack Knight, was a principal player in this series; so I had the oportunity to attend a taping or two. It's a shame it was so short-lived but the timing was probably off - and there wasn't much support from the network. This DVD set is a grand documentation and watching it today, so many years after it's production, it remains surprisingly fresh. I can recommend it to folks who might be familiar with Dom DeLuise, and even those who don't remember him. The whole cast is delightful and there are still lots of laughs in ""Lotsa Luck.""",1290643200,,563,4.475728155339806
