8709389,2,B000062XFX,"Possibly the worst dubbing I've ever heard.. Although I must say the action is constant and throughout and the costumes are adequate however the actors names(Rocky & Willow) and their actions are enough to cause you to seek therapy.  The climax(spoiler) oh soo stupid, consisting of a villian(who youv'e never seen) who for some reason does not know when he's won(but enjoys a good laugh!) and practically begs our dim heros to vanquish his azz. By the by this movie has nothing to do with Shoalin the cover clearly misdirection. Another strange Ocean Shores Joint!",1017878400,2,565,4.947368421052632
