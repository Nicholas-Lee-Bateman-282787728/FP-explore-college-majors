It is full of the much needed information information necessary in considering musical kur.  The only drawback is that one must speak Dutch or read the subtitles. I suppose it is a worthwhile trade for the benefit of experiencing how the greatest interpreter of the musical freestyle develops her work. Embarking on this task is no small job and this product will definitely help cut to the technical details as well as provide some great ideas toward music selection.

I have listened to the music over and over again as I ride to work. For me, it provides great relaxation as I consider my next moves in dressage!",1263772800,,724,4.738095238095238
7797182,5,157076364X,"A fascinating documentary on how the ultra-complex freestyles are developed, this is demonstrated and narrated by the undoubted reigning champion, her husband, and the two superb musicians.  There are many clips showing the progression, extra clips of live shows, and the Atlanta freestyle.  Also  the extra cd (of musical scores) is worth the price alone.  When combined with the dvd, it is totally awesome.",1259193600,,408,5.328125

7797184,1,157076364X,"I was disappointed by this video. I thought that it would show more freestyle footage. This DVD should have been called: The Making of The Music for Anky.

In the section ""The Shows"", there are two:
James Bond show `Live': It would have not been bad if they did not waste film showing me the orchestra. If I want to watch people play instruments, I would go to the local school and watch them for FREE.
Tango show `live': This starts off with shots of the band. Then the video goes to a split screen with the voice of the tango and various shots of the band. This is ok if you have a monster TV. I do not. There is some good footage but not much. Once again, if I want to watch people play instruments, I would go to the local school and watch them for FREE.

""The Story"", where to start.......... This is mainly about the making of the music. There are only clips of performances. You never get to see a full performance. This is just a documentary about music first and horses second.  I now know more about writing music for freestyle than freestyle itself.  Did I mention that it is in German with subtitles?  That was 29:44 of my life that I will never get back.

""Athene Show Clip"": It as well is music video. Various shots of practice, the composers, eating lunch, the band, Anky singing and yes some from Athens. This section is 6:25 and I am sad to say that this is the best part of the DVD for freestyle footage.

""The Making Of"": This section is actually about making a freestyle routine. I am sorry to say that it is only 14:26 long but it does have some information.

""Gallery"": Just picture but they are very cute.

Overall impression: Not worth spending your money on. I will not make the mistake of buying anymore of Anky's DVD's. God only knows what the next one will be.

The CD of the music was great. I thought that it was the only saving grace to this documentary.",1182902400,5,1885,4.284507042253521
