1542048,3,B00005JO9J,"Grays Anatomy is not a pimple on denny Crane's big fat ass. As a hospital show It it worse than ER. Worse than St. Elsewhere. Worse than Scrubs. I do give it a slight edge on General Hospital, but I am sure this is only because of the respective budgets involved. The Seattle tie in is NOT realistic and badly done. As is typical you can see the Pike market sign out the hospital window and the writers toss in Seattle buzz words inappropriately. Some jerk-off middle management type at ABC has his carrier on the line over the success of Greys and knows it can only make it on the coattails of Desperate Housewives.",1119398400,2,616,4.3652173913043475
1542049,5,B00005JO9J,"When I first heard about Grey's Anatomy I thought this would be another boring medical soap opera angst-fest, but it was so much more. The cast has geniuine chemistry, not just between Shepard and Meredith, but between everyone. The characters are all fantastic, with their little quirks that have us begging for more than what the 1st season offered.

The patients they see also have us wanting more from the characters. Its like ER that the patients any of the patients can die at any time. Its not cheesy in that the ones we love manage to live, because, on several occasions, they have died when its least expected.

By having an outstanding storyline (with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger) and fantastic chemistry, the show manages to stand out among the many medical dramas seen over the years. Even though the 1st season is a bit short, its still worth checking out.",1118016000,23,868,4.78
1542050,5,B00005JO9J,"This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE new show of the season--the chemistry between the actors is outstanding (particularly between Drs Shepherd and Grey) and the music fits perfectly with the show. It has introduced me to so many fabulous new artists. As someone in medical school, I particularly appreciate that it portrays the interns as real people with very real insecurities and tough decisions to make.  I hope ABC is considering releasing a Soundtrack for season 1. This is also the first medical drama that I can remember in which 3 women are the main characters--its about time!! I literally cannnot wait for Season 2...",1117411200,11,621,4.971153846153846
1542051,5,B00005JO9J,"This is the only new show this season, I would say,that is worth watching. I started watching it because of Patrick Dempsey,who has evolved nicely since the mid-80's. Sandra Oh is also proving that she is a very versatile actress. I think she is just terrrific. The sad thing is is the season ended too soon.",1116892800,11,308,4.517857142857143
1542052,5,B00005JO9J,"Ok, I haven't seen the DVD's yet (since they haven't been released) BUT I have not missed an episode. I remember Patrick Dempsey from ""Can't Buy Me Love"" but man, is he HOT now! The chemistry between Dr. Shepherd AKA ""Dr. McDreamy"" (Patrick Dempsey) and Meredith is off the charts. I also like the new romance between Cristina (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington). If you by any chance missed this show rent the DVD's when they become available and Thank me later!

**My husband bought me this for Valentines Day. I AM THRILLED to own this and have been watching it again. The bonus features are AWESOME! You get to see 19 unaired scenes.**

Also, if you are a Katherine Heigl fan (Izzy) checkout ""Love Comes Softly"" and ""Love's Enduring Promise"" - Excellent movies starring her.",1116115200,109,788,4.702898550724638

1542289,1,B00005JO9J,I know people love this show but it's not realistic and there is not one redeemable character in the show. They are all focused on sex and they are immature always letting petty things get in their way.

But if, like my 16 year old daughter, you're in it for all the drama and the cute guys, you should be fine.  I'd give it a 1, she'd give it a 5.  I split the difference and gave it a 3.  :)",1477958400,,355,3.808219178082192

1542463,1,B00005JO9J,twice purchased dvd set and each time it was the wrong region. We lost money because of return postage costs. Through this experience we became aware of the Region issue. There was no clear warning or notice in the posting stating  that this is an important decision to be made. If knowing what Region  (Region-country where the dvd's will play) is needed it should be with more understanding of what it is. We had a very bad experience with these products.

Those that are especially strong (at least in the first year) are Chandra Wilson (she is magnificent), Sandra Oh, and Isaiah Washington (and their chemistry is awesome). Honorable mention--Justin Chambers and Katerine Heigel. For me, the real weak link in character and acting is George/Knight. He seems to be a favorite among many reviewers. Not me. Comic relief? If so, I don't think it worked. The soundtrack is great and seems appropriate.  It's a soap opera, but one of the finest. I already ordered season 2. The 5 star opinion incorporates all aspects of this series.
An excellent start for this series. It really is hard to believe it can get any better than this--season one.",1413590400,,771,4.885496183206107

1543507,5,B00005JO9J,"While I thought it was boring at the time, my mom was rather obsessed with this show for the first three or four years it was on. What was so great and addicting about this medical drama? I decided to check it out for myself, all these years later. Grey's Anatomy is similar to Sex and the City - but with a hospital! It features a main female character, in this case Grey, narrating each episode and telling the audience life lessons about growing up and becoming a working adult. Grey is an intern at Seattle Grace Hospital along with many other interesting personalities, some who soon become her roommates! As interesting medical cases and patients move along during the story, the workers at the hospital all become involved in each other's personal lives and create some drama. But not too much drama. Despite the more recent Grey's seasons being criticized for too much over the top plots, this is a perfect blend of drama and medical life. I would recommend this show to anyone who is able to overlook what this show has supposedly become and the reputation of it being a girly television show.",1394409600,,1102,4.627551020408164

It's also pretty neat to watch on my iPad in the privacy of my bedroom.  The show gets pretty soapy now and then, but it's fun see how they started out.  I watched the first year in two weeks.  A big plus:  no commercials!",1387756800,,384,4.178082191780822

1543749,5,B00005JO9J,I had forgotten how I got hooked on Grey's Anatomy until I watched the first season over again.  Really enjoy watching it without commercial interruptions and realized that I had missed a couple of the episodes (sure that life got in the way).  Already enjoying the second season without interruptions.  For me this is the way to go.  I can watch them when I want and repeat as many times as I want.,1387497600,,399,4.424657534246576

1543792,5,B00005JO9J,I loved how this program went from perfect innocence into the complexities of life. This gives you time to get to know the actors and actresses and how they change as their lives change. It helps that everyone is so gorgious. You want to love or like them so much.,1386979200,,264,4.3

1543852,4,B00005JO9J,Only medical show that captures my attention after the discontinuation of Scrubs.  Started as a comedy and through the usual season after season writers bun out turned a bit too serious.  Looks like it's headed back the right more comediac or humorouse stuff being written in.,1384387200,,276,4.978260869565218

1543860,5,B00005JO9J,"I didn't see the first 3 seasons of Greys Anatomy, so getting it on Amazon Prime is terrific. The series is, as a lot of you know, quite wonderful at mixing exciting medical situations with interesting personal relationships and the cast and production are among the very best.

As for Grey's Anatomy,it's a good show with great characters. The concept is a group of new interns in their first year at a teaching hospital. The story is about their lives and loves,  who knew that young surgeons were that horny? At first it's cute but gets a little soapy.",1380412800,,426,4.2592592592592595

With season one you get to know the main characters and decide which character you will look forward to seeing in future episodes.  I was never a fan of medical shows but Grey's Anatomy has me hooked.  I have not missed a single episode since Season One Episode One.  Watching the show on DVD is so much better because you get to skip the commercials and you get a lot of uncut versions of some of the episodes. What I found interesting was that the price was remarkably low.,1379289600,,570,4.299065420560748

1544068,4,B00005JO9J,"I enjoy the different personalities on Grey's Anatomy. It makes you wonder about your own visits to the E.R. and what the personalities of the Doctors that you see are really like beneath the veneer you see in the examination room.

I don't really feel attached to any of the characters, so it was kind of hard for me to get into.  However, that doesn't mean it's not a good show. I think for the right person it would be a great show.  I'm going to try the second season and see if it holds my attention any better.",1377734400,,417,4.0120481927710845

I was at the Public Library last week. And I see Grey's Anatomy seasons 1-3 on DVD. So I pick them up. And WOW!  I am hooked after watching season one. It is like ER and House put all in one with
a few other things put in with it. Fun, a kick to watch.. And more. And I look at my NetFlix account.. And see they have seasons 1-8 Online and disc..
I will pick up the seasons on DVD as I go.. Glad I checked it out..

I looked on Amazon to see if they had the seasons and THEY DO!!  So I'm trying to catch up and I really LOVE the show.  I don't know why I didn't watch it way in the beginning...I honestly think it is because of all the hype and I didn't want to get caught up in it.  My bad!",1376265600,,435,3.8
1544151,5,B00005JO9J,"Waiting for the new season, this was great. Even with the fear the Grey's Anatomy may be seeing it day with the possible last season, having these past episodes gives us all a chance to enjoy the talent of some great actors and wonderful writing that has kept us tied to Seattle Grace. I was told by my anatomy and physiology instructor, watch as many medical shows as this to gain a better knowledge of the medical world, but I am sure and I hope, without all the sex put in to keep you interested.

None of these mistakes, however, spoil my enjoyment of the show. It has sent me to the internet many times to learn more about obscure medical conditions.

I don't like to be told when to laugh or boo etc. I do like drama with comedy when you least expect it.  I like shows that have a good storyline and hook you into different characters that you follow each week.

The acting is top notch, and you can see as these characters begin getting into their parts. They make you laugh, they make you cry, but during this first season it is mostly laughter.

Give the show a few episodes and I can almost guarantee that it will suck you in after only a few episodes!!",1375660800,,613,4.169491525423729

1544276,5,B00005JO9J,i don't like doctor shows---they make me feel like i am at work. this is more of a story about people and relationships and it just happens in a hospital setting. i have finished season 1 and 2 and working on 3 now and continue to enjoy the show.,1374105600,,246,4.040816326530612
1544277,4,B00005JO9J,"I watched ER several years ago and grew weary of the setup.  Thus, when I started streaming Grey's Anatomy, I was sceptical of enjoying another teaching hospital story.  To my surprise, the characters and plot were unique enough to shock the dead genre back into life--I enjoy this show just as much as I did ER back in its heyday of Dr Ross, Green,  Carter and Benton.",1373760000,,369,4.477611940298507

1544310,2,B00005JO9J,Watch one episode and you have seen them all.  Boring and predictable.  Everyone will sleep with everyone.  Such a waste of life.,1372464000,,129,4.7727272727272725
1544311,4,B00005JO9J,"When people and critics talk about Grey's Anatomy they always make references and comparisons to another great show, ER, but in my opinion these shows couldn't be any more different. Basically seeing these kids turn into adults this show really gives us a chance to get to know these characters by slowing down time and showing these interns, residents, attendings and even the chiefs emotions to each case. Narrated by the self-absorbed, but loveable Meredith Grey you really get insight to how these new additions to Seattle Grace Hospital manage their jobs and their personal lives at the same time. Watching this two disc dvd you will almost certainly love the tough but compassionate Dr. Bailey, women will swoon for the insanely handsome Dr. Shepard, badmouth the talented but crass Dr. Alex Karev, root for George and Izzies friendship, Christina and Burkes relationship, and of course Meredith and Dereks central one as well. While not always having original storylines, this is a great start to a new show.",1371254400,,1015,5.0476190476190474

1544313,3,B00005JO9J,"Compared to everything else there is to watch on TV now, it was above average. Good story, good acting. I am old fashioned although I don't think good morals get old, but I think there is too much emphasis on low moral behavior on the show.",1371081600,,240,4.239130434782608

1544316,5,B00005JO9J,"I avoid the ""popular"" so I didn't watch Grey's Anatomy Season 1 when it first aired.  Too, I'm terrible at remembering what shows are on what nights.  I love that I can binge watch a series.  But the last show of the series made me not want to watch season 2 because Izzie's character went out of character for the sake of a dramatic storyline.",1370908800,,344,4.2615384615384615

1544392,5,B00005JO9J,"This series is just so real.  I don't agree with the life styles portrayed by the characters because promiscuous sex never leads to lasting happiness.  That being said, the emotions portrayed, the fully fleshed characters, and a twisting, turning plot keep me watching.......laughing, crying with the characters.  This program is just so well done!",1369526400,,348,5.407407407407407

1544446,5,B00005JO9J,Lets be honest the first few seasons of Grey's Anatomy are the best. When the love affair started and they were struggling interns. Now it is too serious with all those plane crashes. If you want entertainment then watch the first few seasons and stop at that!,1369008000,,260,4.553191489361702
1544447,5,B00005JO9J,Grey's Anatomy - Season I will always be a favorite.  This series is where it all came together and got started.  There are a lot of intense and emotional scenes as there are the comedy and care free moments.  Grey's Anatomy gives you a real life feeling of how a large hospital is run and the life and death decisions that occur in a heartbeat...  Each intern reveals their own individual strengths and weaknesses in a crazier than life friendships and controversy that keeps them meshed together.,1368921600,,498,4.689655172413793

1544485,5,B00005JO9J,"Season 1 is the first glimpse of the unique characters that populate Seattle Grace Hospital. The staff's personal stories are a continous revelation.

1544818,5,B00005JO9J,Never watched until I ordered the series....like to watch from the 1st episode.  Really enjoying this series. Hope to finish the whole thing in a few months and be up to par with my DVR....,1351036800,,189,4.4
1544819,5,B00005JO9J,"This review is more for the whole series and not just for this one season. I just finished watching the latest episode, which is now on season 9. The entire time I watched this episode with my wife I was drying tears from her face, along with having us both laughing five minutes later and then having her crying again a couple minutes after that. This series has been like that since the beginning, well the first season was really great but I don't think I remember it being really sad, more introducing the characters and making you fall in love with them.
  Through this series you will lose characters and have new ones come in, which first I was against. I got invested in these characters and started caring enough about these characters and their distinct personalities that I had made up my mind that when new characters came in that I would never care for them the way I care about the originals. Don't get me wrong there are quite a few original characters that are still in the series at season 9, but I have grown to love each and every character that the show brings in. If you are reading this debating on whether this is a series worth getting into, I would definitely recommend it to anyone that would enjoy an intense hospital character driven drama and I know that my wife would definitely agree with me seeing that I can't get her attention when the show is on.",1348963200,,1381,4.433070866141732

1544822,1,B00005JO9J,"Wow! I didn't know they hire teenagers to write TV shows with adult characters, but I guess there's a place for puerile drama for adults. Not so sure what the excuse is for the atrocious acting by so many actors (especially patients and their families - holy cow! Surely they must be relatives of cast members, writers, or production personnel, only excuse I can think of), but I guess budget trumps all in this one. Still, I admit, I find this series entertaining to watch in the same way I'm drawn to watch ""fail"" videos on YouTube - like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over. I sure do have respect for the lead actors who managed to keep straight faces while reading scripts and reading their lines, and can't blame them for going for the steady paycheck.",1346889600,2,774,4.49645390070922

Also romance is in it so its 3 for 1 deal. I like it and I will continue to watch til I get the the season and episode aired now. which is like season 6-7 ... Not sure? But for anyone looking for a great series but not sure if this is right for you. I asure you to just watch the first 3 episodes and decide from there... i like it and im enjoying it so far.

1544987,5,B00005JO9J,"I now have a Roku box and a subscription to Netflix.  This means I have a wide variety of movies and series of TV shows at my fingertips.  What a joy!  Last weekend I watched the entire 9 episodes of the 2005 first season of Grey's Anatomy in one sitting.  It was a real joy, especially since each episode is only 40 minutes long and does not have commercials. I've always liked medical dramas and used to be hooked on ER.  But that now seems dated.  I was totally enraptured by this new addiction of mine to Grey's Anatomy and can see me watching every season whenever I can find the time.

The scene is now set. A group of new interns are introduced to the Seattle hospital. Ellen Pompeo is cast in the title role.  Her mother was a surgeon there but there is a mystery around why she left.  T.R. Knight is cast as a bumbling intern with a crush on Pompeo but her heart belongs to a staff doctor, Derek Sheppard.  And then there is Katherine Hengel. a former top model and Sandra Oh, somewhat caustic in her competitiveness.  By the end of the nine episodes all these people became real to me.

And then there are the medical dramas - the cheerleader who collapsed during competition, the newborn baby with something wrong with his heart, the surgeon who was in danger of losing his eyesight, the complicated operations which forced the doctors to stand on their feet for hours at a time and think quickly and accurately, and the disappointments, both with the patients and with their romances.  I loved it all and can't wait to watch Season 2 which I understand has many more episodes and will be impossible to watch in one day.",1297987200,,1631,4.414715719063545

Season 1 to me was kind of slow, basically I beleive because the writer wanted to give us the knowledge neccessary to understand some medical terminology. Season 1 for that reason was slow, but do not let that define your interest in GA, once you get to Season 2 you will not be dissapointed, and you will better understand the stories and the surprisess. So I gave this season 5 stars because like I explain is like a Medical book, yet for a great series it was the ground where everything was build.

1545042,4,B00005JO9J,"It's been years since I've seen these episodes, and I have to say that I didn't like them as much as I did when they aired. I can't really pinpoint what now I don't like, but I just didn't enjoy them as much. Even though I had forgotten most of the patients I still didn't feel like I cared if they lived or died. Another problem with this season is that it is only nine episodes. Grey's was a mid season replacement in 2005 and only nine were made. Nine hours doesn't give the show a lot of time to expand it's plot lines. There are some nice plots that are introduced though, but you won't see them blossom until season 2. The actors are all excellent. They really show the pain and frustration of doctors very well. Like I said before I loved these episodes when they aired so maybe my enjoyment of the episodes is ruined because I know how these doctors are going to end up in later seasons. Maybe some of the suspense is taken away. One thing that this show is good at is showing how death is just as potent as life. There is a lot of death in this show. Sometimes a depressing amount, but it is rather riveting if you don't know what's coming. The special features are messed up on this release. All of them are on the second disc. Even the deleted scenes from episodes on the first disc are on disc two. This led me to just ignore them all together. Overall this is a nice introduction to a great series. I recommend renting this season, because as I said they were not as enjoyable the second time around. Also there are only nine episodes and [...] bucks seems a little high, even though I paid forty when they came out in 2005. I hope that the re watch of season 2 is a little more enjoyable. I will be reviewing that as well later. If you like medical dramas with some soap opera relationships, then Grey's Anatomy should be playing in your DVD player in the near future.",1270944000,,1882,4.230555555555555

At least ""Days of Our Lives"" didn't pretend to be something it wasn't.  I was so glad when Ally McBeal finally went off the air, but now there's this.

1545113,4,B00005JO9J,"The first season of Grey's Anatomy shows you how the show began.  It focuses on Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her relationship with Derek Shepard (Patrick Dempsey), who turns out to be the head of neuro, and the other interns during their first year of interning at Seattle Grace Hospital.  The other major characters include Meredith's best friend Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Meredith's friend and roommate Isobele ""Izzie"" Stephens (Katherine Heigl), Meredith's friend and roommate George O'Malley (TR Knight), Meredith's (eventual) friend Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Meredith's resident (supervisor) Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), head of cardio surgeon and (eventually) Cristina's boyfriend Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), and Chief of Surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.).

I agree with one of the other reviewers that this and season 2 are the best seasons.  The other seasons are fun to watch too, but they're a bit more dramatic than the first two seasons.  Honestly, if you stopped watching at the end of season 3, you haven't missed much.",1258070400,,1062,5.412121212121212

1545166,5,B00005JO9J,"This is an immediately addictive TV show. I didn't know about it until after the first season had aired, so I watched it on my portable DVD player in my bed. Personally, I prefer this because this way, you don't have to wait a whole week to find out what happens next, except of course for the last episode. The situation is interesting: Meredeth is handed the (seemingly) perfect guy, but doesn't want him. Add the other interns (George, Alex, Izzy, Christina) and doctors (Shepard, Burke, Bailey, Weber) and intricate workings of the hospital and you get a great mix. Sometimes is makes you mad, but the characters are realistic and well-balanced. This season only has 9 episodes so you can decide if you like the show or not.

Having done so, I say this is a GREAT SHOW - grabs you from the first episode.  As with all good TV shows and videos the characters and their interpersonal relationships rather than the plot drive the show.  In this show, there are many recurring characters.  All have strengths and weaknesses and they are compelling both individually and as they relate to each other with respect their personal lives and with the pressures of working in a life and death environment.  None is a total stereotype.  Each at some point surprises the viewer with a personality characteristic or personal history that is unexpected and untelegraphed.  Each finds the value of maintaing friendships and/or relationships despite the recognized flaw(s) of the others.

The discs default to English subtitles, presumably for the hearing impaired.  This is an distracting set up that is also present on the Season 2 disc.",1245110400,,1046,4.959770114942529

Who  thought the cold and calculating Christina would become close friends with the whiny Grey and then hook up with Burk?

The characters were fresh and real, the recurring storylines were well-written and real, and most of all, the acting was the best I have ever seen on television. Creator Shonda Rimes has created a medical soap opera that tops all tv shows on the air. The recurring dramatic plots include: George's secret feelings for Meredith, Burke and Shepherd's struggle for power in the OR, Chief Webber's brain cancer, Derek's pursue and controversial romance with Meredith, and Meredith's struggle to keep her mothers disease under wraps.

Thank god...something better than all of the boring rehashed dribble they are putting on TV lately.  It was about time we had something original to watch- original storylines as well as unique characters.  Grey's is entertaining, intelligent, sexy, fun, thought-provoking and shocking.

I think what draws so many people to Grey's is that it has a good MIX- a dramatic show with medical emergencies, but it also is about the love lives and professional careers of the staff.  They have a fine balance between the two where neither take over, and the same for the characters, they each get their own storylines.  The staff is so enjoyable because the characters are so diverse, it's not just a show full of only dating or all married people.

Season 1 was a fine season to start Grey's Anatomy.  It's not my favorite season, but it was full of interesting stories both on the medical side and on the characters development and lives.  If you haven't watched Grey's, you're really missing out!",1215561600,,1079,4.758064516129032

1545278,5,B00005JO9J,"Obviously, you'd have to be a Grey's Anatomy fan to get into this package, because it chronicles the whole first season.  I wasn't into the show heavily at that point; my ex got me into it as it progressed that year, but I do remember a few of these episodes from first-run, and I like having this collection around, on the days that are not Thursday and I want to see a classic episode of this show.  One thing: I haven't seen Addison yet, as I don't think she appeared until season 2.  No Callie either; she didn't appear until Season 3.  This may not be for fans of Season 4 (current season), which is WAY different in tone than these DVDs.  At this time, a few years ago, I thought this was the best show on TV ever.  Due to some of the cast reshuffling, I no longer feel that way, as I do feel the quality has declined quite a bit (seasons 1-3 were the best, and I'd rate season 4 as 6/10, with some episodes rated as less than that).  The ""emotional"" factor is still there, occasionally, and it is probably heavier than it was in season 1, where they were just defining who the characters were, but I'd definitely say give seasons 1-3 a spin before getting into the post-Burke era, which doesn't seem to be their strongest.  Last point: in watching these episodes, it is clear to me that Burke (Isaiah Washington) is sorelly missed, as he was pretty much the ""star"" of the show at this time.  Case in point is the season 4 ""let go of the dress"" episode, which was just rerun.  That is one of the all time worst episodes in Grey's history.  Also, you may want to keep in mind, as you watch these episodes from season 1, that the show was part of the Sunday ABC lineup at the time, bookended by ""Desperate Housewives.""  I personally thought this was the best pairing in the show's history, and you can't tell me the pairing with Grey's and ""Big Shots"" is better, because ""Big Shots"" needs to be cancelled asap.",1200614400,,1914,4.3008356545961

Grey's Anatomy is not a 'chick' show (my extremely anti-chick flick boyfriend also loves this series).  It is not a soap opera.  It is not a 'medical show' - while there is some technical stuff in it, you don't need an MD to understand what's going on.

Grey's Anatomy is a show about people in the competitive medical field.  Their loves, fears, friendships.  The dialogue is clever, the comebacks are witty, and the characters are extremely lovable.

1545379,4,B00005JO9J,"I'll be honest.

I wanted to hate Grey's Anatomy.

After all, it was just another hospital drama. ER was good for maybe three seasons, then continued to spiral. Who really knows where House is going at this point. Yet another guilty pleasure for an American public obsessed with medical drama.

I really wanted to hate it.

But, somehow, I got sucked in. My roommate watched it. The girls down the hall watched it. The guys downstairs. My neighbors. My mother, for crying out loud. So the last episode of season 2, I found myself glued to a television screen, dying to know what happened next.

I can't really explain how that happened. It could have been the combination of reasonably intelligent dialogue and good casting. It could have been the lively pace backed with an only occasionally melodramatic soundtrack. Perhaps it was the illustrious Dr. McDreamy.

It must have been a little of all of those things, because here we are, about a month from the premiere of season 4 and I can't wait.

Grey's manages to do what most other dramas (medical and otherwise) can't; it stays contemporary without having a shelf-life of an hour. It stays meaningful without getting overly preachy. It shows the medical world with a solid dose of realism - the long hours, the grisly cases, the patients no one can save, no matter how they try - and shows its characters outside of the hospital, having lives and problems of their own.

So like I said, I wanted to hate Grey's.

There is all present at once: blood, despair, hopefulness, narrow escapes from the deathbed, and sometimes death leaving their imprints on 5 both hopeful and insecure interns who starve to prove themselves in an unforgiving OR.

sexy ... for the usual attraction pulling some of the characters into weird intermingled relations spanning from friendship to sexy encounters with one another.

lifty ... since the elevator traps people temporarily inside and serves a repeating trigger for twists and turns in the story

dreamy ... for a somewhat lunatic - and at the same time wonderfully disturbed main female character dreaming about the knight in the white coat, alias Dr. McDreamy..

twisty ... with many unexpected twists and turns throughout the season (some of which will not be revealed till season 2)

edgy ... for 5 well drafted opposing characters which end up as friends at last .. but do they really? A great and very self-absorbed character played by the Emmy winner Christina Oh is destined to kill for the chance of scrubbing in at the OR...

Each episode is very well plotted and the medical problems and procedures are believable and involving. Although the sex lives of the staff seem a litle too casual and open, that may be just a reflection of my own advanced age and outdated attitudes.",1178928000,2,494,4.488888888888889

If you are interested in seeing it from its start (for the first time, or all over again), this is truly the way to go.  I don't want to elaborate on tantalizing plot twists or character quirks, here.  That is something you should take the time to see for yourself, and I don't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience!  I will say that the life and times of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Dr. Derek Shephard--AKA Dr. McDreamy (Patrick Dempsey), Intern Christina Yang (Sandra Oh), and the lot of them are funny, at times quite fantastical, and thought-provoking.

Grey's Anatomy looked like just another medical drama to me until I watched it on the advice of my mother, who is like me, an avid ER fan. I am now addicted. The characters on this show are interesting, and flawed in a different way than the usual (i.e. Merideth Grey's promiscuity to which she fully admits, or Christina's incredible competitiveness even when it doesn't matter).

But these shows are the beginning of a phenomenon.  The characters in this show are incredibly intriguing yet flawed.  It's very interesting to follow them through their mistakes and triumphs. The on-screen chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey is amazing.  Sandra Oh and Isaiah Washington are fantastic together.  There is not a character on this show that I don't love in one way or another.  I watched season 1 after viewing all of season 2.  It was odd to go back but very nice to see how these characters and this incredible show all started!

The cast of this program is fabulous, each and everyone having their own ax to grind and their own personalities and challenges.  Each is unique.  You mix all this with the story lines of each patient and their process from admission to either checking out and going home or dying and it's interesting and sometimes captivating.

It's familiar and yet so much has happened since then, that you can't help but smile when you think back on it. I fully enjoyed reliving every moment of the show's beginnings.

 I'd say that if you're a die hard fan, you should own this, if you don't already. Trust me, you'll laugh at the same places. The jokes are still funny a second and third time around.

 If you're not a die hard fan, but you've heard a lot of buzz about the show and you'd like to get into it, you should get this. There are so many subtle events that have shaped the present situations, that it'll be hard to fully understand the show where it is. You can watch it now and still find enjoyment, but you'll be in the dark for a little while.

What I really enjoyed is how the creative team made sure to build in the character developments to the various story lines.  So many shows have spent the first episode or four just introducing the various characters that there's essentially no story and end up with a boring or unwatched show.  The writers of Grey's Anatomy created a show with characters and stories that are relatable to.",1168300800,,527,4.706521739130435

Grey's Anatomy is very glamorous compared to any hospital but it lets you escape from the real world, even if it's only for a short while.

This television series is one of the best dramas I've ever seen in a while. The cast has great chemistry, especially Patrick Dempsy and Ellen Pompeo. The script is flawless, full of new obstacles for each character to go through per episode, with bits of comedic writing in it as well. I have compared this series with the ER series and personally, I like this series much better. Grey's Anatomy has bits of life lessons for viewers to learn every so often. Many episodes breaks your hearts, making you feel tempted to even yell or shout at the television screen! Great cliff-hangers, making viewers waiting impatiently until next Thursday to see what happens next! Overall, Grey's Anatomy is a wonderful show. Tune in!

The only negative thing I have to say regarding Season One of Grey's Anatomy is that it was too short - in comparison to Season Two.",1168128000,,1190,4.5514018691588785

A former model turned surgeon who must prove her worth, a star intern who falls for the brain surgeon (who used to ride a motorcycle and listens to The Clash), the aggressively ambitious Asian American woman, the frat boy with a sensitive soul (who falls for the ex-model), sleeping with your boss and getting pregnant, etc.  You name it, Grey's Anatomy's got it.  Sometimes, it feels like an insult to your intelligence, especially when Meredith's does voiceovers: ""Adulthood means responsibility... and responsibility sucks.""

The pressures of being medical ""newbies"" added to the dilemmas created by new friendships and new loves brings out the best and worst in these people.  The writing is excellent, the acting believable.  Some of the medical scenarios are a little far-fetched, but it's TELEVISION!  Bottom line: very entertaining.

1545993,1,B00005JO9J,"I still can't believe this show gets acclaim for being ""smart"" and ""original.""

Smart?  There are so many things factually wrong with this show it's ridiculous.  Any hospital that lets INTERNS perform surgery right off the bat is not one I would want to go to.  It would never happen.  Would you get on a plane with a pilot that had studied flying, but never actually flown a plane?  No way.  Also, is it believable that an intern could diagnose someone that doctors with 15+ years of experience couldn't?  I don't think so.

Original?  No.  Have any of you seen Scrubs?  Probably not.  If you did, you'd think this show was a remake.  Grey's Anatomy is narrated by the main character. Scrubs is narrated by the main character.  Watch the first few episodes of Grey's and on occasions you will hear Cynthia call George ""Bambi"", the same name Carla calls J.D. in Scrubs. Notice George;the goofy, messy brown haired, loveable doctor. Notice J.D.; the goofy, messy brown haired, loveable doctor. Notice Bailey; the coarse, scathing mean doctor, that's mean to teach the interns a lesson but really likes them and feels for them. Notice Cox; the coarse, scathing mean doctor, thats mean to teach the interns a lesson but really likes them and feels for them.  Grey's even steals music from Scrubs.

It's painful to watch a Scrubs meets Melrose Place, far-fetched, ridiculous show like this gain the praise and ratings it so doesn't deserve.  I only wonder how long it will take the masses to realize how worthless this show is.",1158969600,23,1523,4.748091603053435

Fortunately, the network started running the series over on Thursday nights so I was able to watch it all from the beginning.  It's the best writing on TV today.  So I bought the DVD to watch while on the treadmill.  Imagine my disappointment when I started watching the DVD and since I had just started the series on Thursday nights, I could spot right away that some of the episodes are abridged.  I don't know why they did this.  I would have been very confused, I think, had  I not seen the original Episode 2 The First Cut is the Deepest, and not understood how Meredith ended up at the nursery watching the babies and how she ended up carrying the severed ""appendage"" around all day and night.  George's part was almost entirely cut out.  They should have left the episodes intact.",1156809600,27,879,4.44375

Grey's Anatomy has it's share of ""it just doesn't work that way"" moments re: the medicine, but its characters and storyline are so entertaining that you get drawn in immediately.

A friend gave me the DVD of Season One and told me I'd like it.  I had it several weeks before popping it in to the DVD player late one night when I just needed to veg out.  About 3:00am I made myself turn off the DVD after watching the first five epidsodes in a row!  Of course, I finished it the next night.  Since then, I've been hooked and recording all the summer re-runs of Season Two I can find.  (Can't wait for that DVD to be released!)

I think the thing that sucks you in is the characters.  The interaction between the five very-different interns, the ""nazi"" resident (who is a big softy underneath), and the attending surgeons plays well.  The story line is always entertaining and doesn't tend to follow predictable ""hospital show"" lines.  Overall, very enjoyable!",1156636800,5,1172,4.586538461538462

1546021,5,B00005JO9J,"I absolutely love Grey's Anatomy. I tell people all the time that what is so refreshing about this ""medical"" drama is that characters are ""very"" real people, most of which can be found in our families or lives. The writer of the show has found the perfect ingredients for success....a wonderful cast of characters (none of them are toooooo perfect..LOL. Just flawed enough to make them believable), a wonderful storyline and seemingly endless amounts of new material. It is better than ER in its prime.

The story seems to center around Meredith Grey, an intense, lonely, resident who is broken emotionally by a series of events outside of her control (I think her parents divorce, her mother's illness, and a sex life that consists of meeting strangers in bars and taking them home). But while the story is about her, it is her interaction with a host of other characters that really makes the show good. The show opens with Meredith rushing to work after spending the night with a guy she met in a bar. Guess what, when she arrives to work, she finds that her new boss is none other than Dr. Shepherd, otherwise known as ""McDreamy"". Over the course of the show, we find that Dr. Shepherd is living and dealing with demons of his own. There are also her roommates, George (who is hopelessly in love with Meredith) and Izzy (the pretty girl who paid her way through medical school by modeling). There are friends Christina (a perfectionist), and an egotistical resident who would rather be nasty than nice. There are other people at the hospital, the Chief, Burke (a perfectionist with a heart), and Bailey (who everyone calls the Nazi). Grey's Anatomy is only getting better and I can not wait until the next season is available.",1155513600,4,1730,4.728476821192053

The show spends far too much time on the personal lives of the characters...I mean it might just be a misunderstanding, but I was lead to believe that these characters were doctors...am I wrong? They are the most unpassable doctor characters I have ever come across in a TV series. If I wanted humour and drama in a medical series, I would watch House, because at least the cases are interesting and the people intricate puzzles. If I wanted just the humour, I would watch Scrubs.

In essence, if they were curing the bubonic plague on this show, then people might find it worth watching...otherwise, avoid like the plague.",1154649600,9,843,4.576158940397351

1546078,5,B00005JO9J,"I started from the very first episode and many people I knew only joined in the second season. The fact is the relation between Meredith and Dr. Shepherd began weakly and could not, on its own, keep the story going. Neither could Meredith's own struggle for her parents. Her life is just too sad and lonely. On the other hand, the character development of Cristina and Dr. Burke flourished and developed into a strong bond. They were unmatched in many ways, their clash of personalities for one, and yet they made an interesting couple. His patience and her insecurity were fun to watch. The forthcoming Izzie, the unsettled Dr. Karev and the easy-to-relate-to Dr. O'Malley display strengths of character.

The entry of Dr. Addison Shepherd tilted the balance and lifted  Ellen's heavy responsibility of carrying the story alone off her shoulders. Immediately, Meredith has more promising prospects and steers her life in the right direction. Instead of people revolving around the life of Meredith and her Dreamy, it is much more gratifying to view all these characters growing and supporting each other all the way.

I am amazed how they blast you with something shocking and then let you breathe with laughter the next minute.  The show has the best writers out there as they weave their magic spell.  It is almost too much to handle in an hour.

Also Burke, McDreamy and Alex are equally easy on the eyes (and great actors).  And Izzie just makes the show fun to watch.  At first I thought she was just a barbie, but then she proved that she's an amazing actress with both comedy and drama.  Christina is great with her dry, hard shell.  It really is an all-star cast.

I'm not a big fan of Medical Dramas really; I never watched ER or Scrubs or anything like that. But I loved Grey's Anatomy.

The mix of drama and comedy and realism was done excellently.

I myself am a medical intern, and i assure you much of what you see is realistic about the medical world. They may not get the medecine right 100% of the time, but they do get it right! In fact they do it so well that i find myself giving my own superiors quotes and clinical facts from the show.

They also give a pretty true portrayal of an interns life.. it is that hectic and that non-stop and the doctors are really that gruelling if not more so.

Yet we still find time (if even it means making more than 24hrs in a day) to get caught up in all the drama of surrounding life.

If there's any show to put on your must see list its this!!",1149984000,,904,4.107954545454546
1546133,3,B00005JO9J,"I began this short first season of Grey's Anatomy with confusion.  Was it a comedy program, was it a drama, was it the clich dramedy, or was it simply another television program attempting to bite what little piece of the ER pie there was still remaining?  It feels as if a network cannot be successful unless they staple their nightly lineup with either a lawyer-based program, or a medical drama.  With Grey's Anatomy on ABC, Scrubs on NBC, and ER still on NBC, one could probably get their own medical degree by simply watching prime time television.  Either way, Grey's Anatomy is your clich addictive dramedy that is not quite as original as Scrubs and not to the emotional level that ER attempts to consistently be at.  It is, simply put, bland, but addictive.

Grey's Anatomy reminds me of a bag of Cheetos.  As you open the bag, a gust of overwhelming smells enters your body.  You assume that what you are about to eat is going to be the greatest taste sensation to enter your mouth.  This could be equated to the opening scenes of Grey's Anatomy, but as you begin to chow down on those cheesy corporate made morsels, you discover that they taste just like everything else that you have ever eaten, and leave nothing more than bad breath and a orange powder on your fingers.  Yet, here is where Grey's Anatomy finally gets you.  Grey's Anatomy is the orange powder on your fingers that you cannot help but continually lick off, instead of just rinsing clean.  While the characters are clich and seen in every television program created (the trailer park girl who worked her way to the top, the insecure boy, the jock, the over-achiever, and the ""regular"" middle-ground character), the story surrounding Grey's Anatomy will make you want to watch another episode after another episode, devouring every drop of orange powder, instead of simply washing it off.

Grey's Anatomy is a painful show.  There are characters that you will love (the ""Nazi"" seems more real than anyone else on the show), the jokes will make you smile occasionally, and the intensity of being a first year doctor is obviously in place, but where Grey's Anatomy fails is the originality.  This is not original programming.  Using the season finale cliffhanger as an example, we, as a society of television watchers, have seen this all before.  The ""shock"" of the final episode did nothing for me.  I was not flabbergasted or excited about the upcoming season, I just felt cheated.  Why can't programs like this be more original?  You have recycled elements (newbies at a prestigious hospital) coupled with clich moments (the head newbie has a relationship with the head doctor).  Even if you haven't seen this series yet, you already know what is going to happen.

I think what utterly disappointed me about this program was the lack of ""realism"".  Sure, perhaps the lingo within the hospital walls were correct, and perhaps even the way that the interns were treated was accurate, but I do not feel that the characters (George, Izzy, Cristina, Alex, and Meredith) seemed plausible in any way.  I hate television programs claiming to be realistic dramedies that take the Friends route to acutely describe the social lives of the characters.  What I mean by this is that bills, transportation, outside circumstances that would typically be labeled as ""real life"", seem to go by the wayside and simply handed to them.  Take for example the party that Izzy threw at Meredith's house, how unbelievable was that?  At least 50 people and no cops were called or was there any concern of how much money these medical interns had to pay for all the booze.  Again, this was just one of many instances of this occurrence, but I hate when television programs take these shortcuts.  I want realism, I want real characters, and is it too much to ask that I want ""real"" issues.  Grey's Anatomy did not provide with enough laughs or enough original drama for me to enjoy it further than just your typical television series.

Overall, I thought Grey's Anatomy played it safe.  The characters will not instantly attract you, but by the end of the first season there is a small spark in their eyes.  I will denounce the originality of this show because ... well ... there wasn't any.  The actors surrounding the characters were amateur at best, not quite grasping a character as a whole, but instead playing whatever had to be done for the immediate episode.  I know, from the votes listed here, that I will be in the minority, but I didn't think Grey's Anatomy needed to be as publicized as it was.  Was it good?  I would classify this series (at least the first season) as just ""general"" viewing.  If you were waiting for something to do for about an hour, I would put this program on, but to be a fan ... I think that would be difficult.  I look forward to the next season to see if the creators keep with their theme of unoriginality, or if they decide to actually push the envelope for a bit.  For this viewer, I hope they can muster enough strength to do the latter ...

1546134,5,B00005JO9J,"Grey's Anatomy is a lighthearted funny medical comedy-drama that gives more insight into the doctors' lives than similar shows like House or ER.  The main characters of the show are the five surgical interns assigned to Dr. Bailey, a resident at Seattle Grace Hospital.  These aren't just any interns, they're surgical interns, the most cutthroat group of them all.  Under the tutelage of Dr. Derek Shepherd, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Preston Burke, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and ""The Chief""  Richard Webber, the interns learn and grow.  The show focuses not only on their cases and individual lives, but on the interaction the interns have with each other, their coworkers, and their patients.

The interns are:

Meredith Grey--daughter of living legend and super-surgeon, Ellis Grey. Dartmouth Graduate, though doesn't make it plain that she knows more than everyone else--at least not all the time.  Owns the house that three of the interns decide to share.  An overall nice girl.  It's a shame for poor Meredith that on her first day as a surgical intern she discovers she's slept with one of her bosses, Dr. Derek Shepherd (otherwise known as Dr. McDreamy).

Christina Yang--Brown undergraduate, Stanford Medical School, and overall overachiever.  Christina Yang is smarter than you, and she's going to make it plain.  Christina is the type of girl who if you were racing to the corner and you tripped and fell, she'd finish the race first then come back and see if you were okay.  It works for her though and it's hard to dislike her for it.

Alex Karev--someone has to play the bad guy, and on this show it's Karev.  He's the doctor who will tell you that you've got cancer and then tell you to suck it up when you shed a tear.  The good thing about Karev though is that his brutal honesty isn't covering up for anything.  Occasionally you find yourself wondering if someone can really be so callous.  Yes, they can.

Izzy Stevens--Izzy is the pretty girl who people will always look at twice upon finding out that she's really a doctor.  She paid her way through medical school by posing as a centerfold in a men's magazine and the male doctors don't want to let her be more than a pretty face.  Izzy is the doctor you'd want to have if you were looking for compassion, and a kind word rather than the cold hard truth of the matter.

George O'Malley--rounds out the merry group by being the peacemaker and the one who keeps everything balanced.  It's blatantly obvious that he has a huge crush on Meredith, but he thinks no one has a clue.  For some reason, Dr. Burke has picked George as his favorite.

This group of interns offer humor, warmth, and usually some interesting turn every week.  This show is the reason I watch television on Sunday, and for a little hidden insight check out greyswriters.com, where you can see what the writers were thinking when they came up with different story lines. This show is definitely worth taking a look at, even though the first season only has 2 discs with 9 episodes total.",1149120000,4,3021,4.726577437858508
1546135,5,B00005JO9J,"Just when you thought TV execs had scraped the bottom of the medical show barrel, along comes GREY'S ANATOMY, a surprisingly fresh dramedy about the personal and professional lives of five surgical interns and their superiors.  In particular, the show focuses on Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of a legendary surgeon who - unbeknownst to everyone but Meredith - has advanced Alzheimer's disease.  In the first episode, Meredith awakens next to her one-night-stand, then rushes off for her first day at work.  When she arrives there, she discovers that her one-night-stand is in fact her boss, Dr. Derek Sheperd (Patrick Dempsey)!

Meredith's not the only one with problems - her friends and fellow have their share of difficulties as well.  These friends include the wisecracking Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), ex-model Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), kind and shy George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), and the arrogant Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).  In charge of the interns is the cantankerous Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), also known as ""The Nazi"".  They must also contend with the stern Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington), who hides a kind heart beneath his harsh shell.

There are two ""hot"" medical shows currently airing on TV, each resting on one side of the medical show spectrum.  At the dark, pessimistic end of the spectrum is HOUSE, M.D.  At the light end of the spectrum is GREY'S ANATOMY.  GREY'S ANATOMY utilizes a staff of talented writers who consistently come up with intelligent, creative scripts and inventive scenarios for the characters.  The show is never dull and always interesting, thanks in no small part to the writing staff.  The dialogue is witty and well-written.  The series masterfully fluctuates between being cheerfully humorous and grimly dramatic.  None of this would be possible without the great writing staff.  However, I must bring up the point that Meredith's voice-overs are so simplistic that they're cringeworthy.

Even if the writing wasn't top-notch, the cast would be able to keep the show afloat.  Ellen Pompeo is very good as Meredith, but her performance is dominated by those from the rest of the cast.  Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight are particularly great, and the two work very well together.  Sandra Oh is very amusing, and she has some great chemistry with Isaiah Washington - who is, by the way, excellent.  Then there's Patrick Dempsey, whose Derek Shepherd is as suave and cool a doctor as ever there was.

It seems that most shows today have great soundtracks.  GREY'S ANATOMY is no exception - in fact, it has one of the best soundtracks of any show airing today.  The songs add new depth to each scene, always enhancing the show rather than detracting from it.  The theme song, Psapp's ""Cosy in the Rocket"", works wonderfully in the credits sequence.  I must say that the credits sequence is one of the best I've ever seen.  I don't know what it is about it - it just seems perfect to me.  There are no pictures of the cast, merely credits and images which let the audience know that this is more than a medical show: it follows the personal lives of the characters as well.

How odd that so many great shows have begun as mid-season replacements.  GREY'S ANATOMY is one such show.  What began as a mid-season replacement has now become one of the biggest shows on television - and rightly so.  Great writing, inventive yet realistic scenarios, an excellent cast and a terrific soundtrack: what more could you want?  There's only one flaw in the series' first season: it's a mere 9 episodes long.

GREY'S ANATOMY is like a breath of fresh air.  And by the end of this season, you WILL be gasping for more.",1148774400,8,3665,4.884927066450567
1546136,1,B00005JO9J,"If you expected the main character to be a strong independent woman just because she's a doctor, think again. She's like Bridget Jones times three. She's intimidated by everything, reactionary rather than proactive, and seems to generally have the social and emotional maturity of a twelve year old. I don't think there's been such a child-woman as a lead character in a tv show since Cybill Shephard in Moonlighting. The father/daughter dynamic of the relationship between Dr Shephard and Grey shows a disturbingly archaic attitude towards gender politics.

The plots and supporting characters could potentially make up for the appeal the lead character is lacking, but they don't. They're not actively bad, just bland and inconsequential.",1148601600,14,740,5.379310344827586

I can't wait until season 2 is released, I will be one of the firsts ones to buy it.

1546142,5,B00005JO9J,"Wow!  I discovered this show by accident.  THANK GOODNESS!  What a brilliant, well-written, well-acted drama!  The multiple plot lines, seeing the human, often flawed sides of doctors, even the music is just...the show is amazing.  ABC has a winner and this DVD  set is a must-see DVD of this year.

Sadly, season 1 only ran nine episodes due to ABC discovering it late into the year.  Even still, nine episodes of GREAT TELEVISON are better than none.

One thing that really stood out was seeing the character flaws.  Watching Meredith as she pursued a married man.  Hearing her call herself a whore while she's in bed with another man.  Seeing her hide from her Dad when he shows up at the hospital after so many years of being out of her life.  My heart cringed when Derrick (played superbly by Patrick Dempsey) told her he was ""very sorry"" right before his wife showed up.  By giving her flaws and making her appear like a regular person, she wins over hearts of viewers -- at least me.  I was rooting for her throughout season one and now season two.

The other characters are just as good, if not better.  Burke, one of the residents, plays the confident, assured of himself, resident who, when he discovers he has competition for chief resident, doesn't consider the competition the enemy...just competition.  This, despite the current chief promising the slot to Burke.  Watching him work in the OR, he isn't cocky...just damned good.

And who would have thought little Katherine Heigl (Izzie)would turn out to be so...well...full-figured?  She plays as a former model (actually looks like one too!) who paid her way through medical school by posing in lingerie -- cue a plot twist!  She is beautiful, funny, and has ""quarks"" that make her adorable.

Sandra Oh plays as Cristina, a well-educated (3 or 4 degrees), motorcycle-riding, Korean doc.  She provides a tough, no-nonsense balance to Izzie.  T.R. Knight, who plays O'Malley, is funny to watch.

Last but not least, there is Chandra Wilson, who plays as Miranda Bailey.  Her behavior, mannerisms, and the way she keeps her intern docs running around at just hilarious.  She is affectionately known as the ""nazi"".  I think of her like a mama bear watching over her cubs.  She is tough and demanding but she takes care of her docs.

I think the current chief resident, played by James Pickens Jr, isn't long for the show.  He already developed a medical condition in Season 1 and has two doc angling for his job.  My bet is that he's gone by Season 2.  It would be a shame because he's got game -- the man can act.  There is a funny moment when he is practicing surgical moves and racing Sandra Oh.  During the warm-ups, she beats him.  During the actual exam, he not only beats her but performs the test with his eyes closed.

(I am deliberately leaving out Alex Carev, played by Justin Chambers.  While he does a great job playing his role, his character is a snake in the grass.)

Oh, about the DVD set.  It is made up of 2 DVDs.  It has a couple of bonus features:  Anatomy of a Plot (the toughest cuts from the pilot episode); Dissecting Grey's Anatomy (unaired scenes); and an Avant-Garde trailer.  The shows are in widescreen format - 1.78:1 and come in Dolby Digital 5:1 Surround sound.

Get this DVD.  You will not be disappointed in the shows...only that the season ends so darn quickly.

PS - Trailers and clips from Season 2 are available on ABC's website.",1145923200,6,3430,4.649415692821369

1546174,5,B00005JO9J,"Grey's Anatomy appeared on Sunday nights on ABC as a mid-season replacement, following the highly-successful Desperate Housewives. By the time the nine-episode first season was finished, it was one of the highest-rated shows on television and it had bumped Boston Legal from the time slot.

This two-disc set captures all nine of the first season episodes with a number of special features thrown in for good measure.

Grey's Anatomy focuses on surgical resident Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her fellow doctors and residents at Seattle Grace Hospital. Meredith is the daughter of one of the most famous female surgeons in history, Ellis Grey, putting a lot of pressure on Meredith. Adding to that pressure is the fact that Ellis is now suffering from Alzheimers and Meredith is struggling to keep that information from her mother's former colleagues. Even more complications arise for Meredith in the pilot when she finds that the man she had a one-night stand with happens to be one of her supervisors, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). This relationship is the key ingredient in the first season of the show, as Meredith at first tries to get rid of the feelings, then embraces them, only to be slammed with a huge surprise in the final minutes of the season.

Pompeo also provides the voice overs for the show, which at times can be rather overbearing, but can also provide just the right mood to establish where the show is coming from. Her character is not the most popular person on television because of the whining, but I think Pompeo does a great job as Meredith, someone obviously dealing with a lot of issues in her life.

Dempsey is also fantastic as Dr. Shepherd, or as Meredith's friends like to call him, Dr. McDreamy. This was a career-reviving role for Dempsey and he nails it perfectly and he gets to provide the biggest surprise of the season as the final episode comes to a close.

Sandra Oh stars at Cristina Yang, the gung-ho resident who sometimes goes a little too far with trying to get the best cases. It is obvious she is a gifted surgeon, but her bedside manner is far from stellar. She comes across as cold and uncaring at times, but viewers do get to see other sides of her. She enters a relationship with a superior, Dr. Preston Burke (Isiah Washington) midway through the season, and that relationship has carried on into season two.

Washington is solid as Dr. Burke. Like Cristina, he is very driven and focused on his work. He has had precious little time for a personal life, which is possibly why he finds Cristina so appealing, as she seems to be just like him.

T.R. Knight's George O'Malley, is my favorite character on the show. He has a huge crush on Meredith, but can't bring himself to tell her. He is a sweet guy, and a good doctor, but his bumbling ways make him appear unsure of himself, especially around women, particularly Meredith. You feel good for George when he goes out with a cute nurse who really likes him, but it comes back to bite him, as he contracts a venereal disease that is spreading through the hospital.

Justin Chambers was added to the cast late as Dr. Alex Karev. Like Cristina, he has very poor bedside manner, but is cocky as all hell when it comes to his surgical skills. He tends to push other people aside and do what he thinks is right, even if other people offer better solutions.

Roswell veteran Katherine Heigl stars as Dr. Izzie Stevens. She paid her way through med school as a model and has to deal with the repercussions of that when Alex finds a magazine spread and posts the photos throughout the hospital. She came from humble beginnings and made herself what she is, which makes her a very likeable character.

James Pickens Jr. stars as Chief of Surgery Richard Webber, the man who oversees all the other doctors on the show. His failing eyesight becomes an issue late in the season, but basically in the first season, he just plays the leader. He gets a much-expanded role in the start of season two, when a former relationship between he and Meredith's mother is revealed.

Chandra Bailey steals the show as Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as the Nazi. She is the supervisor for Meredith and her fellow interns and it is her job to make their days living hells. She obviously cares about the new doctors, but she is tough, not afraid to yell or get mad when the need arises.

This set features two commentary tracks on the pilot, one from creator Shonda Rimes and director Peter Horton, the other from Heigl and Knight, with Oh joining in midway through. There are also a couple of featurettes and a look at a trailer in a foregn language, which is kind of cool.

All in all, although this is a chick show, I enjoyed the set, much like I enjoy the show every Sunday night. It is truly addicting television.",1145750400,4,4799,4.625146886016451
1546175,4,B00005JO9J,"Finally, a show that delivers everything I want...an amazing mix of funny, sexy, poignant, and edgy work.

Grey's sets a new standard for prime time and I think new television shows will no longer be able to be business as usual and be able to compete...thank goodness. These are characters I actually care about and I love how well balanced the show is among a relatively large ensemble cast...each member brings something interesting to the table.

It is has been fun to get to know these actors and watch their careers take off...I love getting in at the ground level like that. I just saw Izzie, Katherine Heigl, in the indie Side Effects (an incredible performance...funny and sexy) and I heard she was just cast in the 40 Year Old Virgin Sequel, Knocked Up.

But considering ER has been pretty much the #1 drama on television for the last 50 years, and Ally McBeal had a super cult following and won 4 Golden Globes, this is a GOOD thing.

I don't watch much television anymore (honest!) ... but Grey's Anatomy is something I'll never miss.  It's a good thing it comes on at 10pm on Sunday, because I'd plan my day around it even if it came on at 2pm on Tuesday.

It's funny, dramatic, melancholy, campy, sometimes implausible but always applaudable ... and if you are just catching it in the second season, the first season is a must have.  Easy to watch and highly entertaining (as well as informative, if you're enjoying the 2nd season but don't quite know what happened between McDreamy and Dr. Grey you need to see it) ...

Especially after what she did to George...I know she had hate mail coming in all sorts of forms for weeks after that.  And I absolutely LOVE that George is moving on with a new love interest.

I can relate to the show so much so because I work in a health-care setting, where gossip spreads faster than fire.  It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it just happens to be heard.

The entire cast is great - not a weak link.  Some standout performances come from T.R. Knight and, especially, Katherine Heigl.  Model/Surgical intern character might seem far-fectched, but she tackles the role with incredible grace and charm.

1546237,5,B00005JO9J,"In recent years I have all but stopped watching medical dramas as I hate to be reminded about what can go wrong.  But Grey's Anatomy piqued my interest from the first episode and hasn't let go since the first episode.  After all what middle aged woman verging on older age would mind looking at Dr. McDreamy for a hours each week.  So with some extra time on my hands I thought I would watch the beginning episodes again when they recently became available.

Again, I was pleased to realize while watching the last four episodes of season 1 why I really enjoy this show week after week. I am one who reads books  and watches movies and TV for character studies and this show has more than enough to satisfy anybody.  I really like the characters, even the angst of both McDreamy and his current girlfriend especially when his wife whom he's separated from shows up at the hospital for a special assignment. And even though it is a no win situation between these three and an angst filled relationships at best, it does make for good TV viewing.

The theme of this show doesn't really differ from those presented in ER, Chicago Hope or even the oldie medical shows like Dr. Kildare and Ben Casey. But it's the cast which makes this a feral hit in my opinion.  Focusing on life in a large Seattle hospital the episodes I viewed are filled with the joys of healing, the agonies of life threatening illnesses and the education of those when they chose their specialty.  And we as viewers are privy to the lives and loves of five surgical interns and their difficult but lovable resident. There are also two dreamy attendants, a wise chief of staff and the mother of one of the residents who is from Alzheimer's.  The cast includes some rather unusual medical situations, i.e. a pregnant man, good writing is good and quirky characters which include a favorite of mine, Sandra Oh.

While TV in real a vast wasteland, as somebody once described it in recent years, this show is a winner for me.  I do hope it continues to beckon to me, and I look forward to watching it and see how the relationships play out.",1144022400,4,2103,4.505263157894737
1546238,5,B00005JO9J,"I was a huge fan of medical shows, such as ER and House MD. I was overjoyed when Grey's Anatomy came out! Grey's Anatomy is even BETTER than the rest of medical shows on TV. I don't even mind staying up on sunday nights to catch an episode of Grey's Anatomy.

The tension between Meredith and Derek (aka Dr. McDreamy) is so intense and sometime unbearable. Plus the other characters in the show are so FRESH and equally entertaining. This is a must have, not just for medical show fans, but for everyone who like drama/comedy.",1143936000,,526,4.479166666666667
1546239,5,B00005JO9J,"This show has a lot of what has been missing from good TV. It has witty characters who have passion for what they do, plots that will make you switch from laughing to crying to being judgemental(of their actions) in the span of minutes!!!! It also has an undeniably talented and DIVERSE cast. Hats off to Shonda Rhimes for having an outstanding vision and being able to carry it out, giving millions of viewers Sunday evening viewing pleasure across America and beyond.

Season 1 is hilarious, serious, and filled with D-R-A-M-A!!!

You are guaranteed to love it!!!",1143936000,,565,4.814432989690721

1546241,5,B00005JO9J,I started watching the second season on tv but never saw how the show got started so I bought the first season.  I watched all episodes in one day.  I could not stop watching it because I was caught up in the story line. Grey's Anatomy is a great series to watch.  I love to watch E.R. but I love Grey's Anatomy even better.,1143590400,,324,4.03125
1546242,5,B00005JO9J,"While its plot may not be revolutionary, new, or partiuclarly breathtaking, the rich and diverse characters of Grey's Anatomy make the show one of the best.

Even if you've never seen the show before, this is still a worthwhile investment. The characters are deep, loveable, and different. Watching their struggles, which are not necessarily unique to television, makes you feel what the characters feel even as they pull you deeper into the immediate and ongoing plots. The endings of each eppisode are nearly always happy, or atleast bittersweet. You'll never feel like you've wasted your time in watching them.

The extras could have been done a bit better. I have to admit, that I was a little dissapointed that there were not more deleted scenes. If I were to rate the extras seperatly, they would only recieve three stars.

Regardless, after watching all nine eppisodes of the first season, I can't wait for season 2 to be realeased!",1143504000,,939,4.930379746835443

The very well-written shows never fail to keep me on the edge of my seat. I've grown to know all of the characters and look forward to seeing them all every week. Give it a try.....you'll get hooked!!",1143331200,,371,4.225352112676056

To give you a sense of my taste in television, my favorite show used to be ""Friends"" (before Grey's Anatomy was created). I also love ""One Tree Hill"" and ""Family Guy.""

And if you don't think you're the slightest bit interested in anything medical, get this anyways because it's more about the drama.. trust me, a lot of the show's followers aren't interested in medicine either. There's a reason why there's so much hype about this show.. IT'S GOOD!!!",1143244800,,679,4.603305785123967

After watching and getting to know the characters I found it great to be able to rewatch the first couple of episodes of the pilot season.  There are things I missed first time around and it was cool picking them up on second viewing.

The bonus features are cool.  I love seeing things that only made it onto the editing room floor.  Sometimes I understand why, others I'm left questioning.

I definitely recommend this DVD series and look forward to being able to purchase Season 2.",1143244800,,598,4.4907407407407405

Yet, there are those moments in every episode when I see the actors address real human emotions and frustrations. That is when I almost forget that I am looking at more of the same sorta St. Elsewhere/ER ""let's play doctor"" trash. This isn't trash....it is entertainment. The cast is almost believable !",1143158400,,381,4.457142857142857

I then found out that I had missed the first season, so I ordered it and am now completely caught up on the background of the show. I work as a nurse in a general hospital and deal with residents everyday. I can tell you that residency is no picnic and they tend to ""hang"" together just like on the show.

This is probably one of the best series I have seen in many, many years! Congrats to ABC for this wonderful show!!",1143072000,,520,4.2

I watch it faithfully every Sunday and it is so much fun to look back and see where it all began - Burke and Cristina, McDreamy and Grey - it's just fantastic. The DVD is a great way to reminisce but it's also great for catching up - if you want to get involved with Grey's, pick this up and get started. I recommend it to everyone - even if you just pause it to stare at Patrick Dempsey.",1143072000,,431,3.909090909090909

1546440,5,B00005JO9J,"No other hospital drama even compares to Grey's Anatomy!  This show is in a class of its own.

This show is focused on a group of new surgical-interns at Seattle Grace Hospital in Washington.  From the very first episode you will find the drama gripping and compelling.  This show picks up where the others fell short.  If you are a fan of doctor shows and have an interest in medical procedures, you will definitely love Grey's Anatomy!  It combines the great drama with very realistic surguries.

Season 1 was a mid-season replacement of another ABC show, so this box set includes two DVDs with all 9 episodes from the first season.  Little did everyone know how well this show would do.  Look for season 2 on DVD soon!

Fans of shows like ER, or how ER was in the beginning, should really love Grey's Anatomy.  You will probably find yourself not being able to quit watching season 1 until you're done with the finale.  This makes for a great weekend movie thing!

I will admit Meredith Grey is a bit whiny but it lends to the vulnerability of her character.  She makes some stupid mistakes but she pays for them.  Each character on the show is so very different.  I am still trying to decide who I can identify with.  I like this series and watching the first season all over again makes me enjoy it even more.

This show is clearly unique, well executed and superbly written. And you will find yourself making up Mc-isms to everything (must watch the show to find out what Mc-isms are).

I will be the first to admit I have never really been in to medical shows. I bought the first season of this DVD set for a couple of reasons. First because I knew it stared Katherine Heigl who stared in one of my favorite Tv shows Roswell, and secondly because I kept hearing buzz and saw how many positive reviews it got here on amazon. I bought the DVD set and WOW was I glad I did. This is a show that has characters so many people can relate to. Grey's Anatomy is a show that has just the right amount of comedy mixed in with just the right amount of drama, and those two things along with the great cast take this far just beyond another medical TV show.

Man was I wrong. I had been hearing raves about the new show so I thought I would force my self to watch at least five minutes of it. After watching only one minute I was hooked. I needed to know every thing about the show. Granted, I came to like the show in the middle of the season I have not missed a single episode.

  There were so many things that I loved about the show. For example, the characters are phenomenal. The viewer really feels as if they know the person that they are watching. Also the character development is another factor that makes Grey's Anatomy one of the best shows on television. The characters grow and make life changes right before your eyes.

  All in all this is one if the best shows on television right now so I advise everyone to start watching.

  The DVD is also amazing. I got it as a present and I had to watch every single show. It did take me a couple of days but I am now finally caught up.

1546610,4,B00005JO9J,"Yes, after such a long wait the DVD of Grey's Anatomy finally arrived in my neighborhood video store. I was eager to see it for the simple reason that I am a devoted fan of Canadian Diva Sandra Oh whom I have followed since Double Happiness. She's right, she can never get any good roles in Hollywood films since she relocated, and doing a series like Grey's Anatomy is the best job she's gotten. Even though the top billing of this series went to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey, it was Oh who delivered the most memorable performance that's so worthy of her Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards. Well, so far I have only seen five episodes, so my review is more of an introductory. There's romance, educational moments, comedy, and tender moments in it's first five episodes. The gay patient teasing George was funny. The sneeky makeout sessions in the elevator between Meredith and Derek was thrilling and romantic. The ""Dr. Supermodel/Addison"" rescuing the illegal immigrant patient was a heartfelt experience. Then I was moved to tears when Cristina(Sandra Oh) couldn't save the live of the old black nurse. All I can say is that I am a film buff, and I was rather amazed that I enjoyed this series so much, and I definitly want to rent the rest of the first season.",1140480000,,1279,4.638766519823789

The only thing I dislike about the DVD set: If you choose an episode to watch, you have to go back to the main menu after you start the episode and turn off the subtitles. (I've tried turning them off and then choosing the episode but it doesn't work.) It's just a little annoying. There's also no scene selection feature. Again, another small annoyance.

But again, the show is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good medical drama.

(And I don't think they all put down nurses. Alex does, yes, but he's a pig. I think Meredith was reacting to the fact that he called her a nurse when she is a doctor and the only reason he made that comment was because he is a pig.

Not only is this show completely cheesy, predictable and cliche-ridden, but it also demonstrates contempt for nursing.

Alex- Like I said, I hate nurses.

Meredith- What did you just say? Did you just call me a nurse?

Alex- Well if the white cap fits...

The characters treatment of nurses is horrible. The show depicts tham as mindless drones, unable to do anything unless a doctor tells them to.

This show also pokes fun at other professions. Such as Kindergarten teaching and postal work.

The characters are so arrogant that I cannot stand to watch this show.

I definitely would not recommend this show. Anyway, it will probably die-off if it gets severed from Desperate Housewives.

It's kind of nice to see that people in high-stress situations (as surgery obviously would be) go through a lot of the same crap we do.  I think it's a combination of great actors/actresses and wonderful writing.  It really shows the human side of medicine without forgetting the professional.  I also like that, while I don't always understand all of the terms, it doesn't go over my head.  The writing is geared to the audience, not just medical professionals.

I used to watch ER on occasion and thought that it was a really good show. But with ""Grey's"" i literally didn't want to miss an episode. I found myself setting a time slot in my day to watch it that i missed maybe twice but always caught up with on another day.

Understand that i have a very busy schedule which is why i watch DVDs alot - i can watch them whenever. But during the week, if i watch any tv it's hap-hazard. This, however, i refused to miss.

FUNNY, SHOCKING, EXCITING, HEART-RACING.

This show works so well because its so realistic, so human and you relate so much to the characters - they're learning, they're making mistakes and living life where they have to soldier on because they have responsibilities.

In 9 episodes it became (through ratings and polls) the most addictive TV show for years upon years.

And you may notice that ER was supposed to be finished. Done. Gone. For good. But 5 episodes into Grey's second series and ER mysteriously shows up again with a new series. And low and behold its ratings are actually down from their last recorded numbers.

The plot is not overly complicated, but what really makes this show different, when comparing it to others, is the superb cast and of course the great storylines. ""Grey's anatomy"" tells us about the lives of five surgical interns: Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), ""Izzie"" Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Christina Yang (Sandra Oh), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight ) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Moreover, we also get to know about their teachers, teachers that in the case of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) become much more than that.

In one of the many episodes that this dvd has, Meredith says that ""We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still sometimes we have to see for ourselves. We have to make our own mistakes. We have to learn our own lessons. We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore. Until we finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin really meant. That knowing is better than wondering, that waking is better than sleeping, and even the biggest failure, even the worst, beats the hell out of never trying"". Please give this dvd a try as soon as it is released. You won't regret it! Of course, highly recommended...

something real and special to this show and I think mostly because of

The world of pretend is a cage, not a cocoon. We can only lie to ourselves for so long. We are tired, we are scared, denying it doesn't change the truth. Sooner or later we have to put aside our denial and face the world. Head on, guns blazing. De Nile. It's not just a river in Egypt, it's a freakin' ocean. So how do you keep from drowning in it?"" Ellen Pompeo plays  Meredith Grey, a surgical intern, new to Seattle and Grace Hospital.

The shows title is a reference to the famous anatomy book ""Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body"" by Henry Gray. Well known by all in the health care field, and very well memorized by all medical students. The music from each show is well worth listening to, most of it is new and on the top of the charts.

""Greys Anatomy"" can be a play on words. Meredith is finding herself, not only in the surgical world, but in her personal life. Her mother is a surgeon suffering from Alzheimer's, her father is dead. She falls in love with the handsome Chief Neurosurgeon, Dr. Derek Shepard played by Patrick Dempsey. She later finds out he is married to a pediatric surgeon. Her new roommates are all surgical interns: T.R. Knight as bumbling, inept, George O'Malley; Sandra Oh, as  Cristina Yang , one of my favorites, and Katherine Heigl as Isobel ""Izzie"" Stevens. Cristina Yang has a one night affair with the hunky,Chief Surgical Resident, Preston Burke; that moves onto ""true"" lust. They are so diametrically different that the old saying"" opposites attract"" is, oh, so true.  And, then, there is ""The Nazi"",Chandra Wilson as Dr. Miranda Bailey. She whips the new interns into shape and keeps them on their toes. It turns out she has a heart as big as Kansas, but then, don't they all?

The show is funny, has lots of drama, unrealistic at times and then more than real at other times. The workings of a real hospital? I will leave that for you to decide. The drama of every day in  the life of a surgical intern. Too much work, too little time, but these interns always find time for the personal stories of their patients and, this is where the shows true colors come shining through. The humanness of physicians and the people they care for; the love and dedication it takes to help someone become well, and the sadness and gloom of a death.  The open heart surgery in an elevator by a first year surgical intern is hard to believe, but somehow it works.  This is a TV show that works as well. The personalities ring true; we like them, we want them to succeed. Highly recommended. prisrob",1136678400,12,2661,4.436475409836065

It provides dramatic and fun occurrences in the lives of the cast as well as insight into their medical cases.  The personal touch on the lives of the characters and exciting hospital scenes has kept me waiting impatiently for each episode.

I absolutely love this show and can imagine that it would interest audiences of all ages.",1135814400,3,454,4.782051282051282
1546790,5,B00005JO9J,"Grey's Anatomy is the tale of a group of surgeons (more or less) at Seattle Grace Hospital. At the center of it all is Merrideth Grey, a new intern who begins the show by leaving her one-night-stand with the boss-she-didn't-know-at-the-time, Dr. Derek Shepherd. As you can imagine, this turns into a major plot line for the entire season (and the next). It isn't long until we are also introduced to Merrideth's mother, one of the best neurosurgeon's of our time, and a closet victem of Alzheimer's. Then Merrideth has her friends and coworkers: Izzy, George, Cristina, and Alex, who have their own woes and troubles.

  The show has a sense of quick wit, and moves pretty fast. The patients and relationships keep it interesting, while the characters make it easy to relate. It has a rather large amount of sexual relations throughout (the first episode begins with a one night stand; the last revolves around an STD running rampid through the hospital, and every episode between dealing with some affair or another between the residents and interns), but there are always reprocussions. So while it's not for the sexually rigid, it is great for the masses.",1135728000,3,1158,4.8979591836734695

The humour is good and the story lines are good, but it's just not gripping enough.  I'm hoping that Dr Shepherd (Dempsey) will come to his senses and get back with Grey (Pompeo), but who knows.  They'll keep us on the edge of our seats for this I'm sure.  Anyway, for a bit of lighthearted fluff, this would be a good choice for you.  For something along the lines of ER, skip it.",1135555200,,613,4.25

I can't believe that Touchstone/Buena Vista is rushing this to market (on Valentine's Day, no less) but are still stiffing us by not releasing the far superior Season Three of ""Once And Again"" (originally scheduled for 1/10/06, now indefinitely postponed.) In fact, Buena Vista touts ""Once And Again"" in the press release for the DVD set of ""Grey's,"" while still stalling on releasing the third season of ""O&A"" on DVD. Hypocrisy in the extremus, if you ask me. (You're reading this review, aren't you?) Come on Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Get off your high horse and give us quality DVD, not this twaddle. If you want to see a real medical show, drop what you're doing, and write or e-mail 20th Century Fox and ask them to release the last five seasons of ""St. Elsewhere"" on DVD.",1135555200,6,864,4.65359477124183
1546854,5,B00005JO9J,"I'm a huge fan of medical dramas and originally I really didn't see how this show could differ itself from any other average medical show. I got hooked in the first five minutes and I've been watching ever since. Now that ER is sort of past its prime Grey's Anatomy can easy claim the title as the best medical drama on television.

What really differs the show from any other medical show I've seen is the character development. The character development helped keep me interested and I felt I got to know Meredith and the other interns. I also got a feel for the hardships being an intern is and how much work goes into becoming a doctor. You also get a feeling of connection with the interns because of how much we find out about them. Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Bailey, and Dr. Burke help them along the way and offer some good advice. It's very informative and I've learned a few things watching it.

Overall I think Grey's Anatomy is one of the best and most addictive shows on TV right now. This DVD is a great way to see it from the beginning and it's priced right and I highly recommend it.",1135123200,124,1090,4.338235294117647

I have never missed an episode, will not let anyone interupt my Sunday night viewing, and have sat here salivating while waiting to see when Season 1 will be out!

The show has amazing depth mixed with hilarious comments and situations. Each character is written and acted with such realistic qualities that I feel like my best friends have left when each show is over.

This is by far, one of the best drama's in a long time.",1135123200,9,544,4.271844660194175
1546856,5,B00005JO9J,"I look forward to watching this show every Sunday night, the perfect end to a weekend, light heartedly funny, yet emotionally charged. What makes this show so special? You could say it's the incredibly talented cast, the funny, sometimes out of this world plot lines. Who can ever forget the pregnant man! Perhaps it's how beautifully put together this show is, from the music to the ending monologues that connect these character's stories by glimpsing into their lives when they are most vulnerable, this show finds a way to leave you satisfied after every episode and simultaneously craving the next.

Dempsey plays the perfect tragic hero, Katherine Heigle is perfect as the conscience of the show, Sandra Oh plays her role of a determined intern lacking complete interpersonal skills, so seamlessly and Pompeo finds a way to play her lonely character in a way where we don't have to feel sorry for her. I can go on and on....but I guess the point is that the cast has a certain chemistry that when all together their acting seems effortless.

With the wave of crime-scene/investigation shows it's nice to have another high quality medical show that I believe can stand right up there with ER. I have to warn you though that this show is not an imitation of ER, it's much more light hearted, yet has these poignant moments of epiphany where you know that the character as grown in some way.  The show is based around five interns making their way through rounds, gaining experience and testing not only their abilities but their will, and confidence to believe in themselves and each other.

The first season of Grey's Anatomy is a short one as it was a second-half season filler that exceeded all expectations with it's strong ratings, but don't worry I heard that the DVD's are loaded with extras like commentaries, behind the scenes, and unaired scenes.  The second season so far continues to entertain...and I mean this, you will be entertained...you will laugh out loud!",1135036800,5,1979,4.84319526627219

When I saw commercials for it, I thought, hm...something different, so I decided to watch it.  Now I'm addicted.  I haven't missed one episode, it's just that good.  The relationships between all the interns make the show interesting.  You never want to miss a show, because you want to keep up with the characters.",1135036800,4,468,4.5
1546858,5,B00005JO9J,"When teasers were first aired for this show last season, I couldn't have been less interested.  I wasn't familiar with any of the main actors so no one caught my attention nor am I particularly fond of ""hospital"" shows.  I made no effort to catch the pilot but somehow found myself in front of the television when it came on.  After the first 15 minutes, I was seriously hooked and haven't dared to miss an episode since -- it's THAT good!  This is the only television show I actually watch while it's airing.  Normally, if I want to watch something, I'll record it for later viewing (commercials drive me crazy) but ""Grey's Anatomy"" is the one show I HAVE to watch along with 20+ million other people in America.  I love all of the regular characters and am consistently amazed by their overall chemistry with each other.  Having said that, I am especially impressed by, and adore, Sandra Oh who plays Cristina Yang.  In a stellar cast, she is a standout.  She's acerbic, witty, carelessly abrupt and totally unlearned in the art of diplomacy, but in her few moments of vulnerability (usually with the coolly skillful Dr. Burke or with her ""sister""/close friend Meredith), she has been wonderful and touching.  She deserves an Emmy -- they're all so good but she is a consistent scene stealer.  Her timing and delivery are perfect.  As Cristina, she always makes me laugh but she sometimes also breaks my heart.  I had never seen any of Sandra's work before but am a fan of hers for life now.  She and the tough but nurturing Dr. Miranda Bailey, along with sweet but awkward George O'Malley, are my absolute favorites in a cast that has melded together into a well-oiled machine.  I cannot praise this show or its talented cast enough and it seems I'm not in the minority here.  I'm pleased to learn that so many others love and have embraced this show and all of the flawed but endearing characters as much as I have.  Can't wait for the DVDs of last season and this season.

This show will take you to the brink of tears and then throw in the perfect peice of comedy right in the middle of the drama to lightin it up.  I give the writers of this show alot of credit they are very good at what they do, and the cast is just amazing, this show is extemely well done.

1546861,5,B00005JO9J,"For those of you tired of flipping through channels (or in this case, surfing the web) because nothing good is on television, look no further. Grey's Anatomy is a smart dramedy with as much wit as it has heart. The only thing more watch-able than the pretty faces are the storylines viewers will love to get tangled up in.

 Season one starts out with the introduction of the show's heroin Meredith Grey [Ellen Pompeo] getting herself into a hilariously messy situation (I won't give it away, but let's just say Dr. Derek Shepard [Patrick Dempsey] looks just as good in the morning as he does in his doctor's scrubs). What happens in the first scene of the series sets the story for the rest of the season. Pompeo gives an honest performance (we never feel like she's acting, and we can't help but want her to succeed in her endeavors).

 The show's supporting cast consisting of Sandra Oh paired with Isaiah Washington is one of the show's most pleasant surprises. There is a spark between these two by the second or third episode that viewers will notice (perhaps even before the writers did?) leading one to root for them to get together as well.

Other TV buffs may recognize Katherine Heigl from the now defunct (but equally as great) Roswell. Heigl plays an intern/part time model that is strong willed and intelligent. In season one there are hints of a relationship between her and fellow bad-boy intern, Alex (you may recognize him as Masimo, the goofy Italian guy from the Jennifer Lopez flick ""The Wedding Planner""). Is she just what he needs to show a softer side of himself?

 With smart writing and likable characters, this show has the gripping medical dilemmas of ""ER,"" the solid camaraderie of ""Friends,"" and the heart of ""Gilmore Girls."" Buy season one, and catch season two on ABC, Sunday nights at 10:00 PM.",1131494400,18,1827,4.70846394984326

1546884,5,B00005JO9J,"I discovered ""Grey's Anatomy"" the same way that I've discovered almost all of my favorite shows - by mistake.  In 2003 when most of my favorite shows closed up shop for the last time, I really didn't think I would stay into television the way I had... But with the help of great shows like ""Grey's Anatomy,"" I think I have become more obsessed.

With only 9 episodes in the first season (despite the fact that 13 where filmed), ""Grey's Anatomy"" was able to drag viewers in like nothing before... Commanding upwards of 18 million viewers a night right out of the gate, it was a force to be reconded with.

The show follows a group of five surgical interns during there first year of residency, focusing around the character or Meredith Grey (whos mother was the most succeful surgen to ever step foot in that hospital) who has to deal with not only the rigors of her residency, but a complicated love-life, and her mother's alteimzers aswell.

Surrounding Meredith are four other residence, all of whom she shares her home with including: the super model, the angry chinese woman, the dorky geek, and the playboy

""Grey's Anatomy"" which the excpetion of oviously having a single main character is reminiscient of the best years of ""ER"" but from right out of the gate.",1131321600,20,1266,4.6591928251121075
1546885,4,B00005JO9J,"Grey's Anatomy may not be a hard-hitting medical drama, nor is it even a very realistic portrayal of hospitals or medicine, but it's not meant to be ER or Chicago Hope. Rather than giving us a slice-of-life portrayal of surgeons and hospitals, Grey's Anatomy uses the medical setting as a metaphor for the human dramas being experienced by the doctors, particularly the new crop of interns (one of whom, Sandra Oh, is awesomely sarcastic and ambitious).

The cast overall is very strong, and unfortunately it's been universally noted that the weak link is the lead, Ellen Pompeo, whose voiceovers giving us the ""life lesson of the day"" may be the main detractor of the show. The outlandish medical cases are again not meant to be taken literally so much as they provide metaphors for real life and mirror what's going on with the doctors' relationships.

Yes, there's a lot of romance and sex going on for one hospital, and it gets a bit wrapped up in the romantic-drama elements, but the characters and their relationships are strongly portrayed and the storylines move briskly. None of that will-they-or-won't-they wishy-washiness that draws out tensions forever and frustrates the viewer's patience. And whenever the tone veers toward the overly dramatic, the comedy undercuts it and brings us back.

Not quite cutting-edge or groundbreaking television, but very enjoyable and entertaining to watch. The mostly adult-indie-rock soundtrack is a little obvious and occasionally overused to the point of being intrusive, but for the most part works well with the show. Some particularly nice choices in Season 1 are Tegan and Sara, Rilo Kiley, The Ditty Bops, Wilco, Nellie McKay, and Iron & Wine.

Season 1 was originally supposed to be 13 episodes, but ABC only aired the first 9, then held back the rest and used them to open Season 2. It's not clear if this will be a 9-episode or 13-episode set, but at this price it's a good deal either way.",1131062400,11,1947,4.926829268292683
