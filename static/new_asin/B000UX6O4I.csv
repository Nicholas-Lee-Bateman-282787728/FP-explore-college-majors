8592355,1,B000UX6O4I,This doc wasn't good at all.  It was cheaply made using mostly pictures of The Game taken from the internet with a not so experienced narrator in the background that didn't have all the facts right or in order.  The only decent part of this horrible DVD was the reenactment of The Game getting shot in his apartment if you take out the bad acting and really fake blood.  I wouldn't recommend this DVD to any The Game fan,1202342400,,420,4.291139240506329
8592356,5,B000UX6O4I,"This documentary on the game is trully fascinating. Before this documentary I really wasn't feeling this gang banger from compton. After watching the DVD I found a new respect for this guy. I admire how he changed his life after being shot. This documentary was better than the one that DR DRE & 50 cents did. Those guys need to contact the Producer/ Director of this joint. They even did cool reenactments on a unauthorized  dvd. Man- after watching this film... I'm definately checking for all of the GAme's work from now on.
