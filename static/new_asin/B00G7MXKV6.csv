8621267,4,B00G7MXKV6,I really found this movie to be very interesting and in the end moving and sad.  I think it requires a degree of empathy from the viewer to appreciate what June and especially Joe are going through and sometimes that requires us to not be so self-righteous about how we would react in a given situation or who we would or would not be attracted to.  One reviewer referred to Joe as a 'Chicken Hawk' but did not categorize Junes' attraction to Joe in a like derogatory manner.  Another reviewer would have preferred the movie to have tied up everything neatly. I would only say that at least in my experience life doesn't always work that way. Human emotions are complicated and who we are attracted to is not really under our control unless you buy into the 'free will' argument.,1408579200,2,779,4.51063829787234
8621268,4,B00G7MXKV6,I gave it the four stars because I was good but left me wondering. I wonder what if a lot. I dod not like that when i watch a movie. I want it to be finished by the director not by my mind.,1403136000,,189,3.4186046511627906
8621269,5,B00G7MXKV6,"The four main cast were believe able. I would have loved to seen the play, smart, witty, scary and daring.",1394582400,,106,4.35
8621270,2,B00G7MXKV6,"The story takes place on the fourth of July and centers on the lives of four people. Four is also the number used to establish a foundation. We see people who are trapped by their lives on a day they celebrate freedom. Joe (Wendell Pierce) a chicken hawk, meets June (Emory Cohen) on line. June is a quiet confused young man who feels trapped by his homosexuality. Joe is a family man who can not come out either. His wife has a ""disease"" which we guess is HIV she got from Joe. Abigayle [sic] is Joe's daughter who cares for her mother while dad claims he is Boston. Young Dexter is mixed White and Hispanic. He convinces Abigayle to come out and see him. He played basketball as a youth and it appears his best days are behind him.

Even understanding the symbolism/metaphor the film sets up, I still didn't enjoy it. An art/ concept film based on a play.

8621271,1,B00G7MXKV6,"I just didn't get it, and somewhere while watching this movie I started not to care about any of the characters. Some people love these type of movies, but I feel like I just wasted an hour/30 of my time.",1388966400,2,204,4.125
8621272,5,B00G7MXKV6,"Fans of the landmark U.S. television series The Wire, devotees of truly independent filmmaking & open-minded movie lovers of all stripes will be riveted by Joshua Sanchez's narrative, Four.  All four principals bring authentic and compelling characterizations to the screen, and you will be mesmerized by Wendell Pierce's fearlessness. Watching this film reminded me of how I felt when I first discovered Poe or Faulkner or O'Connor in my youth. I was uncomfortable. I was stunned. I was left with provocative questions. And I wanted more. I wanted more because I felt a thrill that I later understood to be the joy of experiencing challenging, spellbinding artistry. Mr. Sanchez and his company have delivered just that with Four, an enthralling and yes, controversial, film that powerfully depicts the emotional lengths to which many of us will go to cope with life's disappointments and to feel connected.",1384732800,6,908,5.219178082191781
