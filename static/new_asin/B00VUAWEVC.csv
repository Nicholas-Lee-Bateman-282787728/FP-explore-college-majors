Not a bad movie for it did hold our attention to the very end.",1443657600,,250,4.122448979591836
7112096,5,B00VUAWEVC,"Boy meets girl. Girl beats up boy silly. They fall in love.

This wacky, unconventional romantic comedy first takes place at the beach of their seaside community. There, a French Army recruiter asks for volunteers to give a hand to hand fight demonstration. The lead character, Arnaud, played by Kevin Azais  makes the first step to volunteer. She, Madeleine, played by Adele Haenel, makes the next step. Arnaud tells the recruiter that he doesn't fight girls. She then lounges at him, twisting and twirling him into a pretzel. Once she has whipped him, she then stands up as the victor. He slinks humbly back to stand alongside his friends.

Soon after, he meets her again. This time, while working with his brother as a carpenter to build a trellis for her parents' backyard patio next to the build-in swimming pool.  He acknowledges her. Eventually, they connect.

She's a tomboy, and he's a sensitive young man: an ideal match. When she finally opens up, she tells him her doomsday apocalypse philosophy of life: survival of the fittest. He simply lends a friendly ear.

Yet her gung-ho, combative, take no prisoner instinct makes her behave oddly. For example, to improve her health and strength, she puts a fresh mackerel into her blender. Then she woofs down the squished, chopped fish. She's a self-acclaimed survivalist: a tough cookie. That's why this movie is funny: her bizarre, oddball weirdo behavior to his straight-laced, normal guy behavior shows opposite attracts causing a big bang love affair.

The romance takes flight when they sign up for a military training camp for two weeks. She wants to learn survival skills and tactics. At the camp, they live in separate barracks. During training, they engage in paintball warfare, undergo strenuous physical training, and follow orders.

Yet the military camp is not tough enough for her. She complains to the women in her barracks that the beds are way too soft to survive in a harsh, bitter, competitive environment.

Off-beat humor carries the plot. Director Thomas Cailley, beside his acute ears for dialogue, also has sharp eyes. He adroitly uses the environment, especially the forest and the river, to tell logically this tale of a rough and ready tomboy and her complacent companion.

Both actress and actor, Haenel, and Azais, are brilliant. They are playing characters, who are not run of the mill ordinary, at least she's not typical. Yet, they manage to connect. They find ways to deal with the vagaries of everyday life.

In French, the movie is called ""Les Combattants,"" translation means ""The Fighters."" Yet the movie is funny, despite the doomsday attitude of Madelieine. Funny in an absurdist, bizarre, oddball way: dry humor.

Even though the characters are in their early twenties with bleak futures, rotten economy, this movie is well suited for everyone of all ages. It's funny as long as the viewer realizes it's a comedy: it's a gender bender. The first clue this movie was a gender bender was when the attractive actress Haenel stood up above Azais beaten, bruised, fallen body on the sand.

In front of all of his incredulous friends, she struts back triumphantly to the recruiter. Now he had a real reason for not wanting to fight a girl.",1442275200,3,3229,4.946395563770795
8711302,4,B00VUAWEVC,"This isn't an action film or a Stripes style military, or Police Academy set in the French army comedy film, but it's still a nice film.  Basically we start off in some small French coastal town where opportunities for the young aren't great, we learn that our main male character's friend is moving to Canada for a future, and the only thing Arnaud maybe has a chance at a economic stability is in is his father's business, which his brother is now running since their father's recent death.  He and his mates one by one have sat through an army recruitment truck's speech in exchange for a free inflatable mattress, because they're just bored. Upon his return from the truck Arnaud is surprised that his friends have signed him up for an impromptu beach wrestling match, with a crowd pressuring him he reluctantly gets into the ring.  However his opponent is a girl, he doesn't want to fight her, so she quickly has him on the ground. Humiliated he bites her so she'll get off him.  Not long after he tags along with his brother to try and sell a pool hut where he learns the clients' daughter Madeleine is the same girl.  She naturally doesn't like him one bit, but he clearly sees something in her.  He learns she is a paranoid the world is about to end survivalist type and plans to join the army to learn survival skills, she has signed onto what she thinks is a hardcore training camp that is compulsory if you want to become a paratrooper.  He pretends he's interested in this sort of thing and becomes her friend. Of course he secretly signs up for the course too.  However the course is more like an American kids summer camp than what Madeline had expected, she points out every ridiculous piece of advice she is given which makes her quite unpopular. Arnaud however is becoming the most popular trainee.  But this isn't the way to get the girl.

Although nothing really happens in the movie, and both Madeleine and Arnaud are quite flawed, it's still a decent enough watch.  If you're not expecting it to be a comedy or an action film and instead just the character interaction film it is, than you'll probably enjoy it.",1468713600,,2132,4.54046997389034
8711303,2,B00VUAWEVC,"I actually rate it 2.5 stars, because there were things about this film that kept my interest.  The biggest flaw of this film is the main female character is downright unlikable.  She's seriously weird, aggressive, abrasive, and completely socially illiterate...even creepy at times.  It was very hard to understand what the hero saw in her - A problem because the movie is largely based on his infatuation with her.  Worse, the film provides absolute no background or insight into her psyche or behavior, or delve into why she is the way she is, at all.  Absent that, it would have really helped if she'd been even remotely appealing - had some flicker of wit or charisma - something to grasp onto and root for her - but she didn't, so I just didn't care about her.  By contrast, and thankfully, the hero is appealing and sympathetic, and I did feel more invested in his journey, which is why I stuck it out to the end.",1465862400,,920,4.545454545454546
8711304,4,B00VUAWEVC,"I rented ""Love at First Fight"" (""Les Combattants"") due to the starring role of Adle Haenel, who had supporting roles in two recent Film Movement movies I enjoyed:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliyah-English-Subtitled/dp/B016NPQGFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliyah (English Subtitled)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Worlds-English-Subtitled/dp/B011N3GY8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Worlds (English Subtitled)</a>.  In both cases, even though her role was small, you couldn't take your eyes off her when she appeared on screen.

Filmmaker Thomas Cailley has clearly recognized that attraction and put her in this movie as his lead.  She doesn't disappoint.  While Les Combattants doesn't measure up to either of the two movies I mentioned above (especially 'Three Worlds' which is fantastic), it's still a well worth your time to catch this rising star.

Kvin Azas is likable and winning as Haenel's character's admirer, Arnaud.  At first left slack-jawed by Madeleine's (Haenel) combination of beauty and strength, he rallies to become her unlikely champion.

The cover box screams out ""feel good comedy!""  But this is a subtler, sweeter film than that, not one going for big guffaws.",1458345600,,1299,6.783132530120482

8711309,2,B00VUAWEVC,"Don't get me wrong, I love French movies, and usually a Cannes award is a sign of a superior movie.
This one, alas, is pointless, muddled and disappointing, and the trailer is completely misleading. The movie is about a misfit girl with antisocial tendencies deciding (rightly) that a two week training course prior to joining a parachute regiment is a joke - the food is plastic junk, the living conditions are fairly comfortable, not at all what one would expect for a paratroop regiment, and the training a joke. The senior officer, too, is a caricature. But what happens next is completely implausible and ludicrous - what you would expect a pair of 14 year-olds to do. Perhaps the director was trying to be allegorical, but if so just failed dismally. By the time you make it through the apocalyptic episode and ending you'll just shake your head at this mess.",1449273600,,865,4.735099337748345
