8745388,3,B019JGOR9A,Great to have a complete set of Dvorak symphonies on DVD and the performances themselves are excellent. What lets this set down is the menu. Each movement is preceded by an introduction which may be of interest once but not on repeated hearing. Sure there is an option to play the symphonies without the introduction but selecting this option just starts to play the DVD from the beginning. That means to hear the even numbered symphonies on each disc one has to fast forward all the way through the preceding symphony,1523059200,,518,4.7032967032967035

8745391,3,B019JGOR9A,"This set of the complete Dvorak symphonies was recorded live at the Dvorak Hall, the Rudolfinum, in Prague during 2014. That was shortly after the same artists recorded the complete symphonies plus the three concertos for Decca and which is now available as a similarly priced CD box set. That much praised set on Decca, recorded under studio conditions, is the reason that this video set has been released as a DVD set and will not be issued as a Blu-ray set. The cost of producing the set for Blu-ray would be prohibitively too high with such direct competition inevitably affecting likely sales.

The obvious differences between the two sets therefore are the recording circumstances (studio versus live performance and recording), the playback features (audio stereo versus high definition video plus surround sound options - digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1) and extra content (the concertos versus documentary material).

To take the latter element first: the documentary features of the new DVD set may well prove to be significantly attractive to potential purchasers as they are thorough, well done and both interesting as well as being educational. There is considerable musical analysis provided for each movement of every symphony lasting around 4 minutes in each case where Belohlavek discusses the music with a colleague. This is within a fairly informal setting but delivers performance illustrations as well as notational examples to support the musical descriptions. The complete performances of the symphonies can be heard with or without these introductions. There is also a 45 minute documentary, Sketches of Dvorak, shot within Czechoslovakia and which covers aspects of the composers life and key moments during his life. Once more this is both informative and interesting with much input from the conductor.

The recording of the new set, as mentioned earlier, is in HD but will only be available as a set of 5 DVDs due to cost and marketing considerations. The visual reproduction is crisp but the sound, although available in surround as well as stereo, is compromised by the live nature of the venture as a result of the characteristics of the venue. The orchestra is arrayed upon a stage that barely has enough space for it and where the lower strings are spread across the back along with the timpani. The result is a lack of sonic clarity compared to studio recordings made earlier and sometimes much earlier. The timpani tend to overwhelm much of the orchestra at climatic points and the somewhat indistinct bass frequencies compromise much of the middle range of the orchestra at similar climatic points especially. This hall, while being of considerable historical significance, does not favour the acoustic clarity found in more modern buildings. Collectors familiar with renowned studio recordings made by Szell (1950s-1960s), Kertesz (1960s-1970s), Suitner and Jarvi (1970s-1980s) to take a few examples will not find such clarity here.

Belohlavek clearly loves and admires this music. This affects the way he presents it which emphasises its lyrical nature. That lyrical emphasis leads the conductor to take a relatively leisurely view of the tempi throughout and to make less of the dramatic content. This may well be a valid viewpoint and relates strongly to the Bohemian landscape which so influenced the composer. However this is only part of the story. Dvorak was also a highly dramatic writer whose writing features biting use of the brass, incisive use of percussion and energetic folk dance ingredients for effect. His late symphonic poems are often based upon gruesome folk tales and these are vividly portrayed with considerable drama and relish. These intensely dramatic features are also integral to his symphonic output and that emphasis is markedly lacking in Belohlaveks concept as heard here. Those looking for that sort of drama to be found in considerable amounts in the highlighted versions above by Szell, Kertesz, Suitner and Jarvi amongst many others will not find it here.

This then is a set with particular and specific attractions. The documentary element is extensive and will be found by many to be of considerable value. The essentially lyrical nature of the performances is typical of this conductor and will be liked by those who share that view. Many though, may find these readings to be dramatically compromised to a damaging extent. The recording venue does not help in this regard and may have masked incisive details which may have been played but which have been lost in the acoustics of the hall. Only by making direct comparisons with the equivalent Decca studio set, not possible on this occasion, could this be fully assessed.

In summary, this set offers completeness in many ways but Dvorak as a composer of symphonic drama is notably absent.",1457740800,11,4814,5.149616368286445
