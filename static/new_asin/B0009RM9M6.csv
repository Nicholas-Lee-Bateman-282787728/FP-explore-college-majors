disappointed. This is for beginner player but not so appealing.",1217116800,2,134,4.869565217391305
8065567,5,B0009RM9M6,"The people at homespun videos are making the best training dvd's. The Dr. John dvd's are the best ever and are well worth the money. This guy is great. He takes some getting use to. He must be a music teacher somewhere, if he's still alive. I have his other video on rock & roll piano. Both are filled with great licks and information on the history of piano playing. I highly recommend this dvd, his rock and roll dvd, and all the Dr. John dvd's (4) from homespun. If you are a music teacher, get these dvd's for all students, not just piano players. I have been informed by Bob Hoban, that he is still alive!! Great news Bob. Anymore videos on the way?",1203638400,6,654,4.24
