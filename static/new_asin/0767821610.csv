19833,5,0767821610,"Another of my very favorite movies available on Fire TV.  I am so thrilled.  I can't wait to watch this movie, and hope that it hasn't been edited.  I saw the original in the theater, and there is a major sub-plot about Donald being gay.  That was cut out of the video years ago.  I hope it's back.

Tommy Lee Jones is my hands-down favorite actor.  Too bad he was so little used during his younger years.  He was awesome.",954633600,,422,4.1875

19880,5,0767821610,"Just finished watching ""The Eyes Of Laura Mars"" released by Columbia Pictures.
I was a bit surprised to learn that not only did John Carpenter co-write the original screen play for this unique movie which deftly mixes the genres of suspense, crime, horror, and romance into a highly intriguing movie that is a sly commentary not only on glamorizing death to sell merchandise; but of those who create the demand for the desensitization of violence and sexuality to increase a product's bottom line; but John Carpenter also came up with the original story as well.
Also of note is the fact the Barbara Streisand was originally cast in the role of Laura Mars; but she decided not to take the role.  It would have been interesting to see her take on Laura Mars.  Sadly, I don't think any test footage of her in the role of Laura Mars exists.  If it does, it would make an interesting extra on any future blue-ray DVD release.
Laura Mars, as portrayed by Faye Dunaway, is a high end New York City fashion photographer who has found widespread commercial success through her color and black and white photographs which glamorize death and murder.  Only the death begins to strike very close to Laura when her publisher is murdered and Laura sees the murder in a nightmare.
Soon Laura's nightmares become psychic visions as she is forced to  witness each murder of her friends and colleagues in horrific detail.  Laura soon learns that her work is recreations of violent murders across the city - murders that the police have kept hidden from the general public.
And while the police know Laura is committing the murder of her co-workers and friends; her own research shows that the last person reported to have her gift died in an insane asylum in the 1800s.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing things about ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" is that it somehow got away with an R-Rating, instead of an X-rating.  There are plenty of topless young women and there are LGBT undertones throughout the entire move - including a double murder of two lesbian models.
There is a taunt, gritty realism to ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" which makes it a masterpiece of psychological suspense with a slight mix of the supernatural.  Laura's glamour shots are intertwined with the poorer sections of New York  City and her friends and co-workers live glamour lives amidst the  hobble.
It would be interesting to see a remake of ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" made for the Social Media Age.  I'm surprised this movie has yet to be remade.
Highly Recommended!

The movie is an edgy, beautifully done thriller.  It holds up far better than most to the test of time.  It's interesting to see the back drop of NYC when it was at its physical low point.

20065,4,0767821610,"This highly implausible but irresistibly fun suspense thriller has lots to recommend it, starting with its novel premise involving a famous fashion photographer who begins to see murders as they happen--through the murderer's eyes (this same premise is also responsible for some of the film's lovably ludicrous moments).

Dunaway is the photographer, and her performance--as usual--elevates the material tenfold, even though she is hardly at her best here. But will Faye let bad styling and unflattering camera angles get in the way of her customary dedication to the role? Never!

Among the film's other assets are all the time-capsule location shots in Manhattan, the now-quaint disco soundtrack, the Helmut Newton-style ""photo session scenes"", and a strong supporting cast which includes Tommy Lee Jones as a homicide detective who becomes romantically involved with the titular Miss Mars.

The plot at times stretches believability to ludicrous heights, such as when Dunaway, ""seeing"" a murder in progress, drives a car through the streets of Manhattan, even though she's effectively blind, screaming ""Donald!"" before finally crashing through a show window (how did she manage all those turns? From memory?)

But unintentional camp does not hurt ""the Eyes of Laura Mars"" one bit--in fact, it just makes it all the more delicious.

Not sure why it's so pricey...I would say if you like Dunaway and late 70's disco/glam/horror, you should probably add this one to your collection.",1392681600,7,1482,5.370689655172414
20066,2,0767821610,"Looking at the list of the cast - an ""A"" list- I was looking forward to a great movie. I was very wrong!
Dunaway throughout the movie has one look: a catatonic look in her closeups, and after a few closeups of that, it gets to be tedious and repetitive. The unexpected ending is not satisfactory, and does not make sense, either.
The acting of Jones is not very believable- this was one of his early movies.
I guess those are some of the reasons why the movie did so poorly at the box office.
Oh, one redeeming factor for the movie: A great look at the fashions, streets and New York scenes of the 70's. THAT was fun to watch!",1389830400,2,626,4.181818181818182

Dunaway had just won an Oscar for Network (1976), and despite a supernatural element that is integral to the story, her performance here is also very good.  Directed by Irvin Kershner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Empire-Strikes-Back/dp/B000FQJAJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Empire Strikes Back</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Say-Never-Again/dp/B00004WEJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Say Never Again</a>), the film also features Rene Auberjonois, Raul Julia, Brad Dourif, and Tommy Lee Jones.

Laura Mars is a photographer with a unique style, as her work often features attractive models in provocatively violent or edgy situations.  Unfortunately, someone has been murdering people, and then arranging the dead body or bodies, to resemble photos published in her book, The Eyes of Laura Mars.  Police Lt. John Neville (Jones) is already working the case, when people who are connected to Mars begin to turn up dead, killed by being stabbed in the eye.  In a strange psychic twist, Mars is apparently able to see the murders through the killer's eyes.

Mars and her manager her manager Donald Phelps (Auberjonois), attempt to continue with projects and photo shoots as usual, but the strange visions continue.  Neville begins to take a personal interest, as several models who work for Mars, become victims.  The situation is complicated by the unexpected appearance of Mars' ex-husband Michael Reisler (Julia), and the strange behavior of Mars' chauffer Tommy (Dourif).

The film prominently features New York City, providing a look at the ultra chic world of high fashion, the excess and decadence of affluence, contrasted with the dirty and gritty aspects of the city.

As usual, Dunaway is terrific, as her powerful performance helps to sell the odd premise of paranormal abilities.  Tommy Lee Jones doesn't seem like the ideal fit as a homicide detective, particularly when compared to every other cop in the film, but Rene Auberjonois and Brad Dourif are nicely cast for their roles.  Carpenter does a pretty good job of character development and dialog, which separates the film from a typical giallo.

A big budget affair with good production values, The Eyes of Laura Mars is an interesting watch, with some mildly scary moments.  It's similarities to a giallo are intriguing, but not everything works very well.  Neville sticks out like a sore thumb, the romance is forced and uncomfortable, and the supernatural element is never explained.  The ""twist"" ending which might have seemed fresh in 1978, seems like something of a clich now.

Barbara Streisand supposedly turned down the role of Laura Mars, but did provide some stunning, soul stirring vocals on the song ""Love theme from The Eyes of Laura Mars"".

20109,4,0767821610,"I saw this movie on American Movie Classics many years ago, not realizing how much was cut out of the film. No doubt the cuts hurt my initial impression of the movie. While I vaguely remembered the ending & overall plot, the details had long-since left my memory, so I re-viewed it (this time uncut) again a week or so ago. I'm glad that I did. It's stayed with me. This time I saw it & took in every detail. Other than Raul Julia, the film was basically very well-cast. That is no hit against the late Mr. Julia- he just wasn't the right fit for even the small part he had here.

The storyline of the film has been well-discussed already, but I'd like to add my own comments. I rarely review movies or music on Amazon because people tend to get so grouchy with me if my viewpoint differs from their own, and arguing with them isn't worth the hassle. But this movie is worth any heat I get in putting out my opinion on it. :D I was actually a little astounded by the level of nudity & violence portrayed artistically via photography in the film- and I believe that's the exact effect everyone making the movie was going for. Mission accomplished. I'm certainly no prude, having grown up on MTV, HBO & every other cable channel available since 1984. But nearly thirty-five years after it's release, even with all of the explosive films that I've sat through, this still has a jolting edge to it. I consider it a must-view film for others as it surprisingly produced an entirely new viewing experience for me. The psychic aspect portrayed is actually a little annoying to me & not really as important as it might be made out to be by the film's title. There's something of a ""guilty pleasure"" enjoyment in this film, which I thought only I felt, but others online confirmed they agreed on. I can't quite put my finger on it. I can say that the film is fast-paced; you won't be waiting around an hour to see any build-up of action here. It's pulsing from the first scene until the last, like good old-fashioned movies did so well. I don't see that much anymore with new films. Sigh.

Anyway...Faye Dunaway, who had gone from her softer blonde hair to a harsher (though then-popular) auburn by this time, didn't look or act her best here. Her performance was not called in by any means, but seems stiff in comparison to her earlier & somewhat warmer acting work. Opening her eyes widely seems to be her only available demonstration of fear- surprising, because she portrayed that emotion well in the film ""The Towering Inferno"", just a few years earlier. Her makeup artist for this film should've been fired- Dunaway looked drawn, exhausted & older than her real age even in scenes where she was not under any sort of duress. Still in great physical shape, Dunaway did a terrific job at portraying the very well-to-do & active star photographer that her character was in body, at least.

Tommy Lee Jones- uni-brow notwithstanding- was however at his utter peak here as a younger actor. I can say without a doubt that I'd be giving this film about two stars were it not for his work here. He managed to balance out the more esoteric elements of the movie with a refreshingly middle-class cop's outlook on things. His sweet sense of charm, earnestness, relaxed & gentle demeanor here was a good foil to the uptight Dunaway, and only he seemed to be able to bring out any real depth in Dunaway's character. The love story within this film is what sticks with me to be quite honest, and I give the appealing Jones the credit for that. He pulled off a performance in the midst of a difficult plot with admirable talent here. He had little time to develop a real bond to Dunaway's remote character in the film, and yet he pulled chemistry out of Dunaway which I don't know that another actor could have, given the ninety-miles-an-hour storyline. His scenes with the other actors of the film are also memorable- Jones' presence is probably what has left such a pleasant feeling in my mind, to be honest. He was endlessly watchable here. Frankly, I didn't have much of an opinion about him as an actor (other than knowing that he was quite talented) before viewing this, and certainly did not see him as a sex symbol. My opinion has now changed!

The film screams ""1978!"", but that's not a big deal. Frankly, it adds to the charm of the film. It has the similar cinematography feel to it as ""Saturday Night Fever"", which is actually quite appealing to me. There's a lot about this film I like that I can't quite put my finger on, despite the more chilling elements within it.

I also love the Barbra Streisand ""Love Theme..."" (written just for this movie) which was played at the beginning & end of the film- it sounds a great deal like her well-received & well-done album put out two years later, ""Guilty"". It adds to this little-known gem nicely. A recommended view if you don't mind some nudity & violence.",1344643200,2,4897,4.522573363431151

It's basically an interesting take on a murder thriller and for that time it seemed really cool, I remember watching it years ago thinking it was kind of ""freaky"" but now it's quite dated.

20163,3,0767821610,"The Eyes of Laura Mars, 1978 film

The story begins with someone looking at a book of pictures, then cutting one out. Then a woman is attacked with a knife. Later another woman gets out of bed and looks at a book of pictures. She makes a phone call, but gets no answer. Is photography just a hype for advertising? [Yes, and records facts and fictions.] Are provocative photographs a form of art? [Yes.] One man doesn't like these pictures. Someone has been murdered, she was the editor of Laura Mars' photobook. The next day the models are prepared for a photo shoot. Laura uses a Polaroid camera for test shots outdoors, Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Sex and Violence! Then Laura has a vision, or dizziness. Did she have breakfast? We see street traffic in New York City. Then Laura has another vision. The police detective questions her.

The models and help are in the police station while Laura is questioned. Laura takes pictures of reality, as defined by her camera. Some of Laura's art photos resemble crime scene pictures, and the police are interested. The police find a man's clothes in the murdered woman's closet. They belong to her ex-husband Michael Reisler. He is a writer who has returned from San Francisco. On location Laura has another vision! [Or a hallucination?] We see models being prepared for photography (you just don't push a button). Laura has another vision! [Is she overworked?] Lt. John Neville interviews two models of Laura Mars. [Pill-popping airheads?] While developing pictures she has another vision about those two models, Michelle & Lulu. She goes to their funerals. News photographers show up for ""human interest"". Lt. Neville gets closer to Laura. John offers a revolver to Laura for her protection. At a birthday party Laura gets a phone call from Michael, and uses a double to escape police surveillance. A mistake?

Lt. Neville gets a call about a suspect. The police search the apartment of Laura's employee. He tells what he saw in the basement. ""He pulled a knife on me!"" There is a chase and a shooting. Tommy won't talk. Its over. Lt. Neville visits Laura. But Laura has another vision! There is pounding on her door! Should ""death"" be used to sell things? [Life insurance?] Lt. Neville explains why Tommy acted that way. His talk alarms Laura! She runs to her bedroom and gets her revolver. There is a tense moment. ""If you love me, please kill me!"" There is a shot and a body falls to the floor. Next a phone call to report a death. The caller provides a name. [The ending reminds me of ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"".]

The photographs were taken by Helmut Newton, a fashion photographer whose work featured sex and violence to grab eyeballs. [Whatever happened to him?] This could be a better movie with a better story, it falls down in the end. It seems to be a lower-budget movie, created from a short story whose adaption to a movie reveals its flaws. One value of this movie is its expose of the way shocking photographs are used for advertising in some style magazines. Around this time they published a book with the photographs of ""Weegee"", a news photographer from the 1930s-1950s famous for his pictures of murder victims on the sidewalks of New York. Sexy photographs grab eyeballs like titillating gossip grabs ears. ""Did you hear about ...?""",1319068800,,3305,4.762652705061082

It was when photography was real and no photoshop around, yeah there were airbrushes, but talent and marketing made a celebrity, not just marketing.  It is one of Tommy Lee Jones' first major roles and he was great.  It was one of Faye Dunaway's last great roles.  People forget the director was Irvin Kershener who recently died and was known for Empire Strikes Back, and EOLM never was mentioned but was a better film, which was made before Empire.  The song by Barbara Streisand still is haunting and great today.  One reason it wasn't as well received was due to the producer being Jon Peters who was back then known more for being Barbara's Boyfriend.  But the script was written by John Carpenter who later made HALLOWEEN.  This movie's pedigree is more amazing since this was done before these other pieces, but it holds up and was worth the price.

Every scene is dynamic cinematically and the title sequence is just great. By the way, the song sung by the incomparable Barbra Streisand, was originally supposed to be a part of ""A Star Is Born"" but it was cut.

20215,3,0767821610,"Faye Dunaway is the title character Laura Mars.  Cutting edge fashion photographer of the avant garde, of questionable taste (her forte is sexualized violence), Laura suddenly experiences a vision one night: she wakes up unable to see what is in front of her ... instead she can see through the eyes of a murderer as he kills an associate.  Things quickly spiral out of control as the visions occur more frequently, and her friends are dispersed in the process.  In comes the police, unbelieving of her visions, but none the less forced to protect as it looks as though the killer is ultimately aiming for her.

A taut, yet somehow not so unbelievable love story ensues between Laura and the cop who is to protect her played by a young Tommy Lee Jones (a man always to be involved in films where he is a position of legal authority: No Country for Old Men, The Fugitive, The Client ... you know the rest).  Red herrings abound to an ending that everyone might see coming.

This movie is more titillating (pun INTENDED) than suspenseful or shocking.  A 70s film for sure; as sexuality, nudity, partying, and the decadence of glamour and glitz abound in this film from beginning to end.

20218,3,0767821610,"Faye Dunaway is one of my favorite actresses.  She gives a good performance but is limited by a mediocre plot in this mediocre movie.  She is the Laura Mars of the title. Laura is a high fashion photographer who mixes sex with violence in her photography.  In 1978 it was a more controversial issue than it seems to be today. Its thin veneer serve as a token plot theme.

Out of nowhere Laura begins having psychic visions of murders of people she knows which turn out to be real; all committed by the same killer, through whose eyes she envisions the murders.  I say out of nowhere because there is no indication that she ever had psychic visions in her past.  It makes for a faulty plot non-sequitur, especially since she is obviously at least in her 30's when she begins to have these visions for the first time.

Produced by Jon Peters, one-time hair stylist and ex-husband of Barbra Streisand who sings the title song, the story is long on glitz and short on thrills or chills.  There are plenty of topless models getting dressed and some very attractive young women added to cover a very thin plot.

A young Tommy Lee Jones plays detective John Neville who is in charge of Laura's well-being while the killer is on the loose. He is still a few years and film experience away from developing the persona that has made him so popular today.  His performance is uneven at best and he seems to have real difficulties with the role. His performance in the final scene must make him cringe today.

Rene Auberjonois gives the best supporting performance as Laura's agent/promoter.  Raul Julia is credible as her ex-husband but does not have the chance with such a small role to show the potential that would lead to his brilliant performance in ""The Kiss of the Spider Woman"" in 1985.

However, I love the premise of ""Eyes of Laura Mars"".  Faye Dunaway plays a stressed-out, highly successful fashion photographer who starts seeing the commission of violent murders through the eyes of a particularly vicious killer. When he starts targeting her friends, Laura Mars suddenly realizes that she's also on the killer's list, and probably the one person who can stop him/her.  It's an Americanized version of the Italian giallo genre, and it almost works.  Faye Dunaway is wonderfully neurotic as the glamorous, high-strung Laura Mars; she has a world-weary beauty and pent-up energy that fairly snaps when she's onscreen (which is often; she's in almost every scene)--you can't take your eyes off her.  A young and ruggedly handsome Tommy Lee Jones is on hand as the key detective on the case, and a potential suitor for Laura.  Jones had a charisma even in ""Eyes of Laura Mars"", although I feel that, with his Texas accent and homely good looks, he's miscast as a veteran New York City police detective.  The rest of the cast does a credible job, particularly Brad Dourif, in another creepy role, this time as Laura's ex-con driver, and Rene Auberjonois, as her edgy, chain-smoking manager.  Raul Julia, also surprisingly young and fresh-looking, appears (mostly as male eye candy) as Laura's conniving ex-husband, and Darlanne Fluegel and Lisa Taylor are fun as two of Laura's models, and potential victims for the killer.

The cinematography is sufficiently flashy to convey the decadence of the world inhabited by Laura Mars and her crowd.  However, the muted, autumnal colors of Laura's wardrobe seem to be at variance with this world--she should have chic, brightly colored clothing, not the dreadful, ill-fitting costumes that were apparently designed by Theoni Aldredge for this movie.

Although well-directed by Irvin Kirschner, a screenplay partially penned by John Carpenter, and a song performed by Barbra Streisand (producer Jon Peters was her boyfriend at the time), ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" ultimately falls on its face by the time it reaches it's contrived and predictable  ending.

20278,5,0767821610,"I absolutely LOVE this movie, and I am also a fan of Faye Dunaway, who played the title character in this film. Her character (Laura Mars) is a fashion freelance photographer who has a ""psychic"" ability to see murders taking place from her mind even though she is never at those happenings in person, and whose photographic work is controversial. Tommy Lee Jones, who played Laura's police bodyguard (John Neville), was great as well. It is really shocking to also see a slight trace of nudity in it. Well, it's not considered a pornographic movie because there is not enough nudity in it. It's really amazing to see Faye using a camera in this movie (that's why her character is a photographer). This DVD is excellent. When you put this into your DVD player, you have the option of watching the movie in either widescreen or full screen (I prefer widescreen mostly; but then again, it doesn't hurt to see it in full screen once in a while). You also have the option of seeing the movie with Irvin Kershner's directorial commentary. He did a great job on his commentary, because it's almost like you're watching the movie with him. There is also a featurette called ""Visions"", which describes the making of the movie. And, there is also a photo gallery (with interesting photos) with the DVD producer describing how some of the things differ from the script and the finalized movie. Barbra Streisand had declined to play the title character in this movie, but did agree to sing the title theme from the movie, ""Prisoner"". Even though Barbra declined to star in the film, I strongly believe that she did a great job singing the ""Prisoner"" theme. The other music heard in the film is wonderful as well, with some well known disco grooves and some incidental instrumental music.

The story spins around the controversially provocative  high-fashion photographs shot by  the infamous Laura Mars ( Dunaway looking as hot as the models) and her  murderous preminitions.  Casting  the actual vogue models (and hair and makeup people) who actually participated  in those racy fashion photos at that time  makes it  wonderfully authentic. A  sensational  thriller  that captures that spirit of wild erotic abandon which the high fashion world was totally lost in at that time .  To witness the  outrageous photo-shoot sequences , gorgeous half naked  lingerie-clad models  cat -fighting  in front of  burning cars, models in evening glamour posing with pistols and dead male models-  is worth it alone.

It masquerades as a slasher film (John Carpenter has a writing credit), but it's really a very sharp parable about the Artist in Society.  Everything around her gets sacrificed as art-photographer Laura Mars (played by Faye Dunaway) pursues her inexorable visions; she's embattled against a hostile, uncomprehending public and her own self-doubts.  The fact that she's a strong, independent woman is significant too, because she ends up realizing that she is still just a victim-tool of the patriarchy whose sign-system she has tried to hijack for her violent images.  The twist ending redefines ""tough love"" at its toughest, as Laura finally realizes that she can't hope to transcend the world but must sink down to its lowest level in order to survive.  And if all this sounds too highfalutin, well, this is also delicious camp, a delirious 70's time capsule, from the Streisand rock song to the coolly robotic disco strains, to the hugely mascara'ed, shag-cut models, to the outre photographs courtesy of Helmut Newton.  This would make an excellent 70's-nostalgia double bill with ""Can't Stop the Music,"" the Village People's immortal epic.  And I should add that Faye Dunaway is at her most mesmerizing in this role, conveying with her intense eyes alone all the terror and sorrow and frustration of Laura Mars.  With censorship once again on the rise in America, and subversive art still the perennial target of ""moralistic"" backlash, don't say that the premise of this film couldn't really happen!",1108339200,5,1574,5.097276264591439

Combining the improbable worlds of violence and fashion, with a story that centers on a famous photographer (Dunaway) and her ability to *see* her friends and colleagues being stalked and murdered, *Eyes* has moments of serious suspense, but that's hardly the reason to see this movie. Utilizing the actual photography of fashion god Helmut Newton, the film maker has exquisitely captured the 1978 New York fashion and disco scene in a way that none of the recent looks at the Seventies has been able to, but then, again, this movie was *made* in 1978, not 20 years later. The scenes of photo shoots are particularly fun to watch, with one scene portraying a burning car crash in Columbus Circle in which the models, clad in garter belts and fur coats get in a cat fight before the camera. The ingenuous use of *real* models add the precise amount of vacuity necessary to make the surreal shot work. Another photo shoot involves a model dead from a gunshot to his heart lying in a pool surrounded by exotically dressed disco-dancing models and a throbbing disco beat. The plot is secondary to style in this movie, and style is the only reason this movie should be remembered. Favorite moment: Darlanne Fluegel as the model Lulu haplessly trying to explain to the press *why* violence is important in fashion photos.",1106352000,2,1829,4.970588235294118
20302,4,0767821610,"""Eyes of Laura Mars"" may be a flawed picture to some degree, but it's a great semi-kinky period piece [only ""semi"" by today's standards], the actors are good and paranoid and appropriately overwrought, and there is an atmosphere that holds this well-directed/well-edited film together.

The only faults are a couple minor quirks in the script-- like you can tell whodunit almost right away.

Irvin Kirschner, the very intelligent director who guided this (as well as ""Empire Strikes Back"", etc..), provides a non-stop commentary track which is interesting.

My main complaint with the DVD: as a double-sided disc, you have the option of watching it on the square ""full screen"" shaped for TV, or the ALLEGED widescreen--- but the widescreen here is actually the square TV-version only with the 'heads and feet' cut-off in letterbox style... In other words, you're not only missing the SIDES of the picture [as you do in a standard square TV print, of course] but they've lopped off the top and bottom to create a pseudo-widescreen version, which means you're missing a major part of the picture from ALL FOUR SIDES! (As a result, the standard, square TV version has more visual data.... but neither side of the disc gives you the actual original widescreen theatre version.)",1096243200,55,1273,5.023696682464455
20303,5,0767821610,"I can remember when ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" came out back in 1978. The movie trailer shows that fantastic scene when Tommy Lee Jones comes right through that huge glass window. They would show this over and over on TV back then, when advertising this movie. For some reason, I knew who Tommy Lee Jones was back then. And I didn't watch the soap opera he was on either. Goes to show you what STAR POWER he had then. So cute with that great bowlish haircut!!!
Twenty Five years later, this movie still holds up!! I hadn't seen it in so long, we used to have a black & white television, this is how long i have seen it.
But i purchased the DVD last night, and watched it about 3 times. Seeing it in color is a real treat, and there are actors that i now recognize that i didn't back then.
Raul Julia as the Ex husband Michael Reisler has the line of the decade when he says to Faye Dunaway ""I was your husband, I was never your friend!""......
Brad Dourif as Tommy Ludlow is wonderful as the loyal but suspicious looking chauffeuer/go-for. As Irvin Kershner states in his commentary ""look at this guy, he's in the inner circle, and he's sloppily dressed, and his hair's a mess...""
I love Rene Auberjonois in this film. At this time, during the mid-late 1970's you could find Rene in just about every TV show, made for TV movie and film. This guy must never have been home!!!
Lisa Taylor at the time was about one of the most beautiful models in the early to later 1970's. I remember Darlanne Fleugel well (she was also in Crime Story in the late 1980s)but had never really connected her face with her name until now. Also you will see a young John Sahag, he plays a hairdresser in the movie. In real life he is one of the top hair stylists today, and is still cute with that shaggy hair and tight shirts!! He really hasn't changed!!!! It's these types of things that i like about the movie. The fashion, the music, the accessories, and even the wonderful STEIFF bear that is in the police precinct. He is sitting on the large table where Tommy Lee Jones conducts his investigations. You can see Lisa Taylor hugging the bear in another scene, and she doesn't want to let go.
Neither would I, for that matter!!!
But the film is great, and is a must see for those who enjoyed the films of the 1970's. Also invaluable is a nice ""Eyes on Laura"" photo gallery, where a person by the name of Laurent, gives us an inside to the script's changes while they show some great photos. Then the Director's Commentary is wonderful~~~Irvin Kershner talks to you, not AT YOU, just as if you were sitting with him in a living room, relaxing, and he gives you a play by play on the whole movie!!! He seems to be a person you can relate to, and his generous information will really brighten your day!",1076025600,11,2773,4.334615384615384
20304,5,0767821610,"Only in the seventies could a glossy, overblown film like this be so good.  And it is..in spite of its excesses.  Faye Dunaway, fresh from her Oscar turn in NETWORK, plays Laura Mars, a fashion photographer specializing in grotesque murder images.  She also can ""see"" the murderer of several of her models while he or she is committing the foul deeds.  Conveniently, the script doesn't address just how Laura got this ""psychic ability.""  But it doesn't matter as it makes a  compelling device when she joins the murderer via satellite.  Rene Auberjenois chews up the scenery as her manager/agent, whose foppishness and over the top emoting are delightful to watch.  Tommy Lee Jones, in one of his first big-screen features, plays the dashing detective John Neville, who falls in love with Dunaway and tries to believe her psychic witnessing.  Director Irving Kershner keeps the glamour and glitz going with some deft mood swings.  He gets good performances from his whole cast, although at times Faye seems to be auditioning for her later role in ""Mommie Dearest,"" but she pulls back enough to keep her performance interesting.  Jones is smooth, although his youth hinders some major transformations in the film.  And definitely the costume designer had her work cut out for her with all of the fashions Dunaway wears.  But it's the glitzy seventies and the mystery holds your attention, so that Laura Mars emerges as a gripping and entertaining whodunit.  Also, it has the stunning ""Prisoner"" sung by producer Jon Peters' main squeeze then, Barbra Streisand.",1070496000,2,1559,5.0390625

I loved this era: NYC was at it chicest,, sexiest, grimiest best.  The sets/locations alone make this worth watching.  Laura's pier studio, c'mon, awesome.  The clothes were so fabulous for the era, the music... Lets All Chant, man!.  Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif, Raul Julia - c'mon!  How awesome can you get.

20307,4,0767821610,"This was the movie that made me want to move to New York (hey, I was in grade school at the time).  Perfectly capturing the look of glam '70's in a way that other, more famous 70's movies didn't, this thriller delivers some real scares.  Faye Dunaway is actually pretty good as the beleagured Laura Mars.  She overacts in a few scenes, but for the most part isn't bad at all. Tommy Lee Jones is great as the detective that falls for her, and the supporting cast, while a little cardboard, aren't too bad (except for the dead model's boyfriend at the funeral- while the cops wrestle him to the ground, he practically yodels his line ""you're gonnnnaaa paaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy!"" while Faye dives into the limo to avoid the paparazzi), and the look of the movie; the clothes, the sets, all have a dark, glossy richness that remind us that ""Saturday Night Fever"" was not the way everybody dressed back then.  The quality of the DVD is not great, and there is no stereo, but it's a well-priced disc, and a pretty fun movie.  I wish they'd re-relase the soundtrack to it.",1023235200,5,1064,4.549738219895288
20308,2,0767821610,"I remember seeing ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" in the theater lo' these many years ago and while not a life-changing motion picture it has remained, since then, utterly watcheable. I confess I have sat through at least twice since it has been on TV - a sign I need to either get out or that on some cheesy level of my onw, I enjoy it.
I must agree with much Bragan Thomas' articulate review but beg to differ on his claims that the movie makes no sense - and the specific examples he uses to support this claim.  True, the plot is thin and the resolution thinner still...but the movie does have a story to tell and tries to do so.
To answer Mr. Thomas' question ""Why does the killer enter Mars' mind (presumably in the first place)?  It's simple really - her photos.  Early on we see examples of Mars' trendy, society-is-sick and dangerous fashion photographs.  The killer's childhood mirrors the crime scene photos (and Mars') that he has access to.  Connection made.
Why doesn't Laura warn her soon to be killed friends?  It's always too late.  She see what the killer sees as the killer is about to strike.
So - while cheesy yes - ""Laura Mars"" does, for the most part, make sense.",1015200000,4,1179,4.405529953917051
20309,5,0767821610,"Okay, you want a cheesed out supernatural thriller?  This is it!  And amazingly enough, it gets royal treatment on DVD without any of the VHS edits, a very clear picture, director's commentary, and even a commentary over the photo gallery that is just as informative.  The movie itself is a great social commentary on New York and advertising in the late 70s.  It's a little predictable, but completely entertaining.",1011052800,4,416,4.9855072463768115
20310,5,0767821610,"I was surprised at how good this film was and how creepy it was in parts. Faye Dunaway gives a fairly polished performance as the renowned but fragile photographer Laura Mars who has the uncanny ability to recreate (using live models) violent crime scenes that have taken already place. This ability does not escape the attention of a local police officer, John Neville played by Tommy Lee Jones in an early acting role. The relationship between John and Laura is both tender and brittle. Both are damaged people with secrets to hide and both fear exposure of the truth behind Laura's gift of second-sight. There is a good cast, such as Rene Auberjonois and Brad Dourif but they have minor roles, these were days before Deep Space Nine and Star Trek - Voyager. A spooky, thoughtful little movie with good camera work, vivid splashes of color and a funky 1970s sound track to accompany it. There's also a neat twist at the end of the film that took me by surprise but I won't spoil it for everyone by revealing it in this review!",1005609600,27,1028,4.592391304347826
20311,4,0767821610,"I was a bit surprised to read such good reviews of what is at best an  enjoyable, albeit nonsensical thriller.  Faye Dunaway overacts shamelessly  in the title role, giving more than a hint of the crazed performance she  would deliver only two years later in Mommie Dearest: She's all top-volume  ululations and pop-eyed grimaces (decibel levels become unbearable when she  runs through the streets screaming ""Donald!  Donald!"" late in the  film).  Tommy Lee Jones is hulking and bearish as the cop who falls in love  with Laura, and Rene Auberjonois is especially chic as Laura's best friend  (brutally dispatched in one of the pic's most gratuitous sequences).  The  entire plot basically makes no sense at all (who knows why she sees the  murders or how the killer gets into her mind, and why doesn't she warn the  future victims?), and the film's alleged critique of ""S&M  Chic"" is pop-psychology laughable. However, the movie as a whole is  great if you want a little late 1970's nostalgia - the sleek, glitzy,  Studio 54-milieu of New York's fashionistas is beautifully depicted without  even a hint of irony: Dunaway and Auberjonois' clothes are stunning (not  every article of 70's clothing was all polyester!) and the bizarre  Streisand-disco sountrack is deliciousy sleazy.  All-in-all, this film is  an enjoyable, if trashy, glitterfest for those who wish they could have  lived the high life of the 1970's.
