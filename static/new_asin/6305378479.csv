7888421,4,6305378479,"My WCW fix continues as here's another PPV I found in an old box.  WCW around this time was going through a lot of changes as far as booking & just the overall direction of the company (including a new logo).  Despite being the leader of the nWo, Hollywood Hogan was slowly starting to become a babyface again while Ric Flair (who was WCW President at that time) was starting to turn heel, WCW also started an unofficial hardcore division featuring old faces from ECW like Hak (Sandman) & Bam Bam Bigelow, the nWo was slowly beginning to fade away, and were starting to pay more attention to the booking of the undercard more than just putting guys out there & hotshotting angles to have matches.

Juventud Guerrera vs. Blitzkrieg - For those who don't know or can't remember, Blitzkrieg was a masked crusierweight that was around WCW for a short time in 1999 (had an impressive match with Mysterio that made it onto his DVD set) and if he stayed in the business had the potention of being the second coming of Rey Mysterio as this wrestler was incredibly quick.  Him & Juventud gave one of the most underrated opening matches in the companies history as the match looked like someone pressed the fast foward button as this was just (no pun intended) total nonstop action with sick spots.

Hardcore Match: Hak vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Again, for those who can't remember...Hak was the WCW name for ECW's Sandman.  This was a hardcore weapons/spot fest as this used ""everything but the kitchen sink"" here.  A salad bowl, trash cans, tables, mops, ladders, a safety rail, and Hak even doing a sommersault off the stagecoach on the entrance way.  Bigelow got the win & kept the unofficial title of ""King Of Hardcore"" with the Greetings From Asbury Park off the top rope through a table.

Scotty Riggs vs. Mikey Whipwreck - Just a boring filler, skip it.

Konnan vs. Disco Inferno - It was watchable but nothing past that.

WCW Crusierweight Champion Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Billy Kidman - Once again for those who don't remember, this was around the time that Mysterio was unmasked (which according to WWE never happened but that's another story).  Unlike the previous crusierweight match, this was less of a spotfest and more of a mixture of high flyin' along with good wrestling.  If this wasn't during the period where Mysterio was without his mask, this match would get more credit than it deserves.

Raven & Saturn vs. Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko - Three of the future ""radicalz"" & another wrestler who jumped ship 4 months earlier before they could delivered quite the tag team match here with a great mix of wrestling along with the ""Raven's Rules"" coming into play at times with a chair getting involved.  These men did what they did best & deliver a damn good match.

WCW United States Championship Match: Booker T vs. Scott Steiner - This was the tournament final for the vacant U.S. Championship (which was last held by Scott Hall) & also a rematch from their Television Championship match last month.  Overall, it was a nice but not outstanding back & forth match but the moments before it heavily showcased why Scott Steiner was a heat magnet in WCW during that time.

Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash - This was really just there for Goldberg to get his win back from Kevin Nash & nothing special past that fact as this didn't come close to their previous Starrcade encounter.

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Diamond Dallas Page vs. Hollywood Hogan vs. Sting with Randy Savage as Special Guest Referee - This match marked the return of Sting since last October & Randy Savage's return (minus a cameo appearence last Dec.) since July of last year.  This was a four way dance where the first one to get the pin/submission would become the WCW Champion.  It ended up turning into a 3 way dance when DDP injured Hogan's leg which lead to Eric Bischoff (the first time you saw him in weeks) coming out to help Hogan back.  The match was fun to watch between all three men with Randy Savage playing his card in dropping the elbow on Ric Flair helping DDP finally win the WCW Championship.

In the end, there were a few minor flops but those matches didn't last long & the wrestling quality here here weather your a fan of technical wrestling, hardcore wrestling, or high flyin' crusierweight action.  In the end, this is a quality WCW PPV that I would recommend checking out.",1219449600,,4361,4.619170984455959
7888422,5,6305378479,"I miss WCW.
The final fourway looks great. Hogan not winning makes this ppv an automatic 3 stars. Hack and BamBam destroying each other is a bonus that gives the other two.",1076716800,,172,4.40625
7888423,4,6305378479,"Finally DDP is given the strap, but what makes this PPV so great is that Hogan was originally booked to win, (go figure) and he couldn't take the pace of DDP (45) Sting (alright he ruled wcw) and Flair (52) and gets injured midway through the match, leaving DDP to get the belt on the fly, its a true classic for this match only the rest is the typical WCW ppv which usually rivals Thunder in excitement.  Hack  and Bigealo is alright too.",1009152000,,439,4.27710843373494
7888424,4,6305378479,May be the best p.p.v ever. The best match was Hack vs. Bam Bam Bigelo in a no rules match. And the fatel fourway match. You want to get this movie.,1003017600,,148,3.806451612903226
