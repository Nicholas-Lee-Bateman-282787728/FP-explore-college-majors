173798,5,0972043306,"What is so refreshing about this material is that it does not push a religious or ""Creationist"" front, as so many that strives to contradict Evolution do. Rather than approaching the debate with advocates for Creationism, it approaches the debate with advocates for Evolution (and most of them staunch evolutionists) who are willing to admit that there are some holes.
This VHS does not provide any answers. Rather, it begs creative and critical thought, a needed quality in today's world of gloss and mind-numbing entertainment. The piece stays true to the ""scientific method"" of questioning and testing rather than simple avocation of a theory. Rather than accepting inconsistencies, this piece simply asking the participant to execute logical scientific process and look at all options. It acknowledges the fact that Evolution still does not explain everything, nor does it provide a 100% solid foundation as a guiding principal for the explanation of life on this earth. It begs the viewer to look, as a true scientist would, at all current theories and to begin the critical thinking process again from a new viewpoint of objectivity rather than political fence-straddling.
There is real content here so the producers resisted the urge (as so many today do NOT) to gloss over everything with audio/video eye-candy. This is a logical film that is infinitely accessible and informative. Format, flow, and images are clear and straight forward, with impressive computer graphics and appropriate audio tracks strive to do more than giving me an ""experience"". I won't be showing this to friends for the great graphics or the smooth soundtrack - I will share it with them for discussion.
I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is fascinated by the questions of who are we, where are from, and where are we going. I would also recommend this to any school curriculum program, especially high school science - I can't help but wonder how much further we could have learned the principles of science, debate, and presentation, if we would have simply viewed this when I was in high school. It begs the point of fostering open discussion and personal questioning.
Given this aspect, it would also be highly appropriate to any university as well, this primarily because it simply asks us to open our eyes to all possibilities rather than blindly following an ""ism"". This video has no ""camp"" and does not pretend to accept anything other than inquiry.
I have always personally believed that the educational process was to make creative thinkers rather than automated encyclopedias of information - this video treats me like a thinker rather than a sheep - a nice change.
Whenever I find myself or my family simply accepting anything that doesn't really make sence, this film will be spinning in the video player as a wake-up call. I want my children to be leaders, not followers.",1055116800,8,2883,5.020876826722338

173800,5,0972043306,"""Icons of Evolution"" should be required viewing for all high school science teachers and parents of high school students. In fact, it would probably be a good thing for high school students to watch the video themselves. The story is compelling, but the issues raised are even more important than the story itself.
As a former public high school biology teacher, I'm impressed by how plainly this video lays out some of the fundamental problems with public high school science education. On the one hand, doctrinaire pressure groups like the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), who seem to have only one agenda item, work to impose their particular version of evolution on all students. On the other hand you have weak-kneed bureaucratic administrators who haven't a clue about what it being taught but simply ""follow the curriculum as it is given.""
In this environment, all innovation is stomped out and students end up with a dry recitations of lessons which contain rubbish mixed in with important information. When I taught using Miller and Levine, the most popular high school biology text at the time, it contained garbage like drawings of embryos by Ernst Haeckel which were recognized as nonsense over 100 years ago. What shocks me is that I seemed to be the only teacher who knew this was garbage. ""Icons of Evolution"" should be a wakeup call to all taxpayers who continue to flush money uncritically into our public education system.
The potential for something much better than we have is out there. Buy this video, watch it, get informed, get out there and demand change.",1054425600,36,1593,4.9700374531835205
173801,5,0972043306,"Based on the controversial book by biologist Jonathan Wells, this fascinating documentary explores recent claims that many standard textbook evidences offered for Darwinian evolution (the ""icons of evolution"") are actually misleading if not false. The video also interweaves the story of a high school biology teacher who faces stiff resistance for trying to tell his students about some of the scientific controversies over Darwin's theory. This documentary is notable for featuring interviews with BOTH critics and defenders of Darwin's theory. Critics featured include Jonathan Wells and the wry and witty David Berlinski, while defenders of Darwin who show up include Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education and Ken Miller, author of Finding Darwin's God. Particularly intriguing is the segment on the ""Cambrian Explosion"" some 500 million years ago, which features exclusive footage from major fossil beds in China and includes interviews with Chinese paleontologists who say their findings are turning Darwin's tree of life upside down. If you are interested in the scientific (as opposed to religious) questions being raised about evolution, this is perhaps the single best introduction. Anyone who thinks that there is no scientific controversy over evolution should watch this documentary. Whatever your view on evolution, this video is likely to be an eye-opening experience. Highly recommended for high school age and above. It's interesting that several of the reviews on this page that claim to pan the video have not even watched it, for they talk about things that aren't even covered in the video. For example, the video is not about either intelligent design or creationism. Nor does it deal with the peppered moth issue (although peppered moths are a prominent part of the BOOK Icons of Evolution). Nor does it attack the scientific method. I guess some Darwinists are so sure of the truth that they are willing to attack something that they haven't even seen. What a curious conception of science!",1054339200,17,2035,5.342679127725857

173808,1,0972043306,"I received this DVD as a gift from a religious friend (rather than buying it from Amazon) and after watching through the ENTIRE painstaking ordeal, have come to the inevitable, irresistible conclusion that Dr. Wells is a liar through and through. EVERY SINGLE quote he uses from other scientists is taken out of context or has important details left out.

Many of the people he quotes (Wells has done no actual research of his own, of course. He'd much rather brainwash his students than actually try to find the truth or falsity of his own statements.) have written rebuttals demonstrating his manipulations or outright lies.

Dr Bruce Grant, Professor of Biology at College of William and Mary (quoted by Wells) stated, and I quote: ""To one outside the field, he passes as a scholar, complete with Ph. D. Unfortunately, Dr Wells is intellectually dishonest. . . . He lavishly dresses his essays in quotations from experts (including some from me) which are generally taken out of context, and he systematically omits relevant details to make our conclusions seem ill founded, flawed, or fraudulent.""

Those who've given this a positive review are suffering from the same anti-scientific, anti-evolution, pro-creationist bias as Wells. You can see this easily by the other products that were frequently bought with Icons. While Icons at least attempts to APPEAR unbiased (it isn't. I've stated its bias already) the others are CLEARLY pro-creationism. Wells knows that those who believe in god don't want to read; most treat the bible like a software license - they just skip to the bottom and click ""I agree"" without knowing what any of it says. <On average, Atheists and Agnostics tend to know more about religions than the adherents and believers of those religions.  He also knows that the faithful won't know enough about evolution to see the gaps in his arguments, and that they won't do any research to see that he's lying through his teeth. So of course confirmation bias kicks in and they see Icons as backing up what they already 'know' (actually: believe without evidence. the bible is a set of claims, not a set of evidence, much less proof. those who read the bible using rational, intelligent thought instead of cherry-picking the feel-good parts about love and peace tend to doubt their faith or reject it altogether.)

I am indebted to this person for inevitably arousing my curiosity to the point where I just had to see for myself what it could be that was perceived as being so deserving of this sort of attempt at censorship. Having now viewed the DVD, its plain to see why individuals who are committed to and thereby constrained by Neo-Darwinian theory are so keen to supress compelling evidence against it. I have in fact read Jonathan Wells book with the same title as the DVD and while the video presentation understandably lacks the detail of the book, it is an excellent resume of information which, in my view, needs to become more widely circulated.  If what the Intelligent Design fraternity are saying doesnt stand the test of time it will die a natural death i.e. it will be eliminated by natural selection. If they are right then, as David Berlinsky says during the presentation, nothing bad will happen. A faulty theory may have to be seriously modified or even discarded and replaced but that's not a bad thing in fact it is a necessary thing and it wouldn't be the first time its occurred. Full marks to the Intelligent Design guys for their measured, reasonable, quietly confident, no-nonsense, convincing, scientifically sound and religiously neutral approach to their subject.

Add to it a 1994 hoax  -  a chirality experiment(see below*) described in
""Underhanded 'Breakthrough' Revealed"",  Science, July 1, 1994

In layman's terms, at the molecular level, the chemical processes in nature create amino acids that are unreliable, switching for one form to a harmful form.  Harmful, because such amino acid would form malformed proteins and enzymes in fatal amounts.  Biological systems had to ""evolve"" a complex chemical machinery to deal with unreliable molecular forms that switch on the poor creature.  Very improbable. A hoax involving a theory on powerful magnetic fields was foisted on the science community to explain away the problem but companies had them repeat the experiments. A scientist was spiking the solution.

If you tell me: ""Probably, there was a transitional mechanism, we will find it"", there is no promising finding or theory on that yet, only conjecture. Using the word ""probably"", you have entered the realm of faith, hope and religion.

173825,4,0972043306,"The video uses the case of high school biology teacher Roger DeHart to introduce and frame a presentation on six of the ""icons of evolution"": Haeckel's embryos, Darwin's finches, four-winged fruit flies, homology in vertebrate limbs, bacterial resistance to antibiotics, and Darwin's ""Tree of Life"". These are referred to as ""icons"" because they are presented in biology texts as key proofs that Darwinian evolution has occurred. However, each of these is at best misleading (four-winged fruit flies) and at worst an outright fake (Haeckel's embryo drawings). Mr. DeHart was a popular teacher who had taught high school biology for many years. He supplemented the standard textbook presentation of the theory of evolution with additional materials from mainstream , peer-reviewed scientific publications illustrating that there was some disagreement in the scientific community over the interpretation of the purported evidence for evolution. This practice was challenged in the late 1990s (even though teachers in other disciplines frequently used supplementary materials without any challenges) and led to public debate over how the theory of evolution should be taught.

I thoroughly enjoyed both the video and the book and highly recommend it to everyone. The film is done in the spirit of not shutting out information we don't agree with but keeping our minds open and fully examining all the evidence, pro and con.

For all who think that Darwin's theory is only explanation of life origins (like Richard Dawkins who consider only his own opinion) this DVD would be disturbing.
The movie is a good illustration of many spurious facts made in support of Darwin's theory of evolution like HAECKEL drawings [...]. Also the observation of finches at Galpagos Islands does not give a solid evidence to support the evolution theory because the size and shape of their beaks of this species changes back and forward adapting to environment. Again the Cambrian explosion is the rapid appearance of most major groups of complex animals around 530 million years ago, as evidenced by the fossil record. If some  like soft body's organisms could be preserved then should be found the fossils of transitions of animal forms which is not in the fossil records.
It's a good film which does not represent a religions or Darwinist followers. It gives you a base for thinking and questioning of Darwin theory.

173833,4,0972043306,"ICONS OF EVOLUTION is a fascinating film which presents hard questions and troublesome evidence against the popular theory of evolution.  Before judging the merits of the film, it is important to accurately understand the film's topic of criticism, which is the Neo-Darwinism.  Neo-Darwinism is the theory that natural forces 'select' for organisms possessing certain phenotypic variations over others.  Phenotypic variations are those that are `apparent-' for example, the neck length of giraffes.  Therefore, Giraffes with longer necks are selected over those with shorter necks in an area with tall trees.  Phenotypic variations arise from genotypic variations (variations in genes) caused by random mutations in the genetic code.  (In this case, some giraffes have longer necks than others due to differences in their genes coding for neck length).  Increased survival of an organism (or a group of organisms) as a result of selection by natural forces ultimately results in increased numbers of alleles coding for the 'selected' phenotype.  Using the giraffe example, genes producing giraffes with longer necks are selected for,and will increase in number, in areas with tall trees, over genes producing giraffes with shorter necks.

The process above, which basically can be simplified to state that natural selection selects for certain random mutations in the genetic code, is used to explain important biological phenomena such as the tight adaptation of organisms to their environment, and the diversity of organisms present in the earth.

So that's Neo-Darwinism, the widely accepted theory that every biology student is taught, in a nutshell.  ICONS OF EVOLUTION, by examining persistent, recurrent themes of Neo-Darwinism, convincingly argues that Neo-Darwinism is based on poor scientific evidence, misleading claims, and flat-out fraud and lies.  Furthermore, it is propagated by a culture of heavy censure and intimidation.  Here are the film's arguments:

Neo-Darwinism is based on poor scientific evidence:

Neo-Darwinism by its very definition cannot account for the origin of life, for the theory assumes the existence of genetic material.  However, one cannot avoid the question of how life originated, so Neo-Darwinists explain the origins of life by noting that certain chemical reactions are favored by certain natural environments, and claiming that the primeval earth presented perfect natural conditions for life to evolve.  The paradigm case is the Miller-Urey experiments.  Miller and colleagues set up in the laboratory conditions supposedly similar to primeval earth, and found these conditions created amino acids and other organic molecules, the building blocks of life.  Unfortunately, Miller had assumed primeval earth was nearly oxygen free, a key contention that is rejected by many geologists today.  The presence of oxygen destabilizes organic molecules, making their creation and sustainability, (and thus life) much less likely.

Perhaps the most prominent Neo-Darwinist icon is the elegant evolutionary tree.  The tree lays out neatly how major species present today all evolved from common ancestors, often starting at the very beginning from a single cell, laying out multiple stages with transitional forms (such as the archaeopteryx) in between.  Unfortunately, scientific evidence challenges such neat evolutionary pathways.  For example, during the Cambrian Period an explosion of new life forms emerged which do not have ancestors in the fossil record.  Other than upsetting the neat tree, such sudden appearance of life in short periods of time poses problems for Neo-Darwinist theory which claims the slow transformation of organisms due to the accumulation of adaptive genetic mutations.

Neo-Darwinism is based on misleading claims:

A key evidence for Neo-Darwinism is the evolution of Galapagos Finches.  Supposedly different finch species evolved from a common ancestor when they were dispersed on different islands due to different food sources being present on different islands.  The main difference among these finches is their beaks, which adapted to their different diets.  Modern research, however, has found that Galapagos finch beaks change size and shape with the change of seasons!  So, in the dry seasons, the beaks get larger and when it is rainy, they often revert back.  The lack of permanence of these changes does not fit well with Neo-Darwinist theory.

Another misleading claim by Neo-Darwinists has to do with homologous structures.  It is claimed that the since the bone structures of the arms of humans, wings of birds, and the fins of whales are similar, this suggest common ancestry.  However, while the bone structures (phenotypes) are similar, the genes coding for them (genotypes) are completely different in different species.  Thus, it's not possible to infer common evolutionary pathways using a Neo-Darwinist mechanism using forelimb homology.

Neo-Darwinism is based on fraud and lies:

A vast majority of biology textbooks present as evidence of evolution drawings of embryos from different species.  The point is that since the uterine environment is supposedly similar among different species, there are few selective forces favoring differentiation.  Unfortunately, these drawings, originating from one Ernst Haeckel in the 19th century, are admitted fakes.  Real embryos of different species DO look quite different from each other.  Darwinists admit this, but many texts continue to present Haeckel's embryos as evidence for evolution.

Another example commonly found in biology texts are the famous English light and dark peppered moths.  The claim here is that before the industrial evolution, most peppered moths were light, and were able to blend well on trees with light trunks common in the British Isles. However, increased pollution resulted in trees being covered in soot.  Mutant dark moths were now better camouflaged on sooty barks, escaped predation, and increased in number.  Unfortunately, further investigations found that neither light nor dark peppered moths actually rest on tree trunks.  Those famous pictures?  They are a result of light and dark dead moths being pinned onto tree trunks to `illustrate this point!'  Again, Neo-Darwinists admit the pictures were staged, but they continue to be found in texts as they do nicely illustrate Neo-Darwinist evolution.

Neo-Darwinism is promoted by censuring theories and ideas that contradict Neo-Darwinism, and by intimidating those who make trouble for the establishment:

This is perhaps the most serious and to the extent true, frightening criticism made by ICONS.  The film presents the case of Roger DeHart, a high school biology teacher in Washington State who wanted to supplement biology classes by presenting recent evidence contradicting Neo-Darwinism.  However, the school board, frightened by threats of lawsuits from organizations defending Neo-Darwinism (ACLU for example) repeatedly prevented him from doing so.  It is understandable if they squashed the teaching of fringe theories such as Intelligent Design or Creationism- however, they prevented DeHart from teaching evidence troublesome to Neo-Darwinism appearing in mainstream science publications, and even papers such as the WALL-STREET JOURNAL!  They even prevented him from presenting a paper by the famous Neo-Darwinist Stephen Gould, in which he admitted that Haeckel's embryos should not appear in biology texts.  The given reason?  High School students are supposedly not capable of evaluating claims from cutting-edge research and should be taught simplified science.  Needless to say, a number of students were offended by such a conclusion.

The film understandably claims that case of DeHart is the famous Scopes trial turned upside down:  In the 1925, biology teacher John Scopes was censured from teaching evolution in classrooms by hostile creationists.  Today, biology teachers such as DeHart are censured from criticizing evolution by hostile Neo-Darwinist Evolutionists.

While watching the film, one must keep in mind that the film is not balanced (it clearly has an agenda, and majority of the experts are critical of Neo-Darwinism- a number of them are proponents of Intelligent Design).  Despite its bias, one cannot deny that the film is very reasonable.  It does not present, much less push, alternate theories, not even Intelligent Design.  Rather, it presents solid evidence against Darwinism, evidence that is accepted by Neo-Darwinists.  It also asks hard, troublesome questions.  But isn't that what science all about- to ask those difficult questions, and follow the evidence wherever it leads?",1168214400,14,8657,5.633976833976834
173834,3,0972043306,"The Icons of Evolution is a well put together critique of the teaching of evolution. I like that they kept any mention of Intelligent Design or Creationism out of it.

This video is a good starting point for good constructive and mind opening discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of the theory of evolution as it stands today. As supporters of Intelligent Design I think the makers of this DVD should be commended for keeping this video an honest critique of what is being taught in science classes here in the US and not a propaganda piece pushing their take on biological history.

173835,5,0972043306,"I had heard about this DVD and finally decided to buy a copy.  Some of the reviews here caused me to be curious since I have been studying the creation/evolution and intelligent design/evolution debate for many years now.

After watching the DVD I am now interested in buying the book by Mr. Wells.  What's really fascinating to me is that you don't get the standard ""creationist"" stereotype in this DVD that you might expect.  Sure, I am a creationist and I believe ""creation science"" is indeed a valid approach to science.  However, it is more powerful to have an unbeliever make your arguments than a believer, especially in this area of critiquing Darwinian evolution.  One of my favorite scientists used in this DVD is Dr. David Berlinski, who openly claims to be neither ""fundamentalist"" nor ""Christian.""  He magnificently and intelligently explodes the myth that if you disagree with Darwinian evolution you must be some crazed and/or stupid ""fundamentalist"" Christian with a religious agenda.

If Darwinists/atheists were to be truly honest, they would have to admit (as some on this DVD do) that some of this clearly circumstantial ""evidence"" for Darwinian evolution could just as easily apply to a common Creator as ""common descent"" with mutational modification and natural selection.  But alas, honesty is not necessarily what we get from rabid evolutionists like Richard Dawkins and his followers.

My only complaint about this DVD is that it was too short and didn't go into more detail.  Perhaps there will be a ""Icons of Evolution 2: The Evolutionists Strike Back""? LOL.

What are so many people afraid of when it comes to this dogma?  Why can't even evolutionary high school teachers like the main ""character"" in this DVD even provide students with evidence of the very real problems in this theory?  The sad fact that they ignore in this censoring tactic is that it is backfiring.  Even when the popular ""liberal"" press gets the facts wrong and labels all who disagree with the ""establishment"" on evolution as ""creationist fundamentalists,"" the controversy and bad press actually aides the cause in getting out the truth.

When I see dogmatic evolutionists like a previous reviewer simply ad hominem attack the DVD instead of bringing forth cogent and intelligent arguments from science at least attempting to refute the points made by credible and educated Ph. D. scientists, it lets me know all the more that their little evolutionary world is crumbling beneath them and they just can't stand it.  And they can't raise a rational or scientific argument (or review) against the facts.

WE need more videos like this out there and we need this to be put out on national television for more people to see.  Kudos to ColdWater Media and all of its associates in producing a fine documentary exposing these icons (with high production value and great graphics) and the biased and uncritical mentality behind them.

Don't blindly believe the hype.  Evolution is not, never has been (and apparently never will be) some established fact of science like a round earth.  It is pseudo-scientific dogma that is being exposed for what it is left and right, from creatonists to atheistic scientists.",1166054400,7,3204,5.028409090909091
173836,5,0972043306,"In the past 20 years of studying this problem, Biology is now entering what can only be described as a revolution. Because the evidence is so overwhelmingly against the conventional neo-darwinian view, scientists and scholars that hold to this THEORY are abandoning it like rats abandoning a sinking ship. More than 100 scholars (from Yale, Princeton, Smithsonian and MIT) have signed onto a statement declaring they are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged. This declaration ran as an ad in the Prestigious New York Review of Books. In life's big bang, the Cambrian explosion, most animals appear in a very sudden sense. From nothing, we have almost everything, almost overnight. This remains mysterious. Nobody understands how this happened (except for me, I know). The Cambrian explosion puts the various phylum of the Darwin tree of life upside down so that it is an upside down tree. The Cambrian explosion does not conform to the Darwin THEORY of the tree of life.

173842,4,0972043306,"This was a wonderfully produced work, but at a mere hour I felt it was too short to cover the points in the degree of detail required. It is however a great introduction to the recent push towards introducing a little real science into the Darwin-vs-other theories debate. This DVD does not examine the other theories, only seeks to show that what schools teach about evolution is just not factual.

Like the book by Jonathan Wells, this is brief but devastating  examination of the so-called ""proofs"" of Darwininan macro evolution.

Darwinist insist that evolution has been thoroughly proven scientifically. If you ask an advocate of Darwininan macro evolution what that proof is, they will almopst allways respond by citing one of the ten ""Icons of Evolution"".

These icons can be found in most biology textbooks at high school to college level and are in fact the foundation of evolutionary theory. Advocates refer to many of these ""Icons"" in books and lectures as proof positive that Darwinian evolution is fact.

Unfortunately these ""facts"" simply do not hold up to scrutiny. In fact these ""facts"" are in some cases are actually fraudulent, faked. No only that but the Darwinists all know it and will admit when pressed! Yet they still use this ""evidence"" to support the books and lectures and papers and tenure. Huh? I thought we were talking about science here.

In regard to the reviewers who are giving this DVD a single star, well it's obvious by what they write or do not write that none have even seen the documentary which really is about what we expect. Darwinists do not want to examine evidence. They do not want questions. They want belief. Further, thay want UNQUESTIONED belief. Doubt that? Try asking one a few pointed questions then stand back with you fingers in your ears.

Seriously, just try asking questions to a Darwinist. As Fred Reed observes it's like trying to give a prostate exam to a bobcat. You'll get everything but what you asking for: answers.

They'll call you a crank, insist that you are an enemy of science as if someone who asks questions is an enemy of science. They'll say you don't know anything, ( maybe thats why I'm asking questions) I used to think science was about questions and answers and religion was about beleiving in something you didn't understand or couldn't prove. Darwinists turn that upside down and the single-star reviewers just make the point for me better than I could.

I'm glad they are here ""reviewing"" something they've never seen or read. That aspect illustrates the problem of these self-described ""scientists"" who have no understanding of real science. They are not interested in knowledge or evidence. In fact thats the LAST thing they want! These ""reviews"" say that better than I can.

I don't expect this to change the minds of the entrenched orthodoxy however. I am reminded of the following wisdom: [from a real scientist]

173845,5,0972043306,"In 2002, Jonathan Wells published a book entitled Icons of Evolution. This book was subtitled, Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrong. Wells, formerly a firm believer in evolution, had come to realize that much of what is taught about evolution is just plain wrong. Many ""icons of evolution,"" such as Darwin's ""Tree of Life,"" Haeckel's drawings of embryoes that look remarkably similar to each other, and the ever-famous Galapagos Finch had long since been proven to be mere myth. That these are myths is widely accepted in the scientific community, even by advocates of evolution. And yet these icons live on, taught as fact in science texts used in grade schools and in colleges. Wells' book ignited a firestorm of controversy that continues to this day. It was responsible for convicting many to abandon or seriously question their faith in Darwin's theories of evolution.

Icons of Evolution (the DVD) is an hour-long video presentation of Wells' findings. While certainly nowhere near as thorough as the book, the facts are still as compelling and every bit as devastating to Darwinism, and perhaps more importantly, to Neo-Darwinism.

Produced by ColdWater Media, this DVD is well-made and well-produced - this is no amateur presentation. From the menus to the extras and to both the video and audio work, the production is solid throughout. The disc includes several bonus features, such as ""10 Questions to ask your Biology Teacher,"" answers from experts to frequently asked questions about evolution (highly recommended!), along with a list of suggested printed and online resources.

Icons of Evolution is appropriate for any audience, but would be most valuable to middle school, high school and college students who will surely encounter most or all of these icons as part of their education. Parents of these students would no-doubt benefit from it as well. The video concludes with several high school level students voicing their concern that they are not considered sufficiently intelligent and discerning to be taught various theories as to the origins of the world. Do they not gain more by following the foundations of the scientific theory even as they attempt to understand the origins of life? Why is it that Darwinism is considered fact - the only valid and responsible explanation?

This presentation focuses far more on disproving the icons of evolution than on teaching Creationism. In fact, Creationism is rarely mentioned. Many of the scientists interviewed are not Creationists, but are believers in evolution who are sufficiently honest to admit to the growing number of problems inherent within this explanation for the origins of life. Perhaps that increases its value. Of course by disproving many of the foundations of evolution, I am confident that viewers will be led the only plausible alternative, which is Intelligent Design. Surely the origins of life can only be adequately explained by admitted that where there is Creation, there must be a Creator.

That's why they dare not raise objections to any of the points made in this evenhanded presentation of the problem - why falsehoods supposedly known to be such by evolutionists - in some cases for many decades - continue to be presented in textbooks as fact.

Evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould agrees that Haeckel's embryo drawings were false, yet claims that since evolutionists have known this for umpteen years, it's a moot point. Wasn't he concerned that Darwinism had to resort to known falsehoods as ""evidence""? Why is teaching falsehoods a moot point? Certainly he can expect it of those wicked theists, but isn't Gould a scientist?

Similarly, why aren't evolutionists up in arms about the fact that the feet of ""Lucy"" were altered to look more human, when allegedly the entire evolutionist community knew her feet were unhumanly curved, quite like an apes? Where is their thirst for accuracy and self-correction?

Jonathan Wells became an atheist through being indoctrinated with Darwinism. I would wager he has more scientific credentials than either of those two dishonest ""reviewers"": he has degrees in geology, physics, molecular and cell biology, and religious studies, and has worked as a post-doc research biologist. After rediscovering the wonder of creation, he explored various religions, taking him to  gurus and swamis, and finally back to theism - ironically, the foundation of most of today's sciences.

Chesterton wrote that ""As an explanation of the world, materialism has a sort of insane simplicity. It has just the quality of the madman's argument; we have at once the sense of it covering everything and the sense of it leaving everything out. ... For we must remember that the materialist philosophy (whether true or not) is certainly much more limiting than any religion. ... The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe. But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle.
