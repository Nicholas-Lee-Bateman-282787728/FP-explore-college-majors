8024906,5,6304198949,"What a great series! This series has a young, pretty girl who may have to be sacrificed in order for the human race to survive. Her friends, Kusanagi and the members of the TAC, don't want her sacrificed so they do everything in their power to try to save Momiji. Great animation, fun characters, and an absolutely terrific storyline. The dubbing is also great. You'll love Momiji: she is not the smartest person(tests scores at school) but she is not ditzy, and she is absolutely courageous in the face of monsters. Her relationship with Kusanagi is fantastically developed. A great anime.",988070400,,590,4.851485148514851
