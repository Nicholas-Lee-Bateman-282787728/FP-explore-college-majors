663427,2,6303492495,"This follow up to the brilliant 1983 classic ""A Christmas Story"" is a pretty disappointing affair. The movie does not hold the same magical quality and nostalgia as the holiday movie. Kiernan Culkin and Charles Grodin taking over for Peter Billingsley and Darren McGavin, were no match for the pitch perfect performances of the latter two. Mary Steenburgen takes over Melinda Dillon's role as Mom. The film deals with Ralphie's young childhood in the 40's. Kind of bland and boring. If your a ""Christmas Story"" fanatic like me, you will be disappointed as well. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not what one would of hoped it would've been following the previous classic.",1007769600,10,677,4.844827586206897

If you've never heard of Jean  Shepherd or Xmas story maybe you won't get much out of this movie, but for  Shep fans like me, you WILL love it!",953424000,13,411,4.259740259740259
663430,4,6303492495,"Jean Shepherd was a sadly under rated talent.  Although this may not be his best material -- his book,  ""Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories"" contains his finest stories -- so much of his work was live  ephemeral radio broadcasts that any of it fixed into a more durable form is  worth having.  In that sense,  this video is a ""must-have"" for  Shepherd fans,  even if the acting and production aren't up to the  standards of his earlier film,  ""A Christmas Story.""  It's still  a good film,  full of humor that can be appreciated at almost any level by  almost anyone.  If it's not his best,  so what?  Few writers or comedians  today could equal even a mediocre Shepherd effort.",946857600,24,683,4.55
663431,4,6303492495,". . .well, you know, A CHRISTMAS STORY.  And that, my friends, is where we all go wrong when we see a flick that's closely related to what's now a family classic.  This movie is not nearly as sophisticated as it's  predecessor and we can pick it apart for all it's worth just because it's  so different.  Personally, I'd like to have seen Darren McGavin play the  Dad again but hey, Grodin holds up well and if seen as a separate movie on  it's own, it has lots of funny vignettes that are all in Shepherd's  stories.  I thought the funniest scene was when the Bumpus's come dancing  over to their horrified neighbor's house. This is a very funny FAMILY  picture that can be watched with no qualms about language, subject matter  and yet, it's an adult's view of growing up in the 40's.  Don't let cynical  naysayers keep you from trying this SMALL CLASSIC.",936230400,46,857,4.445161290322581

I just picked up the Blu-ray and I found it to be a worthy sequel in almost every way! Sure, Charles Grodin is no Darren McGavin, but the rest of the cast is solid and some of the kids even resemble the original actors. There's even a cameo by Ralphie's Red Ryder bb gun along with another warning not to ""shoot your eye out""! The same dry humor, silly situations, Shepherd narration and clever antidotes about life in 1940's Indiana make this a worthy addition to you library. Is this as good as A Christmas Story? No, but after 35 years of nostalgia and airings of A Christmas Story could ANY movie live up to that film?",1460073600,,851,4.3924050632911396

663633,4,6303492495,"I have always loved ""A Christmas Story,"" and when I found out that this was the sequel to that movie, I knew I had to see this!

Now right away it's not as good as the original film was, but it's still very enjoyable.  The film expands on what Ralphie is like in the summer months and also introduces a new bully to his school since he beat up his old bully.  It also shows us more about the war between the Old Man and the Bumpuses next door to them.  Now that was something I really enjoyed!  Those dogs from the first movie were funny and the family who owned them were so funny I actually did laugh out loud a few times.

There are other little things in this movie that make you laugh, like the mom going to ""dish night"" at the movie theater, Ralphie and his Old Man going fishing, the little brother still refusing to eat, their new dog they got, and the fights with the toy tops, all these things make the movie very enjoyable and the characters relatable.  Ralphie's BB gun does show up in the movie briefly and he doesn't shoot his eye out but he does have an accident with it that will make you laugh!

The only complaint I have about the movie is whatever happened to Ralphie's glasses?  In the first movie he needed them for everything.  In this one he just seems to need them when he is reading and writing.  I guess I can forgive this one little thing since it doesn't really impact the rest of the movie.

If you liked the first one, you will enjoy this sequel to it.  Check it out!",1425254400,,1497,4.15625

663638,4,6303492495,"While the direct-to-video ""A Christmas Story 2"" claims to be the ""official sequel to A Christmas Story"", this film is the REAL sequel and to me it does feel more like an actual sequel to the famous original.  Having Jean Shepherd narrate the film goes a long way in selling it as the true follow-up.  They also re-use some of the familiar musical cues from the first one.  Though they didn't seem to try to cast someone who looks like Christmas Story's ""Ralphie"" (completely different hair color and most of the movie the actor isn't even wearing glasses) Kieran Culkin is still a pretty strong actor and he holds his own.  Scut Farkus (different actor) is back, although he's now relegated to the status of ""toadie"" and the new head bully is just... freakish.  Charles Grodin does a pretty good job as The Old Man but Darren McGavin is sorely missed.  Mary Steenburgen is her usual sweet, beautiful self as the mother.  Im a big fan of the book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash by Jean Shepherd so it was a lot of fun watching some of the other non-Christmas Story tales play out on the screen.  We finally get to meet the Bumpasses mentioned in the previous movie, and they're just as Redneck as you might have imagined.  The only thing this movie seems to miss is a  big payoff moment near the end.  All in all though it was an enjoyable movie  recommended for fans of the original or anything Jean Shepherd.",1420588800,7,1415,4.463035019455253

663640,4,6303492495,"a couple years ago a film materialized that was enough to put even my ardent sequel advocacy to the test. where Ishtar or Last Action Hero was a ""bomb,"" A Christmas Story 2 is a full-scale nuclear holocaust!
you can already tell you're in not-so-good hands by it's clumsy title. for all my sequel advocacy i do have one recurring beef: i get really, REALLY sick of the way they just tack numbers onto 'em. it's not cute anymore, and it's frankly just lazy. NAME THE DAMN THING!!
(what would've been wrong with ""Another Christmas Story""? not much more creative, i grant you, but at least it's grammatical.)
and of course, any film that bypasses the theaters and goes straight to home video, well, maybe it doesn't DEFINITELY signify disaster, but it's still not a terribly encouraging sign.
i'm not here to dwell on the wretchedness of that film, though. what makes it worth mentioning is that it's a classic case of truth being stranger than fiction. the job the film set out to do had already been done. yup, that's right: there ALREADY WAS a sequel to A Christmas Story!! and a much worthier one, if only because director Bob Clark and writer/narrator Jean Shepherd were still at the helm. (mercifully, neither lived to see the aforementioned abomination.) it's one of the all-time great tragedies of cinema that this delightful film would come and go so unnoticed. (interestingly, it was released in 1994, the same year as the very most underrated film of all time, The Shadow. i wonder if there's some cosmic significance there...)
a decade had passed, even though the film was set in the following summer, so some recasting was inevitable. most notably, the parents have morphed from Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillion to Charles Grodin and Mary Steenburgen, and the Parker children are now portrayed by the younger Culkin brothers. (the only player to manage the transition is Tedde Moore as Miss Shields.) on the whole everyone does a pretty good job of channeling their predecessors, even if nobody seems to be trying anything new with the characters. Grodin effortlessly projects the (sort of) loveable prickliness you'll never forget in McGavin, and Steenburgen fits the harangued but loving matriarch role as neatly as had Dillon. Kieran Culkin is a little more jarring because his presence and performance style are a bit removed from that of Peter Billingsley, but he knows the sort of person he's playing and can sell it in good time if you'll just indulge him.
and in any case, the true star of both movies is Jean Shepherd. the film borrows, as had it's ancestor, from his book In God We Trust All Others Pay Cash, as well as another one, Wanda Hickey's Night Of Golden Memories & Other Disasters. complete with the same (mostly) grandfatherly narration, the film prickles just as effectively with Shepherd's unique brand of jaded but fond nostalgia.
as the summer begins, Ralphie finds himself at odds with a new neighborhood bully. this new nemesis specializes in war via tops in a chalk circle, and our hero's primary quest is for a fitting top with which to defend his honor.
life ain't no picnic for his parents, either. the eccentricities of their hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, have grown out of proportion, and The Old Man declares war. arranging a forthcoming fishing trip with ""the gang"" is also complicating his life. Mother, meanwhile, struggles to keep a step ahead of the county assessor, who might auction off the family's assets if they should seem overly affluent. (this particular sort of villain was enabled by conditions of the Depression.) another source of frustration is the premium being offered by the local movie theatre. it was intended that, over the course of a few months, each attending housewife was to receive progressive pieces of a dinnerware set, each bearing the likeness of a star actor of the day. but there's been some kind of clerical error with the shippers, resulting in the same Ronald Colman gravy boat for weeks on end. and Mrs. Parker isn't the only one who's less than pacified the manager's repeated promise of a ""trade-in"" when the proper item finally arrives.
in short, this film may not be quite as artful as A Christmas Story, but it does manage to create the same charming ambiance amid the same semi-dysfunctional family unit. it's a worthy companion piece, especially if you've ever wondered what life was like for the Parker family the rest of the year.
so why didn't the film get the respect, or at least affection, it deserves? as i understand it, the big problem was a phoned-in ad campaign which didn't make clear the lineage to A Christmas Story. (not even the title was safe: studio muckety-mucks made Clark rename the film It Runs In The Family, then let him reinstate the original title only because Kirk and Michael Douglas made a film of the latter title several years later.) it's not unheard of for worthy films to get lost in the shuffle, but this one seems to of had a helping hand into obscurity.
this is as fine a slice of Midwestern Americana as it's ancestor had been, and it's lack of stature would be a shame even if said ignorance hadn't enabled A Christmas Story 2.",1418947200,,5164,4.790358744394619

663781,4,6303492495,"It's the last day of school in the steel town of Hohman, Indiana, six months after the happenings of ""A Christmas Story"". That puts it in 1936 or 1937, because Ralph Parker's dad (""the old man"") is reading a newspaper headline about the Great Lakes Exposition (Cleveland's centennial celebration).

The big deal on the playground that year is fighting tops, and one theme of the movie is Ralph's quest for a killer top. He bikes all over town to find a top that could vanquish Lug Ditka's Black Mariah. Lug is the new big bully - Scut Farkus is actually one of his minions. As the narrator, the adult Ralph Parker, indicates: ""Skut Farkus, my old enemy, had been demoted to bully second-class.""

""My Summer Story"" (1994, 85 minutes) cannot compare to ""A Christmas Story"" (1983), but it does have some funny scenes. Such as Mrs. Parker's machinations to fool the Personal Property Tax Assessor. No, no, we have no new nice things in this house!

The scenes with the Bumpus family, next door, are a little forced, but I got a kick out of the narrator's telling us that in plural, they are called the Bumpai.

Charles Grodin plays Ralphie's dad, and though he has the vocabulary down, he doesn't have the lovable irascability of Darren McGavin's portrayal. He does have a funny scene where he's explaining to Ralph why the fish aren't biting: ""It's television. Television. You know, that new experimental stuff, radio with pictures. ... They're sending television waves all out everywhere. It's killing the fish. It's exploding their brains!""

The narrator is the star of the show. Jean Shepherd, himself, narrates, as in the original film, and he has a great story-telling voice. According to the credits, this movie is based on two of his books, ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash"" and ""Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters"". But I'd like to recommend his stories in audio format, if you can find them. He originally told all these stories on public radio, and they are a hilarious listen, funnier than reading the stories, I think. Some of the titles start with ""Shepherd's Pie Slice One"", two, three, four, etc.

Slice Four has the story of The Great Orpheum Gravy Boat Riot, which is more funny on the audio cassette than in this movie:

The roles are miscast-especially Ralphie and Randy as the kids playing them are too young and don't act very well.  I love Jean Shepherd's stories and have re-read the written forms of them many times and still enjoy them.  Some of the major problems with the film:

1. Tried to cram in too many of Shepherd's stories into the plot and made all of them shallow and poorly developed.

2. The stories they did put in were significantly modified and made silly/stupid instead of staying true to Shepherd's writing.

3. Stupid stereotypical Hollywood characters--cheesy Hillbilly neighbors, the ""bully"", Ralph's friends turned into nerdy runts.

4. What's with the dog Barkley?  Another attempt to make the movie ""cute""?

Dad's frustrations and foibles were not dealt with in the misguided yet excusable manner as they were when Darrin McGavin took on the role. Charles Grodin's wooden portrayal of Dad left me feeling no sympathy, conjuring images of a cynical misanthrope bent on ""winning"" and nothing else. Randy was a complete empty hole in this movie, the role wasn't even necessary, and Mom was almost completely disconnected from the story.

I am a big Jean Shepherd fan and so I had no problem enjoying this movie.  It took a little while to get used to the new actors, but they all held up.  In fact, Mary Steenburgen as the mother is an improvement -- her acting was nuanced and touching.

I don't know).  The reason ""A Christmas Story"" was such a hit is because it involved Christmas and it was seen by people that had never heard of Jean Shepherd and were pleasantly surprised to find out what a great writer and a practitioner of the lost art of storytelling he was.  Those of us who listened to him on the radio knew that not only could he write but he was one of the funniest people going ""off the cuff"".
This film, as well as ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"" (if you can find a copy), should be taken as an independent film.  It would be nice if the same actors were used in all three films but the actors used in each film do a good job.  If you treat each film independently you will find each one funny and enjoyable and in the laid back style of Shepherd's humor.  There was nothing more enjoyable than listening to Shepherd tell these and all his other reminiscences, live on the radio.  Even now when I read his books in my mind it is his voice speaking the words.  The TV show ""The Wonder Years"" used the Shepherd style of first person narration as did the film ""Lean On Me"".
Shepherd was a one of kind personality and I am so glad that a lot of his audio is available and that he did the narration on these films and that even if only portions of his stories are used in the films they are well worth having to watch every so often and remember what good storytelling is like.",1289606400,2,1565,4.158940397350993

There was no chemistry between Grodin and Steenburgen AND the story was totally different from the Ollie Hopnoodle film with James Sikkus, that I'd seen years ago, which was hilarious. A VHS version of this movie, USED starts at $70...a little expensive, I think.",1261872000,,603,4.854368932038835
663963,3,6303492495,"As others have mentioned, it's best not to see this as a sequel to ""A Christmas Story"". The casting isn't as good in most cases and the story isn't as compelling. If you hold this film to its predecessor's high standard, it will pale in comparison. When viewed in its own right, it makes for decent family entertainment.

This isn't quite as family-friendly as ""A Christmas Story"" due to its language. Both Mr. Parker and Ralphie use ""son of a bitch"" a few times in the film, so it's not quite appropriate for smaller children. Ah, but didn't Ralphie use the same word in ""A Christmas Story""? Yes, but because it was used once in an otherwise sanitary film (unless one thinks of ""Oh fuuuuudge"" or his garbled pseudo-profanities blurted out as he beat up Scut Farkas as dirty words), Ralphie's sigh of disappointment ""Son of a bitch!"" was powerful and funny. When used repeatedly by Mr. Parker it was just trite profanity.

Mary Steenburgen makes an excellent Mrs. Parker with a fine balance of sweetness and intimidation. Usually it's the former, but as she returns to the theater for the eighth time to exchange her Deluxe Pearleen gravy boat for a matching platter her threat to Ralphie (""If you mention fishing to Randy again I will kill you"") carries weight. Charles Grodin is the weakest major character in the film. Darren McGavin played a curmudgeonly father with occasional streaks of good humor, but Grodin plays a humorous father trying hard to act curmudgeonly. This is an enormous difference. If you haven't seen ""A Christmas Story"" it probably won't bother you. Kieran Culkin plays a passable Ralphie.

Others have criticized some of the other characters as ""too cartoonish"", but it's good to keep in mind the film is a reminiscence of an adult about his childhood. Memories become exaggerated after time, and this can easily account for the ultra-hillbilly nature of the Bumpass family next door. Over the top? Yes. Does it work in this film? Also, yes.

History fans will also have to suspend their objections at anachronisms. The story is ostensibly set in the late 1930s (judging by the cars and other props used), but one act in the film shows the family going to the World's Fair in Chicago (the 1933 Century of Progress Expo). This also can be attributed to a faulty childhood memory as this is not a documentary.

My 9-year old laughed at a number of the slapstick scenes and generally enjoyed the film, so I will give it 3 out of 5 stars. It's worth a rental or maybe a purchase if on blow-out sale (I picked up my copy for $3), but it probably won't take its place next to ""A Christmas Story"" in your DVD/Blu-ray collection of perennial favorites.",1248739200,3,2670,4.696581196581197

664040,2,6303492495,"""A Christmas Story"" is one of my favorite movies.  I've seen it countless times and could probably sit down and write out the script from memory.  I was excited when I found that another Parker family adventure was out on DVD; and best of all, it featured voice-over by Jean Shepherd, and was directed, once again, by Bob Clark!  It might sound good on paper, but as hard as it tries, ""My Summer Story"" doesn't recapture the charm of the original due to poor casting and a weak story.

My first complaint is that the film relies too heavily on references to the original film.  The film begins with a clip from ""A Christmas Story,"" and lines of dialogue are lifted from that film continuously.  This is especially prevalent during the first half hour, when all of these references just go to show how weak this sequel is in comparison.

Gripe #2: The casting for this movie is terrible.  Ralphie acts nothing like he did in the first movie; Kieran Culkin does a fine job acting, but didn't quite nail the character.  The same can be said for Charles Grodin as the Old Man.  Randy is almost an afterthought here (he has relatively few lines, and when he does talk, he's always whining or repeating himself).  Flick and Schwarts are in the film, but they're almost identical and I couldn't figure out which one was supposed to be which.  Scut Farkus is also here, but portrayed by a much younger actor who looks incapable of bullying anyone.  Scut has been demoted to the lackey of a new head bully, Lug Ditka, who doesn't really seem to bully anyone aside from verbally abusing them.  On the bright side, Ms. Shields is played by the original actress, who provides one of the film's best performances in a scene where she deals with Ralph after he turns in a book report based on a dirty book he found under the Old Man's mattress.

Gripe #3: Jean Shepherd's voice-over is a huge letdown.  I figured that even if the rest of the movie was terrible, I could enjoy listening to Jean's unique take on the events.  While his narration in the first film was clever and full of sophisticated word-play, the lines he delivers in ""My Summer Story"" are dumbed down and won't be much of a mystery to anyone over the age of six.  Wherein the narration of ""A Christmas Story"" served as an accompaniment to the film's visuals, the narration here generally doesn't add much to the scenes.

Finally, the plot is passable, but far less entertaining than ""A Christmas Story.""  ""My Summer Story"" is a collection of short stories, involving an illusive killer toy top, fishing expeditions, a visit to the World's Fair, and a war with the hillbilly Bumpus neighbors.  The correlation of these subplots isn't very clear until the end of the film, when the narration provides a heavy-handed moral lesson that draws everything together.  Some of these stories are better than others, ranging from the entertaining toy top saga to the embarrassingly bad feud with the Bumpus family.

So there you have it.  ""My Summer Story"" isn't a horrible movie, but fans of ""A Christmas Story"" will most likely be disappointed.  People who haven't watched ""A Christmas Story"" might find this movie mildly entertaining, but 90 minutes would better be spent watching the original.  Definitely not worth the MSRP of $20, I would only recommend this DVD as a rental, or a purchase if you can pick it up for under $10.",1231545600,3,3375,4.63973063973064

664042,5,6303492495,"Ralph Parker is the 10-year-old Indiana boy you may remember from a little film called ""A Christmas Story"". Well, from his following summer comes ""My Summer Story"", the tale of Ralph's search for the ultimate killer top to defeat the new head bully, Lug Ditka, the Old Man's war with their hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, Mom's gravy boat incident at the Orpheum Theater, a trip to the World Exposition, and that all-important first summer of fishing with the Old Man and his buddies.

Before I get into assessing ""My Summer Story"", class, does everyone here realize that Ralph Parker and his family ""existed"" well before the American holiday favorite, ""A Christmas Story""? To date, there have, in fact, been 6 films about Ralphie, Randy, Mom, the Old Man, Flick Schwartz, and company. Three of them even aired before ""A Christmas Story"" was even released. I say ""aired"" because, in fact, 4 of the other Ralphie films were made for PBS's American Playhouse, airing in 1976, 1982, 1983 (okay, not truly sure which appeared first in this case, as A Christmas Story was released in '83 as well), a much later one in 1989, and then there was the feature film sequel we are reviewing here in 1994. You may remember seeing these other Ralphie movies throughout the years on Disney Channel replays. These wonderful films were all based on the writings and radio stories of a true king of all media, Jean Shepherd.

One of America's greatest humorists, Shep's semi-autobiographical tales of the Parker family probably appeal to most because of something he actually claimed to be against (yeah, right), nostalgia. Set in the 1940's and high on Norman Rockwell/Walt Disney type Americana, I don't doubt that many of us Jean Shepherd fans are the same folks who have a devoted love for Mama's Family, the Carousel of Progress, apple pie, and Ernest movies. Whether you grew up in such an all-American setting and lifestyle as the Parkers or just wish you had, there's a charm to it all even when presented with Shep's scoffing reality checks. And that realism and our mix of nostalgic feelings for both the good and bad moments of growing up are what make all the Ralphie films must-sees if not must-owns.

So, to break it down for the many folks who consider themselves major ""A Christmas Story"" fans but don't even know about the other films, here are some descriptions of them, all narrated by Jean Shepherd, though with other cast members frequently changing:

1976 - The Phantom of the Open Hearth - Ralph is attending the prom. Yes, the TV films were all about a teenage Ralphie. This one also gives us the original film versions of the leg lamp story and the Orpheum dish-night fiasco, and the amusing build-it-yourself house story. It's my least favorite of the Ralphie films to watch though, because it's a bit depressing and probably the hardest to acquire a good copy of today, but still very enjoyable.  Never released officially on VHS or disc. Ralph is played by David Elliot here, and the Old Man by the wonderful James Broderick. Mom is played by Barbara Bolton.

1982 - The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters - Matt Dillon plays Ralph in this one! It's probably my favorite of the Ralphie movies outside of ""A Christmas Story"". In it, Ralph goes on a disastrous blind date, marches in the 4th of July parade with his school band, and gets tangled up with Schwartz in a picnic race against their weasely buddy, Flick. Meanwhile, Mom takes up a washrag chain-letter, neighborhood drunk Ludlow Kissel surprises everyone with a firework from hell, and the Old Man puts on a fireworks display to thrill the masses. It's a must-see on every 4th of July for me, along with 1776, The Patriot, and Johnny Tremain. Great fun! James Broderick and Barbara Bolton return in this one. A wonderful, heartwarming holiday film. Sadly, another that's still only available under the table.

1983 - The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski - Another delightful one here. Teenage Ralph finds his first serious love in his new Polish neighbor, Josephine, but at her family's big Thanksgiving celebration he learns how serious a few dates can be with some families, and it's escape now or wind-up like his pal, the former high-school basketball star thrust too soon into adulthood. This one also explores the Old Man's bad habit of buying used cars and Randy's turn at playing a turkey in a school play. Good movie to watch on a Thanksgiving evening or anytime, but, again, not available officially on VHS or DVD. Forget about Blu-Ray. Ralph is well played by Peter Kowanko here, with George Coe as the Old Man and Barbara Bolton returning as Mom. Katherine Kamhi plays Josephine Cosnowski.

1983 - A Christmas Story - I'm sure you know this one. Ralph, 10 years old and played to perfection by a bespectacled Peter Billingsley, is on a holiday quest to insure himself the gift of a Red Ryder BB gun. A perfect movie and a Christmas classic. The Old Man is also played to perfection here by Kolchak himself, Darren McGavin, and likewise Mom played by Melinda Dillon. Easily available in any format I know of, and currently running for 24 full hours annually on one of those cable networks that starts with a T. At some point, inspired by this film, my family gave up the virtual repeats of Thanksgiving dinner on Christmas Day to instead go out to a local Chinese buffet. We never looked back.

1988 - Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss - The Parker family returned to TV in this one, as we see a barely teenage Ralph, played well by a young Jerry O'Connell of ""Sliders"" fame, getting his working papers and his miserable first job. In addition, the family dog, little Fuzzhead, runs away. The bulk of the story, however, is the family's maniacal road-trip to their favorite fishing haven, Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss. Another great cast brings another great Ralphie tale to life with the delightful Dorothy Lyman of ""Mama's Family"" as Mom and James Sikking nicely portraying the Old Man and feeling quite a bit like McGavin's version without it seeming intentional or forced. Available only on VHS so far. I believe Disney holds this one, so I wish they'd quit sitting on it.

1994 - My Summer Story - Well, you already got a synopsis for this one, I'll get more into it below. The Old Man is played here by Charles Grodin. Some folks say he seems to be trying to be Darren McGavin. Personally, I only got that feeling a wee bit when he sounded like he was trying to talk like him in a couple parts. Mostly, he seemed to be playing it on his own and he's enjoyable in the role most of the time. Mary Steenburgen was well cast as Mom, and Kieran Culkin plays Ralph well enough, but Peter Billingsley is a tough act to follow. The only returning cast member, aside from Jean Shepherd narrating as Adult Ralph, is Tedde Moore as Ralph's teacher, Miss Shields. This one was made for the big screen, originally titled ""It Runs in the Family"". I don't recall it ever actually going to theaters, at least not in my area. Probably had a limited release. The title was wisely changed to ""My Summer Story"", and the fact that another MGM release is titled ""It Runs in the Family"" likely causes some confusion at times for folks looking for this film. ""My Summer Story"" has been released on both VHS and DVD. I prefer the VHS cover to the ""house wrapped in a straitjacket"" DVD cover, but whatever. Neither is great nor reminiscent of the ""A Christmas Story"" poster artwork. The Ollie Hopnoodle's VHS cover is much better.

And that's the breakdown. If you find any one of them to be excellent outside of ""A Christmas Story"", then you'll probably love all of them. However, I realize a lot of folks will only love ""A Christmas Story"". It's a little different from all the others. It's got a charming, hazy quality and a bit more fantasy to it. It more perfectly portrays a child's viewpoint than any of the other Ralphie flicks, though most of the others show him as a teenager, so that's natural. And, of course, it's a Christmas film, and this is what most folks love about it. It shows an American Christmas the way many of us remember it, flaws and all. The other Ralphie films do the same for growing up, but that doesn't have as wide an appeal without the Christmas subject.

 To get more specifically into ""My Summer Story"", here's what I have to say about it. It's not perfect as a follow-up to ""A Christmas Story"", but if you love nostalgic and/or family stuff, you'll love this. It's not totally unfair to compare to to ""A Christmas Story"", of course, and I know everyone is going to. The tricky thing though, is that when you bring Christmas into the mix, forget it. Christmas beats everything. Christmas rocks, I won't argue it, and what better setting for a film about the good and bad times of childhood? Nevertheless, all the Ralphie films are good films, including ""My Summer Story"". Granted, ""My Summer Story"", being the only big screen sequel to ""A Christmas Story"", is the Ralphie movie that tries the most to copy the style of ""A Christmas Story"", and this is both good and bad. It's good when they pull it off, and with the same filmmakers behind it (like A Christmas Story, this one was directed by the late Bob Clark), you'd think they'd pull it off totally. The problem is when the attempt to be like ""A Christmas Story"" is obviously forced. Lacking that lovely haze of an early '80's film, ""My Summer Story"" tries to recapture the more lighthearted elements of ""A Christmas Story"" with a few moments of silliness most noticeable in the Old Man's feud with the Bumpuses. For me, these are the weakest parts of the film, because the Bumpuses are just a bit too cartoonlike and some of the feuding moments that are supposed to be hilarious don't quite work for me. And this brings up another little problem that hurts ""My Summer Story"". This time around, Jean himself does seem to go a little overboard with his boisterousness during the narration in a few moments, seeming to be trying to make events sound more tremendous than they really are, like Ralph's book report troubles in the beginning. However, boisterous narration and the Bumpus sections aside, which aren't totally without humor and entertainment value (loved the use of Barkley the dog), most of the film is full of Jean Shepherd material with the same spirit and narration as the others. The quest for the perfect top and the ensuing battles, the classic gravy boat incident, the taxman's visit, the World Expo, fishing with dad and the serenity of a perfect summer's night, it's truly wonderful, family entertainment. Unlike many sequels, you don't get the same old events from the previous film. That's not a problem with any of the Ralphie films, unless you count the fact that the gravy boat and leg lamp incidents took place in two of the PBS specials before they made it to the theatrical releases.

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mean to sing the praises of this film too much. In some ways, even though I rank it higher personally, it is the weakest of the Ralphie films. It certainly has a more ""aimed at the kids"" feeling than the others. I found out a short time ago that Jean Shepherd was very unhappy with this one, which is sad to hear. Apparently, director Bob Clark allowed Shep very little input this time around, and the result is more kiddie and sappier, and emotionally forced, than previous Parker family movies. I forget all that Shep had to say about this one, but I know he really didn't like the casting (Grodin particularly). To cite something else I didn't love, there's a scene during a face off with the bully in which Clint Eastwood's famous spaghetti western tune plays. This being set in the 40's, that was really unfitting for a kids' fantasy! You don't see problems like that in ""A Christmas Story"". So, yeah, this film has issues when even Shep didn't like it, but I still find it to be a very enjoyable Ralphie film.

When all is said and done, is ""My Summer Story"" a great movie? Yes. Is it as good as ""A Christmas Story"", no, but it's still great and well worth owning if you like nostalgic family films, Jean Shepherd, or any of the cast. I'd rank it about third in the Ralphie films myself, right after ""Great American 4th of July"", ""Ollie Hopnoodle's"" dragging close behind (though better in some ways). Though most oldschool Shep fans probably will tell you the three first films (from PBS) are the best, maybe even better than ""A Christmas Story"", because they are far less sappy and sweet. Not me though, I'm a Disney guy even more than I'm a Shep fan, so that stuff doesn't bother me. ""A Christmas Story"" is one of my very favorite films, period. Anyway, I was thrilled when ""My Summer Story"" came to DVD. There are no extras, but at least we get a beautiful, widescreen transfer. It's a shame Shep didn't get to make a Halloween related movie. We need more Halloween flicks, and it probably would have been a big hit. Think of it: ""A Halloween Story"". However, I'd just be happy if the other Ralphie flicks would make it to DVD. They're long overdue.

Update: You may or may not have heard about the soon to be release ""A Christmas Story 2"", coming direct to DVD. It's toting itself as the ""Official"" sequel to ""A Christmas Story"", as if this one was not. Well, you can watch the trailer online already, and it is really... something. Amazingly, they have done a great job capturing the look of the first (better than My Summer Story did, sadly). Tragically, the acting and lines do not impress (and why does Ralph look like a dummy this time around?). Of course, it looks like they are just trying to do a lot of copying and referencing to the first, too. Okay, sure, this was a bad idea from the start. Shepherd and Clark are deceased (who in the world is narrating this, I wonder?), and the cast is all new, and the writing is clearly contrived, direct to video sequel kinda stuff. Still, when I see the production values and the way they managed to capture the look of ""A Christmas Story"" in the trailer, I do wish they had somehow found a great writer and great actors for it. Oh well. We shall see how it goes. I mean, how can I NOT see it?",1217721600,78,14183,4.613312202852615
664043,4,6303492495,"The story of the Parker family continues. My family enjoyed this film, though not as much as the infamous Christmas story. From the blasting music to the early morning fishing, they related to the turn of events in the story just as if it had happened to them.",1211155200,,260,4.4375
664044,5,6303492495,"If you enjoyed ""A Christmas Story"", you'll love this story too.  Different actors, same Jean Shepherd midwestern humor.  Shepherd has a knack for telling the story of his childhood upbringing that is both nostalgic and humorous.  Being a midwesterner myself, these stories are about as real as it can get.

Now if you can find it, try to also see ""The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters.""  It too is a Jean Shepherd classic that you do not hear much about because it was made for TV.  If you can find it, get it.  I was lucky enough to find it, and it is as much a holiday tradition for us (In this case Independence Day) as ""A Christmas Story"" is at Christmas time.

Thank you Jean Shepherd for bringing back our childhood with good humor and in good taste.",1200182400,3,773,4.394366197183099
664045,2,6303492495,I saw this movie some years ago..it seemed better then than now. It was till funny in parts. Grodin overacts and is literally the worse actor in the movie...,1198800000,,157,4.448275862068965

And did you know the movie 'Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss' is also a Jean Shepherd movie...a continuation of Ralphies Life in his teenage years. Now-when will that one be out on DVD??",1191456000,,356,4.650793650793651
664111,4,6303492495,"This movie tells the story of the summer after the events in ""Christmas Story"".  I didn't expect it to be as good as the first movie, and it isn't, but this film has a lot of good moments of its own.  No, Ralphie doesn't get his eye shot out, but he does get shot somewhere else in a moment of real hilarity.

  Then there are the hillbilly neighbors (remember the dogs? they're ba-ack!). I,m still not sure why their back porch concealed a huge pool of mud, but we get some funny moments out of that.  Charles Grodin as the Dad gives a different version than Darren McGavin, but funny in its own right, especially when gleefully shouting ""son of a bitch"" at the neighborhood cop.

  Mary Steenburgen gives a really wild performance as the mother, especially in the tale of the gravy boats.

  Kieran Kulkin is very good as Ralphie, but Christian Kulkin gives a good performance as the kid brother, especially in the scene where he shoots Ralphie in the somewhere else. for a part that is mostly mute, he still manages to steal a few scenes with just a handful of facial expressions.

  If you loved ""Christmas Story"" you'll like this movie",1180051200,4,1140,4.492682926829269

664113,4,6303492495,"A ten year old boy helps his dad in a ""war"" against hillbilly

neighbors, and also finds himself on the way to manhood when Dad takes

him fishing, while Mom leads a revolt against the ""Ronald-Coleman-gravy-boat-again"" Dish Nights at the local theatre. The same boy tries to beat the school bully in a ""top"" competition...an episode of The Simpsons? No--it's the sequel to A Christmas Story: Jean Shepherd's ""My Summer Story"", aka

""It Runs in the Family"".

Shepherd again narrates. He was a legendary humorist and radio personality who indirectly inspired the song ""A Boy Named Sue"" and whose Christmas tale has become a cult hit thanks to cable TV marathons. Here, we get to see Ralphie at a time of year when boys DON'T try to stick their tongues to flagpoles. The Old Man is played by Charles Grodin, whose gruff manor--but at times, joie de vivre--is in the spirit of Darren McGavin,

who played that role in ACS; while Mom is played by Mary Steenbergen

(Back to the Future Pt 3). And if Shepard's narration makes you

think ""Wonder Years"", be aware that ""A Christmas Story"" used the

""adult narrator recalling his youth"" device several years before

the ABC series came about (wonder where they got the idea!)

Very funny, warm hearted, and nostalgic.

Being born & raised in Cedar Lake, IN this movie brings back great childhood memories of me & my girlfriend growing up on Cedar Lake. We did ALOT of fishing & I was in total shock when I 1st seen that this movie was partially about Cedar Lake. I can't pick this movie apart like others, all I can say is it's a very fun, good hearted movie.
