3508537,5,B001CCVFPO,"I purchased this DVD because I did not want to spend a lot of money at a Bikram studio.  I also found that I did not like how the Bikram instructors presented the class when I attended my local studio.  However, I really enjoyed the sequence of asanas from Bikram and found that the video is a great alternative.  I especially like how the narration is calm and soothing.  I am a beginner and I find that the modifications are helpful.  Super purchase.",1233792000,141,452,4.397590361445783
3508538,4,B001CCVFPO,"I have always enjoyed Bikram and Barkan methods of hot yoga, but when I became pregnant, I needed an alternative. This DVD is the best that I could find with regard to practicing these postures at home. The two yogis in the video position themselves at different angles so that you can better visualize their technique. The practice session does not last an entire 90 minutes as the studio classes do, but I don't mind. After finishing the DVD I feel as if I at least maintained my flexibility, however, I am not sweating. Overall, I am glad that I own this DVD.",1231286400,9,562,4.466019417475728
3508539,5,B001CCVFPO,"I have tried so many different types of yoga DVDs, (small town with no class) and this is totally my favorite. Other yogis are intimidating, even on the tube, but this guy actually encourages you to enjoy yourself! I hope I can move the way the blond woman, Lisa Taylor, moves. Btws, when emailing Mr. Barkan, I found out she's the wife of Chad Taylor, the guitar player in Live!!!

Anyway. Rambling done. Basically, loved the DVD, you should try it :)",1219276800,7,452,4.512195121951219

3508551,4,B001CCVFPO,This dvd is the closest thing to being in an actual yoga studio.  The only thing I don't like is that it is an hour long and I don't have time to spend an hour doing yoga everyday.  It would be nice if it included a shortened 30 min or even 45 min version.

3508557,5,B001CCVFPO,"I LOVE this DVD.  It's perfect for beginners and intermediate students. Maybe advanced, too, but I wouldn't know because I'm not advanced. It's challenging for me, but it's getting easier.  I can't do all the poses correctly yet, so I modify them to the best of my ability. I like the pace of the class, the calm, helpful tone of the instructor's voice, and the variety of poses.  At the end, I feel loose and relaxed everywhere, including my brain!  I'm not crazy about all the deep breaths at the beginning.  They're necessary, but repetitive.  Instead of doing the entire set with elbows bent and hands clasped under my chin, I do about half just sweeping my arms overhead and then down, which breaks the monotony for me.  If you tend to be a bit antsy (like me) keep going through this part.  It's a really good and really fun workout, and it's great for de-stressing!",1420848000,2,872,4.544871794871795

3508570,5,B001CCVFPO,I was looking for a cheaper way to practice my Bikram yoga other than the studio down the road that charges $99 a month and provides no child care....I FOUND IT! 99% of the postures in this video are the same as Bikram with a few new and pleasant postures added. I also love how my class went from 90 mins down to 60. His voice is very soothing and the tutorial is very thorough if you happen to be a beginner. I really enjoy this DVD and it's a great price!,1410739200,8,458,3.989130434782609

This is a great replacement if you want to follow a similar practice at home.  The differences are that there is a bit of flow at the beginning for a warm up.  Then, each of the poses are only done once, not repeated twice as in a Bikram class.  Overall a great substitute for a Bikram like practice.",1405987200,7,417,4.098765432098766

I use a space heater in my spare bedroom to get the temp up to about 85 degrees, and I break a sweat (which is a big deal for me since I have medical issues, and don't typically sweat when most people are drenched).

3508585,5,B001CCVFPO,"I just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. I didn't want to sign up for a class because I don't like being in close proximity to other people; if I can smell you, I'm done. Also, I really didn't want to do the whole 105F degree thing either, I hear you aren't allowed to leave the class once it starts. I have phobia about feeling trapped so I would not do well.

I really like the pace of this yoga. I'm already becoming much more flexible in just a couple of weeks. I was having shoulder/upper back pain and it's honestly gotten a lot better. I use this DVD at least 3 times a week.",1396915200,3,590,4.042735042735043
3508586,5,B001CCVFPO,Cloesest dvd to Bikram yoga. Its a little over an hour and you only hold the poses once. The guy talking has a pleasant voice. I am glad I purchased this for the days I cannot make it to my yoga class,1395619200,,200,3.7857142857142856
3508587,4,B001CCVFPO,"I wanted a DVD or audio version of bikram...which is impossible to find.  This however, has almost all 26 postures, and includes some sun salutations as well.  Each pose is only performed once and not twice in a row, so that is the biggest difference.  However, I am using this workout in addition to my gym classes such as chisel and dance, so this is great for flexibility and people who love bikram and the consistency of the poses.  You can heat up a small room with an electric heater to help achieve the bikram affects.  I'm happy with this DVD.",1390867200,3,551,4.415841584158416
3508588,4,B001CCVFPO,"I like this dvd. It is simply the poses demonstrated, nothing fancy or intense. I used to go to Bikram Yoga classes (hot yoga) twice a week. I now live where there is no Bikram class to go to so I bought this tape to keep the poses in my muscles. Glad I did.",1388448000,2,258,3.7962962962962963
3508589,5,B001CCVFPO,"I did Bikram yoga a few times a week, for a couple of years, then got busy and broke so I quit going. The nearest studio is 30 minutes away, and that would take 2 hours out of my day to practice regularly.

Enter the Barkan Method....I love this dvd! I have a spare bedroom, a tv, and a space heater, so I am able to do hot yoga whenever I want. I have been doing Barkan's yoga for a month now, 6 days a week, and at first, I was dismayed by how much flexibility, strength, and balance that I'd lost. But I have been steadily improving, so yay!

I have found that this yoga method is fantastic for my rotator cuff (tendinitis) and my piriformis. I love that Barkan has a lot of poses during the floor series that really hit the piriformis muscle. This has helped me immensely. Now, if I could only get my hamstrings to loosen up....

3508592,4,B001CCVFPO,"It is definitely a great alternative to going to the yoga studio. It is a little slower, but it can also be hard because you have to hold your poses longer, because they take more time in between each pose. I have taken hot yoga classes like this before, where they don't just jump from one pose to another and I still get a great workout. I would recommend it!",1378771200,,361,4.171428571428572
3508593,1,B001CCVFPO,It seems to be more instructional as to how to do the specific moves as opposed to an yoga routine which is what I really wanted.,1378684800,,129,4.0
3508594,5,B001CCVFPO,"I've now been doing traditional Ashtanga yoga about 4 1/2 years but am still only to Marisiana D in the primary series; so I consider myself an ""beginner to intermediate"" practioner. Earlier this spring I suffered a supraspinatus/rotator cuff tear and and I had to severely modify my regular practice. I read some other reviews about how folks prefer this method to Bikram, so I figured I'd try it.
Jimmy Barkan's teaching style is great. His voice is very pleasant, the narration is pefect, giving the right amount of detail. The tutorials are great and the structure of the class and poses are prefect for me. There are some really difficult ones not in my Ashtanga practice that are a great help to me.  Now I can do continue to work into more difficult yoga poses while waiting for my shoulder to heal fully.  Thank you Mr. Barkan.",1377302400,,835,4.635135135135135
3508595,5,B001CCVFPO,"I was paying to go to hot bikram classes at a studio, but I just couldn't afford it.  Luckily I found this DVD which is exactly the same poses that we would do in the hot room.  Honestly, not being in a 110 degree room was also wonderful.",1373932800,,238,3.9375
3508596,5,B001CCVFPO,"I bought this video because although I love the hot yoga workout, I was unable to get to the Bikram studio due to scheduling issues, additionally, these studios require a monthly $$ commitment which was a little more than I wanted to spend. . I was hoping that I would still get a good workout and simulate my own hot yoga at home at my convenience.  I LOVE THE DVD!! The Barkan method DVD is awesome! It's an hour long and easy to follow.  just like in the studio, you can make the session as challenging or modify each pose to suit your physical condition.
To get a good sweat going I use my sweat suit,by Kutting Weight Clothing, purchased here at Amazon, along with Sweet Sweat also purchased here on Amazon (see link below).

3508598,1,B001CCVFPO,"I was so disapointed with this dvd.  I have done yoga in the past, but i don't consider myself an expert.  However this dvd is way too difficult.  They expect you to hold those intricate poses and at the same time concentrate on really intricate breathing techniques.  Most of us are not yogis and i found it so difficult and frustrating.  i would not recommend this dvd to anyone that is looking for some basic yoga poses.  the whole idea of of why i do yoga is for meditative purposes, how can i be in a meditative state when i have to concentrate on so many things at once.  Very unrealistic.",1371340800,3,595,4.306306306306307

3508600,5,B001CCVFPO,Love this video. Just the ticket for someone wanting to start a hot yoga practice at home. Tired of the Bikram script and all the Bikram narcissism (does anyone really care about what the latest 24 year old mcteacher de jour learned when they were in training?)  Jimmy Barkan's video with its detailed alignment instruction and thoughtful navigation is for you! I'm not affiliated with Barkan in any way. I just know a strong yoga teacher when I see one.,1368748800,2,454,4.675
3508601,5,B001CCVFPO,"The DVD offers a 60 minute session that's derived from, and heavily influenced by, Bikram's beginner's series. I prefer this DVD to a live Bikram class because (a) the instruction is clearer by far; (b) modifications are offered; (c) you can watch a tutorial for a detailed explanation of any asana; (d) the session begins with sun salutations, which are absent from Bikram's beginner's series. I wish there were some discussion of how to determine how long to hold an asana, and more discussion of the breathing while in each asana, but I can't expect perfection. I'll settle for excellence.",1367020800,4,592,4.93

The Barkan Method is NOT the same sequence as Bikram, but it does contain some of the same poses. I currently use yogaglo because I crave variety in my yoga practice, but my boyfriend still swears by this DVD and uses it 3 times per week.

Jimmy Barkan has a soothing voice. The class has 2 yogis, one man and one woman that demonstrate the pose and a modified version. It's saved me money and encouraged my BF to do yoga, so I will forever hold a place in my heart for Jimmy Barkan.",1361318400,5,659,4.061538461538461

I purchased this DVD based on the other reviewers positive remarks regarding the non-harmful way that this DVD is presented, and the reviewers were spot on.  I like the attention to safety, body alignment, and the pace of the DVd.  I was able to complete the entire DVD in one session...maybe not exactly like the two in the video, but with the encouragement, I knew it was okay to work toward a goal.",1343520000,6,628,4.522123893805309
3508635,4,B001CCVFPO,"I read Bikram yoga and wanted to give hot yoga a try, when I ran across ""The Barkan method"". I feel - outside of attending a studio -  this is one of the best video resources available to incorporate hot yoga into your daily routine. The asanas are straight forward and well explained. The only area I feel could use improvement is the instruction regarding breathing.  There are times where he will instruct to inhale/exhale before the actual move, and it's not clear if the instruction pertains to before the move, or during the move.

On another note, I practice the yoga at room temps and have had no issues. I'm not sold on the idea hot yoga needs to be performed in 105 degree heat - which is supposedly the temperature it's practiced in it's native Calcutta. I've never been to Calcutta,  however weather data has the hottest months (Apr, May) topping out at 95. So unless they practice yoga at the hottest time of day, w/a space heater, not sure how they routinely practice in 105 heat.  In fact, even in Bikram's book he states they routinely performed yoga at the crack of dawn which happens to be the coolest time of day - so again, 105 doesn't add up..",1343001600,13,1164,4.471698113207547
3508636,5,B001CCVFPO,"Okay I just got back from my first session with this DVD, and WOW, love the results. I had joints and muscles ""pop"" about 15 times now, some during the session, but also an hour after. In the following places: 1) Right kneee 2) Both hips 3) Tail bone 4) Left hip flexor 5) Neck 6) Right shoulder 7) Right shoulder blade 8) Spine between shoulders 9) Low back

I got this DVD, along with about 4 others, to work on my flexibility. I am a guy who is bulking up and have always neglected flexibility, so this time I wanted to do it right and keep everything loose. I also work on the computer all day so you can imagine what that does to posture and flexibility. This is a really practical DVD and time efficient in my opinion. If you come from a sports history, you will recognize alot of the stretches, but many I had never seen before. Using the heat and the sequence here is a real beauty of this system, and the poses were not that hard to learn (though many will be difficult to master). I really liked how they had two instructors doing the poses side by side, and then the narrator giving detailed instructions. Having two instructors lets you view the ""beginner"" and the ""advanced"" poses, in case you are having trouble with one.

I also do literally feel centered balance/posture wise physically, but also, spiritually (wasn't expecting that I was just in it for the physical effects). My next steps will be to get a thermometer as instructed in the video, and I am also going to get a neck/shoulder yoga video as well to complement this one. So I do weights Mon-Wed-Friday, and then yoga Tues-Thurs and they complement each other really well. I highly recommend this to any weightlifter that needs to work on flexibility, I only wish there were more days in the week to practice it because it's so much fun. I may update this review after long term use.",1339545600,8,1861,4.422740524781341

This series is well-thought out and beautifully presented. Jimmy Barkans' narration is PERFECTLY paced; his voice is calm and each pose includes instructions within the narrative on how to modify the pose to your needs whether due to injury or lack of strength or flexibility.  I, too, was a Bikram student who got tired of both the COST and the militaristic attitude.  Jimmy's DVD is calm, peaceful AND a real workout.  IF YOU HEAT YOUR ROOM, YOU WILL SWEAT BUCKETS. Even more wonderful than the workout and presentation, is the built-in tutorial for each pose which you can access either separately OR during the course of the 1 hour class.

3508653,2,B001CCVFPO,"No new poses or interesting flows.  Barkan narrates the video.  The tutorials are not great compared to many other dvds.  FYI, Deb Dobin has a nice tutorial section.  Unless you put the heat on 95 degress or higher, this class is likely to cause injuries to beginners especially because their bodies won't be hot enough to perform a couple of the poses.  That being said; it is NOT an intermediate dvd.  I used a space heater and did it when I was not feeling well and it still bored me.  It should have ended at 30 minutes, not 65.  I have many yoga dvds for all levels; ranging from 30 to 90 minutes that put this to shame.  I wish I could get my money back.
But I gave it 2 stars because it's a good pace for a heated room; just a not a great practice.  A few times he throws out words about engaging bandhas but doesn't give explanation of how.  The woman on the dvd has red hands and feet; which grossed me out.  The transition from standing poses to floor poses is really bad.  No inversions either.
You are better off just using a beginner yoga dvd or a slower paced one and putting the heat on.

P.S. I think the body should create some heat on it's own; not just because of the heater.  This dvd does not deliver on that end; so save your money.

P.S.S. I apologize for ripping this dvd apart; but I had to be honest :)",1298937600,4,1328,4.12890625

I have never done ""Bikram"" before, I found the instructions perfect, the poses were explained and I got something new from each pose, although I have done versions of them before.

By the time I got to pigeon pose my hips were well opened and got the deepest I have ever been in in that particular pose.  I slept really well last night, and will definatley be leaving it in my DVD player for a while.  Wish this instructor had more DVD's he was great and his voice and instructions were helpful to each pose!

I enjoyed that each pose was held for longer than some Yoga DVDs I have, it gave me a chance to really get into the pose and think about how to open them better.  Love it.  Highly recommended.",1288569600,9,920,4.247126436781609
3508658,5,B001CCVFPO,"Whenever I cannot make it to the Bikram Yoga studio I pop this DVD in!  I like how Barkan incorporates different poses in the routines, but I didn't feel that the workout was as intense...maybe because I wasn't in a heated room, or maybe because each pose had only 1 set instead of 2 sets.  All in all...if you're new to hot yoga, or just want to get an idea of what hot yoga would be like...this is a great way to find out (minus the heat).

There are modifications to the poses which is really great for beginners and advanced yogis!  These modifications helped me in my regular practice with Bikram Yoga.  The DVD is very easy to follow.  If you want the ""full"" experience...get a mini heater blowing on you while you follow this DVD!",1288224000,6,737,4.343065693430657
3508659,5,B001CCVFPO,"I purchased this after a couple of other DVDs that weren't any good. I have gone to Bikram yoga classes and I lov ethem, but i have to agree with some other ratings, that they are real expensive.  Also, some a way too structure; the water, the time you take, etc.. ( i do like structure, but not the feel of being in the army)
Mr. Barkan is soft, his pace is slow, but not too slow for each pose, he explains it well and the DVD has even a button you can press if you need more details about a pose.  In addition, he shows you how to modify each pose because there are two people doing the poses and one of them is always modifying it.  I also feel that he incorporates spirituality, talks about the chakras, etc and this is great !
It is not ""exactly"" like the Bikram classes, but the most similar i have found and i even enjoy some of the new poses in it that Bikram doesn't have.
With all this said.... I HIGHLY recommend you get it if you are looking for a good alternative to Bikram - But at home...
P.S- its about an hour and he doesnt do the poses twice like in the Bikram class.... But who has time for 90 minutes everyday ??.

If you have ever been to a Bikram class they are a bit militant and you may wonder if it is really yoga at all. The Barkan method is very similar without the boot camp style instruction. Anyway, it is a pretty good DVD if you understand the intention. So heat up a room, dress down and enjoy the ride. Namaste, John",1284768000,4,414,4.060975609756097

my only real beef with this DVD is that he doesn't always seem to give equal time in the moves when say, he switches from one leg to another. most notably with the standing head to knee pose. most of the time he gives equal amounts of time but some poses are just a little too imbalanced I feel. I also would love maybe a little more explanation about the intervals of what my breathing should be because I feel like sometimes he's going at a more rapid pace than at other times. but HEY maybe the breathing and length of time devoted to poses doesn't matter! what do i know?

BUT i love it nonetheless. and i definitely recommend it for beginners, like me.

I have viewed and practiced this video for the first time and am SO HAPPY I have purchased it!  The actual class lasts about 60 minutes. The poses are VERY similar to the 26 Bikram poses. Each pose is only performed once, but there is adequate time to go deeper into each pose (but not too much time!). James Barkan narrates the class and offers many valuable hints for stretching deeper or utilizing modifications for beginners. Also, his voice is very soothing and encouraging.

I tried Hot Yoga, but couldn't stand the heat, humidity, and overcrowding in the studios. I was thrilled to find the same poses I loved from Hot Yoga in an easy to follow DVD. Using this workout at home is very convenient and I've never felt better. Each pose seems to balance with the one that follows it. Just did a back bend? Let's lean forward and stretch out the other side. Don't be intimidated when you first start. Stick with the first 38 minutes, that is where the real work is done. After the standing and balancing poses, the floor poses are a welcome relief. I feel so open, physically and emotionally after finishing this workout.

I can't travel an hour to the yoga center every day (as is suggested with Bikram yoga), and though it was very helpful, I just couldn't travel. Bikram won't release a DVD because they want people attending the studios. That's all well and good, but some of us just can't do it.
THIS IS NOT A BIKRAM KNOCK-OFF!
I found the format easy to use, complete with tutorials, and the pace is easy to keep up with. I like that they use modifications and stress being gentle with our bodies if we have issues. The asanas are a workout but you can still do what you can, and gradually, you'll keep up.

3508671,5,B001CCVFPO,"I have been reading up on Yoga for a while and discovered Bikram Yoga after an article about Jenny McCarthy and her experience doing it at her home. I looked into classes and either it didn't work with my schedule or they were very pricey.

I have several books but wanted a DVD that went through the movements to get the feel of the flow of this particular style of Yoga. I also wanted a challenge and something that would make me work.

Well, this DVD does all that. What I like about it is that it has the tutorial which goes through each movement with lots of detail. Also it has a feature during the class section. All you have to do is click on it and it will bring you right to the tutorial if you need some more detail, which is pretty cool.

I definately think the reviews that state its not a power workout or the fact you won't sweat are a bit misleading. If you do this workout the way you are supposed to in a ""hot"" room, and you continue to challenge yourself going further with each movement you will sweat.

For me I just use a portable heater and turn the fans off, and that creates a perfect enviroment. I don't know if its the ideal temp which I believe is slightly over 100 degrees, but I think as long as its warm enough to work a sweat that is the key thing, as you could really hurt yourself otherwise. I would think a humidifer would work as well to create the enviroment too.

Also I saw that there was a complaint about it not being detailed, which is a bit misleading as well. With the tutorial and the ability to reference it during the class, I think it's very detailed for a DVD. I think if someone is look to delve into the finer, nitty gritty details, then I would would suggest to purchase a book as well. I have done that myself and I think that is key to learn about this form of yoga in the fullest sense.

Anyway, I will definately use this DVD as part of my regular routine. It's a great economic alternative to classes and if you challenge yourself you will feel and see the results.",1240617600,129,2022,4.171794871794872
3508672,5,B001CCVFPO,"This DVD is everything and more than I expected. I had gone to ""Hot Yoga"" classes in the Denver Area and found them to be quite militant and unfriendly to newcomers -especially since I expressed that I had tennis elbow and might need to modify some things for my arm. This was met with an attitude that clearly communicated that I might as well not do the class if I had to modify anything! Also, during the class we were told repeatedly not to move to even scratch an itch on our noses or heads or fix out ponytails etc and the instructors were constantly overwhelming everyone new with too many rules to  even take in 90 minutes! I thought I was dealing with the Yoga Military Police! They were polite but, very strict.

In any case, I found the Bikram's instructors in the actual classes in Denver to be very stand-offish, superior, and artificial. Also, their perfect bodies and their underwear-like yoga outfits were way over the top for me. I am not interested in survival yoga or the yoga olympics! I just wanted a good anti-aging, and destressing stretch after a hard day at work!

Conversely, I found Barkan's DVD to be gentle, not a yoga-competition, and it offers multiple chances for modification for beginners. This is perfect and saves a ton of money, since I don't have to pay for those over-priced classes or parking or gas to get there! Its the perfect at home solution. And if you need to take a break or scratch your nose no one is going to give you the evil eye or the raised eyebrow!
