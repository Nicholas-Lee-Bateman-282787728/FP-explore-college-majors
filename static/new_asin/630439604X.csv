865545,5,630439604X,"This is a serious work-out for serious results. I rate it as 5 stars because it is effective, well cued, well organized and delivers great results. Whether or not this would be a good workout for you will depend on several factors:
If you hate exercising and are looking for something that would motivate you to get off the couch for 20 minutes this will probably not be the best choice. This is geared towards serious exercisers who do not need/want bright settings, cheery instructors and the cast-having-a-blast atmosphere to keep them going.
For those of you who lack the time be warned, this is an hour long work-out. Also although it is called a cardio work-out this is not all aerobics. You work with weights, but you do so in a manner that keeps your heart rate up and you DO get a good cardio work-out. The FIRM cardio workout was designed to be done alternatively with FIRM Strength workout, where the moves are slower and weights are heavier. Alternating these two gives beautiful results.
If having a room full of equipment bothers you, don't bother picking this tape up. You will need a set of dumbells (3, 5 and 8 lbs recommended) and two step boxes 8-10 inches for cardio, 12-14 inches for sculpting. Ankle weights are optional but recommended.
If you do have the time, the equipment and the commitment then this is a great choice. You will see results a lot faster than with traditional beginners work-out tapes and for maximum results you may want to alternate this with the FIRM Strength tape as recommended. You may also want to try FIRM Tortoise and Hare cross trainers for variety.
This is a fairly advanced work-out, although not as difficult as the original FIRM classics in my opinion. Still, it gives great results and is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a thorough body workout (upper body, lower body, abs, cardio etc) and does not need a ""motivator"" for an instructor who keeps telling you to keep going and not give up on him/her. Heidi concentrates more on giving exceptional cueing and instruction on proper form. The only non-instructional thing she says is ""that was tough"". It was!",1025049600,85,2123,4.709677419354839
865546,2,630439604X,"I own 4 Firm video tapes and rate their top at 5 stars.  This tape however, really is not that good.  Very confusing transition between exercises that make it difficult to enjoy the workout.  It is frustrating to keep up with the frequent changes.  Again, not thier best.",976233600,2,271,4.583333333333333
865547,5,630439604X,"OUCH!  I have 9 FIRM tapes - this is one of my favorites. It had me walking like an 80-year old woman the next day.  I hadn't been that sore in a long time.  But the first time I did it, it obviously strengthened my muscles because I did not have the same problem after that.  I have been working out daily for the last 6 months and still cannot get all the way through the abs and legs sections of this tape - it is incredibly challenging, and the aerobics section maxes out my heart rate every time (you really should use a heart-rate monitor with this one so you don't have a coronary).  If you feel brave enough, this WILL get you in tip-top shape, and you can have fun while doing it.",975024000,8,689,4.074074074074074
865548,5,630439604X,"I purchased this video and Firm Strength at the same time and I love them both.  I find this one a bit tougher than Firm Strength, but I look forward to my workout each day, no matter which one I'm doing.  It's very effective  to alternate the two of them.  I like this tape more and more each time I  do it.  Great cueing and motivation from the instructor.  Get ready to  sweat!",964224000,8,380,4.109589041095891
865549,5,630439604X,"I got this video and Firm Strength at the same time, but I didn't like this one as much the first couple of times I did it.  Part of the problem was that I didn't have the right size step for the step aerobic sections  (6""-8"" is recommended I think).  But once I got the right size  step, I have to say this is a great workout.  Unlike Firm Strength which  works one muscle group to exhaustion at a time, Firm Cardio goes from upper  to lower body so you have some time to rest one half in between.  Despite  the word cardio in the name, this video only has 3 short cardio sections  interspersed with the weight work.  The rest is full of muscle shaping and  building activities, like tall box (12""-14"") presses, lunges,  overhead presses, etc.  There is some great hip and thigh work in this  video towards the end that really works well (and be careful unlike me who  was sore the next day).  They say on the video that you can use a barbell  for some of the weight lifting, but everyone in the video is using a  dumbbell.  The instructor has a pleasant voice and good form.  If you like  Firm Strength, you'll like this one too!",963532800,19,1131,4.235849056603773
865550,5,630439604X,"Being a devoted FIRM Fitness video user I am not sure why I waited so long to try this video, but when I finally did I was very impressed by its effectiveness.  The style is the same as the original 5 FIRM videos, but  with a more current feel.  The music is a little more upbeat, but the  workout is challenging and spiced up my workouts.
I do enjoy this  video and would recommend it for anyone.  I also liked its partner video  ""Firm Strength"" and suggest that they are used alternately for  peak efficiency.  Definitely a better purchase than the FIRM Tortoise and  Hare pair!",953164800,16,580,4.386792452830188
865551,4,630439604X,"its a tough weight & very tough leg workout. cheesy lady that leads you though, really cheeser. ""ooh that feels good."" ""that was  tough"" ""oh yeah, one more"". haha. the workout has tons of  lunges so be prepared. you do need hand weights & leg weights &  some sort of a step for this tape. not very much abs or stretching on this  tape. it is very long & pretty good. just ignore the lady & if the  lunges are too much just do something else while they do that.",940982400,19,460,4.066666666666666
865667,5,630439604X,"I had this workout on VHS years ago and was so glad to see it and the companion ""Strength"" workout released on DVD format.  I have almost all the Firm DVD's and this is one of my favorites.  The title ""Cardio"" is a little misleading because it's not a traditional cardio workout in that your moving large muscle groups continuously without a break, like jogging, dancing, or stepping.  Instead, it alternates upper and lower body exercises with weights at a slightly faster, but still controlled, pace.  There are also step and dance cardio segments included in the routine and a floor abs/glutes segment.

I felt like every muscle was worked in this DVD.  It's awesome!  I think this workout is suitable for almost all levels.  If it's too hard, don't use weights at first. As you progress and it starts to get easier, add more weight.  The instructor is great at cueing and the pace is on point; when doing low impact four-limbed dance moves, the weight moves are always controlled.  The lunges, dips, and step-ups are done at a comfortable pace, which I appreciate because I have a bum knee.

You will need the fanny lifter box or a step with risers, ankle weights, and a set of 3-5-8 lb dumbells to start.  The ankle weights are optional for beginners.  A lot of people use a rubber maid step stool instead of the fanny lifter.

Note:  I prefer the classic Firm workouts from the 1986-2006 as opposed to the newer ""pink"" logo ones.  The pink ones are fine, but they aren't as weight training intensive as the classics, which is what I gravitate towards.  So if that also sounds like you, you will probably love this workout.  I also like the Fitprime and Kickbutt workout series that the original creators of the Firm went on to produce.",1363737600,6,1741,4.597402597402597
865668,5,630439604X,"Being a longtime fan of the Firm, I have tried many if not most of their workouts.  For some silly reason this was one I did not try for the longest time.  There are many snippets of it in various ""Firm Parts"" tapes, but I never felt the need to acquire the workout.  Finally I came to my senses and snagged a copy of it.

This really is a great workout, though the title is a bit misleading.  It's not a true cardio workout, there are cardio segments, but the workout is designed to keep the heartrate up giving the workout a cardio effect.  You alternate between upper and lower body work, with cardio segments in between.

There is quite a variety of exercises, for lower body you will do squats, leg presses, lunges, dips, plus some bridge and table work that is done on the floor.  The table work is especially tough, I don't even use ankle weights.  The upper body is covered well also, pushups and chest flies, bicep and hammer curls, french press, tricep dips, one arm rows, overhead presses, lateral and rear deltoid raises.  For cardio you will see a couple of step segments and a 4 limb aerobics segment.

The Firm uses a lot of equipment, you will need a short and tall step.  I invested in a high step a few years ago which was a really smart buy, I use it for my Firm workouts a lot.  You will also need dumbells, I used an assortment of 3-20 lb dumbells, a 20 for the one arm lat rows.  Ankle weights are optional, the table work is tough enough that you really don't need them.  You will also notice they use a 2 x 4 for the squats, I believe it adds range of motion but I don't think it is necessary.

If you don't have a tall step, a stool would work just fine.  I use my step at 6 inches for the aerobics and 12 inches for the tall box work.  I used to use 14 inches but I am more comfortable at 12, I feel my form is better and 12 inches is still plenty high.  They recommend the shorter step be 8 or 10 inches, I personally think this is too high.  Although the step segments are short, so 8 inches would probably be fine for some people.

While I have and enjoy Firms from all eras (classics to pinks), I like the middle era Firms the best (post classics to BSS series).  This pair of Firms, Firm Cardio and Firm Strength are among the best workouts that the Firm ever released.  While the Tortoise and Hare are certainly good, I much prefer this set.  The library set might be kind of dark and dreary for some, it has never bothered me.  Heidi Tanner is a great lead, to my knowledge this was the only Firm workout she led.  I thought she did a really nice job.

The bad news is that this workout is hard to find.  But the creators of the Firm are in the process of releasing many of the classic Firms to DVD, so who knows maybe we will see a remastered version of this one too.  I hope so!  5 stars!",1356393600,3,2823,4.117216117216117
865669,4,630439604X,"I found her warmup to be very hard to follow but the workout was much better! I liked it. Step aerobics, weight lifting, floor work. You need a lot of stuff: short box, tall box, 2x4 board, towel & weights. Through the years I've collected all that stuff. I found it challenging and I did break a sweat!",1342051200,,303,4.241379310344827
865670,5,630439604X,"I have many firm videos in my collection and I have to say this is one of the best (along with Firm Strength being equally as good)

The weight lifting segments focus on traditional exercises with no awkward bending and straining, and are gentle on the joints.
The movements are also done at a good pace (not too fast or too slow, so you can really concentrate on the movements with heavier weights, which has given me by far the best results)

The cardio segments are kept simple (no silly movements, no awkward straining) and use lightweights to maintain your heart rate.

Once again, the cardio segments are just enough to keep you sweating, and not too much to burn you out on the next set of weighted exercises.

All and all, this is a very effective and efficient work out. You will definitely feel your muscles worked and your joints will not be aching afterward.

As a side note, the music isn't the greatest and this is an older video, but the ACTUAL workout is very good.",1291852800,5,981,4.48876404494382
865671,5,630439604X,"This is a great  workout for cardio. It's about 60 mins long. It will get your heart rate up. It also has strength segments which are also great too. The instuctor is friendly,and her cueing is excellent. This video uses a barbell and an  fanny lifter. but,regular weights and any type step up box will do. If you use this video with FIRM STRENGTH  you will even better results. I recommend any of the FIRM videos for people who like to do cardio and strength  workouts. FIRM CARDIO gives you both.",1252454400,5,498,4.43956043956044
865672,5,630439604X,"This tape is one of the best they ever made, it has everything you need, including a super tough leg segmaent at the end.

865673,5,630439604X,"I am a 'firm' believer but I don't like ALL the tapes... you have to sift through them to find the ones that fit you.  But I LOVE this one.  It's a great mix of aerobics and body sculpting, and the routines are fun and interesting.  If you've done the Cardio Sculpt with Allie and liked it, you'll like this to. It's a similar mix but a step up, in my opinion, on intensity and fun.  (Funny too, is that this is an older tape and Allie is one of those in the workout 'class'- maybe before she became an instructor?)",1159315200,8,515,4.069306930693069
865674,4,630439604X,"This video definitely deviates from the other Firm videos but I still enjoyed it. I liked that they added some dance into the step moves instead of just plain up and down movement like in some of the others. Other new moves shake up the series and keep it interesting. I found it slightly easier than some of the old videos in terms of exertion, so I'd recommend this to beginners and intermediate exercisers and for advanced exercisers/regular Firm users, it's a great light day workout. I have two minor criticisms: the music and the scenery. The music is not ideal for an exercise soundtrack. And as for the backdrop, I like how The Firm always has the room looking like a studio instead of that cheesy in-home look. But like I said, minor criticisms and no reason to pass on this video.",1131840000,,790,4.531468531468532
865675,5,630439604X,"When I first began using this DVD, firm cardio, I found the instructor uninteresting.  She wasn't extremely enthusiastic and she was monotone when giving instruction.  However, the more I did it, the more I enjoyed it.  It does use alot of weights, but it also combines cardio.  The firm strength DVD is just as much fun, but somehow, the firm cardio I find to be tougher than the firm strenth, but I love them both!!",1066176000,4,417,4.52
865676,5,630439604X,"If you are already in good shape, this tape will help you maintain/get stronger, if you need muscle toning and strengthening, this tape will help you. I did not have much upper body strength before I did this tape and ""Firm Strength"" on a regular basis, but after about two weeks of alternating the two tapes, I noticed I felt and looked stronger in both my upper and lower body areas.  Like all the Firm videos, it is high quality and moves smoothly from one segment to the other.  My favorite exercise on this one is the last thing which is the gluteal exercise while wearing ankle weights.  It is tough, but it really did firm up my butt and other areas.  You can modify it by using no weights at first, (recommended), lighter, than heavier weights as you get stronger.  Good teamed with ""Firm Strength"".  See my review of that.",1059350400,9,831,4.470198675496689

This workout will give you results! You don't have to use the 14 inch step (sadly they don't sell it anymore) but a 12 inch rubbermaod step will work just as good (just use heavier dumbells to compensate). Always the best!

I guess I will have to buy the first tough tape , every one says it is tough : )  the floor work is ok if you use ankle weights , the more positive note is every move is pretty slow so heavy weights would be fine as long as you use good form.",1412035200,2,754,3.654320987654321
