4596625,5,B0057I8GGK,Im writing solely about the 3d. There are so many pop out scenes. The depth is unbelievable. Any thats luke me and collects 3d blu rays ( I have 161 3d blu rays) it is a must have,1377734400,2,179,3.736842105263158
4596626,5,B0057I8GGK,"This hands down is the very top of the 3-D food chain, beautiful inside and out the very best, I have 113 3-D blu-ray titles and this blows them all away, I couldn't find this anywhere except here for 40 bucks i'm not paying that much so I downloaded it with foreign audio to see what the hype was all about, it's fantastic I also have number two almost equally impressive and it's number two on the best 3-D for sure I don't know why this isn't released in the states damn shame I will purchase it the minute it becomes available at a reasonable price",1372032000,2,552,4.216981132075472
4596627,5,B0057I8GGK,"The 3D is very strong. The dept and pop-outs are amazing.
Totally worth the money. Nwave is the King of 3D right now.",1362268800,,117,4.130434782608695
4596628,5,B0057I8GGK,"First, know that I received the 3D Blu-Ray as described.  It is a single blu-ray, NOT a DVD as someone else said.  Both the 3D and 2D versions are on the same blu-ray disc so be aware of this if you are wanting to play it on a DVD player.  Far East Flea Market was my seller and it took just over a week to get the movie from Hong Kong to my home in the US so I highly recommend purchasing it from them.  If you want English, when you start the disc be sure to go into setup and change the audio to English, it deafults to Cantonese.  The English soundtrack is the same as the American version of the movie (which you can't get in 3D) including the songs, so don't be afraid of ordering this version.

While the story itself is just okay, where this movie really shines is the 3D.  There are not a lot of ""quick and coming right at you"" effects but most of the movie has things that will seem in the room with you.  For example, when the turtles are swimming they are almost always swimming outside of the screen.  I don't have kids in my house and not a huge fan of cartoons at my age but if you own a 3D TV this movie is a must have.",1360108800,8,1135,3.921397379912664
4596629,3,B0057I8GGK,"Should be reasonably ok for young kids who understand English or Cantonese or who can read English or Chinese subtitles. This 2009 DVD (not bluray) title is the first of two in this series and it has a 2D disc and a 3D anglyph (red blue paper glasses) disc in Region 3 NTSC. The 3D is a bit strong, so as always for 3D if that bothers you, you may want to sit back further or take a rest or of course you can close one eye. The second title in the series A Turtles Tale (see review) is in full color 3D for electronic glasses viewing.",1358640000,,534,4.0

4596635,5,B0057I8GGK,"Some of the best off the screen 3D out there,the snake that comes off the screen is the best, from my chair when I pause it I can almost touch his nose with my foot thats how far he is off the screen! Lawrence Cheng is one of the best dealers out there he did a fantastic job of getting the DVD shipped so I highly recommend him!! The DVD will work on the LG LED TV in english if you go to set up and set it to english.",1424995200,2,419,3.6666666666666665

4596637,5,B0057I8GGK,"Have been looking for the Hong Kong version for some time. The 3D effects are some of the best demo material you can get, especially chapter 3. There is an American version that was released as ""A Turtles Tale"", but is not nearly as well mastered. This is the disc to get if you can. There is an English language track with well known actors on this version, so don't pass it up just because the packaging is in Chinese. Great experience, I would definitely purchase from this seller again!",1417219200,3,490,4.455555555555556

4596640,5,B0057I8GGK,"Nice story, great 3D and animation. It's just a shame that you have to pay more to get this 3D Chinese version to be able to select English language, but when you do everything works fine.",1388793600,2,188,4.25
8460750,5,B0057I8GGK,Amazing 3D - some great pop-outs - especially the snake and best of all the harpoon coming straight at you. If you are into 3D then you definitely have to add it to your collection. Cute story.  NWAVE are the KINGS of 3D.,1495584000,,221,4.1395348837209305

The seller was awesome too I had it in less than a week. Even though the movie is Korean it works perfect for English (American) just change the language in the settings and you're good to go. The movie was really cute I enjoyed it.",1458777600,,456,3.967391304347826
