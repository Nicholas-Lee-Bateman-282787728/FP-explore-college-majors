7921842,5,B00004S88V,"This tape is excellent. I really appreciate the instructor's frequent tips and reminders about alignment to help prevent injury. She's obviously very experienced and knows her stuff. The workout itself is great--covers the whole body, and you'll feel toned and tightened all over.",1058140800,,280,5.534883720930233
7921843,3,B00004S88V,"I really like this instructor and will look at some of the other videos she has to offer.  But I found that I did not get a real good workout.  She seemed to jump from one exercise to the other without really working the muscles.  For instance, when she worked the arms etc, she only did 5 reps.  Not enough to feel the burn.  It's definitely a beginners workout.  I like her calm voice and soft music in the background.  Fantastic instructor!",1054684800,,443,4.329268292682927
7921844,5,B00004S88V,"A studio style workout in the privacy of your living room! I tried a Pilates class with a friend in North Carolina and wanted something similar that I could do at home.  Clear directions, minimal equipment and space,  very effective movements. If you have tried other flexband tapes, this one  will not disappoint you. Focus is on flexibilty and strength which will  nicely round out your home library of aerobic tapes.",963014400,,419,4.859154929577465
