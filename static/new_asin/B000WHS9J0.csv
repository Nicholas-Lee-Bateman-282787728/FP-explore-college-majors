8223440,1,B000WHS9J0,"The DVD from Stanford University starts out with me wishing that I continued for my PhD, as the presenter was addressing a more lofty audience. Then the presenter lost her focus and the matter of being smarter than I am didn't matter so much.  The presenter went on to readdressed a few forgotten tid bits in the middle of introducing still more concepts that I guess could be classified as a facet of Familial based mood disturbances. Than the presentation became overly edited in an assumed attempt to save the integrity of the material being covered.  At that point I lost interest and began to question why someone felt this was of value to share with persons like me who has limited funds to bone up on smart matters. This release did not flatter the presenter or enlighten me, the viewer,  much beyond how females are affected by the two familial mood dysregulation discussed.  Lastly, the presenter told the audience that she was going to ignore males with such dysregulation issues.  That disappointed me. I never really understood her bias toward males outside she worked primarily with women. But is this really a reason to justify leaving men out of the discussion?",1488844800,,1176,4.801980198019802
