2553573,4,B000F73UI2,"Finally had time to watch this last night, and this didn't disappoint. Had my attention from the get go, as I knew from the beginning that this could be good. A 2004 horror flick from South Korea, this has its scares and twists. A group is invited to a doll museum to be models for the doll master to sculpt. Well, I'm not going to give anything away, but as you know that anytime you're invited to anything in a horror film, it usually means an invitation to hell. But I'll finish with a good advice, if anytime you come across an evil doll, you must poke its eyes out and decapitate it!",1369180800,2,588,4.212389380530974
2553574,5,B000F73UI2,This movie is worth a thousand words from begining to end if your a horror lover then you would understand completely where am coming from truly without adout awesome movie,1368403200,,172,4.766666666666667
2553575,4,B000F73UI2,"The subtitles get choppy as the end. It's only in one sequence that they don't match up, but it's still kind of annoying.",1367884800,,121,4.304347826086956
2553576,5,B000F73UI2,"What's stronger than mere whimsical human love? Love that comes from the Spirit realms!

I love this movie because it depicts aspects of reality that most people today would like to ignore.

I see this story mostly as a love story of a spirit encased in a doll whose love for her human creator entrapped her in this evil human realm. After the doll's creator was murdered, the doll's spirit lingered around and went on a killing spree to entrap and kill all who killed her master. The later victims had no inkling as to the motives of the doll's anger and saw it merely as that, outward anger displayed as symptoms for lost love. This type of spirit can be easily appeased in RL, but most modern folks don't know how to cope with it. Despite some cheesy acting towards the second half of the movie, I felt that the first half of the movie and the last few scenes were particularly poignant and memorable, a very sad tragedy that needs retelling.

Spirit dolls are very easy to create, but if like playing with dolls, make sure you know what you're doing; study first and be very careful what you call forth!

2553577,5,B000F73UI2,"The Doll Master begins in the past in a countryside during the Japanese occupation of Korea, some 70 years ago. A narrator tells us the tale of a doll maker who fell in love with a woman in red. He makes a doll as a gesture of his love. It works and the woman falls in love with him as well. Later in a tragic set of circumstances, the woman is found murdered. All the people blame the doll master. He is eventually arrested and killed by vigilantes in the woods. The doll, not content to be without her maker, sits by his grave for all time, apparently mourning his loss as if alive. Fast-forward to the present, where a group of strangers from the city have arrived at an isolated art museum in the middle of nowhere, with the promise of dolls to be made in their image. Of the group, there is Hae-mi, a sculptor; Tae-seong, a male model looking for work, Yeong-ha, a woman who claims she talks to her doll Damian, with a photographer and a ditzy high school student rounding out the final two. The group is greeted by the museum's curator, who introduces them to the museum's dolls, as well as a doll maker, who happens to be confined to a wheelchair. After Yeong-ha's doll has its head separated from its body, the guest list starts slimming down fast. All the clues point to a mysterious, young woman, Mi-na from the nearby village who happens to be the doll that Hae-Mi once owned as a child.

So i have to say this movie was not what i xpected but that was the beuty of it. I also loved that is not as trajict as other asian horros films",1299542400,9,1544,4.2517006802721085
2553578,1,B000F73UI2,"I don't know if the movie is any good, as I wasn't able to watch it. Or, to be precise, to hear it. The movie soundtrack is DTS only, while Dolby Digital is used for the commentaries only (in Korean, with no subtitles). This should be warned in the product description.",1222387200,,269,4.294117647058823
2553579,3,B000F73UI2,"""The Doll Master,"" I must say has at least one thing going for it: It's not a rehash of so many other Asian Horror films that seem to have proliferated our shores and inundated our video stores. There was a time I would have welcomed this, but it gets to a point that originality is being lost on an overabundance of films which are really not that good. Not that American Horror flicks are something to get all excited over either, however, it would be refreshing to see something genuine once in awhile. Since I have a pretty large Asian film collection, I can understand how some people are getting more and more turned off with many of these types of films. [Asian Horror that is!]

Which brings us to the film in question. Is it a good film? Or at least original? Well, yes and no. The plot of the film is pretty good, and as for the characters, well this is a horror film, therefore I usually don't expect Laurence Olivier or Toshiro Mifune. But is it an interesting film?  Well, there will be those who dislike the film [no matter what] and there will be those who find the film appealing. This film was given to me by a friend who knows of my love for Japanese and other Asian cinema. [Drama, mystery, horror, samurai, etal.] The film, directed by (Yong-ki Jeong) will not win any awards, but it is not a total failure either. However, it is neither creepy, nor suspensefully nuanced. [To me anyway]

The film is predictable and laughable in many areas. Too many to go into. The film starts off very slowly. Several young people are invited to attend a special and creeepy gallery which is filled with dolls: Many of them life-size. These young adults are to be used as models for dolls by a very reclusive doll-maker: Including the films main protagonist, Hae-mi (Yu-mi Kim). However, they find that they are the object of vengeful spirits which inhabit the dolls [Hasn't this been done before?] Anyway, these dolls are pretty mean and do some terrible things to these young adults. Including killing some of them. There is a high gore level [minus one point for me], however some may enjoy this. I think the film could have been very good, if only the acting was a little more convincing. Recommended with caution.",1169942400,6,2224,4.541147132169576
2553584,5,B000F73UI2,"One of the best Korean horrors I have ever seen!
It really keeps you very involved and has a very nice twisted ending :)
Perfect for anyone who loves dolls!!!",1458518400,2,158,4.3

2553587,3,B000F73UI2,I've seen better Asian horror flicks. But this one was fun. Can't really say anything more about it.,1446076800,,100,4.611111111111111

2553590,3,B000F73UI2,"An interesting horror film - and I understand it interested Dario Argento so that the famed Italian horror director
expressed an interest in remaking it.  Unfortunately this hasn't happened. I would have given it a four star rating
were in not for some plot elements that disappointed me.",1443139200,2,288,5.0
2553591,4,B000F73UI2,"I really like this movie. It's definitely Asian horror, but I feel that there are fewer psychological twists and turns than in many Korean films. As a result, it's a great popcorn flick with a nice, creepy atmosphere. If you collect or are interested in Asian Ball Jointed Dolls, you'll also enjoy all the Customhouse company dolls featured in the film. I feel the leads did a good job drawing you into the story, and most of the cast was quite likeable. I loved the atmosphere of the doll museum, and would love to visit! There are also some surprisingly emotional moments in the film. Overall, I really recommend to anyone who likes the genre in general. This is a fun film. Be aware that the subtitles in the last 5-10 minutes (only two or three sentences, really) display far in advance of when the lines are actually spoken. It's fairly obvious where they were meant to go, though, so it's not too hard to follow.",1442361600,7,918,4.536144578313253

2553604,2,B000F73UI2,"I really liked this movie after watching it on Prime.  On Prime, the English subtitles disappear near the climatic ending.  I got the DVD in the hope it would have those subtitles.  Sadly, it does not have them.  It is obvious that what is being said is important to the plot, but there are still no subtitles.  Really, really disappointed that the DVD has the same flaw.  I do not plan to buy another DVD from this seller.",1440547200,4,423,4.358974358974359

2553607,5,B000F73UI2,Loved it! Like the idea that even a possessed doll can also have memories from the doll itself.,1433030400,,95,4.333333333333333
2553608,4,B000F73UI2,"It was a little slow in some places--and I got frustrated with the captioning--which blended in with the beginning credits and disappeared at the very end.  Then there came a point where a lot of information was thrown at you at once, and that was hard to keep track of. Otherwise, I found it to be a good movie.",1423872000,,312,4.288135593220339
2553609,3,B000F73UI2,"I really liked the movie until about 10 minutes toward the end.  That's when the subtitles became non-existent.  From other comments, I've gathered that this problem is not confined to just me.  Any clarification on the plot or any heartfelt sentiments were lost in the non-subtitled section, which left me feeling very unsatisfied.",1422057600,,332,5.226415094339623
2553610,3,B000F73UI2,"I would have given this movie a 5 star, but the subtitle disappeared just before the movie ended. Making the movie un-understandable during the movie's climax. Please fix.",1420934400,,171,5.142857142857143
2553611,1,B000F73UI2,"The dolls were creepy and the set-up for the story was interesting, but the ending completely unravelled as the movie got more and more supernatural and the main character, Hae-mi, just kept getting shallower and shallower.  It didn't help that the English subtitles stopped 5 minutes before credits rolled.",1420156800,,307,5.26530612244898

2553613,3,B000F73UI2,"I wasn't particularly impressed with the protagonist or the action sequences, but I enjoyed the eerie mansion setting with all those amazing and interesting dolls. A couple of the supporting characters really stand out too. All in all this is fine for when you're looking for a random horror movie and it doesn't have to be amazingly well written or acted.",1417824000,,356,4.852459016393443
2553614,1,B000F73UI2,"Awful, awful movie!  I saw some decent reviews online for The Doll Master but it turned out to be a derivative, poorly made, poorly acted and poorly directed ""horror"" movie devoid of scary moments.  If this was an American film my guess is that it would have went straight to DVD.",1417219200,,280,4.470588235294118

2553616,5,B000F73UI2,"The movie really sets up the characters really well and it's not all blood and gore. In fact, there isn't any gore and little blood. It's really a suspense movie and I love it even more because the gore-y movies are too redundant. Anyway, I love that there was a twist and I love Mina. I felt so sorry for her because she's waited all this time to meet Hae-Min (?) and when she does, she's rejected. She did everything to make her happy but Hae-Min became scared of her. I feel so bad for her, even though she's not exactly human T_T",1412726400,,533,4.184466019417476
2553617,3,B000F73UI2,"Very odd movie but managed to keep my attention. The beginning of the movie was not bad, it was pretty good in fact with some amusing parts. The characters all had their quirks, more some than others. Sadly, later on in the movie, it degenerated into stupidity in my opinion. Also, the subtitles inexplicably disappeared in the last several minutes of the movie but I still, could figure it out.

I would still recommend this to horror fans, particularly those who are drawn to foreign horror and strange movies in general.",1407283200,,523,4.747252747252747
2553618,4,B000F73UI2,"Another really good movie from Asian Crush.  Full of suspense and jump in your seat type stuff.  Reminded me a little of Puppet Master, but the story line in this one was pretty good and there was not as much gore.  There was stuff to give you nightmares, it certainly was not blood free, but it was done well.  I would not recommend it to little kids though, it probably would give them the night terrors and they wouldn't look at their dollies is quite the same light!",1404432000,,470,4.306818181818182
2553619,3,B000F73UI2,"Nice horror movie flare. I love this movie, but the subtitles are horrid near the end of the movie. Subtitles are good from the begin, but near the end they start to get choppy then completely disappear.",1402358400,5,203,4.513513513513513

2553621,3,B000F73UI2,"I didn't disliked this movie (though I would be hard pressed to make a 2nd viewing) but I rated it a 3 because it's pretty average fare for someone looking to pass the time. It has all the standard Asian horror elements so if you don't mind repetitiveness and enjoy a bit of long dark hair with your horror then you'll enjoy this. If you absolutely have to watch this then do yourself a favor and don't watch it on Prime because you might be disappointed by the end (Buy the DVD or check until Netflix has it available). I'm still surprised how poor Amazon prime is when it comes on international films. The subtitles in this movie disappeared about 15 mins towards the end of the film. I've had intermittent problems with subtitles blinking out for mins at a time on movies or just plain being wrong but no matter how many times I report it, Amazon just doesn't care enough to fix it.",1391731200,7,885,4.36969696969697

2553623,1,B000F73UI2,Seven minutes from the end the subtitles stop. I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. There are two problems with the story. The first is that there is more than one story taking place and the explanation of each is left to the end.
