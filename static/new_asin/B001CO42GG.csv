8288315,1,B001CO42GG,its really terrible that this guy is so happy that disasters happen,1523318400,,67,4.666666666666667
8288316,1,B001CO42GG,I could not complete these as George is VERY annoying! He seems to think he is the reason we want to watch these interestingly titled programs but much to my and other people's disappointment the programs focus only on George. He seems to think he is an entertaining stand up comedian! He is not! It would be nice if the producers can get rid of George and get some history and scientific facts in these programs. They would be worth the time it takes to watch them.,1520121600,,466,4.367816091954023
8288317,4,B001CO42GG,"I originally put this on just to have something going as background noise while I worked, but I actually became a fan!  I think this show is well made and interesting.  I don't think it's as educational/fact driven as some might want but it makes up for that in charm & personality.  It's neat to see what weather chasers do on the off time.  I will be watching all episodes.",1508112000,,375,4.314285714285714
8288318,1,B001CO42GG,"How can you make devastating storms boring? by focusing on ME, ME, ME.",1479081600,2,70,4.461538461538462
8288319,1,B001CO42GG,"If you enjoy watching a amateur personal diary of an adrenalin junkie putting himself in harms way, then you might enjoy these DVDs.  The footage is subpar, to be polite, and is not really about the planet, but about the narrators thoughts and feelings as he experience dangerous events.  These DVDs contains almost no science and have minimal value even as entertainment.",1387584000,3,372,4.983870967741935
8288320,1,B001CO42GG,"A very pitiful attempt of a fasinating subject but it is more like a home movie of ""How I spent my summer vacation.""  Way too much useless footage of the narrator doing mundane things.  I bought this cheap and got what I paid for. Would be zero stars if possible.",1295049600,6,263,4.24
8288321,3,B001CO42GG,"The main problem with this series is that although the narrator chooses some very interesting places to go, most of the time the camera is on the narrator, not on the interesting places.  The occassional great shot of storm clouds or lightning or a literally boiling hot lake are separated by many minutes of footage of the narrator packing his bags or looking at his computer or driving his car with his hands off the steering wheel while he turns around and looks at the camera.

And as another reviewer noted, there's very little real scientific content in here.

The sound levels are bungled, so you'll probably find yourself changing the volume setting frequently, especially if you are trying not to disturb your roommates or neighbors.

There are many misleading things about this DVD.  The DVD packaging says that it was shot in ""high definition"".  But that's essentially fraud because this is a standard resolution DVD, not Blu-Ray or some other high-def format, so all you will see is standard resolution, no matter what kind of cameras were used in the original filming.

The series name, ""Angry Planet"", is suspiciously similar to the name of a better series, ""Savage Planet"", and is probably an attempt to trick potential buyers who don't remember the exact name of the better series.

I purchased this series very cheaply, and I enjoyed it, so I'm giving it 3 stars (barely).  But there are much better nature DVDs (""Savage Planet"", ""Planet Earth"", etc.), so unless you've got more time and money than you know what to do with, you would be better off buying another series.",1271203200,10,1588,4.830258302583026
8288322,2,B001CO42GG,"I purchased this set hoping that there would be some educational information conveyed in each episode about the places the show visits.  I was sorely disappointed.  The sites are phenomenal, but the shows are mostly about someone trying to pull off a dangerous stunt.  The stunts aren't to learn anything new about the sites, or to do research.  Very little history or science is conveyed.

I personally think that each episode could be better done in about 10 minutes.  There is way too much duplicated footage and the drama shots are overdone.  However, if you like other shows about stuntwork, you may like this one.  At least the main character is concerned with safety and some conservation.",1266019200,4,696,4.888888888888889
8288323,5,B001CO42GG,"But who am I to say, I can be seen in a couple of these episodes as I vacation with George each spring. After all, what use is a vacation without a near death experience or three?

These shows are very well done, and alot of fun to watch. I got to see most of them this year while George was driving us to our doom in central Kansas. Having seen the pictures, I can't wait to start seeing season 2.",1218672000,2,398,3.9135802469135803
