8204985,5,B000SAMC08,"After two years of digging around online through websites and webpages, I have finally concluded the VHS set perfect collection is the only true complete version.  With all the fogged scenes intact.  Another issue I have is why so many people who have seen this act so ashamed to have seen it.  Grow up!  It's not like these people found it by accident.  This film has everything from drama, romance, to an apocalyptic demon destroying the world.  I look upon this as I would look upon it as a lover of low budget horror films.  It's been censored.  It's been chopped up.  It's been banned, twice!  What's even worse is the price tag on these.  I'm glad I caught this VHS set from a private seller only asking 20 bucks for it two years ago.  Now it's worth $250.  The Perfect DVD is worth $160, and ebay has the complete Urotsukidoji box set for $400.  Anyone who thinks anyone's gonna spend that much money are idiots.  As much as I don't want to wear out the tapes too quickly, I am now watching this a third time.  It's that good.  The story and the characters and very strongly designed, and with the recent new release of New Saga, there might be hope for the original series, NOT THE FEATURE LENGTH MOVIE VERSIONS, to finally get a true collector's release.",1345420800,3,1263,4.445414847161572

-THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS

For 3,000 years, humankind has dominated the world unchallenged...but that time is coming to an end. According to legend, every 3,000 years the three realms of demons, humans, and man-beasts are united by the revival of a being more powerful than them all--and the coming of this Overfiend means chaos and destruction!

The saga Legend Of The Overfiend begins here. Determined to find the Overfiend and prevent the cataclysm, demons scour the human world for signs of his coming. Two such creatures, AMANO JYAKU and his sister MECUMI have tracked the Overfiend to an unlikely place, Myojin University in Japan. Here, they believe, they will find a human whose destiny it is to mutate into the Overfiend.

But they are not alone in their search; other, more sinister demons are intent'on beating them to the prize. Two college students, TATSUO NAGUMO and AKEMIITO are unwittingly drawn into the hunt...and after a night of horrific revelations, their lives will be forever changed!

Emerging from the little-known, yet powerful genre of Japanese erotic horror, Legend Of The Overfiend is a tour de force of startling images that redefines the limits of animated entertainment. Its intense blend of supernatural battles, sexual content, and intricate design work has made it one of the most controversial animated films in recent memory. Watch it tonight--if you dare!
