8102959,3,B000DWN0CU,"Good info on the half-tracked vehicles and armored cars of 1934 to 1944 German army.

Not what one sees from U.S.A.-produced documentaries. Some of those vehicles sure look like what the U.S.A. produced later.",1369526400,,209,5.147058823529412
8102960,4,B000DWN0CU,"This DVD contains about an hour of footage almost entirely from German WWII newsreals. Although made for propaganda purposes the footage itself is quite good at illustrating the vehicles covered in operation. The DVD includes footage on all Nazi era armored cars (both wheeled and tracked), tracked personal carriers (though not of non-tracked vehicles such as trucks, motorcycles and jeep-like vehicles), tracked prime movers and kettengrads (very light tracked vehicles). The footage does an excellent job at showing these vehicles in operation. The footage of the kettengrad, for example, shows how small, maneuverable and useful it was at carrying items around (footage shows it carrying light guns and traversing wide variety of tough terain). In addition to the video footage, the DVD is quite informative with respect to all the vehicles covered. Information was provided, by a monotone English voice, on historical development of vehicles, uses, weaknesses and strengths and many times how many were even built. Very informative. The only real weakness of the DVD is its lack of coverage of non-tracked vehicles such as trucks, motorcylces and jeep-like vehicles such as the kubelwagen and its amphibious brother the schwimwagen.",1263081600,,1237,5.481675392670157
8102961,5,B000DWN0CU,"This is an excellent source on WWII German armor. It gives general information on the scouting cars as well on the support vehicles.  Some nice photos and shorts on the eight wheelers.  If you like to model German armor this video, as well others in the series, would be one of your best DVD amor references.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stug-III-IV-Assault-Guns/dp/B000EQ5UCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stug III & IV - Assault Guns</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panzer-I-II-Light-Tanks/dp/B000B9E2JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panzer I & II: Light Tanks</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiger-Heavy-Tank-Panzer-VI/dp/B000EQ5UC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiger: Heavy Tank Panzer VI</a>.",1249862400,2,817,9.2
8102962,5,B000DWN0CU,"This series was originally marketed under another name but the videos themselves are the same. The use of archival combat footage is excellent. The coverage of all aspects of these vehicles is extensive. ALL armored cars and half-tracks are covered in this video, not just the better-known ones. Good coverage of variants to the standard models.

This video covers all WWII German armored cars from early pre-war models phased out after the shock of war showed them to be insufficient for the task right through the 50mm-armed Puma. Major variants such as radio cars and support vehicles mounting heavy weapons were covered. One notices the trend as the war progresses to up-gun every vehicle capable of carrying a heavier weapon. Armored cars begin with a single machine gun, move to 20mm cannon, 75mm howitzers, even 50mm and 75mm antitank guns.

It covers all half-track models. Coverage of armored APC models is very good showing changes to the basic model including anti-tank, support and engineer models. Unarmored half-tracks are also given good coverage, showing the seven(!) sizes of half-tracks used by the Wehrmacht. Most were used as prime-movers for artillery or flak, but some were designed as recovery vehicles for damaged or broken down Panzers. It also shows the field-expedient half-tracks such as the ""mule"" used for hauling loads in snow and mud of the Russian landscape as well as fully-tracked RSO's used for hauling loads.

While watching this video, one is impressed by the German tendency to design purpose-built vehicles that in most cases were the perfect solution to the military problem. Each of the vehicles highlighted on this video seems so much more advanced and specialized than their allied counterparts.

This video uses excellent archival footage and some stills to show the plethora of German armored cars and half-tracks. This is an excellent video which covers the subject in an exemplary fashion. WWII armor and military enthusiasts will enjoy every moment of this DVD.",1226275200,3,2010,5.1753846153846155
8102963,5,B000DWN0CU,"If you are interested in German military vehicles from WWII (scale modellers, military history buffs, etc) then this DVD is a great one to add to your collection. I've got 6 or 7 DVD's from this series and this is one of the very best. It's chocked full of info and has lots of great video footage of the subject vehicles in action. It's an incredible value (especially at this price). It covers a good variety of German military vehicles both early and late war production. Mostly Armored cars and Half Tracks as the subtitle indicates. Now some of the video footage isn't the best quality but it's as you would expect from combat/newsreel footage from the 30's and 40's. If you are interested in this subject I would highly recommend buying this DVD. It's one thing to look at these vehicles as pictures and stats in a book but it's another story entirely when you get to see them being driven around in use as they were during the war. I watch a good number of these videos and in my opinion this one is first rate.",1190419200,9,1018,4.420212765957447
