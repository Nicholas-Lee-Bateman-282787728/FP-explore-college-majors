5087855,3,B007I1TGR2,"Queens blade is fan service meet mortal combat. The animation is excellent, tho the story does tend to drag. If you're looking to purchase this series, beware of the price. Amazons price is reasonable, but the used copies are way over priced. Its best to avoid these profiteers.anything over 30 dollars U.S. is beyond what this series is worth.",1363996800,5,344,4.8474576271186445
5087856,3,B007I1TGR2,A fairly epic fighting series with an overly serious tone that didn't quite live up to all the hype this series has generated.  There are quite a few riveting moments but at times the protaganists journey from novice to ultimate fighter does feel a bit tedious.,1359072000,2,261,4.673913043478261
5087857,5,B007I1TGR2,"I love this series and I was very excited when I received it. Everything from the beginning of the DVD to the final battle was great! THe ecchi scenes spoke for themselves and did perfectly for me. In my opinion, anyone who loves action and ecchi should totally buy this DVD.",1357776000,,275,4.411764705882353
5087868,4,B007I1TGR2,"Pretty good anime.  The animation is excellent and the story is pretty good.  It is a bit tedious in the early episodes, but gets better once the characters are all in play and the story gets going.  I will be getting more in this series.",1423353600,,238,4.2444444444444445

5087873,5,B007I1TGR2,"While the first Queen's Blade season introduced all the characters in the series hence making more fanservice scenes than this season in particular where it has more fighting scenes and takes itself a little more seriously.

After the end of the first season, the tournament arc finally begins and Nanael the angel who recaps all the fighters is then forced to join the tournament because of how she failed her test of spilling the Holy Milk very early on (like that was her fault anyway when the Head Angel knows Nanael is clumsy). The tournament is set up differently in contrast to the original material but the end result will still be the same.

There are a lot of good battles in this season with a few exceptions (the Cattleya versus Airi battle angered me only because Cattleya lost the will to fight when she found out that Aldra had turned her husband to stone and she could keep going to save her husband instead of breaking down and letting herself be turned to stone forcing Airi to take care of her son and then things go bad for Airi as a result). You know a battle is good is coming when they decide to play Kuiinzubureido Taikai no Teema B that sounds like it came out of Fire Emblem OST (you can find that on Youtube).

Beside the battle mentioned above, another thing that annoys me is how because Leina is the protagonist she will always win her battles. It's just a given that she's going to be the one to fight Aldra at the end, but to see what the other characters have to go through is just sad especially since their reason to be in the tournament is more important than Leina. Like yeah Leina wants to prove herself but you have Tomoe who is fighting to save her country or Nowa who is fighting to be acknowledged by the elves and Ymir who needs to enter the tournament so she can help prosper the dwarves. Leina honestly comes off as lame in comparison to the other girls where you're on the edge of your seat on who is going to win but with her its like ""Okay protagonist. Move on."" I guess I'm still angry with how her battle with Tomoe turned out and after all that Tomoe has struggled and suffered in this season (since she's hit with a lot of bad things).

After this season you have the OVA which is what happens after the tournament that helps tie the story up but for a series finale, this is very good because unlike the original source, the anime did a better job tying loose ends with all the characters especially Cattleya who got what she wanted from the tournament where in the original source, she didn't and just disappears after the tournament never to be heard from again and its kind of depressing given what happened to her in the Vanquished Queen novel. So overall I give it a 90/100 because this was generally my favorite season of Queen's Blade (especially with what we got with Rebellion...)",1400198400,4,2842,4.4282982791587
5087874,5,B007I1TGR2,It is a very entertaining series which is why I bought it! It's funny and soothing for those complexing days.,1394841600,,109,4.5
5087875,5,B007I1TGR2,"This series is great and I'm happy to see that it arrived in good condition. Found no problems with the discs at all. If your looking for anime that falls into the action fantasy genre then you won't be disappointed with queen's blade season 2. A series that has a great cast, good character development and a well driven story will be hard to pass up.",1388534400,,352,4.348484848484849

5087877,5,B007I1TGR2,"My purchase was delivered in a timely manner and no problems with shipping or damage. I really do love this series, its a little overly fan-serviced; but hey you know what you're getting into. If you like series such as Sekirei, Mouse, or Valkerie, you are going to want to add this to your collection.",1373241600,3,302,4.509090909090909

8517150,4,B007I1TGR2,"This series in my opinion is pretty underrated. I say this because the way it is marketed is the possible reason why this show hasn't caught on as say Sekirei or Freesing in terms of popularity or fanbase. The way it was advertised made this look like it was just showing actions scenes that were recorded from a fantasy hentai and even the figures look like it.

This show is anything BUT hentai.

This show is your basic fighting tournament anime with the exception being that cloths get torn or ruined legitlly and every contestant are women and only women as the person who wins becomes a queen.

Not so original in it's plot, but the twists and small touches make this seem like this is unique. The characters actually have some personality and could actually be relatable depending on your point of view and the humor is pretty funny.

Now like I said, this is not hentai. Anybody thinking they will be seeing a mans noodle or even a womans taco is gonna have to look elsewhere. This is a pretty good show, and if you can handle the cringe worthy amount of fanservice, it is worth a buy.",1455926400,2,1093,4.45

8517153,4,B007I1TGR2,"This was a very good show. The animation was well done and the characters were fun enough to continue to watch, they were also sexy and who doesn't enjoy chic and blades. There is a magical kind of sexiness to it. The fight scenes were well animated. The story good so I really have no complaints about this one.",1444176000,,312,4.305084745762712
8517154,5,B007I1TGR2,So far it's as good as the 1st set of queens blade complete series (aka QB: Exiled Virgin). But I don't like the intro music as much as I liked it in the Exiled Virgin. They still turn up with the juicy bits -w-.,1438732800,,212,3.840909090909091

8517157,4,B007I1TGR2,"The second part of the series or series 2 however you want to look at it. This is where the fight to be Queen commences. This part seems to drag a bit.  As usual fan service from the get go. There was  an intense moment in the Queens chamber when the swords blacksmith woman with the hideously huge boobs finds her long lost husband encased in crystal and gets encased in crystal next to him, right in front of her son Lana. (work of the evil Eye) I don't mind the fan service and find it funny how they use any excuse they can come up with for the girls to lose their clothes. Although when the characters are talking and we are looking up their asses it does get bothersome. Also, wait till you figure out what the Holy Milk really is. Gross. This series combines slice and dice anime think Zena Warrior Princess series, ( no real slicing or dicing ever really happens in this series just clothes and armor flying off) and fan service. Being a straight woman this is a combination I can actually tolerate to watch (not a fan of fan service deviant sex anime).",1429574400,,1061,4.3
8517158,5,B007I1TGR2,Great follow up to the exiled virgin. More intense story line with a great focus on the characters. I actually found myself sobbing through some of the intensely emotional fight scenes.,1425600000,,185,5.0
