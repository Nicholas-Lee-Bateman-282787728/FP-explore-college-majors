8730465,2,B014E1TNJ4,"This is a Greek film dubbed haphazardly in English. Otto, for instance had a distinct Jersey accent. Dragar, made to look like the illegitimate son of Tor Johnson, has been a slave for four years and still thinks about his wife. He has been a gladiator fighter. When he is bought by the beautiful Valeria, daughter of a General of the Empire, he is forced to take a bath. He suddenly revolts, takes her as a hostage and is hunted on his return to his homeland.

The setting is similar to ancient Rome with the action taking place in a northern Europe outpost. Otto has a gun to create what would be an anachronism if it wasn't on a planet with three moons. Note the two non-red moons have identical markings, their size is just different. We get the expected Stockholm syndrome as Dragar saves his hostage from a would be rapist, although I am not sure how he got there so fast. PLOT SPECIFIC POINT. You see he did the Butch and Sundance escape, except there was no water. He dislocated his shoulder which he popped back in, good as new, and he was able to rescue aforesaid girl in a matter of moments after dropping off a cliff from her location.

In one tracking scene, the tracker picks up the snow and smells it. What was that about? Now with a name like Dragonphoenix,  I would have expected a dragon to arise out of the ashes of another dragon...you know like that red dragon on the front cover flying in the sky. Apparently the DVD cover designer had the same thought. But that was not the case. Instead we get a creature in a large rubber head. The mouth moved a little, but the red eyes looked extremely fake (see reverse cover of DVD). It was laughable.

The ""Behind the Scenes"" is subtitled during the moments that they speak. We see them doing a lot of choreography, but they still had to jerk the camera around during sword scenes to create excitement.

The title of the film with a subtitle would indicate there was a plan for a series of these films, but as of yet, nothing seems to be in the works. Thanos Kermitsis who wrote, produced,directed and was a camera man in this film also had a major role. Dragar, played by Yannis Rubus Rubulias grunted out lines, making an occasional Jesse Ventura ""he was a wimp"" speech also helped write, produce and acted as the storyboard artist and set dresser.

Considering the scope and budget, one might heap praise onto the film. Truthfully as entertainment, it ranks only slightly higher than a Rene Perez film. Makes me pine for a  SCORPION KING 4 instead.
