8548931,5,B00AA4M1TO,"I am very happy with this purchase of Reel Rock 7 its a fantastic video of some of the best rock climbing in the world for the year. Sharma and Company are simply amazing in the various films.

 The add on bonus of Luxury Liner is a great documentary movie about the history of one of America's most famous first accents that of Luxery Liner or often known as Super Crack. Its not your normal climbing video but its a very solid documentary with fantastic footage if you want to see a bit of an older age before Spring Loaded Cams made tall Vertical cracks so easy to place gear in.",1370736000,,582,4.2342342342342345

8548933,4,B00AA4M1TO,The video was well worth it.  The footage was fantastic and the in depth profiles of each climber made you understand the intensity of the sport all the more.  It covers multiple facets of climbing not just a single approach.  There is some course language that detracts from the value but I wasn't surprised to hear it.  A must watch for any climber and non-climber alike. Expect to be impressed by what the human body can achieve. WOW,1366934400,,436,4.551282051282051
8548934,4,B00AA4M1TO,"Love reel rock 7! Great footage, nice commentary, great climbers. Rocky mtn highball is not my favorite, annoying music all the way through. Mainly I don't enjoy watching bouldering that much.",1361664000,,192,5.225806451612903
8548935,5,B00AA4M1TO,"I had the pleasure (and luck) of getting the last ticket to see this in theaters when it came to Boston. This DVD is worth the price tag alone just to keep professional climbers at it. Plus, being able to see great segments such as the wide boys and Honnold working the triple in Yosemite is truly priceless. Make sure to buy this, but also get some chalk ready cause your hands will start sweating almost immediately.",1358812800,4,418,4.441558441558442
