8324566,5,6304841647,"I was particularly impressed with the variety of animals in this video.  Most of the animals shown are not found in any other program I have seen.  Some of the animals were only discovered recently.  A peacock in this film was only known from a feather in a museum until filmed for this program.  I loved the entire tape.  It is one I plan on watching many times.  It is sad that this area is being destroyed by poaching to supply the ""Bush Meat"" trade.  This is a program that should be owned by everyone who loves african wildlife.  It is truely spectacular.  Trust me on this one.",1011139200,,583,4.324074074074074
