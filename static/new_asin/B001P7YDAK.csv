3741310,5,B001P7YDAK,I love everything about nature and animals.  These dvd's are very interesting and informative as well as entertaining.  Very well done.,1363737600,,135,5.380952380952381
3741311,3,B001P7YDAK,"It was disappointing to find so little information about the things seen in these dvds. Birds were never identified, even when the camera focused on them. The blue whale one was much too repetitive - with good editing, it would have been a very interesting 30 minutes. Same for 'Relentless Enemies'. That one made a great point of showing a young lion up a tree and in danger from strange lions - but never said what the outcome was. We had hoped these would be good teaching tools, but there isn't much here except superb photography.

3741314,1,B001P7YDAK,"If you are looking for about 10 minutes of actual valuable content in every DVD (and I am being generous with 10 minutes) this is the video for you. There is very little useful information or nature content, most of the content of each DVD is very repetitive. Super disappointed. Waste of time and money.",1293926400,5,304,4.545454545454546
3741315,5,B001P7YDAK,"Thank you so much for this DVD set. It was a gift for my niece in Florida. She loved it. I first looked for a gift on the Nat Geo site but ultimately I found you and the same DVD set for MUCH less. It arrived almost too quickly. I was aiming for her birthday and it arrived a few days before, but I'm not complaining. The only thing better than a birthday present is an early birthday present.",1291161600,,393,3.9873417721518987

3741317,5,B001P7YDAK,I ordered this collection for my daughter. She is an avid fan of National Geographic & loves these DVD's. The views are fantastic. Just what you would expect from National Geographic but at an Amazon price.,1262044800,17,206,4.75
3741318,5,B001P7YDAK,"My father is fascinated with animals.  You can never go wrong with these DVDs.  The funny thing about this, is that even though his 5 children (me and my 4 brothers) don't share the same enthusiam... We enjoyed watching the Nature DVDs.  Much more interesting, narrative was information but not borring, and kinda exciting to learn something new about an animal.  I highly recommend this item, especially from the seller i bought it from.  Thank You.",1254528000,26,450,4.868421052631579

3741341,5,B001P7YDAK,"Fantastic video!  You will not be disappointed! Great cinematography! Makes you feel like you are out there with the naturalists and scientists and biologist who are doing the research! I love to watch these and have learned so much from them. My 4-year old son loves them to. Very appropriate for children, although there could be a little animal violence here and there but it is not the intense type that makes you want to turn the screen off while your kid is watching. It's just things like a bear tearing a salmon fish apart. But that is nature. Still, it really is a great set of films and a great price!  Enjoy!",1409097600,2,619,4.469026548672566

3741343,5,B001P7YDAK,"Even though it said there were 10 discs, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised by this when I opened it up and kept unfolding the box to reveal video after video - I think because when it comes it doesn't look like there are 10 discs, but there are.  I think they are interesting, relaxing, and there are no commercials which is the best! I ended up falling asleep to one of them (in a good way) so when we went back to restart it, we had to do the ""scene selection"" which was a little difficult to decipher 2 days later.  Each scene selection has a title but when watching it there are no said title. I did find it hard to pick one lion scene from the other so I think we may have skipped a few scenes.  Overall, it is a great collection and good value I think.",1394064000,3,760,4.053333333333334
3741344,4,B001P7YDAK,"I bought this video set for the whole family as we are all fans of nature, it is close to watching the BBC series, the stories of each family dynamic are shorter but still interesting. I recommend these videos to anyone who just wants to watch how nature evolves and works.",1391990400,3,273,4.372549019607843

3741346,5,B001P7YDAK,"These discs contains a wealth of information that is very informative, interesting and objective. I found al documentaries worth my time, but I specially enjoyed the one on dolphins; these intelligent animals are presented with both bright and dark side and it fascinates me how complex behavior is exposed in the mamal brain.",1372118400,5,326,5.169811320754717

3741348,5,B001P7YDAK,"Very well photo-documented. Animal behavior is captured in real life and death
sequences. Every time you watch this series you will learn something new. It is
one of the best nature series I have in my collection and well worth the money.
This would make an excellent gift for anyone interested in wide life.",1364428800,8,308,4.722222222222222
8332386,5,B001P7YDAK,The best Nat Geo purchase I ever made! And I've purchased a lot of Nat Geo dvds. The price is totally worth it!

8332389,4,B001P7YDAK,Beautiful videos! My grandson is an animal and nature lover he is really enjoying the videos. There was only one issue... it stated that there was a video on hippos which my grandson was really looking forward to but there was no such video included. Other than that I think it's a beautiful set for good price.,1503705600,,311,4.473684210526316

8332392,5,B001P7YDAK,The National Geographic nature shows are amazing. They go into so much more depth and detail than any other nature show I have seen. With longer episodes and no commercials they are great. I highly recommend these shows for yourself.,1431734400,,233,4.85

8332394,5,B001P7YDAK,These DVDs are fascinating! I love seeing the footage they catch and learning about how these animals care for their young. The only thing I would potentially change is that they throw in little pieces about how threatened all these animals' habitats are. I don't care much for the political aspect of the DVDs but the nature part is incredible.,1428278400,,345,4.766666666666667
