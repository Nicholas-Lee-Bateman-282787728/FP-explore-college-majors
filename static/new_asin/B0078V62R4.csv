8512404,1,B0078V62R4,"Yes ""Where's That Fire"" was a lost film until discovered by the BBC in 1975. Still there is no excuse for such a horrible transfer. It appears that a 35mm print was the source material used, and the contrast is quite good. It's the transfer that is horrible. Heavy use of DVNR that makes the film unwatchable. You actually get a headache form viewing this DVD. Stay away!!",1335312000,2,372,4.485294117647059
