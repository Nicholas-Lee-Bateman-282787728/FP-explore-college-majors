5784773,3,B00D9EJFQY,"It's O.K. but I found that the series is misrepresented. I bought the series because it was supposed to be about a Coast Guard officer in San Francisco. I've only watched two episodes so far, the first one was filmed in San Diego and the second in San Francisco. It has nothing to do with the Coast Guard, Harbor Command is the name of the civilian police force on the water. Very disappointing. Had I known, I would not have purchased it.",1382572800,3,439,4.365853658536586
5784774,5,B00D9EJFQY,I purchased this item for my husband.  He loves it and I enjoy watching the DVD.We watch about two shows four times a week so that it will last longer.,1381881600,6,151,4.033333333333333
5784775,5,B00D9EJFQY,"I concur with everything that the previous reviewer writes - this was an excellent series, largely due to the strikingly atmospheric location photography - a marvellous snapshot of the times, with granite-jawed Wendell Corey aptly cast as the unsmiling, no-nonsense lead. Timeless have already put us greatly in their debt with a whole series of archival products, but this must be one of the rarest titles that they have decided to bring out, so my advice is to place an order without delay - you will not be disappointed with this fascinating look at longshore life from 55 years ago.",1376784000,26,586,4.87

5784787,4,B00D9EJFQY,"At times poorly acted and scripted, this vintage program succeeds because of its San Francisco setting, an usual premise, and at times accidental charm. Wendell Corey suffices. It is what is is, and is recommended to those who enjoy vintage television shows (especially cop shows) and familiar character actors and guest stars (Leonard Nimoy).",1432598400,2,343,5.37037037037037
5784788,4,B00D9EJFQY,"I really enjoyed watching this series. It is somewhat dated now, but if you view it keeping in mind the time context, it was quite enjoyable. The production was good. It was in black and white but I expected that. The acting was well done.",1430697600,,239,4.333333333333333
5784789,5,B00D9EJFQY,Great detective series of the 1950s. Pity there weren't more series.,1429228800,,68,5.2727272727272725
5784790,4,B00D9EJFQY,"Bought this series for my family as a Christmas gift. We have enjoyed them very much. Fun to watch main character with a sense of humor behind the tough-guy facade. Interesting to see their ""shoot first and ask questions later"" way of handling the bad guys!",1428364800,,257,4.608695652173913

5784794,5,B00D9EJFQY,"I've really been enjoying watching the episodes of this old series. The stories aren't all that different from those of today - a law enforcement agency dealing with drugs, larceny, swindling, and murder. But unlike today all they have to deal with that is grit & determination. For me old shows like these are windows looking back in time. I get a kick at seeing the old (but new then) cars and buildings. Times were a bit different back then, but surprisingly the actions of the people were very similar to today.

The audio/video quality of these episodes are pretty good - given what I imagine was the source material. I was surprised how good the audio was since a lot of this show takes place outdoors and often on the water. I'm very happy with my purchase.",1422662400,,764,4.536231884057971
5784795,5,B00D9EJFQY,I am a fan of old TV series from this ear and loved this one. Just finished watching all 39 episodes and plan to watch it all over again. This show was filmed just before I was born. The quality of the transfers was excellent. Too bad it didn't last longer. Can anyone tell me where the World Trade Center building that is depicted in this series was actually located? Love the old shots of SFO.,1421798400,,395,4.2105263157894735
5784806,5,B00D9EJFQY,"Love this series.  The stories are interesting, acting good quality and outdoor filming well done.  A good buy;

5784810,3,B00D9EJFQY,"It's easy to see why this was only on for a year.  Most of the episodes are relatively slow paced by today's standards and most likely by the 50's standards.  I will admit the stories got better as time went on.  A narrator opens the stories and continues through much of the episodes and if I didn't know better, I believe the narrator is the same person that did the old US Navy Training Films I watching during my time in the Navy.  Wendell Corey actually does a great job in his role.  A surprise guest appearance by a twenty-something Leonard Nimoy along with Brian Keith, Peter Marshall and Edmond O'Brien top out the guest appearances.  The video transfer as well as the audio transfers are fabulous.  Unfortunately the spaces in between the episodes are not adequate for the typical DVD or Blu-Ray player to pick up.  With all of this said, I still enjoyed the set of five discs.",1412985600,3,887,4.5

5784813,4,B00D9EJFQY,"Although the harbor setting might be a little tiresome this is a very good show for anyone living during that era. Being from the bay area it's really interesting to see San Francisco as almost a sleepy town and with a lot less tall buildings compared to now. In one episode it gives a glimpse of Playland at the Beach the amusement park that's long gone. Anyone that ever went there usually remembers one thing the most....the Laughing Lady at the Fun House. Well for a few seconds she is shown in the episode, what a memory. One of my favorite episodes features Herschel Benardi , the story for me is almost diabolical and could of been stretched another 15 minutes and still be interesting. Like Highway Patrol and Coronado 9 it's the stories that are interesting and not so much the main characters. Wendel Corey is serious through it all and the dispatcher is close to bored. Got the series at a good price and like it.",1410220800,,924,4.505952380952381
5784814,3,B00D9EJFQY,"This was a T.V. series from 1958-1959 and centers around the west coast (California) police enforcement of the harbors. These are half hour episodes. All purport to be from real life crimes. Wendell Corey does a fine job, though at times he is a little too severe. Also, some to the episodes often leave you wishing to know what happened to those involved. In the later episodes it softens the police characters somewhat. I found this a good diversion. I like black and white and the 1950's were like that. The price was also rather reasonable.",1409356800,,544,4.677083333333333

5784828,3,B00D9EJFQY,"I'm a retired U.S. Coast Guard officer. The DVD box cover is a gross deception aimed a marketing an old TV series. It states it portrays the U.S. Coast Guard. There is nothing in this series that shows the U.S. Coast Guard. CAPT Ralph Baxter and his police officers are all civilians with the Port of San Francisco Police. I would return it for this reason. But for the cheap price, I don't think it's worth the effort. I'll watch it for what it's worth.",1403568000,4,454,4.352941176470588

5784830,3,B00D9EJFQY,"It is what it is....a remake of a 40's 1/2 hour series.  I thought there would be a lot more old San Francisco scenes but not that much just the bay and sometimes the credits thank San Diego???? The opening shot really does not look like SF.  Plots are simple but it was the 50;s if you like that kind of stuff its ok.  I did not watch the whole series, but will at some point .",1401321600,,378,3.883116883116883

5784851,3,B00D9EJFQY,"great nostalgia, typical of the ZIV shows of its day, but doesn't compare to the great ones like Dragnet and The Naked City...but the Harbor setting does make it somewhat unique.  Favorite ridiculous moments on the show are when someone in obvious distress and needing help dials the operator, instead of asking for the police, they want the 'Harbor Command'---fantastic!",1385251200,4,371,5.183333333333334

5784854,5,B00D9EJFQY,"Wendell Corey is one of those fine actors one could never forget, and in this series he stared as Captain Ralf Baxter for 39 episodes of the complete series.

The show follows the San Francisco Bay's United States Coast Guard Habor Police as they are kept busy with such issues as arson, murder, drug trafficing, the protection racket, counterfeiting and everything else connected to the criminal element.

This is a fine example of the television we had in the 1950s when it was young. In those days the studios didn't have the budgets of today and yet made top grade movies and television shows that entertained and created cult followings.

Do yourself a favor, get a copy, enjoy a series that entertained the people of a time long gone and not the eye-candy of today.

The series gets five stars as it is another great show long forgotten by many.",1384041600,2,851,4.653333333333333
5784855,4,B00D9EJFQY,"Harbor Command:

Done in the early B&W days of television I'm reminded of Highway Patrol with Broderick Crawford.  This is a great look back at a number of waterfronts along the California coast.  While advertised as the ""San Francisco Bays Coast Guard"" the story lines talks about a number of sea ports.  This is a marvelous snapshot of the times, and locations. This is also a great look back at waterfront life from the 1950's.

B&W - Aspect Ratio 1.33:1 Mono

While I've only watched disc #1, the quality is fine for the transfer from a 1957-58 television series.",1383264000,7,567,4.6767676767676765
