2896761,5,B000TEUSL8,great present for my dad who does not have cable (probably only person in the world) anyway being a Navy man and loving the water he enjoyed it so much. This was a great present,1217894400,,177,4.085714285714285
2896762,5,B000TEUSL8,"Deadliest Catch is a wonderful series!  I'm still watching the first series, but if you are interested in crabbing, fishing, or even just up for some good adventure, then this is the show for you!  Delivery was fast and I would definitely recommed buying from this seller.  I know that I will again.",1217203200,,299,4.60377358490566

2896764,5,B000TEUSL8,"I love this show and was so happy be able to watch this show anytime. The reality of this job is crazy, and the people that do the jobs must be crazy to do it, I say that in the best possible way. Watching this show is some what humbling, and I would tell anyone that wants to watch a show that is real to the core then get this show !",1215388800,,335,3.6666666666666665
2896765,5,B000TEUSL8,"I'VE ENJOYED THIS SHOW SINCE THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED, SO I WANTED TO OWN IT. THIS WAY I CAN WATCH THESE GUYS ANYTIME I 'D LIKE, OUT THERE DOING THE JOB MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T WANT TO DO. I LOVE THIS SHOW, AND THIS IS A EXCELLENT COLLECTION TO HAVE!!!",1208131200,,249,4.0
2896766,5,B000TEUSL8,"Deadliest Catch is one of those shows that rapidly becomes compulsive viewing.  The way the show is done is anything but repetitive, even though the goal is always the same - crab.  In this season, we get to watch the interplay between the crews under extremely icy conditions; and thankfully it is nothing like the so called ""reality TV"".  This is true to life stuff, nobody is trying to be a hero and some don't even quite make it.  The harsh realities of this deadliest job keep you on the edge of your seat for hours on end, and you'll find yourself laughing at moments such as the FV Time Bandit effectively going surfing.  What you are really observing is a fascinating insight into these guys' lives, and just what they do to make a living.  Alot of people will warm to the personalities of people like Sig Hansen and his brother Edgar; for some inexplicable reason everyone loves the FV Northwestern.  Mike Rowe does the narration for this series as usual (also spawning millions who all say in their deepest voice ""The vast Bering Sea""), and as usual the narration explains very well what is happening.  Good choice of background music which adds to the tension of what is happening.  Overall, thoroughly enjoyable.  I watched 5 minutes of this show on TV  and changed the channel, the next week I watched it and was completely hooked.  Can't wait for season 3 to be released now.",1200268800,16,1389,4.6016260162601625
2896767,3,B000TEUSL8,Ordered Deadliest catch season 1 and 2 and want to return because the gift receiver doesn't want it. I didn't receive a return form and it is past the 30 days since ordered.,1199664000,,173,4.2727272727272725
2896768,4,B000TEUSL8,"I was eagerly anticipating Season 2 of ""Deadliest Catch"" for more than one reason:  firstly, I feel as if I really know all these guys and wanted to see what new adventures they were having and, secondly, I use the show as an example of ""alternative careers"" for my students where I teach business courses at an inner-city high school in Rhode Island.  It is a true eye-opener for them as well as being entertaining!  (Ironically, last spring, after showing a few of Season 1's episodes, one of my students lost her dad who was swept overboard while lobster fishing off the RI coast - his body was never found.  It certainly reinforced how true ""Deadliest Catch"" really is.)

I highly recommend the DVD for those who want to expand their knowledge and experiences while being entertained.  I plan on buying ""Ice Truckers"" next, having heard it is just as fascinating.",1199577600,8,867,4.708609271523179
2896769,5,B000TEUSL8,"If you your life is hard or work is dangerous, these guys will give you
a run for your money. Highly recommend this box set.",1199404800,,124,4.0
2896770,5,B000TEUSL8,"Different though. There's less talk by Mike Rowe, but his voice is just perfect for this kind of thing. The end of the season episode, with the meeting with family members, is just the perfect end to a glorious show. I can feel completely identified with the human species watching it: priceless.

It gives less importance to the competitive side this time. There are no provisional ""scores"" but that doesn't play as a minus. Maybe there are not so many flashbacks either. There are moments without commentary, where one finds himself ""embedded"" on the seas watching just like one more man in the crew, silently living it from the couch.

Even if you don't care about the sea, watch it for its human worth. It's like an oasis away from politics and trivial city stuff.",1195603200,20,768,4.681481481481481

When I started watching the episodes, I realized this is the one season of DC that I actually saw.  I had just moved to Alaska, and when I went home for a visit my mom and I would stay up late gawking at the crazy freezing fishermen.  Little did I know years later I would be kickin' it with one of em! This is probably the best season. Being just season 2, it is not as over-produced and manipulated as it is now.",1306800000,,505,3.9313725490196076

2896816,5,B000TEUSL8,"This is an addicting little series from the Discovery Channel.  The captains have become folk heroes of sorts.  I turned into Martha Stewart one day and she was interviewing Sig Hansen and his brother while cooking a crab dish for them.

No matter how much the crew earns on these crab runs there is not a viewer on the planet who would say their overpaid.  They have sleep depravation, injuries, work cold and wet, bicker amongst themselves, wrestle 700 pound pots and face the real threat of being washed overboard and freezing in the arctic waters but they struggle onward so we can have our appetizer of crab with drawn butter.

Us loyal viewers learn the jargon of the crews and long to learn more of our favorite captains: Blond and handsome Sig Hansen of the Northwestern, acerbic Phil Harris of the Cornelia Marie, the wiley Hillstrand brothers (Johnathan, Andy and Neal) of the Time Bandit.

This is a show that you never lose interest in watching and is well worth your time and money.  I'm going to give this same review to each season.  bg",1233187200,,1051,4.612903225806452
