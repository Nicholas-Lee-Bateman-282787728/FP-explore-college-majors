To everyone of you who follows bushido and takes Musashi sensei as the best and most skillfull samurai fencer, and specially for those who study and practice Niten Ichi Ryu, this is the second best Musashi sensei saga movie ever made.

Their five movies are all splendid, ending with the epic duel against Kojiro Sasaki-sama. The 1950's trilogy with Mifune Toshiro is still # 1. But I love this one.

The first time I watched it was on computer downloaded files of the original VHS - released only in Japan. Now it's time for the fully restored 1961-1965 movies.

And Nakamura Kinnosuke is perfect as Musashi sensei. Nakamura is much younger than when he played ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" three season TV series in the 1970s.

I still hope and wait for the DVD release of Musashi-sama 1985 ""Sorekara no Musashi"" TV series... I'm waiting for years now...

Enjoy this box-set!

Ask the same thing to a Japanese samurai-film fan, and they will most likely think of this series, the five-film series by Uchida Tomo and staring Nakamura Kinnosuke (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Portrait-of-Hell/dp/B000CSUNUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Portrait of Hell</a>).

While I love the Mifune Toshiro, in Inagaki's trilogy it is hard to separate the actor from the role, and it is much more ""Mifune as Musashi"" than Nakamura's performance here.  Over the five films, Nakamura develops the character of Musashi from the wild beast of his youth to the sage warrior who duels on Ganryu island.  Nakamura was a kabuki actor who transferred over to film, and his acting style is more nuanced than Mifune's energetic performance.

Uchida's ""Miyamoto Musashi"" follows Yoshikawa's novel faithfully, from Takezo and Matahachi's survival at the Battle of Sekigahara, to Takezo returning alone to their home villiage and romance with Matahachi's fianc&eacute; Otsu.  After three years of study, the wild Takezo is transformed into the educated warrior Miyamoto Musashi and sets out to test himself against the great fighters of Japan.  Lurking in the background is Sasaki Kojiro, who watches Musashi's development as a sword fighter and who waits patiently for Musashi to refine his craft until the two face off at there famous duel at Ganryu Island.

This set contains all five films in Uchida's Miyamoto Musashi

Miyamoto Musashi - The wild youth of Takezo, who would become Musashi, and his relationship with Otsu, the former fianc&eacute; of this best friend Matahatchi, and who would be the love of Musashi's life

Duel at Hannya Hill - After devoting three years to study, Musashi's first test of his new skills is against the swordsmen of the Yoshioka Dojo and the spearmen of Hozo'in Temple.

Birth of the Nito-ryu Style - Musashi's next target is a duel with the famous sword master Yagyu Sekishusai, which leads to the creation of Musashi's renowned two-sword technique.

Duel at Ichijyo-Temple - Musashi's ongoing fued with the Yoshioka Dojo comes to a conclusion when he must face off against all seventy-three of its members.

Duel at Ganryu Island - Finally, the most famous duel in Japanese history plays out again on screen as Musashi stands against Sasaki Kojiro and his massive sword, the Drying Pole.

Animeigo has put out a beautiful collection of these five important films. (Although I have come to the conclusion that Animeigo can't help but put out a beautiful collection, because their standards are so high!).

Toei Company, their competitor, decides to do it all over again with a five part series staring Yorozuya Kinnosuke!
They're similar, but different, and both top quality programs easily worth watching... with maybe an extra star to the Toshir Mifune version (hey, it's got Toshir Mifune!).

4091819,5,B0038P1D0K,"I've seen this series probably about 35 years ago when it was shown on a local Japanese televison station.  This is an epic samurai movie series, in my opinion right up there with the Seven Samurai and anything else Akira Kurosawa or Toshiro Mifune ever did. The battle scences are awesome and the cinematography is just beautiful! They simply don't make movies like this anymore.  The best comparison I can make is that this movie series has the scope and feel of something like Gone With the Wind, samurai style. Up to now, most people have only heard about or seen the Toshiro Mifune version of Miyamoto Musashi, which was called ""Samurai"".  I've seen that version and it pales badly to this production.  Kinosuke Nakamura is simply fantastic as Miyamoto Musashi and is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast.

The movies show the spiritual development of Musashi from a drifter seeking fame and fortune to finally understanding and embracing the true spirit of the samurai.  The movie series builds up to the ultimate clash between Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro, Musashi's arch nemesis, truly one on the best samurai confrontations ever filmed.

If you love Japanese samurai movies or just plain appreciate a well crafted and beautifully filmed movie, I highly recommend this series.  I've hoped and prayed they would one day put this movie out on DVD and now my prayers are answered!! Order it by all means!",1268352000,47,1412,4.9033613445378155

4091846,4,B0038P1D0K,"This is a set of five films made in the 1960s about the legendary Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645).  An earlier trilogy made in the 1950s is more familiar to western audiences, but these films are better regarded in Japan.  Running about ten hours, the films are rather like a TV miniseries.  At times long and slow-moving, they tell an interesting story, and nicely recreate an earlier historical epoch.  Growing up during a time of civil war, Musashi evolved from an impulsive, rage-filled youth into a self-disciplined warrior.  In his twenties, he travelled Japan, fighting many duels.  His emerging reputation as Japan's best swordsman was heightened after he took on the prestigious Yoshioka school, killed their leaders in single combat, and decimated their rank-and-file.  Even in his heyday, however, he was regarded as a something of a renegade.  The final film showcases his longstanding rivalry with another skilled swordsman, Kojiro Sasaki, and the inevitable showdown.  Where these films improve over the earlier trilogy is in their deeper psychological insight.  Musashi is portrayed as more introspective, and the films suggest that his ambition derived from inner conflicts.  This is a more subtle interpretation, getting to the heart of Musashi's motives.",1351382400,2,1288,5.422110552763819

8391625,5,B0038P1D0K,"I purchased this DVD set of Miyamoto Musashi in September 2015 and thoroughly enjoyed it. The strong impression I have had is that Kinnosuke Nakamura portrayed Musashi in a way that felt more authentic and his own personality did not get in the way. I also watched Mifune's Musashi movie and felt less impressed. I am aware that Mifune's version appeared more popular and better known. But when I watch Mifune playing Musashi, I feel his personality gets in the way. His Musashi seems so much colored by his own personality style that I miss what Musashi might have been like.

This past week (June 19-23, 2017) my wife and I visited Kyoto. We made a particular trip to Ichijoji and saw the stone monument showing the place where Miyamoto Musashi defeated the Yoshioka school. A statue of Musashi was erected right in front of the shrine (Hachidai Jinja), near the famous ""Sagarimatsu"" pine under which the fights occurred. Some photos were displayed at the site and they were taken directly from the Ultimate Samurai starring Kinnosuke Nakamura. I have watched a few other Miyamoto Musashi movies by different actors. So far Nakamura's Miyamoto Musashi has stood out for me. Our trip to this historical site has prompted me to write this review.",1498176000,,1246,4.849765258215962

8391627,5,B0038P1D0K,"Miyamoto Musashi is generally considered one of the greatest swordsmen in Japanese history - and that's saying something because Japan produced countless sword masters. Born in 1584, Musashi fought in the pivotal Battle of Sekigahara (in the year 1600), which figures in the opening scene. Sekigahara ended centuries of bloody clashes among competing domains, and led to 250+ years of peace under the Tokugawa shogunate. You might think the absence of war defeated the need for swordsmanship in Japan, and that's true to some extent.

Only samurai were permitted to keep weapons, and wear the famous long and short sword combination in their sashes. It was Musashi who pioneered simultaneous use of both swords, which let him defeat multiple opponents attacking from all sides. When did samurai draw their swords in anger? Samurai could cut down a commoner with impunity for the high crime of failing to show respect - and each samurai was judge and jury as to what constituted that respect. But more important, each domain was law unto itself. There was no central system of law such as existed in England at the time. And samurai were their domain lord's enforcers, particularly as regards collecting taxes. The razor sharp samurai sword was persuasive among the populace.

In this epic series of five films Musashi rises to samurai rank - though the domain lord who elevated Musashi allows him to leave the domain without having rendered it service. Turns out Musashi has an ancestral relationship with the domain castle, a fact which the lord respects deeply.  More important, Musashi has just completed three years of intense study using the castle's immense library of Chinese classics. Through this study Musashi changes from impetuous, arrogant youth to the early stages of maturity. Presumably this also has made an impression on the domain lord. Musashi leaves the castle to seek further understanding and personal growth - and to become the best swordsman in Japan.

Earlier I brought up the question of need for swordsmanship in an era of peace. As it happens the samurai sword had a purpose outside either war or keeping commoners in line - and that was competition. Japan boasted martial arts training schools (dojos) with superlatively skilled masters. What better way to earn a reputation as a swordsman than to best sword masters from dojos run by renowned hereditary clans? This is what Musashi had in mind, and the series spends a great deal of time on these duels and how they came about. (There's also a romantic thread running through the series.)

There are five discs in this partially-fictionalized telling of Musashi's life, released annually from 1961 to 1965. The entire series is based on a novel by Eiji Yoshikawa which also was released serially - in a newspaper from 1935 to 1939. Yoshikawa's novel was the basis for another, earlier Musashi film,The Samurai Trilogy, but I suggest purchasing the 5-disc version instead. It's far superior. The acting is first class. The scenery is spectacular and so is the photography. More than once I found a particular frame suggestive of Dutch Golden Age genre painting. Composition of these frames alone is proof of Uchida's directing brilliance - regardless of whether he intended the Dutch reference. But the Dutch Golden Age does happen to overlap Musashi's life. It's also true that the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to remain in Japan beginning early in the Tokugawa period.

The film makes Musashi out to be not just one of the greatest, but the greatest Japanese swordsman, at least of his time.  That view, however, isn't unanimous. One expert I read claims that Musashi's ability to assess an opponent's skill allowed him to avoid duels he might otherwise lose. If true, maybe the awesome legend of Musashi's sixty successful lifetime duels is really less awesome than this picture would have us believe. (Definition of a successful duel: the other guy gets killed.)

Regardless, Musashi left behind more than the iconic legend of his  life. We have his enduring testament - The Book of Five Rings, along with other writings. These texts will best be enjoyed by martial arts students, as a quick scan through their pages makes evident - though the come-on is that the sword strategizing is transferable to more traditional arts like painting, sculpture and calligraphy - at each of which Musashi is said to have excelled.

The bottom line for me? I love this series and recommend it unconditionally.
