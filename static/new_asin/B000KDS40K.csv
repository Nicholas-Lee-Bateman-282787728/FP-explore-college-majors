8310164,5,B000KDS40K,"Without a doubt, this film won't appeal to everyone- it's rather rough around the edges, a low-budget film with many noticeable lapses in sound quality and rather slapped-together sets.
Nevertheless, Yolanda del Rio is amazing- her unusual looks and the awkward costume she wears for most of the film (a catholic-school uniform altered to accommodate her spinal deformity) are startling at first. But the singer-turned-actress plays ""La Jorobada,"" a kind-hearted hunchback girl, with convincing earnestness. Betrayed by her wealthy family, she is left penniless, barely finding sustenance on the streets of Mexico City. With the help of a little urchin boy, she eventually discovers that she is gifted with an incredible, heart-wrenching singing voice--- and the rest is history.
Note: In Spanish with no subtitles. Interestingly, however, I don't speak the language and the film is so universally fluent in non-verbal ways that I never felt that I was at a disadvantage, and had no trouble understanding what was going on.",1244419200,,1023,5.3602484472049685
