2058326,5,B00023GG94,"This is one of my all time favorite movies!  I think that Lauren Velez is a beautiful woman and a very talented actress.  The movie itself is very interesting, funny, touching at times, and it totally held my attention.  I am not Puerto Rican, but the film gives off the air of realism so I'm comfortable saying it seems to be a very realistic film despite the fact that I can't personally relate.... But since when do we have to personally relate to a film to appreciate it? Right? Right. So this is a great film, I love it and if you like this you should also check out Mi Vida Loca... these two are two of my all time favorites... its so rare these days that we get good, quaility, almost 'fun' films... u know?  Just good entertainment, that's what this film brings.  It's nothing too deep, but it hits below the surface in many ways.",1137110400,3,838,4.312101910828026
2058327,1,B00023GG94,"I think Lauren Velez is a great actress.  However, I really do believe this movie was neither comical nor realistic.  This movie gives Puerto Ricans, especially Neuyoricans a real bad look.  To all those who actually liked this movie, I'm not too suprised. Your bought into what Hollywood thinks of Latinos, and you really don't mind if this stereotype continues. Maybe if the director knew a little bit about Puerto Ricans, he might had put some effort into making the Puerto Rican characters real enough to believe. As a Neuyorican with dignity and respect for myself, my family, my community, and my ancestors I give this movie an F.

To the director, and producers, ""Put your money to use, pick up a book about hard working, educated Puerto Ricans. You might learn something.""",1129075200,5,780,4.842105263157895
2058328,4,B00023GG94,"I love this movie cause it's about two people who's love gets tested.  It's funny, it's sad, and it can make you angry.  That's what makes a good movie. And this is one of them.",1127433600,5,177,4.0285714285714285
2058329,4,B00023GG94,"The plot is centered around a semi-dysfunctional family in the Bronx. The leading lady's character ""Lisette"" begins this film totally dependent on her husband for survival and happiness. Her husband ""Chino"" is a macho latin man, but he finds himself in a position where he can not be dependened upon. They have three children, they're in a run-down apartment in the Bronx, she has suspicions of him being unfaithful, they're out of money, and their marriage is suffering. With all of these things in the plot this could be a serious dramatic film. But this movie takes a lighter approach to viewing this family's troubles. You watch them as they struggle with poverty, infedelity, trust issues and raising children as they're still trying to mature themselves. However, the movie never preaches or judges it simply keeps an affectionate eye on this family and keeps you completely engaged with their story. Throughout this film you'll be rooting for Lisette to come into her own as an independent woman.

 Although the movie is energetic and has a fun tone... it is still rooted in the real problems facing this family and there are scenes in this movie that will truly move you. Its these scenes that make the film worthwhile.

 There are a couple of veteran actors in this film such as Rita Moreno, and Jesse Borrego that make this movie worth buying. Jesse Borrego's character ""Alex or Alexis"" is the gem of the film and almost steals the show. The acting is superb and the music is excellent. The twists, sub-plots, and classic New York stories all shown in an imaginitive and fresh way; are what make this movie a winner.",1091491200,13,1626,4.796428571428572
2058330,5,B00023GG94,"I like it like that is a film like no other, it is as real as it can get. This movie brings me back when growing up in a Spanish Harlem. It is realistic, from the beginning to the end.  Each character in this movie is some one we know out there, they are so believable, that one could swear they've come across some of them at some point in their lives.
The plot of the story is very realistic l, from the financial difficulties and struggles that some Latin people in New York City come bypass very day, to the  love and romance in the two individuals feel for each other. It's a true example to how every day is a struggle to survive and make ends meet on top of all the discrimination that some go through out  in the real world.
Over all, this film will make you cry, laugh and re-think about the struggles that some people have to go through to get to where they are or they want to be.",1088208000,10,891,4.051136363636363
2058331,5,B00023GG94,"This is one of the few movies that highlights the reality of inner city living for Puerto Ricans. The lack of stereotypes and the honest way in which this movie addresses many of the cultural battles Puerto Ricans living in the US face are refreshing. I love the soundtrack and am SO EXCITED that this movie will be coming out on DVD FINALLY!!!! As a Puerto Rican, this movie speaks to what I've seen in my life and does it wonderfully!",1085011200,4,436,4.395061728395062

2058670,5,B00023GG94,I remembered this movie when it was first out . I thought it was funny and serious all in one . The humor was realistic from a New Yorkers perspective and the serious side was very typical of real life . John Sedan played a typical male dominant type and Lauren Velez played the the typical girl who is subject to this male dominance and was not afraid to show her clear objection to it . A great movie that any married couple will enjoy !,1370217600,3,439,4.116279069767442

2058701,5,B00023GG94,"The movie ""I like it like that"" is a movie I can relate to because I grew up in New York City in Manhattan & Brooklyn. I know what it's like to grow up in those situations like in the movie. I think the movie captured the true life of those who has lived in the past just like in ""I like it like that"".",1286409600,2,302,3.6615384615384614

2058727,5,B00023GG94,"I am a white, Jewish, New Yorker.

I first stumbled across this film in the mid nineties.  Within about twenty minutes I felt I had discovered something akin to gold.  My roommate at the time, listening passively, came bursting out of his bedroom to watch this movie as he liked what he was hearing!

This is a far better film than it is given credit for.  I don't really understand why Darnell Martin, who clearly has the talent for writing, casting and directing of a great film-maker, has spent the past decade in television.  OK, the money may be good there, but she is one of the very, very best writers and directors in our country.

I hope she will do more independent film work.  There are many reasons a person may get ""camera-shy"" after their work is so well received.  Fear of a sophomore slump, disgust with the movie business, feeling that they have made the only movie in them.

I hope for many reasons, for my own sake and for Ms. Martin's, that she has more effort to give to the movies.  This movie still has the power to make me laugh, and weep.  And if you knew me, you would find that surprising.

Cast is about as perfect as can be.  It is interesting to note that the two main characters, Lisette and Chino, are played by actors who have done very well.  Even Magdalena, the princess in the movie, has had a very robust career.  They were all terrific, as was literally every other actor in the film.  All were pitch-perfect and had great timing -- another tribute I think to Ms. Martin.",1198540800,2,1509,4.389891696750903
2058728,5,B00023GG94,"This movie has been out for years but I just stumbled upon it recently on late night cable TV.

I loved it! It was wonderful. I loved the emphasis put on the Puerto Rican community, I loved the up close, gritty look at average New York life. I loved the interactions between Chino, Lisette and the kids, they weren't perfect parents, but they loved their kids. I just loved how realistic it all was.

I'm a black woman, born and raised in California, I have no idea how life in the Bronx is but I definitely related to a lot in this movie.

My favorite character was Alexis, she was a trip!

5 stars!",1182297600,,600,4.2368421052631575
2058729,5,B00023GG94,This is one of my all time fave movies. Jon Seda did an excellent job as he always does. I especially loved seeing my idol from childhood Rita Morena ( and fellow Humacao resident) act in this movie. This movie is a must see! So much good Boricua acting going on!,1168905600,3,263,4.176470588235294
2058730,4,B00023GG94,"I think this movie made a decent attempt to capture the struggle of living in poverty as Nuyoricans.  It has a good amount of poignant moments from beginning to the very end and also its equivalent share of wacky hilarious moments, which I won't spill and spoil for you that should buy this movie if even you are latino or not, it doesnt matter.  I think anyone can relate or try to the struggles we personally face or others do.  I think the fact that I expected too much realism, being Puerto Rican myself, was a reason why I could not digest the exaggeration it portrayed.  If you want more realism about what it truly means to be hispanic or want to know more and you are not , please, please check out Manito I promise you will not regret it and will feel so much more moved than this movie.",1163203200,4,796,4.251655629139073
2058731,4,B00023GG94,"As a Lauren Valez fan I would have loved this film even if she just came on screen and recited the alphabet.  This is a sweet film about the trials of relationships when you have friends and family involved.  Jon Seda is great as a tough working father whose wife and family is his Achilles heel.  Lauren Valez is the young mother who has to think fast when her husband ends up in jail.  Fans of either actor would like this film, it's from the early 1990's, and you can see that their acting skills were still being honed at this stage.  I really did like the film though, especially the ambiguous ending.  Not bad for a Friday evening treat after a hard week at work.",1162684800,7,669,4.26984126984127
2058732,5,B00023GG94,I have always loved this movie. It made me cry and it also made me laugh. If your a young woman or man you will love everything about this movie.,1152403200,2,145,3.8666666666666667
2058733,5,B00023GG94,"This high energy and spirited look at a Puerto Rican community in the Bronx provides a wonderful little slice of New York life that is thoroughly enjoyable.
