2928636,2,B000V246TS,"I had absolutely nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, so I watched this film ONLY because Matt Riddlehoover was the writer/star/director/editor/etc.  Riddlehoover is beautiful, but that's not enough to carry this film.  This movie is poorly scripted, acted, directed, and edited.  There are jump edits worse than those I saw on Super 8 film 30 years ago in a college filmmaking class.  I see something promising in Riddlehoover's performance every now and again, but I fear it's little more than his stunning good looks.",1352073600,,527,5.093023255813954
2928637,1,B000V246TS,"(( I started this Comment after only one viewing of the film----but realized that was hardly fair where a negative rating is concerned.  So, a couple of nights later I sat in front of the screen, again.  Unfortunately, opinions were not changed, with another less than positive note added. ))

As lightweight and insubstantial a work as the simple, hand drawn dessert shown on film's title page and DVD cover.  Again, a short-ish film----with over one-half its running time devoted to main character's (Riddlehoover) interaction with various fag-hags (a term the filmmaker uses) (I reached the point of fast-forwarding through all that blather, which was spoken on R's. part in a sometimes ""monotony,"" sometimes ""singsong-ish"" manner).  For those seeking M/M romantic action, don't expect to see much beyond some quick (and tame) kisses and hugs.  Oh, and make sure you don't show any nipple (although Riddlehoover does like to run around in his ""tighty-grayies).

So-so production values are nothing to write home about----but I've certainly seen worse.  Many long / static scenes (such as two characters lying in bed, yacking and yacking to no great end) which, presumably, makes for a cheaper production (there's one shot of a couple in the far distance, walking away from the camera; they move even farther as we hear them talking; my guess:  zoom lenses are expensive).  Instead of churning out all these ""quickies,"" how about concentrating on just one that's well done (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>"").

Riddlehoover ""could"" (subjective) be more exciting looking if he'd put on a little toned weight.  Oh, and there's (subjective) something just a little prissy at times going on there.  Overall performance-wise, I'd give it to Jonas Brandon----though there's not a world of depth there.

Really not worth the money you'd spend on it........I'll be tossing it in the trash rather than take up shelf or storage case space.

PS--For better or worse, I had also ordered Riddlehoover's later work, ""Bookends,"" when buying the above DVD.  So, I've got that second one still to view.  My only hope is that there is way less time devoted to ""girlfriend"" interaction (is that really what these gay writer/directors think we really want?!).",1268179200,4,2346,5.418732782369146
2928638,1,B000V246TS,"After reading the two ""5 star"" reviews of this movie, I have to wonder if we all saw the same film?  Because the one I just watched was unbelievably boring and downright awful.  The acting was mostly terrible and as for the editing...well let's just say that my 8 year old daughter has done a better job cutting scenes together on her iMac!  Jonas Brandon who played Kevin (and two of the other parts) was kind of cute, and that's the absolute best thing I can say about this whole film.  I think the movie was billed as a romantic comedy, but it was neither.  I'm honestly not sure what it was, other than a great big dud.  I can't believe I just paid $2.99 to rent it.  It's an hour and 3 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  On a positive note, I will give Riddlehoover snaps for trying.  There aren't enough gay movies out there, so kudos to him for trying.  I just think he needs to try a whole lot harder.  Don't waste your money on this one.  You will be terribly disappointed.",1266624000,4,988,4.196808510638298
2928639,5,B000V246TS,"Suddenly I am caught up in this most accurate scenario of complex relationships in a gay mans life.
Matt Riddlehoover has that certain something a good comic actor needs in his timing in order to keep you interested. There is a lesson to be learned here, I won't give it away so buy the DVD and watch it with friends.
""It's a Keeper"" One I will be watching again and again.",1189728000,8,373,4.267605633802817
8216284,5,B000V246TS,"Simply put, if you like Matt Riddlehoover then you'll like this film. If you don't like him, you will not like this film.

I listened to the critics, on how bad his movies are, yada yada yada. I'm on my 3rd film of his & I think he's a great actor.

This film was interesting, in the way he has 1 actor play all the guys he's attracted to, because he always falls for the same type. That might be in other films, but I hadn't seen it before. The actor playing the different characters did a good job of making them believable.

Anyway, fun, very quirky, film.",1510444800,,559,4.157407407407407

8216287,3,B000V246TS,"To a Tee, first attempt of Matthew Riddlehoover onto direction (and  writing, editing, staring, etc) has many flaws, but some original attempts. The most original (and economical) is to make his obsession for a kind of man being interpreted by the SAME actor. David (Matthew) rolls through the film in search of an ideal subject to love, and always chooses the wrong person, usually to his own disappointment and making a mess on his own goals. Its a concise film, where you has to be very attentive not to confound the characters. But the message is clear. We keep searching for the charming prince at the wrong persons.  Thats the most valuable thing in the film,  which shows that Matthew has something to bring to the cinema.
With a very limited budget he can tell an original story, asking us to think, if we want, about out obsessions. The plot in itself I very simple, but revealing of what most attract us in people. Its worthwhile an attentive look.",1445040000,,958,4.65680473372781
8216288,3,B000V246TS,"Just finished watching 'to a tee"" written and directed by Matt Riddlehoover and released by Made It Myself Pictures.
""to a tee"" is Matt Riddlehoover's first movie; and it's a rather interesting one because none of the characters in this movie are particularly likable and are extremely self-centered - except for one. [In fact, the actress who played the most likeable character movie noted in the DVD extras that none of the characters are likeable in this movie.
Matt plays David - a playwright who takes the adage write what you know quiet literally - his plays are in reality one-sided views - his own - of his failed past relationships.  David is insecure and wants to be liked; but he isn't above using people to further his own aims and to focus on his favorite topic - himself.
Into the hollow that is David's life, comes a multitude of boyfriends - all played by actor Joss Brandon who masterfully takes on different apperances and accents.  David looses each boyfriend because he can't get past his obession with himself and his wants.
So when his best friend of the moment begins a relationship with the man she hopes to marry - naturally David wants him.  But its hard for me to have any smypathy for a woman who delibrately enters into a romantic relationship with a gay man thinking that she'll convert him, and then sets up a test with her boyfriend and gay best friend to see if they'll betray her.  SPOILER ALERT!  - DUH!
Riddlehoover creates an unflinching look at life in ""to a tee.""  Don't watch this movie if you're expecting characters to have life changing moments that causes them to grow and flourish.
Not a great movie, not a bad one either.
Recommended for those who are intrigued enough to see Riddlehoover's first movie.

8216290,1,B000V246TS,"wow, what a horrible movie. Clearly part of this awful Girls NYC fauxhemian scene.  We are led to believe this vanilla, shallow, vapid, guy is taking the play scene by storm.  The only thing being taken is the $3 I paid.",1388016000,,220,4.341463414634147
8216291,4,B000V246TS,This is a good movie of a young man's attempt at love.  Each of his attempts seems to be working well...when suddenly something happens to spoil things.  This movie is well acted and nicely directed.  The confusing part: each of the potential partners...different individuals all...is played by the same guy.,1385769600,3,308,5.12
8216292,1,B000V246TS,"this movie was horrible. the image, the definition, everything about the movie was hideous. this type of movie should not be on display.",1385683200,,136,4.956521739130435
8216293,4,B000V246TS,"For all the naysayers about Mr. Riddlehoover's movies/body of work, I think the guy is definitely talented and growing.  Too many viewers (read that gay viewers) these days look for sex, handsome bodies, and big budget, but have no idea what to do with a movie that is art house and takes thinking. Personally, I'm tired of gay movies where everything is cliche' et.al drag queens, love and lost, jumping from bed to bed, etc.  I would hope the general public wouldn't have to think that is what gay people are all about, but sadly, this is how they get their impressions.  This wasn't Matt's best or worst movie, but I have watched them all and I see growth and potential.  The problem with any new writer/director/producer of a new movie whether gay or straight is money and hopefully some Hollywood type will see what Matt is really made of and give him that chance.  Some of the most sweetest, poignant gay movies didn't have explicit sex, etc. (think Trick, Broken Hearts Club, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, and Beautiful Thing.) Great movies and memorable.  This is how I feel about Matt Riddlehoover's movies.  Each one a little better.  What great things may come?",1385164800,2,1173,4.74384236453202
