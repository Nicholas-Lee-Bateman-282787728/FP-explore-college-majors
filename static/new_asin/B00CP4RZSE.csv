5731850,2,B00CP4RZSE,"The film opens great. Body parts in jars filled with various colored liquids; a mad doctor (Martin Kove) exposing a woman (Orit Shuckroon) tied up on table; and blood splatter. From here the films moves into the promise land as it promises to be a naughty slasher, but doesn't deliver. Sara (Katherine Norland) produces a show called ""Babes and Ghosts."" 5 girls in bikinis go to a haunted mansion (guess which house) with the object of finding a ghost.

The film spends an hour setting up. Much of the eye candy consists of women in thongs sleeping on beds viewed through a night lens. Even the shower scene with Sara had hints of a flesh colored body suit...or maybe she really does have faint colored aureoles that stretch in a straight line from one side of her body to the other. Who knows? And do people still take Valium? That is so eighties.

The action that takes place 60 minutes into the film, which should have started 30 minutes into the film. There is not much character development. They made the photographer (Vincent Rivera) a jerk and uninteresting. They should have done more with Matti (Liana Mendoza) to make the ""Quarantine"" ending meaningful. And why do you bring in someone like Maribel Montalvo only to have her keep her top on the whole film? Disappointment all around. Oh yea, the acting wasn't that great either.

Parental Guide: Don't recall any F-bombs. Brief near sex scene. Nudity (Orit Shuckroon, Joanna Zanella)",1381190400,5,1444,4.768
5731851,3,B00CP4RZSE,"Minimal gratuitous frontal nudity, not very scary, it's an okay way to kill some time but far from a nail biting cliff hanger",1381017600,4,125,4.478260869565218
8584303,1,B00CP4RZSE,"Decent opening scene, but after that there wasn't a single moment that resembled a passable movie. I genuinely struggled to finish it. The acting, plot/script, production, effects, all far below average. The music in the credits even cuts off abruptly. There are so many ""Included With Prime"" movies you should be watching instead of this one. Truly bottom of the barrel.",1514160000,,371,5.098360655737705
8584304,2,B00CP4RZSE,I LOVE bad horror movies. But this was just poorly done. The lighting and audio made it difficult to watch,1506038400,,106,4.35
8584305,1,B00CP4RZSE,"If I could give zero stars, I would. It seems to be made by a 2 year old or someone with no knowledge of filmmaking. Sound is horrible. Lighting is atrocious. Editing and acting just bad.",1504569600,,187,4.222222222222222

8584308,1,B00CP4RZSE,This is awful. It is boring with bad acting and bad audio. Don't waste your time and for sure no money.,1503792000,,103,3.9523809523809526
8584309,2,B00CP4RZSE,"The sound drops in and out. Very cheaply made movie. It's so cheap, they couldn't even show the stabbing on screen; the stabbings would occur out of camera range then you would see the blood later.",1503619200,,197,4.5
8584310,2,B00CP4RZSE,No.  Cute bodies.  Not real interesting movie.,1501372800,,46,5.428571428571429
8584311,5,B00CP4RZSE,Good movie,1450137600,,10,4.5
8584312,5,B00CP4RZSE,I enjoyed this movie for the cheesy acting.  Only one actress had great acting skills.  Her performance was believable.  Can you guess who? Anyway the other actors made it laughable.  Corny accents and bad storyline made it hilarious!!! You'll get a smile just seeing people try to take themselves seriously.,1381363200,3,308,5.1
