8043452,5,B0006ULQQQ,"I love this concert.  It is the first one that Andre' gave in the USA.  It was filmed at Detroit in 1997 when he was
just getting started and it was just him and his orchestra.  I love seeing him play the violin and play the waltzes
that gave him the title, ""Waltz King"".",1378857600,,271,3.9814814814814814
8043453,5,B0006ULQQQ,"This was my very first introduction to Andre Rieu in 1997.  I had taped the show from a PBS pledge drive, until my VHS player get bad on me, and lost the tape.  Unfortunately this is not available on DVD, but I did find the tape on Amazon and ordered it.
I had never seen an orchestra have so much fun while they were performing.  The music is terrific, the musicians are way beyond talented, and Andre who is also a talented violinist, is fun to watch as he performs, and interacts with his orchestra.  The standard Strauss waltzes are performed, plus a few surprises from two of the musicians.  Great tape.  Hope someday it will be released on DVD!",1377388800,,650,4.375
8043454,5,B0006ULQQQ,"This one is fun to have.  You get to see Andre venturing with the humor as well as the music being exceptional.  I love seeing that so many of the orchestra have been with him for so long.  Not only does it tell you that he has their respect and loyalty but, I love watching them changing through the years just like we all do. Andre Rieu is inspiring.  He wanted to do something and has proven that he could masterfully.",1274832000,2,421,4.160493827160494
8043455,4,B0006ULQQQ,"This performance is also known as ""The North America I Love"", but doesn't match the audio CD. It's a fun view for hard-core Andre Rieu fans because it was Andre's first venture into North America, and his violin performance is crisp, fresh and energetic. His style is still developing and the orchestra is somewhat smaller, but there are great moments. At one point he harrasses some late-comers to the concert, as well as telling some interesting stories about the music he plays. Includes some delightful numbers he doesn't play often, like ""Im Krapfenwaldl (Cuckoo Song)"", ""The Third Man Theme"" and ""Circus Renz"".",1246838400,2,616,5.049019607843137
