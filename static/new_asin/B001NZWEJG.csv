8328563,1,B001NZWEJG,I have seen the movie before and loved it. But this copy did not work in 3 different dvd players. I was very upset over this. Movie gets 5 stars. This dvd should get zero stars.,1453852800,,177,3.9444444444444446
8328564,5,B001NZWEJG,"You have to see this movie. I have never seen a crazier movie. It has gangsters who don't age, wacky songs (inlcuding Prince song's from the original Batman), pirates, I could go on and on. It is so hilarious, without meaning to be of course.",1340582400,,242,4.4
