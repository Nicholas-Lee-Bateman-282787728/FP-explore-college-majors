8103286,5,B000E0ODSG,"Watch the doctors, nurses and medical staff in these hospitals.  Listen to every word they say.  Listen to the morlistic judgements and wrong assumptions.  Listen to the bad medicine that was state of the art knowledge when this stuff was first aired.  The thing I find most funny about not just Medic but Ben Casey and Dr. Kildare too is they all smoked like Pittsburgh Steel chimneys in their hayday.  Whenever I see a doctor offer a patient a cigarette I think to myself, ""Drumming Up Business Are We?"" as I laugh and my autistic brother gives me his patented what's wrong with that AUTISTIC WEREWOLF now look!

Speaking of autism imagine what it would be like going into one of these olden days hospitals with autism.  I don't have to imagine what it was like to be an autistic patient seen by the kinds of doctors on Medic, I lived through it. No matter how horroble you think it was triple it.  Of the three Ben Casey, Medic and Dr. Kildare Medica always tried to be more accurate and faithful to the real world life of doctors, patients and diseases it portrayed.  Medic was also notable for its prelogue that introduced a sort of disease of the week.  Also in Medic you were not apt to see so many patients dying. Dr. Kildare's patients had about a 50% survival rate.  On the early years of Ben Casey patients died like flies left in an airtight jar on a windowsill in the height of an August heatwave,

Watch Medic and see just how primative 1950's medicine was.  Look at how cold and dungeon like the buildings appeared.  Now for video quality these are perhaps the best footage to be had of these very old TV programs. You must remember TV was in its infancy when Medic was produced so image quality ws not terribly good to begin with.  Like many of the films of this era many suffered neglect or just the ravages of old age.  Sound quality is all over the map sometimes great other times not so much.  While not first rate by any stretch I have always found Medic series episodes very watchable.

Note there is a Medic DVD collection with even more of these old episodes but its overall audio and video quality is spotty good in some places horrid in others.  Just so you know the Medic series was filmed in black and white. The color pictures on the DVD's are just meant for artistic marketing appeal.",1402531200,,2314,4.440758293838862
8103287,3,B000E0ODSG,"I think the reason that Medic stood out from the other early TV series in the US was not because it was so good,so much as that the others were so bad. They were all shot on shoe-string budgets. But at least Medic had a mission  to open up medical and health practices to the public. This was an era when the word ""pregnant"" could not be mentioned on TV because the TV audience was perceived as having invited the programs ""into their own homes."" Likewise the doctor-patient relationship differed dramatically from the norm today. For example, it was considered  ethical  not to tell people that they were dying but only to tell their family members. This would be unthinkable now. Medic had decently plotted scripts which contrasted with the inanities of The People's Choice, to cite one particularly inane TV show. Or how about Topper? But Medic doesn't hold up the way the Twilight Zone does.",1372377600,,895,4.687898089171974
8103288,3,B000E0ODSG,"If you are a fan of the late Richard Boone, this show may interest you. It was such a long time ago, when TV was a fairly new medium and recording techniques were primitive, that it is very dated. ""Have Gun, Will Travel"", even at the beginning, was a big step ahead of this. This set is more of a collectors item than a group of shows to enjoy over and over.",1333065600,,358,3.986111111111111

8103291,3,B000E0ODSG,"Despite the understandably low quality of the DVD, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this series again as I remembered it fondly.  Even though there have been outstanding medical breakthroughs in the intervening decades, this show stood out as an interesting and informative source of information.  It is also a treat to see some actors who went on to much bigger and better things.",1208217600,,376,5.048387096774194
