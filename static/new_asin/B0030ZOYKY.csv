4047791,5,B0030ZOYKY,"Seriously this show is so fun and interesting, I regret not having watched it earlier. In fact, I wish it was more than 50 or so episodes. The coloring is vivid and the characters are unlike any others drawn. Best character: Black Star. He evolves so much as a fighter and is the ultimate BAMF. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys anime.",1291420800,,344,4.390625
4047792,5,B0030ZOYKY,"Up till now, ""Soul Eater"" has been a fairly lighthearted anime with some dark spots.... but that completely changes with ""Soul Eater: Part 2."" The first few episodes are pretty goofy, but it doesn't take long for the story to spiral into a dark, bloody blend of horror and supernatural action, as Medusa's secret plan goes into effect -- and the entire DMWA ends up facing their worst nightmare.

Things are going as usual for the meisters and weapons -- a challenging written test (only a few students actually manage to write anything), a visit to Excalibur, and Death the Kid's mission to a ghost ship that is attacking ships in the Baltic sea. But things take a dark turn on the anniversary party for DWMA's founding: Sid's mission to infiltrate Medusa's hideout goes horribly awry, the werewolf Free seals everybody inside a single tower in the school, and Medusa puts her master plan into action...

The only ones who escape the barrier are Stein, Maka, Soul Eater, Death the Kid, Liz and Patty, Black Star and Tsubaki -- and with everyone else trapped for the next hour, it falls to them to stop Medusa and her followers. It turns out that they're planning to free the most horrifying kishin of all, a creature so monstrous that Death sealed him under Death City. Maka and her friends must fight past Medusa, Crona and Free to block them from raising the malevolent Asura -- but even if they make it in time, they may not be able to stop it.

If the first part of ""Soul Eater"" was mostly lighthearted with some dark spots, then ""Soul Eater: Part 2"" is mostly dark with some lighthearted spots -- and what's more, meister missions to collect evil souls are pushed to the wayside. Instead, the focus shifts to Medusa's invasion of the DMWA and the frantic race against time to stop Asura from rising again... with the required string of one-on-one fights.

Sure, there's a few funny moments -- the test episode is pure hilarity, especially when Death the Kid spends the allotted time trying to write his name. But the overall feeling is one of horror, with plenty of grotesque creatures (Asura is freaky before we even see him!), bloody fights, nightmarish hallucinations (the teeth! THE TEETH!), and bizarre plot twists. And all the fights are pretty good and wonderfully imaginative, especially the nerve-tearing duel between Medusa and Stein, and the unveiling of Death the Kid's twin bazookas... brilliant.

The only major flaw is that the fiery magical duel between Death and his old enemy is awesome... but too short. Even one episode of them duking it out with scarves and spiky death-curses would have been good!

Maka and Soul have some new problems to deal with -- not only is Soul still being tempted by madness, but a Soul Resonance temporarily turns Maka into a raving grinning psychopath. But you know they'll come out all right, merely by trusting in each other; additionally, Maka finally manages to reach the weirdly bendy, androgynous Crona, who turns out to be even more scarred than we thought. And there's a brief, uncomfortable scene where we see inside the twisted mind of Stein... which promises to get even more twisted after this.

Things get dark'n'nasty in ""Soul Eater: Part 2,"" and they don't show signs of improving anytime soon. Fortunately, the handling of the fights and horrific stuff is nothing short of brilliant.",1262649600,13,3354,4.7923875432525955

8386347,5,B0030ZOYKY,"My daughter and I started watching this on Funimation and we got completely utterly hooked. The premise is fun, the characters are great, and there's a nice mix of intense action and comedy. You'll love the laid-back Soul, intense, studious Maka, demented tough guy BlackStar and the OCD-riddled Death the Kid. You'll want to take Tsubaki to a women's lib meeting, applaud the Thompson sisters for putting up with Kid, wring Excalibur's neck and worry about Dr. Stein's mental stability. The cussing and violence are too extreme for younger kids, but older kids and adults will love it.",1323388800,,586,4.989795918367347

8386350,4,B0030ZOYKY,"Ninjas battling classes death, and a kitten with major boundary issues.  This series is a must although if you read the manga the ending will be different to the manga.  Good character development in part two. More then one main character.  If you haven't read the manga a must but if you have you may want to skip this entire series.  The first three parts are good but the fourth is trailing way off the manga and could leave fans of the manga a bad taste in there mouth.",1292284800,,473,4.280898876404494
