8157935,5,B000FBPXA6,"Ever wondered how the villain in a Kung Fu movie is so powerful?

In a spiritual prequel to Big Trouble in Little China we get: ""The Villain's Journey."" Basically, we follow Grand Moff Tarkin on his quest for personal growth, and end with him ordering the destruction of Alderaan.

It's a Slytherin story--one of the best I've seen....ever.",1484265600,,340,4.844827586206897

8157938,4,B000FBPXA6,"It's not the best transfer in the world, but it's not bad. It's an English dub, which, nostalgia for ""Black Belt Theater"" aside is something of a disappointment. But, this movie is a pleasant surprise for turning the conventional trope of ""ne'er-do-well learns to be an upright man through Shaolin training"" completely on its head. I won't make with the spoilers but...why should everyone who goes to the mountain to study from the masters do so for honorable motives? And why should anyone strong enough to complete his training (although with a bit of cheating in this case) have to be of good character? Most of all, this movie shows what happens when a crucial moment from which much could be learned goes wrong. An interesting pic where the expected result turns out to be completely unexpected. I hate the whole 1-5 stars thing - it's so constraining. So in fairness to the movie and its unique take on a conventional plot, I give it a 4.

""SUCCESS?!""",1375660800,,957,4.696428571428571
