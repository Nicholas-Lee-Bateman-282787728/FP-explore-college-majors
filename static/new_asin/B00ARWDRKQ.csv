8557082,5,B00ARWDRKQ,"Now that all new ballets come out on blu-ray and DVDs made from HD masters, its a bit harder for me to go back to the older DVDs which give you a fairly good picture in close-ups and whole-body shots but are fairly blurry in longer shots.  After all, ballet is a very visual art and seeing a ballet in HD is like looking at a moving oil painting.  Because everything stands out more, theres more just impact.  Older DVDs are more like watching impressionism.  ...And the oldest ones of all seem barely watchable to me now.  I mention this issue because I just watched, in about a week and a half, all eight of the versions of Giselle that I own, six blu-rays and two older DVDs, and found that, although my all around highest recommendation would be for the French Pujol/Le Riche/Gillot version, especially if you want HD, nevertheless the performances I would perhaps have most enjoyed in person were on the old DVDs: the Italian Ferri/Murru/Seabra and the Russian Vasileva/Malakhov.  Below, Ill give quick reviews of all eight, in an order that suggests my own preferences, reminding the reader, though, that the dancing is mostly excellent in all.  All companies know what a big deal Giselle is and put their best people on it.  Because of their unique choreographies and the incredible contributions they made to the very concept of ballet, I personally consider the five most important classical ballets to be the three Tchaikovsky ballets, as well as Giselle and La Bayadere.  Others like Coppelia, Raymunda, La Fille Mal Gardee, etc., are, at least in my opinion, on a level a slight bit below.

DVDs:
(1) Ferri/Murru/Seabra, Teatro alla Scala.  Possibly the best performance of all.  But not for those who want a sharp image.  Standard older DVD look.  The whole concept and execution are fresh, natural, and sensuous.  Alessandra Ferri has the best stage presence of all the Giselles.  She takes some difficult parts faster than anyone.  Very nuanced conducting with shifting tempi.  Chor especially good in Act 2.  This kind of performance is what critics call a sheer delight.  Why not have fun?

(2) Vasileva/Malakhov, State Theatre Academy in the Kremlin.  Not for those who want a sharp image.  Standard older DVD look.  Best Giselle and Albrecht dancing of all.  It would have been awesome to be there.  The pairs form and sense of esthetics are unsurpassed.  Vasilevas performance is not absolutely flawless.  Her foot wobbles for balance once or twice more than the average, but this doesnt really matter.  Her dancing is absolutely stunning.  She does perhaps the best spinning arabesque, unique to Giselle...or else shes tied with Osipova.  Despite the usual Russian poor theatrics, she is credible and sympathetic.  Just from the point of view of dancing, Malakhov is probably the best Albrecht.  He reminded me of Nureyev.  The stage seems too big, so that the general interactions sometime seem more forced.  The chor in Act 1 is too symmetrical and, thus, artificial.  The female soloist in the Act 1 divertissement is very good, but the male seems to be having a bad day.  The staging tempo is jerky and sometimes there are holes with nothing to look at.  Myrtha is very good.  The orchestra sounds terrible.  The horns flub one part.  Theres a lot of coughing on the sound track.  It doesnt say when this was recorded, but it has a sort of desperate, Soviet feel to it.  Kind of cool, in a way.

Blu-rays:
(3) Pujol/Le Riche/Gillot, Paris Opera Ballet.  Probably the best bet for those who want HD.  Pujol is totally solid throughout.  Le Riche is an excellent dancer although his robust physique makes him seem a little less subtle/fine than most Albrechts.  Gillot is perhaps the most impressive Myrtha.  Most well integrated, dramatically effective choreography and theatrical direction throughout.  Best mad-death scene.  Gorgeous costumes, very French.  Probably best chor.  Tied for best Act 1 divertissements with Nunez/Muntagirov.  Excellent orchestra under Paul Connelly.  Tied for best cello.

(4) Osipova/Acosta/Kobayashi, Royal Ballet.  The dancing here is vivacious and very engaged.  Like Le Riche, Acostas body is more on the robust side, which affects the way you see his lines especially in his solos.  Hes a top dancer, though.  Osipovas exotic, even strange, beauty is perhaps a little distracting in the first act, but in Act 2 she looks perfect.  Her naturally chalk-white skin is quite ghostly indeed.  Her spinning arabesque is tied for best with Vasileva.  Her puppet-on-a-string solo toward the end is more or less tied with Vasileva too...or maybe its the best.  Its truly something to see, anyway.  Kobayashi as Myrtha is beyond stern all the way to dead.  In my opinion, Myrtha should have some tiny hint of personality or expression.  Her dancing, though, is perfect.  If you want to have two or three Giselles, this should be one of them.

(5) Kojokaru/Kobborg/Nunez, Royal Ballet.  Very good theatrical direction and choreography.  Some of the best Giselle dancing on the part of Kojocaru.  Kobborg is the most appealing Albrecht, i.e., he has the greatest stage presence.  He seems relaxed.  Great chor in both acts.  Nunez is a fine Myrtha.  Her leaps are outstanding.  Particularly sensitive and well-timed videography, which may be why this performance gave me shivers more often than the others.  Best oboe.

(6) Tsygankova/Varga/de Jonge, Dutch National Ballet.  A very sumptuous traditional production with rich costumes, a great set, etc.  I like the fact that there are children among both the peasants and the nobles.  It adds a feeling of naturalness.  All the dancing is first rate.  Tsygankova and Varga have chemistry and seem like a real couple.  De Jonge dances well and is probably the most beautiful Myrtha.  Her dead makeup is great.  Perhaps the most natural feeling production after Ferri.

(7) Nunez/Muntagirov/Mendizabal, Royal Ballet.  Choreography, sets, costumes, etc. much the same as in the Osipova and Cojocaru versions.  Excellent chor.  Tied with Pujol/Le Riche for best Act 1 divertissement.  Nunez is one of our best ballerinas but she is miscast here as Giselle.  Of course all these superballerinas are too old to play a pretty village ingenue, but Nunez features are far too strong and set.  In La Bayadere, she is the best Damzati imaginable.  She is also a very credible Odette and a perfect Odile in Swan Lake...not to mention her Myrtha role in Kojokaru/Kobborg.  But sorry, I didn't quite buy her here.  Her dancing and acting are both brilliant, although there are more extreme puppet-on-a-string solos.

(8) Lunkina/Gudanov/Allash, Bolshoi.  Light, subtle, effortless dancing.  I felt at times their smoothness was almost too smooth.  Fair acting, though Lunkina is very likeable.  Somewhat corny costumes and sets.  Nice orchestra.  Allash is a good Myrtha, although her natural prettiness perhaps needed to be offset by something...makeup or a bit more ferocity?  All in all, a very fine version definitely worthy of purchase.",1508889600,,7027,5.035745422842197
8557083,5,B00ARWDRKQ,"I own seven dvd's/vcr's of Giselle and have watched three additional ones.  Not a clunker in the bunch, really.  I like all of the Giselles I have seen and all of the Albrechts as well.  Here we have Alessandra Ferri being Alessandra Ferri.  We'll start with her costume for Act I:  A bodice that comes up close to, but does not begin to cover, her breasts, and beneath that an it-can't-get-any-more-gossamer blouse that let's you see every detail of her breasts underneath it.  (I have seen a photo of her in Act I also from La Scala and also with Murru, and in it she wears a ""traditional"" costume, leading me to think that she wore this costume only for this video-ed production.  Well, that's the Alessandra Ferri that we all know and love of course, the sexiest of ballerinas.)  So here she is sending a double message, playing Giselle ""straight"", as a young, simple, shy peasant woman, being message number one, and message number two being ""Look at how sexual I am"".  Well, that's the Alessandra...again.  So first time watching this I could only stare at the sexual part in close-ups.  Not a good choice from her from a purely artistic standpoint.  (Then we ramp it up in the Mad Scene, in which the same gossamer blouse moves off her shoulders completely and we are all-the-time wondering if it is going to end up totally exposing her breasts.)  Nevertheless, Ferri's Mad Scene is a gem, showing the most shear madness of any Giselle performance I have seen.  Murru is also excellent, showing a decent amount of ""chemistry"" with Giselle and reacting convincingly in the difficult moment when his treachery is exposed.  (Also here a good reaction from Mairizia Luceri as Bathilde, his betrothed.)

Both principles are excellent in Act II, and matched in that excellence by the corps de ballet and by Isabel Seabra as Myrtha.  Sublime corps work here, no question, with all the Wilis being about equal in height and all looking totally Italian--i.e., all brunets.  And Seabra:  She could not be finer, really.  Tall, with long arms and legs, she commands the stage in her solos--wonderful.  High leaps.  And, acting-wise, she does not adopt the ""usual"" icy-and-disdainful demeanor of the usual Myrtha-portrayer, but instead assumes the look and aspect of one who has been deeply hurt, deeply hurt.  (Marianela Nunez assumes a demeanor of hurt-and-hardness in her assaying of this role, and is also equally wonderful and original.)

Attentive and sympathetic conducting by Paul Conelly.

What do you want in your Giselles?  If you love superior technique, go for Osipova.  If you want a superb over-all concept and attention to nuance and detail, go with Lunkina.  Here you get great drama and much excellence.",1489449600,,2716,4.87117903930131
8557084,5,B00ARWDRKQ,"I have been an avid ballet fan and subscriber to the American Ballet Theatre for for over 3 decades.  Giselle is one of my favorite ballets. Alexandra Ferri is so moving and exquisite in this production , you get drawn right into the story. This is a must for any ballet afficionado's library.  The selection of DVD's offered by Amazon is better and more extensive than what I have found at Lincoln Center .",1472083200,2,407,4.486486486486487
8557085,5,B00ARWDRKQ,"My ballet and opera records have spent the past three years buried in packing cases waiting for the moment when space would mysteriously appeared to unpack them. That occasion arose and this was the first record I  played. It was a reaffirmation for me that scarce space could not be put to any better use than watching this and other first rate performances. While the entire cast did an admirable job, at least by my layman's standards, Ferri was gossamer light in the happy beginning of the  story, completely fulfilling the role of a young woman in love. As was intended, the darker period that follows remained infused with the effervescence of her youthful joy, making the tragedy that follows, more striking. Whatever the mood, she suited its demand admirably. The role of her lover, promised to Royalty, Murru, not only gave her the partner she needed but was impressive when assuming center stage. The scenic design was simple but adequate, the featured and supporting dancers, providing solid support for the production. If still available, worth buying.",1400630400,5,1064,5.005649717514125
