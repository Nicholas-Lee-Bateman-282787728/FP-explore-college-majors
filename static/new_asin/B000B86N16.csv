8083254,5,B000B86N16,"I bought this DVD on a whim at an arts festival in Atlanta some years back. My oldest was about 5 yrs old at the time. She would watch it over and over! Now my kids are 10, 8 and 6 yrs old and ALL 3 love it! I like it because the animation is unlike ANY other film we own. It's ""artful"" and, I believe, has stirred their creativity and appreciation of music and story.",1369612800,,368,3.8552631578947367
8083255,5,B000B86N16,"Two of my students in Children's Church had their mom give me a copy of this movie -The Legend of the Sky Kingdom- to watch, saying, ""Marylynn will love this movie.""

Well, they knew me well and they were right!  More importantly, I believe they know why I'd appreciate it so much.  This highly creative, greatly imaginative movie depicts the message of the salvation of Jesus Christ in a highly unusual medium.

Before we come to know Jesus (Prince Ariel in this movie's case), we're serving an evil master and going nowhere.  When we realize there might be something more - a sky kingdom we've never heard of before! - we'll do whatever's necessary to get there including stepping out in faith on a bridge that's invisible before we can begin.  The life's journey includes pitfalls along the way, like the Jungle of Despair and the Desert of Desolation.

What the writer and producers from Africa (Zimbabwe) of this movie did must surely have been a first.  They had a very small budget and so they created a genre - ""junkmation"" - in which they used all kinds of junk to create their characters and scenery. Brilliant. Thank you, Nathaniel and Matthew, for sharing this movie with me.  And thank you and congratulations to the creative geniuses behind this movie.  I truly believe God gave them their talent, but more importantly, they used it to bring His loving and exciting message to children in a way never heard of before!",1226620800,3,1431,4.688
8083256,4,B000B86N16,"""The Legend of the Sky Kingdom"" is a subtly funny and visually creative account of several kids escaping their orphanage life and journying to the Sky Kingdom. The use of junk for the characters, backgrounds, etc. is unique, and the story follows a basic ""Pilgrim's Progress"" theme.",1203206400,2,282,5.0212765957446805
8083257,4,B000B86N16,"To my knowledge, this is Zimbabwe's first feature-length animated film - and it's a unique entry into the history of animation.  With little more than a camera and a heap of discarded trash, a team of remarkably resourceful and talented individuals cobbled together a vivid and complex stop-motion feature (according to the ""making of"" documentary, they even made their own motion control camera out of bike parts!).  At times, the film elicits real wonder, from silverware vampire bats to rushing cellophane rivers to characters that run, stumble and breathe in a world that seems at once both surreal and tangible.  If you really like animation, particularly stop motion animation, you may want to pick this up right now.

As for the story - I find it a bit difficult to comment on that.  Three orphans recieve divine assistance in breaking out of an oppressive city, and must weave their way through many dangers in search of the fabled ""Sky Kingdom"" -- a promised land of everlasting peace.  It is clearly a Christian parable, but, like many Christian parables oriented towards children, I find its spiritual content to be too simplistic and the actions of its characters, frankly, a bit too violent.  That said, I'm certain there are many who would disagree with me on this, and those who give the film a try are unlikely to find anything truly objectionable in it, regardless of their beliefs.",1136160000,4,1399,4.9025423728813555
