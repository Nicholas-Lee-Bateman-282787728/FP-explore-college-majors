8502926,4,B006PWVYNY,"Dil Tera Deewana is an originally black and white film starring two very successful actors in the lead roles. At the time this film was made, Shammi Kapoor's stardom, with his trademark boisterousness, self-deprecating humor and ""Yahoo!"" had been fairly firmly established, and you can see all of those trademarks in this film. Mala Sinha had a strong career last lasted almost twenty years, and this movie finds her on top of her game.  The film itself is typical comedic fare for that era in both Indian and Western movies--broad, slapstick humor, lots of double-takes, an almost manic feel to the performances.  In fact, Shammi Kapoor reminded me of Hollywood's Jerry Lewis in Dil Tera Deewana--right down to the braying laughter.  It's a highly improbably plotline, pretty much par for the course for Bollywood at that time, including a favorite Bollywood theme--that of mistaken identity.  Having said all that, I don't mean to imply this film isn't worth watching.  I thought it was funny and almost sweet and very evocative of film styles of its era.  If you are a westerner who likes classic Hollywood films from the 50's, I am certain you'll like Dil Tera Deewana. If you're an Indian who loved Shammi Kapoor, I think you'll like this movie.",1490572800,,1250,4.900473933649289
8502927,5,B006PWVYNY,It is a mixed bag of goodies in this movie as played by veterans with different styles and approaches and yet for the same common theme.. Shammi;s movies and those of Mala Sinha have all so far been a Hit. These include Hariyali Aur Rasta and Kashmir Ki Kali to name a few. This  seems to have been redone in color to stand quite remarkable. Most of songs are sung by M Rafi along with Lata and Asha with their  ever golden voice. .,1457481600,,432,4.130952380952381
