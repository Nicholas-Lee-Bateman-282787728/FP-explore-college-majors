7868155,3,6304267002,"This movie although not an academy award winner, it moves along with a creative little segment oriented drama/comedy twist. It reminds me a lot of ""Death Trap"" in respects to the teaming up of the three characters. They plan little things against each other, but They end up realizing they are all in the same boat. The story twists to them remembering and sharing different memories of theirs lives and then acting out in desperation. It's a must see for any one who enjoys a fast pace ever changing little drama/comedy. Don't expect to much, but expect enough to walk away feeling like you didn't waste your time.",988416000,4,615,4.703703703703703
7868156,4,6304267002,"Suppose the pipeline from corpse to afterlife suffers gridlock every now and then? And the Angel of Death has to park a few souls somewhere? Now - suppose, after the souls have gotten to know one another, the Angel returns  with the news that he took one too many - ? And the souls have to decide -  who gets to go back? Robert Forster makes a fine Angel of Death; Hauser,  Paul, and the other members of a small cast turn in fine performances as  well. See it if you can - own it if possible: a great sick-day treat.",964656000,6,517,4.089108910891089
