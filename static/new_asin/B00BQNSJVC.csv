5666836,5,B00BQNSJVC,"I loved this movie. I will make this short and simple. If you like emotional movies with just enough drama, then watch this movie. Judging on the imdb avg score, I would say this movie is higher than where it currently stands at 7.2. I would be happy to see this movie at a 7.8 or higher.

5666837,5,B00BQNSJVC,"I heard about this movie reading some reviewer's favorites from 2012. Of course I'd never heard of it, and figured I'd never see it. I got the chance to watch it on a flight from London to Chicago. Oh my goodness! This might just be the best movie I have ever seen! Everything rings so-true. Please see this movie. You will be thinking about it for a long time, and it may change you in ways you have not imagined. Important ways. Themes touched on are bullying, accusations-both true and not true, PTSD, redemption, fate, the ""system"", essential goodness, and love. Aren't these things that you see a movie for?",1373500800,13,612,4.572727272727272
5666838,5,B00BQNSJVC,"I am a big fan of the on-going Film Movement DVD library of foreign and indie movies. This is the January, 2013 release in the Film Movement DVD of the Month Club, and will be released to the public at large in the months to come.

""Broken"" (2012 release from the UK; 91 min.) brings the story of an 11 yr. old diabetic girl nicknamed Skunk (played by Eloise Laurence), who lives on a cul-de-sac in a very much middle-class neighborhood in Britain. At the beginning of the movie Skunk sees Rick, a young man living across the street, getting violently beaten up by yet another neighbor, Mr. Oswald. We later learn that one of Oswald's daughters, in order to save face, told her dad that Rick raped her, following which Oswalt in a rage pummels Rick. We meet other charachters like Skunk's immediately family (her dad is played by Tom Roth), and also Mike, the teacher and boyfriend of Skunk's live-in au-pair. Given the plot-heavy nature of the movie, to tell you much more would flat-out ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is a heavy psychological family drama, and at times very bleak (but never without hope). There are several devastating scenes in the movie that will rip your heart out, so viewer beware. Not having read the book that this movie is based on, it's impossible to compare the movie vs. the book, but if the book is anywhere near as good as this movie, it will make for an excellent read. Kudos to director Rufus Norris for piecing it all together into one fantastic viewing experience. But the greatest compliment must go to newcomer Eloise Lawrence, who brings a ""lights out"" performance as the 11 yr. old girl. Please note that the DVD comes with several nice bonus features, including interviews with Tim Roth, Eloise Lawrence and the director. There is also the monthly short movie (unrelated to ""Broken""), which happens to be an outstanding 15 min. US shortie called ""The Way the World Ends"". Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a quality indie movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you will be richly rewarded with this. ""Broken"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1363132800,24,2167,4.68503937007874
5666839,5,B00BQNSJVC,"Every scene in this film, starting with the very first, was layered with dramatic tension and meaning. The acting was phenomenal (do British actors just go to better schools or something??), and the dialogue felt very authentic. I liked how none of the characters were portrayed as perfect; all have their flaws and their redeeming qualities. Don't pay any attention to the 62% Rotten Tomatoes score.

5666841,4,B00BQNSJVC,"This was a strange but good movie. It took a while for it to appeal to me. It has pretty graphic physical violence, casual sex, and much profanity especially from the young ones in this film. The main character, ""Skunk"" comes from a broken home and faces difficult situations and relationships in her young life where it seems she is looking for love. The characters are very interesting and exhibit bizarre behavior that keeps the movie flowing at a good pace. There is a very clever technique used where a type of ""flashback"" is shown immediately or a few minutes after an event or occurrence happens in real time. This explains why a particular action occurred and how it fits into the story line. Skunk is on an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film but good performances are seen by the father, Tim Roth, her teacher, Cilian Murphy, and her strange neighbors. Some of the dialogue was lost because of the strong British accents, but overall a good sentimental and tender drama that is worth your time.",1506988800,,1013,4.761363636363637

5666847,4,B00BQNSJVC,"Very well made movie. Except for the last 5 minutes(which, I did like in closing a movie/story), this movie is life itself, portrayed as realistically as possible about this tween-ager.
Teaches us about situations that go wrong, and end up defining people, esp Archie. The first 5 minutes, set the stage and has a domino effect on Archie. It is extremely sad/unfortunate, that this divide between a parent and child builds up. And throw in a incident like this, everything falls apart. I am a parent. And gosh, is parenting difficult.
If you go thru the closing credits(for some reason, I ended up sitting thru), the director has put a lot into this movie, even lyrics for the songs.",1493251200,,683,4.7478991596638656

5666856,5,B00BQNSJVC,"I think instinct is to rate this movie low because of the way the story makes you feel. It's a very real, very sad, and bleak experience that leaves you almost as broken as the characters. However, I truly believe this film is worthy of five stars. The casting was excellent, the story is well-written and thought-provoking, and the characters are flawed and easy to relate to. I have watched it multiple times and consistently find myself returning because it is just brilliant. I think you get more out of it the more you watch it.
  The story centers around 11-year-old Emily or ""Skunk"" as she is referred to by everyone who knows her. She witnesses her neighbor Rick, a young man who lives across the street, getting attacked right in front of her by another neighbor, Mr. Oswald. This is a pivotal moment which sets up the remainder of the film. This one horribly misguided action is what puts these broken characters on separate, yet connected tumultuous paths throughout the rest of the film.
  Mr. Oswald is a hot-headed single father struggling to raise three daughters on his own in the wake of his wife's death. When he discovers a condom his middle daughter took while snooping through her elder sister's room, he confronts her about having sex. He has a tendency to overreact and act out violently, especially when it comes to his daughters. So her dad doesn't believe her when she tries to tell him she isn't having sex and forces her to falsely name the first guy she can think of, which just so happens to be their neighbor, Rick. Mr. Oswald immediately assumes Rick must have raped her which incites the attack we see at the beginning of the film.
  Skunk's world is thrown into turmoil after witnessing this horrible act of violence that was seemingly unprovoked. Rick, who was mentally imbalanced to begin with, falls into a deep depression and worsening mental state following Mr. Oswald's accusation of rape. The characters' failure to understand each other or to even communicate reasonably with each other only makes things worse. Skunk at one point complains in the film, ""Everything always goes wrong. Why do only bad things happen?"" which consistently proves true throughout the movie. Bad things keep happening left and right and Skunk struggles to find her way through the mess. Her dad tries to be there for her as much as possible, but for the most part Skunk braves the terrible things on her own as she desperately tries to navigate the confusing and violent grown-up world she's witnessing.
  Every character in this film is sort of in their own world--absorbed in their own problems and self-interests--which is a big part of the problem and what keeps making things worse. Skunk is stuck in the middle and, consequently, is the only one who witnesses all of it. Broken explores themes including the loss of innocence, growing up, and how one lie can have a wide and damaging impact. It is an emotional and dark film grounded in real life. I enjoyed watching characters that were truthful, broken, and far from perfect. There's a certain perfection in imperfection. The truth is there is no perfect and getting to see characters who continue to try and work hard at life, even knowing that fact, is part of what makes this movie so great. The soundtrack was also pretty amazing.",1479513600,2,3312,4.767888307155323

5666896,4,B00BQNSJVC,"This film is a peak into the bi-polar reality of today's society. Filmed in the UK, we follow a young girl, Eloise Laurence, as she observes the life around her. She lives in a cul-de-sac of three families, all of them are Broken. One family across the street has a brain damaged son that the parents have no idea how to handle, next door a man whose wife died and left him with three young daughters, all self absorbed and start the lie that ends in tragedy. 'Skunk' as she is known, the 11 year old, lives with her father and brother. Her mother left home when she was small. They have an Au pair, a young attractive woman who lives with them. She is involved with a young man they all like, but that falls to pieces when, Martin, the young man becomes a commitment phobe.

One lie starts the process of violence, arrests, commitment to a mental institution and then great tragedy. Throughout this process, Skunk is trying to take it all, deal with a new school, a new friend and the lives of those around her falling apart. At times the film seemed too much. Too much for these three families, do they all have to go through life's turmoils and troubles, does no one get a break? The writing is superb, the acting top notch. Tom Roth plays Skunk's father, a therapist of sorts, it seems he needed to start with himself, his family, then the neighbors.

If this is a microcosmic of our society, we certainly need help. A good start is for parents and children to start with a trusting, loving relationship. This film can be pretty gruesome in parts, violent and emotionally difficult to take. Use some caution, we are all broken, and this film magnifies all of us.

Eleven year-old Skunk (played brilliantly by Eloise Laurence) is charming, sweet, and surrounded by situations that make a young girl grow up too fast. The language is rough throughout and the acts of violence accelerate leaving you screaming to make it all stop and let us catch our breath.

Skunk's father, played by Tim Roth, is charming and desperately trying to keep his single parent family in good shape. Some of the most touching moments are when he is sitting quietly and talking to Skunk. The love of a father and daughter pours off the screen. He is amazing.

A wonderful film, albeit sad and... 'broken.'

I love the short film bonus as well. Hard to explain but a beautiful concept of loss.",1385769600,,962,4.511494252873563
5666909,5,B00BQNSJVC,"The sixth entry in the Film on Friday series is Broken - starring Tim Roth and Cillian Murphy, directed by Rufus Norris. This film has won a large number of awards - amongst them, Best Film at the British Independent Film Awards and it was also an opening night film at Cannes Critics Week.

 Eleven year old Skunk lives with her brother, father and housekeeper in a cul-de-sac populated by only a few families. Hers is not the only family touched by tragedy (Mom has run away). Neighbour Bob Oswald's wife has died, leaving him to raise his three hellion daughters. Mr and Mrs Buckley live with their brain damaged adult son Rick across the street.

 Skunk witnesses a violent attack on Rick by neighbour Bob who is convinced that Rick has sexually assaulted one of his daughters. That attack seems to be a catalyst, triggering a chain of events that impacts every resident of the cul-de-sac. But none more than Skunk. Her naivete is slowly eroded by the anger she witnesses both outside of her home and within - the housekeeper and her boyfriend have a tumultuous relationship.  Skunk makes tentative overtures into exploring her own burgeoning sexuality, but is exposed to more than an eleven year old needs to see. The violence continues to escalate, following her to school and eventually erupting on that dead end street.

 Each and every character in Broken is, well, broken. Norris explores the human condition through the dysfunctional relationships portrayed. But also through the good and positive as well. Themes of love, hate, forgiveness, loss, hope, friendship, bullying, mental illness and more are explored.

 You could draw many parallels between To Kill a Mockingbird and Broken - Scout/Skunk, fathers who are lawyers, a minority being persecuted and a loss of innocence. But Norris puts his own stamp on things in Broken. I started out feeling one way about a number of the characters and found my reactions and thoughts turned around by the end.

 Eloise Laurence is new to acting, but I predict she has a future in the biz. She was wonderfully unaffected and realistic. Each and every actor involved was excellent. Norris effectively uses single, isolated shots of the principles, underlining their isolation.

 I thought Broken was truly an excellent film. Not easy to watch by any means - I did stop it two or three times to get up and come back in a few minutes, but one that was absolutely riveting. Five stars.

 United Kingdom. 2012. 90 min. Drama. English

 As always, Film Movement includes a short with their main feature. The Way the World Ends again manipulates our perception, starting off with what seems to be a light premise and turning into something altogether different. And it paired well with Broken.",1384473600,3,2742,4.875

I bought the book. The book is far more intense and makes more sense than the movie. Mark O'Rowe's screenplay is a poor shadow of the book. Tim Roth was excellent, as usual.

5666912,5,B00BQNSJVC,"For all the horror films that depend on zombies, vampires, werewolves and the like to place a fantasy make believe world before us to frighten us, none is as terrifying as this very realistic, extraordinarily well written, well photographed, well directed and well acted gem from Film Movement. It is a British product (BBC) and seems to have had a minimal response in the theaters. Now more available to the public, hopefully this brilliant work will attract enough attention to place it in the categories for many awards it so justly deserves. But more important, it may expose many people to the tragedies that surround us and are too often unnoticed or misunderstood.

In North London there are three families whose houses form a cul-de-sac: Archie (Tim Roth, never better) is a single father whose wife left him to raise 11 year old insulin dependent, adventuresome tomboy Skunk (Eloise Laurence) and her brother Jed (Bill Milner) and their housekeeper Kasia (Zana Marjanovic); The Oswalds  Bob (Rory Kinnear)  is an out of control easily enraged father of three loose and trashy daughters Susan (Rosalie Kosky), Saskia (Faye Daveney) and Sunrise (Martha Bryant); and the Buckleys  Mr. and Mrs. Buckley (Denis Lawson and Clare Burt) and their severely mentally challenged son Rick (Robert Emms). Bob Oswald finds a condom that one of his daughters had been exploring, jumps to the conclusion that Rick has raped his daughter, and beats Rick mercilessly  a sight Skunk witnesses. This cruel error is the first play in the downward spiral of this profoundly sad tale of how these three families interact. There are a few subplots  Kasia is dating a local school teacher Mike (Cillian Murphy) as well as trying to convince Archie to marry her, Skunk is befriended and has her first rocky encounter with a boy named Dillon (George Sargeant) and they find an empty trailer house by the nearby junkyard where massive machines toss old cars around like unwanted bugs, one of the Oswald girls secret pregnancy ends badly, Rick Buckley is blamed for every odd happening and is institutionalized, Skunks friendship with Rick involves her in tragic consequences, and more. Every member of each family is broken in some way and the manner in which these pieces of shattered lives influence each other makes for some of the most profoundly moving scenes and themes ever filmed.

The story is based on the novel by Daniel Clay, adapted for the screen by Mark O'Rowe, and Rufus Norris makes his impressive directing debut. The entire cast is first class  this is the first film experience for Eloise Laurence and she is stunning, as are Tim Roth and Cillian Murphy and the rest. For this viewer this is one of the finest movies of the past year, a film so challenging and exquisitely crafted that it should be seen by everyone. Highly Recommended.

5666913,4,B00BQNSJVC,"`Skunk' is an 11 year old girl living in a nice English neighborhood and then reality sets in.
Her mentally challenged neighbor is savagely beaten by another neighbor after his daughter lied and said she was raped. Skunk sees and experiences some very troubled and violent events, along with contending with her diabetes. We can see some extraordinary acting by this young girl.

This is a 91 minute English film. It has extras with the stars and directors speaking, trailers, and biographies. Sadly there are no subtitles at all. That is always a disappointment especially for films presented to international audiences. There is also a 15 minute short film titled `The Way the World Ends' that is a plotline out of some old Twilight Zones shows.

The main film is hard to watch and a bit extreme in its violence and the effect on Skunk. One longs for those who commit these acts of violence to have some sort of resolution and at times the relationship of the characters becomes muddled; but Skunk is able to pull the attention of the film on her innocence that is rapidly changing.

I was asked to review this DVD and given a copy for examination. The opinion and details written here, are mine alone and were not dictated or ordered.",1383350400,2,1237,4.691244239631336
5666914,5,B00BQNSJVC,"This is one tough movie to watch. Archie (Tim Roth) is separated from his wife who is having an affair with a teacher Mike (Cillian Murphy). Archie's daughter is named Skunk; a 12-year old who is the most innocent observer of the hell at the end of her cul-de-sac. Their next door neighbor Bob, (Rory Kinnear) is a recent widower with a nasty temper trying to raise three similar bullying daughters. Add the other older neighbors, whose son Robert (Rick Buckley) is the mentally challenged adult who has a normal but unfulfilled sexual curiosity. You have a powder keg of a plot.

Bob and his promiscuous daughters assume Robert is a pervert causing Bob to lose control numerous times in viscous assaults on Robert. Archie tries to intervene unsuccessfully with his hands full with his own family. Mike seems to be the common sense teacher who gets pulled into the drama and himself a victim of Bob and his daughters for similar sexual assumptions.

Skunk represents the only nave observer in this suburban madness. Her main concern is handling her diabetes and discovering her crush on a local boy who may be leaving town. Her hopeful anticipation of the future is slowly shattered by the daily dysfunctions of those around her. Director Rufus Norris fills a multitude of complicated characters and issues with an unusual deftness that never confuses. This is the end of the road in many senses. The DVD was provided from 'Film Movements' for an honest and fair review.

Accompanying this DVD is a US short film called ""The Way the World Ends"". It is an odd bird. It begins with a bland slow-paced suburban couple realizing that the sun never came up, yet everything is a shade of `dolphin skin' and the neighbors and coworkers go about business as if nothing happened. The almost comical first part of the film quickly dissolves into a frighteningly sad truth that seems at odds with the original premise. Symbolic and full of metaphors, it's creative, but not a great thrill.",1382918400,,1978,4.794721407624634
5666915,5,B00BQNSJVC,"""Broken"" is not an easily categorized movie. It begins with a scene of intense violence as we are introduced to the three suburban families whose lives will be altered (for worse and better) as the result of what follows. While the issues it addresses are adult ones, it does not do so in a sensational way.

What follows the assault that opens the movie are interwoven tales of love (found and lost, romantic and familial), suspicion, doubt, teenage bullying, illness, health, trust, faith, loss and hope (really). These are wrapped around events in the sphere of pre-teen ""Skunk"". Skunk meticulously tracks her blood test readings as she manages her Type I diabetes and prepares to move into her first year of middle school.

Among those in her orbit are a young adult neighbor (Rick) with indeterminate psychological issues, the Cunningham family (whose three daughters taught Rick mercilessly) and a first-time boyfriend. Skunk's family is rounded out by single father Archie (whose wife has left), her older brother and a live-in nanny, Kazia (whose fiance is about to begin a teaching stint at Skunk's school).

This is a rich plot for mature audiences. Two brief scenes are overtly sexual, and there are multiple instances of actual and implied violence. None are sensational or gratuitous, and all serve to effectively advance the plot.

To reveal many plot details would be to invite spoilers. Just watch this movie in its entirety, because many of its characters act in surprising ways (with a range of good and bad results). And just when director Rufus Norris has you convinced that heartache and bleakness are the only possible outcomes of these events, he pulls us back from the ledge.

A nice break from films centered around formulas and selling toys.

5666916,4,B00BQNSJVC,"Here is another grittily realistic offering from Film Movement.  Skunk is a young girl on the cusp of adolescence, living in a middle class neighborhood in an unnamed British city.  She is a Type 1 diabetic whose mother abandoned her family years earlier, but life with her solicitor father, older brother, and live in nanny is still pleasant enough.  Then one day she witnesses a violent attack by one neighbor on another which sets in motion a series of events that upend her world.

There are multiple story lines in this 90 minute film, many told in flashback or in disconnected fragments that make it very important to pay close attention.  The overall tone is grim, but Skunk's appealing personality does lighten the mood.  In the end  there appears to be no real final resolution, though there are hints  of several pathways the story lines could take

That he has intervened he is now in the sights of those that can do harm and they do.  He is beaten up and accused of the unthinkable. How could this happen?

5666931,5,B00BQNSJVC,"Skunk is eleven years old when she sees one of her neighbours attack another one for apparently no reason. The attacker is the father of three daughters `The Oswald's' and the boy he attacks is the son of the Buckley family and he has `special needs'. Skunk (Eloise Laurence)is the daughter of a local solicitor Archie played by Tim Roth, he has a sort of maid who looks after Skunk and her brother, she is having an on/off affair with friend of the family and newly qualified teacher  Mike Kiernan played by Cillian Murphy.

Mike is soon to start teaching at Skunks school adding a new dimension to their relationship. She has also met a young boy and starts to realise people are not all lightness and light. Meanwhile the Oswald girls are either bullying others, causing violence or being generally unpleasant with their mentally violent father only a step behind to dole out what he sees as street justice. As the lies mount, so does the pressure and an inevitable clash that had me guessing right up until the last.

This is a hard film to watch in places, the violence is visceral, you really feel that they are doing it and the acting is superb. Rory Kinnear as Mr Oswald is just amazingly believable as is Cillian Murphy, but actually everyone of the actors do a brilliant job in what must have been some very difficult scenes to get right. It only lasts for ninety minutes and I said `wow' when it ended, this is the debut directorial venture for actor Rufus Norris and he must have picked up a heck of a lot of tips when he was being directed as he does such an amazing job. I sometimes wonder if I am being generous when I give five stars but in this case it was no competition, easily one of the most engrossing films I have seen for a while - highly recommended indeed.",1375833600,5,1782,4.426829268292683
