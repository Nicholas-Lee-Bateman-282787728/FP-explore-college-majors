2675005,1,B000JJSJ96,"If this film had a message the sound engineer was sure determined to sabotage it. The first rule of any communication - make sure you can be heard and understood.

Lets be honest, the sons of Abraham have been fighting a sibling war over a scrap of desert for over 2000 years. Christ tried to convert them to a loving peaceful philosophy but they considered him a revolutionary and had the Roman Emperors crucify him. If Christ could not succeed, then how will anyone else.

Have you ever thought that these are the two cultures who abuse there every child? If you had your foreskin ripped off without anesthesia by the very people who are supposed to protect you, wouldn't you habour blind anger The foreskin is part of God's creation, it is not a mistake.

The crusades were a very regrettable period of Western History. Part of the Catholic Church's conspiracy to remain the most powerful dominant authority in Europe by engaging Europe in impoverishing wars. G-d did not call for it. G-d's prophets condemned idolatry be it of golden pictures, sculptures or places. G-d is not out there, but here, within us. In our souls. That is what this film utterly failed to reveal.

God does not have soldiers or assassins. God tells us to turn the other cheek.",1191974400,8,1255,4.665158371040724
2675006,4,B000JJSJ96,"It's not Kingdom of Heaven and thankfully so, but this movie is not perfect(really is a 3.5 star movie).  As usual in this day and age when the West continues to be attacked by Muslim fanatics, the Christians and Jews are the bad guys.  As for the DVD, good picture, but I found the dialogue difficult to hear at times - audio recording not the best considering the environment being filmed in?  I found the scene with the Jew attacking the camp confusing - why?  what was the explanation?  It just seemed like a forced scene to cause the Knight to lose it.  Anyway, the actor who played the Knight should have played Orlando Bloom's character in KoH - better looking, more rugged and saltier than Orlando.",1184112000,22,706,4.519685039370079
2675007,5,B000JJSJ96,"This movie may not be for everyone. A serious subject that has been beautifully directed. Hard to believe after reading about the movie to discover that this is the director's first movie, but that's what it says. A particularly important story given the current situation in the Middle East. First saw this movie at the Berkeley Film Festival (where it won best picture) and have since watched it on video. Highly recommend this film.",1178928000,9,435,4.891891891891892
2675008,4,B000JJSJ96,"This is a superb movie that may disturb some people with narrow minds. If you are looking for a movie that elevates one faith above another, look elsewhere. This movie is about the respect and camaraderie that develops between two soldiers of differing religions, who come to the realization of how similar their beliefs truly are.

The writers of this movie have obviously done their homework when it comes to the historical background of the story. In fact, it may help if the viewer also has some knowledge of the historical and political situation amongst which this story is set. Specifically, knowledge of the history of the Knights Templar, as well as the Ismaili sect of Islam would be beneficial. I have not spoken with anyone who has seen this movie but lacks the historical knowledge, so I don't know if this movie would be enjoyable to those who are historically uneducated.

This is a thinking movie, not an action-packed thrill ride. Scenes of battle and carnage are few, and not very graphic. It seems that the intent of the movie was to make viewers evaluate their notions of right and wrong, in particular as it relates to possession of the holy land in the middle ages (and by extension, even today). It also touches on human nature, and how difficult it is to accept who you truly are. I highly recommend this movie to all students of medieval history, and those interested in comparative religious studies.",1174608000,17,1426,4.769230769230769
2675009,4,B000JJSJ96,"Disclaimer: I worked on this film as a stunt man, but that doesn't mean I'm giving it a good review because of that.

The first reviewer is very right... they do make the Christians out to be bad guys, and also the Jews.  It's a little off-putting but the story line is very solid and entertaining.  I was at the world premiere in Los Angeles and I would say 8 or 9 out of 10 people reacted favorably.  I think it's worth seeing at least once.",1172275200,24,443,4.116279069767442

2675011,2,B000JJSJ96,"I kept wondering when the point of the movie would be revealed but it never was.  Great potential and costumes, and the acting was good with what they had to work with, but it badly needed a director and a different story line.",1371427200,2,227,4.27906976744186

2675013,3,B000JJSJ96,The movie is good however there is little action. Lots of conversations regarding many existing issues between Muslims and Christians and the idea of the Holy War.,1329177600,5,163,5.074074074074074

2675015,5,B000JJSJ96,"An Excellent Movie, best I've seen this year (2009). I wish I could find more like this one.
Bill in Las Vegas",1242259200,4,110,4.045454545454546
2675016,1,B000JJSJ96,"1) That scene in the beginning where the ""good guy"" is on the ground about to get killed, but at the last minute he stabs up at the ""bad guy"" who mistakenly thinks he's already won. Wow. Like I haven't seen that sort of scene before.
2) As is typical with many modern films (such as King Arthur too), this film goes out of its way to demonize Christianity. If filmakers and screenwriters want to make films relevant to modern issues, they should focus on the violence within Islamic history. It is in modern Muslim countries that non-Muslims & Muslim women are second-class citizens, and Muslims aren't allowed freedom of religion to convert away from Islam. Those aren't problems in the vast majority of modern Christian countries.
3) It was totally unnecessary to make the Templar knight go into such a gratuitously irrelevant bloodlust at the end.
4) The sound recording was awful. I could be mistaken, but I think I heard Soheila say that she came from Al-Andalus where ""Mamluks"" massacred her family and enslaved her. Newsflash: The Mamluks were never in Spain (Al-Andalus). If I heard wrong, I blame the sound recording.
5) It was very confusing why the Jewish trader was involved in attacking the Templar and the Assassin at the end. Sure Saladin's men would do that, but why the Jewish trader too? First of all, while medieval Jews preferred Muslim rule to Christian rule, I don't think it was that personal for them that one would have gone through the trouble to be part of a band of 4 men attacking a Christian & an Assassin. Also, he was a trader, not a soldier.
6) Muslims are supposed to pray 5 times a day. Why were there constant shots of the Templar praying, but no shots until the very end of the Assassin who travelled with him praying?",1234310400,11,1755,4.610223642172524
2675017,1,B000JJSJ96,This is what you get when you make a film with a tiny budget. You get a tiny little fim.,1234137600,2,88,3.45
2675018,3,B000JJSJ96,"First of all regardless of what other may say as far a historical dramas go ""Soldier of God"" is fairly accurate. As far as Bias well some of the script is a bit cliche in terms west/east Stereotypes. Both sides exhibit arrogance and ignorance of each others society. Example the Ismaili is an assassin and the Templar is
is suffering from ""Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)"".  Both share a common enemy yet neither are aware of it.

Key to understanding the movie is understanding this is set to the background of the Greatest(disastrous) defeat of the European Crusaders at ""The Battle of Hattim"". Opening scenes we are introduced Sir Guy of Lusignan, The Templer Grand Master Gerard of Ridefort and Raynald of Chatillon as the military geniuses (from the low end of the Crusaders gene pool) responsible for the defense of the of Jerusalem. Its not bias to say this was a needless waste of European military resources.  The plot narrows first becoming first a desert survival tale than becomes a ""Bottle Story"" confined to a ""widows"" desert tent (as implausible as that sounds).  Their are inferences and nuances that are easily missed.  We have seen this before in Twilight Zone episodes and a more recent Russian movie ""Prisoner of the Mountain"".

As to the movie itself it has a slow if not plodding pace. Dialogue is often difficult to follow. The leading man Tim Abell, the Templar ""Rene"" is lost in his Rambo like brooding.",1230163200,5,1434,4.83265306122449
2675019,1,B000JJSJ96,"We hoped this would be a redeeming film, but there was nothing redeeming about it.  The knight becomes a homicidal maniac when he sees blood.  From beginning to end, he goes downhill and ultimately destroys everything good in his life.  His Muslim companion is portrayed in a much more positive way.

Unfortunately it is not rated, as the violence and nudity would call for an R rating, and then we would never have purchased it.  We destroyed the disk after watching it and wished we had never seen it.",1213488000,12,503,4.606741573033708
8151425,1,B000JJSJ96,"I think the creators may think they are showing the good/bad on all sides of belief in God, none of which they agree with.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the creators are particularly condemning Christianity.  After all, the Christian emblem covered in blood is all over the opening and closing, and it is flashed in between as well.  Whether picking at one belief or all, I think the creators are angry at God.

Much of the woman's storyline was unrealistic, inconsistent, and of course occasionally gratuitous.  Some random events (desert storm, eclipse) were hard to tell what was happening or how they mattered to the storyline; possibly these were just the creators enjoying some pretty film-making.",1525478400,,718,5.102564102564102

8151428,3,B000JJSJ96,"I honestly thought this was going to be something epic.  As far as historical accuracy goes, it's there, but that's it.  I work for a combat troop that performs full-contact armored fighting, and staged combat, and the owner and his second's characters basically are Rene and Hassan, except with a better ending, and more meat to their stories.  We've all wanted to see this as much as Kingdom of Heaven, and I was over the moon when I finally found it.  Then it all went to hell.  I mean, the acting was fine, the costuming, the characters - what got me was the end.  Good GODS, that was the last thing I was expecting.  Also, there's none of the development and changes in attitude that I had hoped for.  I thought Rene and Hassan would end up on some epic survival story, learn about each other, and become bestest buddies despite everything, rather than just sitting around in some desert lady's tent.  As for the portrayal of good guys/bad guys, they're all portrayed fairly unpleasantly.  The Muslim characters are mostly colder, dismissive, and arrogant toward Rene and Christians/Christianity in general, while either ignoring, or not realizing, the flaws of their own faith and selves that make their arguments a little on the side of hypocritical side - and vice versa.  The leaders of the Christian side, Guy, Renald, and the other generals/important people are every bit as snide and snobbish about the superiority of themselves and their religion.  To a lesser extent, Rene and Hassan are both like this toward each other, though they save each other's lives, and do become not-enemies.  The one Jewish character attacks because he realizes who Hassan is, but rather than be upfront, and right, by warning the desert tent woman, and going to her with his concerns, he keeps his mouth shut while he's a guest, leaves, and then comes back to fight.

In the end, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.  The fighting was sound, and all the technical bits and most of the details were there, but overall, it fell way short.  It's one of those movies you're better off renting, than buying.",1470009600,,2100,4.743801652892562

8151433,3,B000JJSJ96,"I love movies set in medieval times, and there aren't a large number of them. So I definitely gave Soldier of God a watch when I came across it. It's the story of a Templar knight, Rene, who hits a crisis of faith.

Yes, there are a few gory battle scenes, but those hoping for epic Kingdom of Heaven style battles will be disappointed. The few fights here are more about the crazed blood lust that can happen vs any examination of strategy or tactics. Instead, the movie involves a number of discussion between Christians, Jews, Muslims, and other mixed people about the nature of war and land ownership. This might be thrilling to some - and tediously boring to others.

What makes it even more challenging - for a movie based primarily on dialogue - is that the sound is poorly done and often it's incredibly hard to hear what they are saying. I had to crank up the sound to be able to make out some of the scenes. That then makes the battle-type of noises blastingly loud.

One of the features of this movie are the gorgeous landscapes - but then it's incredibly depressing to read this was mostly filmed in California with some scenes in Spain. If I'm  hoping to be swept away by beautiful scenery, I want it to actually be the scenery of the place featured in the film. Not somewhere completely unrelated.

Finally, the ending just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie. It's like it was tacked on to make a point. I can't really say more without giving away spoilers.

I'll give it some credit for attempting to tackle an important topic, and to show a counterpoint to the many, many ""Christians were great for stomping the infidels"" movies that exist. But surely we are beyond the point where we have to swing to the other side of ""Christians are evil and Jews are deceitful"" - I'd have appreciate it more if it they had a bit more balance.

So, in the end, I liked the topic. I liked some of the acting. I liked the scenery - but was disappointed it was all fake. And there was a lot wrong here that should have been fixable.",1411257600,,2042,4.372031662269129
