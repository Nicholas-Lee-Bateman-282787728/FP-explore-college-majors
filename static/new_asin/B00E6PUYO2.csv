5893609,4,B00E6PUYO2,"An unconventional plot and riveting performances combine in this drama of obsession, loneliness, and perversity.  It was hard to watch yet I couldn't turn away.  The boy half of a troubled 17-year-old set of twins is drawn into a relationship with a somewhat older man, himself deeply disturbed but outwardly successful.  Though ""unconditional love"" is promised, it was actually full of conditions and short of love.",1403827200,4,416,5.2727272727272725
5893610,1,B00E6PUYO2,"Really, unconditional love? There should be a part two, and the lead character
gets taken down for statutory rape. This is a sad story about exploitation.",1403308800,2,154,4.961538461538462
5893611,5,B00E6PUYO2,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was very different and disturbing in parts, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The acting was superb.  If you're in the mood for something different and spellbinding, watch this-you won't be disappointed.",1402272000,3,233,5.27027027027027
5893612,4,B00E6PUYO2,"Christian Cooke conjugates both psychosis and charm in a film that is less a thriller, and more a vicarious exploration of identity.",1401926400,3,132,5.045454545454546
5893613,2,B00E6PUYO2,"Despite the fact that the storyline is completely different, this movie reminded me of the films: The Reader, Doubt and 9  Weeks.  Similar to The Reader and Doubt, the movie deals with a subject that is often not dealt with in polite company  I can see how it might spark thought and conversation after viewing it. Similar to 9 1/2 Weeks, one character's wants engulf the personhood of the other character and the relationship.

Though the actors gave outstanding performances in crucial scenes, I was not drawn into the story or curious about the films outcome which is in many ways a foregone conclusion; abuse relationships generally follow the same path. There are only a few ways that the relationships resolve.  To me, the movie is dark, tedious and creepy, bordering on sinister.

If you don't mind a movie that delves into the oppressive side of seduction, disparity of status, homosexuality and codependency without a moral center; then you may find this film worthwhile.  I did not.  The only reason why I watched it until the end was to give it a fair review.

Some details, you might want to know:
- The pivotal relationship in the film is between a gender bending, older, gay man and a teen boy, set in the UK.  The teen twin sister has little to do with the main storyline.
- If you use closed caption, which you may need because of their thick accents, note: it is out of synch with the dialogue in large sections
-The movie is NR but if it were rated it would likely be R for subject matter, language and a sex scene",1397347200,18,1532,4.538181818181818
5893614,5,B00E6PUYO2,I have to say that this film struck a chord that I never expected. From the moment it began its well crafted and artistic twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting is off the charts. The Cinematography/Direction is breathtaking. The story is heart breaking and profound. I found it truly fearless as it dives into a young man's vulnerable world as he questions EVERYTHING. I love this film!!,1379894400,,409,4.54054054054054
5893615,5,B00E6PUYO2,"Unconditional Love is a riveting film and an example of how incredible independently made films can be. I first saw it at Slamdance and had to see it again when it opened in LA. It's so gripping and uncomfortable at times, yet I couldn't turn away, laughed out loud, and can't stop talking about it months after the fact. Christian Cooke and Harry McEntire give realistic and raw performances so true to the characters that they are worthy of many more awards than they've already garnered. I highly recommend this film. You won't think about anything other than the film while watching it and you'll have amazing conversations afterward!",1379635200,,638,4.862385321100917
5893616,5,B00E6PUYO2,"I LOVE this film!  What an original out of the box story about a complicated, unconventional and sometimes disturbing relationship! Christian Cooke is just amazing as a very charismatic, yet lost soul. It left me speechless!  If you like films that push the boundaries, Unconditional Love is for you!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unconditional-Love/dp/B00E6PUYO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unconditional Love</a>",1379635200,,458,7.622641509433962

5893620,2,B00E6PUYO2,"What should be an intrigue turns into a fuddled mess... Poor twins, a boy and girl, attract the attention of a well-off young businessman whose intentions are more twisted than erotic. Though the girl halls in mad crush on him, and he seems initially to reciprocate, it is the boy he wants. Only he only wants the boy as a girl, a girl who has his twin sister's name.
Psychologically abusive, perhaps, the tension never lands where it's intended -- and mostly its a ghastly mish-mash of notions someone must've thought provocative, but are more awkward and cringe-inducing.
The poster has a definite frisson -- and the title, a promise that is anything but made good upon.
Only as something to laugh at for its lunkish notion of eroticism, maybe. Beyond that -- and that's a stretch, not so much.",1413072000,,796,4.692857142857143

5893625,5,B00E6PUYO2,Unusual story about an assassin who feels true passion for the first time in many years with the woman he is hired to kill. This is an interesting twist for both the assassin and the woman who becomes the objector his desire.,1407110400,,225,4.380952380952381
5893626,1,B00E6PUYO2,"Glanced at it and found it boring.
I am not big on movies about homosexualty so I just skipped around.
If you skip to the end like I did, the last song in the soundtrack is not bad.",1406764800,,181,3.789473684210526

8602155,5,B00E6PUYO2,"A courageous effort to explore the subject of gender and sexuality, written and acted powerfully.  A regret is that films involving the subject of transgender, as here, often have an element of obsession or perversity.  The film does not have to to be anything other than it is, but it would be good to see a film where the relationship evolves into something healthy and happy.",1456531200,,378,4.712121212121212
8602156,4,B00E6PUYO2,"This is the kind of movie that, given the subject matter, a person could either be repulsed by it or fascinated with it (or some combination of the two).  But I don't understand how one reviewer concluded that all of the supporting characters seemed to be OK with the sexually perverse relationship between the young man and the boy (who told another character in the film that he was 17).  The boy's sister was clearly concerned about the relationship, began to think that it might be abnormal, and tried to find out what exactly the nature of it was.  The boy's mother clearly didn't know what was going on between the man and the boy and so I don't know how one reviewer concluded that all of the supporting characters seemed OK with the relationship.  But, whatever, the story held my interest and I thought Christian Cooke was great in the very complex role of the young man in the man-boy relationship.",1435881600,,908,4.58641975308642
8602157,5,B00E6PUYO2,good drama,1424563200,,10,4.5
8602158,1,B00E6PUYO2,"This film attempts to probe into the psyche of two misfit 17 year old twins (brother and sister) who come into contact with a 20 something ""financial advisor"" who brings his own baggage to the ""party"".  The young girl immediately takes a shine to the ""older"" young man (Liam) who actually has the hots for her twin - except that he demands that the twin (Owen) dress up like a young girl when they finally do hook up. There is only one major condition. Liam, who purportedly is not homosexual but certainly sexually disoriented, demands ""unconditional love"" from Owen. My reading is that he subconciously demands ""unconditional sex"" providing that Liam dress up like a girl.  Owen obliges Liam at first while his twin is left alone with her own desires.  But, as the relationship between the two young men evolves, things become more complicated and uncertain. Without giving anything away, this misguided affair becomes as confusing as the gender bending that keeps it going.  The end result to all this seems so abrupt that the viewer may well ask: ""What was that all about?""  What is lacking is a background story of any substance to help us understand why Liam or even Owen for that matter would prefer such a relationship.  Is it just a lack of maturity? Is it a matter of need?  Is it due to a purely psychological problem that is never really explained?  In any event, the final denouement is a 180 degree shift that will also leave the viewer asking him/herself: ""What the...!""  The problem with this film has nothing to do with the acting which is quite good.  Christian Cooke as Liam is an excellent actor (""Trinity"", ""Demons"", ""Magic Town"", ""The Promise"")  some of whose credits are also linked to those of the director. He gives a very credible performance here as well.  The fault is in the script and general story line which never goes below the surface and, in the end, turns the real meaning of ""Unconditional Love"" on its head.",1420848000,,1945,4.688235294117647
