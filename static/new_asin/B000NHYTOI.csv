8177733,4,B000NHYTOI,"Just purchased the dvd, for my son, who is being bullied in high school. will come back and tell you how it worked out for him, once I receive it, unable to give a full review at this time, heard good review about this dvd, and using the tactics on someone who is smaller, and defenseless. My son's bully is a ""jock"", and much taller than him, and he/my son isn't a fighter. And he doesn't believe in violence, cause he is a Christian, I told him, sometimes, u just have to defend yourself, from bad people. Hopefully he will listen and this will stop.............smh",1480032000,,567,4.40952380952381
8177734,4,B000NHYTOI,IF you want to know how to feel secure if a big bully is going to act stupid - take a lesson from Bob Taylor.  I've met the man - he is intense. This guy is no bodies dance partner unless he is leading:-) What ever brought you hear is enough to look up another REAL DIY kinda guy - Kelly Worden. I have several of his videos and plan to get a few more. He too is no nonsense and very efficient.  That's why I bought Bob Taylor he is an efficient practitioner not a song and dance man. Well worth the money.,1351987200,,506,3.855769230769231
