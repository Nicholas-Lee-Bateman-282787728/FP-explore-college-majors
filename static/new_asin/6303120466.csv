590824,5,6303120466,"Green Mansions is a strange novel, by William Henry Hudson, and this film captures the strange illustrated edition of the novel very well. It is extremely camp, and Mel Ferrer as a director here is terrible, and Sesu Hayakawa as an Amazonian native is absurd, but Audrey Hepburn captures Rima The Bird Woman to perfection, and she looks stunning, and acts with great style and belief so that you don't care about the others...Anthony Perkins is likable, but stiff, and he clearly is waiting for Psycho...
Get this film if you love Audrey, and especially for her ability to counter bad scripts and direction and miscast fellow actors, and to take you away into her own Green Mansion for a lovely time.",977961600,31,700,4.745901639344262

The script is horrible, the acting is cheesy, and even though Audrey was an enchanting woman, even she couldn't do much to make up for this poor film.  It was so ridiculous it made me laugh.  And Audrey's hair (which I'm sure was a wig) looked funny.  Was her husband (Mel Ferrer,the director) trying to destroy her career?",977011200,3,457,4.329411764705882
590826,2,6303120466,"I am one of Audrey's greatest fans, but this film was really bad. Any real critic will tell you so. It was directed by her then husband Mel Ferrer and eventually contributed to the break up of their marriage. It is too bad, not even the charm of Audrey as Rima, the wood spirit could save this doomed picture from box-office failure and it even damaged her career considerably. I hate to be so harsh, but it is the truth. I would only recommend this movie to you if you love the story or simply think that Audrey is worth watching through this poorly scripted and directed movie. I gave this two stars because some of the photography was nice and of course allowances must be made to Miss Hepburn.",975196800,9,697,4.369230769230769

Years later, I came across a 1944 edition of the book, Green Mansions, and fell in love  all over again. Since then I've read and reread the book and watched and  rewatched the movie.  I now have to replace the movie, since I've worn it  out.  I may not be a movie critic and I don't always agree with their  assessment of certain movies. But, I do know what I love.

590925,4,6303120466,Considered something of a disappointment when theatrical released I saw it twice during its first run showing. I enjoyed Audrey Hepburn and thought at the time that the mystic love story and setting were quite fascinating. I had not seen it since then and was glad that WB on demand made it available. GREEN MANSION was announced as a production several times over the years only to be dropped from the production schedule. Mel Ferrer (who directed) felt that this would be suited to his wife Audrey Hepburn and she is fine in the part. The film is not great but it is certainly worth while for anyone serious about the work of Hepburn. It's also nice to see Audrey working with a leading man not old enough to be her father. Anthony Perkins does a fine job and the settings are quite striking.,1407715200,4,794,4.520833333333333

Yes, it's meant to be a fantasy, and it isn't the typical blood and gore film that seems to populate today's box office.

590968,5,6303120466,"I'm reviewing this based on the film alone- as i have not read the book [though i have it on my bookshelf to read list].

I believe the negative reviews are because, this isn't your usual audrey film. As an Audrey fan i can relate to why many would have been disappointed. However, when i first saw this film on television some years ago i had no idea who was starring in it, i went into it with no expectations and ended up really enjoying it's unusual story line. I think it's actually grown on me as one of my favorite audrey role's simply because its so out of her usual script, and her performance is subtle, but i think her scenes are what really draw you in. Yes the story line is a bit odd- but when you read a synopsis with the words bird woman what do you expect [ i've always supposed this is because it was a book and many times books narrate information that explains characters and symbolism more in depth then a screen performance, which is why this has been on my to read list for a while].

All that aside! perhaps it is a strangely written romance/drama. BUT, If you feel you are a real audrey fan don't deprive yourself of seeing another dimension of her performing ability simply because you prefer your Audrey in a more refined role, there are still many things to appreciate here.

On a side Note: My favorite Audrey Film is Charade...Followed by How to Steal a Million, My Fair Lady, and Funny Face... and many more",1336867200,3,1438,4.338289962825279
590969,1,6303120466,"If you spend more than $1.00 for this movie I feel bad for you. It's quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have read all the cover-words like ""dreamlike"", ""hypnotic"" ""lush"" ""romantic"" when ""nightmare"" might be more appropriate. The acting is wooden in the extreme, the costumes a cross between business casual and Gilligens Island. Poor Lee J Cobb comes across like a Martha Graham tableau. What a silly, pitiful waste of 3 great careers. The only redeeming part was finding out what a gorgeous physique Henry Silva has. The ""trial by wasp"" was good camp fun.  I can truly say the only character that was in the least engaging was the poor pooch. Unless you would like your memory of the principals' sullied for all time skip this turkey.",1333497600,2,756,4.6
590970,4,6303120466,"I was scared after many people wrote not very good things about this movie. Its maybe not the best movie but interesting and entertaining. With my snake-phobia I was shocked at one scene.

The movie beginns mysterious, Anthony Perkins character enter in a mysterious world, a mysterious forest (and the jungle can be very mysterious).

I enjoyed very much the movie. The art decors / jungle looks great. Henry Silva is perfect for his role and also I liked Anthony Perkins (at this time 27 years, 3 years younger than his Co-Star Audrey Hepburn).

The DVD

The picture quality looks very good. So much better than I have expected for a not restored/remastered movie!
The Sound: very good too in STEREO - Bronislau Kapers score sounds great.

The only one and biggest MINUS point I have: NO SUBTITLES for deaf hearing people, so its a little bit difficult for me to understand every word.

TRIVIA: this was the first Hollywood movie shot in PANANVISION!!!",1305763200,29,954,4.786585365853658
590971,3,6303120466,"One day it occurred to me to wonder why no film had ever been made based upon Green Mansions, the book by W. H. Hudson first published in 1916, which seemingly would lend itself so well to the production of a gorgeous movie.  I looked and was able to discover that a movie was made in 1959 by Mel Ferrer, starring Audrey Hepburn as Rima, the bird girl, and Anthony Perkins as Abel, narrator of the written story, who falls in love with this tragically-fated female figment of the verdant jungle ""mansions.""  Abel is initially an angry young man in search of gold with which to avenge the politically-motivated death of his father and whose character is ""converted"" to love when he encounters Rima.  The movie is filmed partly on site in Venezuela, where the action of the original story takes place, chiefly in the jungles.

I think the reason I never heard of the movie is because it must have been a failure with the public.  It was, I would say, about 75% a failure with me when I bought it on VHS and viewed it.  Hardly any of the depth of naturalistic sensibility or lyrical beauty conveyed by the narrator of the written story is evident in the portrayal of the movie Abel.  Perkins seems at first to be little more than a vengeful hot-head who isn't really at all likable.  Perkins over-acts the angry part.  Later, Perkins does better.  Abel becomes gentle and fairly sympathetic as a young swain in love.  His ""nerves,"" which are a salient feature of the character portrayed by Perkins, are more settled, and he has grown less and less consumed by vindictive emotions, but he never becomes a character evocative of the highly intelligent and sensitive narrator of the novel who wrote such passages as the following:

""As the sun went down over the ridge, beyond the savannah, the whole western sky changed to a delicate rose-colour that had the appearance of rose-coloured smoke blown there by some far-off wind, and left suspended---a thin, brilliant veil showing through it the distant sky beyond, blue and ethereal.  Flocks of birds were flying past me overhead, uttering as they flew a clear, bell-like chirp; and there was something ethereal too in those drops of melodious sound, which fell into my heart like raindrops falling into a pool to mix their fresh heavenly water with the water of earth....Doubtless, into the turbid tarn of my heart some sacred drops had fallen--from the passing birds, from that crimson disc which had now dropped below the horizon, the darkening hills, the rose and blue of infinite heaven, from the whole visible circle; and I felt purified and had a strange sense and apprehension of a secret innocence and spirituality in nature--a prescience of some bourn, incalculably distant perhaps, to which we are all moving; of a time when the heavenly rain shall have washed us clean from all spot and blemish.  This unexpected peace which I had found now seemed to me of infinitely greater value than that yellow metal I had missed finding, with all its possibilities.  My wish now was to rest for a season in this spot, so remote and lovely and peaceful, where I had experienced such unusual feelings, and such a blessed disillusionment.""

The first major things in the movie that felt really ""wrong"" to me about the production, besides Perkins' over-acting, were that we hear Rima singing invisibly (too long) some very peculiar bird songs in the jungle, but we never see her producing these incredible and none-too-harmonious sounds, and throughout the entire movie, we never even see her moving among the tree-tops but always walking at ground level.

No other actress that I know of could have been so perfect in appearance to play Rima.  Audrey's lithe figure and enchanting face are almost unearthly and so they easily suggest the spiritual and bird-like elements that are a part of Rima's character.  Nevertheless, despite Audrey's ethereal grace as a nature sprite here, she also looks inappropriately sophisticated.  Her neatly-groomed long hair with bangs, her flawless lightly-applied make-up, her correct-English speech when she does finally talk, and her domestic skills focusing upon carding wool and sewing, all bespeak implausible civilized elements that don't seem to fit the situation.  She has been adopted as a very small child by her ""grandfather,"" a former bandit, and it hardly seems likely she would have become such a ""finished"" young woman under his tutelage.  Her angry and changeable attitudes to her grandfather, the way she emotionally turns against him several times for no good reasons and tries to call down condemnation from heaven upon him, make her again implausible--or else too excitable--and not very sympathetic.

Lee J. Cobb's part as the grandfather is over-acted with exaggerated mannerisms of woe, disapproval, distress, what-have-you.  Even so, he does manage to be a sympathetic character toward the end of the movie.  Sessu Hayakawa and the other Indian characters remind me of the simplistic sort of ""savages"" portrayed in old Tarzan films or Saturday serials.

Some of the natural beauty of the South American settings is definitely evident, but most of the action seems to take place on phony-looking sets where the jungle environment is recreated in an unconvincing way.  I noticed something like a claustrophobic atmosphere about these sets.

Overall, the film gave me the feeling of a ""Grade B"" movie.  Except for the refined beauty and magical presence of Audrey Hepburn, who really did not seem to belong on that mediocre film set, there was a general amateurishness about the picture.

I wish someone would make a really sensitive and excellent version of Green Mansions, especially now that the general public is taking seriously issues that relate to naturalism, the environment, and the necessity to respect and care for what is left of our ""Edens.""  With the right direction/ production/ acting/ photography, the themes in this movie could easily symbolize such concerns to a great and effective extent.  The book itself, being a masterpiece of creative beauty, deserves a masterful visual exponent of like quality.",1305331200,7,6118,4.985250737463127
590972,3,6303120466,"a fairy tale ? a love story ? a romantic drama ? an adventure movie ? a rainforest documentary ? HOW COULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS FILM ? WELL, YOU CAN'T !!!!!
Mel FERRER, who never was such a great actor, is even worse as a director, so this strange project was doomed from the start. It takes a lot of talent to bring to the screen such an elusive and poetic story, even Vincente MINNELLI who gave it a try as a musical in the early 50'S soon found it impossible to shoot, especially on location in South America.
However, with the help of the talented Joseph RUTTENBERG, a top cinematographer at MGM ( remember ""BRIGADOON"" ?)and the amazing job of recreating a tropical jungle in CULVER CITY, the film is most of the time visually beautiful, if not perfect. Forget Sessue HAYAKAWA as an indian, Lee J. COBB, overacting as usual, and a too clean and boring Anthony PERKINS, picking up a guitar and romancing....AUDREY (Yes !!)

SHE is the real star of the show, and 52 years after, dressed in a potatoe bag (Probably GIVENCHY !)she still shines through the film. Of course, she was too old for the part, but who else could play RIMA back in 1958 ? MARYLIN ? LIZ ? AVA ? KIM ?",1289347200,13,1171,4.322727272727272

Audrey's forte was always looking stylish in her role, with cutting edge fashions.  The only cutting edge used in this movie was to make the holes in the flour sack she wears for the whole movie.  This, coupled with her bare feet, makes the whole thing look like a remake of Lil Abner in South America without the music.

As far as the plot goes, it's pretty thin, and awfully muddled.  Audrey spends most of the movie making goo-goo eyes at Tony Perkins (who is supposed to be from South America, and yet has no accent at all) and putting curses on her Grandfather.

Even the locations are inconsistent.  Part of the movie seems to take place in a rain forest, and then toward the end, seems to be in the desert southwest.

Mel Ferrer, who was Audrey's husband at the time, directed this clunker.  I wonder if he were trying to destroy her career?  I'm sure it didn't help her any.",1266451200,4,1071,4.331658291457287

 Audrey Hepburn is Beautiful as always and exhibits an ethereal innocense appropriate to the character. I can't visualize any modern actress I know of being able to pull this off in this post-womans lib era.(can you imagine any of them playing a virgin??!). The music is wonderful. I remember a haunting leitmotive(a melody associated with her character) that reminded me of French composer Claude Debussy.

590997,2,6303120466,"Many bright, talented artists (and Mel Ferrer) came a cropper with this inert misfire.  Hudson's novel was probably unadaptable during the studio-bound 50's -- perhaps now, with the current emphasis on location and a suitably ethnic cast, a more satisfactory version could emerge, though in any period the mystic aspects of the narrative would be tricky to manage properly.  But the MGM treatment, while a labor of love for the Ferrers, produced one of Hepburn's few flops, seemingly doomed from the start -- any film that prominently features Anthony Perkins, Audrey Hepburn, and a fawn is just too twee for most mere mortals.  In fairness, Hepburn gives Rima the old college try, but (as in THE UNFORGIVEN) her refined diction does her in.  Between her finishing school vowels and her innate chic, this child of the jungle would fit perfectly in Mayfair.  Even Audrey's simple linen shift, on her, looks like the hautest couture.  Dorothy Kingsley's dialogue doesn't help much -- this is the kind of movie where savages, noble or otherwise, don't seem to have yet discovered contractions.  Throw in a wasted supporting cast (although Hayakawa and Henry Silva frequently lend their native hut the air of a particularly louche bar in Tijuana), futile attempts by Katherine Dunham and Villa Lobos to elevate the proceedings, a strong contender for Most Ludicrous Title Song Ever, warbled by Perkins, and you've got a real curate's egg.  Too earnest for camp, perhaps GREEN MANSIONS' main point of interest for today's Hepburn fans is that, in many of the more successful moments of her work as Rima (her speeches to her late mother and her final love scene with Perkins, for instance), you can get a pretty fair idea of what her Tony-winning Broadway turn as Giradoux's Ondine must have been like.

She is being hunted by the local Indian tribesmen for being an evil spirit, but she is protected first by her grandfather Nuflo and then by Abel, a young political refugee whom she rescues after he is bitten by a deadly coral snake. The slowly-paced story initially focuses on Abel's hazardous journey into the jungle with Joseph Ruttenberg's cinematography nicely capturing the authentic Amazon locations.

Rima shows up as a shadowy figure about a half-hour into the film and doesn't speak until about ten minutes later. Leave it to Hepburn to exhibit any sort of conviction in such an implausible role. Looking ethereal if a little too styled and coiffed (even without Givenchy) and sounding entirely too Euro-cosmopolitan, she still exudes Rima's innocence while discovering the darker secrets of her past. The rest of the cast is not as lucky. Anthony Perkins, a year away from ""Psycho"", is irritatingly unctuous as Abel when he is not simply confounded by his heroic role. His low point has to be the ridiculous scene when he sings a love song to Rima as he strums his guitar. And where exactly did the guitar come from?

Familiar character actors show up in the oddest roles. Lee J. Cobb, heavily made up as a cross between Uncle Jesse Duke and Santa Claus, turns in yet another ham-fisted performance as Nuflo, and Henry Silva is cast as another exotic as the ultimately nefarious tribal leader. Nehemiah Persoff has a small bit at the beginning as a greedy trader, while Sessue Hayakawa, of all people, has a mostly silent role as the tribal leader. Adding to the artifice is the obvious use of soundstages and matte shots to replicate the jungle, and the ending is pure Hollywood sappiness. This is a curio for Hepburn fans.",1156032000,10,2035,4.861671469740634
590999,4,6303120466,"We are in presence of a film that at least, it dared to challenge the delicate issue; civilization against enrooted ancestral beliefs, whose fate has been previously decreed and the lead man, of renovated ideas.

The film had dated but still conserves the interpretative vigor of Anthony Perkins and the well known sweetness of Audrey Hepburn who looks like more an angel than a Bird Girl.

Original in its purpose.",1155859200,3,415,4.914285714285715
591000,2,6303120466,"A very disappointing Audrey Hepburn offering. Married to Mel Ferrer(director)who was still captivated by her beauty at the time, Audrey probably nixed filming on-location, which doomed this turn-of-the-century yarn from realizing its potential. The doe, Audrey,Tony Perkins and a fake snake could not liven the stagey jungle drama. State-of-the-art effects, on-location filming with Keira Knightley in the lead,perhaps, would bring this charming yarn to fruition. The W.H. Hudson book still charms.",1141689600,4,498,6.028169014084507

591002,2,6303120466,"This movie could not be pulled off even with Audrey Hepburn. I am an ardent Audrey Hepburn fan but, the script was terrible and so was some of the acting. I hate to say it but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have not read the book but, from what I have heard the movie does not do the book justice. By the end of the movie I was actually glad it was over unlike many of Hepburn's other movies. I only gave it 2 stars because it is a Audrey Hepburn film.",1107907200,6,472,3.7777777777777777
591003,3,6303120466,"This film won't hold the interest of many viewers unless you are dedicated Audrey Hepburn fans. The pace is slow, the characters are rather unconvincing, and the entire plot is a little stiff. On a more positive note, Audrey is charming and beautiful as the mysterious bird girl, and the cinematography is breathtaking. The scenes with the natives are pretty good, and the tribal dance scenes are effectively disturbing. Anthony Hopkins is cute, but there wasn't much of a spark onscreen between his character and Audrey's, which made the love story a bit unconvincing. Overall, worth a look at least once if you love Audrey Hepburn or want to see the film adaption of the novel.",1086307200,8,679,4.862068965517241
591004,5,6303120466,"If you're a fan of the book by William Henry Hudson, this film version of ""Green Mansions"" is a must.  It brings to life extremely well the natural and simple beauty of the story, and of Audrey Hepburn, of course.  Perkins is a marvelous Abel to Hepburn's Rima, the two together making the story blossom into one of those very little-known films that everyone should see, or at least hear of.  Granted, the script is terrible, but the actors pull it off so effortlessly that the magic just shines right through.  I highly recommend this film whether you love Audrey Hepburn, Anthony Perkins, William Henry Hudson's book, or are just looking for one of those magical films that never grows old.",1075248000,9,693,4.702479338842975

It has a great storyline and is really unique.  It's a film well worth seeing.",1051920000,9,335,4.741379310344827
591006,4,6303120466,This movie has been badly maligned but it has many redeeming points-Audrey is the only Rima that could ever be and Anthony Perkins was actually believable as a nineteenth century hero. The most enjoyable part of the film is the wonderful scenery and luscious photography. Some of the shots are quite amazing!  The biggest problem is the change of ending from the book. I think it changes direction a little too fast. But if you like Hollywood endings-it's fine. The directing is average-what is interesting is the level of comfort which Audrey seemed to project during the film. That could have been the result of working with a husband whom she did truly love.  I recommend this movie to people who are looking for a feast for the senses-I think you'll find it!,997142400,37,762,4.7218045112781954

7840410,4,6303120466,"If you love Audrey Hepburn we will forgive the screen writer and director for not making Rima as mysterious and ethereal as she was in the novel. You must admit audrey is pretty ethereal in this film, and who would not fall in love with this gentle and beautiful creature from the jungle? These are not yet the days where this bird girl can be cinematically turned into a bird girl as we see in Avatar. It is done reasonable well and faithfully follows key aspects of the novel, with the exception of this dreamy ending where Audrey and Perkins (Abel) join hands and go off into the sunset. In the movie Rima appears to have died as in the novel, but her spirit lives in the heart and mind of Abel as he returns to civilization. Nobody will ever make this movie so let's all be glad that we have a decent memorable version with great scenery juxtaposed with simple staged jungle setting, some descent believable indigenous tribe interactions, a decent grandfather in the great Cobb and a damn good romance with Audrey and Perkins.

7840416,4,6303120466,"I watched this film when it first came out; I was 10 years old and my mom loved Audrey Hepburn. I saw it again on TCM, and decided it was a film I wanted to have. Very strange, and an unusual performance from the beloved Audrey. It was directed by her (then) husband, Mel Ferrer, who really wasn't a very good director, and based on a long novel by William Henry Hudson. What Ferrer did right was to make the landscape a character unto itself. Anthony Perkins was somewhat of a newcomer, and was OK and Lee J Cobb was good as Rima's (Hepburn) caretaker. In 1958, there weren't a whole lot of films about the Amazon and native tribes. It resonated with me over all those years.

Not great, but not bad. Some scenes were filmed on location.",1460160000,4,738,4.309352517985611
