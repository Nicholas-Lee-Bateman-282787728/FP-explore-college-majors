8357612,1,B00299AP7I,"I had always used just a cleaning tape for VHS. Put it in, run it for a few seconds and its done. I didn't realize what I was getting here, having to fill with ink and it takes awhile to run through. Tapes worked for a short while and had to use again. Not sure if it is the tape player or this cleaning tape.",1347926400,2,309,3.769230769230769
