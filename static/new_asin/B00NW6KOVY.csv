6682260,5,B00NW6KOVY,"An alternate timeline, humanity has met its first alien encounter - and its first interplanetary war.  the relentless BETA (Beings of Extra Terrestrial Adversity) took over the moon and in 1973 landed in Asia.  Humanity fights a losing war of attrition using new weapons called TSF's.  The story starts with a young Japanese girl named Yui, a soldier trainee, and her first contact with this unstoppable force - and the horrors she experiences on the field.  Then a few years later she is part of a group development team to make new weapons and train new pilots to try to push back the BETA hoard.  But the squad is a little unorthodox, and the main pilot in her opinion a loose cannon - but with the right training could they possibly be able to turn the war around.

I just finished the first 13 episodes on Crunchyroll, and it was good.  the first episodes give you the history with the rest about the Argos squad and the problems with trying to work with other countries.  You can see not only tension, but the problems politics and fear brings out against an enemy that has no interest in talking - just destroying.  I give this a must have - and will wait for the next season as the war is only just beginning.",1413504000,20,1217,4.445945945945946
6682271,5,B00NW6KOVY,"To be honest, I was more a fan of the mecha here until I noticed they actually made an anime!  Not disappointed.  The mecha work well for the CGI they are done in at the time.  Character designs are good and the PVC statues they have done are excellent!  Good to have!",1432944000,,268,4.096153846153846

This show is all over the map.  It starts out looking like a grim series where earth has been invaded and humanity is being overrun and in danger of being exterminated.  Mecha pilots are being slaughtered in combat against the aliens.  Then it switches to a ""Top Gun academy"" show where pilots from different countries are competing against each other.  It briefly heads towards harem series territory, then winds up with the mecha pilots all banding together against an attack by religious terrorists on their base.  The aliens that were so overwhelming in the first couple of episodes somehow got downgraded to a nuisance that had to be cleaned up by the end of the series.

Come on fellow anime fans.  Nearly every series has about a 4.5 rating on Amazon.  Does everybody REALLY think all anime series are great, or is it just that only the big fans of a show post reviews about it?",1498608000,,897,4.662420382165605
8680670,5,B00NW6KOVY,This is a Great Anime Series. This is the first collection of the series episodes 1-12 and Muv-Luv Alternative Total Eclipse 2 is the second collection and I recommend watching both of them. This items description on the page paints a really good pitcher of the story line of Aliens (BETA) VS. Mecha (Tactical Surface Fighter or TSF) So be ready for some surprises along the way that will have you wanting to watch more!  So who will survive??,1489622400,,443,4.6075949367088604
8680671,5,B00NW6KOVY,"Package is already in my city before i even knew it the day i bought Muv Luv Alternate Total Eclipse part 1. Then it shipped with in 3 hours of being purchased again standard shipping. Btw the series is a must watch it's absolutely amazing in all departments being a huge mecha fan like me. The story is well thought out and developed I'm actually sad i didn't know this came out in 2012 now just recently finished. Apart from the game the story actually left off with a huge cliffhanger which it actually needs a second season there's so much left to do in the story. Correct me if I'm wrong there are light novels or a manga on the story that progresses further i haven't looked into it much but I'm going too.

Overall it's a Solid 10.",1483747200,,738,4.271428571428571
8680672,4,B00NW6KOVY,"Very fun Science Fiction alien invasion vs. Mecha story.  Very gory and violent, the manga of this series actually inspired the creator of Attack on Titan.  Based on a videogame series in Japan.  Check it out!",1469232000,,209,4.75

8680674,2,B00NW6KOVY,I really wanted to like this anime but the writing was just too bad. It starts as though it was going to be awesome but soon falls flat. The dramatic moments seem to just be so poorly timed. It's like standing in the road until a car gets close enough for you to dramatically jump away.,1451260800,,286,4.125
8680675,5,B00NW6KOVY,Very good DVD lot of action. I have buy it for my collection of 2056!,1447372800,,69,3.6666666666666665
8680676,3,B00NW6KOVY,"You must not watch this anime seriously .
Of course , creaters may have tried to make this profound.
But you can't help ridiculing in watching .
The song of this anime , which the Japanese bitch singer sings, is very teribble.
Once you hear it , it will remain in your brain for a long time.
This anime is never masterpiece.
So I recommend that you watch it with your friends laughing at the story.",1445990400,,398,4.25
