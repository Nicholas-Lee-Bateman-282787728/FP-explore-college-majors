2254971,5,B000803BQM,My children loved it. My husband and I love it. I think it a very good family movie. I think that some single man might just under stand what a father is. And maybe they'll think twice before date a women with kids. It was a heart warming movies. And maybe this movie would give us a open mind on life and the feelings of other. And maybe this way they won't be so many fatherless children out there.my husband even changes a little with our kids. I think it because what he saw in this heart warming movie. It might not as funny as you think but it haves values.and there is a message in the movie . Just watch the kids,1106524800,7,620,4.048780487804878
2254972,1,B000803BQM,"I've only seen the trailer and to me, this looks like a dumb kids movie. Also, thief, thief, thief!!! In the trailer, Ice Cube is standing in the middle of the road. It looks like he's going to be hit my a truck because two headlights are coming right towards him. It turns out the headlights were from two motorcycle that passed him on each side. Buster Keaton did that in one of his shorts. Much funnier, in my opinion, when the great stone face did it.",1105142400,7,455,4.241379310344827
2254973,4,B000803BQM,"The first time I seen this movie, I really enjoyed watching it!  In fact......I'm still telling everybody that hasn't seen it......to see it.  I just don't understand why they set the story line as a ""New Years"" setting....rather than a ""Christmas"" setting.  (Which discounted the review from 5 stars, for me)
Destined to be a Classic!",1514160000,,335,4.946428571428571

2254977,5,B000803BQM,"I love a good family film that focuses on both entertainment and education. This one fits both criteria exactly plus a lot more. What is this lot more you may ask? Well, I will give you a glimpse. First, I loved how relatable the premise was. Second, I thought the cast particularly Ice Cube did an amazing job in the role they were assigned. Third, I enjoyed the life lessons within this film and would rate it in my Top 10 films of all time. Wow! Big compliment, right? Last of all, I would say Hollywood should take notice that many moviegoers would rather see a meaningful film rather than a mindless action flick.",1498348800,,618,4.4298245614035086

Sometimes it's preferable to just RELAX with a great comedy, especially when it's a well-executed one like Are We There Yet? is.

It's about Ice Cub (not sure what his real name is... though it'd be sort of weird if his mother actually named him Ice Cube at birth!) finding a woman across the street from his store really attractive, but when he goes over to talk to her... he realizes she has kids.  KIDS!  Yes my friends, nobody likes a woman with kids (only kidding!)

Ice Cube feels utter disappointment until fate would have him meeting up with the woman on a rainy night to help jumpstart a car.  From there, a relationship is born however... guess what?  Her kids HATE Ice Cube!  In fact they dislike any man that tries picking up their mother, so... what do these children do about it, you wonder?  They torment the living heck out of Ice Cube using every trick in their arsenal!  Hey, that's what you feel like you HAVE to do when you're a kid, in order to protect your parents (at least, that's why I did it... though not quite THIS crazily, hehe).

Eventually Ice Cube has to take these kids across country to meet up with their mother, and oh boy, do *several* crazy things happen along the way.  Do they ever happen!  These kids lock Ice Cube out of the car and take over the steering wheel in a parking lot while Ice Cube is fighting to get inside (best segment of the movie) and another memorable segment occurs when the kids hop aboard a train and force Ice Cube to ride a HORSE in order to catch up to them.  Naughty kids!  I had to laugh when they escape Ice Cube and the daughter says ""Do you think we were too hard on him?""  LOL!

2255130,2,B000803BQM,"Synopsis:  Lifelong bachelor Nick Persons (played by Ice Cube) is a self-absorbed sports nut who likes the ladies but hates kids.  Well, he finds the attractive Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long) and wants to court her, but he has to deal with her two children Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden).  Well, Suzanne goes to Vancouver, misses the kids, and since their biological father cancelled his visitation appointment with them, Nick is destined to drive the kids from Portland, OR to Vancouver so he can show her what a swell guy he is.  Nick hates the kids, the kids hate Nick, so they kids do everything possible to sabotage Nick quest to court their mother.  During the process though, Nick realizes he's starting to develop feelings for the kids and the kids realize how hard Nick's trying to be a good guy.  Will it be enough to win Suzanne over?  (News Flash:  This isn't exactly a movie with a lot of twists and turns, so I think you can figure that one out...)

I took my sister to see this one and she enjoyed it immensely as a 10-year-old.  I sat through it thinking ""Geez... are they there yet?!""  The kids were good at what they did and I could see a case made that maybe it wasn't the actors and actresses' fault this movie suffered.  But the best way to put it is that you had a way-too predictable story reminiscent of any of the Home Alone movies that was full of stereotypes involving divorce (the dad who's too busy for his original family), young black men (of COURSE Nick Persons is going to drive in a souped-up SUV, right?), and improper representation of asthma attacks (Kevin suffers one in the movie and all it takes is puff from the inhaler to make him magically better.  If that's all it took, I coulda spent a lot less time in the hospital as a kid.)

If you wanna take the chance on this movie go ahead.  I think there's other films that I could recommend that would be a few steps higher than this film.",1240012800,5,1950,4.438202247191011

2255137,3,B000803BQM,"Nick Persons (Ice Cube) is a swinging bachelor that lives in Portland, Oregon.  He runs a successful and highly profitable sports hobby shop.  One day Nick sees a beautiful woman that he almost immediately falls for.  Her name is Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long) and she has all the characteristics of a mate that Nick has been looking for.  However, Nick soon learns that Suzanne is divorced and has two children.  Nick is terrified of children, but he likes Suzanne and is determined to make their relationship work.  The kids, daughter Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden), still desperately want their parents to get back together and have done everything in their power to prevent their mom from having a successful relationship with anyone else.  Even though Nick is nicer and more loveable than some of the other prospects, he is NOT an exception to the kids' dislike and they use their full measure of ingenuity to get rid of him.  But it doesn't work because Nick has fallen for Suzanne and vice versa.  Then Suzanne is forced to stay in Vancouver for New Years and asks Nick to bring her the kids so they can be together for the holiday.  The journey becomes a test for the relationship between Nick and Suzanne as well as the turning point between Nick and Lindsey and Kevin.

Other than being set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, ARE WE THERE YET? is a highly derivative film and doesn't really offer anything new to the family road trip subgenre.  There are scenes in the movie that are slightly altered, but have been used before in such films as NATIONAL LAMPOON'S FAMILY VACATION, HOME ALONE, and TOMMY BOY.  Also, it takes awhile for the audience to feel empathetic towards Lindsey and Kevin and the abuse they pour on Nick.  For half of the movie, the children seem completely selfish, uncaring, and downright cruel.

Still, even with a fairly weak and derivative script and a couple of self-centered kids, ARE WE THERE YET? works as a family movie.  The movie only has some comical violence, hardly any foul language, and contains an important message about the importance of family, sticking together, and the power of unconditional love.  It may not be a great movie, but ARE WE THERE YET? is a decent one that children and their parents can safely enjoy watching together.",1189296000,,2312,4.768844221105527

2255149,3,B000803BQM,"It is important in a movie to have the main characters be likeable or at least in the end you like them. These kids were so bad i wanted Ice Cube to revert back to a gangster and kill them. just go on ahead and take them out. Sounds harsh? well watch the movie, you'll see what i mean. if you had a kid that did their crap you would most assuredly think that these kids will end up being sociopathic murderers. They weren't bad in the cute movie sense. they were so evil and treacherous u wanted something severely bad to happen to them. Maybe just get maimed or something. Don't give me, ""they're just kids"" crap, they needed a series of gutt wrenching thrashings. They were so diabolically evil that if I were Ice Cube, i wouldn't want to go to jail by killing them so i would have to just leave them. i wouldnt run after them when they tried to run away like this fool did. Like his talking bobblehead doll said (by thw way, i think this proves taht Ice cubes character was nuts a bit) ""just say u wre mugged and go home"" If this wasn't a comedy you would think they were embodied with the spirit of Omen's Damien, and actually hope for their demise. i was disgusted to tears, LITERAL tears!!

it's not like Home Alone where the kid was defending himself agasint two bad guys who litereally wre trying to kill him. then its ok and cute to do those acts because it's justifiable, and you like the kid and are rooting for him. the fact that here is a man going out of his way to take some little brats hundreds of miles to another country and they are giving him such a horrible time makes me (a) not like them, (b) not like the mother for not instilling disiplne. all she says is, ""Be nice"". My husband kept saying its a movie and just laugh at it. he said, ""hey, after they scraped paint on his car i had one of two options: be mad throughout the movie or just let go and laugh. like watching the roadrunner"" yeah well, the coyote wanted to kill and eat the roadrunner so you were on the roadrunners side. my reply: they better have something bad happen to them so i can feel a little better. and yeah they did, **spoiler: they found out their daddy who they were doing all this bad behaviour for couldn't give a rats turd for them. End of Spoiler** i felt a little bad for them (but moreso, YEAH thats what you GET, you brats!!)and then the movie redeemed itself a bit with the relationships between Cude and kids. there was a scene where the kids said, ""we're horrible no one likes us not even our dad, no wonder he left"" of course, Cube consols them and says, "" i like you, you're great kids"". see? this is where the movie just lies all the way to the end to make us feel good or something.

The movie had a lot of corny things like Cube literally boxing a deer and what not, but its to be expected i guess in these types of movies. but what got me was that after all was said and done and thousands of dollars lost by damage, and possible needed therapy for Ice Cube, the mother just assumed he did something bad and treated him like dirt. Now, i'm ticked! She doesnt even listen to his explanation, just says it was a mistake trusting him. ARGH! then of course at the end, changed her mind because the kids who never liked anyone likes Ice Cube. How Fickle!! What?, just because your kids like someone you immedately want to date them? I wonder what their relationship is like after now that we are in the ""ever after"" portion at this point. the mother was very unlikeable an clueless. the ending makes you hate the mom and hope that she gets out of the picture and ice cube and the kids live happily.

SUMMERY because of the emotinal rollercoaster i give it 3 stars because i sorta liked it after it was finished, but it took a WHOLE lot out of me. i say this, if u want a cute famiy film...it's ok. maybe kids will like it, but if you're a parent watching it with your kids, i hope you tell your kids while watching it, ""please don't ever get like this"". as an adult i KNOW that the first 30 min will make u literally fighting mad. don't believe me? look at the other reviews. some people even said they turned it off after 30 min. only watch if u feel like being mad for 30-40 min.",1158796800,2,4192,4.185643564356436
2255150,2,B000803BQM,"""Are We There Yet?"" is a dopey, ill-conceived, one-note comedy that seems designed to turn prospective parents off childrearing forever.

Nia Long plays a beautiful divorcee whose two obnoxious brats naively believe that some day their estranged parents will reconcile and they will be a united family once again.  To this end, they devise elaborate schemes to sabotage her chances with any man unfortunate enough to show the slightest romantic interest in her.  Enter Nick Persons (Ice Cube), a child-hating bachelor, who falls for Suzanne but who balks at the prospect of taking on a ready-made family.  Nevertheless, he reluctantly agrees to transport the children from Portland where they live to Vancouver where their mother is attending a convention.  Predictably, the trip turns out  to be a literal hell on wheels for the inexperienced, hapless young man, with the children creating serious havoc both to his person and to his psyche every step of the way.

I suppose that small children may enjoy some of the antics contained herein, but no reasonable, thinking adult will derive even the teensiest kernel of enjoyment from this film.  Hampered by its formulaic, cookie cutter plotting, the movie provides little more than an endless stream of inane pratfalls, potty humor and gross out gags, sinking so low as to include a talking bobble head doll and a boxing deer in a desperate effort to obtain laughs.  The performances are poor across the board, but, in all fairness to the actors, one has to consider the material they've been handed to work with before judging them too harshly.  Ah well, at least the Northwest scenery is worth looking at.",1158105600,7,1657,5.014598540145985

It's refreshing to see a movie marketed to kids without the overkill profanity which is running through movies these days (I'm no fricking prude, though; I enjoy films with profanity, crudity, violence and sexuality). Watch for a scene-stealing Jay Mohr (executive producer of TV's ""Last Comic Standing"") as Ice Cube's kid-hating boss. Rated PG for comic violence.",1157328000,,643,5.133333333333334
2255152,3,B000803BQM,"I have to confess that I really enjoyed this movie. The Ice Cube of today is a long way removed from the gun toting, foul mouthed Ice Cube of the gang movie and hip hop culture of the early 1990s. Don't get me wrong: Boyz in the Hood is an important film, and his early rap albums are some of the best in the genre.

But in this movie, Ice Cube is downright loveable and cuddly, and he gives a refreshingly domesticated performance as Nick Persons. Nick tries to woo an attractive divorcee (Nia Long) into dating him by taking her kids on a long distance trip to Vancouver. I guess the idea is that if he can do her this favor and show that he is making an effort to bond with the children, she will receive him.

But everything that could possibly go wrong on this trip goes wrong. The kids turn out to be hellishly behaved kids, almost as bad as some of the characters that Ice Cube has played in the past, and undeniably more annoying.

The things the kids do to torture poor Nick can hardly be construed as humor in retrospect, but that is how the gags are presented. The movie turns around at the halfway point when Nick starts to love the children in spite of the fact that they are abusing him, and the kids start to love Nick in spite of the fact that he likes their mom.

Up until the movie's midway point, you can't help but wonder, ""Who in the world would want anything to do with these rotten kids?

2255153,2,B000803BQM,"""Are We There Yet?"" has a clever title, but that's the only good thing about the movie. It's an absolutely torturous road movie which has got to be one of the worst films made in recent years.  Basically, Nick, played by Ice Cube, gets a crush on a single mother, only they more or less develop a platonic relationship instead. She has two demon children who don't want her to date anybody. They are selfish and generally terrible monsters. They barely seem to have a shred of decency.  none of the characters in this film are at all likable, except maybe Nick. Poor old Nick offers to drive the children across the country in his new car as a huge favour for the mother. Huge mistake. Here begins a part of the film even worse than the beginning where everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong. Bad things happen to Nick, his car starts to become a wreck, and this is supposed to be funny?  The only thing amusing in this film was when Nick referred to Suzanne as a ""breeder"" and when that annoying Hamster Dance song came on.  As annoying as that song is, you can't help but smile.

Watch this movie and you'll probably want to take a vow of celibacy.",1154217600,7,1162,4.386046511627907
2255154,4,B000803BQM,"Are We There Yet? is a fun road movie replete with cute jokes and juvenile slapstick humor. It's somewhat reminiscent of Home Alone,  in terms of its over the top, tailored-for-kids sensibilities and its holiday setting. It offers two precocious kids Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden), both of whom still harbor a hope of reconciliation between their divorced parents. They don't want any new guy to come in between, and, thus, they gleefully put Ice Cube thru his paces. You know what you're in for when you see urine and vomit spewage incorporated into the picture. But in the end, like all movies of this ilk, it's all sweetness and light and good family tidings.

It's the Christmas season and Nick Persons (Ice Cube), owner of a cute store (or, as he insists on calling it: ""a fine sports collectible"" store), had just purchased his dream ride, a tricked-out Lincoln Navigator (with way cool dubs). Jay Mohr's character calls it ""6000 tons of respect."" Now equipped with all the bling-age he needs, he is ready to play. But, on that same day, he sees and is instantly smitten with Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long), a single mother of two. But Suzanne doesn't want a romantic entanglement because Nick hasn't even bothered to ask about her kids and probably doesn't even know their names (""Theo and Rudy?"" Nick ventures a guess). So Nick finds himself languishing in the ""friend zone"" and is ridiculed by his homies.

To make things worse, he gets stuck having to drive the bratty kids from Portland all the way to Vancouver to hook them up with their mom for New Year's. When his attempts to fly and then take the train go awry, he ends up driving the kids in his cherished Navigator, which starts out in pristine condition and ends up totally wrecked. In their travels, the three make pit stops to meet misguided good-samaritan truckers, a crazed deer and combative snowmen. But, no worries. Nick the Quick will somehow come thru for Suzanne with the kids intact, even if you can't say the same for his ride.

Ice Cube once again ventures into the wacky comedy genre and acquits himself very well. Over the years, Cube has been doing good film work and has snuck up on me as an actor. Nowadays, I think of him more in cinematic terms than from a music standpoint. Here he perfectly balances his wacky antics, good physical comedy work, and even some sensitive dramatic moments, while still remaining quinessentially Cube. This movie would've been better served with more screen time for Nia Long, who is cute but underused. The kids are pretty good, once they grew on me (I found them initially annoying and unlikable; Cube's character is a saint!). Jay Mohr's in there fleetingly and Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek's Uhura) cameos as the freaky Miss Mable.

All in all, everything works with the possible exception of Nick's advice-happy Satchel Page bobblehead doll, of which gimmick I feel is unnecessary. So if you're looking for a pretty decent family flick the kids will like, this is the one. The humor here is definitely more up the kids' alley, with the adults perhaps rolling their eyes at all the crazy shenanigans. Three and a half stars, and a big YAY-YAY for Cube!",1153785600,,3192,4.744144144144144

My wife and I enjoyed it and we laughed out loud at several scenes like the car sick boy and the crazed deer in the woods. The kids are so unbelievably bad you have to laugh. They go from the most obnoxious kids on Earth to decent ones once they see their dad has another life now. Ice Cube goes from a gigolo to a family man in a life changing turn of events. Overall we found it entertaining and would recommend to families. I personally have not seen a movie cut just like this as some critics indicate. I think it has replayability and so I bought a copy. This road trip movie is likely to entertain those that found the ""Home Alone"", ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"", or ""Jingle All the Way"" movies funny. Keep in mind this is a far-out comedy and you would never meet people like this on the street. I think some people get to wrapped up in how unrealistic the people are in the movie, especially the kids. If you took one or two things the kids do it would be believable. But they take all the worst things kids do and that is the point. They show the worst and best of people to make us laugh.

2255157,1,B000803BQM,"I am so tired of all of these cookie cutter movies and what I mean by that is that they all have the same story and same predictable ending.  The girl is attractive, the girl has kids, the kids don't want mom dating anyone else.  They fight every guy that comes to date mom, but this one guy (Ice Cube) won't go away and then there is some additional drama in between and happily ever after.  Blech!  This movie was just silly.  1/4 of the way through the film I was bored, 1/2 way through the film, I was ready to shut it off, but I figured since I spent 1 hour of my time, I may as well finish it.  This movie was just silly because there is no way on earth that any man would put up with those little whiny brats that long.

A good film endears you to the characters that way you can feel their pain and empathize, but these kids were terrible brats from the beginning and I just got more disgusted by their antics as the movie went on.  All the money the man spent on that car and the brat puked all over it and made him run off cliffs, and the deer scene was just ridiculous.

Then the girl did a very bleak performance of RESPECT.  Ugh!  The irony of it is that that child had no respect for anyone so she had no business singing a song called RESPECT.  That was so stupid to chose that song for her to sing.

I know it sounds like I am on a tirade, but I just can't stand this movie.  It is just one of the worse movies I have spent my time watching.  In my mind I was like ""Is It Over Yet?""  It was not enjoyable and the kids just made me mad cause the things they were doing were just so darn stupid.  I know that in real life, kids do act out but it generally isn't funny when they do it.

Since his rise to fame as an actor with Boys N The Hood in 1989, Cube has been in hit movies like Friday and The Barbershop and duds like Torque and XXX 2: The Next Level.

Are We There Yet is his latest lightfare road comedy about a man named Nick who wants to prove to the woman, played by Nia Long, he's interested in that he can handle responsibilities by taking her two snot-nosed kids from Oregon to Toronto where she is conducting business just in time to celebrate New Year's with her in his brand new Navigator. The kids do almost everything annoying and disgusting that you can think of: throwing up in the car, locking Nick out and taking the car for a wild spin, and setting Nick's pride and joy on fire!

The film is cute and tolerable considering that it borrows its ideas from past road comedies like Vacation, Planes Trains And Automobiles, and Road Trip. However, kids and even grown ups will laugh at how silly Ice Cube can really be!

2255161,2,B000803BQM,"There is nothing wrong with a contrived conflict to move the plot along, especially in a slapstick kid's comedy.  However, if a movie is not really that funny, then contrived conflict is just another annoyance.

In ""Are We There Yet,"" Ice Cube plays Nick, the owner of an upscale sports memorabilia store and a ""Playa.""  Nick is struck by lightning when he scopes Suzanne (Nia Long) across the street from his store, but is just as quickly turned off when he sees Suzanne's two children, Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden.)  By chance, Suzanne's car stalls on a deserted highway on a rainy night, and Nick gets the chance to get to know Suzanne as a person, not to mention to show off his new, tricked-out Lincoln Navigator.  Lindsey and Kevin are convinced that their parents will eventually reunite, so the two do everything in their clever and bratty little heads to keep potential suitors away from their mom.  However, when the children's father is unable to take them, Nick volunteers to fly with the kids to Vancouver where Suzanne has a business event.  However, after a series of unfortunate, unlikely, and manufactured events, Nick decides to drive the kids to Vancouver in the Navigator.  Let's just say things get ugly for Nick.

In general, such an adventure will eventually produce either a likeable protagonist, moral transformation of the antagonists, or both.  `Are We There Yet' fails to accomplish either.  Nick is inconsistent in his approach to the Lindsey and Kevin, and he varies in his desire to strangle or to hug the two ornery little brats.  (I can't say that I could have blamed him if Nick did actually strangle the kids.  At least Nick would have gone to prison and the movie would have ended there.)  Lindsey and Kevin themselves never really seem to get the point that treating other people, adults, like refuse is not the way to a happy ending.  Even the happy ending was forced.

`Are We There Yet' certainly had potential, however.  Small roles for Nichelle Nichols (who portrayed Lieutenant Uhuru in the original Star Trek television show and films) as Miss Marble, the kids' babysitter, Jay Mohr as Marty, Nick's employee at the memorabilia store, and Tracy Morgan as the voice of the Satchel Paige bobble-head doll provided the opportunity for a lot of fun for both children and parents in the audience.  However, very little of the characters' jokes or personalities were very well developed, and thus fell flat.  (Marty did have the line of the movie though.  When talking with Nick on his cell phone during his trip through Hell after Nick endures yet another particularly difficult onslaught from Lindsey and Kevin, Marty quips, ""If the kids hate ya,' Mommy won't date ya.'"")  Even Nia Long's character, Suzanne underwent a frightening transformation from a loving, potential love interest for Nick to some sort of shallow mega-bitch.

In short, there is not much here.  The silly, slapstick humor fell short.  The kid's behavior was not funny and a poor model for a young audience.  `Are We There Yet' was simply all over the place and never quite went anywhere.  I guess it's better than Vancouver.",1139788800,6,3157,4.865168539325842

This was a different type of role for Ice Cube.  Taking on the challenge of working with kids was a bold move.  Not sure if he'll do it again anytime soon.  There were plenty of laughs in the movie.  However, overall, the movie didn't do too well at the box office.

2255163,1,B000803BQM,"Just because `Are We There Yet?' reached the No. 1 of box office, and gained more than $80,000,000 in US doesn't mean that this awful film deserves such attention. Revolution Films must have thought this could be a great family-oriented film (with the director of two filmed `Flintstones' and `Jungle All the Way'). OK. But if you please, read the following synopsis, and imagine what kind of picture you and your kids will be watching.

First meet Ice Cube as Nick, owner of successful sports memorabilia shop. Nick is a avowed child-hater, and ladies' man too. But we are supposed to like him, and surprisingly Ice Cube does the job fairly well. And another romance starts between Nick and Suzanne (Nia Long), single mother, slightly workaholic, who has two children.

[THESE KIDS ARE SO...] Now meet the most obnoxious kids in the film's history, Lindsey and Kevin. Now I tell you, these spoiled kids are so determined to do whatever is possible to frustrate the fledging romance involving their mom. So little Lindsey sticks out her tongue, speaks back strongly when spoken to, and never loses chance to humiliate Cube's character verbally while her little brother Kevin is so intent on breaking things, grumbling about everything, and humiliating Ice Cube like his sister.

And they must travel 300 miles together for the reasons so contrived and unbelievable that I cannot write it here. All I can say it is not `Planes, Trains & Automobiles.' If I remember correctly, John Candy was never responsible for the total destruction of bran-new SUV, and Steve Martin never fought a deer with bare hands. Remember, Ice Cube fights one, not `hunt'.

The kids here are all unlikable, who are having fun playing mischievous pranks on an adult who thinks he had to endure all of them. Their mom is equally off-putting, behaving annoyingly, using her love's heart not to lose her job. But at the end of the journey, there is a predictable and obligatory feel-good moments in which the characters confirm the value of family, and the bond between each other. My advice: avoid it unless you like now clichd gross-out gags. Or if you want to teach your kids some effective ways to irritate adults, this is for you. As to the latter purpose, I can be certain of the effects of `Are We There Yet.'.",1137628800,4,2288,4.799492385786802
2255164,5,B000803BQM,"Ice Cube has been waiting for an opportunity to show his *softer* side.  I imagine when he got this script it was a no-brainer - THE PERFECT ROLE FOR HIM TO SHOW HIS BREADTH.

Ice Cube has really turned his life around and I LOVE watching him play such a hilarious part in such a hilarious movie.  Some people seem to think this movie has no audience.  But, those people would only know that if they've seen it.  And, if they've seen it, then *they* are an audience!  This movie DOES have an audience, that's inevitable.

I really love it when people keep using older, cliche' sayings like ""are we there yet?"" or ""i don't do mornings"" or ""must be MONDAY!"".  This movie is appropriately named, because it seems to be playing on a timeless type of humor similar to the sayings I listed above.

He's great whether he's in  a comedy or drama and let me just say that he gets finer with each passing movie.

He actually has a flare for being the underdog, the everyman who you root for even when he gets kicked around.

This movie, however, didn't make the most of his talents.  The story had potential for a madcap adventure.  The kids, unfortunately, were the biggest problem.  They were just plain annoying.

2255174,1,B000803BQM,"Okay...this movie stunk on ice.  The plot gets all twisted out of shape later on, and you're wondering, ""Wait, I thought they were somewhere else!""

The basic story: There's a guy working at his store.  He sees a lady through the window on her street.  He immediately falls in love with her.  The he realizes that she has two little kids.  And he H.A.T.E.S. little kids, so he gets all discouraged...heck, when he passes the lady on the road, he almost decides not to help her because she has kids!  But then he does, and she tells him of her life while riding his car to where she works.

She says, oh, you know, the usual: I am divorced, I can't support my children and I need you as part of the plot to take me to work every day.  So he (Ice Cube) agrees to the matter.  They start to fall in love with each other.

That's when she asks him of something else: she wants him to take her kids to her ex-husband so they can visit.

And about the kids: they try to stop guys from falling in love with their mom, so they, you know, pull all those ""Home-Alone"" booby-trap devices on them and the guys always end up running away in fear.

Anyway...the guy almost disagrees to driving her kids to their dad's house!  And the father lives real far away, so that way, we can have a lengthy movie about the trip (soooo original).  Afterwards, the mom is like, ""Pleeease...?""  Teary-eyed and whatnot, you know, the movie directors trying to add cheesy romance in this childish movie. So the guy agrees to taking them.

Of course, imagining the kids' behavior, like I stated earlier, they were ticked off as heck to being with a dude they never met.  So now, they're on the road.

he parks at an airport to begin the trip.  Here's where the amateur not-so-funny humor begins.  The guy is going through the metal-detecting doorway.  He takes his metallic stuff out.  The little boy of the two kids takes a look at a metal things that Ice Cube put on the counter, and the kid PUTS IT BACK into his pocket without the guy knowing.  So, unenlightened on this little prank, the guy walks through, the buzzer goes off, and everyone kicks him out of the airport.  Now he's left with the use of his car.  He drives to a train station.  The kids stow away WITHOUT HIM on the train, he's trying to keep up with them, slowing down, etc.  Afterwards, the trio is magically together again, walking towards the car, as if the whole previous scene never even happened.

That's just the beginning of the stupid humor involved in this movie; another lame part was when the kids, while in the back seat of Ice Cube's car, are next to a truck in the other lane.  The girl puts up a sign in the window saying ""WE'RE BEING KIDNAPPED!""  So the truck-driver rams into the car, sending Ice Cube and the whiny children plummeting towards a lake.

...But since this is a movie ""for the whole family to watch again and again,"" they magically survive.  Then they continue going to their dad's house.

  Then the truck driver returns later on in the movie to TAKE THE KIDS HE TRIED TO RESCUE (by ramming them off the road and nearly sending them all through a windshield, if that's heroism, then what's crime?!) EARLIER.  He steals them and takes them onto his truck, Ice Cube in close pursuit.  The chase prevails onto an ice rink, where everyone is slipping and sliding, you know, to get a laugh from the little kids watching this movie in theaters.  Typical Rug-Rats humor.  Then the boy gets an asthma attack, Ice Cube tries to help.

The mother of the children magically appears there (plot device, I'm sure), and she ends up not wanting to talk to Ice Cube anymore because of his incompetence.  Then the truck driver apologizes, as if that's the answer to all problems, even asthma, and the driver and Ice Cube go on like nothing ever happened.

""Yeah, I apologize for ramming you all off the road yesterday...what was I thinkin'?""

Then, at the end, of course, to have a happy ending, the mother agrees to marry Ice Cube after everything he did.

This movie is pure rubbish.  Ice Cube is a ""playa"" who's trying to pick up some lady with two kids, who happen to hate any man that tries to date their mother.  It just so happens that Cube hates kids but he has fallen in love with this lady so he's gonna make an attempt.  For some stupid reason or another, he's got to drive this lady's two bratty kids cross-coutry.  And wackiness ensues...His new SUV gets smashed up a hundred ways by these wacky kids, but along the way they get to know and like each other.  It makes you want to puke.  And don't even make me talk about the stupid talking bobblehead doll...god, I hate this movie.

Ugh...this entire movie is pretentious, predictable, and downright annoying.  Ice Cube is just not cutout for this cutesy kind of kid movie; he needs to stick to being a gangster and killing people.  You'll actually find yourself hoping thoughout the film that he'll pull out a MAC-10 and just gun the brats down.  The children are just so annoying that you will want to stab your eyes out.

2255182,2,B000803BQM,"This film is plainly marketed towards kids.  It is kids who ""star"" in the movie.  Ice Cube acts like a kid.  There are more kids than adults throughout the course of the movie.

Older kids (read: teenagers) might think this is a little too silly or obnoxious or both.  And adults... come on!!!  Anything meant to be taken seriously is so over-the top or unrealistic that it is hard to find any true pleasure in this film.

Despite the usually tame PG rating, I wanted to check out the movie before purchasing for my nearly 9-year-old son.

First of all, would a 9-year-old find this movie entertaining?  Certainly!  There is a lot of childish slapstick to keep any 9-year-old on the edge of their seats.  There are some adult issues that come up, but nothing a 9-year-old really couldn't understand.

But the bottom line is, I would feel uncomfortable having my 9-year-old watch this.  For two reasons:

Mainly, it is the dialogue.  It was atrocious.  I wanted to take those kids and wash their mouths out with soup.  They said things that little kids should not be saying, or even thinking.  These are supposed to be sophisticated kids?  I'd hate to see what they think unsophisticated kids talk like.

Also, it is the way the kids treat others.  They are just plain sadistic.  They nearly kill innocent men and sit back and laugh at it as if they had it coming to them.  Oh yes, pass the popcorn.

So, little kids shouldn't see it and everybody else won't like it.  That leaves.... nobody.  Nobody should see this film.",1121212800,14,1521,4.582089552238806
2255183,4,B000803BQM,"This movie is all about a black mother, her two children, and a black man who just bought a new car on New Year's Eve.  The mother is a divorcee who's preparing to go on a business trip while her children spend the New Year with their father, Frank.  He, of course, doesn't care about the children so he calls in sick, meaning that they're going to have to go on the business trip with her.  The black man, Nick (who hates kids), has his eyes set on dating her, so he become her friend then decides to take the children on to the business party so that she wouldn't have to stay behind and bring the children herself, thereby losing her job.  This is intended to impress her.  Quite frankly, it's a disasterous feat to try and pull off.

The children believe that their father is still planning to get back together with their mother, so they chase all their mom's dates away.  They're forced to go with Nick, so they decide to make it **** on wheels.  1st they miss the plain, then they miss the train, then they start driving and cause trouble by acting like Nick's being abusive and telling a truck driver that.  The truck driver, Big Al, decides to push Nick off the road.  This destroys the cars wheels.  And while Nick's trying to convince the shop keeper of a car repair shop to fix his car, the children hop on a train an ride to the town where their father lives.  They go right to his house.

Their father is remarried and has another child, whom they see him play with.  This dashes their hopes that their parents will ever get back together, and makes them feel as if the divorce was all their fault, becauase their father has another child, so they think that they weren't good enough.  Been there, done that, not doing it again.  After they get over this there's a whole other bunch of mishapps and then a happy ending.

I think that children (in the audience) like to see children (on the screen) be independent, take charge, and so on. But the writers and directors seem to think that the only way to do this is to take the situation WAY over the top. And by that I don't mean just ""unrealistic"" but viciously unrealistic.

Movies can have troubled children as part of the story but to show kids directly causing near manslaughter (or laughing at it when it just happens) is sending a terrible message.

Just to keep the bad writing intact, they make the adults as near-morons. If a truck driver seriously thinks children in the adjacent lane are in jeopardy, does he really think that he is ""helping"" by trying to force the car off the road?

Children that are 12 years old now are genetically the same as children of a generation or two ago. If they have become jaded and EXPECT this kind of behavior onscreen I blame fully the producers and the writers. And if life imitates art, which seems to be happening, parents might want to take a look at some of these PG movies.

The children in this movie are not completely original to this generation. Back in the 50's, Danny Thomas had a TV program ""Make Room for Daddy."" Rusty, his son, talked to his dad in a way that would never have been tolerated in most homes then. But it seems that his personality has been the one to win out in so many movies lately.

I'm not saying that the writers have to make clones of Oppie Taylor, the Boxcar Children, or Tom Swift, Jr. But they might want to look into those fictional lives and see how they resolved problems great and small without their causing somebody to fall in a manner that would put that person in a wheel chair for life.

2255187,3,B000803BQM,"There is quite a bit of perilous tightrope walking involved in mixing violent slapstick comedy and heartfelt pathos. Charlie Chaplin did it a lot and you can certainly point to the original ""Home Alone"" as being a successful mix. But in the former the target of the physical attacks was usually some guy twice the Little Tramp's size and in the latter it was the Wet Bandits. That is not the case with ""Are We There Yet?"" There are certainly some laughs to be had in this 2005 comedy, but for the most part I find myself cringing at what was happening on screen and the only reason director Brian Levant's film gets 3 stars is because there are a few success and rather important moments of pathos in this mess.

Nick Persons (Ice Cube) has an upper scale sports collectible store and a brand-new Lincoln Navigator, when he is smitten by the sight of Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long). The bad news is that she is a single mom with a pair of terror tots, Lindsy (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden), who have been taking care of all of mom's would-be boyfriends. They are waiting for their mom to reconcile with their dad. Nick wants nothing to do with children, but he and Suzanne become friends and when she has to go to Vancouver for work and her ex-husband bails on having the kids for New Year's, he ends up agreeing to transport the kids and the madness begins.

The core problem here is that these kids are viscous little monsters who physically assault innocent men. This is not cute little Kevin hurting the bad guys who are trying to rob his home, but two kids going after every guy who wants to date their mother. It is not funny it is mean. It is also dangerous, which gets us to another key problem with this movie in terms of how many times the attempted humor has to do with cars and trucks. In other words, situations that in the real world would get these kids killed are repeatedly done for laughs in this movie. Watching a couple of kids screaming while the car they are in is squeezed against the railing on the highway by a fully loaded semi-truck is not all that funny in the real world and we kept cringing through all of these types of scenes (there are several). Granted, it is not wise to confuse a movie with the real world, but there are moments when this film wants to talk to the reality that there are a large number of African-American children being raised without their fathers living in the house. More importantly, those are the best moments in the film.

This is because Nick is not a bad guy, which is the flip side to the core problem, and another reason to cringe every time they go after him. Nick thinks he does not like children and this particular pair of demons give him ample reason to reinforce that idea, but when these children need help, physical or psychological, he immediately goes to their help. The latter is the more important part, because you know full well that these children are going to get their comeuppance when they find out the truth about their father and the moments in which Nick talks to the kids, as opposed to screaming or sticking out his tongue at them, are the best moments in this film because they are the most real.

The fault for this film is to be found in the screenplay by Steven Gary Banks, Claudia Grazioso, J. David Stem and David N. Weiss (four writers is rarely a good sign), because the performances by Ice Cub and the two kids are fine given what was written (Long is reduced to a minor part in the story, which is why the resolution is problematic for me). Jay Mohr has a small part in this film as Marty, Nick's friend who keeps reminding him of how much he does not like kids, and Tracy Morgan does the voice of the Satchel Paige bobble-head doll that Nick has on the dashboard of his vehicle (who does Nick think will be watching DVDs in the backseat if he does not like children?). It was also great to see Nichelle Nichols in a bit part as Miss Mable. What would have been even better was a film that dealt more realistically with the basic idea, which is certainly an important one.",1118966400,3,4084,4.398148148148148
2255188,5,B000803BQM,"Ice Cube is just about a versatile an actor as they come.  He performs to perfection in this genuinely charming comedy.  He reminds me of Steve Martin in that he seems to have the IT factor that makes a person funny - kind of the opposite of Pauly Shore, if you know what I mean?

Are We There Yet? is a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.  Ice Cube, and the rest of the cast, of course, made this film a pleasure to watch.

Yes, it is predictable.  Yes, it is even a very simple plot that unfolds rather quickly, and unlike the classic Adventures in Baby-sitting, this movie found itself relying more on acting than an abundance of side-plots.

Nia Long was convincing in her role as the single parent, but I think the audience knew too little about her character throughout the film.  This error was in the script and not in Nia's inability to act.  There's no doubt Nia Long can play to the big screen.  She has been in a LOT of movies, and she always nails her role.

Aleisha Allen, who was in The School of Rock, is absolutely adorable as the destructive and vindictive Lindsey Kingston.  She did not overact the way some child actresses do.

Kudos to her onscreen brother, too.  Philip Bolden has a long career ahead of him.  Put this kid in a (an) M. Night Shyamalan movie and watch him steal the show!

All and all, this simple comedy really delivers the goods.  From watching Ice Cube teach Bolden's character how to scare off bullies with ""the face"" to seeing a Lincoln Navigator being slowly destroyed by the antics of two determined little ones, I enjoyed every minute of it.

I highly recommend this film.

The kids are out and out mean, and this makes me thing Nia Long's mother didn't have the parenting skills to deal with being a single mom either.  I found nothing ""cute"" about their behavior and don't really understand how Ice Cube put up with them as well as he did.

Touting this as a ""family"" movie is truly hypocritical, as it does nothing but give kids the go ahead to do mean and hateful things and then just laugh them off.  Ice even manages to lose his very expensive Navigator and still wants to be a papa to the brats.  I can't totally trash the movie, but I would not recommend it for any young children as it is certainly not the kind of movie I would want my little ones to see.",1117843200,2,975,4.271739130434782

2255193,1,B000803BQM,"I don't usually review movies, but the odious nature of this dvd has so moved me that I felt it necessary to throw an advisory out to the general public to avoid this movie, and perhaps inspire people to question how in the world movies like this ever get made.

My primary issue with this movie is the awful behavior of the kids in the movie. Brats of unparalleled measure, these kids are sadly typical of the kind of child we often see in movies, tv shows, and even commercials. The all-knowing brash child devils and their hapless parents is a formula that has become standard fare in Hollywood. Since when did children become so smart and parents such fools? As a public school teacher, I can tell you that the attitudes expressed by the children in this movie have spread to children and parents of an entire generation. It isn't a case of the chicken or the egg, I place the blame squarely on Hollywood and its stunningly powerful influence of people. My wife and I both painfully sat through the 95 minutes of hell this movie delivers and actually found ourselves satisfied when the children learn their dad is a big liar. The moment of truth in the movie wherein the viewer is supposed to understand why these hellions are the way they are had the reverse affect for us. We were happy that these horrible characters had finally reaped what they've sown.

Reviewers claim that their kids liked it, and perhaps that's the problem.  Children in control, parents floundering and having to endure outright cruel and demented behavior, and a feel-good ending...what kid wouldn't like this? Yet, in an era of overly protective attitudes regarding children, we allow this trash into our living rooms and laugh it up with our kids. There isn't a moment of respect, apology, or even the slightest remorse from these brats, and yet, it all works out well in the end. Life lessons? Given the state of children's behavior today and the utter ignorance and excessive tolerance levels of their parents, (been to a restaurant, shopping center, or playground lately?) I guess I shouldn't be surprised.",1117497600,15,2092,4.741758241758242

Because my choices were limited, I was stuck with choosing between this one or National Treasure. Thankfully, I chose ""Are We There Yet?"". I'm really glad I did because this movie is downright hilarious. The story goes a lil something like this....Nick, a playboy bachelor, and Suzanne, a divorced mother of two, is threatened by a particularly harrowing New Year's Eve. When Suzanne's work keeps her in New York City for the holiday, Nick offers to bring her kids to the city from Washington D.C. The kids, who have never liked any of the men their mom has dated in the past, are determined to turn the trip a nightmare for Nick. And, boy, is it ever a nightmare. Ice Cube turns in one of his most comedic performances in his career in this movie. I didn't think I'd like this movie too much beforehand but, after watching it, I think it was money well spent. I'm really glad it was the first movie that I got for my PSP. Which, I'd like to add as a sidenote, the PSP's capabilties of showing movies on the system is well past what I expected of it. It's high quality UMD video. I commend Sony for doing such an outstanding job with the PSP(It's, definitely, the Walkman of the 21st century).

If I could, I would shout ""It Stinks!"" a'la Jay Sherman, out loud in the theatre. Don't watch this. Instead try one of many of Pixar's finest.",1117065600,7,621,4.056910569105691
2255202,4,B000803BQM,"Yes, this film has the typical formula when it comes to family films...disaster (divorced dad does not hold up to his end of the bargin) Feel sorry for factor (MOM needs someone to watch the kids while she works, and kids really want to see daddy) The other man (Ice Cube) The ""villian"" (truck driver who thinks he is doing the right thing...but really isn't. Spoiled rotten kids (if you think of it, they did it...and did it well) but hey, this is a cute, funny film...it is not HILARIOUS no, and yes, some of the jokes get carried away, but this is not a movie to be picked apart by any means...this is a movie that is suppose to be enjoyed!! A great rainy day movie that you can actually sit down with the family and have a great time with!!

2255205,4,B000803BQM,"I didn't know what to expect of this movie, but it's a cross between Home Alone and Road Trip, with some emotional edge to it.  Well written and actually funny, even in the slapstick scenes, you can take your children to this if you don't mind them hearing the word ""damn"" about five or six times.  There is no sex, cursing other than listed above, and the only real violence comes from a deer who decides to take issue with Ice Cube--one of my favorite scenes of the movie.  Our whole family enjoyed this story, and I appreciate a new choice and new voices for family viewing.",1114819200,,577,4.373831775700935
2255206,4,B000803BQM,"Just wanted to let other parents out there know that someone likes this movie.  I understand others' compaints: especially, Ice Cube saying d*** a few times.  But if you can overlook that and you don't insist on a realistic portrayal of how kids act then you might enjoy this.  I laughed quite a bit, and I see a lot of family movies that put me to sleep.  This movie is rather like Planes, Trains and Automobiles for kids.  It also has a Home Alone/kids-versus-the-world feel to it.  I don't think kids will take this literally.  It's just fun.  And in the end Ice Cube learns the importance of family and wins the kids' respect so that they are able to let their guard down and feel safe for once.",1111622400,5,699,4.364341085271318
2255207,1,B000803BQM,"a mind numbingly boring and stupid supposed ""familycomedy"" about Ice Cube (Boys N The Hood, Barbershop) who is a playa who has his own sports collectibles shop and he gots the fresh new navigator with the spinners on it and he falls in love with Nia Long (Boiler Room) who has kids but he doesnt like kids and then to be a nice guy he takes the kids on a trip to see their daddy but along the way the kids have a way to sabotage the journey. who wrote this and why is Ice Cube, Nia Long and Jay Mohr (upcoming King's Ransom, Suicide Kings) in it. were they all forced to their will...was Cube forced to exproduce this, have his company in the credits and star in it and make himself look dumb? I think this is bottom of the barrel.....if you call this family entertainment having the kids sprout words about intimacy while parents have their kids in the audience while Cube says damn, damn, damn a lot...well...then I guess its considered a funny movie...I don't know. the situations are stupid, the acting extruciating and why did they have special effects.....WHY?!!! the little bobble head Satchel Paige voiced by Tracy Morgan (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Tv's SNL)shouldnt of been in it....what is the point to that...I can go on but, there's just too much idiotic and tasteless jokes in here to last you a lifetime. what a waste of my precious little time.",1111276800,6,1365,4.508064516129032

To top it off, a large part of the movie seems like a paid advert for the Lincoln Navigator. So the joke's on us.",1110067200,7,379,4.6716417910447765
2255209,5,B000803BQM,I thought this movie was very funny. it takes alot to make me laugh. I laughed out load at quite a few momments in the movie.  What more could u expect from a kids movie.  The people that hated this movie are the same people that liked garfield.  Now that was stupid!  Anyway Ice cubes Rap persona & him as a person are two totally different people.  The person reffering to Ice Cube being a racist obviously has some personal issues within hiself or herself.  Most of the producers for his films hav been white. Now if he was a racist why would he put money like that into a white persons pocket.  Anyway way of the subject.  Good movie.  Check it out!,1107993600,5,653,4.2439024390243905

2255211,3,B000803BQM,"I thought the movie was cute but follows the usual Hollywood machination of kids movies these days.  Sorely predicaable with a few laughs in between but nothing we haven't already seen before.

And in response to Mr. Donegal McGonagle's January 31 post, Yes I know all about Ice Cube with NWA and after NWA up until his War and Peace LP.  I personally don't need a lecture on Ice Cube when I've bought all his lp's and heard mostly all his interviews on a matter of subjects.  You're trying to compare a 21 year old Ice Cube of yesteryear to an almost mid thirties Ice Cube, who's been married for 14 years with three children of his own.  Now we all at one time have had views, done things, said things in anger and just without facts or merits.  That's what a lot of 20 and 21 year olds do.  Not defending everything he's done or said but you compare a man at 21 to when he's thirty something with wife and kids and you'll generally find that they are basically two different people.  I'm sure you're not the same being now that you were at 21 unless you are still in your early twenties and haven't matured or learned anything in life.  Before you start judging someone you don't know, clean up your pile of mess you have in your backyard cuz I know for a fact you are nowhere near perfect, sir.  And as far as spewing racism on this board, you need to be spewing it at Hollywood.  Hollywood has been blatantly racist towards african american performers and other minorities for decades up until the past couple of years.  Let's see your documentary of that.
