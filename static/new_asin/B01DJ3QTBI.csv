7712488,5,B01DJ3QTBI,"This was funny - more funny than I expected. It's a super hero story in the vein of 1960's Batman, but with more intentional laughs. A few of the gags are a bit forced, but i'm not complaining.",1465257600,,193,4.105263157894737

7712497,5,B01DJ3QTBI,"Charming story about friendship with a good amount of tongue in cheek humor and fantasy for entertainment.

7712503,1,B01DJ3QTBI,"Just stopped watching ""Electra Woman & Dyna Girl"" released by Sony Pictures.
I greatly enjoyed watching the original Saturday morning television series when it first premiered back in the 1970s.  Sure ""Electra Woman & Dyna Girl"" was a campy spoof of the even campier live action ""Batman"" series; but there was such a great sense of fun and comradeship between Laurie and Julie as they dared to face villains anywhere.
I was about 35 minutes into this mishmash of a reboot before I decided to call it quits - which is sad, because I really, really was looking forward to this reboot.
Electra Woman and Dyna Girl are re-imagined as small town crime fighters on a tight budge who year of making it big time, and apparently they do when a video they posted of two crooks they took down - literally ripping off the arm of an armed gun man with a device Dyna Girl invented - goes viral over the Internet and Electra Woman gets the call from Creative Masked Management in Hollywood.
A side note:  It seems that Electra Woman and Dyna Girl are second generation non-powered superheroes to emerge after the Great Shadow War that eliminated all super villains.
There is a problem with trying to be oh, so clever with doing a reboot to update characters, and Sony Pictures should have taken good notes with another updated reboot of a popular and beloved Sidd & Marty Krofft's Show that bombed spectacularly when it was made into a movie - Land of the Lost starring Wil Ferrel.
There's just no sense of fun in this reboot which strays from the original series.  It has some clever touches, but clever touches go out the window when the story has no heart and soul to it.
Not Recommended.

7712509,4,B01DJ3QTBI,"My only issue with this movie is that it isn't long enough. The pacing of the film was great and the actors all do a fine job.

7712510,3,B01DJ3QTBI,"With its bad language it's not intended for kids to see (not like the original at all). I would ,however, consider this a one time rental for adults that don't mind a PG-13 film which might have actually been considered R rated 10 years ago. I think the rating system is going down hill because I still enjoyed PG-13 films back then. The action was pretty lame too and had more drama than I cared for. The comedy wasn't great either.",1475452800,2,433,4.3580246913580245
7712511,5,B01DJ3QTBI,"The worst thing about this movie is that it was too short!

I loved it.

No useless romantic storylines. Witty banter. Excellent dialogue. And solid performances from the leads. I loved that the characters were legit superheros. I was expecting the plot to be based around ""learning how to fight / believing in yourself"".  Instead I got a story about sticking to your principles and succeeding on your own terms even when outmatched.  I loved the confidence without arrogance.

Honestly, the worst thing about this is that it was too short. Just too much world-building in a short time. I would love to see this become a regular tv show.",1474848000,,637,4.754545454545455

The plot is thin, the special effects are low budget, and occasionally the dialogue is terrible - but that's EXACTLY how the TV show was! If it wasn't for the adult language, this would be a fantastic after-school special.",1472256000,,418,4.819444444444445
7712524,1,B01DJ3QTBI,"Ugh.  Two main problems with this.  One, it feels like a handful of 3-5 minute skits that they decided to expand into a full movie...and then realized it was a horrible mistake after they'd committed to it.  The actors deliver a lot of padded, cliche-ridden scenes with a sort of teeth-gritting committment to their craft, but the enthusiasm doesn't seem to be there.  Two, it's not a superhero story, it's an ""indie rockers make it big"" story that is clearly embarassed by its own superheroics.  The FX are cartoonishly gory (unpowered human hero ""accidentally"" pulls a guy's arm clean off, superhero gets killed by a bar shot through his torso that leaves a faintly dripping hole, etc) and looks like something the Sharknado people would be unwilling to sign their names to.  There's a few okay bits, probably the original skit ideas, but I actually skipped over much of the middle because the cliche density was getting toxic.  Avoid this turdburger.",1472169600,6,953,4.881987577639752
7712525,4,B01DJ3QTBI,"Some demographic probably would rightfully give this five stars.  I'm too old.  And sometimes in this film they're skating on vibe alone, and even though the film is satire and parody to the max, I can't cut them a break enough to buy into the POVs.  That said, what's not to love about this confection?  Beautiful babes, cool CGI, and breathless rat-a-tat-tat zinger fusillades between these neo-Cher-from-Clueless upstarts in an alternate dimension where superheroes are common and the culture embraces this conceit -- which means good writing.  Which it was.

Everyone kept a straight face -- so the acting was superb.  Okay, there were parts, as mentioned, when I didn't resonate, and I almost started to tap a finger on my mousepad -- threatening my own editorial powers to leap ahead.  But I didn't.  But that's bother enough and why there's four stars.  Not that this is a major effort by a major entity or that four stars for this would mean this film was as worthy of a film with major budget and A listers with four stars.....two different levels of critical review.

But I'm easy. I saw the film for what it was in the trailer, and the trailer tells the truth.  And for an extra four bucks I bought the film instead of rent -- because of that trailer.  I missed a lot of the snappy dialogue, so a 2nd viewing is already a gimme.

And no, not all the jokes worked -- not in the least for me with my viewing history and age, but if I pretend I'm the director of this piece, I can explain everything nicely, and to heck with some elder's responses not being all non-RBGH milk and raw, unheated,organic honey.....ish.

Don't expect these youngsters to be today's millennials -- different dimension, remember?  They're doing their shtick in every scene in order to keep the zeitgeist validated....and pulling it off.

Again, if the trailer didn't grab ya -- skip the film.  If it does, you've got yourself a winner.",1471737600,4,1921,4.649851632047477

7712527,4,B01DJ3QTBI,"I enjoyed this movie mostly.  It is a take on the croft show of the 1970s.  Storyline is good, acting is good.  It is just generally good all around.

It follows Electra Woman and Dyna Girls humble superheroing (Yes, I just made it up!  You can use it) to the big leagues.  There is a price to pay for the big leagues and how the two superheroes deal with it.

Solid movie, just not perfect.",1471305600,,391,4.133333333333334
7712528,4,B01DJ3QTBI,"A cheaply made and funny comedy based on the superhero world.

I thought it was a fun and a great re-imagining of the characters. I especially enjoyed the snarky Dyna Girl (Hannah Hart). There was a story to be told, but it didn't overwhelm the film, and personally I enjoyed it as a campy superhero movie (what I wanted to see), and I enjoyed it even more because it did not to trample on my childhood memories, unlike many recent comic book movies.",1469577600,,650,4.516949152542373

The movie is action packed, full of tons of comedic relief, and as is the theme to both of these ladies shows: a lesson about staying true to yourself and your crew. The cinematography was super great as well, lots of traditional movie shots/pans/angles (very different from the youtube video style) and the acting of all parties was just great. I really hope a sequel comes out, because I could not get enough of this movie!

Think of a cross between ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (the live action movie; an underrated gem) and ""The Tick"" (an amazing live action TV show that was never given a chance).  The story is simple, the effects are pretty good, and the characters are quite likeable.  There are many (MANY) 4th wall breaks and inside jokes.  It's oddly violent from time to time, and they made a good choice not to tart it up too much.

They are picked up by Hollywood for a superhero contract and encounter  new challenges as life tries to separate our twosome. The film had me hooked in the first five minutes with fresh quirky humor. For those who like off beat humor, this one has it as it satirizes society and the super hero craze.

The one liners are worth the view.
