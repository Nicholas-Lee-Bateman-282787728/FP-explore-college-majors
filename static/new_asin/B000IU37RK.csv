Movie follows a girl whose young adulthood comes on a little too fast, and can't quite keep up with it. Director Andras Solyom shows a short period of her life from it's most exciting time to it's most tragic, at a snappy pace. Although it is narrated by the lead character, Solyom uses a  different actress, with a much older voice that really conveys the damage. Dorka Gryllus in the lead roll is perfect, she is so energized and flirty, and lonely and angry, she covers it all. Music, which I think must be some kind of Hungarian folk or folk/pop or something, is fantastic. Beautiful photography.",1183161600,5,750,4.474452554744525
8188105,5,B000IU37RK,I rented this video by sheer chance at a local video store. I was very pleased by what I saw. This movie had me thinking of men that had done me wrong in the past and the way I handled it. The woman who portrayed the obsessed character was excellent. I love the outcome of the movie most of all. Love does hurt when you allow it to hurt. And boy did she ever.,1018483200,2,359,3.864864864864865
