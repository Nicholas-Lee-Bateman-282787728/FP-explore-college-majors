8216943,1,B000V76W0E,"I didn't think I would ever come across a concert video worse than Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill: Live.""  It's taken more than a decade, but I've found it.  Shot in 16:9, but mastered with the old school 4:3 pillar boxes, this DVD is unwatchable.

The video image is vhs quality at best, not to mention the audio, which sounds like it was recorded by a bootlegger in the audience.

This piece of garbage should be avoided at all cost.",1281571200,3,444,4.5125
