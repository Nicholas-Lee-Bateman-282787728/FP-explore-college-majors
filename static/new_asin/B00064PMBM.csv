8038579,5,B00064PMBM,"This VHS videotape contains four of William Hanna's and Joseph Barbera's ""Personal Favorites"" from their highly-rewatchable animated one-season wonder from 1964-1965, ""Jonny Quest"". Mr. Hanna and Mr. Barbera even personally introduce each of the episodes presented here with a brief on-camera blurb before each of the programs on the video.

But before investing in a copy of this VHS tape, I'd strongly urge with the utmost amount of encouraging recommendation that you re-consider such a purchase and acquire, instead, the excellent ""Jonny Quest: The Complete First Season"" 4-Disc DVD boxed set that was originally issued by Warner Home Video on May 11, 2004.

That DVD set has all 26 episodes of the only ""true"" (and really good) season of the ""Jonny Quest"" TV cartoon series -- and that season would be, of course, the ""Classic JQ"" campaign from 1964-'65.

But, if you can't find the greenbacks to purchase that ideally-done complete-season DVD boxed set, then I'd recommend (as a consolation prize) this VHS cassette with four good Quest programs on it. :-)

This tape houses the following four JQ episodes (with original ABC-TV airdates and my own personal ""Star""/quality rating listed beside each entry):

1.) ""Skull And Double Crossbones"" (Episode #11; November 27, 1964)(3.5 out of 5 Stars)

2.) ""Calcutta Adventure"" (Episode #7; October 30, 1964)(4 Stars)

3.) ""The Robot Spy"" (Episode #8; November 6, 1964)(5 Stars)

4.) ""The Devil's Tower"" (Episode #21; February 4, 1965)(5 Stars)

-----------------

All-in-all, this tape has a very good representative sampling of the ""Classic"" (original) Jonny Quest TV series, with ""The Robot Spy"" topping the list as my personal favorite from this particular batch of programs. ""Spy"" is an excellent episode (as are virtually all of the 26 eps.), with the Quest Team working feverishly to thwart another diabolical scheme concocted by the evil ""Dr. Zin"".

I enjoy the way the spider-like ""Robot Spy"" contraption extends and retracts its legs from its bowling ball-like ""body"". Very clever writing I think, which is par for the course for this innovative and ahead-of-its-time animated series, which was always filled with cool-looking gadgets, exotic settings, ingenious creatures, and nifty vehicles. The ""Spy"" episode was written by William D. Hamilton, who is credited with writing multiple installments of the 1964 Quest series.

So, for some good cartoon action and adventure (plus all that gadgetry to boot), pop in this tape to immerse yourself once again in the intriguing and stimulating world of Jonny Quest. (But also continue to save your coinage for a future purchase of the Warner Brothers' full-season DVD Quest boxed set. The quality of that collection is virtually perfect and worth every penny you'll shell out for it, in my opinion. Some really cool DVD bonus features on it as well.)",1112745600,11,2853,5.232456140350878
