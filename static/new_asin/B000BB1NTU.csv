2409775,5,B000BB1NTU,"""The Ninth Day"" is not exactly a Holocaust drama in the strict sense as it's main focus is not about the persecution and extermination of Jews by the Nazis during WW II, but about the persecution of anti-Nazi clergy by the Nazis. It is a subject that is often overlooked in movies about WW II, but it was very real and these men of cloth truly suffered for their convictions. Based on the true life story of Father Jean Bernard, the movie centers around the trials and tribulations of Father Henri Kremer, who had been deported to the infamous Dachau concentration camp for his anti-Nazi activities [he had been assisting the Luxembourg resistance].

The beginning of the movie portrays Father Kremer and his fellow clergy being at the mercy of the sadistic camp guards, even witnessing the crucifixion of a fellow priest. Then something inconceivable happens - Father Kremer is informed that he has been released and is sent off back home to Luxembourg. It is only upon arrival in Luxembourg that Henri [Ulrich Matthes]realizes that something is afoot - he is whisked off by the Gestapo to meet with an SS official, Gebhardt [August Diehl] and unceremoniously informed that he has not been granted release, but a 'leave' of nine days, in which period he is to accomplish something for the Nazis' benefit.

To his utter disgust, Henri discovers that he has nine days to persuade his Bishop to sign a proclamation that confirms the Luxembourg church's allegiance to and alliance with Hitler and Nazi Germany. Henri has been chosen because of his family connections and close rapport with the Bishop, but we discover later that other factors also played a part in Henri being chosen for this role.

To collude with the Nazis is unpalatable to the devout and anti-Nazi Henri, but he also realizes the high risks involved in desisting - if he flees, his fellow clergy back in Dachau will be executed, and if he refuses, his family [a sister, a brother and a brother-in-law] will be at risk too. What is a honorable man of the cloth to do in such a position?

The movie is very much a human drama with lots of intense dialogue and verbal sparring ,especially between Henri and the SS Gephardt, but the pace never lets up. The audience is always kept on the edge of their seats as we wonder how each encounter with the cunning and evil Gephardt will turn out. There is not much violence in this movie compared to other WW II and Holocaust dramas - but there is a sense of pervasive evil throughout the movie as embodied by Gephardt and the sense of doom hanging over poor Henri.

The two main actors, i.e. Ulrich Matthes as Henri and August Diehl as the Nazi Gephardt are incredible in their roles - they truly come to personify the good and the evil. Ulrich Matthes' deep-set black eyes burn with a fervor that commands the screen - his anger & his anguish are effectively conveyed by his eyes without need of any dialogue. August Diehl as the wily Nazi is also a commanding presence on screen - his character seems cultured and deferential but the monster within is quick to emerge when thwarted in his goals. The theological debates between Henri and Gephardt are perhaps the best scenes in the movie - we have on the one hand, the devout Henri who is unmoved by any pleas or bribes to change his convictions, and the evil Nazi who tries to use religion to have his way [he's a former deacon who chose to become an SS over the priesthood]. I can't really describe it - but watching these two debate each other was truly compelling, especially in listening to Father Kremer rebut each point made by Gephardt.

All in all, this is a must-see for those who want to learn more about the persecution of anti-Nazi clergy during WW II. There aren't that many movies made on this subject, and this is one of the few stand-outs in terms of it's superior quality.",1233878400,7,3850,4.604956268221574
2409776,5,B000BB1NTU,"There are very few movies based on a book that faithfully relate the story and remain engaging. Either the film plods along as a page by page recounting of the book or it takes the story in an entirely different direction. This film, based upon Priestblock 25487 (a phenomenal read!) manages to strike this careful balance. While viewing the events of the book through the narrow prism of nine days in the life of a priest imprisoned in Dachau it fleshes out the plot, and includes some of the most jarring and graphic scenes of the book.

The film is also about faithfulness on another level, whether in the midst of the hell was the experience of those in concentration camps, one can maintain a firm grasp on one's faith.

The acting was superb, as was the cinematography. As many have already mentioned, this film is a true gem and deserves more recognition (as does the book upon which it is based.).",1221436800,12,905,4.580246913580247
2409777,5,B000BB1NTU,"The Ninth Day is one of Schlondorff's strongest works. The story concerns Ulrich Matthes, playing a Catholic priest, imprisoned in Dachau for working with the resistance and writing a persuasive tract opposing the Nazi racial laws.

A lapsed Catholic and Gestapo agent offers Matthes his freedom if he will  persuade his Bishop to embrace the Nazi cause. Weighed in the balance is not only his own life but the lives of thousands of Catholics.

Matthes struggles with an ethical, moral, and religious dilemma.

I like Schlondorff's films a lot but I don't think any film before this one maintains its point of view and tone as consistently as Ninth Day.

Although its subject matter is difficult to watch, the film is beautifully shot and every performance, even the small roles in Dachau are perfect.

The cruelty of the Nazi guards is horrifying.  They starved, beat, and worked the priests to death.  In one scene the guards build a cross and then, after crowning a priest with thorns, they crucify him.

The actor who plays Father Kremer is pitch perfect.  His face seems ravaged by pain and starvation.  Then, incredibly, he is given a nine day leave of absence from the camp.  And he will have to chose between his faith and freedom.

The water in the pipe story reminded me of something I read by Primo Levi. Ulrich Matthes's portrayal of Henri Kremer has to be seen.

2409780,5,B000BB1NTU,"The film begins in the Dachau concentration camp, one of the most brutal. We stay there long enough to meet Father Henri Kremer and his fellow clergy prisoners and to experience the day to day brutality and persecution they endure. One day, Henri is asked to follow the guard. Fearing the worst, a fellow pastor was just hung from a cross, he heads toward the area where the crosses are set up. Instead, he is redirected to the Commandant's office where, to his utter amazement, he is given his release. He boards the train to his home in Luxembourg. Trudging his way home in the snow from the station, he is picked up by the head of the Gestapo, Herr Gebhardt and told to report to his office promptly in the morning where he will discover, it's not a release he was given but a nine day pass. So begins Day one of nine in which he is to persuade the Bishop of Luxembourg to cooperate with the Nazis or he and his fellow clergy will be transferred to a death camp in the east. Will Father Kremer compromise his faith to save his and the others' lives? Every day he must report his progress to Gebhardt, personally, who uses every psychological trick he knows to persuade Henri to cooperate. Gebhardt is really Evil incarnate. It is a showdown between religion that would use power to dominate and control versus faith that seeks to serve and to love. It is the ultimate showdown of good and evil-the one with the weapons and the power and the one with love and faith. This is a powerful story that never lets up. It is intense to the end.

A stark and sometimes brutal piece, I cannot imagine that a person could be unchanged after seeing it.

From the autobiographical novel of a priest, Volker built a superb portrait, a struggling film, a striking drama where the pain, the suffering and the desperation will become the departure point and the delicate decision.

Kremer will just dispose of nine days to make his choice. Devastating and hard to forget drama, with absorbing and arresting images. You will notice the other side of the horror in Dachau.

Who are we (USA) over 2000 miles away to really understand a Vatican and Europe surrounded and intimidated by Nazi soldiers every day?

Specifically, this is a movie about the real imprisonment of scores of Catholic priests in the infamous Dachau Concentration Camp. It centers on political intrigue. But, more so though, it is about faith and courage in the face of certain death.

A very powerful movie. I am amazed that it was actually made by Germans, indicating a sincere sorrow for their country's past sins and a willingness now to confront these head on.

2409804,5,B000BB1NTU,"Director Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff has accomplished with ""The Ninth Day"" what so many filmmakers--American and foreign--fail to do: to depict a believable, human, and realistic clash between the psychic motivations that engender good and evil.

Based (loosely) on Father Jean Bernard's memoir ""Priestblock 25487: A Memoir of Dachuau"". Father Bernard was arrested in 1941 for speaking out against the Nuremburg racial ""laws"" and sabotaging Nazi relations in his native Luxembourg.  Though it is difficult to capture the power of the book, Schlondorff has done that and much more: he gives a baby face to the evil surrounding the priest in his memoir, a German actor who is perfect.  August Diehl is Untersturmf&uuml;hrer Gebhardt, a Gestapo agent who
looks like he could barely be past nineteen and and who was once a seminarian.

He tries to persuade Father Kremer (Bernard's pseudonym in the film) to get a letter from his Archbishop supporting the union of the Church in Luxembourg and the Third Reich: a Nazi Vatican dialogue in the only German parish left that refuses to welcome them.  He has nine days to accomplish this.  If he doesn't, he will be sent back.

The conversations between Kremer and Gerbhardt are what make the movie.  Gerbhardt is a young and super twisted Nazi who considers himself to be carrying out Christ's--or Judas'--mission on earth with his role in the Party.  His demonic theology is as follows: without Judas, without the backstabber of humanity, where would Christ be?  Therefore, extreme evil has just as much of a place in the world as goodness.  More, in fact.  The theological ""debates"" are life and death for Father Kremer and he prevails in the end by touching the only bit of conscience left in Gerbhardt's evil, ruined soul.

Many have mistakenly viewed Pope Pius XII as being silent during the Nazi's reign of terror. This film should clear some of that up and show why (and he wasn't, actually) his silence lasted for so long during certain periods of time.  He gave Jews Baptismal Certificates so that if the Gestapo showed up looking for them they could directly refer to his authority.  He saved lives.  He gave Christmas radio broadcasts denouncing the Nazi treatment of the Jews.  Kremer, in desperation, asks his Archbishop what the Holy Father is doing, why he must suffer so, and the Archbishop gives and good and factual explanation.

This film is pretty brutal and always realistic.  The triumph of Father Jean Bernard over maddening odds must be seen to be believed.",1245542400,7,2519,4.968973747016706

8084130,2,B000BB1NTU,"I have given this film two stars, despite the fact that the acting is superb and the film itself is beautifully done. There are minor glitches, such as a mass of red carnations on a grave in the middle of the war, and people drinking tea, but these do not take away from the strength of the individual performances and the accuracy of the portrayal in other respects.
My problem with the film is the fictional story itself. The film is based upon the true memoirs of a priest interned  in Dachau, who was given leave. He was confronted with a choice of conscience and returned to Dachau. That, in itself, is a pretty amazing story. Perhaps the realities of Dachau, being, as I have read in 'Christ in Dachau' basically, the priests being worked until they died, were thought by the director/scriptwriter of this film to not amount to a dramatic film. In any event, the true account was deemed Insufficient, and was changed to a fictional adaptation. It is this adaptation with which I have a problem;
First, the conflict and drama of the dialogue arises from the juxtaposition of a young nazi officer with whom some theological ideas are posed, namely, the role of Judas in salvation. The nazi officer is portrayed as having reconciled his stance within a Christian context by casting Judas as having a positive role in salvific history. His purported piety is such that he is shown inside the church, genuflecting and making the sign of the cross. The implication is that he has been privately and piously praying , an implication that imports a measure of assumed contemplation. The fact that an adherent of an evil philosophy such as Nazism could accomodate a purported veneration within a Catholic religious tradition, I found, almost blasphemous. This is a case where, in accordance with Catholic doctrine, the nazi would not be able to receive communion without confession, and to do so would have been a blasphemy, yet he is shown as being traditionally religious, with no conflict between the two, diametrically opposed, and mutually exclusive, belief systems. While there may have existed devoutly Catholic nazis, the more likely scenario would have been an anti-Catholic, both by the numerical balance in Germany and by the obvious conflict between the two. The film, of course, attempts to resolve this conflict by the identification of the nazi with Judas - a nice idea, but another that is inherently unbelievable. If the nazi was honest enough with himself so as to recognise himself as betraying his Christian beliefs, then he is hardly going to cast himself as Judas. This is more like a dramatic trick or device than one that speaks of truth. In fact, the juxtaposition of good and evil in the dialogue I found artificial and rather old fashioned.

If this had been the only flaw, i would not have been so harsh. However, my major complaint with the script is the insertion of what could only be a modern issue - that of the alleged 'silence' of Pope Pius XII. I say that it could only be a modern issue, because, prior to the production of the play, 'The Deputy', in 1962, by Rudolph Hocht, an ex Nazi and member of the KGB, there was no allegation of 'silence' on the part of Pius XII. 'The Deputy' had been commissioned by the KGB who saw the Catholic Church as their major threat and wished to denigrate the role of Pius XII as a means of undermining its authority. As it was, unfortunately for them, initially performed within the recent memory of people who had been alive in the war and experienced it first-hand, the play met riotous opposition and died a well-deserved death, until resurrected by self-appointed Catholic, John Cornwell, in 'Hitler's Pope'. There are numerous books that will demonstrate the defamatory nature of this allegation against Pius XII and which show the irony that the one person who did the most for the Jews is the person pilloried; books such as Rabbi Dalin's defence of Pius, Pinchas Lapide's defence and the documents released by the Vatican, discussed by Thomas. The fact is, Pius was seen by the world as the one person who did speak out - hence the fact that the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra gave a personal performance for Pius XII in the Vatican immediately following the war to say thank you for his actions to save the Jews.
In fact, the priests were interned in Dachau precisely because Pius was speaking out. There is no way that a discussion would have occurred between priests during the war, regarding his alleged 'silence'. It was not a case of 'he kept silent for this or that reason' - He was not silent. The true situation was stated in the memoirs of Abbe Bernard - the very memoirs that are the purported subject of this film, as follows:
'The detained priests trembled every time news reached us of some protest by a religious authority, but particularly the Vatican. We all had the impression that our warders made us atone heavily for the fury these protests evoked. Whenever the way we were treated became more brutal, the Protestant pastors amongst the prisoners used to vent their indignation on the Catholic priests: 'Again your big naive Pope and those simpletons, your bishops, are shooting their mouths off. Why don't they get the idea once and for all and shut up? They play the heroes and we have to pay the bill.'""
This entry reveals the true reality, first, that there was no doubt on the part of the protagonist about the position of the Pope and the Church vis-a-vis the nazis. Second, that there was, at the time, no doubt by the world because the Pope did not keep quiet. This entry is in the book itself which is the subject of the film, and it is this, in my view, unnecessary, distortion of the true state of affairs for the purpose of dramatic conflict, that I find irritating because of a sloppiness in exploring real, perhaps more dramatic, truths. I find it more than merely irritating though, as I am aware of the distortion of the truth and how this distortion becomes part of the dialogue, and the collective memory of an event in history. It is for this reason that I believe the director had a duty to go the extra step and make a dramatic film of the actual events as they really happened.",1466985600,4,6198,4.685321100917431

Although this was a relatively inexpensive item, without them I can't use the flag pole light I have.  Being Retired Military, this is an important issue for me.",1448064000,,768,4.5
