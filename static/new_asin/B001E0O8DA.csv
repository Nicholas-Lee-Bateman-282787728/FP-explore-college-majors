3544812,5,B001E0O8DA,"As a dedicated spy nut, I was ecstatic when I heard that Get Smart was being released on DVD at last. Even with the anticipation, the set still managed to exceed my expectations. The box is set up to look like the elevator Max disappears into during the title credits. In addition to sharp, bright and clean episode quality, each season is loaded with extras, including commentary from both Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, numerous documentaries, a touching clip from Don Adams' memorial service and commentary from Barbara Feldon before EACH EPISODE. The set also includes the black and white pilot episode which I had never seen before. In short, this sucker is loaded. Nick at Nite hasn't shown Get Smart for years now, so those of you going through advanced cases of Max and 99 withdrawl can have your Get Smart cravings satisfied forever with this great set. Here's hoping the set will soon be more widely available so Amazon can offer it at its usual rock-bottom price.",1166140800,43,970,4.745562130177515

The backs of the affected DVD's were clean and unscratched, but I suspect the problem was due to a manufacturing defect in the data layer and poor quality control that let such unplayable discs ship.  If all the episodes played, I would have rated it 5 stars, but as it is, buyers should beware of poor quality discs.",1470873600,2,474,4.564705882352941

3544828,5,B001E0O8DA,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""Get Smart"" was one of those series.  Mel Brooks and Buck Henry wanted to write a spy spoof series with a lead character that was a cross between James Bond and Inspector Clouseau.  They certainly succeeded with the classic character of Control Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, played to perfection by Don Adams. Don Adams was so good that he won three Emmy Awards for his portrayal of the bumbling, clumsy, and ultimately successful secret agent.  Max's love interest was provided by Control Agent 99, played by former model, Barbara Feldon.  Her character married Max in the fourth season, yet her real name was never given.  The frustrated Chief of Control was played by Edward Platt.  His interactions with Max formed the basis for much of the show's humor.  That's also where the most famous catchphrase from the show emanated, ""Sorry about that, Chief!""  Other notable Control Agents included Hymie the Robot (Dick Gautier), Agent 44 (Victor French), and Agent 13 (Dave Ketchum).  The role of Agent Larabee, played by Don Adams' cousin Robert Karvelas, was expanded in the fifth season, to great comedic effect.  In fact, Agent Larabee  spoke the last lines of dialogue in the last episode of the original series.

The opposite of control is chaos.  Thus, the evil organization that tried to destroy Control was named KAOS.  Bernie Kopell, a master of mimicking dialects, played Siegfried, the Vice President in charge of Public Relations and Terror at KAOS.  His right-hand-man Shtarker was humorously played by King Moody.  Other notable KAOS agents included Mr. Big (Michael Dunn), the Claw (Leonard Strong), and Simon the Likeable (Jack Gilford).  This complete series box set was expertly assembled, beginning with the packaging, resembling a phone booth in a vault.  The episodes are remastered in vibrant colors, with each season packaged separately.  What really sets this box set apart are the bonus features included in each season.  There are audio commentaries, bloopers, interviews with Buck Henry, Barbara Feldon and Bernie Kopell, clips from Emmy Award shows, footage from Don Adams' 75th birthday roast at the Playboy mansion, and even footage from Don Adams' Memorial Service.  I was able to watch the entire box set in one night.  Would you believe it?  Would you believe I was able to watch it all in one week?  How about over the course of a month and a half?  You better believe that ""Get Smart"" was one of the best sitcoms in television history.  I wanted to write a really intelligent review of the ""Get Smart"" complete series box set.  Missed it by that much!",1456790400,,2714,4.946902654867257

3544835,5,B001E0O8DA,"What a great spy spoof from some of the greatest masters of parody, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry! Mel Brooks has gone on to become a favorite of parodies of such movies as Frankenstein, Robin Hood, Star Wars (Spaceballs), Westerns (Blazing Saddles), Hitchcock (High Anxiety), etc. He started in the TV biz, along with Henry, with Get Smart, a spoof of the James Bond films. This is classic stuff.

Too much has already been said for me to add anything meaningful, so I won't even try, but this is really funny old stuff. Younger folks may not get this, as much of the humor is dated. But then, I don't get the newer stuff which is nothing more than sex, sex and more sex. Modern TV has certainly degenerated into sex. That's sad. Get Smart is truly funny on a level that doesn't stoop to sex to be funny. For that, I will always be grateful to shows like Get Smart.

Packaging is a bright idea but overly complex such that it makes getting the disc out of the box hard.  Discs are well secured though.

The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of sound glitches.  The episodes so far have been fine, but all the Barbara Feldon intros are cut off before she finishes talking (very disappointing), and the end of the show trailers are also cut of just before the end of the music.  Neither of these impacts actual enjoyment of the shows.  But what has happened to quality control these days?",1443830400,,556,4.455445544554456

1. The set comes in great packaging it opens just like the show getting to the phone booth.
2. Some people complained that the DVD's set was hard to remove from the packaging, I did not find this to be the case just turn the box upside down and tilt forward allowing the DVD disc set to come out.
2. I checked each disk for cracks and scratches as some people said the disks were loose, cracked or scratched all of them looked in new good condition. Picture quality is great.
3. Some people complained all the episodes were all in black and white this is not the case the 1st episode was made and is in black and white but the others are in color the reason the 1st episode is in black and white is because the original was filmed that way.
4, The gift set is well worth the money if you enjoyed the original series.",1443312000,4,935,4.229050279329609

What did surprise me is something I hadn't noticed when I saw the series originally in my teens and later in reruns.  It's ALL ""FORMULA comedy"".  (Mel Brooks was one of the show's creators.) That worked well in the 60's, but nowadays it gets tiring pretty quickly.

3544870,5,B001E0O8DA,"Does not playback on Linux due to Bad Blocks/Sectors Copyright Protection.  (ie. Possibly ARccOS Protection)  (Now resolved as of 2015.08.05!  See update footnotes below.  Playback via MPlayer and Xine is now problem free!)

I think I've found a (rather tedious) workaround.  Use either dvdbackup or vlc to first make a copy of the DVD, and only then can you play back the video on Linux.  Disc one is the only disc so far without the inaccessible (ARccOS) protection.  Maybe they omitted disc one having (ARccOS) protection, to get the product through quality control?  Why else would somebody omit such a restrictive copyright protection scheme on the first disc, as I've heard some DVD players do not accept such restrictive copyright protection schemes.

Most times I just want to watch DVD movies and toss them back into their cases.  Other times, such as these long TV series, I prefer to temporarily cache to hard drive for watching each show sequentially at night without having to (again) insert each DVD repetitively more than 100 times.  (Similar to having to enter a combination to a safe, when you know you're going to be inside the safe five minutes later.)  I hate it when people force the innocent to jump hurdles just to enjoy a product they've purchased.  Almost like buying a product with foreign instructions, but you need to read the foreign instructions each time you try to use the product!

Pros:
1) A great TV Series
2) Has Barbara Feldon interesting facts preceding each show.
3) Additional literature inside each series.
4) If you love packaging gimmicks, then this one deserves an A+.
5) The TV series deserves an A+ for showing off 1960-1970's suit styles.  Look no further than Maxwell Smart for how to dress appropriately!
6) Includes lots of additional video material from Emmys, birthday parties, and interviews.

Cons:
1) DVD recording studio used an incompatible DRM protection or likely something called ARccOS Protection, preventing Linux users from enjoying the recorded material.  Forget simply using a software player such as MPlayer or Xine.  You'll first likely be required to copy the material to hard drive first using dvdbackup or VLC.  (Hopefully by the time you're reading this comment, ARccOS or the copyright protection used for these DVDs will be added to MPlayer and Xine.)  (Now resolved as of 2015.08.05!  See update footnotes below.  Playback via MPlayer and Xine is now problem free!)

2) Due to how the multiple DVD's are packaged laying atop of one another within the plastic trays, the DVD's are easily scratched.  I was able to call Amazon.com customer service and they sent another boxed DVD set out for replacing the scratched DVD's and then returning the bad DVD's.  However Season 4 Disc 2 was also scratched within the boxed set as well.  Since this is the only remaining scratched DVD, I opted to buy the Season 4 DVD, and also noticed the individually packaged DVD series now have fixed DVD packaging trays entirely averting overlapping and scratching.

As they say, at least be thankful there is a workaround, since the idiot thieves are spoiling the products for the hard workers and manufacturers want to exploit the most restrictive copyright protection possible.  Brings to mind, maybe the manufacturers and publishers should really try to get smart?

UPDATE 2015.07.08:  After watching the first season, I'm really enjoying this DVD bundle.  Toward the end of the first season, they've added many (unfinished) clippings or anything that could be construed as valuable to the fans of the Get Smart show.  A good sign they left nothing out of this bundle!  (ie. Some publishers get itchy when they see unfinished material; but in the eyes of fans, the unfinished bits of material appear as real gems!)  As far as getting around the DVD protection on Linux based computer systems for viewing or enjoying the material (one time), I'm finding I have a solution using dvdbackup (ie. http://dvdbackup.sourceforge.net/) and this maybe because somebody with a higher power might just want me to copy the entire DVD bundle to hard drive.  Albeit, I've never had a need to copy any other DVD material in the past to a hard drive, unless the content were musical or audio content.  Cheers fans of Get Smart!  Hopefully you're enjoying the DVD bundle as I am!

UPDATE 2015.08.04:  After watching the entire first and second season DVDs, I cannot stand giving only four stars due to inaccessible copyright protection.  I've added full five stars.  I still say the (ARccOS?) copyright is a bit over the top, as how many locks do you need on a CD/DVD to prove copyright protection was circumvented?  Anyways, I'm not thoroughly ""loving it"" or loving the DVD series.  It's such a wonderful work of art, aside from the (ARccOS?) copyright protection scheme.  (Whomever watched added the copyright protection obviously never watched the Get Smart TV series!)  Added several more Pros and clarified Con, as well as increasing to five stars.

UPDATE 2015.08.05: After rebuilding some libraries as of Sunday (ie. libdvdread-5.0.3, libdvdnav-5.0.3, mplayer-1.2_pre2015073, ...) I'm now finally able to view the DVDs without apparent problems of copyright protection.  However at the same time, I now found a huge scratch/knick in several of the center placed DVDs of the season folders.  Thankfully, Amazon.com readily is sending a replacement.  Since it's impossible to watch or verify every DVD within several days, I'll continue with the previous method I've already been using for enjoying the DVDs, and only took a few hours.  So as of now, the copyright protection method I previously reported now appears completely resolved within MPlayer and Xine!

UPDATE 2015.09.05: Noted multiple scratched DVD's within the original boxed set.  Also noted the individually packaged series DVD's now contain fixed packaging averting overlapping and preventing scratching.",1434672000,,5914,5.087227414330218

3544920,5,B001E0O8DA,"This DVD set is very nice.  The disks are well packed in hard clear plastic book leaf containers. The plastic is a bit brittle so care must be taken to place the disk on the molded plastic spindle or else it will break.  There is a plastic jacket that surrounds the plastic disk book.  The construction is sort of cheap but I have seen much worse.  The disks are well protected and should not be easily scratched in normal careful use and storage.

Video quality is good to great at a 9 out of ten for  video quality.  I looked at this video on a 55 inch samsung 240 MHz flat panel display.  The picture was not grainy or faded.  The colors were crisp and clear.  Not much movement distortion.  The blacks were black and the whites were white.  The colors were vivid and sharp withoout fade.  Skin tones were accurate.  The audio was very good again in the 9 out of 10 with ten being execelent.  There was no noise or hum.  The voices and sound effects were clear without distortion.  The sound level was good meaning you did not have to turn sound volume to high just to hear what was going on.  The DVD's are standard reflective format not the blue disks that seem to damage easily.

Of course Maxwell Smart Agent 86 was awesome and anyone who knows Maxwell Smart hardly needs me to tell them this was some of the best comedy ever.  The Infamous Hare Bunny and Zeigfried were my favorite Kaos vilians. I grew up with Maxwell Smart Agent 86 and Miss 99 so yes for me this was a must have TV series.  The best thing about this Get Smart was it was made at a time when Seasons had a huge number of quality episodes so viewing was and is an immense pleasure.",1417392000,4,1656,4.243589743589744

The individual packaging is also very nice, with the DVD's securely placed in plastic, none were displaced upon arrival, and all appear to be scratch free. The bonus features are AWESOME, from the introductions by Barbara Feldon, to the extra features provided by writer/creators, the reunion panel from 2003 which Don Adams participated in, bloopers, commercial spots, etc. DEFINITELY worth the money spent, and the hours of laughs I am getting with my child now watching this excellent blast from the past. :)",1416873600,,935,4.742331288343558

3544927,5,B001E0O8DA,"As a child of the sixties, I grew up on Get Smart and the zany adventures of Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL. Back then, I mostly liked the really bad jokes and catch phrases... which I still adore. But now, as an adult, I can appreciate the parodies and the more subtle (by comparison, at least) aspects of the humor. But chances are that if you're considering buying this set, you already feel much the same way I do about the show. So let's talk quality of the set.

The episodes themselves look as bright and clear as they did when they first aired back in the sixties. But this is what we would all hope for as a basic minimum.  So why five stars? In a word, it's the extras.

Each episode is introduced by 99 herself, Barbara Feldon, with a brief, witty line or two. These intros are mostly setting up what you're going to see, though a few of them contain trivia nuggets, as well. Selected episodes can also be viewed with commentary by the writer or director or one of the actors. In addition to this, each season includes one disc of special features. There are interviews, deleted scenes, bloopers, short documentaries on various aspects of production, trailers, guest appearances on other shows, and even the infamous commercial that brought Barbara Feldon to the attention of the producers.

If you remember the Cold War, if you love painful puns, if you're a sucker for a good tag line, if James Bond parodies make you laugh out loud, or if you love Don Adams in any of his iconic roles, do yourself a favor and get this series.

3544946,4,B001E0O8DA,"The show is excellent. Hilarious and many episodes to watch. I figure if you are looking at buying this then you already know that and are curious about packaging. Well it comes well wrapped in a box with very fancy doors similar to what you see at the end of each episode. While this looks good it can be a pain getting the individual seasons out, at least until you get 1 or 2 out of the way. I'd say the packaging is very well done. Now as far as the disks go I would say that they could have been better taken care of. I've played through most of season 1 without any issue but then again my disks for the first season look great. I have noticed maybe 3 or 4 in later seasons with some sort of residue on them. I've seen this before on other sets and it will likely cause some hang ups but might be able to be cleaned off. Overall the company should have done a much better job with the dvds. I can only assume that many places are just trying to pump out dvds of shows before Blu-ray sweeps everything away and thus the laxed quality control. Overall a great show but be prepared for some possible issues.",1410220800,,1110,4.119815668202765

3544953,4,B001E0O8DA,"In the popular era of sixties secret agents, Get Smart was a spoof of James Bond types long before Austin Powers ever entered the picture.  Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) worked for CONTROL a secret government organization that fought evil wrongdoers, most of whom worked for rival organization KAOS.  His female cohort was known simply as Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his boss was the Chief (Edward Platt).  Early on when the show was fresh it spawned several catchphrases such as Sorry about that, Chief and Would you Believe...?.  It also featured several running gags that became famous like The Cone of Silence and Maxs shoe phone.  After a couple of years, it all started to get repetitious and the writers started making desperate moves like marrying off Max and Agent 99, and then having 99 give birth to twins.  The show changed networks in the final season in a last chance desperation move that only lasted a year.  Every episode had its funny moments, though personally I would stick to the early episodes.",1407283200,,1014,4.826589595375722
3544954,5,B001E0O8DA,"Get Smart is a timeless classic from the 1960s of the dysfunctionality of the American security agencies. I have seen every episode. Don Adams is the bumbling, accident-prone CONTROL agent 86, Maxwell Smart; his sidekick, by contrast, agent 99, played by Barbara Feldon, is an attractive, intelligent and resourceful companion. The show is full of famous catch phrases and cliches. Edward Platt (the Chief), Robert Karvelas (Larabee), Dick Gautier (Hymie, the CONTROL robot), Bernie Kopell (Ziegfried), Fang (Smart's canine friend); Victor French (as Agent 44) and a plethora of famous 1960s actors provide a stellar performance. There is also a guest appearance by the late Australian actor, Michael Pate. It was very affordably priced. Some of the episodes mimic the plots of Ian Fleming, one of the authors of the many James Bond novels. The product is extremely well-packaged. Each season collection exudes bright colours, and displays youthful images of Don and Barbara.

3544972,5,B001E0O8DA,"""Get Smart - The Complete Series Gift Set"" is wonderful as a gift for yourself (all of us baby-boomer 1960's long-time fans) and for newer generations that are not familiar with this excellent show.  This gift set contains all five seasons, and many extras on 25 discs (including episode intros by the vivacious Barbara Feldon).  The humor holds up extremely well (unlike many 60's shows).  Originally conceived by the genius' of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry (which should give you an idea of the type of humor involved).

  ""GET SMART"" is smartly written and acted by a talented group of cast and crew, and even funny cameos by film/tv stars (which shows you how popular the show was over five years). Don Adams is at his best as the secret agent who's not much a secret, and not much of an agent (but he always gets the job done, with dignity somewhat intact).

  Enjoy the wonderful chemistry of Don Adams and Barbara Feldon (agents ""86"" and ""99"" respectively), with an incredibly zany cast of semi-serious, likeable characters(both hero and villan). Above all the chaos (and trying to keep everything under control) is the the dead-pan serious, long-suffering Chief of Control: the delightful Edward Platt.  The show's terrific spoof of the James Bond legend (and Pink Panther's Inspector Clouseau), ""GET SMART"" is consistently funny (and many times hilarious).  Get smart and do yourself a favor and buy ""Get Smart - The Complete Series Gift Set"".

  So call all your family and friends on your ""shoe-phone"", then sit back (maybe not eating popcorn - you'll be choking from laughter), and enjoy this complete collection of one of the best laugh-out-loud comedys of all time!",1376697600,2,1676,4.897163120567376

It's been a great pleasure to watch these episodes play in sequence. The best episodes set a standard for TV satire. But the real reward of this box set is the extras, especially for fans of the show. Extended interviews with creative principals like Buck Henry and Leonard Stern provide a window into their methods. A panel discussion with Adams, Feldon, Kopell, and a number of producers offers both insight and sentimental value.

3545000,4,B001E0O8DA,"My wife has been begging me to get this set for her ever since the original series was released to DVD. I had been putting it off due to the high cost, but when the price came down a little, I decided to pull the trigger and get it for her birthday.

The design effort put into the packaging is quite clever... set up like the opening sequence with the phone booth and  the security doors. However, once you get past all the cardboard doors it is impossible to remove the inner DVD cases without damaging the inside edges of the inner box. The 5 full season DVD cases are designed with the same theme, folding open one door at a time revealing each DVD behind another security door! However, the ""Top Secret"" table of contents documents tucked inside the front flap inside each of the  DVD boxes were not inserted properly so they were all bent and folded on the edges. For all the engineering that went into the concept of this package, it was a little disappointing to see the somewhat poorly manufactured and assembled presentation. Someday this set could be a collectors item  and the wear and tear on the box  trying to remove and replace the DVD cases will bring down the value!

Each episode starts with an introduction narrated by Barbara Feldon. The volume level and audio quality of each introduction is very poor and makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. Once the episode starts, the Audio and video quality are quite good. Again, a small detail that was overlooked in the production for this set.

The last disk inside each DVD case contains the added bonus material. They are interesting and informative but some of them are repeated on more than one of the DVD sets. The only reason I can find for the repeated bonus material is that each season was probably originally produced for individual sale and just thrown together for the entire series box set.

For someone who has purchased other complete sets like the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, I was a  little disappointed with the way it was apparently  ""thrown together"" in some respects for the money.

I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for this reason.",1353024000,3,2129,4.547120418848167

3545005,5,B001E0O8DA,"When this DVD box set first came out it was going for $199. I always loved the show, but the price tag was a bit steep for me. Now that it is going for $69 I bought it and I must say that it is just as funny as I remembered.

Not only do you get all 138 shows produced during its 5 year run, but you get commentary and behind the scenes info that brings the show into a new light. There are outtakes, bloopers and a 2002 TV interview with most of the writers, producers, and of course, Don Adams and Barbara Felden.

I particularly enjoyed the episode from the Bill Dana show where Don Adams plays the hotel detective. It was during this period in Don's career that he developed what would eventually become the famous character Maxwell Smart Agent 86.

The Box Set is nicely packaged to look like the introduction of each show. As you open it up you eventually get to the phone booth. Behind the phone booth door you will find 5 nicely packaged boxes with 5 DVDs in each box and a summary pamphlet describing what is on each disc and written commentary by a major player from the show. The pamphlets are nicely produced with photos and plenty of information.

You can watch the DVDs in their entirety or select to watch one episode at a time. If you choose to watch each episode one at a time you will get a brief commentary by Barbara Felden on the behind the scenes information on that particular episode. Did you know that Don Adams famous ""Shoe Phone"" is on display at the Reagan Presidential Library? You would know that and much more if you buy this Box Set. I highly recommend this special edition Box Set.

If you don't buy it would you believe a Highly Trained SWAT team will descend on your home? How about a couple of Squad Cars? Would you believe a couple of angry Girl Scouts with sharp fingernails? No? Buy it anyway; you won't regret it.",1329782400,5,1853,4.2979942693409745
3545006,5,B001E0O8DA,"Worth every penny. The comic timing is perfect. Some references are dated, but it doesn't matter, it is still very funny. The quality of the discs and the packaging is fantastic. Crisp DVD transfer and a bunch of rare bonus included.",1328745600,,233,4.7073170731707314
3545007,5,B001E0O8DA,"In the `50's and `60's there was a huge surge in interest for spy and espionage movies. After the Nazi threat had ended at the end of the World War 2, the Red Scare began and everyone thought eyes were everywhere. It was in 1953 that James Bond first appeared in Ian Fleming's novels and in 1962 Sean Connery immortalized him on the big screen. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. became a hit in 1964, and by this time the spy boom had become big enough to warrant a parody. It was with that in mind that Talent Associates approached Mel Brooks (The Producers) and Buck Henry (The Graduate) to create a spy spoof TV show.

In my home growing up the `50's and `60's were always playing on television. Here I became well versed in the cinematic exploits of John Wayne through films like El Dorado and McLintock! Back in the day when Nick at Nite, and later TV Land, actually played shows from before I was born rather than stuff that I recall watching when it first aired (making me feel really old) we would watch shows like Mister Ed, Dennis the Menace, The Munsters, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched, etc. The favorite show around the house was The Andy Griffith Show. It was during this time that I became enamored with Brooks and Henry's creation Get Smart.

Get Smart follows a bungling secret agent named Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) who works for the secret spy organization CONTROL as he fights the secret spy organization KAOS which is based out of Bucharest, Romania but says it's out of Delaware for tax purposes. Despite being somewhat inept Max is the top spy at CONTROL, largely thanks to his much more competent female partner Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and the fact that the spies at KAOS are equally inept. Together Max and 99 fight foes like Mr. Big (Michael Dunn), Siegfried (Bernie Kopell), The Claw (Leonard Strong, and often pronounced Dr. Craw), and Simon the Likeable (Jack Gilford) who is so likeable that no one can resist his charms.

Okay, let's be honest, I'm sure none of you out there considered the idea that Get Smart would place #1 on my top 10 TV shows list. Hell, TV in the 60's wasn't even respected as it is today and I'm a critical kind of guy; of course, the fact that TV wasn't respected doesn't mean that it didn't pump out some brilliant shows. The Andy Griffith Show was a brilliant show and before Lost there was Gilligan's Island (yeah, I went there), but neither show was on the same level of Get Smart. I also enjoy any show that works to subvert the already established order, and at that time, when this was largely Brooks's baby back before he even made a flick, this show changed some of the rules of television.

At the time comedies still focused a lot on family, so there was interest from the producers to give the show some heart by adding scenes with Max's family. This, of course, was nixed by Brooks, and as a result never in the series do we meet Max's parents. There was also a request for a lovable dog to be added to the series. This request was accepted in the form of the lazy and inept spy dog Fang, which worked for comedic effect. There was also the fact that Maxwell Smart is quite an idiot, which was something that was new for this kind of show. Brooks turned the idea of what a half hour sitcom was and changed it up, but not without a little bit of turmoil. When being shopped around to networks ABC rejected it for being un-American.

In the end Smart would have the last laugh though. It ran its first four seasons on NBC, and switched over to CBS for its final season. Throughout its run it earned Emmy awards for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Comedy for Don Adams three years in a row, Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy, Outstanding Comedy Series two years in a row, and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy. In 1989, ABC would air a direct to TV movie titled Get Smart, Again, and in 1995 the series was rebooted on Fox with Don Adams reprising his role as Maxwell Smart acting as chief of CONTROL and Andy Dick playing his bungling son. While the reboot of the series was nowhere near the excellence of the original series, it did make Get Smart the first show to appear on all four of the major TV networks.

3545024,5,B001E0O8DA,"As a kid in the 1960s I was at the right place at the right time to view the very first broadcasts of a number of now-classic television shows. I saw the early second episode of the original ""Outer Limits,"" the first episode of ""Lost in Space,"" the first broadcast episode of ""Star Trek,"" and yes, the very first ""Get Smart."" ""Get Smart"" was one of my favorites and provided us a lot of fun back then. Watching the original '60s series now as an adult is even more fun, because I understand a lot of the humor and references I didn't grasp as a kid.

Unfortunately, as with many television shows, when they try to do a reunion movie or revive the series, they usually don't get what made the original series appealing. I've seen a couple of ""Get Smart"" reunion movies and watched the FOX revival in the '90s (which I give two stars as opposed to five stars to the orginal), but unless you're just a die-hard fan I would recommend forking over the bucks to get the complete original series. It's hilarious.

That's not to say the reunions and revival didn't have their moments. To my taste, one of the funniest scenes in one of the reunion movies is when some archenemy has Max and 99 chained to a wall, and they're saying something about Congress appropriating money for a government program designed to get kids to read. The evil genius laughs and says, ""And you call ME mad!""

And I love the scene in the '90s revival with evil ex-KAOS agent Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) when his daughter finally discovers to her dismay that her father is a spy. She says, ""My father deceived me. All these years he told me he was a doctor on a cruise ship!""",1291939200,5,1641,4.409240924092409

So when word got out in 2007 that it was finally FINALLY coming to DVD, I jumped at the chance to own it. I must say, kudos to HBO Video for lovingly packaging Get Smart, from its groovy 60's-flavored design to the crisp DVD transfer to all the rare bonus goodies included. Certain episodes stick out in memory (""One of Our Olives is Missing"", ""To Sire with Love, parts I & II"", ""Only Two 99"", etc.). But it was great to get reacquainted with them all, from start (""Mr. Big"", the only GS episode in black & white) to finish (""I Am Curiously Yellow"", in which Larrabee gets the last laugh). GS was such a perfect showcase for the comedic genius of Don Adams, who coined such great catchphrases throughout that are well remembered today. And let's not forget the wonderful chemistry he had with great supporting players Barbara Feldon & Edward Platt. Revisiting GS, it's a no-brainer that it was created by Mel Brooks & Buck Henry. Particularly by Brooks, as the series benefited from his zany logic (who would've dreamed up shoe phones or other daffy CONTROL gadgets??). Other characters, such as the strangely dense Larrabee (Adams' real life cousin Robert Karavelas), Hymie the Robot (Dick Gautier was terrific in the role), and KAOS nemesis Siegfried (a brilliantly manic Bernie Kopell) are but a few who helped populate the wacky spy world of GS.

For those of you who only know of Maxwell Smart from the recent movie, let me start by saying the series is a million times better. Don't believe me? Would you believe a thousand? No, OK, probably like a hundred. But that's still a hell of a lot.

Get Smart is easily one of the funniest shows to come out of the late 60's-early 70's. While the movie does it justice, it misses it by THAT much. This is slapstick spy-spoofery at its finest. Parodies of the Bond movies and just about every other spy/mystery series of the time are here and hilarious.

The entire series is here. Unlike so many TV box sets, this one doesn't skimp on the special features either. Commentary from pretty much every major living cast/crew member, award show appearances, celebrity roasts, it's all included.

The packaging looks like the doors leading into Control HQ, which gives the set a unique, possibly collectible exterior. This set is cheaper than the identical one released by TimeLife, so that's a plus.

Overall, this is one of the best box sets of a TV series I've ever plunked down the cash for. If you like classic comedy, it doesn't get much better than this. Five out of five stars.",1275868800,,1190,4.568075117370892

Don't get me wrong, I love that it comes in a phone booth, but it is sometimes difficult to get the individual seasons in and out and it it can be hard to get the plastic sleeves back on them, too.

I am absolutely amazed at how awesome and cool this DVD set is. I don't know why a previous reviewer said that the packaging was hard to open, there is a little tab at the top of the box to show you that you have to pull it out. Then once you get that door down you have to pull up on a door and then open the telephone doors. it's very cool and pays tribute to the opening credits of the show. Each episode starts with an introduction by Barbara Feldon who gives you a summary of the episode you're about to watch. I can't wait to rewatch the entire series and watch all the bonus features. I was a bit hesitant to buy the series at full price so I bought the single season release. After viewing the production value of the series set I have to recommend buying this instead of the single releases of the season.

3545034,2,B001E0O8DA,"Warning: contains ""packaging spoliers!""

The set is great.  But the packaging is terrible!

The set is divided into five fold-out packages, one for each season.  They are all housed in a big outer box.  First, it is not at all obvious how to open the box.  I didn't mind the ""riddle,"" and solved it fairly quickly, but I question the wisdom of making it so hard to get to the product you just bought.

Then, once you get the package open, you can't get any of the five inner packages out!  The reason is that the parts of the outer box that fold down and fold up are not cut flush with the edge of the box, so they don't allow the inner packages to slide out.  I had to take a pair of scissors to mine.

Next, each of the inner packages has nothing to identify it.  They are different colors, yes.  But I don't intend to memorize which color goes with which season.  Especially five years from now when I want to watch a particular show again.

Each inner package comes inside a plastic sleeve that surrounds it on four of its six sides -- it slides out of the top or the bottom of the sleeve.  One of the sleeves in my set was completely split open, so it just flopped off the package.  One other is split about halfway down one edge.  The problem with this is that the sleeve is the only thing that identifies which season the package contains.  So you have to keep the sleeves on the packages, or try to, even when they break and fall off, or you will never be able to tell which season is which.

Once you fold out the inner package, the disks are stacked two per section, so you have to pop out disk 1, for example, before you can pop out disk 2 and put it in your DVD player.  Where are you supposed to put disk 1 in the meantime?  Then you have to put disk 1 back while you're playing disk 2.  But then you have to take it out again to put disk 2 back when you're finished playing it.  Terrible design!

And woe be unto you if you lose the folded paper insert that falls out onto the floor every time you flip the package open.  If you lose it, you'll never know what's on any of the disks from that season.  It's the only place there is any listing of the disk contents.  The outer box has no listing of any kind, nor do the outsides of the inner packages (which have no words on them at all).  Nor does the inside of the folded out inner package.  All you get is the folded paper insert.

At least the disks are single-sided.

A couple of comments about the quality:  the colors are amazingly bright and crisp for a show that was shot 45 years ago, and the episodes are not full of video background noise.  I found out why in one of the ""bonus material"" interviews: the show was shot on film and not videtape.  Season 1 and Season 2 are by far the best.  I wonder if they switched to videotape for Season 3 -- it's noticeably the worst.  Seasons 4 and 5 are better, but still not as good as 1 and 2.

Sound is great, not muffled or garbled.  Set is closed-captioned.",1269129600,13,2975,4.109565217391304

Seriously, if you're a Get Smart fan, you can't lose with this set. All the episodes are mastered in fairly good quality. There several commentaries per season and each season has an extras disc that mostly consists of interviews and past clips from awards shows and comments from the studio (lawyers?) on how to change certain scenes so that they don't get in trouble. The extras really were just that to me. I watched them all, but didn't really care for them, but the episodes were great.

The only thing I would've liked more of is commentaries. Unfortunately, the making of this set and when the show ended was so long ago that it made it difficult for the commentators to give insightful information about most of the episodes. In general, Barbara Feldon did a bunch of commentaries and she gave a lot of good comments. The worst one was when she teamed up with Buck Henry:  Neither one of them really remembered the episode. Also, based on the comments, I think that the episode they teamed up to comment on, Buck Henry wasn't even around for, so they got distracted talking about other things instead. Buck Henry did a few other commentaries by himself and they were good, but more so because of what he said and not so much of what it had to do with the particular episode. Overall, if you can get it at a discount or as an Amazon's ""Gold Box"" deal, it's a great value. I got one for myself and for my brother.

3545049,5,B001E0O8DA,"I've done so many reviews lately that where in a negative spotlight, that I was starting to wonder if I could say anything nice in my reviews anymore, and thought, I haven't done Get Smart, and there is absolutely nothing I can say that's bad about this set other then it's about time it finally got released.

Get Smart is one of the classic 60's TV shows that started out as a parody of the recently new to the time, James Bond films. Agent 86 was brought in as the lovable, clumsy and funny beady eyed spy for Control, named Maxwell Smart. Serving on the forces of good for a secret agency against the evil forces of KAOS.

Max was equipped with technology that was for a 60's series, somewhat futuristic gadgets... younger viewers watching today probably would think nothing about Max's shoe phone, however they did not really come into the real world for another 15-20 years or so. But the viewers before those time periods would still remembered this show as having these cool gadgets that even today some people wonder if this show had access to future plans of technology, or where the inspiration for it themselves.

A fact that surprisingly comes as a disbelief to some people is that this show was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. Not so much the Buck Henry bit, but the Mel Brooks part. It's always been there clear as day in front of people in the opening credits, but for some reason it's not that well known that Mel Brooks played a major hand in creating this show. But as to who and what he had a part in, I don't know, but he may have had a hand in helping form agent 99. Barbra Feldon plays Max's lovely side.... err, well, shes not a side kick, and not his partner, shes the Queen in the show I guess... how about the shows duchess?.... well, she was the shows leading lady anyway. She had the brains and the smarts (eventually later in the series) but she adores Max and is always happy to team up, rescue, go on assignment or just sit around and talk with Max as he's being briefed on a mission that he will face grave fear, death and danger at every turn, Kaos agents everywhere trying to kill him.... and... loving it!

Agent 99 is also considered to be a a big inspiration for women. Gotta remember this was the 60's, and womens movement groups where starting to rise and demand equal rights etc... many women drew inspiration from a smart, intelligent and strong minded woman who was out there doing the dangerous jobs that these men could do, while dressed to kill in the latest fashions, all while not being treated in sexist ways or having stereo type roles.

Other characters for Control are the Chief of control, the head honcho who would rather be dealing life and death moments on the field then have to put up with another session of Max requesting top secret information being told under the 'Cone of Silence', or some kind of way of communication that would go wrong.

Also other characters who appear from time to time are the Chiefs sideman Larrabee, a man who may actually be more annoying to the Chief then Max, Hymie the robot, agent 13 who appears in the most unusual places, and special guests who play agents for control and Kaos, or just a special guest playing a given role.
Also on the side of Kaos is The Loveboat's captain, Bernie Koplel (dunno how to spell it) who plays Max's German arch enemy, Siegfried the magnificent, who is never often seen without his side man Shtarker.

Over it's 6 seasons this team came into peoples home and gave high quality comedy value every week that is loved by the young and old even still to this day. And even people who have only just discovered this show, due the the recent (TERRIBLE) movie version of this series, have started to rediscover what made this show a classic.

Now onto the DVD's themselves. Some of the DVD quality is not the greatest, you will still get bits of grain and typical looks of 60's TV shows, but I really do not think there is anyone alive who could care less. It would be hard to clean up 60's footage and make it crystal clear for HD or Blue Ray or whatever. but the interesting thing, not much of this show seems to look all that dated. Sure, you can tell it was the 60's, but it doesn't look like a show that could have only been enjoyed while living in that time period. It has never run out of syndication since it began, least somewhere in the world, and hopefully never will.

Each season contains 5 discs, and the last disc is filled with bonus features from screen tests, behind the scenes footage, Emmy awards and even things like Don Adams playing poker with Hue Heffner at the Playboy Mansion. There is a lot of great bonus goodies here and the only thing bad you can say about it is it just leaves you wanting more.

On selected episodes there is also some commentaries from Barbra Feldon and Benrie K? And some others. Unfortunately there is none from Don Adams, but they try to make up for that in the bonus features with plenty of great clips to discover.

The differences between this box set and the single editions depend on what issues you get. Some are the same as whats in this box set, with just the episodes and selected commentaries, but some of the single season editions do have some bonus features on the disc that are from the 1 disc of bonus features from this one.

Get Smart has finally come to DVD, and they have not missed anything by ___ this much. There doesn't seem to be much more you could include apart from more bonus features. Tho, if you did love this series, you may want to also add to the collection, the two movies; ""The Nude Bomb"" & ""Get Smart Again"" and the 1995 series that only ran for 7 episodes also titled ""Get Smart"". The nude bomb was a movie made in about 1980 that was funny, but many dismiss it due to not having anyone else really but Don Adams, and worse yet, a different leading lady, but Get Smart Again is a terrific mid 80's Get Smart reunion movie featuring the cast members who where still around at the time or Max's non 99 love interest that I think is peoples biggest objection to the film. And then there is also the 90's series where Max is now the Chief and his, and 99's, son is the new Maxwell Smart character. The show was short lived, but it wasn't all that bad, and you should be happy with the price of it.

3545051,5,B001E0O8DA,This type of comedy is rare in today's market. To be understated and not requiring loud laughter is an art that seems to have been lost with vaudeville.

3545054,5,B001E0O8DA,"[...]

For those of you who only know of Maxwell Smart from last year's movie, let me start by saying the series is a million times better. Don't believe me? Would you believe a thousand? No, OK, probably like a hundred. But that's still a hell of a lot.

Get Smart is easily one of the funniest shows to come out of the late 60's-early 70's. While the movie does it justice, it misses it by that much. This is slapstick spy-spoofery at its finest. Parodies of the Bond movies and just about every other spy/mystery series of the time are here and hilarious.

The entire series is here, including three seasons that are not yet sold individually. That means if you want them now, you gotta buy the set (Which you can do at the top and bottom of this review: hint, hint). Unlike so many TV box sets, this one doesn't skimp on the special features either. Commentary from pretty much every major living cast/crew member, award show appearances, celebrity roasts, its all included.

The packaging looks like the doors leading into Control HQ, which gives the set a unique, possibly collectible exterior. This set cheaper than the identical one released by TimeLife, so that's a plus.

Overall, this is one of the best box sets of a TV series I've ever plunked down the cash for. If you like classic comedy, it doesn't get much better than this. Five out of five stars.",1239753600,,1365,4.532520325203252

Not to mention the wonderfully creative and durable packaging. Folks, this is a must for anyone who wants to enjoy hours of good clean and comedic fun. A Smart buy at a Smart price.

I had 10 VHS tapes full to the brim with Get Smart stuff that I had taped from the TV station here in Dallas in the late 80's, early 90's.  It took a while to edit the commercials and they weren't in order, but it was something.  These tapes have been worn out.  You must turn the sound way up to hear them and the picture is losing clarity.  I knew that someday someone would compile them into a DVD collection.  That day has finally come.  I then had to wait a while for the price to come down so I could afford it.  It finally did, and I bought the set as a birthday gift to myself.  It is worth every penny.  I have been laughing my head off.  The extras you get are very cool.  Lots of TV appearances, commercials, footage that the family submitted, really great stuff.

3545062,5,B001E0O8DA,"I ordered this from Amazon using the free shipping option on Sunday March 15 and it arrived Thursday March 19. Some of the discs were dislodged but not scratched or damaged. The disc holders were intact. The package is not flimsy. In fact it's very thick and sturdy. After you remove the shrink rap face the opening toward you. DO NOT pull the thin carboard interior out of the hard cardboard casing. The first door drops down like the back of the semi in Knight Rider. The second opening is an upper and lower doorway that opens top upwards and bottom downwards. Finally the phone booth doors. Open them outward like a double door closet. At fist getting the disc sets out is a bit of a trick, but if you carefully follow these instructions you will have a well preserved box set that you can proudly display and easily access. Go back to the double top and bottom doors where the doors meet the sturdy part of the box. This is where the problem lies. Simply fold the thin part of the doors  about a quarter of an inch toward you and carefully cut with a scissor. Do not cut the doors themselves. Yes you can just simply cut all the doors completely off, but that would kill the intended tribute of Maxwell Smart Agent 86 reporting for work. Each season is packaged in it's own box. A four section fold out with overlapping discs (my only peeve) 4 for the show and 1 for bonus features, a pamphlet with episode list, bonus features list, and anecdote from someone involved with or inspired by the show, all in a  plastic sleeve. 5 seasons 25 discs total. All episodes are English only audio and closed caption. Not subtitled. You may have to go to your dvd player's main menu (not the disc menu) to activate this option. And of course your television must have the closed caption option also. I'm not sure when TVs first offered this option, but if you have to get up and turn a circle dial by hand to change the channel you definately do not have a television with closed caption capability. Now that you know the physical applications of how to make this box set work for you, and not against you, please don't listen to the reviews of the people that didn't have the ""Smarts"" to figure it out.",1237680000,,2197,4.4088669950738915
3545063,5,B001E0O8DA,"... the entire series, each year's episodes in a colorful 1960s mod-style slip-case, loaded with extras and an intro commentary for each episode by Barbara Feldon (Agent 99) with liner notes for each season - all tucked into a heavy slipcase with a triple door opening that mimics the classic title sequence? I started laughing as soon as I opened the box.

Uncut, re-mastered in glorious color  - all but the pilot episode which was in black and white -  and loaded with extras, it's an hysterically amusing romp down TV's memory lane. ""Get Smart"" was always more than just a send-up of the whole James Bondish-007-techno-spy-cold-war-standoff genre. It sent up everything - there was no element of popular culture left unscathed by the writers and performers: everything from war movies to the  ""Wild One"",  hippies and rock music, every movie with a fiendish mastermind and out of-the way lairs, robot henchmen, incredible gadgets, beautiful and conniving female henchpersons, and ever so much more. Mention the show to people of a certain age and without fail they will recall the shoe phone and/or the cone of silence. What they might have forgotten is how many later-famous guest stars there were, and even some legends; Bob Hope showed up in a bit part as a room-service waiter; talk about stunt casting!

""Get Smart""  stands up very well, all things considered and especially considering the current television comedy on broadcast channels. I had forgotten how many catch-phrases seeped into popular culture from the ineffable, bumbling yet ultimately successful Agent 86: ""Sorry about that, Chief!"", ""Missed it by that much"", ""I told you not to tell me that!"" and ""Would you believe.....?"" Max fought for goodness and niceness, buoyed up by a serene and never shaken confidence in his own abilities. And the fact that it was sheer dumb good luck, or the timely intervention of Agent 99, or Fang, the canine agent - or something else miraculously removing his chestnuts from proximity to an intense heat source - that never dismayed Maxwell Smart for a second.

All the series episodes are here, neatly organized with each season in a separate folder, four discs of episodes and a fifth bonus-feature disc - plus a neat little four-page index. The producers in some cases have really gone the extra length in rooting out contemporary promos, appearances by stars on other shows, a birthday roast of  Don Adams at the Friars' Club, contemporary  NBC broadcast standards memos, blooper reels, Emmy Awards appearances, and more. This collection is truly a labor of love for everyone involved in putting it together.",1237680000,,2620,5.016129032258065

25 DVDs, each with multiple episodes, beautifully packaged in a box set that opens in a similar way to all the Control head quarters multiple opening secret doorways (even down to the phone booth) from the opening of each episode. If you have young children, they will have fun opening the box set, over and over again.

Nothing could be more satisfying than kicking back, hearing that amazing grooving jazz big band Get Smart theme song and watching the endless site gags and plays on words that come out of the bumbling Maxwell Smart - agent 86 played by Don Adams, Chief played by Edward Platt and the beautiful Agent 99 played by Barbara Feldon.

One of the episodes even features Leonard Nimoy (a rare glimpse of him very young with no pointy ears) as a Kaos agent working with the ""Shark"" expert pool player from Kaos, who at one point even refers to another expert pool player ""Three Fingers Yarmy"", which was actually an inside joke among the cast and production team about Don Adams real last name ""Yarmy"".

(in loving jest to Don Adams) The comic timing was priceless & to see these as an adult so I can understand the little things not caught by a child is wonderful. The producers of this set were the first that I know of (correct me if I'm wrong)  to release a full set before the individual seasons & still plan to release the seperate seasons,which I think is great & not shafting those who started collecting them 1 season at a time to see themselves stuck with partial sets with no way to complete them without dropping more money on dvds they already own...(see Dr Katz & Fraggle Rock to name just 2) Nice marketing strategy I think. Get the ones who want the whole set at once & those who want it 1 season at a time. Everyone's happy. (and though the box is awkward to open it is a cute novelty & who doesn't find themselves mumbling the theme to themselves while opening it? lol) Bottom line?

Even though I didn't ""get"" many of the political and satirical references at the time, I still enjoyed the slapstick comedy, zany gadgets and of course Don Adams' wonderfully hilarious performance as the dopey, yet lovable, Agent 86.

I was fortunate enough to have a friend tell me that this set was the Amazon gold box deal of the day, so I picked it up for $67 (looking back I wouldn't of minded paying the current price - it's worth it). I hadn't seen the show in 10+ years, so admittedly I was slightly worried that I had just bought an entire series of a show I only slightly remembered and only had fond memories of as a kid.

Don Adams leads the way in his halfway imitation of William Powell, and has everyone cracking up throughout the entire five-year run.  Barbara Feldon is wonderful as 99, and seems to get prettier as the series runs.  Edward Platt, as the Chief, is the best straight man since George Burns.

3545093,5,B001E0O8DA,"My daughter used to watch ""Get Smart"" when she was little and would laugh until she cried at Maxwell Smart. I was not a big fan of the series, but I always enjoyed watching her watch it. Her reactions were as funny as she thought the show was. On her Christmas '08 wish list was a ""Get Smart"" DVD. When she opened one of her gifts from me, the look on her face was well worth the price that I had paid.
  She gasped and then exclaimed excitedly, ""You bought me the whole series! Oh, Momma! Thank you so much!""
  I have since asked her if she has had the time to watch any of her ""Get Smart"" DVDs. She said that she watches one show every night before she goes to bed so that she can end her day with laughter. My daughter is 40 now and she says that she still thinks that Maxwell is just as funny today as she did when she was little; actually, she thinks he is funnier because she is watching as an adult this time and understands some of the subtle suggestions and remarks that she had missed as a child.
  When I first saw the price for this set, I thought it was a lot to pay for Maxwell Smart. But, After seeing her expression when she first opened her gift and then hearing how much she has enjoyed watching the movies again, it would be a bargain at twice the price. It is impossible to afix a price tag to the things we enjoy and love. To me, my daughter's happiness is priceless. One hundred dollars is a very small price to pay to give her unlimited laughter.
  If you feel as my daughter does about the ""Get Smart"" series and think Maxwell Smart is totally funny, you will love this DVD series and be happy with your purchase. My daughter and I highly recommend it.

3545101,4,B001E0O8DA,"""Get Smart"" is the American cult equivalent of shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus. I'm not suggesting it was as ground-breaking or innovative as the MP, but fans of the show know the lines and can recite them on cue. It's a spy spoof which has a bumbling main character who is 1 part James Bond and 3 parts Inspector Jaques Closseau. Most people who are interested in this set have likely already seen the show so they don't need to be told about the quality of the episodes.

In terms of the set itself, the packaging is very frustrating. The discs for each season are packed in individual boxes, but the tabs on mine were broken upon arrival and invariably one or two discs from each season's box would not stay in place. I had to put them in sleeves and keep them loosely in their boxes. The box which holds the individual season boxes has an ingenious design which is based on the show's introduction, but it's too fussy to open and close. For long-term storage, it's fine, but for frequent access, it's a real hassle.

The extras on the show and commentary are pretty good. I think that for a show this old, particularly one that has seen some of its major cast members pass away before the DVDs were made, the extras are generous.

Aside from the packaging, I can recommend this without reservation to fans of the show. If you're not a fan, but you like movies like The Naked Gun, you probably will also enjoy ""Get Smart"".",1229990400,4,1433,4.44106463878327

The packaging was very unique.  I was quite surprised that a company would go to the trouble of creating a slip case with fold out sets of doors (imitating the doors Maxwell Smart walks through in the credits).  It was a really nice touch.  Each season is packaged individually in a foldout case that slides into a clear sleeve that is decorated with Mod circles.  The foldout cases contain a booklet with an episode list and pertitent information, the episode DVDs, and a DVD containing bonus material.  The bonus material is very interesting in most cases. The first season bonus features alone contained a couple of documentaries, footage of Don Adams pre Get Smart, and an introduction to new NBC shows hosted by Don Adams in character as Maxwell Smart.

I was 12 when it first aired.  I loved it then; I love it now.  It has all the elements of real comedy with original comedy as well.  At 54, I am able to appreciate it even more for its great writing and lovable characters.  It was really a brilliant series.  Every episode is packed with Don Adams' brand of humor, Barbara Feldon's beautifully enamoured reaction to Maxwell Smart though she was probably smarter than he, Ed Platt with his lovable face and straight-man sometimes comedic delivery, Bernie Kopell's comedic timing along with Don Adams, and all the other wonderful characters created.  The commentaries are really interesting and informative.

It's witty, fun, and you will really get wrapped up in the episode.  If you feel like your laughing will send you to the floor, you better locate a phone booth (if you can).  Who knows?  You might be transported to ""Control"".

3545109,5,B001E0O8DA,"I was at Best Buy yesterday and the price was $149 and some cents. And this was their ""new store"" Nov 22, 08 sagging economy, poor sales Christmas prices. But since I've seen this happen before with the alien nation movies where Best Buy's price was also a huge amount higher.

I waited to check out the Get Smart original TV series on Amazon and saved $40. So, I'm glad I waited.

I will say that Best Buy did have the really cute 2008 Get Smart DVD case which turns into a shoe phone. I couldn't resist that.

 I'm disappointed to hear one of the other reviews that this does not have Close captioning. You don't have to be hard of hearing to use it. It works great in just allowing you to keep the TV low despite background noise in the house with people, pets, appliances and other superfluous noises. It also has the benefit of catching indistinct conversations on the show which would have been inaudible. Been using CC since 1985 and my hearing is perfect. Since CC can be done with computer translating, there's not a lot of excuse for not including CC or subtitles for viewers who would like to use it.

CC is not just for the hard of hearing. It also helps people who have trouble with English or those with short attention spans or other medical issues.

The only complaint I have about CC in general is on TV with the errant placement of the caption locations on the screen, blocking out things you are trying to see. There is no reason the networks are so sloppy in handling it. They have no problem placing crawlers at the bottom of the screen among other junk.",1227398400,2,1575,4.376712328767123

3545111,5,B001E0O8DA,"Get Smart must certainly be ranked as one of the most outstanding comedies of the 1960's.  The show was highly successful both in terms of ratings and as a social phenomenon: the series was widely quoted and mimicked, and numerous catchphrases from the series found their way into vernacular use almost immediately upon the show's inception. Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, Edward Platt, and a host of others became famous from the show, and its five-year run (on two networks, no less) was nothing less than an apogee of television for the period.

Get Smart is based on a premise that, today, perhaps holds little meaning. Maxwell Smart, secret agent ""86,"" works for a secret U.S. spy organization called ""CONTROL"" (the name is not an acronym) whose nemesis, ""KAOS"" (again, the word is a name, not an acronym) were in constant cold-war-style efforts to subvert one another. Someone once asked Max in an episode how one could tell the ""good"" spies from the ""bad"" spies. Max's answer was simple: ""The good secret agents work on OUR side; the bad secret agents work on THEIR side."" This is the basic premise of the show, a comedy based in part on the James Bond series of movies, by this point in time achieving its first international notoriety, but within the structural format of a situation comedy. This was the Cold War played out in a series of comedy vignettes, with nothing taken too seriously even if it meant the potential end of the free world once each week.

There are a number of factors which made the series so successful. As with most successful TV shows, the writing was uniformly excellent (particularly in seasons 1 - 3), with two-person writing teams used to develop  many of the episodes. The show capitalized on both the Cold War fears and interests of the time, but also jumped on the James Bond phenomenon, which was an excellent background for satirical humor. But we can also in hindsight see that it is unlikely the show would have shot to such levels of popularity had it not been for the casting of Adams, Feldon, and Platt. These three made the perfect trio, with Adams yucking it up as the daffy secret agent who always, miraculously, came through in spite of his ineptness, Platt as the Chief who had the perpetual headache due to Max's behavior, and the moderating and professional competence of Feldon. Nearly every episode capitalized on the dynamic created by the contrasts within this ensemble.

Given the unique premise and idiosyncratic setting in which Get Smart became popular, it would seem natural to believe that the show would never be enjoyable to watch outside of the political and social context in which it was created. This feeling could be magnified when we consider that the show contains so much political and social commentary as a background for its episodes. It is an odd irony of the series that for some reason, perhaps due to the extent to which the show pushed its unique character, Get Smart remains extremely entertaining today. It's true that this type of humor is not everyone's cup of tea, but for most, its mix of sophmoric, tag-line humor combined with moments of sophisticated insight make it a unique entry into the comedy world, a classic that retains its humor, warmth, and charm.  Some people describe the show as hysterically funny, and indeed, it can be. The humor works so effectively that, even if one has all the lines and scenes memorized, laughs are still evoked. (And Get Smart is one of those shows that defies all convention by becoming even more funny when episodes are repeatedly re-watched.)

Many have been waiting for years for this series to be released on DVD, and as aggravating as the wait was, it was completely worth it. The video and audio transfer from the original film stock is so outstanding that it almost appears as though the series was filmed last year rather than almost half a century ago. The image quality is incredibly crisp and colorful to the point that even those who have watched the show in reruns on television for years will have the unexpected experience of seeing the show in an entirely new light. Add to that the restoration of segments that have been habitually cut out to maximize commercial time, and it becomes a uniquely enjoyable experience to sit down and plow through the entire set once again.

If you have never watched Get Smart, I can tell you that this is one of the truly great comedy shows to have ever been made, and chances are you'll find a lot to enjoy in it. If you are a veteran get Smart watcher, you probably are not even reading this review, because you have already purchased the set the moment it became available. Buy the set, and if a concerned spouse raises a ""magenta alert"" about the $139 price tag, just say ""Sorry about that, Chief!""",1225670400,8,4779,4.7149700598802395

3545118,5,B001E0O8DA,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining.

And while some of the running gags become almost tropes (how often will Max repeat a plan that 99 just suggested), this clever parody of spy thrillers is one of the best time capsules of the 1960s. A lot of the comedy is dependent on Mel Brooks and ""The Graduate's"" Buck Henry, but the delicious writing wouldn't work without the brilliant  comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings, who survives on a mix of bravado and dumb luck. This bumbling spy works at a top-secret government agency called Control, which is responsible for keeping the free world free (very Cold War). Backing him up is his beautiful partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

Together with 99 (whom he marries late in the series), and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. They battle against their archnemesis Siegfried and a bunch of other KAOS agents, with explosive paintings, lovable robots, explosive pianos, KAOS shoe stores, evil gurus, espionage on the Orient Express, the Claw, the Choker, evil hippies, and much more.

In a sense, ""Get Smart"" is the perfect antithesis of the suave, inhumanly competent James Bond -- his catchphrases (""Missed it by that much!"") and goofy confidence somehow get him through the day. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than skill... but somehow, he still succeeds.

The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing, with lots of running gags (Larabee becomes a secondary source of comic ineptitude) and snappy dialogue (""Confiscate that plant!"" ""I can't do that, Chief. I'm not a priest!""). What's really funny is the endless spoofery -- Max is given all sorts of weird gadgets, including the legendary ""shoe-phone,"" and he faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains. And it has dozens and dozens of movie spoofs -- ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""King Kong,"" and even the Bond movie ""Goldfinger.""

The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. Some references are dated, and this definitely debuted before the era of political correctness and racial sensitivity (there's a bizarre episode about American Indians threatening the US government, and the Claw is funny if un-PC).

Don Adams MAKES this series, with his quirky facial expressions, nasal voice and odd body language. His Max overestimates his own skill and believes himself to be a sexy, karate-chopping Bondian treasure, though he survives mostly by luck (""Missed it by that much!""). Barbara Feldon is the least quirky of the cast, serving as the ""straight woman"" for Max, as well as the brains for his adventures. Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering, stressed-out Chief, who always looks slightly frayed, and Bernie Kopell is hysterical as the stiff-backed, volatile Siegfried.

It's been decades since ""Get Smart"" was first aired, but it is still gutsplittingly funny if you can get past some of the awkward racial jokes. You'll roll around on the floor, laughing yourself sick... and... loving it.",1219795200,85,3673,5.047854785478548

The program has lost absolutely none of its appeal; it is just as much fun to watch now as it was when it first hit the airwaves during the mid-60s. As far as I am concerned, Don Adams was born to play the role of Maxwell Smart Agent 86. His personality and mannerisms perfectly fit this timeless character. Barbara Feldon makes a definitiive Agent 99 (whose actual name is never revealed once throughout any of the 138 episodes). Edward Platt was the right choice to play The Chief. Although he continually gets fed up with Maxwell Smart's consistent bumbling, you could see deep down that he actually admired and respected him very much.

GOOD: The shows are in order. There are narrated episodes that explain why the car in the opening scene went from red to blue. Stories about how Don Adams studied his script are simply amazing. There is more behind the scenes stuff here than you can imagine.  All the episodes have the full into and end credits. No shaving. Highest quality too.

BAD: If the price is too high for you, wait five years when the value will be through the roof! Truly this is worth the price. Okay that's not really bad. The only bad I saw was from the original production. Maybe the camera lens had a hair in it,and when you use two cameras to shoot a show, you keep seeing that hair. That's it!

POINTS: As I try to catch every detail now,I see the limitations on reality.  I can see Don's stunt double. I see continuity errors. I even saw a huge spelling error in a scene on a government building sign. Was that a joke that the props department did or did no one check them?

From a technical standpoint, the series has been remastered brilliantly. It looks like it's being shown on TV for the first time (only this time, with turn of the millenium picture quality).
People sometimes forget how popular spy fiction was back in the 1960s. James Bond started it all and was quickly followed by a host of series - Mission Impossible, Man From U.N.C.L.E., etc. Along comes the comic genius of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry who decided to spoof the whole espionage craze. Add in the comedic talents of Don Adams, the beautiful Barbara Feldon, and an excellent supporting cast and the result is a wonderful situation comedy.
For those who grew up in the 1970s, and enjoyed Get Smart in reruns, you'll be in the throws of nostalgia as you once again witness shoe phones, cones of silence, and Smart's gorgeous red convertible ""Tiger"" automobile.

The DVDs are clearly purple-dyed 4.7 GB ""consumer"" versions and not the TimeLife original. The hefty price of nearly US$ 250 did the rest. Better buy the present (2008) version!",1193356800,7,313,4.9245283018867925
3545125,5,B001E0O8DA,"As a dedicated spy nut, I was ecstatic when I heard that Get Smart was being released on DVD at last. Even with the anticipation, the set still managed to exceed my expectations. The box is set up to look like the elevator Max disappears into during the title credits. In addition to sharp, bright and clean episode quality, each season is loaded with extras, including commentary from both Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, numerous documentaries, a touching clip from Don Adams' memorial service and commentary from Barbara Feldon before EACH EPISODE. The set also includes the black and white pilot episode which I had never seen before. In short, this sucker is loaded. Nick at Nite hasn't shown Get Smart for years now, so those of you going through advanced cases of Max and 99 withdrawl can have your Get Smart cravings satisfied forever with this great set. Here's hoping the set will soon be more widely available so Amazon can offer it at its usual rock-bottom price.",1171929600,48,970,4.745562130177515
3545126,5,B001E0O8DA,"I grew up watching ""Get Smart"", and watched an episode marathon on the TV Land network a few years ago, hosted by none other than Mr. Smart himself, Don Adams. Saying I'm a big fan is an understatement--I used to have a replica of the 1970 Opal GT that Max drove in the final season!

So when I first heard the news that the series was finally being released to DVD, I was ecstatic.

All the great catchphrases, all the goofy gadgetry & memorable characters (Max, Agent 99, the Chief, Sigfried, and even Larabee, who amazingly succeeded in being dumber than Max!) are finally here.

But why such a high selling price?? I would love to own this collection, but like most fans, will wait until the price comes down.",1169683200,12,713,4.469230769230769
3545127,5,B001E0O8DA,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining. With the comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt, this hilarious spy spoof is still funny today.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings. The bumbling spy at a top-secret government agency called Control, which is responsible for keeping the free world free. Backing him up is his beautiful partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

Together with 99 (whom he marries late in the series), and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. They battle against their archnemesis Siegfried and a bunch of other KAOS agents, with explosive paintings, lovable robots, explosive pianos, evil hippies, and much more.

""Missed it by that much!"" Maxwell Smart's catchphrases and goofy confidence made him the perfect antidote to the suave James Bond. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than skill... but somehow, he still succeeds.

The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing. What's really funny is the endless spoofery -- Max is given all sorts of weird gadgets, including the legendary ""shoe-phone,"" and he faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains. And it has dozens and dozens of movie spoofs -- ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""King Kong,"" and even the Bond movie ""Goldfinger.""

The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. Some references are dated, and this definitely debuted before the era of political correctness (there's a bizarre episode about American Indians threatening the US government, and the Claw is funny if un-PC).

Don Adams MAKES this series, with his quirky facial expressions, nasal voice and odd body language. His Max overestimates his own skill and believes himself to be a sexy, karate-chopping Bondian treasure, though he survives mostly by luck (""Missed it by that much!"").

Barbara Feldon is the least quirky of the cast, serving as the ""straight woman"" for Max, as well as the brains for his adventures. Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering, stressed-out Chief, who always looks slightly frayed, and Bernie Kopell is hysterical as the stiff-backed, volatile Siegfried.

It should be noted that right now, the entire series is only available directly from Time Life, with a big price tag (I was lucky enough to watch a relative's copy). Wait until Fall 2007, and it will be widely available at a lower price. They're also exquisitely remastered, with all that sixties colour, and they've reinserted little bits that were cut for commercials. It actually improves the flow.

It's been decades since ""Get Smart"" was first aired, but it is still gutsplittingly funny. You'll roll around on the floor, laughing yourself sick... and... loving it.",1169078400,33,3318,5.107011070110701
3545128,5,B001E0O8DA,"we just got the time-life dvds and after a quick watching of two episodes on the first disc, i have to say the shows look great! picture and sound quality are incredible with loads of extras. we're ecstatic to have these dvds. good job to all concerned who helped produce these discs.",1168992000,8,284,4.480769230769231
3545129,5,B001E0O8DA,"I have long been a fan of Get Smart.  It stands head and shoulders above every other 60s sitcom.  I've missed it from the the airwaves for years.  Many episodes stand up to repeated viewings, and I cannot say that about many other programs.

Never has there been a show that spawned so many catchphrases, all of which lose nothing even when repeated constantly over the course of the show.  My favourite:

Smart:  ""Okay, dummy, let's see how tough you are without your gun"" (or similar)

** Smart tries to attack ""dummy"" to no effect **

Smart (putting arm around ""dummy""):  ""Listen, I hope I wasn't out of line about that crack about ""dummy"".

Imagine then my excitement in seeing that the entire series was available on dvd.  My wife got it for me for Christmas and I've been enjoying it every since.  Whatever she paid for it - it's worth it.  (However, be aware that for now at least you can only get this from the Time Life website.)

With 25 magificent disks, it will take weeks to go through the 138 episodes, all of which are uncut, and remastered to reflect colours and detail that I bet weren't even available when originally broadcast.  This is to say nothing about the many featurettes, interviews, bloopers, and other extras that are available on each disk.  It's clear that nearly every surviving actor or professional who was at some point involved with the show was also involved when developing this set, so it's a labour of love by all concerned.

My one small complaint - only a few episodes have comment tracks.

Another regret is that Don Adams did not live long enough to see this produced and therefore could not add his voice to all the others.  Imagine what that'd've been like!

The show is also interesting as an early vehicle for Mel Brooks, Buck Henry and a collection of other talented writers and directors. You can see the results in the combination of witty parody (John Byner channelling LBJ?) and silliness (""Fang, Nimm die Bomb!"") in all episodes.  And check out Carol Burnett as ""Ozark Annie"" (season 3)!

Thus Get Smart is entertaining to both older and younger viewers at different levels.",1168819200,14,2128,4.646112600536193

3545131,5,B001E0O8DA,"The long wait for this series has finally paid off.  I received this box set of DVDs for Christmas. I don't know what the set cost or what it was like to deal with the company where it was purchased.  But putting those attributes aside, I can say that the video and sound are very high quality.  The extra features and commentary are enjoyable. This is a first-class production.  This set turned out to be everything I had hoped for. Everyone will have to decide what price they are willing to pay but that didn't matter to me after about the first 10 minutes of laughter and smiles as I watched the first episode. So to summarize my thoughts on this series, yes, it may be expensive and/or hard to get but those of us who grew up loving the show will ultimately have to become owners of this series...""and loving it!!""",1168300800,6,819,4.368421052631579

Even though it is unavailable in retails stores till later this year, you can order it through the Time Life website where they are selling it exclusivley.  There are bonus features that show in-depth interviews with Barbara Feldon (Agent 99) and Bernie Kopell (Ziegfried) as well as numerous other flash-back spots. Don Adams was (is) a truly gifted comedic actor and it's unfortunate that he did not live to see the upcoming remake of Get Smart Movie (being produced by Warner Bros. with Steve Carrell as Max and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99).  Some of my favorite episodes are the wedding of him and 99.  Seeing characters such as Hymie the Robot and The Admiral made me chuckle.  Watching each episode takes you back to a time when our world was a little more innocent (perhaps naive) but it'll leave you with a smile on your face regardless.  A definite MUST HAVE!
