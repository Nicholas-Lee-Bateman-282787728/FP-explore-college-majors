Having been a pediatric nurse, I would consider showing this movie to older children with type I diabetes who have trouble complying with their self care protocol. It may be a good way to acquaint them with the harsh reality of what could happen to them if they don't stick with their care. I suggest parents pre-view it though before showing it to kids with Type I diabetes. Just so that they can think of ways to discuss it.",1347667200,2,451,4.445783132530121
2755551,1,B000N47PAQ,"For anyone who knows anything about raising a dog, I cannot stress enough how horrible this movie is. It was totally unrealistic, boring, and an extremely inaccurate picture about the life of a guide dog. Having raised several guide dog puppies for the blind, as well as being a certified dog obedience trainer, I was very excited to watch this movie. The first scenes were just delightful. However, as soon as they started training the dog, I lost all respect for the director. He glossed over all the hard work and dedication that is required during the months and months of rigorous training these dogs must go through.

In addition to the gross absurdities pertaining to the process of training a guide dog, the acting was nothing to write home about. I felt no empathy whatsoever for the main character; he was unlovable and did not respect the dog like he should have. Furthermore, the plot was all over the place. There are many scenes that had no connection to the rest of the movie.

I have never seen a movie this bad. Do not waste your time or your money.",1343260800,5,1066,4.575916230366492

2755554,5,B000N47PAQ,"Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog is a fascinating and extremely touching story of guide dog, named Quill, who impacts the life of everyone he touches: from his first ""mom"", to his foster family, to his handler/trainer and finally his ""person"".  You don't even need to read the subtitles to understand and feel what is going on and to be moved by the whole experience.  This seemingly ""ordinary Lab"" becomes the finest guide dog that the Training Center ever ""created"" and his loyalty and dedication to all of his ""people"" is a pleasure and an inspiration to watch.  There are a few scenes that may be difficult for children to watch and understand as Quill is trained  and cared for by his reluctant owner, but for any older children and adults who love dogs/animals and/or are interested in learning about these unbelievable creatures who guide the handicapped, this is truly a ""must see"".

2755558,4,B000N47PAQ,"Ah, the Japanese dog movie.  It is a strange genre, although a prolific one.  Any Japanese DVD shop will have a section devoted to it, and there are sometimes even cat movies as well.  Probably the most familiar to US audiences is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Milo-Otis/dp/B00000JL8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Milo & Otis</a>, which was, shortened, re-edited and narration added for American audiences.

Unlike most US dog movies, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benji/dp/B0002H3S6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benji</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lassie/dp/B0002VEYV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lassie</a>, the Japanese dog movie usually presents their animals as non-anthropomorphic, not performing super-feats or amazing tricks, but just showing loyalty and love and companionship, all the things a dog should do.  They rarely save the day or foil criminals.  They always bring a tear to the eye with their simple affection.

""Quill"" is a quintessential Japanese dog movie.  A floppy little puppy, cute as they come and entirely poster-ready, is trained to be a seeing-eye dog.  A cantankerous blind person, assured that he doesn't need to be dragged around by a dog, is set to be proven wrong.  Bring out the hankies and open the floodgates!

The story was adapted from a popular novel, ""The Life of Quill, the Seeing-Eye Dog"". The film is almost a documentary, showing Quill from his initial training up to his eventual bonding with his human companion to whom he will be both eyes and best friend.  The training is handled in a realistic fashion, without forced drama or silly situations.  While designed to be simple, and to educate children about the life of a seeing-eye dog, under the directorial hand of Yoichi Sai (A shock in and of itself, considering his next film was the brutal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-and-Bones/dp/B000SAGCPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood and Bones</a>.  Apparently he had enough of sweetness and needed to get dirty), ""Quill"" becomes an enjoyable and moving film.

It is absolutely the kind of film that you could watch with little children, and still get something out of it yourself.  Be warned that the film is realistic, and that death is a major theme.  Nothing horrible happens, there is no heart-wrenching accident: this isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Old-Yeller/dp/B00005RRG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Old Yeller</a>, but death is a part of all living creatures, and is something that ""Quill"" addresses.",1213747200,23,2742,6.530386740331492

2755581,5,B000N47PAQ,"Despite what some of these people are saying, I believe this is a wonderful movie. I don't see how the dogs are mistreated in any way? It's not hard to watch, there is not animal abuse going on here, even in fiction. Someone mentioned him being in a cage his whole life, even though the movie shows countless times that he wasn't. If they mean his KENNEL, they must not know much about dog training and dog training facilities. It's an emotional movie, and you learn a bit about how guide dogs are trained and what makes a good guide dog. It's well-acted, and I find the fact that Quill is just simply a dog refreshing. What I mean by that is, in most American dog movies, the dog talks. There is some over-the-top voice actor as the dog, with crappy CGI lip movement and one-liners. Just awful. But here, Quill is simply Quill. He is a dog, and the movie portrays dog emotion very well. You feel for this animal as if he were your own, and you can tell he is upset when his handler passes away.

2755604,1,B000N47PAQ,"If you're looking for a sweet, gentle movie about a guide dog and how he turns his blind owners life around, SKIP THIS ONE. I don't know what the other reviewers are even talking about on here, actually praising this movie. The acting is terrible, especially of the ""blind"" guy, and for some reason he felt like he needed to abuse this poor dog they used in the movie. It's horrible. All he does for half of the movie is yell at this dog, or when he falls, he literally drags the dog down with him. There's one scene where he is ""brushing"" the dog that is torturous to watch. He is literally raking the brush (extremely hard) against the dogs back, you can see the pain in the dogs eyes as he bows his head to take some of the pressure off his body. He apparently does it to show the dog the anger he is feeling by being forced to use a guide dog. He literally takes his anger out on this gentle dog, it's disgusting. Why was that necessary? Why did they even have to do that in the movie? These people are sick! To top it all off, after the dog putting in a hard day of work of taking care of this ingrate, he's dragged back to the guys home to live in a small crate in the yard.
I sincerely hope this is not based on a true story, because that innocent dog lived a life of abuse and pain.",1392422400,3,1290,4.04296875

2755607,1,B000N47PAQ,"I was shocked that the family who got Quill was allowed to keep him outside in the rain and weather.  I thought Guide Dogs were so valuable that the Guide Dogs For The Blind organizations would require, as a condition of receiving one of these exceptionally sensitive and highly trained animals, that the dog be kept indoors with the family.  This video gives the impression that a Guide Dog is merely a commodity, like a tool for a blind human, except it is a living thing.  I expected a more humane treatment of this subject. The man who received Quill should have stuck with finding his way with his stick, as he preferred to do.  I hated him....I don't care what was wrong with him or that he suffered from illnesses that eventually killed him.  He should never have been given a Guide Dog.",1390867200,5,794,4.486111111111111
2755608,1,B000N47PAQ,"The film starts off wonderfully -- little puppy Quill meets many loving, caring people early along his path to becoming a guide dog. All is beatific until... Quill meets the blind man who is to be his final owner. The man is a class-A jerk, a negligent dog owner and, in my opinion, is completely undeserving of a guide dog. As a bonus, he's unpleasant to his two kids, too. We turned the video off after the scene where the owner leaves Quill outside without adequate shelter in a pounding rainstorm and, when his son tries to offer Quill shelter with an umbrella, the father yells at his son to ""mind his own business and come inside."" (After which Quill -- sensibly -- runs away.)

I suspect the story reaches a touching dog-redeems-nasty-man conclusion, but getting there was just not worth the yuck.",1390176000,6,804,4.6223776223776225

Quill went through this, along with what had to be several traumatic changes in ownership over his lifetime. I was also surprised to learn that commands for these dogs are given in English - easier for the dog to understand than Japanese. Was also impressed with how Quill would work to dissuade his handler, a rather stubborn person, from proceeding into danger. Unfortunately, at first Quill's blind owner didn't treat the dog well, and Quill ran away. Worse yet, after being returned the owner died from complications of his diabetes and Quill wasted some seven years of his life at the training center - for unknown reasons he was not reassigned to a new person. Eventually Quill was returned to the family that cared for him during his first year - he remembered them, along with his toys, etc. But Quill didn't have long to live himself - a sad ending.",1376092800,,983,4.687861271676301

It is about a pup who goes into guide dog training but it's really more about the love between the dog and the people he meets and their love of him than about him being a guide dog. There are some sad parts but the movie is very gentle.  I would have given it five stars but for it being confusing toward the end, where even though Quill's blind master dies he is kept at the Guide Dog Training Academy for many years where all he does is help with occasional guide dog demonstrations, and then returned to the loving couple who raised him when he grows old.  I don't understand why if they weren't going to use him for a guide dog anymore they didn't just let him return to them sooner.  That needed to be explained. It is, however, a very realistic and touching film, full of love, and one of the most special dog stories I've ever seen brought to the screen.",1374969600,2,1010,4.294736842105263

Like Marley and Me, it shows the life of this cute Labrador in it's entirety, from puppyhood to the inevitable last days. It's not overly gushy, nor dramatic, which is what makes the dialogue more sincere and believeable. It is also interesting in that it opened my eyes about cross-communication between species/creatures (humans and dogs), and among humans, i.e. how a blind person communicates with a deaf person and vice versa. I would recommend it for any one, especially dog lovers, as well as lovers of foreign film.",1369094400,3,659,4.681034482758621
2755653,3,B000N47PAQ,"You would think the storyline had the makings of a great movie, but something was lost in translation here. For one thing, I don't think the Japanese culture has the same devoted dog-crazy tradition that America does. But more importantly, there was no character development here and this caused the movie to fall flat for me. The best part was the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie where you see the adorable Quill as a puppy and his first set of loving, childless owners who treat him like a pampered toddler. But after that, Quill is sent to a training school for seeing eye dogs and is later placed with a gruff blind Japanese man.

The problem here is that you develop no empathy or compassion for the blind owner or his family. There simply is no character development that offers details, insight or understanding into how this man came to be blind or the challenges he faces. He barks instructions to the dog (no pun intended) and insists on walking in the middle of a busy highway with the dog, creating a massive traffic backup (but no honking horns; those Japanese are so polite) leaving you as the viewer to wonder why.

Some of the attempts at humor fell flat, mainly because of the director's lack of film-making skill. There's no lead up to it and it was only later that I realized oh, that was supposed to be funny.

So overall, I was disappointed in this movie. Hollywood is so often formulaic, obvious and over the top, with the same old, tired faces (aka ""stars"") but this movie was just the opposite: it failed to engage me. While I loved the dog, the people in its life did not inspire any strong emotion except for a general disliking for the blind owner, which I'm sure was not the intended effect the director was looking for.",1367712000,5,1752,4.4858934169279

2755655,4,B000N47PAQ,"This was a good movie, save for the sad ending which we did not watch through completion. Would have been nice to have avoided that kind of ending..",1365465600,,148,4.321428571428571
2755656,5,B000N47PAQ,"I love dogs and having three just makes this movie so much more special.  Quill like all dogs gives love to all he comes in contact with, even if the love isn't always immediately returned.  He went to several homes during his all too brief life and was a patient, loving and faithful guide dog (something many humans are not.). It was very interesting to actually hear in the movie that commands to guide dogs are given in English as they are less confusing/complicated to the dog.  I was impressed by the love, devotion and patience given to Quill by his foster family and trainers.  This movie is highly recommended to all, not just dog lovers.",1364515200,,647,4.551724137931035
2755657,4,B000N47PAQ,"This movie had a great storyline but the ending was a little harsh, especially for younger viewers. Despite the ending I felt as though it was an interesting movie and would recommend it to others.",1361491200,,197,4.6571428571428575
2755658,4,B000N47PAQ,"This is a darling movie about the life of one dog-guide born, trained and working in Japan. It is in Japanese with English sub-titles. I would have liked to have had this movie in English. That would have been perfect.

The music and plot are exceptionally well done.",1357689600,,267,4.5625
2755659,5,B000N47PAQ,"As a UK puppy walker I was intrigued as to how another country did it.  However, for anyone who loves dogs this in a must-see film.  Heart-warming and don't think I have cried so much in a long time.  Very moving.",1355184000,,213,4.146341463414634

8174682,2,B000N47PAQ,It had promise. But I was more interested in how they train guide dogs and develop them and that wasn't really covered as much as I was hoping for and the ignorance of the owner was very disappointing.,1478649600,,201,4.315789473684211

8174684,5,B000N47PAQ,"If you enjoyed and cried through ""Hachi"" you will enjoy and certainly cry seeing ""Quill"" We have an Akita and a Lab and we watched both with our buddies and loved them. Our Akita loves when we get dog movies. He has been know to bark back at the animals on TV at times. This is a wonderful story of the little dog who couldn't and what happened to him after ""flunking"" out of school. This puppy has a rich life (no spoilers here) that was very entertaining. You will cry, but the journey is well worth it.",1468627200,,505,4.163265306122449
8174685,5,B000N47PAQ,Held off writing this review. This film is one of those sad stories that breaks your heart. Very touch and perfectly executed. Didn't want to review this film for fear of it getting me right in the tear ducts again.,1462492800,,215,4.4
