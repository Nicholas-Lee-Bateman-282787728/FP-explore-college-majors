3896001,3,B002BWD7DM,Videos are of excellent image quality but not the best of the Shaw brothers flicks in the least bit. Convoluted plots and avg. fight scenes. For true collectors only.,1303948800,14,166,4.758620689655173
3896002,5,B002BWD7DM,"SHAW BROTHERS COLLECTION II
This four-disc set contains BROTHERS FIVE (1970), HOLY FLAME OF THE MARTIAL WORLD, JOURNEY OF THE DOOMED (1985), and BRAVE ARCHER AND HIS MATE. I already have Brothers Five which has Cheng Pei Pei(She is my favorite Shaw Brothers lady)it was already released. So was Journey of the Doomed. You can pre order the other two movies. I know I am ordering the Brave Archer and His Mate which they say is the Fourth Brave Archer. I have seen the first three and own them and love them. Anyway I hope this helps you on what movies are in the collection.
