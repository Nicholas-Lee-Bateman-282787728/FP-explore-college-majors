8326757,4,B001NF2ASQ,"While it's true a lot of the video is faded, is that a surprise? Consider the source...the age. I found these DVDs extremely interesting; the organization and narration was first rate. I'm glad to see this long, in-depth story of Barbarossa at all; don't think it's reasonable to expect it to be very crisp and clear. In the unlikely event that it's possible to renew such material, the cost would be stupendous.",1252627200,13,412,4.736111111111111
8326758,1,B001NF2ASQ,The quality of this footage is hideously poor.  It is something that Amazon should not be selling for $50.00!!,1243555200,11,110,4.7894736842105265
8326759,2,B001NF2ASQ,"The DVD looked O.K. so I ordered it. First shock came when my Pioneer DVD player wouldn't read it. Fortunately the Panasonic DVD recorder did. Second shock when I inspected the disc and found they were DVD-Rs. The contents of the DVD were O.K. but video quality was quite poor, with many scenes having a bad washed out look. For die hard WW2 nuts only. i think Amazon should have at least stated the discs were recordables. The book is O.K. but the set not worth US$50 I.M.O.",1243123200,16,475,4.409090909090909
