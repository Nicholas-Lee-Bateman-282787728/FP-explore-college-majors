8734652,4,B015UDEMDW,"Lovely movie, with beautiful images of Singapore in the 70's. Unfortunately, the DVD has no captions or subtitles. This makes it very difficult for me, hard hearing and Dutch as native language, to understand all dialogs.",1521676800,,221,5.166666666666667

8734655,4,B015UDEMDW,"A well made film, offering an insight Singapore during the early seventies. Ben Gazzara plays his role well, but proffers an annoying semi-permanent smile throughout. Locations and scenery is excellent, along with a strong story line, and a featured presence of the, Director Peter Bogdanovich.",1465948800,,294,5.555555555555555
8734656,4,B015UDEMDW,"An introspective look at an American hustler in 1970's Singapore, Saint Jack sidesteps all the usual clichs of this kind of story. Unfortunately, it sidesteps some of the drama too. Neither thriller nor thrilling in any conventional sense, it's really a meditation on disillusionment. A boulevard of broken pimp dreams.  You won't find a better Ben Gazzara performance than the one here; it's a great companion piece to his work in The Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But how much you enjoy it depends on your tolerance for the Euro-cinema approach to storytelling that Bogdanovich employs . Some viewers will find that nothing happens; other viewers might say its narrative emptiness is the point. More art house than whorehouse. Recommended.",1461283200,,740,5.166666666666667

many wonderful memories when my military service gave me the opportunity to visit the exotic beautiful Singapore. Ben Gazzara  was great in
this film, Saint Jack will all way's be one favorite movie's to take me back in time to the 70's when I was young free and crazy and having a none
stop party in the Fareast.",1456185600,2,457,4.440476190476191
