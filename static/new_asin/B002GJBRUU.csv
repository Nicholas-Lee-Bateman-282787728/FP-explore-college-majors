8369792,5,B002GJBRUU,"The only thing I wish this DVD had was subtitles.  I don't know French, but I do know comedy and this is classic.  This is the typical 80's / 90's parody of films type of humor and I get it even though I don't understand what they are saying.  It is very visual and quite comical.

Not much more to say than that I laugh a lot while watching this film.",1343779200,,352,3.915492957746479
