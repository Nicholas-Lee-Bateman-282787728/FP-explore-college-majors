2890976,5,B000SUHOF6,"Boris Karloff is an oriental sleuth. His normal menacing demeanor is absent in these clever mysteries to be replaced by the normal humility of an oriental person.  The stories are convoluted, but Mr. Wong figures out all the twists and turns by the end of the film. Families can watch these films without worring about adult situations, graphic violence, or bad language.",1395705600,6,371,4.983870967741935
