6517532,5,B00M0GM2NA,This is the scariest end times themed horror film I have ever seen. I actually like it more than the omen remake and the seventh sign. It combines movies like left behind and the omen and creates its own story that is well maybe not entirely accurate still scary as heck. Fans of the omen and left behind should absolutely check this out.,1422316800,3,338,4.380952380952381
6517533,2,B00M0GM2NA,"It was an entertaining film and It'll do if all you're looking for is a scary movie with some suspense. But if you're looking for a scary movie about the Rapture with Biblical accuracy, this is not your film. Scripture is clear the Rapture will occur in the blink on an eye and believers will be taken body and soul to heaven to be spared the seven years of Tribulation that will come, nobody knows exactly when the SEVEN years of a Tribulation will begin. Many Biblical Scholars agree it will begin when the Anti-Christ signs a peace agreement with Israel. Of course he will be a deceiver and the peace treaty will be anything but.
It's a shame all these movies about the Rapture miss so many things and important details. For this movie to call what was happening after their version of the Rapture the end of the world is silly, nowhere in scripture does it say the world will end. If they are doing a film about the Rapture and everything to do with that subject they should study the book of Revelations, see what happens after Christ's Second return to earth? His first return to Earth was during the Rapture, second will be at the end of the seven years of Tribulation in a white horse to battle Satan, the anti-Christ and the false prophet, etc. They should read the entire book of Revelations to see God does not destroy the Earth. It would have been a very good and scary movie if they would've done a bit more research, Maybe speak to some top Biblical authors to verify information. That way they can have a movie that is scary, accurate, but not ridiculous like some other Rapture films.",1422316800,2,1600,4.464163822525597
6517534,2,B00M0GM2NA,"If your worried about going to heaven or hell and haven't saved yourself by committing to god then this film is for you. The movie is about a couple, Dan and Skylar, who are about to get married as the wedding is under way, until people begin to drop and planes begin falling from the skies. Theres lightning, hail, fires, and hovering entities that loom in the shadows that all adds up to the biblical ties of the rapture. From the producer who brought Donnie Darko comes Casey La Scalas second outing as a director to bring a film about the end of the world and how faith may be your only way out.

Under the radar and had never been advertised in theaters The Remaining is a change of sorts that brings together the elements of the supernatural with ties to the bible. When the movie starts off your not sure if its made as a found-footage piece or a straight live action horror film. As the film progresses it becomes clear that it is the lather of the two and incorporates the camera work as an add-on. It didn't take away from the movie, but you could tell that the makers seemed like they weren't too sure of what technique they wanted to use. Gladly they did a little bit of both; although I think it wouldve worked either way as a found footage or a live-action account.

The characters for the most part were mediocre to just okay considering the material they were working with. Its hard to explain why Im mixed on the film because on the one hand it works as a horror thriller where people are scrambling to safety from the events of the rapture that includes Locusts that lurk outside. On the other hand, when your dealing with biblical events and having to inject religion to the movie, it comes across as preachy as God is referenced a lot. Because of the preachiness and overuse of the bible the movie fails to be that horror thriller that it was trying to be.

While watching the movie I quickly recalled the 70s mini-series called A Thief In The Night where the rapture occurs and those left behind had to take in the mark of the beast to continue living their daily lives or otherwise be sentenced to death and be with god. Scalas attempt here is like a film adaption of that 70s series except adding a modern day touch where it doesnt go into the details. One of the things that bothered me was just as people began to drop dead and planes began falling and cars were crashing into each other was that Skylar immediately came to the conclusion that the rapture was happening. Rather then taking its time to let the events unfold and slowly come to the conclusion, its given away from the get-go and becomes silly.

Because the rapture signals the end of society you already know everyone is going to die at some point. This is where the film doesnt work to satisfy audiences who were expecting a thriller. The middle portion of the film lags and has exposition between characters of the events going on while questioning their faiths and why they were left behind. With moments of tension and a beginning that looks promising the film slowly delves into religion and an ending that can be seen long before the film end.

Another film comes out in October called Left Behind that has a familiar plot where millions of people disappear and those who are left behind have to fight to survive the aftermath. If The Remaining is any indication, Nicholas Cages next film won't fall under the same tropes as this film did.",1422230400,2,3435,4.463375796178344
6517535,5,B00M0GM2NA,"This movie was FANTASTIC!!  It deals with the ""rapture,"" but not in a cheesy ""Left Behind"" way; this movie is genuinely scary in an ""Exorcist"" way.  It's a good looking, well put together movie with amazing cinematography, acting, VFX, production design, and sound design.",1422230400,12,272,5.159090909090909

6517537,2,B00M0GM2NA,"My biggest problem with this movie was the relation between the Rapture and people dying. From what I've learned from study and Church the people who are Raptured are not going to die like they are portrayed in the film. Other films portray those who are 'taken' from factual references.
It's a book that was made in to a movie, I get it. This huge change is a misinterpretation. It's not very accurate. In less than 6 hours things have escalated past the timeline that could have happened should the Rapture happen. Good thing I didn't lose any money when I saw it.",1421452800,,566,4.504854368932039
6517538,4,B00M0GM2NA,"It definitely captured the horror of the rapture and aftermath. And the rapture here was different then Left Behind, only the souls are taken. That's good material for a horror film.
 As a horror movie, it was well done, not cheasy at all, the effects were awesome, the acting was good and it was very frightening and intense. And it wasn't gory, which i liked. I was impressed. Now, they did stretch the truth on one major Revelations biblical fact, which is why i give this movie only four stars,  the demons won't be given power to kill people in the real End Times. Only torture.  I didn't like that but i figured they had fun with it, it being a horror film. Its different then Left Behind. Left behind tried to be really realistic. The remaining was fast moving, entertaining but scary. It definitely left the message that the real Christians escaped the true horror.  It did leave the message that if you have faith, you'll still die but have the chance of eternal life. But i felt better about this movie after reading the book however,  the book provided a bit more closure.  Comparing it to Left Behind,  i like Left Behind more, but this is worth having.  Just remember its a horror film so not everything they depicted is strictly correct.",1421193600,54,1251,4.553571428571429
6517559,2,B00M0GM2NA,"These Harvard type elitist characters were hard enough to deal with, but the fact that basically none of them took the possibility of gods wrath seriously was far from believable... not to mention the fact that the name of Jesus wasn't used once in the entire film was just beyond belief.

6517597,3,B00M0GM2NA,"First off, if you know anything about the Bible, there is no such thing as a Rapture, or it would be mentioned in it. Neither the Talmud or Koran mentions it either. It's akin to how Catholic priests and Nuns practice Celibacy, though there is no mention of it in the Bible. Only certain religions believe in certain things. Main reason so many people don't go to churches. Despite that, the film is quite boring. It isn't a horror film. I'd say it's more of a film to try and turn people toward God than away from him. The special effects are pretty good and wished there was more of it in the film.
Overall, can't recommend it.",1502841600,,629,4.338983050847458

It is the realization this is a bigoted hateful movie that portrays the idea that all non-whites and non-Christians will die horrifically and the remaining Christians only have to accept their Christian faith because God loves them, but hates Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and just about anyone that doesn't believe in Christ and the New Testament....oh...and they have to be white.

The entire main cast is white and the exceptions are merely heathens to be destroyed.

Bigoted hateful religious movies that wish to convey that a loving God tat will save the believers and condemn everyone else to horrible suffering are destructive nonsense.  The hypocrisy of this garbage is stated by one of the survivors soon to get ripped apart by demons, ""God loves us all"".

The message is all white anglo saxon protestants and catholics will be saved if they just believe.  It is like the self absorbed vampire movies that for years taught us that the cross protected us from vampires.

It fails as a Faith film.
It fails as a apocalyptic story.
It fails as a left behind story.
It fails as good story telling.
It's a jumbled up mess.

In the ""Making OF"" the writer director says, paraphrased, ""I wrote the story, threw that away, rewrote the story, then I looked in the book of Revelation for the first time ever of looking in the Bible and there was weird stuff in there. I thought I would some how or other gloom that stuff on my story."" This writer should have gone with whatever his story was before trying to make it a faith film.

I can't really tell that anyone associated with the making of this movie had ever read any part of the Bible. I think they put the work rapture in the movie just so they could sucker people into buying this pile.

The big reveal at the end, if they were trying to portray the part of revelation that I think they might have been trying too, they got it 180 degrees backwards.

The only thing that I can say good about this movie is that there were a couple of scary surprises. I admit I jumped. Also I would give it good editing thumbs up. Sadly this is not enough to give it more than 1 star.",1455926400,7,1176,4.122270742358078
6518069,4,B00M0GM2NA,"Ok. Here is the deal. I want to give THE REMAINING 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I will give it 4. Now, here's why. First of all...this movie is a MUST see as I think it puts the horror of being left behind right in front of your face and driving home that just because you are a good person and/or simply go to church, you are NOT going to heaven. This is something that people need to know, but what the audience also needs to hear is that you must make a decision with what you are going to do with God's Son by either asking Jesus in your heart or not. THIS is where the movie dropped the ball. As a Christian, I knew what they were hinting at, but if you are NOT a Christian you will come away from this movie only thinking you need to simply believe in God. Friends, I am here to tell you that simply believing in God is NOT enough. James2:19 says, ""...you believe in God, good for you! Even the demons believe that, but yet they tremble."" At one point I thought THE REMAINING was going to say what the viewer needs to do so they don't ever have to endure the tribulation, but it simply missed the mark and said in essence, ""You have to have faith.""

I am telling you now, there is more. You need to first, admit that you are a sinner and that Jesus died for your sins on the cross and that three days later God raised His Son from the dead to give us all eternal life. John 3:16 simply states, ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.""

I just wish this movie made clear that the reason these people were left behind was because they never asked Jesus in their heart. The pastor in the movie did say ""The believers were taken"", but yet it didn't state clearly the reason they were believer wasn't because they had faith in God, but they had faith in God's Son Jesus.

That being said, please show this movie to your friends and then use it as a tool to talk about finding faith in Jesus. This movie would be 5 stars for me if it made that clear.",1455494400,,2041,4.084788029925187

The story and the film follows in the tradition of needing to scare people to believe in Jesus -- now it's the Rapture not the devil & hell.  at one point the character Skylar asks where in the Bible is the Rapture?  Good question.  It's not in Revelations, but supposedly in 1 Thessalonians 4:13 - 18 and 1 Corinthians 15:42 -57 though really it's not there either unless you force the imperishable on the perishable.  For 2,000 some years now we are told Jesus will be back any second now.  That's been a great way to fill churches and church coffers.  Apparently, institutionalized Christianity lacks faith in the message of love, charity, and treating others well so it resorts to fear, violence, and death.

If you like end-of-the-world movies that stress the importance of being a good person and believing, watch ""This is The End.""  At least it's very funny, poignant, and at times scary.

6518120,3,B00M0GM2NA,"The ReAs a quasi-religious end of the world horror film I would not rate this one too bad. It is hardly original as things like The Seventh Sign deal with much the same type of issues and imagery. More recently This Is The End pokes fun at this genre, but that one is hardly effective as either a comedy or as horror.

The Remaining deals with a group of young adults attending a wedding when the Rapture happens.

I guess those living in a state of grace are taken up (for the most part little kids and old people are Saved; rich, well to do couples are also fine, as long as they have been married for a long time,) but those that remain on Earth are a good looking, well to do group of friends who look like models and according to extensive video recordings have lived a fantasy, glossy, fashion magazine life.

They are not taken because:

a) They decided not to marry in a church (first commandment.)

b) Some are cheats, although the extent of the cheating is not made explicit, it could have been a simple kiss for all we know (seventh commandment.)

c) One is in love with another's girlfriend (tenth commandment.)

d) ...and also probably the fourth commandment, as they apparently don't really go to church.

But mostly it's because they have either lost their faith or never had it (that certainly is the case of the pastor who shows up later): When they see demons they think the demons are aliens (apparently there is a requirement to have faith in demons in some Christian groups.)

The film is effective in its destruction scenes once they get going (it'll take awhile so it does take some patience sitting thru scene after scene of Christian, 90210 type, bland leads), and the religious message is not too overbearing, though I can easily see some still being turned off by it. The film certainly is no more religious than something like Demon Knight or many other films that deal with demons, but it certainly is less ludicrous than that one and is for the most part seems earnest in its treatment of the subject.

The film's main problem (other than the mostly lame characters and their long initial presentation) is that it doesn't quite know what to do once the Rapture thing settles down. What happens later is that apparently people still have a chance to accept God into their hearts, and if they do they are killed by demons (and taken to Heaven?) and if they deny God then they are also killed by demons (and taken to Hell?) which is somewhat in contradiction of the after-the-Rapture rules as they were presented.

This happens within a day or two of the rapture, so we get to see very little of after-the-Rapture communities and their day to day life, or even what is eventually supposed to happen, which I guess is Judgment Day(?) We are told things will get much worse, but we don't really get to see it.

Actually things calm down a bit.

I am not really versed in Rapture details, but I suspect that even if it written down somewhere different congregations and different people will tend to interpret them in different ways, so it doesn't really matter.

All in all, not bad, probably much better than what those Kirk Cameron Christian crapfests are supposed to be. It's not great either, but it is a fairly suspenseful time killer, you just need to be patient for it.maining (2014)",1446681600,,3315,4.558922558922559

6518160,3,B00M0GM2NA,"You know the Remaining had the potential to be extremely good but it falls short due to some really lackluster writing in the second half.  In the very beginning you'll probably hate this part too- it's a generic wedding taking place with young adults jumping around and having fun.  Really awful writing there that accomplishes very little.  It doesn't even do a good enough job making the characters memorable.  But if you wait 10 minutes you'll be rewarded with a VERY drastic change.  All of a sudden, when one of the characters is in an elevator, one woman suddenly falls to the ground under suspicious conditions after what everyone initially thinks is either an earthquake or an alien invasion (giving the film a War of the Worlds vibe for a little while which is alright by me, I LOVE that movie!)

Once the focus shifts back to the wedding room, we see certain people lying on the ground dead while others are standing around confused and worried.  I'm thinking ""Wow, what a change of story!""  Turns out a rapture is taking place, and the ones who believe in God are killed and taken to heaven immediately while the ones who are still alive are non-believers and shall remain on earth.  Yeah this is one of those controversial storylines, but hey I thought it was pretty good.  As the young adults leave the wedding and head outside they see explosions in the distance approaching, and gigantic balls of hail raining down from the sky.  This pumps up the adrenaline as they take off running.

All good things must come to an end however, and unfortunately for the Remaining the good times are over quickly because as soon as the characters enter a sanctuary and eventually a hospital when one of their female friends is attacked and swung around by tentacle demons lurking from the sky, this is when the storyline gets a lot worse.  Now the mood changes a lot.  It's no longer suspenseful.  Relationship struggles develop between the two guys and one girl (bot guys love the same girl) which gives the story a typical teenage drama vibe, and this particular aspect of the story comes back again and again until pretty close to the conclusion and it's completely unnecessary.  I mean come on- the world is ending.  God is dividing the good people from the bad.  There's Beetlejuice-looking demons roaming around outside also contributing to sort the believers from the non-believers and... relationship troubles?  Like that matters at all given the chaos all around?  D'oh!

Besides that, there are a couple really freaky moments such as the one girl who flips up in the air awkwardly when a giant demonic tentacle slams her around (not sure if she was a believe or not though- the story is sort of contradictory at times perhaps), and later when the one guy becomes closer to God to try and save himself... he's sucked through a door and it's really creepy the way it happens (also the dents that suddenly appear in the door is quite uncomfortable to see because you know demons are on the other side).

Otherwise the ending is really silly (but to be fair there's no logical way to end such a storyline of mega proportions).  The young adults spend most of their time talking about the most trivial of things and it really takes the excitement and fear out of the storyline in a big way.  Also, just because everyone's constantly indoors shouldn't automatically assure safety.  Only in Hollywood I suppose.  An okay storyline but it needed more to make it truly awesome.

6518240,4,B00M0GM2NA,"First things first: Give this movie a chance, it is surprisingly entertaining and at moments, truly unnerving, though, ironically enough, suspension of disbelief (or belief, as the case may be) is required for full immersion and enjoyment.  Did this movie scare me?  No, however, it was interesting, entertaining and enjoyable.
 I have long been a fan of horror movies, particularly supernatural horror ala Poltergeist (the original), Prince of Darkness, Ringu, Nightmare on Elm Street (again, the original), The Exorcist, The Shining, Pet Cemetery...you get the gist.  I happened upon this amidst one of my many 3am 'intermissions' of what would otherwise be a good night's sleep, the t.v. had been left on and some 'found footage' film was on.  I, like many others, have grown weary of the 'found footage' genre, but, hey, it was 3 am and I couldn't get back to sleep so, why not?  Within the first 15 minutes or so of the film, just as I was beginning to think to myself, 'staring at bland beige walls might actually be preferable to watching this crap', things got interesting and...surprising.
Suddenly I was wide awake, sleep long forgotten, caught up in our characters' hellish descent into a literal rendering of a little slice of the Book of Revelations.  I found myself repeatedly noticing and considering little details given to us through quick tidbit conversation: the bride had specifically chosen, against her parents wishes, not to be married in a church despite the fact she had made Christianity a prerequisite to marrying this man, a lady named in one of the scandals to come out later on in the movie was also one of the ones taken/rescued in the rapture, and other things such as the rapid fire trumpet blasts/apocalyptic events happening far more rapidly than we learned in Sunday school.  There were quite a few things like this that made me re-evaluate the 'laws' and world building this movie was presenting to us...they were taking a very particular slant on Revelations, deviating here and there from the norm, taking our own preconceptions from other horror movies, books, the Bible, etc., turning them back on us twisted around into unexpected form and it was interesting to contemplate.
This movie did an admirable job of making our contemporary lives look superficial, decadent, and upon closer inspection, our cherished faiths as simulated and fraudulent as our dearest closest friendships...particularly when held up against the harsh, unimaginable cut and dry, black and white reality of The Bible as portrayed in this film.
The film asks these questions several times in different ways: What if what we deem being 'a good person' isn't truly a good person according to spiritual law?  What if the Bible, any of it, is true?  What if it all isn't exactly as we've convinced ourselves it is (our perception of our lives, friendships, reality, and the standards we'll be held to if the Bible, God, demons, etc., are factual and real) or will be (to live through the actual apocalypse)?
Now, this film has its caveats, quite a few and it does seem to lose focus for a bit there, but it pulls it back on track for the finale...still, the last half is not as impactful, for me, as the first thirty to forty-five minutes, except for the very last and final moments of the film, which are incredibly impactful if you've been paying attention.
Overall, this is a good film.  It is not overly preachy and presents some intriguing food for thought for its contemporary audience; believers and non-believers, religious, lukewarm agnostic, and atheist, alike.  Most found footage films of late do not deviate from the 'shaky hand cam' crap that physically sickens some of their viewers...this one does.  There were many large sections of the movie in which I actually forgot this is supposed to be a 'found footage' film (usually I'm all too aware) and upon recollection of memory, cannot remember it being patently hand cam for the bulk of the movie.  I wish, in retrospect, that they would have ran with the momentum of the first half, keeping the conversation and rapid fire events of Revelations going as these modern, frivolous young adults were plunged headlong into the literal hell on earth foretold in a book most of them had reduced to myth, or a superficial 'belief', or even flippantly dismissed entirely at some point in their lives, for one reason or another.
Whatever problems there were with the movie, it has remained with me and I have thought about it quite often, which is saying something given the schlock I routinely watch and forget nowadays, usually before the credits are done rolling.  I plan on purchasing it after posting this review, as this is one worth revisiting and it doesn't seem SEDG is going to be showing it again anytime soon.
Now that I've prattled on forever, let me just say, again, what I did in the beginning: This is a good movie, give it a chance, turn down the volume on your inner logician and enjoy the film for what it is...a unique take on Revelations and what our oh so savvy youth would do if thrown into the middle of a literal, albeit aberrant, version of it.",1433203200,,5137,4.834851936218679

6518298,3,B00M0GM2NA,"Rapture inspired horror film is made more interesting than your normal Christian fare by introducing the possibility of genuine doubt into the proceedings.  Where in most Christian movies it's always clear that faith in God is ultimately rewarded in The Remaining whether or not that's the case actually remains a matter of faith, even as the end credits roll.

The Remaining opens with a seemingly perfect wedding but during the reception the rapture occurs.  The bride's parents and at least one of her friends drop dead on the spot but the bride and groom and most of their closest friends are left behind.  While the rapture is frequently depicted as the bodies of the faithful rising to heaven, sometimes leaving their clothes behind in The Remaining those dead bodies stay behind like victims suddenly overcome by plague, so even after the rapture has occurred believing that the souls of the faithful have ascended to heaven still requires faith.

What follows in The Remaining is a sometimes scary horror film as the faithful are attacked by winged monsters and other things that are more often than not implied because of the limited effects budget.  But a pattern eventually emerges of people who declare their faith suffering excruciatingly painful deaths--so are these people being rewarded by God with their souls going to heaven or, as the most doggedly rational character in the film believes, are people being killed by monsters that are drawn to faith?

The Remaining isn't nearly as creepy or ambitious as the 1991 Mimi Rogers showcase The Rapture, which is one of the only American films I've ever seen that dealt with religious faith in an honest and intelligent manner.  The Remaining, in contrast, is more of a so-so end of the world horror film, not as scary and dark as The Mist or Cloverfield or as weird and offbeat as Vanishing on 7th Street but there are some scary moments and the film allows the viewer to ask the question of whether a good god would actually do the things outlined in revelations because from the POV of someone on the ground it can just look like you're trapped in a horror movie.",1431216000,,2129,4.813698630136987

It was worse than Samuel L Jackson in Deep Blue Sea getting eaten by a shark while standing in the middle of a room (but at least LL Cool J survived the movie).

Anyway, pretty much everything about this movie was cliche.  Random religious plugs and bible-quoting throughout the movie.  Lots of holes in the story.  There was a diner scene where everyone fell over at once on the trailer that never actually appears in the movie.

Seriously the audience understands that this movie is about the rapture.  Got it.  The story could have been told in a more visually astonishing, and thought-provoking manner rather than actually quoting the bible and pushing stereotypes.

6518607,4,B00M0GM2NA,First let me tell you that I'm no writer. We watched this movie The Remaining on movie night. This was on the edge of your seat action horror movie. This is what I always thought angels and demons may look like if they are sent down here to clean up the evil mess that man has made. It's a good movie but the ending left much up in the air. Maybe that means there could be a sequel around the corner. That would be nice to tie up loose ends.,1426550400,,441,3.911111111111111
6518608,4,B00M0GM2NA,"I was watching another movie and saw a preview for ""The Remaining"" and became very interested in seeing this.  The premise behind a movie based on the rapture is very intriguing and I definitely wanted to see this movie's take on the subject.  I was raised in church and I can remember being a kid (back in the 80s) and seeing a movie at church about the rapture and it really scared me.  I don't know the name of it but all I remember was people going to the guillotine due to their refusal to take the mark of the beast.  If this rings a bell with anyone...please send me a comment about it.  I never saw the ""Left Behind"" movies but I might check them out too.  The thing that attracted me to this particular film is that it appeared to have pretty good production value (slightly better than your typical Sci-Fi channel stuff) and the acting looked genuine.

After having seen the film, I can say that it indeed has some pretty decent acting and the effects are good.  There are some scary moments in it as well and I think the thing that got me the most was the sound of the trumpet blast as the seals are broken.  That was the creepiest and scariest sound ever.  I thought that was an interesting choice because we typically think of a horn blowing and instead we get this sound that just screams impending doom is coming.  The story follows a group of friends (a wedding party) as they try to escape and understand what is happening around them.  I found myself wondering what I would do if I were in that situation and I think the movie did a good job of communicating to me a sense of hopelessness that I would feel if I were going through the same thing.  The movie does interpret the events of the rapture differently as it was explained to me but we probably all were told something unique to our own beliefs and upbringing.  The one thing it does get right is the fact that I certainly wouldn't want to be here in that situation.  I had to break out my Bible and start reading all things second coming based to see if what they put in the movie was factual and I can tell you that Revelations is no easy read.  My uncle was a preacher and before he passed away...I use to call him up all the time with questions like these.

The film was fun to watch.  It was scary at times and I found myself absorb by what was going on.  I did not find the movie distracting in the sense that it was cheesy due to effects, film score, or acting.  The movie succeeded in getting me thinking about the subject and pondering about it afterwards.  It does take some of the rapture elements as I understood them and spin them a little bit but the underlying message was clear...you don't want to be left behind.  Take it as fiction or let this message of the movie inspire you...either way I think you can find some value in it.  I enjoyed it and I look forward to popping it in again with some friends and getting their take on it too.  I give it four stars due to some afterthought disagreements in the movie's approach to certain elements of this event but I also give it four stars because it was enjoyable to watch and I appreciate any movie that gives me an afterthought!  I recommend this one.",1426464000,75,3194,4.26578073089701

6518725,1,B00M0GM2NA,"I'm a huge rapture fan and although I can appreciate a movie that goes more in depth about what will happen after the rapture, a huge problem I have with this movie is that it is plagued with falsehoods and with things that are completely untrue according to scripture.  For example, in the movie it shows that when people are raptured they simply fall down dead, that their bodies are left behind while their souls are taken. That is completely false and is not according to scripture.  The scripture specifically states, (1 Corinthians 15:51) ""we shall all be changed"", meaning our bodies will be changed from mortal into immortal instantly when the rapture occurs.  So the idea that the raptured people will all fall down dead is a lie.  Another lie is that the locust army from the pit will be attacking all remaining people who made a choice to accept God while leaving everyone else alone and that the primary goal of the locust army is to remove the Word of God from the earth.  That too is a huge lie and there is no bible to support it.  The scripture specifically states (Revelation 9:4) the locust army will be attacking everyone who does not have the seal of God in their foreheads. Meaning, the locust army be attacking all the sinners and unbelievers and wrongdoers and everyone who does not have the seal of God in their foreheads. So the movie has it completely backwards.  And these are only a few of the major lies being told in the movie, the consequence of which illustrates that if you're not truly saved according to scripture (i.e saved according to Acts 2:38) that Lucifer can still use you to spew lies on his behalf even though your intentions may be good.

OK, I'll admit, a film based on religious predictions would slightly turn me off, however there are others I've watched that didn't push it as strongly as this one did. I mean, the union of bible and apocalypse just can't be easily done. To have people continuing salvation as gore should be underway just leaves a bad taste in one's mouth ... but then it depends on if you're here to watch salvation or you're here to watch mayhem.

For me, discussing the accuracy is a moot point anyway. 'Biblical fact' and any derivation thereof is an oxymoron.

In any case, if you're starving for a new apocalypse film, I'd do a rewatch of something else. This just doesn't even come near satisfying.

On the comedic side, Rapture Palooza offers some mayhem, and maybe even closer to 'biblically factual.'",1425168000,,850,4.7687074829931975
6518768,4,B00M0GM2NA,"A number of family oriented movies based on faith have been coming out over the past year to decent reception by the public. But for the most part they deal with someones conversion or discovery of faith more often than not in a country setting where the most difficult temptation found is whether or not to marry the good girl or the bad one. As for faith based horror films they're even harder to find. Not so any longer.

THE REMAINING takes the concept of purgatory found in movies like LEFT BEHIND and turns it upside down, combining it with the found footage idea to make an interesting and at times terrifying movie. Young couple Dan and Skyler are getting married. Their best friends Tommy, Jack and Allison are there to enjoy the festivities with them as are their family and other friends. After the ceremony and during the reception a loud noise erupts and the entire reception hall shakes, windows begin to shatter and people begin to fall in place on the floor apparently dead in their tracks.

In a state of panic everyone begins to wonder if were under some form of attack or bio-hazard. Before long they realize that this is the end of days and those who were believers have been taken to Heaven leaving the rest behind. The friends finally find one another and start to find some place safe to hole up. As they head out to the streets their barraged with falling hailstones the size of footstools, driving them into another building. When this dies down they decide to try and find a different place for shelter and a young girl named Sam joins them.

On their way to that different location something swoops down and scoops up Skyler, flying into the sky with her before dropping her in the middle of the road. Torn and broken, the group comes to her aid, picking her up and heading for the nearest building, a church. There they find a number of other survivors and as the film progresses they begin to discuss why they each think they are there, what caused them not to be taken.

As the night progresses they discover more about what it was that came down to take Skyler. They realize that the loud noise they heard from time to time was what could be Gabriels horn. The church is attacked by the demons they faced earlier forcing them to hide in the cellar as a last resort. Their faith is tested and in some strengthened. But will it be enough to still be saved in the end?

While Im not a fan of found footage movies this one actually works, moving back and forth between the found footage and the standard movie style. It still makes you wonder why someone would continue to shoot a movie with everything going on around them but thats been a big problem with all movies that use this style. Not only that but Id love to find out just what battery these people are using for the camera and their cell phones since mine would have died long before any in this film did.

Being a movie thats talking about the rapture and end of the world you would think the film would be preachier than it is. But the fact is that it offers a nice combination of story and discovery of faith than most. Not only that but the acting here is better than the majority of the horror films being released these days not to mention better than some major Hollywood releases. Even though you won't recognize most of the names on view here they all do a tremendous job in this film. In addition to this being a faith based film it is also a horror film of sorts with enough jumps and scares for even the most jaded of horror fans.

In reading several reviews and comments on this film Ive found that those without faith tend to offer the most violent and insulting critiques of the movie. Rather than base those reviews on the content of the film they instead go off on rants about religion and Christians and continue to call this propaganda rather than a movie based on the beliefs of those involved with the production. Had it been a movie with a coven of witches chanting around a campfire theyd have talked about how cool and evil that was, not because they believe in it but because it doesnt offend their superior attitudes toward religion. If you don't believe fine, at least take away a good story and great acting from this movie. If you do believe though youll get more from it.

I only heard two trumpets blow.  There should be more plagues to be seen than what we see here.  And I'd love to see more vivid details in what is sent to earth.  That takes a lot of CGI.  But on the whole it was interesting, just wondering what was coming next.

From a religious perspective?  No, I don't think our universe is made up of angry gods and demons.  And if there were one god . . . one LOVING god, I know he wouldn't sit idley by and let his beloved creation suffer, either by the terms of rapture or in our every day experience as we do.  The sin of omission is as great as the sin of commission.  In other words what you didn't do can be just as bad, if not worse, than what you did do.  Especially when it comes to allowing suffering.  So, then you're left with an important question . . . does God sin?  However religion is about getting the masses to follow.  And not to question.  Because as soon as you begin to question . . . to reason . . . the whole house of cards crumbles.  Anyway, as a movie, like THE OMEN, it makes for fun horror fare!",1424476800,,1223,4.050209205020921

Acting was pretty good, only break in believability was towards the end. Movie wise they did very well. The horror feel was there without going overboard into the realm of 'most body count' or 'most gore' (where too many horror shows rely for a crutch.) Camera work and lighting was outstanding and the director kept it up with the rest of the film.
Plot wise is a stretch of Revelations from 6:12 to 9: 5 but not a break of it... just stretching it.
The overall emphasis is the grief and loss accompanying the events of 1st Thess 4:13 -18, called the Rapture by certain Christians.
The movie ends just as the Fifth Trumpet sounds and the locusts from Rev 9:15 appear (though the tail of one is seen earlier.)

Interesting take on the book of Revelations. I like how they glossed over the seven seals and left them in the realm of current events. Dropped us straight into the days of Noah (literally giving in marriage at the first Trumpet.) The shock value of realizing that 'It could be you,' is quite a moment for fence sitting Christians or those whom have not taken up their calling yet.

Besides the religious theme, it was horribly acted and the plot was lazy. Two hours after the rapture started the characters already buried people in a church basement? What?

6518988,3,B00M0GM2NA,"Scary but Uninspiring.

First of all, if a movie is using the book of Revelations as it's source material, guess what... yep. It will be preachy at times. No kidding. If Biblical scenarios don't interest you... don't watch it.

(Spoiler Alerts) With that out of the way, the most pleasant thing the film has to offer is... death. Yes, death is the salvation and reward, for all who choose faith. Yay. And their deaths are violent, ugly, and unpleasant!! Hallelujah.

First, the rapture is rather horrific to watch. The air get's cold, the believers fall down, and their eyes glaze over with a milky white haze. At this point, all the unbelievers are probably very happy they are unbelievers.

Alas, the Earth is now more like Hell. This is where the film caught my interest. Trumpets sound. Storms drop burning blocks of ice. Flapping demonic spirits swoop down and grab people... horrific and chilling.

The film becomes a bit like ""Cloverfield,"" unfortunately. A group of very good looking 20 somethings run about, looking to survive... but get picked off, one by one. The only question is, which ones will die as believers... and which ones will die cursing God?

(Major spoiler alert). Now comes the major bummer FOR ME.  There is a love triangle. A beautiful brunette has a jerk for a boyfriend. After seven years, the man cannot make a commitment to her. Meanwhile, the jerk has a friend, a nicer and more caring guy. He secretly loves the neglected brunette. This nice guy buddy is braver, more caring, just a better person than the selfish boyfriend who takes the brunette for granted.

So, in the end, who finds faith? Inspired by his girlfriend's death, the jerk finds faith... and is picked off imediately. Mr. Nice guy resists, and the final scene has him die... faithless??

What saves this movie is how evil god can be since he's literally torturing people into believing in him. I mean he's vicious in mentally and physically assaulting people to the point where they have no choice but to believe. In that regard it's incredibly scary. God can be and is as vicious as Jason or any other super evil psycho killer you've ever seen. I would for sure not piss him off unless I wanted to be torn up by demons.

It doesn't take long for them to understand that they are ""The Remaining"". You meet characters within the film who seem surprised that they were not caught up in the rapture...as they punched their time clock at church.....were ""spiritual"" and seemed to help their fellow man. Yet none of these things is the pathway into the kingdom of heaven. Each person makes the decision for themselves....to die as a believer or to die as a non believer....but you will die.

6519026,5,B00M0GM2NA,"I bought the regular DVD version a few days ago and watched it with my family. I must say that this isn't your 'typical' Christian or religious movie. For starters, this has a top notch  cast of well respected and current young and up and coming actors such as Alexa Vega, Shaun Sipos, Johnny Pacar, Italia Ricci, Bryan Dechart, and Liz E. Morgan. It has great special effects and a well written script that definitely kept us on the edge of our seats, particularly concerning the 'fallen ones'.  I also found the movie to not be very 'preachy' nor did I think it tries to hit viewers over the head with 'religious talk' , even though the characters go through such decision making at times.  No one prays 'the sinner's prayer' while looking at the camera in other words and the movie's interpretation of the rapture was very interesting to say the least.  For those, like myself, who do fall in line with Christianity and a Christian belief system, the movie may seem quite a bit different from what we're used to seeing as far as the 'end times' goes. As I've already mentioned, the movie's take on the rapture theory that many Christians believe will happen during the last days was very different.  There's no 'neatly folded or piles of clothes laying around' and these scenes are neck in neck with the 'fallen ones' as far as running your blood cold goes.  The book of Revelation, which is naturally alluded to, also seems to occur in a more rapid sequence than the typically pushed 'seven year tribulation' that one commonly sees in other 'end times' Christian based films. Overall, this a great movie that I recommend for those looking for either a different take on Christian eschatology or for an unusual apocalyptic thriller that entertains without too much moralizing.",1423526400,,1779,4.72258064516129

Much about the film is entertaining, with some good scares. But it does get a bit heavy handed at points where you feel like you paid your money to be preached to. The worst example is when a minister regains his faith after being left behind during the Rapture, and his message is obvious and unnecessarily long winded. Far better are the quieter moments when characters make discoveries about what's going on and realize their faith is what will help them deal with it. This is  particularly true in the last few moments, when one of the lead characters realizes why some people are being killed by demons and others are not.

Still  nice to see a film that does not drop the F bomb with every other breath they take.  Starts to get a little Pentecostal Preachy in a few spots then backs off fast, so does not spoil the file from an entertainment aspect. To review the film as a FILM and not begin some religious debate over the content (FILM-which is why we normally bother to read the reviews in the first place), it was a well-made and very solid movie, acted well, and did not skimp on the attempts to put parts of the Book of Revelations into a film format.  For a Christian intended film  released for general audience, it was downright very good and did entertain as well as encourage you  in a gentle way really  to conduct self-examination.  I give it 5 stars as the Book of Revelations is HARD to try and put into a film version and to do it with an eye towards keeping it in a real-life framework (and not get all schlocky with the effects).  My only disappointment  there was so much more from Revelations they could have brought inmuch more  to the point I rather hope they do 3-4 sequels picking up where they left off but with a new group of folks:  Like the living dead Romero films do  the story progresses, and each new film picks it back up, but with new people, and keeps developing the timeline.  I will say they had to go, only as far as they did in this one  because to try and take the particular group they focused on further, would have over-stretched the credibility of the story that surrounded these key characters.

Because the truth of Christianity alleviates the freaky deaky that's in this. Well done, great production value, directing, acting. Really liked the play out of the film, we all were hanging in our dark living room as each scene unfolded.

May have to buy and watch every so often. I read Bible daily but will read it with some new fervor just to see how this film interpreted the end times. Pretty nifty. My faith in Christ has always been, I hope this touches those who live off thrill rides but forget the biggest thrill ride of all. Amen.",1423267200,6,672,4.508196721311475
6519075,5,B00M0GM2NA,"I enjoyed every moment of it!  If you're not Christian, you'll probably still enjoy it as a horror movie because the acting and pacing is great!

It starts with some cheese - a wedding celebration, but that is SOON over as the rapture begins!  Then its action and unfolding from there on out.  This is a Christian movie, so don't be shocked to learn it has to do with Christian principles and the book of Revelation.  Unlike a lot of well-meaning Christian movies, this one has SUPERB ACTING and several terrifying moments!  I LOVED IT!  It is SO refreshing to see a Christian movie that is not covered in flowers!  It's scary, dark and well done!  If they made more movies like this people would realize faith isn't a crutch, its about strength and facing those demons!

To clarify for the movies sake, Christianity is different from other religions because its not about ""earning"" your way into heaven if your goods outweigh your bads!  NO!  Its about recognizing that we ALL fall short of the grace of God and therefore its about being forgiven through a personal relationship with Christ.  So once certain individuals in the movie accept Christ, they FACE THEIR DEMONS, believe me, in graphic detail.

I am adding this movie to my collection.  Its a GREAT horror movie and a good Christian movie!!!!",1423180800,2,1303,4.70353982300885

6519077,5,B00M0GM2NA,"Different Take on the rapture, which was nice.  For example (spoiler alert), the bodies just dropping dead and not disappearing and leaving the clothes behind.  This movie was scary, as will the end times be when it happens.  I may even have enjoyed this more than the new ""Left Behind"" movie (original was better.) Some reviews are accusing this movie of being preachy or religious propaganda, but hey, the producers make no secret about this being about the rapture.  The word ""rapture"" even appears on the cover.  So if you didn't want to be preached to, then why did you rent or buy a movie about the rapture to begin with?  My only complaint is that the ""plagues,"" for lack of a better word, were happening too quickly which will not be the case most likely, but I guess they took liberties to fit as many of the horrors of the end times into a 90 minute movie as they could. I'm okay with that.  Great casting, great special effects, and overall entertaining and scary.",1423180800,,975,4.537142857142857

I kept giving it chances and just hoped that things would get better, but at the end I was just annoyed, upset, and happy it was over. If you don't mind the religious aspect being pushed real hard, it's probably not a bad movie, but it just bugged the hell right into me.",1422921600,4,434,4.304878048780488

Special effects were pretty well done, acting was good enough.  I gave it a 3 star because while I didn't like the message, I also was trying to be objective about the effort that was put into making it, and everyone is free to state their opinion ... so, yeah, it was okay.

6519094,1,B00M0GM2NA,"This is straight up Evangelical Christian PROPAGANDA. (And I mean that in the worst of ways). The message is this: If you're a good person, have treated others well, and have generally done the right thing but aren't bible-banging on your knees praying for forgiveness, then too bad! Crazy, super fast fallen angel, demon things with scorpion tales are going to pour from the sky and kill you. I could possibly have stomached the Christian propaganda if the action was good and if it were more about the creatures, but you barely see them and it's mainly a bunch of privileged white kids running around whining about their emotions and god. I try to give movies the benefit of the doubt and watch them on their own terms, but this movie is vomit inducing.",1422748800,13,755,4.641791044776119

I thought it a unique method bringing the scripture to a medium that might just get it some attention.  With all that said, the film itself is well done and the tension and confusion and the fear are conveyed with skill.  Sure, it was preachy, but it also made me jump a couple of times.",1422748800,3,404,4.2894736842105265

6519099,5,B00M0GM2NA,"""The Remaining"" wasn't what I was expecting, and that's a good thing.  After seeing the trailer, I had gotten the impression that this was another ""found footage"" movie.  But that isn't the case, at least not entirely.  It's take on the ""rapture"" was quite unique.  Typically the bodies are taken and the clothing is left behind, but in ""The Remaining"" the souls are taken and the bodies fall down dead.  This worked quite well for a horror movie.  I also liked that the movie didn't rely on cheap scares to provide the elements of fright.  I did jump once or twice, but overall ""The Remaining"" was story-driven.  Except for the opening wedding scene and a few moments here and there, the action was non-stop.  The violence was quite intense at times, though not bloody.  There was also a strong spiritual element, as you would expect from a movie about the ""rapture.""  Every character, at one point or another, was forced to choose whether they would embrace or reject true faith.  This was done in a thought-provoking way that did not distract from the story or from the horror the characters were experiencing.  I have to admit that I really enjoyed this one!  It was much better than average.",1422662400,13,1196,4.6875
6519100,4,B00M0GM2NA,"Thought it was very unusual and interesting! I definitely would say it did beat ""Left Behind"" and other movies that are like
this kind of stuff, but hey this did turn out spooky and tripping for me. my wife couldn't finish watching this
though, but of course this was different from the Bible.... the rapture is not gonna be leaving bodies around
without souls taken! that was silly to do for the movie the way it was portrayed....

6519121,1,B00M0GM2NA,Aside from being the most trite christian propaganda this is just a bad movie. Utterly trite and predictable/,1422576000,7,109,5.111111111111111
6519122,4,B00M0GM2NA,"Fifteen minutes into the film Skylar (Alexa PenaVega) proclaims, ""Biblical end of the world"" and still couldn't find the rapture in the Bible. Of course people who claim it is aliens are laughed at by those who credit God with the situation. Much of the action takes place in a church. The director/writer/editors were savvy enough to know a long church scene would get boring so they toss in newscast showing the situation at various locations. The film also comes across as sci-fi horror with creatures in the mist. This made the film far more entertaining than that Nicolas Cage disaster film. While the planes dropping from the sky in this film weren't as well done in ""Left Behind"" you were able to emotionally experience the event better. I personally liked the library girl of all the characters.

Now there were some issues I had. Why is it that so many people from the ""Free Love"" generation get ""taken?"" We also discover one had to have a personal relationship with Jesus to get raptured, yet kids and new born babies are part of this also. I know the Catholic Church created ""Limbo"" to account for where unbaptized babies would go when they died. They weren't in heaven, but didn't know they weren't in heaven. But then the church did away with Limbo, and now I don't know what happens to unbaptized babies which would most likely be in the same situation as kids before ""the age of accountability"" would go should (or when) there is a rapture.

Now in the Catholic church's defense, they are not as big into that end times stuff as they are baptizing heathen babies in the third world. However, I am glad to see the Apocalyptic Christians have this all worked out and are not as messed up as those of us who have dabbled in Catholicism.

4 stars for people of faith.

The couple and their surviving friends are forced to examine their lives, love and faith as they must choose between redemption and survival. Scary, well acted and sobering. Decent special effects and at 88 minutes, it wastes little time getting going. Not for those who easily get motion sickness by fast camera movements. That said, this is one of the better horror films that utilizes the 'found footage' feeling without overdoing it sibce It isn't used throughout the entire film.

For those who liked ""Cloverfield"", ""Rec 2"" and ""The Mist"", you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",1422489600,6,698,5.176991150442478
6519125,4,B00M0GM2NA,"Here's my synopsis of the Left Behind movie.  Boring stuff for the first half of the movie, the rapture, then more boring stuff for the rest of the movie. Now here's a synopsis of The Remaining. Boring wedding for the first quarter of the movie, the rapture, then exciting, suspenseful, and scarey stuff throughout the rest of the movie.

This movie would be great for Halloween, as it makes a good attempt at showing the scarey side of what could happen to those who miss The Rapture.  IMHO, it's the best Christian horror flick I've ever seen. It's not like there are that many Christian horror movies to choose from, but most of them are kind of lame, and this one wasn't lame at all.

As far as horror flicks in general, this is mildly scarey, but I still wouldn't recommend it for little kids. I don't remember hearing any profanity, and there were no sex scenes.  I think for a rapture themed movie, they did a pretty good job.",1422489600,,933,4.464705882352941

6519130,3,B00M0GM2NA,"Fans of B-rated eschatological studies, and lovers of B-rated teen horror films, step right up, coz here's the best of both worlds. Young twenty something adults get married, and at their reception, the rapture occurs. The bride and groom, the best man and brides maid, and another friend, are not raptured.  Instead, they film everything with their iPhones, reality TV style. Do you hear that? The booming sound means the first trumpet is blown, so everybody runs outside into the hail, and fire.  The beast that flies around, and inflicts the pain of a scorpion wrecks havoc, planes fall out of the sky, and so on. Much of the film borrows from the ""LEFT BEHIND"" movie, including when everybody runs to a church, where the preacher is not raptured,  since he didn't really believe.  For Baptists who take this stuff literally, you will not be very impressed. The raptured bodies are left on earth, just the souls go to heaven.  Also, there is NO mention of an antichrist, no mark of the beast, no Israeli war or rebuilding of the temple.  For those who believe that rapture is an analogy for being taken up into heaven spiritually, as St. Paul was, the horror movie esthetics and shoddy theology will drive you crazy.  The movie looks, sounds, and plays out like any horror movie you've watched in the last ten years, right down to the young adults running around with their iPhones documenting everything, as tho life not viewed thru a camera, isn't life at all.

On the plus side, the writer and director certainly have strived to insert the need to have real, abiding faith in order to spiritually know God.  People get saved, make confessions of faith, and experience conversion. IF you go into this movie looking for little more than that, you won't be disappointed.  As far as a modern horror-disaster movie, with some reality TV vibes from shaking video cameras, you can make a case that it will appeal to a younger mindset. I don't have much to say about the acting, its not good, but except for a few places, its not amateur either.  The CGI effects, during disaster scenes, are done well enough to allow the audience to believe what they see.  I was a little surprised the film only ran about 83 minutes.  No doubt getting into doctrine, or the political rise of the antichrist, could have easily added another 10 minutes to the movie, and provided more biblical substance, but this isn't a movie for investigators of eschatology. Its really a teen horror movie, with a coating of Christian piety and redemption.  Since it isn't so heavy handed with prophecy, and biblical quotes, you get a movie that entertains more than the LEFT BEHIND movies.  As a Christian, tho, I thought it might contain a little more biblical reference, either allegorical or literal.

Leave this movie for teenagers and young adults, who love horror movies, and who attend a protestant church.  It seems to be produced for that market, and that market only.",1422403200,,2946,4.745098039215686
