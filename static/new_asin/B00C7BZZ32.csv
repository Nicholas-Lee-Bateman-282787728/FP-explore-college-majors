5694179,5,B00C7BZZ32,"THE KINGS OF SUMMER is an entertaining coming-of-age movie, reminiscent of STAND BY ME, but with a lighter touch.

Joe (Nick Robinson), Patrick (Gabriel Basso) and Biaggio (Moises Arias) are a trio of Mid-West teens who have decided to flee their parents.  Joe's dad (Nick Offerman) is a wisecracking, insensitive ""s.o.b."".  Patrick's folks (Megan Mullally, Marc Evan Jackson) are on the ""creepy"" side, and, except for one brief scene, we don't really meet Biaggio's parents, but he's a bit ""weird,"" so that should tell us something.

The truth is that, from a teenager's standpoint, all parents are insensitive, creepy and/or weird.

In an ultimate act of independence, the three boys decide to spend their summer building a ramshackle house in the woods and living off the land.  The house goes up amazingly fast, and while the parents and the police (led by Mary Lynn Rajskub) search for them, the teens have a great time.  The adventure, however, turns south when Kelly (Erin Moriarty), enters the boys' domain...and jealously rears its ugly head.

With a sharp eye for the beauty of nature, Jordan Vogt-Roberts directed Chris Galletta's well-written  screenplay.  The actors are uniformly excellent in their individual roles.

The Blu-Ray disc from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains audio commentary by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, writer Chris Galletta, and actors Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso and Moises Arias, deleted and extended scenes, and three ""behind the scenes"" featurettes.

5694180,3,B00C7BZZ32,"I love this movie.  I saw it twice in the theater, recommended it to all my friends, and I'm eager to buy it on Blu-Ray and watch it again.  But you can't expect anyone to pay $28.99 for a movie.  Lower the price. People like me who actually know about this movie and want to buy it don't deserve to be gouged, and the fine folks who made this movie don't deserve to be punished by the poor sales that will result that ridiculous price.",1379548800,3,436,4.105882352941176
5694181,5,B00C7BZZ32,"This is one of those movies that is interesting from the moment it starts. When I was younger, I always had ideas of doing what these boys did. I thought it would be fun to build a ""fort"" or ""house"" in the forest behind our home. Of course, I never actually did it. My parents would have kicked my ass for that. This is a great coming of age movie. You feel great when it's done, like you actually watched something that didn't waste your time.
I review is meant to persuade or dissuade someone from watching a movie. I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone I know, of all ages. Check it out; I know I will again.",1379203200,22,625,4.216666666666667
5694182,5,B00C7BZZ32,"""Kings of Summer"" does something that few movies are able to do. It captures a moment perfectly. For anyone who has been a middle class fifteen year boy this is a movie that captures that perfectly and then tells a great nontraditional coming of age teenage rebellion story. For everyone who has never been a fifteen year old boy it tells an excellent with amazing characters. Every actor in this movie is fantastic. This movie should not be missed.",1373932800,3,449,4.69620253164557
5694183,3,B00C7BZZ32,"One of the best movies of 2013 so far has been the coming-of-age drama MUD.  And now, during a summer blockbuster season, another coming-of-age drama/comedy has arrived.  THE KINGS OF SUMMER had a very enticing trailer, making it look like a good-natured story of three boys who run away from home to live in the nearby forest in a house of their own construction.  It features funny actors such as Nick Offerman and Megan Mullaly.  (Yes, I know they are husband and wife in real life.)

The movie ended up being more (and less) than what I expected.  It is a far darker, more serious exploration of the family lives of these boys, particularly Joe (Nick Robinson) who lives with his recently widowed father (Offerman) a bitter, sarcastic man who is gruff almost to the point of abuse on his teen son.  The two are ""dealing"" with their loss by lashing out at each other, and Joe finally has enough and decides to move out.  He encourages his friend Patrick (Gabriel Basso) to join him.  Patrick has very overbearing parents who are experts at embarrassing him.  These two old friends are joined by the VERY odd Biaggio (Moises Arias), a bit of an outcast who simply clings to these two and becomes part of their lives.

The movie constantly struggles with tone.  It clearly wants to be full of lighthearted moments...gentle humor and ironic observations about how kids and parents often don't see eye-to-eye.  Yet the relationship between Joe and his dad is so caustic that we are much more likely to cringe than chuckle or smile.  The actors play everything straight, which is what they SHOULD do, but the script makes it tough to balance the comedy and drama.  The two want to exist at the same time, but the drama smothers that comedy.  There certainly are laughs in the film, particularly around the odd (and highly unbelievable) Biaggio.

In fact, much of the film just felt false.  Biaggio is a quirky kid, no doubt with some deep mental challenges.  But his strange utterances are mostly funny...but in a way that makes you realize this character could not exist in the real world.  He is a comic construction.  That's fine...except the film clearly intends to be ""realistic.""  Also, Joe's dad is, I'm sure, meant to be a character for whom we feel some sympathy.  A nice, gruff dad who is rattled to the core by his wife's death.  But he is SO mean to everyone around him that it's hard not to hate him.  He just doesn't feel well thought out.  It's possible a guy like this exists...but he just feels wrong.

I liked individual scenes in the film, and I enjoyed many of the performances.  It has plenty to recommend it.  But the screenplay (and by extension the direction) clearly aspires to more meaning than is actually contained therein.  Coming-of-age films have hard-won lessons, tears, laughter and a sense of relief and of character maturing.  This film checks all those boxes, but clumsily.  And of course these kinds of films need to have some sort of romance as well.  Yet the female character in this film is made to behave in ways towards the 2nd half that betray her behavior in the first half.  Instead of a sweetness, an innocence, KINGS OF SUMMER is more bitter and angry.

Don't get me wrong...I don't need my movies to be sweet and gentle and happy.  But when the film is harsh and bitter even though you can tell it WANTS to be sweet and gentle...that's a problem.  So while I marginally recommend KINGS OF SUMMER, I can't also help feeling very let down by it.",1372550400,5,3489,4.614634146341463
5694184,5,B00C7BZZ32,"This may not attract audiences immediately, due to the lack of over-the-top CGI and big name celebs... however it is easily in the top five movies of the past decade. With a very well wrote script, incredibly talented cast, and a story that will have you laughing and on the edge of your seat; this movie is not to be missed. Kings of Summer is a film that teens and adults can relate to, and has you wishing you could join the cast in their summer adventure.",1372464000,4,459,4.287356321839081
5694185,4,B00C7BZZ32,"""The Kings of Summer"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of two best friends, Joe and Patrick, both 15 and just having finished their HS freshman year. Joe's dad is heavy-heanded (""my house, my rules!"") and Patrick's parents are outright bizzare. Joe hatches a plan to build a cottage out in the woods over the summer. They are joined a strange kid, Biaggio, who works himself up to be a great (and funny) sidekick. As the boys are working on building the shack, they are equally enjoying being out in the woods or daydraming when they feel like it. Once the cottage has been built, they invite some achool friends over, including beautiful Kelly (played by up-and-coming Erin Moriarty). Joe is smitten by her, but she seems to be attracted more to Patrick. At this point we are about half-way into the movie and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: a few months ago we had a fantastic coming-of-age movie called ""Mud"", and now this movie. It is hard to truly compare the two, as ""The Kings of Summer"" is a very different kind of ""coming of age"" movie, with the boys being 4-5 years older than in ""Mud"". Here, the themes are more directed towards the tensions with the parents on the one hand, and surrounding the girl on the other hand. Stylistically, the movie is a curious mix of a number of genres, some scenes being almost sitcom-like, others reminding of magic-realism (lots of late afternoon orange sunlight) and of nature-adventure (lots of shots of animals in the woods), yet other scenes building suspense on the outcome of it all. Somehow it works. The fact that this is a fairly short movie works to its advantage as this zips by in no time. Kudos also to Ryan Miller for scoring that nice soundtrack. I would be remiss not to mention that this movie was filmed entirely in Ohio (where I am). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts makes it look beautiful!

This movie was well received at the 2013 Sundance film festival (where it was shown as ""Toy's House""). The movie opened today here at my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati, but regretfully the screening I attended was not well attended. I hope that is not a sign of things to come. Regardless, ""The Kings of Summer"" is a different kind of coming-of-age movie that is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD.",1371772800,4,2393,4.601873536299766
5694186,3,B00C7BZZ32,"A couple of high school boys frustrated with their home lives set off with another kid to run away and build a makeshift house. The local community is searching for them while they learn to live off the land. The appearance of a girl that the leader of the boys likes creates a rift within them. This unlikely scenario is fun to watch, with its likeable characters, and familiar teenage angst. Problems with girls and parents are typical of teen boys, but the building of a home and being able to not be found are quite unusual. This one is pretty good, though flawed, so The Kings of Summer is a likeable film.",1370822400,,611,4.415929203539823

5694200,2,B00C7BZZ32,"After a fairly funny and intriguing launch through the first 15 minutes, this film crashes.  Many squirm-worthy scenes come through like a film-school assignment: write a parody of 1990's edgy young adult humor, but have mismatched characters read the lines and mug the deadpan expressions and side-glances.  The writing is so essentially narcissistic that none of the characters is developed (especially no females; they are props in this movie).  The only voice is the writer's, who seems to be working something out for himself.  He is not untalented, as several early scenes are funny and some later isolated elements are good (e.g., the elevator visual at the end) -- but much of the movie is memorably bad (e.g., the cystic fibrosis joke is ""sooo edgy and I-can't-believe-they-went-there""?....not really, it's just an old formula ridden like a rented mule in this B movie).",1518393600,,879,5.169014084507042

What are the big problems with this movie? Well, first off, this movie made me feel pretty uncomfortable in that teen age-y way. It dealt with things in a bawdy sort of way. I like to think that I didn't fight with my parents this much and then awkwardly unload my anger. These characters do that. And of course, this movie takes the familiar turn of rebelliously going to toilet humor. The characters were too immature and angry for me to identify with. I guess my family was more civilized and sophisticated, not to brag, because it was just luck. I got a very summer camp-y feel out of this movie, and the feeling that the characters in this movie were too angry to have a cool conversation with. Everything they wanted to do revolved around hating their parents and wanting to break the rules. I totally understand that, seeing how oppressive their parents are, but it's just not my story. Both in real life, and this movie.

A few more of the bad things? The music was a little too intense, as well as some of the directing choices. You got the feeling that something devastating and amazing was happening, but really, the story was kind of light hearted. It was nothing more than a few affluent teenagers running away from home. The directing devices didn't match the tone. This movie didn't always know what it was. This is as opposed to something like ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" that absolutely knew what it was on every page of its existence.

Anyways, the good things about this movie? The screenplay was a near-brilliant comedy. The moment when the kids are at their home in the woods, and they are playing Monopoly was a riot. The line ""If I roll a 6, an 8, or a 9.........."" was hilarious, and one of the best comedy lines of the past 10 years. It was hysterical that Monopoly kept destroying families, and it was kind of good that our protagonist didn't always get the girl. That was a nice touch of realism. So, what I think happened was that screenwriter Chris Galletta kind of got worked over, because he wrote a masterfully funny screenplay, but some of the directing and acting choices were a near miss. That also brings us to the acting, which had some flaws, and I don't know if the teenage kids totally got why this was so funny, and I don't know if they totally got their lines. Anyways, it seemed like a sort of cut-and-paste job, and an overall uneven effort. Some serious flaws and cracks in the foundation of this movie were exposed. As good as some of the humor was, I have to knock this back down to 1.5 - 2 stars.",1491264000,,2812,4.372848948374761

OK, maybe one thing, I could have done without the ""rabbit hunting"" scene which was bad enough to watch, but then kept dragging on and was far too graphic for the type of movie this was.

Megan Mullaly (Patrick's mom) and the character Biaggio were absolutely hysterical. But what a treat it was to see every part played to perfection. Just can't rave about this enough for a funny, feel-good movie that has its moments of tenderness, without trying to get too deep or too sappy.

5694277,5,B00C7BZZ32,"This is an excellent coming-of-age film, the kind that has become almost nonexistent since the turn of the century with its relentless, quibbling identity politics and social dissolution. Written by newcomer Chris Galletta, The Kings of Summer takes place in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, the same all-American town in which Calvin & Hobbes creator Bill Watterson lives; and like the comic strip, the film is unabashedly traditional in its portrayal of boyhood. It is this unabashedness that makes The Kings of Summer not only a rare film but a daring one, too. Set in the middle of nature, Nature (with a capital N) and naturalness pervade the film, its script, and its characters. Indeed, what makes Joe and Patrick so endearing is that they are neither ridiculous, over-the-top caricatures of masculinity nor watered-down, enervated half-men whose lives would be incomplete without divorced, high-power lawyer mothers or the ubiquitous, ever-competent gal pal whose main purpose is to remind viewers that, yes  for the love of God, yes, we know  girls can also build makeshift shanties and skin rabbits.

But this is a movie for and about boys, not girls.

Joe and Patrick are simply ordinary boys yearning for manhood. Not sexually disoriented boys, not transitioning boys, but just boys: natural, uncorrupted, and free from that crushing pseudo-intellectual baggage we heap on todays youth.

The most philosophically rebellious dialogue in the movie occurs between Joe and the oddball Biaggio.

Biaggio: I don't really perceive myself as having a gender. Is that a problem?
Joe: Well, its not great.

But thats precisely what makes this film a great achievement in the first quarter of the 21st century. For those who are nauseated by the endless critiques and hectoring of the PC crowd, this is your antidote.",1484524800,,1806,5.164383561643835

This movie tells the story of a teenager who runs away from home to build a house and a life in the woods, with his best friend and a peculiar tag-along.

It breaks the mold of the typical coming of age story by being both ordinary and fantastical at times, with infinite moments competing with a fleeting present, the desire to grow-up too soon, and the struggles of and between love, family, and friendship.",1474934400,,571,4.377358490566038

Because of the divide between comedy and drama, ""The Kings of Summer"" feels as though it has a multiple personality disorder, not being able to situate itself with one clear thread throughout.

One of the boys is living with his sarcastic and gloomy Dad, a  man who is trying to do his best at raising his son after loosing his wife.  The other boy is a single child living with his parents, who are loving, but extremely over protective.  These two different types of overbearing situations, in combinations with the teenagers common feeling of invincibility, leads them to runaway from home to live in the wilderness, together with another teenage boy who is odd but caring.  Their escapade leads them through all kinds of adventures and learning experiences as they are forced to come of age.  I highly recommend this movie.",1465516800,9,802,4.810218978102189

There's also a touch of that pilot episode feel from 'Wonder Years,' but again, this isn't a period flick. The plot draws on modern family culture themes, while relying on a small town suburban backdrop which is a timeless mis en scene choice. Excellent casting.  Great for kinds 12 and up. Great for adults yearning to remember the tension of their first crush, or the resentment you felt when when your crush falls for your best friend, not you.

Joe is grieving with no where to turn, since his father is completely self absorbed and the sister has her own life.  Patrick's parents, really, who wouldn't want to leave them, they drove me crazy!  Bajio, so adorable and such an interesting character played so well.  Kelly could have been left out altogether, as she was the worst part of the movie.

5695485,4,B00C7BZZ32,"The Kings of Summer's strength lies mostly in the characters, but I wouldn't knock the writing either.  It's pretty solid too.

Nick Offerman plays the role of the sarcastic but funny father who likes to heavily discipline his son and feed him all kinds of additional punishment just to rub it in a little more (apparently since the son takes exception to his new girlfriend), Nick Robinson can't take his father's punishment anymore so he wants to build a house in the woods with his friends and hide/be free from all parental control, Moises Arias plays the friend with a very mysterious and almost meditative personality (I guess he's become one with the forest!) and Gabriel Basso (the other friend) is a wrestler who steals the love of Nick's life which results in fighting/tension between the two later.  And WOW does the mother of Gabriel Basso (Megan Mullally) remind me of my neighbor.  Same personality, voice, and face!  The only difference is that Megan's perhaps a tad more boisterous than my neighbor.

There's also a monopoly board game theme throughout the movie, such as hilariously leaving pieces behind as clues for the father to find where the teens are hiding.  Otherwise this movie is pretty exciting and captures the feeling of teenagers enjoying the great outdoors.  Actually the writing is really sharp related to the outdoor aspect.  These teens often have to rely on survival skills in order to live in their little (poorly constructed!) house, and they need quick reflexes to catch their rodent dinners.  I really think the father makes this movie better. Without his character, I wouldn't have found as much enjoyment.  That's not to say the movie revolves around his character, but rather he gives the storyline a lot of life and laughs.  He's a crucial character.  Moises character is also good.  Otherwise I enjoy the snake biting scene later on and how Moises intervenes, and how Nick tries to make it on his own when he immaturely abandons everyone (over a girl of course!)  Also Mary Lynn Rajskub of 24 fame (she's pouty faced Chloe!) plays a police officer with a wimp for a partner, but this story never goes far at all.

Yeah, it's sort of odd how the story doesn't take the missing teen aspect more seriously.  Obviously if I had a son and found out he's missing, I'm not going to assume he's doing alright living away from me with his friends.  I'm going to think the worst, so it's unbelievable that the father never showed more emotion.  In fact this movie seems to avoid emotion even when you think it's bound to come up eventually and focuses on friendships struggles and recovery instead.  Perhaps that's a good thing since it avoids clichs.  Pretty solid writing overall though.  I was entertained and felt satisfied overall.",1439337600,,2771,4.813953488372093

5695512,4,B00C7BZZ32,"Three kids, feeling their way through the anxieties of their mid-teens, get together to build a summer retreat in the woods and escape from a droll season in their parents' homes. It's hearty and funny, a great reminder of the unseen handcuff between independence and responsibility that floats into our lives at that age. The grown-ups are particularly hilarious as stiff, out-of-touch caricatures; everything we see them as during adolescence, rolled up and amplified by a few degrees. Moises Arias is the best of the young actors, playing a weird McLovin type who somehow falls into the partnership with two long-term buddies. His heavy gaze alone is usually enough to get me chuckling, and the cryptic, emotionally-detached lines that usually sprout from his lips moments later are absurdity at its best. It can get a little self-absorbed at times, and spirals off into navel-gazing in the third act, but for a good stretch in the middle it's prime coming-of-age goodness.",1424649600,,976,5.10625

5695528,4,B00C7BZZ32,"Everyone thinks their parents are crazy, but in the case of Joe, Patrick, & Biaggio, their parents really are nuts. Looking to escape the insanity of their every day lives, the boys decide one summer to build a cabin in the woods, where they can live off the land like men. Nick Robinson stars as Joe, and gives a performance that is out of this world. In a film that stars three kids in the woods, it would be very easy for things to turn stupid very quickly, but as the leader of the pack, Joe not only keeps the group together, but keeps the story together. No matter what this young man does over the course of his career, he will have a hard time duplicating what was easily a career defining performance. Robinson is paired with Disney star Moises Arias, who until now I thought was just this weird little guy they used to guest in their shows. Arias plays Biaggio, easily one of the funniest characters I've seen in a very long time, some of the things that come out of his mouth are just fall on the floor funny. As the kids enjoy their time in the woods, their parents really start to show their crazy, as they go on a hunt for the lost boys. The characters were all unique in their own way, but Joe's father, played by Nick Offerman, was far and away the best, leading the parents the same way, his son lead the boys. From gigantic wontons to turtles on kites, The Kings of Summer is an extremely enjoyable film and the rare instance of a film that I wish was longer. I truly loved every second of this smart coming of age comedy, for it's uniqueness and young exciting cast. Blending dramatic and comedic elements, The Kings of Summer is that perfect mix that takes you from laughter to tears and back again. For that, this film is an easy choice for one of our must see movies!",1416873600,,1789,4.295857988165681

5695553,4,B00C7BZZ32,"This was a really decent movie. In my opinion, it would deserve a 6.5-7/10. This movie was nothing like I thought it would be like, based on the previews. It is a very true testimony to teenage life. It is basically about two guy friends and another guy who weasels his way into the group. Together, these guys leave home (because they are in that teenage stage where you just want to be with your friends and want to be away from your parents) and move to the woods, and in the process, a search is launched for them when the parents think their kids ran off or got kidnapped. There is also a slight love story/conflict that protrudes, but this is not the essential theme to the movie. This is more of a story about friendship and being on your own, and facing conflict with friends and not leaving your friends behind.

This is a good movie, and worth the 1.5 hours it requires. I cannot say it was an incredible movie, but it was good. Its genuine and light-hearted. Not a very dramatic or thrilling movie, just one of those calm, tranquil, light, slightly comical and slightly quirky movies. It also has nick offerman and megan mullally in it, so you can't go wrong. It will put you in a good mood.

Parent's note: Recommended for 13+. It has a R rating due to language, but there is no nudity, or the wild thing, or wild situations present. Just about 10 uses of ""f"" and a few GD and S make this movie get a R rating. Also slight drug use, such as cigar and a little bit of teen drinking (these scenes are very subtle and quick).",1405382400,,1534,4.286206896551724

5695575,3,B00C7BZZ32,"I think Ive come to the realization that you just cannot be cool anymore unless you watch TV, and I mean regularly.  I never watch anything on television that doesnt involve some sort of competition or isn't some syndicated rerun of a show that was around when I was a teenager.  I don't really know why, but maybe it has to do with the fact that there are only so many hours in a day and only so much time I have allotted for in front of the TV and so I either watch brainless stuff I can veg out to while Im awaiting sleep to overtake me, or I watch a movie.  Still, with myself FINALLY getting on Twitter, I have come to see that everyone I follow is constantly tweeting about this show and that show and this actor in that show that I don't watch and thus have no idea who they are, and I feel so constantly out of the loop.

What does that have to do with this review?

Well, I had no idea who Nick Offerman was until I saw Were the Millers a few months ago, and then seeing him here and hearing all the OMG we love him come from everyone who has seen this or who Ive talked to about this made me realize that if I don't start watching TV soon Im not going to know who anyone is anymore.  I mean, this cast is made up almost entirely of television actors.

Nick RobinsonMelissa & Joey
Gabriel BassoThe Big C
Moises AriasHannah Montana and recently The Middle
Nick OffermanParks and Recreation
Erin  MoriartyOne Life to Live, Red Widow and now True Detective
And we all know who Megan Mullally is.

Seriously, Im embarrassed to admit this, but Ive seen NONE of these shows and knew who NONE of these people were, outside of Mullally, and thats because I watch SYNDICATED Will and Grace.

Im so out of touch.

So, maybe it is because of this un-coolness that I have, but I didn't fall head over heels for this like I had thought I was going to.  I liked it enough, but it all felt so very sitcom to me, and not in a good way.  It also felt so utterly underdeveloped, and while I liked the concept to a certain extent and I thought that Offerman was pretty fantastic, the character development here felt so clich and the actual build of the plot felt so skeletal.  It didn't help that the characters all felt so displaced, like none of them belonged in the real world, and the character of Colin was borderline Sid from The Descendants territory, to the point where I really wanted George Clooney to pop out of nowhere and punch him in the face, and I never want George Clooney to pop out of anywhere.

Oh wait, that was Robert Forster.  I like him.  He should have popped up in this movie.

Anyways, back to the point.  The Kings of Summer tells the story of misunderstood teens (go figure) who are fed up with their misunderstanding parents (go figure) who decide that they would be better off alone (go figure).  They decide to build a house in the woods where no one can find them and basically disappear (yay, original idea) but then things get murky and complicated when they both fall for the same girl (go figure) and she chooses the one that is not the chief protagonist (go figure).  Things fall apart, friendships are skewed and eventually the protagonists father turns out to be a pretty great guy and amends are made (go figure).

But getting there was sohollow.

I wanted more meat.  Instead we are given random shots of enjoyment and yet nothing to really build on, nothing to really make it all mesh together.  I think the focus on other things, like the girls and the parents, took away from what they really SHOULD have been developing, which was the friendship, comradery and innocence of the boys.

I mean, I love this concept despite the fact that I made fun of all the clichd aspects, but there was no character development outside of the obvious.  It felt like ideas strung along with no real development.  The fact that I saw this just a week ago and honestly kept forgetting what movie it was that I watched is not a good sign.

But Offerman is pretty hilarious and honestly feels grounded, even if his delivery felt somewhat displaced from the film itself.  His arc (which isn't really an arc since he was there the whole time and the only person who couldn't see it was his son) is the nicest in the film, even if it is a walking clich.",1397088000,,4265,4.321608040201005

I waited a few weeks and decided to watch it regardless of the bad reviews and I am glad I did.  This movie is brilliantly acted, the story line is real.  Will it win an Oscar?  No.  But was it fun to watch and enjoyable?  YES!!  The reviews that stated it was like watching paint dry clearly didn't watch the movie.  It had a great story line, great characters.  It was funny, it was emotional.  I would even watch it again.  Its a simple story of three young men who want to get away from their controlling parents and be men and act like adults and take care of themselves.

This movie fails to impart the crucial life-lessons that are a feature in YA films and instead relies on over-exaggerated ""evil"" or ""dorky"" parent roles, cliche' and unbelievable character struggles and horrible acting,  and attempts to make the fantasy of 10 year old boys into a feature film.

  While this film had potential to be a intriguing and entertaining YA film, it quickly nose-dived into a cheap film aimed at a YA audience I am not sure even exists.  I know 10 year olds who would not enjoy it and our teens could not even sit through the film.",1391990400,,762,4.734848484848484

It follows two boys that are friends wanting to distance themselves from their families by building a home in the woods to live in on their own. The movie has great acting, and lots of funny lines. Definitely an emotion movie. But good. I felt like I would have enjoyed it more if I was a middle aged parent or a 13 year old which is why I gave it three stars.

5695603,2,B00C7BZZ32,"The story didn't move much and it was a bit dark. It had some moments, but most fell flat. There was a scene where Joe kills a bunny and I thought it was too graphic and made the character less sympathetic to what he was going through. I really liked ""Moonrise Kingdom"" by comparison, a similar theme that came together and was much more uplifting and memorable.  The cast of ""The Kings Of Summer"" is talented, in particular ""Moises Arias"" who played the character of ""Biaggo"" but not enough to make the story come together.

If you find any of the following hilarious, this movie is for you: sarcasm, awkward dancing, witty family banter, lord of the flies, GIANT wonton soup dumplings, rabbit skinning.

This movie has a lot of character and is wonderfully charming.  You'll find endearing and down right hilarious characters that will leave you wishing for an extended version or outtakes just to see more Biaggio (what planet is he from) and Joe's Dad (the Dad who just can't help himself).",1388793600,,616,4.5225225225225225

This film is sweet, and funny, and stunningly, beautifully shot and well-edited and gorgeously acted... it was every single thing you hope that a movie will be - any movie, regardless of budget, should be this cohesive and pretty to look at and interesting start to finish.

And oh yeah, Alison Brie. But in the end none of those things really materialized. I didn't really care for any of the characters, the broken child-parent relationships just seemed kindof forced.

Bad decisions limit future options; absence of thought and planning lead to disorder; the grass on the other side of the fence is not as green as expected.  Order must be established before freedom can be realized. The family unit is designed to provide the order necessary for independence to be acquired.  Traditional standards serve best regardless of the many drawbacks caused by human failings and fate.  The boys also  learned that capacity for freedom and independence must precede their attainment.

It does demonstrate how we as parents and kids do not communicate well or understand each other at times!  Shows the emotion and struggle into adulthood quite well as we search to find ourselves and sort through the emotions into independent adulthood.  Very funny movie.  Also, the videographer did a stunning job using sunlight and nature as his back drop and has a great eye for capturing the beauty of our surroundings that we sometimes forget to stop and enjoy.

5695675,4,B00C7BZZ32,"Touching upon the teenage angst we've all felt while living with our parents, and the frustrations parents feel while living with teenagers, The Kings Of Summer is a movie that my 15 year old daughter and I truly enjoyed.

Best friends run away from home, to live in the woods.  To become men. Joined by a third-wheel who they never quite figure out, but who they accept just the same, these teenage boys are frustrated with their parents and are actively rejecting their authority by secretly building a house in the nearby forest.  Their initial sense of joyful relief, their emotional growth as they learn to figure things out on their own, and the girl who tug deeply at one boy's heartstrings, are all elements of a story that flow easily into a semi-dramatic, satisfying conclusion.

We laughed a lot watching this film, perhaps recognizing ourselves in the characters.  It is a drama, but one with a strong sense of the ridiculousness of life and the characters we are, as well as the ones we meet along the way.

I recommend this movie.  It's quirky, but the characters are real, the story is good, as is the acting. It's a movie that doesn't have sex or violence, but it does have a message that I  think both adults and teens can appreciate and learn from in the end.",1382400000,11,1277,4.5701754385964914

5695686,5,B00C7BZZ32,"Comparisons to Stand by Me are going to be obvious but this is actually a very different but equally enjoyable film. It tells the story of Joe (Nick Robinson  Boardwalk Empire) He is being raised by his father and they never quite see eye to eye, to the point where he just cant take it anymore.

He has best mate Patrick played by Gabriel Basso, in a leg cast which is never alluded too in the film, so well done him. He has the most perfectly over bearing parents. His mum is played with screen brilliance by the lovely Megan Mullally  Will and Grace. They are the sort that will drive you to experiment in drugs just to annoy them.  Anyway they decide to run away and build their own house in the woods and be kings of all they behold. Along the way they pick up little Biaggio (Moisas Arias). Joe has day dreams about Kelly and soon the fun starts to wane but the summer is far from over and things can only get better?

I really enjoyed this film; it is a coming of age tale and a mates story and one of childish innocence all wrapped up in a summer from heaven. Not a lot to dislike really. There is a lot of dry humour but this is so much more than a comedy and I can only recommend.",1381622400,6,1190,4.090128755364807

OK, it is about teen rebellion and summer love, but we liked it a lot.  With so many movies about mean teen girls and shallow relationships of this generation, this tells a warm story about the friendships and bonds between teen boys - the trust, anger and jealousy that comes and goes; a topic that doesn't often get explored in the movies. The best things: the actors were great and well cast; there were several scenes where the cinematography was great (beating the drums in the woods was one); it was a realistic/unrealistic fantasy escape we all might have had in high school.  We laughed, we were surprised and we were glad we watched it.  As the movie closed, I thought...those guys will be friends forever.",1381276800,52,843,4.526315789473684

5695698,4,B00C7BZZ32,"""The Kings of Summer"" from director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, uses a tried and tested teenage coming-of-age storyline with only one place to go, taking the obvious route to get to it. It therefore throws up few surprises along the way. What carries the movie and makes it something more than it might otherwise have been are the outstanding performances from the younger cast members, together with a series of magical inter-scene episodes which lighten and illuminate the tale's telling, enhanced by superb cinematography and an excellent soundtrack.

The film has more that its fair share of kludgy moments too but while these prevent it from running as smoothly as it might, they don't detract too badly from the underlying feel-good factor that the film tries to convey.  That said, whilst most of the screenplay is gentle, things do at times take an uncomfortable turn, in a way that some of the cast seemed unable to really handle, resulting in a certain degree of over-playing the drama's main crisis points. I wondered at times how some scenes had made it through the editing phase. There seem to have been some odd casting decisions made at times, too, with some of the cast wasted in their roles (most notably Mary Lynn Rajskub in a role that amounts to little more than a bit part), while others such as Nick Offerman (Frank) seem out of their depth in major parts.  Happily, the principals -- Nick Robinson (Joe), Gabriel Basso (Patrick), Moises Arias (Biaggio) and love interest, Erin Moriarty (Kelly), are all excellent.

In summary, then, although it offers something of a bumpy roller-coaster ride, often straying from the believable and constantly over-stating things to some extent, the film is nevertheless entertaining pretty much throughout. While much of the dialogue may limp along, the visuals are often stunning; all in all, well worth a watch.",1380931200,,1865,5.006451612903226
5695699,5,B00C7BZZ32,Moises Arias' character alone makes this movie worthwhile. One of the funniest characters and performances I've seen in a while.,1380844800,41,128,5.45
5695700,4,B00C7BZZ32,"I am definitely not going to say I disliked this movie, but I was surprised at all of the 5 star ratings it received. As soon as it was over, I didn't really think ""Oh my gosh, that was a great movie!"" I had more of a ""meh"" feeling.

However, it seems that the more I think about the story and explain it to other people who are curious about watching it, I have grown an interesting love for it. I think it speaks to people because we were all teens once and understand the angst these boys feel. They just want to be independent, but like every adult now understands, being independent and taking care of yourself isn't always a happy go lucky experience.

In conclusion, yes, I would recommend watching this movie. Go into it realizing that it is kind of slow; even the most exciting scenes have a laid back feel to them (just my opinion). You just may have the same feeling as I did afterward, but let the story sink in a little bit and you will probably want to watch it again.",1380672000,,982,4.218085106382978

5695702,4,B00C7BZZ32,"There are moments where it's difficult to pinpoint just what kind of film KINGS OF SUMMER wants to be. The heart of the plot is dramatic: several young boys, annoyed with their families, run away from home to be independent only to find their goals thwarted by a painfully formulaic love triangle. However, the cast is weighted with heavy comedic talent (everyone from Nick Offerman to Hannibal Burress makes an appearance, including a few lesser known names from multiple sketch shows and comedy troops). There's a whole lot of silliness going on, especially in the character of Bellagio (that's probably not how you spell his name; he's one of our runaways, the weirdest and least grounded in reality of the three boys), which makes the movie feel like it's going for a nonsensical level of humor. The two halves aren't so bad, but mixed together, they tend to come across as uneven.

In spite of the fairly predictable plot points, the movie's glut of musical montages, and its occasional leaps of logic (three boys -- by all accounts unskilled in shop class -- manage to build a house in the woods in what appears to be two days), the movie is warmhearted and just nutty and tender enough to avoid backsliding into pure nonsense (either of the dramatic or humorous variety). While it's not nearly the coming of age tale it is marketing itself to be, it's definitely entertaining as long as you put a fair-sized chunk of your disbelief aside and focus most of your attention on the film's continuous stabs at goofiness. Beautifully filmed as it may be, the real reward of script lies in the laughs, as opposed to the over-done family ""lesson"" at the film's tootsie sweet heart.",1380499200,3,1680,4.7534246575342465

5695704,1,B00C7BZZ32,"I cannot believe the good reviews this got everywhere else. It's a terrible, dumb movie.

The kids run away from home, and build an entire house, start fires, bang drums, invite friends and are still invisible to the thousands of people searching for them (they're on the news and the police are involved).  Not to mention, their hideaway is walking distance from their house. They also make many visits to a Boston Market and a golf course near their campsite.

Also, their lives aren't that bad for them to run away.  The comparisons to 'Stand by me' must stop!  Not in the same league, and there's no reason for comparison.

The kids are self obsessed, selfish and have a pretty good life in their houses.  The dad lets the kid shower 50 minutes before he gets mad and asks that the kid wears underwear in the house. How terrible is that?  The dad seemed pretty cool to me.

Of course, the ending is predictable.",1380326400,7,915,4.530487804878049

The find a place in the middle of the woods and build their own house. The two of them along with a young boy who they are afraid to tell to go away start off on a experience that effects each one differently. This is an example of a movie where the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. This is an excellent and must see movie for all teenagers for a few reasons. One is because it shows that their parents aren't as bad as they seem compared to these. I could go on and on about this but the best way to describe this is a Stand By Me for a new generation. This is is movie that just needs to be seen rather then read about. Also the kid that plays Biaggio really steals the movie and is so much fun to watch.
