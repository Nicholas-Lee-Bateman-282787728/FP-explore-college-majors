8593781,4,B00DJAF5BM,"Well after reading other reviews for this Italian version of The Amazing Colossal Man. I decided to order this off the Italian amazon site...If you are looking for this on DVD look no further...This is the version you have been looking for.
Aside from the Italian title cards and the Italian newspaper headline this is the same movie..The quality was very good and I don't think it will be improved upon till this gets an american release ( probably only MOD) if were lucky..there are
removable Ital. subtitles and it has both english and italian audio tracks...stay away form the ""other"" Italian release of this and stick with the Pulp Video release and you won't be sorry...The ""other"" release is purported to be off the VHS tape from a previous release....The Pulp video release is a professional transfer...",1390780800,3,811,4.884057971014493
