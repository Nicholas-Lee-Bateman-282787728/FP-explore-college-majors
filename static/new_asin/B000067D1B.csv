1713798,5,B000067D1B,"I bought this video after reading various reviews about it both in Yoga Journal and on Amazon as well.
 For the sake of background, I've been a dedicated daily yoga practitioner for over 5 years and have over 40 videos (along with weekly lessons with a wonderful teacher) and was curious to see Rod Stryker's approach to yoga. I've read several articles by him and and about his deep background in Yoga. I'm really pleased with what he presents in this video.
 This video is unique in many ways. First, Rod Stryker moves at a much more relaxed pace than many videos which makes it much easier to follow. For most (if not all) of the poses he starts with preparatory movements that move you gently into and out of each pose before you hold them for an extended time. This really lets your body ""warm"" into the pose and acclimate to the movement before holding it. This is a really beautiful part of the approach taken here (many of Yoga Zone's videos do this to a certain extent as well and I wouldn't be surprised if that's a result of Mani and Alan Finger's influence on him (Alan Finger is the founder of Yoga Zone and Mani was his Father).
 Anyway, this is a very thorough, well executed session that has lots of attention to the internal aspects of yoga practice. It also contains a long relaxation segment which then moves into a seated meditation segment.
 Also, you can do either the first 30 minutes of the tape and stop if you are short on time or you can continue on for the full hour to be able to get into a deeper, more thorough practice.
 I highly recommend this video to those looking for a gentle but very thorough Yoga practice. I don't know if you'll end up living longer but you'll sure feel better each day of the life that you do have.
 Namaste.",1039219200,35,1766,4.385321100917431
1713799,5,B000067D1B,I agree with what Kathy had to say about this video. I'm a Yoga Instructor and really appreciate Rod's articulation in this video. I highly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in yoga for improving their health and wellbeing.,1033344000,4,236,4.780487804878049
1713800,5,B000067D1B,"I am a major fan of Rodney Yee's yoga tapes and Rod Stryker's measures up to the master!  This video gives you a great workout, meditative and restorative breaks, and breath training.  This tape has the most positive effect on mind and mood of any tape I have.  It takes approximately an hour to do the entire routine, but there is a convenient break point if you have less time.  This tape has really caused me to appreciate the beauty of the movements, the peace to be found in even brief periods of meditation, and the joy of breathing and living. Stryker has an assistant who demonstrates modified forms of the poses.  Watch the whole tape through once before starting because it is just slightly different than most, and Stryker does not always use the names of the poses in the manner to which I have become accustomed.  It is not, however, difficult to catch on to his directions.",1031270400,14,887,4.547169811320755
1713811,5,B000067D1B,"This is a wonderful video workout for anyone just starting a yoga workout and for those who are in deep need of de-stressing. Rod's voiceover is soothing, calm, and tells you what you are going to do BEFORE you are actually supposed to be doing it. I loved that. This means never getting behind and feeling like you have to catch up. He has gentle reminders to breathe and to relax areas of the body where you unconsciously might hold tension during the poses. As a massage therapist I have a fair amount of self-body awareness but his reminders found me a few times holding unneeded tension as I was concentrating on getting into a pose. Hurray for those reminders to relax!! I also love that there is a second person on screen at all times doing the easier variations of the poses. The visual reinforcement of actually seeing the variation (as opposed to having it described to you by the instructor while in the full pose) cannot be underestimated!! Highly, highly recommend!",1244505600,,978,4.658959537572255
1713812,3,B000067D1B,"This really is an excellent routine and Rod Stryker is a great instructor, HOWEVER, Gaiam is selling the same routine under 2 different names and different packaging. So, if you have bought the longevity workout and see peak performance in a store, don't buy it! Also, the back of the DVD claims that Rod Stryker is the only student of Mani Finger's to receive yogiraj status, but I know Alan Finger (Mani's son) received that status well before Rod. I know because I received my certification under Alan. The routine itself gets 5 stars, but the shady marketing takes away from that.",1190937600,20,584,4.735294117647059
1713813,4,B000067D1B,"After the initial confusion of the class (I ordered this dvd and received one called ""Peak Performance"", and then realized that it was indeed ""Yoga for Longevity"" after all!- renamed), I really enjoyed the class.

Rod has a very calming voice and gives wonderful instruction.  The music was very fitting and relaxing, and the background was beautiful.  It was very professionally done.

Although I am more flexable, it was great that he had another person, Ingrid, to demonstrate the same poses in a modified way for those less flexible.  He also provided a shorter version of the class, and a longer version.  For those who had a limited amount of time for the class, they could stop the dvd 1/2 through after the first mini-relaxation.  For those who had more time, they would continue through the mini-relaxation into more poses, relaxation and meditation.

Rod also included some poses in the longer version of the class, that aren't as often used in the average yoga class, which was refreshing.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the poses seemed a bit rushed toward the end of the longer class.  I had to keep pausing the dvd, to really sink into the poses, and feel what was going on inside.  I am a believer in holding the poses to get the full benefit and integrate the mind with the body.  But other than that, it was great.

The sitting meditation at the end was also great - very relaxing, relaxing music, he talked a little in the beginning to guide the student, and then there was just silence (with the music).",1179619200,4,1543,4.587591240875913
1713814,5,B000067D1B,This is an excellent video. Rod Stryker does a beautiful job of combining the mental and physical aspects of yoga in this presentation. The scenery is beautiful without being obtrusive or overdone. The assistant who does easier versions of the poses is a big plus for beginners or those with health issues. I am a physician who treats mainly spinal disc herniations. After inital treatment  with chiropractic and physical therapy I would strongly reccommend this video to my patients as well as others who are seeking a nonsurgical alternative.,1170633600,2,544,5.112359550561798
1713815,4,B000067D1B,"Dr. Beth Cholette wrote a great review. The only thing I can add in on the menu, you can either do the main workout which is 1 hour, or choose the 1st or 2nd half only, or you can choose to have the camera focus only on Ingrid doing the modified version. It's just an angle change option even during the workout. If you don't do the meditation, the actual movement part of the workout is 43 min.
Dr. Beth did a great job listing all the poses & you can see by how few for 60 min, you can estimate that he slowly moves in/out of each pose & does it 2x half-way before actually doing it. He holds it an moderate nice 40 seconds each when done fully. The pace of the actual movement is nice & slow & could have been good, but I got a bit bored since Rod doesn't talk much or have that many inspiring words, or tell you the benefits of each pose to keep you going.
Rod Stryker who speaks very calmly & slowly narrates as a voice over. The music is very light, barely hitting your consciousness, very light, no deep beat which I need. The camera work & production quality is great of course since this is GAIAM.
The thing that bothered me the most & main reason I give it 1 less star is I didn't feel the poses flowed with one another, it felt a little like gym stretching, with just getting into basic standing usually in between which I personally don't like. I don't feel he has as much body awareness or peace doing yoga as Rodney Yee, Seane Corn, Shiva Rea, Wai Lana, Teigh McDonough, Yoga for S*x, etc. though he has more then most of the new people or aerobic instructors jumping on the yoga bandwagon. *Cough* Kathy Smith *cough*

You can see a preview at Gaiam",1156464000,2,1664,4.167701863354037
1713816,5,B000067D1B,"I usually do yoga with Rodney Yee's videos - which I absolutely love, but I wanted to try a video by a different instructor. I wanted something gentle and slow, and Rod delivers!!!

I find this DVD so soothing and gentle, his voice and detailed explanations on how to do each pose is excellent. I am learning to relax more and feel the poses more now.

I love this workout!",1151712000,,373,4.314285714285714
1713817,5,B000067D1B,"The breakdowns of what's on this dvd don't do it justice - you have to actually do the whole routine to know how good it feels!

Rod Stryker is an adept yoga master who's also an expert at meditation and breathing techniques.  He has the best relaxation CDs which aren't available at Amazon but you can get them on his website.  This dvd is a great starting point for those unfamiliar with Rod Stryker.  He designed the routine so anyone can do it, including newbies.  But it is so utterly relaxing, even long time practitioners of yoga would find it soothing as well.  Postures included are designed to release tension in the areas of the body where we commonly hold most of our tension.  But in the end, it's not just your body that feels lighter, but your mind and spirit.  This yoga routine is pure bliss.

Rod is a true yoga master, not your average run of the mill yoga instructor who just took a course.  He's done this for years and the difference shows.  His manner is relaxed and unobtrusive.  He's there to guide you but lets you go deep within.  A truly unforgetable yoga experience and I only wish I'd discovered him years ago!",1131148800,10,1140,4.449275362318841
1713818,5,B000067D1B,"When I first tried this video, I didn't know what to expect; my only previous experience with Rod Stryker was in the Kathy Smith yoga series, which I did not like.  But to my pleasant surprise, I found that Rod teaches in a relaxed, easy-going style that was a perfect fit for me.  The DVD actually contains two practices, each just under 30 minutes, that can be performed either separately or combined for a longer practice (this format as well as the general feel of the practice is very similar to Kripalu Yoga Gentle).  Rod and a student, Ingrid, perform the practice in a pretty mountaintop field area overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  Rod instructs via voiceover, and Ingrid frequently displays modifications of the poses.  In general, Rod performs several flowing repetitions of each posture followed by a longer hold, which gave the practice a viniyoga feel to me.

The first practice, which is about 28 minutes long, begins in a reclined position with a focus on breathing.  Some simple stretches follow, including knee-to-chest, revolved stomach pose, cat/cow, and a kneeling shoulder stretch.  Rod continues with a few more stretches in a standing position:  standing forward bend, arm circles, and a neck stretch.  He then moves into a standing pose series, returning to mountain pose for stabililty between each standing posture.  The poses consisted of triangle, warrior 1, a wide-legged down dog/standing forward bend combination, and modified revolved triangle.  He then returns to the floor for additional cat/cow stretches, down dog, a rest in child pose, and then final relaxation.  During the relaxation, which lasts for several minutes, Rod asks you to meditate on the number 12 and then slowly count backward, with each number bringing you closer to perfection.

You can either stop your practice at this point or continue with the second practice, which flows right into bridge pose.  Next, he moves into a lying face-down position for some back extension work and then back to a reclined position for hand-to-foot pose, lying twist, and reclined bound angle.  Transitioning to a seated postion, you'll perform a seated forward bend, bound angle, and then move into relaxation pose.  This time, Rod asks you to visualize various parts of your body smiling, eventually moving to imagining your entire body smiling; I found these visualizations to be beneficial.  The relaxation again lasts for several minutes, and then the final six minutes of this practice is devoted to pranayama (breathing) and seated meditation.  From a seated position, you will first perform a variation on alternate nostril breathing and then spend several minutes just sitting quietly, bringing the total time for the second practice in at about 26.5 minutes.

Options on the DVD include selecting chapters, choosing to perform the practice from the modified perspective, and an interview/biography of Rod.  I enjoyed Rod's gentle teaching style, and even though I was already very familiar with all of the poses included in this video, I found his alignment reminders to be helpful.  All of the postures on this DVD would be accessible to beginners (although prior familiarity with the poses would be helpful), but I think that all levels of yoga practitioners will find something to like in this soothing, relaxing practice.",1129334400,29,3322,5.1471135940409685
1713819,5,B000067D1B,"I use this DVD when I want to really unwind and relax. I have some Ashtanga and Vinyasana dvd's and this is totally different. It focuses much more on meditation, which is great when you're in the mood for that. I feel like I am totally able to let go and dump all the negative energy and (...) I am carrying around after doing this.

If you have a bad back, you might want to be careful with the spinal twists. They left me hurting a little bit the next day, but this is a problem area for me.",1108857600,3,494,3.98989898989899
1713820,4,B000067D1B,"This very relaxing video is an excellent hour or half-hour yoga workout.  Easy on the body, yet energizing. As a man, I enjoy yoga videos that feature men.

7962524,5,B000067D1B,"I bought this yoga workout years ago in VHS format.  It was my first yoga experience, and I still work out to it.  It is truly for beginners unlike some yoga workouts that are labeled for beginners but are much harder.  I like to work out with Rod and his modifier when I haven't worked out regularly, when I've got a cold and don't have a ton of energy, when I'm sore from other routines, or when I'm too tired for a harder routine.  I'd highly recommend this for yoga newbies or those who want a refreshing, easy yoga workout.  This is the same workout that used to be called ""Yoga Journal's Peak Performance Yoga"" from 2003.  The old cover had Rod Stryker in blue exercise shorts doing Warrior II on the beach.",1438732800,,713,4.323308270676692
7962525,5,B000067D1B,"I've always liked Rod Stryker. His voice is very masculine instead of the typical soothing voice that
can be a bit annoying to me.  I like this video because Rod has a partner who goes a bit slower.  I used
to practice yoga religiously, Bikhram was my favorite.  But I've been badly injured and so it's nice
to have this to try and complete, not at Rod's pace, but at his partner's pace.  A bit frustrating for
someone that used to be quite adept at yoga, but it's a good way to get back into it.
It's a great workout if you follow Rod.",1433808000,,536,4.125
7962526,5,B000067D1B,"Rod Stryker's ""Yoga for Longevity"" remains my favorite yoga video. I wish he had done more. It is an excellent overall body yoga workout. It has a wonderful meditation with alternate nostril breathing that is relaxing and insightful. I appreciate Stryker's use of the term ""pure presence"" which allows you to choose the higher power of your choice should you desire.

The workouts are constructed so you can do 1/2 the workout or all of it. Each has a relaxation segment. He has another yogi, Ingrid, demonstrating the modified (easier poses) for beginners.

Beware, ""Peak Performance"" is the same workout just in different packaging. I had to return it when I discovered it was a duplicate.",1413936000,,691,4.948275862068965
7962527,5,B000067D1B,"This is the best yoga tapes I have.
It is easy with few down dog positions.
There is an assistant that modifies the poses.
Great for beginners or experiences people.
Also, he has a very soothing voice and talks through most of  the tape,
which helps with understanding the pose and the body.

Very relaxing and rejuvenating.",1411776000,,324,4.666666666666667
7962528,5,B000067D1B,This is the second Rod Stryker yoga program I have purchased and I really love it. This one gives me a choice of the more difficult or the modified poses which really helps as I am older and not so flexible as I used to be.  He is quiet and easy to listen to. I get a good work out and feel relaxed when I am done.  I would recommend this DVD.,1343001600,,343,3.75
