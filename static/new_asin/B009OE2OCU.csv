5358579,1,B009OE2OCU,"Well ive been waiting for the complete season 1 to come out and finally here it is.  It has nothing to do with season 1 at all, its a tv movie that happened to be at the last or second to last season. So save your money (which by the way is not to bad) and don't buy the complete first season on DVD. Im a big heat of the night fan and i hope it gets worked out and they release the true complete first season cause it is good.",1360540800,8,427,3.6923076923076925

5358653,5,B009OE2OCU,"Got  this  season  on  DVD  last  week.  Quality's  good.  Watch  these  guys  as  they  take  on  massive  cases  &  investigate  any  possible  crime  or  criminal  activity  that  may  occur  in  the  town  of  Sparta  Mississippi.  These are  tense  moments  here  in  the  first  season  where  some  of  the  officers  get  riled,  Some  of  their  situations  are  frustrating.  If  a  friend  is  in  great  danger  they  are  eager  for  it  to  come  to  an  end.  But  Bill  Gillespie  (Carol O Connor)  is  gonna  do  whatever  he  must  to  be  smart  &  not  let  one  of  his  boys  get  on  the  loose  end.  You  know  that's  what  I  love  about  him.  The  ending  of  some  of  the  episodes  isn't  always  what  you  expect  to  see  on  some  of  these  seasons.  The  bad  guys  though  always  lose  in  the  end.  &  everyone's  stress  over  the  investigation  they're  facing  is  over.  Something  strange  is  always  happening  in  Sparta.",1473206400,,972,4.3441558441558445

5358659,4,B009OE2OCU,I loved this series and looked forward to seeing it over and over again; then I found out about missing episodes in subsequent seasons probably due to excess greed with music rights etc. The thing that really bothers me is the failure to inform the buyer of these omissions; the reason I will not be purchasing any future releases. It is a sad state of affairs in our country when greed rules everything and what's really foolish is the holdouts will get nothing for their avarice.,1459209600,2,481,4.604651162790698

I was just about to shell out bucks to purchase all 8 seasons but then I read the descriptions. So many episodes not included, why even bother! If the people behind the DVD releases are too cheap to shell out for the rights (I'm guessing music?), then I'm too cheap to buy!

5358772,2,B009OE2OCU,"This is another favorite old show I like to watch, except I'm not real happy about having to pay good money just to get half of the shows on DVD. Is this another way to con people out of their money or is this the new way the DVD companies and the producer's will be doing their DVD business from now on. Who wants to pay good money for half of the shows missing?? I sure don't. I'm not happy about that but I still love the show. No way do I blame Amazon for this. The blame goes to the producer's of this great show and to the one's that are making the DVD's of this show for even agreeing to produce a DVD of a TV series with half of the shows missing. If I had it all to do over again I wouldn't of bought one season of this show until they can get all the shows on there.",1414454400,,776,3.7962962962962963

5358779,1,B009OE2OCU,"The label was incorrect!!!!!  While it did give some good shows, one of the which was from the first season, but just by the characters alone the other films were other seasons.

I will not buy any more of Heat of the Night as they have too many problems; when problems are solved and what is advertised matches what is ACTUALLY in the box, e-mail me.

I am tired of returning",1401408000,15,376,4.267605633802817
5358800,5,B009OE2OCU,"Even though the package on the DVD indicated that this was the Complete Season One of Heat of the Night ...that isn't the case.  Due to some copyright issues ...a few of the episodes for Season one was not included ...so for a two-parter story line - you'd only get the first episode but wouldn't know the ending of the second episode because that would be the one that had copyright issues.

That being said ...I always loved the series.  It brought back thoughts of a happier time and simpler time when we would rush home - so as not to miss an episode of this tv program.  I loved seeing the clothes of the times and the sense of honor in the character of Chief Gallispie and of course, the series would be what it was if it wasn't for Virgil and Bubba (who I had a big crush on - and still kinda of do).  While not really complete as the packaging says - it's still great to have it as part of my DVD collection.

I think it would be more helpful if there was a disclaimer on the box saying that some of the episodes are missing due to copywrite law/issues ...this way people don't fee cheated.  True fans know when a season's series isn't complete ...we do remember the episodes we watch - after all.

Of course - this didn't stop me from buying the complete eight seasons ...with TV at it's lowest point today - it's great to kick back and pop in Heat of the Night episode.",1400457600,26,1379,4.196969696969697

5358802,5,B009OE2OCU,Good series...enlightens us to the world of the South in the late 80's.  Carroll O'Connor is always including humor if you listen closely.,1398643200,2,138,5.0
5358803,3,B009OE2OCU,"I wrote down the different individual shows off Wikipedia, and there are 26 different shows that do not appear on the different seasons.  Is this a tactic to get us to buy the ""lost"" shows?  other series have not done this, some give you part 1 and part 2, but do not leave you hanging when an episode is shown and the following show with a different name is not included.  I am very disappointed. ""Heat"" was one of my favorite shows.",1396742400,12,434,4.2682926829268295
