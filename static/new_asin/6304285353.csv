824067,5,6304285353,"Bottom line, whether you love or hate ""Kansas City"" will depend on your reaction to Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance. Leigh's character Blondie anchors the story as a desperate wife trying to save her husband from the gangsters he tried to rob. Leigh looks great in this role, she is fit and trim which makes her face that much cuter. The contrast between her almost angelic appearance and her tough persona is intentional because the toughness is an affectation, qualities she has adopted because she loves her husband and they are a turn-on for him.

Her's is the key performance of the film, the twist is her emulation of Kansas City native Jean Harlow (""The Public Enemy"" and ""Girl from Missoui""). Watch Harlow in ""Red Headed Woman"" to see the incredible physical resemblance between these two short actresses.  Personally I found it touching, humorous, and inspirational.  But it is almost a caricature and many are put off by this tiny woman talking so tough.

As in ""Nashville"", there are great songs (but jazz rather than country) throughout the film. It is important to realize that ""Blondie's"" behavior is intended to mirror the ""cutting contests"" between the jazz musicians on-stage at the club. Just as the musicians borrow from one another and weave each others stuff into what they are improvising, ""Blondie"" borrows from the movies and weaves Harlow's tough girl phrases and expressions into her conversation.

Leigh and Miranda Richardson spend most of the film in each other's company. Although Richardson's character is doped up on laudanum (tincture of opium) most of the time, you get the idea that she is taking in a lot more of the situation than she is letting on. It is a fascinating pairing.  One of them has lost all restraint, the other has lost everything but her restraint.  There is almost a ""Thelma and Louise"" quality to their relationship, in part because Leigh doing Harlow ends up sounding a lot like Geena Davis doing Geena Davis.

Richardson's character is unexpectedly touching. An emotional bond is subtly forged between the two women as the film proceeds, with Richarson actually becoming protective of her kidnapper. The ending is shocking but you understand the motivation (or you will if you watch it again), then looking back you pick up on the various foreshadowing devices that Altman placed throughout the film. He goes out with a bass duet of Duke Ellington's ""Solitude"" performed by Ron Carter and Christian McBride.

Like many films with downbeat endings, ""Kansas City"" is destined to be more appreciated 25 years after its release.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1114646400,20,2632,4.972665148063781
824068,1,6304285353,"There are the makings of a good movie here, but obviously Altman had final cut approval, and his gift was quite off on this one. Belefonte endlessly pontificates nonsensibly, Jason Leigh surpasses her legendary how-annoying-can-she-get Hudsucker Proxy performance, it's long, the jazz performances just make the film drag.

Such a shame - beautifully shot, great actors, shame about the director's inability to look in the mirror and notice the obvious bloat. A dreadful, annoying film.",1111881600,3,486,5.48
824069,5,6304285353,"Robert Altman, one of the foremost filmakers of the last thirty years followed up what many consider to be his magnum, ""Short Cuts"", with this quietly more ambitious project.  ""Short Cuts"" finished 'place' at the Oscars to ""Shindler's List"" and helped spawn the career of Juliana Moore (sort of like Sissy Spacek in Welcome To L.A.) although I personally liked virtually all the other performances better (and there are some great ones in it).
The release of ""Kansas City"" followed hard upon the heals of the Oscar 'second best', and met with 'mediocre' to 'ok' critical reviews. Thus, the film didn't have much of a run in the theatres, playing to sparsely filled houses, who basically came to see the novelty of Harry Belafonte playing a rip-snorting gangster in an Altman film.  Nor was the DVD release much of a hit.
What kept the movie alive basically was the magnificent soundtrack - a group of the best of the new generation of jazz musicians playing Kansas City jazz - well - as well as Count Basie and that guy who invented the jazz saxophone (what was his name?) - oh yeah, Coleman Hawkins, themselves.  The CD became a classic, and a few people discovered that Altman had fostered this long time love for Kansas City jazz, and now that he was a bigshot and could finally raise lots of money to make any film he wanted, he decided to act on his long time dream to recreate the Kansas City Jazz scene in the early thirties in a movie.
And what an incredible recreation it is!  There is even a separate one + hour film which Altman made of simply the bands (as recreated by the contemporary musicians playing all the tracks in the film and on the CD and more, and nothing else!)  This film evokes an amazing, dreamlike experience and ranks with any performance of twentieth century music currently on DVD, and I wish they would release it when they release the director's cut, which I predict they will (my 30 year track record is pretty good).
Simply put, ""Kansas City"" is a noir masterpiece.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an incredibly complex, brilliant performance and which is only to be matched by her foil  .  One of the great ""two chick"" flicks of all time, one wonders why Altman seems to be the only director who sees Leigh for what she is: the best American actress of her generation.  Belafonte and the rest of the cast are up to the searing standards demanded by these lead performances, and the script and the almost superhuman attention to detail evidenced in the sets, editing, and every frame, make one wonder what exactly the critics had in mind when they watched this film for the first time.
But the music . . . the bands themselves take on a certain personification and become characters participating in the action of the story.
I believe ""Kansas City"" is due for a re-evaluation and may go down as the greatest venture of both Leigh and Altman, and that's saying a lot.",1078704000,10,2898,4.5899419729206965
824070,1,6304285353,"I rented this movie because I like period stories, especially those that take place in the 1920s and 1930s. This movie was about as dim-witted as its main character Blondie. The story was hard to follow because it made little sense, the diaglog really dull,and the movie moved at a snail's pace. And what was with the pregnant black girl? What purpose did that serve and how did it fit into the story?

824071,3,6304285353,"If it were not for Harry Bellefonte this one would fall apart. Harry definately held it together as the only acting bright spot.

824072,4,6304285353,"The reason I adore this movie is because of the accuracy of the recreation. Everything matches with what a jazz lover knows about Kansas City at that time: the characters named in the movie - up to Bennie Moten's  (died in 1935, leader of the orchestra Count Basie took over) surgeon,  Charlie Parker's mother, Lester Young, Hawkins (somewhat less); the  characters seen and mentioned, such as Tom Prendergast (the ganster who got  Truman a start), John Lazzia etc; and characters just seen but not  mentioned, such as the lady playing piano  - Geri Allen, who looks like  Mary Lou Williams -, the singing bartender patterned after Big Joe  Turner.
Then there is the music which is just great, a successful  recreation of ancient jazz, which can be heard in ""Robert Altman's  Jazz '34"" and purchased separately in two CD's, ""Kansas  City"" (the original soundtrack) and ""Kansas City After  Dark"", all three available ar Amazon and reviewed.
On the positive  side for the movie I'll mention the great interpretation by Harry Belafonte  and Miranda Richardson (Mrs. Stilton), less so of Jennifer Jason Leigh.
I think the weak side is the plot: Blondie (Leigh) abducts Mrs. Stilton  to get back his man, who is in custody of the black gangasters (Belafonte)  for a hold-up. Then Blondie goes on talking and talking with a somewhat  annoying and exaggerated pitch.
I conjecture Altman wanted to make a  movie on his home town in the moment of maximum musical blossing and jazz  development and he gave less importance to plot and characters, more to the  music. I think we can be happy with that, but as a jazz lover I prefer the  above-mentioned ""Jazz '34"".",957830400,16,1653,4.832142857142857
824073,2,6304285353,"The shooting and action is high quality and typical altman, but you never grab onto the characters. Too much happens too fast, like a great jump blues tune, but as a film it's a bit out of control.

824186,5,6304285353,"Noir and jazz: what more could you ask?  Everyone who sees this film recognizes that its greatness is in the music, but some think the acting is weak.  I disagree.  I think Jennifer Jason Leigh as 'Blondie' is a great performance, a mad woman's infatuation with a ne'er-do-well carried to the extreme, and Miranda Richardson's upper class doped-up kidnap victim is without peer.  This is just a fine motion picture and you will want to watch it several times, which is the only reason to by a disk in the first place.",1435708800,,517,4.586956521739131

824189,5,6304285353,"""Kansas City"" is an audacious undertaking by anyone's standards but director Robert Altman is more than up to the task.  Altman in previous endeavors juggled multiple storylines with large ensembles to convey a story successfully and this film is no exception. Altman touches upon issues like race, class, and politics that are as relevant today as they were in the time the film is set.  The story here is Depression era Kansas City in all its glitz, grandeur, and vice.  From the political wards run by the corrupt Prendergast Democratic machine to the inner city world dominated by the larger-than-life gangland kingpin Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte) and points in-between Altman creates a portrait of a town ready to explode usually in the hale of gunfire accompanied by some of the smoothest jazz riffs ever to grace the silver screen.  The heart of the film concerns Blondie O'Hara (Jennifer Jason-Leigh), a Western Union worker whose husband Johnny (Dermot Mulroney) had the misfortune to get caught robbing one of Seldom Seen's high rollers.  In desperation Blondie kidnaps at gunpoint Caroline Stilton (Miranda Richardson) in hopes that her husband, an aide to President Roosevelt, can broker Johnny's safe release.  From this storyline blossoms the complimenting threads that make up Kansas City the town and the movie.  The performances are terrific from Jason-Leigh's toughtalking Blondie, Richardson's opium dazed Mrs. Stilton, and last but not least Belafonte's.  Belafonte's presence looms large over the proceedings that the other actors have to step back and watch him work his magic.  Jason-Leigh has a trickier role because she has to walk the tightrope of the comic, dramatic, and pathetic and largely succeeds.  Richardson manages to engender sympathy for a character that on paper could have been derided.  The ending, though shocking, makes sense when you consider the narrative that precedes it.  Sparing no expense the period look of the film is dazzling from the art direction, cars, and wardrobe.  I'm not a big fan of jazz but the music on hand here, arranged by Hal Willner, provides the film an indescribable rhythm acting as an additional character.  Even Seldom Seen has to interrupt his important business to savor the riffs happening in the other room.  This is the film ""The Cotton Club"" could have been thirty years ago but wasn't.  The film reminded me a lot of ""Nashville"" in the sense that with a few intertwining stories Altman tells a tale of a big city at a certain place in time.  If ever there was a film that was overdue for reevaluation ""Kansas City"" is the one.",1420934400,4,2607,5.03962703962704

824191,3,6304285353,"Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a kidnapper who abducts the wife of a powerful politician, and uses her captive as a bargaining chip to try to free her lover (well-played by Dermont Mulroney) from the clutches of a local crime boss (Harry Belafonte), who has been keeping the young man on ice ever since he attempted to rob the nefarious bigwig.

I understand why people regard Robert Altman as a genius, and one of the greatest American filmmakers of all-time, but I just can't bring myself to like most of his movies. The exception to this rule would probably be ""Brewster McCloud"" which is one of my favorites. The overlapping dialogue, the disjointed pacing, the loose, improvisational feel of the narrative (which I've heard is many times tightly scripted, despite its seemingly offhand nature)- none of it really works for me. I certainly can't fault Altman for taking this approach, especially with a film that makes jazz music such a cornerstone of its overall appeal.

That said, here's what's undeniably good about the movie: Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is pitch-perfect. As in ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" (a rare misfire for the Coen brothers), she has this sort of ""Girl Friday"" tough talking character vernacular down to a science. She is sexy and tough in equal doses. Harry Belafonte is also wonderful as a coke-addled crime boss who holds court in a smokey jazz bar that seems as if it was lifted directly from the Harlem Renaissance and planted squarely on Kansas soil. I should also add as a postscript that the period details also feel spot-on, the mis-en-scene very much reminiscent of ""Miller's Crossing"" in its attention to detail.",1404864000,6,1649,4.949458483754513

824264,5,6304285353,"I had seen Kansas City in the late 90's. it left me completely cold at the time. I thought, in tandem with a lot of critics in those days, its central plot involving the kidnapping of a political honcho's wife by a lower class Jean Harlow wannabe, completely trite & inconsequential.  I should have known the beauty of an Altman film doesn't reveal its mysteries until you immerse yourself in its world through multiple viewings. A recent acquisition of the 2005 DVD took me completely aback, and I found myself spellbound by its impressionistic account of what it might be like if we could take a time machine back to 1934 in the prosperous transcontinental hub of Kansas City during the Depression, which largely left this corner of the heartland alone. Altman returns to the city of his birth and recreates the musical excitement of the black jazz clubs he frequented as a young man, but this is hardly a nostalgic portrait. By the time it closes, we have a complete account of the entire culture, politics, and socioeconomic and race relationships of an era. On his commentary (apparently recorded around '04 because he references the Criterion release of 3 Women, and he relates some of the same stories like the impact of David Lean's Brief Encounter), Altman can hardly contain his exuberance for the film. He says that he really dug into the core of the material, and repeat viewings bear this out. Altman intended it to be ""filmed jazz""  with a superficially bland plot that could have been a Jean Harlow or Joan Crawford melodrama in that era, but it takes off into wildly complex directions and character revelation through improvisations that mirror the improvised riffs of the jazz musicians of the Hey Hey Club.

The film is related to his earlier 70's master work Thieves Like Us. They take place at roughly the same time, but Thieves dazzled by immersing the viewer in the slow rhythms of a rain-drenched Mississippi summer, whereas in Kansas City the spirit of the city itself seems to be embodied in its legendary jazz scene from that era. A critique of popular culture in shaping the lives of people is explored in both these films also: the bank robbers in Thieves want to live up to antihero legends as presented on radio programs just as Blondie in Kansas City models her speech patterns and tough gal exterior on the Jean Harlow melodramas she has assiduously memorized through repeat viewings. She boasts of having seen ""Hold Your Man"" (and we're treated to a clip of that film) six times and takes great offense when the
woman she's kidnapped gives her assessment of Harlow as cheap, brassy, and low class.

The performances of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Miranda Richardson are exceptionally good. I had just seen Leigh in her performance in Alan Rudolph's Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle right before Kansas City, and you'd hardly tell it was the same actress, so thoroughly does Leigh immerse herself in the role of Blondie. Miranda Richardson pairs up with her nicely as the kidnapped wife of a politico who is quite prepared to deal with the indignities  of a kidnapping as long as shes got her trusty laudanum vial by her  side. The two demonstrate acutely observed black comedy in their scenes together, and a touching bond begins to develop between the two so that the final scene, shocking upon first viewing, makes perfect sense in context of these characters. Also, as ruthless gangster Seldom Seen, Harry Belafonte's performance garnered the most attention upon the film's initial release. Belafonte's transformation into this brutal but pragmatic gangster has its own peculiar grace and is also darkly humorous, as in his joke about a genie he tells when his bullyboys are murdering one of his employees who has double-crossed him. He airs his political views ( some insightful, some ludicrous) and he seems particularly opinionated on the subject of Marcus Garvey's back-to-Africa movement of that era. I was also impressed with A.C. Tony Smith as Sheepshan Red and was surprised he hasn't done more acting work as he fills out this flamboyant gambler beautifully and with great comic presence in what is essentially a small role, but Smith makes it memorable.

The hullabaloo of the plot is mirrored in the film's thrilling recreation of a ""Battle of Jazz"" that is taking place at Seldom Seen's Hey-Hey Club throughout the duration of the narrative's timeframe. The jazz world brimmed with excitement when word began to spread of Altman's intention to get the best jazz greats of the 90s to stage more or less a musical battle that could have taken place in the era of Count Basie, Bennie Moten,  and Coleman Hawkins. The results are awe-inspiring (and Im not even much of a fan of jazz), and the soundtrack and its sister album ""Kansas City After Dark"" became modern jazz classics that became probably better known than the actual film, more or less buried by its releasing company. It is hoped any future Blu Ray releases of Kansas City will include the doc ""Robert Altman's Jazz '34"" containing the full filmed footage of the musicians performing in the Hey Hey Club. It is hoped Criterion will recognize and honor this film and its euphoric musical performances for being latter-day classics.

To an Altman fanatic like myself, the rediscovery of this film has been like finding a buried treasure, a gift from Altman from beyond the grave. Future generations,I am willing to predict, will probably place it among the director's highest achievements. This was the last film Altman made before his health deteriorated to such an extent he had to get a heart transplant. Preexisting conditions notwithstanding, I like to think poetically that Altman invested so much of his energy and artistry on this picture that he almost died making it.",1366588800,5,5781,4.878818737270875

She really should have thanked the gangsters for taking her husband then used the opportunity to get a real life, but she fashions herself and him as Bonnie and Clyde wannabes.

The movie uses Kansas City blues music to transition from scene to scene, which is very well played, but adds little but annoyance to the progress of the film.

Yet, at the same time, music lovers see the battle going on between the somewhat bluesier, aggressive playing of the giant Coleman Hawkins contrasted clearly with his major rival Lester Young, the more sweeter melancholy player..These 2 contrasting visions play-out throughout the entire movie not only as a backdrop as a soundtrack but a portrayal of the contradictory lives played by it's characters.

There is no difference between the Downtown KC of crime, brothels and booze(opium and cocaine as well) with it's underworld in contrast to the Americana of the Uptown KC with it's quaint Democratic lifestyle untouched by the jazz going down at the Hey-Hey Club...ultimately leading to murder from all sides.

On the surface, this movie's approach isn't much different from Altman's others--there's constant activity, so much that it's initially disorienting to try and figure out all of the threads of the story, but in many of his films (NASHVILLE, MASH and GOSFORD PARK, for instance), those threads gradually come together into a whole.
