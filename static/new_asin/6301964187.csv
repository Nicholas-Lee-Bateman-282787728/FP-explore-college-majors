385512,3,6301964187,"William Powell and Myrna Loy return as Nick and Nora Charles, this time with a baby to help keep the dog company.  The mystery is a rather complicated one, with the couple's quiet weekend in the country disrupted by the murder of her business manager at the hands of what appears to be a blackmailer.  But things are never what they seem, and several murders later, Nick reveals all.
Powell and Loy continue to be a perfect match, with such a breezy, comfortable chemistry.  They effortlessly toss off lines laced with dry humour.  The supporting cast is good, featuring a funny Marjorie Main as a landlady, a slick Sheldon Leonard as the man threatening the victim, and an underused Ruth Hussey as a mysterious nanny.  There are a lot of other familiar faces as well.
I found the story a bit confusing in the beginning and would have liked the ""cute"" scenes with the baby reduced.  But the plot keeps the viewer guessing and I did enjoy Nick's wrapping up of the murders.  Although not a great film, it's a very solid mystery that fans will enjoy.",1054339200,2,1048,4.572192513368984
385513,4,6301964187,"In ANOTHER THIN MAN Nick, Nora and their baby son are invited to spend a weekend at the home of a wealthy weapons manufacturer. Two murders occur and Nick solves them both with the clumsy aid of Lieutenant Guild, a character who was also in THE THIN MAN. One of the victims seems to be able to predict future events but unfortunately not his own death.
William Powell and Myna Loy are supported again by a fine cast which includes C. Aubrey Smith, Otto Kruger, Nat Pendleton, Virginia Grey, Ruth Hussey and Sheldon Leonard. Hunt Stromberg is the producer and W.S. Van Dyke is the director. The movie is based on an original story by Dashiell Hammett.",1051660800,,650,4.564102564102564
385514,4,6301964187,"In this third of the wonderful Thin Man series, Nick and Nora are joined by their baby, Nick Jr. It is totally jarring to see the sophisticated duo, Nick's cocktails et al., trying to go goo-goo at the same time. (Nick has taken to calling Nora Mommy!) But...So what. Baby or not, this movie is just a gem, and it sports one of the all-time lines, tossed off as only Myrna Loy could: When asked how their cross-country trip has been, she replies, ""Nick was sober in Kansas City!""
The plot is always secondary to the incomparable byplay between Powell and Loy, but the mystery is entertaining nevertheless. Just back from their trip, Nick and Nora are urgently summoned by Colonel MacFay, who fears for his life. Gathering up Asta and baby, the couple repairs to the colonel's country estate, where the mysterious goings-on are nonstop. The plot, as they say, thickens, and indeed, a murder does occur. A very young Sheldon Leonard plays Phil Church, a small-time hood who seems to be the villain of the piece.
The baby's birthday party, while completely at odds with the normal tone of the Thin Man movies, still has its moments, as other reviewers have mentioned. The one-liners are delivered without a bat of the eye, which ultimately saves the movie from too much in the way of family values.
This is not my favorite Thin Man movie, but it remains a worthy addition to anybody's collection of vintage, ""they-just-don't-make-them-like-that-anymore"" films.",1028764800,3,1457,4.855421686746988
385515,4,6301964187,"As with the previous Thin Man movies, sophisticated humor prevails in this murder mystery.  The chemistry of William Powell and Myrna Loy is the stuff of screen legends.  Nick and Nora's repartee and rapier wit keeps the film fresh and entertaining, albeit 60+ years later.  That's the good news.  The other news is the baby, Nick, Jr.  A baby diminished the adult tone of the series.  Inevitably, wholesome family values clutters up the script with a superfluous baby party and other cute little high jinks.  From a purist's perspective, this film is a step down.  Babies notwithstanding, the nightclub segment that shows Nora's attempt at sleuthing is a high point of the plot.  Contrast her fumbling search for Dum-Dum with Nick's smooth manner of gleaning information.  When the cops interrogate Nora about Colonel MacFay's murder, note her reaction as they divulge information about Nick's old girl friends.  A strong supporting cast is present, as usual.  Marjorie Main has a small but hilarious part as a busybody landlady.  Sheldon Leonard is menacing as tough-guy Phil Church, the apparent villain.  C. Aubrey Smith is nervously bombastic as Colonel MacFay.  Doodles Weaver shows up in a bit part, and zings Nick by calling him a ""pool parlor dude.""  Note Nick's reaction to this crack.  Shemp Howard arrives at the baby party with a kid.  When queried about his marital status, Shemp replies, ""Nobody said you had to be married!  They just said you had to have a kid!""  Put it all together, it adds up to fun for fans of classic comedy.  ;-)",1019088000,,1551,4.888461538461539
385516,4,6301964187,"Although MGM continued to soften the characters of Nick and Norah Charles from the sharp-edged original (in this particular film the couple has a baby and Nora is described as no longer drinking), Powell and Loy retain their sparkle as a team and the script offers plenty of opportunity for them to shine.
This particular film concerns Norah's financial manager, well played by C. Aubrey Smith at his most crusty, who is being threatened by a former business associate--and no sooner is Nick on the case than murder results. As in the previous ""Thin Man"" films, ANOTHER THIN MAN sports a remarkable cast: in addition to C. Aubrey Smith, there are extremely enjoyable performances from Marjorie Main, Ruth Hussey, Muriel Hutchison, Sheldon Leonard, and Abner Biberman. Every one is sure to enjoy the fun, particularly when Nora takes a hand by investigating a nightclub and both Nick and Nora meet Marjorie Main's ""Mrs. Dolley.""

The film begins in Manhattan. The trunks for the Charles' family arrive with special care. There is an important long distance call from Long Island. Colonel McFay has a problem. The Charles will enjoy a weekend in the country. On the road Nick sees something in the road; but it disappeared! Is this just a threat? There are comic skits in this drama, and subtle humor. A dead dog is a threat. Who is doing this? Is the threatening man leaving the country? There is a shot in the night. They call the Sheriff. Why is there a murder wherever Nick Charles goes?

There are various events while Nick Charles investigates with the police. Nick visits a night club. Two men follow him. Nora is there with a message. There is a fight, the lights go out. Nick learns something. [These scenes are played for laughs.] At the end everyone is gathered in a room and Nick Charles solves the murder by figuring out how the murder was staged. There is a shocking surprise when Nick reveals the murderer. [Do you find it believable?]

Nick consumes his weight in gin, but it's an ongoing theme through the series.

385791,5,6301964187,"The third installment of the Thin Man series is one of the best and for me second only to the first. Though the second film, After the Thin Man is good I felt it got a little too seriously involved in the crime story and downplayed the humor a bit. Here the repartee between Nick and Nora is as sparkling as ever and the scenes at the Cuban club and Marjorie Main's apartment building are absolutely hilarious. The mysterious killer is virtually impossible to fathom, but who cares when you're having so much fun.

All the ingredients that made the first two so good are present here. It was directed by W.S.Van Dyke and the screenplay is again by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett who knew just how to develop the right tone and keep things moving. As usual Powell and Loy are surrounded by a skilled supporting cast including the formidable C.Aubrey Smith as the old business partner of Nora's father and Virginia Grey as his daughter. A nice detail is bringing back college and Olympic wrestling champion Nat Pendleton as Police Lieutenant Guild from the first film. Marjorie Main is outrageously funny in the role of an apartment manager.

As usual there are lots of potential motives and persons of interest, all of them giving their best guilty and shifty-eyed faces when necessary. This time around the suspects mostly just happen to be together for nick's final interrogation and summary of the evidence scene and don't have to be rounded up by the police. The killer is not at all obvious and any one of them could have done it. There is an odd trick involved in the actual killing which I'm not sure at all would actually work but within the confines of the story it's acceptable enough.

They are invited-or rather pushed into- visiting the country home of McFay, an elderly industrialist who had been a close friend and business partner of Nora's late father. But this isn't a social visit; McFay has received harassment and death threats from a former employee named Church, an engineer who had spent time in prison, presumably as a fall guy for when a crooked scheme of McFay's went awry. Church has been demanding money after his release, but McFay stubbornly refuses to pay him anything. McFay is murdered, and the local authorities descend upon the estate and interrogate everyone, including McFay's relatives and house staff, and even Nick himself. Of course Church is the obvious suspect, but what is really going on?

Some of the usual banter and drinking, but overall less humor and more convolution than before. Jokes such as the baby party where everyone brings babies fall flat, and there is less fun in this outing than in prior ones. Nor is there an emotional impact to make up for it.

386284,4,6301964187,"This 3rd in the series still has the comedic chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles.  They are as fun as ever, but this time around the story seems a bit overdone with too many characters.  Predictability is also becoming an issue.  I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea.  I still loved the movie.  There's a new Charles in this film also.  Sure Asta (the dog) is still a prominent character, but a new baby has arrived.  Nick, Jr., just shy of his 1st birthday to be celebrated back in New York.

Nick and Nora have been summoned to meet with Col. MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith) at his Long Island estate.  MacFay had been in business with Nora's late father which made both men very rich.  Evidently, MacFay had some shady dealings with a crook, Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard), who was sent `up the river' for a few years.  Church feels that MacFay owes him restitution and has been threatening him, his family and associates.  A couple of ensuing murders brings in the police and the district attorney (Otto Kruger).  Clues lead the police and the Charles back and forth between Manhattan and Long Island.  An ever expanding cast of characters, and potential suspects, adds to the fun.

Leave it to Nick, to snoop around balancing his detective skills with his shot glass (always full).  W. S. Van Dyke is back in the director's saddle and stirs up a nice blend of misinformation to keep us guessing who the real culprit is.

386340,3,6301964187,"The following paragraphs are taken from a recent review of the Dashiell Hammettss crime detection novel The Thin Man which the original source for the successful series of films starring William Powell, Myrna Loy and Asta, including the film under review, Another Thin Man.

Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles (and wife Nora), Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective. Hammett, on the way to creating these literary works of art did journeyman's work at the detective genre in various pulp detective magazines. Moreover, in the beginning he hid his detectives behind the anonymous, although not faceless or without personality, average detectives of a national detective agency, the Continental Op series(shades of his own past). One of those efforts is an early almost totally unrelated version of The Thin Man that those who have read the later version (or know Nick, Nora and Asta only from the film series) would not recognize.

Dashiell Hammett is perhaps better known for creating the classic modern proto-typical detective, one Sam Spade the detective-hero (or anti-hero, if you prefer) of the literary (and film) noir The Maltese Falcon. With The Thin Man he took a different tack in providing a model detective- the urbane Nick Charles, his side-kick society wife, Nora, and their ever present faithful dog companion, Asta.

The story line here centers on solving the apparently perfect murder of Noras estates financial manager, a little rich girls financial manager (if a rather nice little girl and by the time of this film a mother too).There is an elaborate, too elaborate attempt, to make the deed seem to the work of a disgruntled former employee who took the fall when the investigators saw the books were cooked. An excellent reason to seek revenge, especially after doing a dimes worth in stir. But as with all such thing that was just a diversion. As usual Nick and Nora followed the dough, or rather who would benefit most from the financial managers demise. Thats why Nick and Nora get the big bucks, or the kudos.",1398470400,,2462,5.029411764705882

386458,4,6301964187,"Another Thin Man is one hour and forty - two minutes and was released in theaters November 17, 1939. The story line picks up roughly two years After The Thin Man leaves off. The Charles now has a son, Nicky Jr. The Charles are in New York and is invited to Long Island by Colonel Burr MacFay. The Colonel really wants to tap into Nick's talent as a Private Detective because someone is threatening his life. Later that evening, when everyone has retired to bed, Colonel Burr MacFay is killed. The police are called in and everyone is questioned. Nick tells Assistant District Attorney Van Slack that he is taking his family back to New York City because he has had a knife thrown at him and his family threatens and that this is Van Slack's case and will have nothing to do with it. Some how Nick finds a way to get himself involve with the case. Unlike the last two Thin Man movies, this one did not have the element of surprise. It is like the writers could not think of a decent ending for who did the killing. Notable stars in this movie are Virginia Grey, Otto Kruger, and look for Shemp Howard (Three Stooges fame) as Wacky who ""rents a baby"" to bring to Nicky Junior birthday which is mainly attended by ex cons who were sent up the river by Nick Charles. Another Thin Man gets a B+ for lack of a decent ending.

386464,3,6301964187,"With a murder mystery comedy, there's always a judgment call on how serious the underlying plot should be, and how much comedy should be involved. With Nick and Nora having a baby (Nick, Junior), the mix on this one tilts more toward comedy. Yes, there really is a mystery, a couple of murders and swindlers galore, but the clues are almost buried in rather broad, almost slapstick humor. It does not have the sophisticated veneer of the first two films.

An old guy who was Nora's father's partner is in charge of her estate, and insists she and Nick come down to the country to visit him when they'd only just gotten back to New York. He's been spooked by a Cuban guy who used to work for him who says he's dreamed of the old guy's death twice. He also says this has happened to him before, and the third time he has such a dream, the subject really dies. Of course the old guy takes this as a threat on his life.

Three guesses who ends up dead before we go much further.

That's only the beginning, of course. Before it's over, there's more murder, mayhem, lies, plots, and general confusion. There is also the obligatory nightclub scene with a chance for a pair of amazing dancers to show their stuff. The man especially seems more like a skater than a dancer. If you figure out how he did those moves, let me know.

And then there's the boithday party for little Nicky. That, however riotous, is actually part of the plot and not merely a chance to show a whole bunch of adorable babies.",1336694400,,1493,4.379061371841155

386520,4,6301964187,"We once again join ace crime-solving couple Nick and Nora Charles in their third big-screen adventure, ANOTHER THIN MAN (1939).  Whilst it doesn't exactly reach the dizzy heights of sophistication like the first two ""Thin Man"" entries, it's never dull when the Charles clan are on the screen.

When Nick and Nora (William Powell and Myrna Loy) are invited to the Long Island estate of Colonel MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith), an old business associate of Nora's father, they gather up Asta and little Nicky Jr. for what they assume will be a rather dull weekend of Nick fixing the accounts.  But naturally, the Charleses always run into the most intriguing murder mysteries, and the MacFay case turns out to be a real doozy!

Once again furnished with a solid supporting cast and a lively Frances Goodrich/Albert Hackett screenplay (the recipe of success for a memorable ""Thin Man"" film), ANOTHER THIN MAN is a joy, and only slightly below-par of the first two movies.  Ruth Hussey (""The Philadelphia Story"") co-stars as Nicky Jr.'s shifty new nanny; with Virginia Grey, Otto Kruger, Nat Pendleton, Patric Knowles, Marjorie Main and Muriel Hutchison leading the supporting cast.

386523,5,6301964187,"Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) are back in New York with their almost one year old son.  They haven't even had a chance to unpack when they are invited, summoned really, to the Long Island estate of Colonel MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith).  MacFay was the partner of Nora's late father and still manages her estate.

When they arrive, they discover that MacFay is convinced he is about to be murdered.  He's been receiving threats from Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard), an ex employee who blames MacFay for the decade he spent in jail.  With all kinds of weird things happening around the estate, Nick is inclined to take the threat seriously.  Unfortunately, the colonel is indeed killed, and Phil vanishes.  Did he do it?  What's really going on?

This is the third in the series, but I think it is the strongest to date.  The plot was good and kept me going until the logical end.  While all the suspects were together at the end, it wasn't a pre-arranged cliche like in the first two films.  Nick and Nora are still great characters, and their banter is as strong as ever.  And the entire cast does a good job.  Plus they didn't all look the same to me, so I could tell them apart and follow the story better.  While the baby does have much to do, he is cute in his scenes.  And Astra, the dog, has several funny bits.

I really can see why these films are still watched and referenced today.  They are fun with good stories.  I recommend all three that I've seen so far.",1220918400,,1487,4.400735294117647
386524,5,6301964187,Fun to watch! The toddler is perfect! It was refreshing seeing the Terrior Asta doing actual flips instead of computer generated action. An old black and white movie perfect for family enjoyment.,1199577600,,195,5.125
386525,5,6301964187,"The Thin Man series spanned years and each production was charming and witty fun for the moviegoing public. Dashiell Hammet's Nick and Nora were perfectly portrayed by William Powell and Myrna Loy, and this third entry, like the others, is a breezy and fun comedy mystery done with style, class and top drawer production values from MGM at it's zenith.

In this one, little Nicky Jr. is a year old and proud parents Nick and Nora are having a ball. Nick is trying to get out of going to Long Island because Colonel McFay (C. Aubrey Smith) only wants him to go over financial reports and other mundane matters that might interfere with Nick's drinking. But there is also a threat on the Colonel's life and Nora wants a quiet weekend in the country, so off they go. It turns out anything but quiet, of course, and Nick has to solve another murder.

A sharp and clever script with snappy dialog keep this one moving along nicely. Pretty Virginia Grey is the Colonel's daughter Lois and Ruth Hussey plays little Nicky's nurse, Dorothy. Lois wants to marry Dudley Horn (Patrick Knowles), much to the chagrin of the Colonel and his secratery, Freddie (Tom Neal), who is in love with the lovely Lois as well. It seems some of the Colonel's business dealings have been just a little on the shady side since the death of Nora's father, his business partner. Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard) may have been on the wrong end of one of these shady deals and with all this going on you can guess what happens next.

The interplay between Nick and Nora about their quiet little weekend is a lot of fun. A body in the road and a pool house fire get things moving quickly in this light and breezy entry in the series. Nat Pendelton is along as Lt. Guild this time and Marjorie Main has a nice turn as a very funny landlady. Muriel Hutchison also has a nice role as Church's girlfriend, Smitty, in a mystery a little more complicated than you might think.

This time the gathering of suspects, including Don Costello as Diamond Back Vogel, takes place at a birthday party for Nicky Jr. thrown by Nick's old pals. Shemp Howard has a funny role as Whacky, as does Harry Bellaver as Creeps. Otto Kruger is on hand as A.D.A. Van Slack when Nick surprises everyone with the killer's identity.

One of the highlights in a film with many fine moments is a scene at The West Indies Club. Nora learns a little more about Nick's past there than he would like! This is a fun film to watch, and there is a magic here which can never be duplicated. This is five star entertainment you don't want to miss.",1180051200,3,2570,4.471215351812367
386526,4,6301964187,"The third installment in the ""Thin Man"" series, ""Another Thin Man"" (1939) was the last episode to which writer Dashiell Hammett would contribute. Hammett provided the story; Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett reunited for the screenplay -also for the last time; and W. S. Van Dyke returned to direct William Powell and Myrna Loy as comic detective duo Nick and Nora Charles. ""Another Thin Man"" finds the Charleses back East again with a nearly one-year-old son, Nick Jr. and dog Asta in tow. Just as they arrive in New York, Colonel MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith), who had been Nora's father's business partner, insists that Nick and Nora visit his Long Island estate on a matter of some urgency. MacFay is being shaken down and harassed by former employee Phil Church (Sheldon Leonard), whom MacFay believes means to kill him. Ever the reluctant detective, Nick is compelled to take the case on when MacFay's fears become reality.

""Another Thin Man"" isn't as witty or charming as 1934's ""The Thin Man"", but very few films since then have been. William Powell and Myrna Loy still have great chemistry and comic timing -although I find it grating when Nick calls his wife ""Mommy"". As usual, the murder case is chaos and the solution strained. But this is pretty good light entertainment. Nick and Nora's quiet weekend in the country turns hectic immediately, and when the possibilities there have been exhausted, the mele moves to the city. Police Lieutenant Guild (Nat Pendleton), whom you will remember from the original ""Thin Man"" film, is back, though he has left his hard-boiled persona behind. He's bit of a bumbling fool now. The entire police investigation is played for laughs and made out to be ridiculously incompetent. It's funny, but it's not Dashiell Hammett's style. The sordid family affairs beneath a veneer of wealth and respectability, on the other hand, are very much Hammett's style.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): The film has only a few minor flaws, but it is not perfect. A short film and a cartoon are included as bonus features, so you can watch the film the way audiences saw it in theaters in 1939. ""Love on Tap"" (10 min) features ""The Abbott Dancers"", a women's dance troupe, and concerns their overly dedicated chaperone, who always puts the dancers' needs before her fianc, much to his frustration. It's a silly film designed mainly to showcase the ladies' acrobatic dancing. ""The Bookworm"" (8 min) is a cartoon about storybook characters who decide that they need a worm to complete their witch's brew, so they set off to find one in another storybook. They find a bookworm, of course, who proves difficult to catch. There is also a theatrical trailer for ""Another Thin Man"" (2  min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French.",1142380800,8,2815,4.89727463312369
386527,3,6301964187,"I've always liked ANOTHER THIN MAN.  I never quite understood what made it different than the other THIN MAN FILMS until I read some of the other reviews listed here and at other sites.  I guess it, as some have described, is darker film or perhaps grittier would be a better word.  Anyway, the next three THIN MAN sequels all followed a very basic formula.  All that changes were the names and faces but the people were all the same.  Those three films were, in my opinion, targeted at the current fans.  No doubt the fan base was large and guaranteed a good return at the box office.  However, the love bickering that went on between Nick and Nora was no longer fresh.  The plots all followed the same formula and even Asta the dog was no longer as amusing as he first was.  In general all the other sequels followed the time old Hollywood tradition of redressing the same old story to lure fans back to the theater and wring some more money out of them.
ANOTHER THIN MAN did seem to leave some of the overt comedy behind and focused on plot a little bit more.  I didn't notice as big a change in the formulas as others have but it is clear that VanDyke was trying to approach the film from a different angle.  As this was only the second sequel to the original THIN MAN the view, if he/she watches all six films in the order they were made, may not notice some of characteristic plot devices.  More than anything else I think this is the last THIN MAN film that showed Nick and Nora's playful bickering and loving digs at each other and it still seemed believable to the viewers.  By the fourth film it no longer seemed genuine or practical.  Instead of falling into the dull married routine in later films Nick and Nora still playfully feel each other out and take pleasure in pushing each others buttons.  To me this didn't seem that realistic for an old married couple but it was still fresh in ANOTHER THIN MAN.
This film should appeal to all THIN MAN fans as well as the more casual viewer.  If this is the first film you've seen of the THIN MAN movies I suggest watching THE THIN MAN and AFTER THE THIN MAN before watching any of the other THIN MAN films.

7817816,5,6301964187,"The first movie in this series was based on a book with the same name as the movie ""The thin Man"" Which referred to the murder victim, not the detective.

This movie instead of just basing it on the same story or making something up to keep the characters going is based on another writing from Dashiell Hammett. ""The Farewell Murder"" (1930) written as a part of a short story series ""The Continental Op (Vintage Crime)"". The promotional title of this movie is ""Return of the Thin Man.""

Nick (William Powell) and Nora (Myrna Loy) are invited to visit an old partner of Nora's father. He is Col. MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith) and he is being threatened, more like blackmailed. You guessed it. Despite all precautions the Col. is a dead chicken.
Who did it?

Aside from all the standard creepy suspects, now the Nick and Nora have a little one to add to some of the comic relief and even suspense.",1508371200,,891,4.487654320987654
