2470412,1,B000CR7R6G,"As a self-prolaimed horror junkie, I'll be the first to admit that it doesn't have to be big budget to be entertaining, but alas, the only redeeming quality of The Dawn is the cover photo. I was one of the poor unfortunate souls who purchased this moronic, mindless excuse for a movie. It has no plot, the dialogue is painful to sit through, it wasn't worth the few dollars I paid for it used. In fact, it's not even worth a rental fee. Do yourself a favor and run as far away as you can from this ""movie"".",1207958400,2,506,4.173469387755102
2470413,1,B000CR7R6G,"The barrel this scraping came from was clearly a lot deeper than the pockets of the people who made this wretched effort. Incoherent and badly scripted, acted and directed, this is a real triumph for incompetence. The loud, intrusive soundtrack, somewhere between latin and hip hop I suppose, does nothing but grate and, although I'm no prognosticator, I can't see any future for anyone involved in this sorry project.
Worse yet, the title doesn't even feature in the film. What precious little energy the film has is long spent by the time we get to twilight. Don't rent it, borrow it, buy it, steal it or think about it.",1194048000,4,622,4.715596330275229
2470414,1,B000CR7R6G,"This movie, if not number one on my list, is definately top five material for the worst movie I have ever seen.  I can't tell you what it was about.  This was just a convoluted mess.  I've been in a few low budget movies, and just because a film is done on a low budget doesn't mean it has to be incoherent.  I would almost bet that half the actors, and I use that term loosely, in this film probably could not tell you what the plot line was here.  Don't rent it.  Don't borrow it!  Don't watch it on a dare and for the love of god, don't buy it!  It won't even make a good coaster for your coffee cup.",1165449600,3,603,3.8852459016393444
2470415,1,B000CR7R6G,"Where do I start? First, it was a low budget movie. Not that there is anything wrong with low budget but, usually they turn out to be pretty bad. Secondly, it takes a good half hour or more before anything starts to happen. The hip hop sound track didn't help it much either. I would definitely rent it before buying it. Don't waste your money.",1162684800,7,344,4.3076923076923075
8100879,2,B000CR7R6G,"I feel that the basic premise could have been quite good.. however... it was not told well at all. Most of the acting was steriotypical and rather boring, they spent too much time ""building"" the characters and not nearly enough time killing them off.. or showing it. There are too many questions at the end of this one, most importantly... can I have that hour and a half of my life back?",1520294400,,388,4.402777777777778
8100880,1,B000CR7R6G,I've watched a ton of bad movies and can usually find something worthwhile in most. Not this one. Completely useless and a waste of time.,1517270400,,137,4.52

8100882,1,B000CR7R6G,I saw it for free at a friends house. Well some of it. and frankly I want my money back it stunk that bad.,1508371200,,106,3.4583333333333335
8100883,1,B000CR7R6G,"This movie should have been called overacting screaming chicks in the woods. Nothing about this movie makes sense and  every character is dumb. I think this may have been a an ego project to feature the ""actors"" rap work, but even the soundtrack is garbage. I got nothing",1508025600,2,271,4.645833333333333
8100884,4,B000CR7R6G,Not sure why  all of the bad reviews.  AS far as low budget... well it was  far from some of the low budgets I  have watched so  nothing there. I though it was  pretty good. Didn't have the end figured out 10 minutes in  like  I do most of the time.  I think it was  an hour and  half well spent.,1506816000,,296,3.6885245901639343
8100885,3,B000CR7R6G,I liked this story..Im a bit of a scaredy cat  when it comes to voodoo crap..good movie.,1504137600,,88,4.176470588235294
8100886,1,B000CR7R6G,OMG!  A horrible movie.  I am a fan of Vincent Piazza (who is in the firm) but I couldn't take any more than 20 minutes of this movie.,1441152000,3,134,3.75
8100887,1,B000CR7R6G,"Save the box from this film for a movie you taped off TV on DVD. Then toss the paper and the DVD which came with the Box in the trash can .  I accept a low budget film can have bad acting, bad sets. [actually the sets were OK], but there must be a decent plot [or some plot]. The plot was just plain non existant. It moved slow, and never went anywhere. What were they thinking when they made this. The film actually was some what professionaly filmed[ editing, camera work etc.], too for a low budget feature. It is just a shame they had no real script. I agree with another reviewer, it is one of the worst. Anyway I just tossed out my copy. I still have the box it came with , as I said though.",1279584000,3,697,3.9785714285714286
8100888,3,B000CR7R6G,"I really don't think that the muvie was the best, the music really didn't go with what was going on, but in overall I would rent it if I don't have other options to pick from.
