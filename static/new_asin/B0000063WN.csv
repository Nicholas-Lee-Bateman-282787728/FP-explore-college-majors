7903605,4,B0000063WN,"Fun and sexy romp about 3 gal-pals who develop and run a catering wagon. Put together better than most T&A B-films. Some cliches and social double standards throw in for good measure. James, and his dad, Dick Van Patton ( Eight is Enough, High Anxiety) have small roles. Also a standout is the progressive pop-band Missing Persons who is featured a lot in the film Terry Bozzio went on to drum with Frank Zappa, wife Dale is a hottie ( and has several dialog scenes on top of her singing) Other supporting cast members may be familiar to you as some of them have long resumes of character actors. Rose Marie (The Dick Van Dyke Show) makes a pivotal appearance. Ok, now to the main characters. They're all super hot, great bods, and the characters they play are clean, honest, and ambitious. This is not a conventional ""T& A"" flick as there isn't any sleaze, our girls aren't sluts. This doesn't mean they don't ""get down"" but they're selective. One of the things I found most amusing is our trio seemingly only wear bras when they're in their apartment, they will hang out in their undies together, but when its public outfits, they decide to leave those behind. Sadly, ""pokies"" and ""jiggling"" are kept more at bay than you'd think in a film of this nature, and there is VERY little sustained nudity (for those of you scouting vintage sexploitation flix) The fashion sense for the women seems more disco-era 70's than 80's.  Fun little flick, worth watching with your S/O on coach potato night. I wrote this review here because IMDB does not list it.",1405641600,,1550,4.615942028985507

7903608,5,B0000063WN,"I remember seeing ""Lunch Wagon"" in the '80s and always enjoyed the light atmosphere of this cinematic masterpiece :o)  Kept holding off buying this movie, figuring that it may be released on DVD someday...this was years ago. Recently found an excellent, lightly used VHS of this rare out-of-print movie, so I went for it.  The plot consists of 2 girlfriends who team up with their bodybuilding gal pal to operate a catering truck, but quickly find they are not just slinging hot dogs in their new career quest.  It's a fun, not raunchy storyline.  2 Playboy centerfolds and an appearance from Missing Persons-an '80s Pop band (New Wave back then), all adds a nice glimpse into early '80s Pop culture.  Unfortunately, this rare '80s movie is not available on DVD. However, the Media Home Entertainment VHS release looks A1, better than some of the DVDs that I've seen in recent years.  Picture is clear & vibrant.  Sounds great too.  It's a 35mm film transfer, so there are reel change prompts...the dot that appears on the upper-right side of the screen every 15-20mins. Along with this, there is some film crackle-All of this combined adds another dimension to the viewing experience of this this enjoyable early '80s Drive-In Classic.  If you like obscure movies that mostly played at Drive-Ins like I do, then you are going to really enjoy this blast from the '80s past.",1345939200,2,1373,4.833333333333333
