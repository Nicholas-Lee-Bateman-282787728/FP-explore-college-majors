8507002,5,B006ZL1PSE,We bought this for a friend's son. They are very careful about what he watches. He enjoyed it and it was clean classic family viewing.,1356912000,,134,4.4
8507003,2,B006ZL1PSE,Movies are very good but the recording is extremely poor. Color is just terrible. I wouldn't recommend this one. Would be better to buy seperate movies of better quality.,1354752000,,170,4.896551724137931
