3515668,5,B001CQONL8,I am so impressed with this series.  It was well worth the money and we can't wait to get the next season and the future seasons.  The best part is watching with no commercials.  The plot can be followed so much better.,1241136000,,219,4.166666666666667
3515669,1,B001CQONL8,"I received this product defective. I contacted the seller for ways to refund the item or get it switched. She (amanda989) told me I had to send it to China, which was not specified in her returns policy. I informed her of that and she told me to send it back to her and she'll even test the next one she gives me. I told her okay, but I wanted one made in the USA and not some cheap copy from China. She sent me her address and never told me what she would be sending back to me. Who wants an opened/tested item when you can get it brand new from amazon? I emailed her 2 more times requesting what she would send me, but she ignored me. I had horrible customer service so I was forced to file a claim through amazon. I wouldn't recommend the seller to anyone.",1238889600,5,759,4.033112582781457

3515671,5,B001CQONL8,"CSI is, and for good reason, one of the highest rated TV shows on, scripted or otherwise. It's basically a Sherlock Holmes type crime drama, with an excellent cast of characters and some truly great episodes and storylines. Truly in eight seasons, there are not many topics this show hasn't dealt with.
I first got into this show through daily reruns. Its amazing to me that this show has stayed as strong as it has through eight seasons. Unfortunately that may be coming to an end, as three of the main characters including Grisham have now left the show. It might be time for the show to end, but I have a feeling they will attempt to keep it going ala ER style as long as it continues to do well in the ratings.",1232150400,,714,4.335820895522388
3515672,5,B001CQONL8,"It's Thursday night; it's almost 8:00 p.m. Lock the doors, take the phone off the hook, disable the door bell, and turn the cell phone off. The show's about to start; ""Who are you, who-who, who-who? Who are you, who-who, who-who? I really want to know, Come on tell who are you, you, you, are you!""
That is the theme song for my favorite show, CSI Las Vegas. I can sit and watch that show for hours on end trying to figure out who killed him, who raped her, or who kidnapped the little boy. I love how they almost always are able to catch the bad guy by using all of their high-tech devices that they have, like the Tecan Freedom EVO 150 liquid handling workstation, which computerizes the removal of DNA or the gas chromatographs which separate mixtures of chemicals so they can tell what the mixture is made of. There are hundreds of gadgets that they use on the show, all of which are real (all of which were either bought or donated to the show by other crime labs across the United States).
The cast, in my opinion, could not have been picked any better. Gil and Greg are two of the best characters in the show. I like Gil because during each episode he continues to show just how smart he actually is. He continuously thinks outside the box to solve the toughest cases, and he really thinks things through before anything ever comes out of his mouth. Greg is my favorite character in CSI because he makes his work fun, especially in the first couple seasons that he was on the show. He is always telling jokes, dancing to his music, or trying to make light of any situation that he is in.
The cast has had almost all of the same people since the first season, and the show has been on the air for eight full seasons; I have seen every one of those episodes while it was on television, and as soon as they came out as a season boxed set, I bought them so I could watch them again. Having them on hand gives me something to do when I am not able to do anything else. For example, I got my wisdom teeth out this summer and the doctor said that I wasn't supposed to do anything for at least a week so I sat on the couch and watched a full season while I was on bed rest.
CSI is the best show on television not only in my view, but in the eyes of millions of viewers across the United States. The show has been ranked in the top five for most watched show in eight of nine seasons; so far this year, it is the most watched show on television. CSI has also won four Emmy's to this date and has been nominated for almost thirty. Very few shows on television even come close to CSI.",1225756800,9,2580,4.162

8288649,5,B001CQONL8,I am a real fan of this show. Was thrilled to find them under my Christmas tree. I have only watched two of the set and I find the quality to be a little poor. Maybe this is the way they they recorded eight years ago. I still would recommend them to hard core fans of William Peterson. He was the man for the show.,1294617600,,314,3.8461538461538463
8288650,5,B001CQONL8,"Yes there are three CSIs, but I've never been able to consider the other two to be much more than ""good"" versus Las Vegas' constant rating of ""great."" I've been waiting for enough seasons to go by to get a decently sized -- and priced -- box set and here it is! I know I'll need to get seasons nine and ten separately later on, but for now, it's my greatest companion on the elliptical - one exercise session per show and so many to look forward to. To show that I'm not just one-show focused, I also keep up with ""Criminal Minds"" and find that to go hand-in-hand with CSI. Now that CSI:Las Vegas is down from $265.00 for six seasons as it was, get ready to lay out much less green for a GREAT product!",1270425600,,702,4.131386861313868
8288651,5,B001CQONL8,I am very happy with the quality of the product. My wife loves the packaging. It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. I would recommend this supplier to others.,1262131200,,164,4.5

8288653,5,B001CQONL8,"If you are a CSI fan like we are, you will want this set. Would only be better if it also included season 9. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas... Well, with this set, you can bring a bit of Vegas home with you!",1256515200,,222,3.74468085106383
8288654,5,B001CQONL8,Best and most addicting show that's on the air today! I can watch this show all day every day and not get tired of watching it ever!,1255219200,,132,3.925925925925926
8288655,5,B001CQONL8,Is there any other words to describe... I love the CSIs series and I love Las Vegas the most :),1252972800,,95,3.8
8288656,5,B001CQONL8,"I am one of those unique people who NEVER watches broadcast TV.  I have NO CABLE, NO SATELLITE, and my old antennae is currently a bird perch on my roof.

I rely completely on DVD COLLECTIONS such as this for our evening entertainment.

NO COMMERCIALS is the reward for our patience in waiting for these collections to be released to the public, and it is well worth it!  We have purchased the complete ensemble of CSI series, including this original, CSI Miami, and CSI New York; and now are awaiting the arrival of NCSI starring Mark Harmon about the U.S. Navy Criminal Investigative Analysis Unit.

So far, this original is the BEST.  William Peterson, of ""Manhunter"" fame [the original Hollywood movie about Serial Killers] is absolutely excellent in his droll, cool, and calculating portrayal of Gil Grissem, the head of the Las Vegas CSI unit.  Marg Helgenberger as his first assistant is delightfully sardonic in her wit, and impressive in her tenacious approach to solving crimes and uprooting the ""Perps.""

Like ALL the CSI shows we have watched so far, the one thing that is laughable is that these crews are always there for the final arrest.  We doubt these CSI guys in real life ever put the cuffs on anyone, but that exaggeration is forgiven to make the shows more concise and exciting.

So far, we have watched Seasons 1 thru 2, and are anxiously awaiting digging into 3 through 8.  The writing is at times too cliche, but more than not rises to excellence when a crime personally touches one of the CSI team members.

An excellent bargain for eight years of a fine Crime genre series, Amazon has done it again for the best entertainment available on DVD's.",1243209600,5,1672,4.707903780068729
