2182573,4,B0006FKL2Q,"An all star team of the best kayakers in the world tackle a portion of the great canyon of the Tsangpo river, in a very remote corner of Tibet. This canyon has been the focus of many legends, and the whitewater pushes the definition of extreme paddling to new limits. The narration could have been a bit better, but the cinematography  is excellent, and I found the film very enjoyable. The setting is truly remarkable, and the film makers have provided a brilliant view from the comfort of our armchairs.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-on-the-Edge-of-an-Endangered-Planet/dp/0964539993/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet</a>",1247270400,,713,6.13
2182574,2,B0006FKL2Q,"A lousy view of possibly the wildest, most beautiful, and most dangerous, remote places on Earth. There is no evidence of passion in this short film, which totally fails to give a sense of people or of place. Viewing the area on Google Earth and reading accounts of people who have tried the gorge are much more enlightening than this overpriced ""little"" video. I, however, do salute the guys for being there though.",1203724800,6,416,4.712328767123288
2182575,3,B0006FKL2Q,"I read about this expedition in Outside Magazine when it happened, but did not fully explore the tale until I stumbled across Peter Heller's ""Hell or High Water"" a year or two later.  While the filmmakers brilliantly capture the awesome fury of the river and the incredible intensity of the kayakers' running it for the first time, it lacks the storyline needed to fully understand the history of the Tsangpo and the complexity of the planning and executing such a trip.

That's where Heller's book comes in handy, even if it provides a far more detailed account of the ground party's trek through the gorge than it does about the kayakers plunge down the river. It is well known that Heller's ambitions were cut short by the expedition leader, Lundgren, who foolishly feared that a bestselling book would steal his thunder and thus kept Heller off the river and at an arm's length from the paddlers.  While Heller has the maturity to discuss this conflict in his book (and agreed to share 10% of his book royalties w/ the kayakers), Lundgren simply omits Heller from the expedition film completely, a move which struck me -- having read the book -- as both petty and arrogant. By sabotaging Heller's efforts, Lundgren effectively chews off his own foot, minimizing what could have proven to be an incredible PR effort for the expedition and this video (case in point, after reading Krakauer's Into Thin Air, I was compelled to purchase Brashear's film Everest, even though the two are not directly related).  Personally, I would never have bought this video had I not read Heller's book.

Tis a shame when egos get in the way of shared success, as was the case in the telling of this tale.  This could have been a great film AND and a great book.  Instead, each is marginalized by the limited success of the other, thus relegating both to sidelines of adventure tales.",1177459200,34,1869,4.7323076923076925
2182576,5,B0006FKL2Q,"As an intermediate paddler, this vid caused my jaw to drop. Stunning scenery. Amazing logistics. Incredible paddlers. Fascinating. I watch it over and over again. Puts the Grand Canyon, Alsek, and Stikine to shame.",1166227200,2,214,5.323529411764706
2182577,5,B0006FKL2Q,"What an incredible journey.  This movie puts all other kayaking accomplishments to shame.  I would recommend first reading the book (Hell or High Water by Peter Heller) about this expedition to fill in the gaps the movie could not possibly fill.  Another great book to read for background on how remote and dangerous this canyon is...The Heart of the World by Ian Baker.  Amazing kayaking, brings a whole new meaning to the words ""big water"" boating.  Take a trip to Tibet and be humbled by the Tsangpo...",1137628800,3,505,4.758620689655173
2182578,4,B0006FKL2Q,Footage was pretty spectacular.  I would recommend reading the book first (Hell or High Water) as it fills in all the gaps in the video.  Great story and big whitewater!,1127260800,4,169,4.6
2182579,5,B0006FKL2Q,"THE SCENERY IS ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING!!  The entire DVD is a ""jaw dropper""  You wouldn't believe their trek through the gorge.  The way the paddlers make their way down the river in their kayaks is unbelievable. When watching this DVD ..NOTE THE WATER LINE!! UNBELIEVABLE!! Recommend highly for anyone interested in this part of the world...JUST BEAUTIFUL!!",1123891200,7,359,5.2631578947368425
2182580,4,B0006FKL2Q,"Into the Tspango Gorge offers the viewer a harrowing look at what it takes to put together and attempt one of the largest supported adventures of the 20th century. Scott Lindgrin, the co-leader of the expedition, is one of 7 of the best big water kayakers in the world. He and his team try to run the previously unrunnable Tspango Gorge in Tibet, supported by 80 porters who have the unenviable task of treking up and down mountains to try to follow where the kayakers went. There's a lot left out, one can tell. But what is there is just amazing. The whitewater sequences are outrageous. The sequence where the porters revolt is terrifying. A must see video for fans of whitewater and expedition travel.",1112140800,14,704,4.64
2182581,4,B0006FKL2Q,"Having read Isabella Bird's book about the Yangtze Gorge (Written in 1898!), this documentary was of interest to me--this river is just as wild, if not wilder, than the Yangtze used to be. Very well-filmed.",1462406400,,206,4.914285714285715
2182582,4,B0006FKL2Q,The main story of the trials of actually getting to the river and gruesome portaging is highly engaging. The added drama of dealing with the porters just adds to the story.,1462233600,,172,4.580645161290323

2182585,3,B0006FKL2Q,"Some really amazing views and peeks into an incredible hidden corner of earth!

What was really lacking for me though was enough information about kayaking and the difficulties presented by the sections of water. There was a spot where the narrator says he ""had a near brush with death"" as we watch the kayaker do a roll or two and carry on. I'm certainly not debating, I'm just saying that here, as in most of the movie, a non-kayaker just isn't given enough information, description or understanding to really appreciate what these guys were doing on the water. Or what the water was doing to them.",1461542400,,600,4.660377358490566

2182595,2,B0006FKL2Q,"I did not think this was very well made.  These guys hiked around a good portion of the gorge, which seemed to be the most difficult part of the journey instead of kayaking.  The other challenging part of the journey was dealing with the discontent of their servents, I mean porters.  I was not impressed too much with this film.",1460937600,,329,4.45

2182604,4,B0006FKL2Q,"Will appeal to Adventurer or Adventurer Wananbee's.  We edited documentary of a first and probably last dissent of maybe the most continuous and powerful river run on the planet.  The logistics of supporting this expedition into here-to-fore unaccessable terrain was perhaps as much a challenge as the river.  Recounts conflict with the porters who extort more pay by striking.  When you see the terrain over which these locals were hauling 70 lbs loads, you may not think so harshly of their actions.  Great filming from vantages difficult to get to.",1455580800,,551,5.0777777777777775

2182628,3,B0006FKL2Q,"I don't usually rate documentaries like I do movies as the production values are usually lower. That is the case with this one. Fuzzy video and interviews with participants who are not actors and endless shots of tiny kayaks in mega white water with little actual tension... of course they are going to make it. Having said that, I watched it until I was thoroughly sated with with all that and if death defying kayaking is your cup of tea, this one has it in spades so go for it.",1412294400,,480,4.344444444444444

2182632,5,B0006FKL2Q,"This is a great film made under difficult (!) circumstances. The Tsangpo gorge is as wild as it gets, both in the water and on the banks.

Luckily, they took me along for the ride.",1403913600,,369,4.36231884057971
2182633,2,B0006FKL2Q,"I saw this on Amazon Prime, and started.  I kept waiting for it to get good.  I finally was about to stop watching, and saw there were only 12 minutes left.  I stuck it out to the credits.  At least it didn't keep getting worse.

Most of the action is from a distance.  I had no empathy for the people in the story lines.  Not the kayakers, not the ground team of professionals, not the local porters.

Meh.  Free except for the time to watch it.  It still seemed like a bad deal.",1401926400,,480,4.064516129032258

2182637,4,B0006FKL2Q,"I'm a sports enthusiast and pride myself on following the extreme sports scene. I was swept away by this movie (no pun intended). I'd never heard of the Tsangpo Gorge nor knew of it's remoteness. It runs along the base of the eastern portion of the Himalayan range in what is considered one of the deepest canyons on earth. That these notable kayakers headed by Scott Lindgren and including Steve Fisher, Mike Abbott, Allen Ellard would attempt to transverse the river is just unbelievable and frankly insane once you appreciate the logistics. The photography is superb and the stories involved make for pure entertainment. I highly recommend this adventure movie to anyone who enjoys sports or travel movies or just amazing entertainment with breathtaking views!",1393372800,,763,5.112
2182638,1,B0006FKL2Q,"The scenery was spectacular, for sure, and this aspect of the movie was quite enjoyable.
Unfortunately, what I saw was the porters taking risks beyond belief for these people, coming up against obstacles that they, nor the kayakers, ever imagined.  The porters these people hired were not professionals, they were farmers, and I can imagine the kayakers ""got them cheap"".  No wonder the porters wanted more money after having to endure life-threatening climbs and traverses with a ton and a half of gear on their backs!  Maybe those kids would have been more respected had they admitted that it was a more demanding excursion than they had anticipated, and actually offered the porters more money for their efforts.
No matter where you travel, who you meet, I feel it goes that ""respect begets respect.""  Hopefully those seven learned a life lesson.
Doubt those kids would have known how to get across that gorge without the porters, either.  The kayakers reminded me of 7 wealthy kids out for an adventure, on the backs of the less fortunate porters who were uninformed enough to agree to being their mules.",1390089600,3,1108,4.903743315508021

It was so interesting, I wanted to see the kayaking trip on the screen and see who the kayakers actually were. The movie was very interesting. It had some beautiful scenery of the Tsangpo Gorge area that was breathtaking. Also, it showed the mighty power of the Tsangpo River. I know from reading the book that the movie was made under very difficult conditions, but part of me wished the movie was a little longer and had more interviews with the kayakers, but all things considered, I thought it was an entertaining and well-made documentary film of an incredibly difficult and impressive expedition to a beautiful and mysterious part of the world.",1517616000,,806,4.683098591549296
