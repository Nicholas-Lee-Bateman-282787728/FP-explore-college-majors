8250861,5,B0013G37VY,"This DVD is packed with excellent footage and news from the Soviet Navy in the 70s with interviews of key people during that time. It is divided in three parts and contains lots of interesting points on the rise of the Soviet Navy from a Western point of view. All of the footage is black and white with the exception of the last part ""The Soviet Navy Today"" which is in color. There are some footage in the DVD that is black and white but I have seen it in color on the internet and other DVDs so I wonder why it isn't in color here but nevertheless it is a nice piece of history to own. Those who studied or enjoy learning about the Soviet Navy during the 70s will find this DVD very valuable to have.",1388620800,,703,4.101449275362318
