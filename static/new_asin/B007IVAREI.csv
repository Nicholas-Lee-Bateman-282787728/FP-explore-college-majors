8518019,5,B007IVAREI,"Mr. Hovind is the best debater I've ever seen. He make these college professor look like idiots. I'm not being biased here. Even the professors start to ""hem and haw"" as he rips apart there stances. I find it funny when these people start crying about Mr. Hovind's  PHD. not being from an accredited school. Before the internet of today - and you did not  want to quit your job - people took correspondence classes by mail. His PHD. is in Theology, anyway , not science. His other degrees are from accredited schools. It's like a 250 pound heavy weight crying "" He's not a real heavy weight!!! He only weighs 150 pounds!!""  After the skinny wimp just whipped you in the ring. The only close debate was the last one.",1444003200,,715,4.442748091603053
