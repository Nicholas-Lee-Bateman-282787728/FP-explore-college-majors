3925247,5,B002GSXKP6,This package is an exceptional deal. You get all four Ocean films for less much less than the price of a single copy of Ocean's 11 on Blu-Ray! What more could you ask for?,1271894400,17,171,4.0588235294117645
3925248,5,B002GSXKP6,"Heck of a deal! 11 was great 12 tanked, but 13 was equally or better than 11. Either way, to own the entire series plus the original ---all in one case---under 15 bucks--- BUTTA!",1269993600,2,178,4.264705882352941
3925249,3,B002GSXKP6,"I loved Ocean's 11, why did they have to ruin it with the other two? was it money? i sure hope not, because in my humble opinion they spent more money making the other two that it wasn't worth it.",1269734400,2,196,3.925
3925250,5,B002GSXKP6,All four movies are included in the set.  It is a fantastically economical way to be able to enjoy all the movies!,1268006400,5,114,4.181818181818182
3925251,5,B002GSXKP6,"Hi, everyone! I had a need to buy all Ocean's from 11 to 13. When I found this great deal, I couldn't resist. Besides all 3 movies that I needed, it had extra one from 60's. I didn't even know that such movie exists. Well, now I got a deal of having 4 movies just in one case for such a low price.
Very recommended!!!",1266883200,5,317,3.8923076923076922

3925296,4,B002GSXKP6,"Review is of DVD collection, not so much the movies. I'm not thrilled that they're all stacked one on top of the other, but the movies played well and looked great without any color issues. I really only needed to replace my Ocean's Thirteen DVD but this set  was more cost effective and the original Ocean's 11 movie is still a bonus even if I'm not crazy about that version. I loved the 2011 remake,  Now I'm looking forward to Ocean's 8  which supposed to star Sandra Bullock as Danny's sister Deborah and sounds good. If you enjoyed Ocean's Eleven at all I recommend this set.",1505088000,,580,4.452830188679245

3925349,2,B002GSXKP6,I was happy to get these movies at a great price BUT they are difficult to watch.  They are so dark that even adjusting my TV settings doesn't make it viewable.

Something interesting about this packaging that I wasn't expecting was that all 4 DVDs are stacked on top of one another in the same holder.  For me, this isn't a big issue because I was taking them out of the packaging and putting them in my DVD holder anyway.  However, if you're planning on keeping them all in this case, just know that keeping them stacked together like that could potentially lead to unwanted scratching.",1483660800,7,557,4.595959595959596

But for the ludicrously cheap price, it is a purchase well worth it.
My biggest complaint with these movies (except for the old original) is that their is all this technological mumbo jumbo going on, and I had a hard time following what was going on through a lot of them. They got overly complicated at times. But then again, I am typically horrible at following movies to begin with.
I do not regret buying this collection whatsoever. Not only because my wife really liked it, but because I could watch these movies again, as there are certainly worse movies out there.",1424217600,,816,4.446666666666666

There is desert where now big casinos stand.  Small motels were attached to the casinos, whereas now casinos are found within high rise hotels.  In the original, the casino is a glorified bar.  The robbery is low tech, commensurate with the times.

There three modern versions keep the same cast and progress in the highly technical robberies.  Each one surpasses the last in suspense.  The collection goes from using a garbage truck to creating an earthquake to perform the robberies.",1391126400,,636,4.878504672897196

The earliest rat pack type flick is certainly showing its age, but still decidedly worth watching.

Of the newer versions my personal preference is for Oceans' 11, which I find has a clear storyline and excellent all round acting with a well executed finale.

Overall I'd rate them as follows, keeping in mind the year they were made.

Ocean's 11 - 1960, ****
Ocean's 11 - 2001, *****
Ocean's 12  ****
Ocean's 13  ****

All the modern movies have excellent acting, good storylines, though I thought the storyline on 13 was of lower quality.
The special effects and film quality were excellent for the most part, among Hollywood's best for the relevant years.

If you enjoy films of this type you will not be dissappointed with this multipack. At the price point I'd have to give it 5 stars for value.",1325116800,4,959,4.700598802395209

3925627,4,B002GSXKP6,"I purchased this combo pack after watching Ocean's Eleven on cable. Four awesome movies. One great deal. The movies come on two double-sided disks and include the original Ocean's Eleven, which I have yet to watch. I have, however, watched the remakes multiple times.

It's rare when a sequel equals or surpasses the quality of a good original but the Ocean's movies somehow manages the impossible. The cast is beautiful (well, at least George Clooney and Brad Pitt), the screenplay is clever, and the action is hot. Great movie that I'll continue to watch again and again.",1302393600,,573,4.907216494845361
3925628,4,B002GSXKP6,"The package is standard for several movies in one case. There are two dvds; one side is one movie, the other side is the other. If you want all of them at a good price, this is the set for you.
The old version of ocean's eleven is quite different, worth watching once, although in my opinion the newer one is better.",1300060800,,316,4.112903225806452
3925629,5,B002GSXKP6,"I have yet to watch the original Ocean's 11 (included), so I can't speak for that movie. Out of the other three, Ocean's Eleven is a solid A+ and Ocean's Thirteen is easily an A as well. Unfortunately, the middle movie, Ocean's Twelve was rather unimpressive, scoring a meager C in my estimation. With all this said, you simply can't beat the value of owning all four for for $11 -- the first movie alone is well worth that much. The double-sided disks can be a bit annoying to handle and change out, but it is a minor inconvenience and something well overshadowed by the value. If you're willing to spend an extra ~10 sec figuring out which side of the disk you want, in order to save $20+, then this is for you!",1297555200,,713,4.3283582089552235
3925630,5,B002GSXKP6,"Forget the fact that the visual quality on this set is great.  The story line of all four movies is amazing!!! Sequels and re-makes can get dry...but in this case, the first movie is as good as the last.  Not only will all 4 keep you guessing, but the wit and humor will keep you laughing and quoting the characters for MONTHS.  I'm not a big movie person, but I loved all of them!!!",1297036800,5,383,4.148648648648648

3925632,4,B002GSXKP6,"I really was surprised to see that inside the box was literally just two double-sided DVDs.  I guess for the price, you can't get much more, but it felt just about as cheap as it was.  One one side in the center of the disc is the ribbon telling you which side is which movie.  (Note: if you're giving this as a gift to somebody less tech-savvy, explain the double-sided premise.  My mom thought all DVDs and CDs were single-sided)

Nothing spectacular for sure, but for the price you can't beat it.  I was going to buy them in other configurations as a trilogy, but for cheaper and including the original was tough to pass up.",1290988800,,627,4.362068965517241
3925633,5,B002GSXKP6,"Anyone who would deny themselves the opportunity to own all these movies, including the original Oceans 11 with the famous Rat Pack at their best, would determinately be denying themselves a guilty pleasure. George Clooney delivers, just like he did on ""The facts of Life"" TV show in the late 70's. RevMikereview",1290556800,,312,5.019230769230769
3925634,3,B002GSXKP6,The price is right but the doubled-sided dvd is a bit frustrating- you have to stop and think each time you put it in your dvd player to make sure you're playing the right movie.  The only other problem I have is the Oceans 13 dvd has a defect so I need to send it back.  Other than that the movies play well and look good.,1288310400,9,323,3.878787878787879

3925636,5,B002GSXKP6,"I enjoyed Oceans 11 and found Oceans 12 OK. I never saw Oceans 13 nor the original Oceans 11, so when this came up on sale it was a great way to get all four movies for about eight bucks.

There are two disks, each with one of the movies on one side. Unfortunatly, it's hard to read the label on the disk to see which one is which. Other than that small negative, it's a great way to own all four movies at a very nice price.",1286928000,,425,3.8295454545454546

### ABOUT THE 4 FILM FAVORITES SERIES ###

Warner Brothers/New Line's ""4 Film Favorites"" is a line of two-disc sets consisting of four films that are part of a series/franchise or center around a common theme.  Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a ""disc image"") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The ""4 Film Favorites"" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.
