8328413,5,B001NYSWC0,"According to the first-time writer-director's twitter, this flick was shot in 15 days, on Mini-DV (?!), with a budget of $180,000.  Surprisingly, not only does it not show, but the cinematography and shot composition are gorgeous, the work of an assured eye.  And despite the very limited shooting schedule, none of the performances suggest a first take that had to be used because of time constraints.  The budget is the biggest shocker.  While the movie does have a gritty, bare-bones feel, it still has visual style to burn, with a driving electronic score (composed by Robert Ethan Gunnerson, the director), and a cast of veterans, including the always-great Ken Howard, seen recently in both Michael Clayton and Rambo.

The plot shares some similarities with both Taken and Gone Baby Gone, but the tone is a lot closer to the cinema of the seventies, particularly Cassavetes.  Fans of that era will find a helluva lot to savor here.

Peter Facinelli is shockingly good as the ex-cop turned dealer, proving himself to have been criminally underused over the years.  Between his work in this, the excellent Touch the Top of the World (where he played the first blind man to climb Mount Everest), and his devilish work on Showtime's Nurse Jackie, it's easy to see Facinelli becoming another Clooney -- an actor who for many years was seen as a familiar, handsome face, who then showed serious chops in his mid-to-late thirties and became a household name.

If the movie has a flaw, it runs a tad long at 113 minutes.  That said, it's a far richer and more rewarding sit at that length than Transformers is at 2.5 hours.

Arc is one to seek out, Gunnerson is one to watch, and Facinelli is one to reconsider.",1246147200,,1709,4.759322033898305
8328414,5,B001NYSWC0,"A strange but endearing story where Peter Facinelli is a gangsta-type with a hilarious mean streak, but actually ends up doing some pretty great stuff. It has some offensive scenes, but in the name of entertainment, it is one of my favorite Peter Facinelli movies!",1243814400,,264,4.888888888888889
8328415,4,B001NYSWC0,"I remember seeing this guy in Fastlane and thinking he would end up doing something else (better and less mainstream) to prove he has a great talent. Sadly, his minimal performance in Twilight yielded that interest; an onslaught of requests from customers wanting to see something of this guy. Not another teen movie here by any means, but his best performance to date.

Two things make this film stand out. First is Facinelli's totally believable take on a drug addicted, dealing ex-cop who still wants to solve a big case to make things right in his mind. And secondly the filming style mix of black & white, slight color add-ins, and tunnel camera montages. The hand-held camera thing does irritate a great deal of people, but they did it in such a way here that it does not detract from the themes. There is a point in most of the film being devoid of color, especially when the last scene plays out it wraps the reasoning up for most.

The story follows our lead character through a week in his life where everything he has done personally and professionally all comes crashing together in a string of epiphanies. Not much should be said about plot details, but the recommendation can remain strong on some very believable performances, unique filming style, and a strong message of never giving up on what you believe can make your life right. A strong R rating for sexual situations, violence, lots of drug use and language.

The DVD contains little supporting material but is an owner for those fans (both new and old) looking to prove this guy has a strong variance.",1237248000,,1575,4.67870036101083
8328416,5,B001NYSWC0,"I had the privilege of viewing ARC, and the first thing that came to mind was that the trailer did not do this movie justice. When I originally saw the small clip, I knew it looked like a gripping film that I wanted to see. However, I was only a few minutes in to the feature when I suddenly realized that I was in for a real treat! Written and directed by the ingenious Robert Ethan Gunnerson, ARC takes place in the town of Los Angeles, and focuses in on it's more sordid side as a former police officer turned drug addict searches for a missing boy in hopes to redeem his character before his 30th birthday. Using a variety of color schemes throughout the film, Robert not only lures you in visually, but he uses the effects to add a depth to the film that I don't think could have been achieved otherwise.

Now while the cinematography is what originally lured me in to the film, it was the character driven story lines and superb acting that kept me on the edge of my seat. I found it rather interesting that more than once, I felt like I was invading these character's lives. A sort of, fly on the wall, if you will. Robert Ethan Gunnerson did an amazing job of bringing his characters to life, and I look forward to his future projects. He definitely has a bright future ahead of him in the entertainment industry.

Taking the starring role, Peter Facinelli (The Big Kahuna, Scorpion King, Fastlane) delivered a first rate performance the former police officer turned drug addict, Paris Pritchert. Called upon more than once to deliver a raw and emotion filled performance, Facinelli not only embraced his role with a passion, but executed it with flawless precision. It was truly one of his most memorable roles to date, and I think that only further opened my eyes to the still untapped talent he possess. He is truly a master of his craft.",1230336000,5,1849,4.483679525222552
