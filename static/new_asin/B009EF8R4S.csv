8540582,2,B009EF8R4S,"The writer (and star) has watched Christopher Guest comedies (""Best In Show"") as he was writing this movie. The acting is decent and since a bigfoot is never shown, the viewer won't be let down. The problem is there are way too many characters that have their backgrounds told, the jokes get really thin and the murder rampage (not shown) is out of place for the type of movie they were aiming for. The movie could have been funny if they stayed focused on the bigfooting activity (just watch ""Finding Bigfoot"" and the jokes would have written themselves.)",1357516800,,556,4.683673469387755
