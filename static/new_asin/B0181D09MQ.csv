8741105,4,B0181D09MQ,"Great movie, but the subtitles issue and the overdub slightly reduces the enjoyment of the movie.
I speak Russian so it's not a major problem, but non-Russian speakers might find it confusing.
Also disk is a BR-R, not a manufactured Blu Ray.",1535414400,,241,4.761904761904762
8741106,5,B0181D09MQ,"Excellent representation of a genuine WW2, Soviet Red Army heroine sniper.",1522800000,,74,5.818181818181818
8741107,3,B0181D09MQ,"The Movie is excellent, but in this version, the subtitles are terrible. I have seen other versions, even the one available on Amazon Video, in which the subtitles are quite reasonable. This Blue Ray version, however, is to be avoided by all who are not fluent in Russian.",1520812800,,272,4.6875
8741108,5,B0181D09MQ,"Excellent movie. I bet if this were made in America and in spoken English it would likely have made tons of money. It is very well produced and I have already watched it a couple times. If you're looking for Russian movies to watch IN RUSSIAN, this is an excellent choice along with Battalion which I also bought. I would love to see a lot more Russian films on Amazon. So far Amazon seems to have much more than say iTunes does. This one is available as a digital purchase as well which is nice. I liked it better than Enemy at the Gate for sure.",1517011200,,547,4.169811320754717
8741109,3,B0181D09MQ,"The movie is absolutely superb, and, the movie itself is easily worth five stars. The problem, for an English speaker, is the way this blu ray disc handles dialogue. The subtitles themselveswork fine. The problem, which makes this almost unwatchable in the way they have presented this, is that when English is being spoken (and all of the parts of the movie which feature Eleanor Roosevelt, or which take place in the U.S., and this makes up a lot of the movie) you will see the subtitles (in Russian, that's fine) but you will also hear two dialogue tracks simultaneously. You will hear the actual dialogue on the soundtrack, in English or Russian depending on who is speaking, plus you will also hear an overdub in the translated language, which is louder than the dialogue originally in the movie itself. It makes it almost impossible to understand either the translated overdub, or the actual words spoken by the actors. There is no way to turn off the overdubbed language which overlays the original language, and keep the subtitles by themselves.
The blu ray picture itself is gorgeous but I will need to send this back and settle for the dvd in Russian with (only) English subtitles if I can find one.",1511740800,3,1209,4.734597156398104

8741111,5,B0181D09MQ,"Among the finest films I have ever seen.
A treasure, a masterpiece, one of a kind.
Yuliya Peresild is brilliant, a true ""star"".",1492300800,,127,4.565217391304348

8741113,5,B0181D09MQ,"This one of best war films to come out Russia. The aging is good, the story compelling. I thoroughly recommend this film.",1484352000,,121,4.545454545454546
