7794803,2,0977021807,"This is what I would call a ""talkumentary,"" which is mostly women talking, very little actual footage and rather disjointed.  The research must have been tremendous as the number of women pilots interviewed is really astounding,  However, stringing together sound bites sometimes as short as 20 seconds doesn't make for a good historical overview.  I was also hoping for some history about truly great pioneer women pilots, for example, Beryl Markham, if not the first pilot to cross the Atlantic from England to North America certainly the first woman to do so. She was British and the film deals only with Americans. Perhaps the film wanted to concentrate only on living pilots who could be interviewed (there's no mention of Amelia Earhart, thankfully), but it wasn't the history I was looking for.  And there were no women at Kitty Hawk.",1353888000,,841,4.985714285714286
