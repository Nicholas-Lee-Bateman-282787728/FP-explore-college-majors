1782440,3,B00006JU6T,"I love Jim Breuer, so it pains me to write this...
but DVD was a complete letdown. No cursing, no 'Faggot!' bit, and Jim seemed very restrained beause it was done for Comedy Central TV. The background band gets a little annoying at times.
I made the mistake of buying this after I had seen him live at the Improv, and as you know, 99.9% of comedians are better live.
""My Dog Duffy"", in the extras section, was the best bit. There were some funny parts throughout, but overall disappointing. O&A fans will be disappointed as well. BTW, Norton rocks!
Go see Jim Breuer live!",1046908800,2,572,4.457142857142857
1782441,4,B00006JU6T,"I bought this DVD as an early Xmas gift for my boyfriend.  I've never seen any of Jim's work but my boyfriend has.  He said you'll be rolling on the floor when I watch it.  As we watched it, I started getting stomach pains because I was laughing so hard.  My favorite skits are the camel skit in the beginning and the ""Extra"" clip of 'My Dog Duffy.'  Buy this DVD or VHS and you'll see what exactly I'm talking about.",1039305600,3,417,4.098765432098766
1782451,4,B00006JU6T,"Jim Breuer might not be the most famous comedian out there, but he's still good. People might remember him from the movie Half Baked and from his sketches on Saturday Night Live. Think back to his Goat Man and Joe Pesci characters.

I saw ""Jim Breuer: Hardcore"" on TV many years ago and I never forgot it. It was the funniest show I'd seen in a long time. More recently, I finally had the funds to buy it, and it was a good decision.

At the beginning, he talks about war and Afghanistan. I didn't laugh much during that segment, but the entire rest of the DVD was great. My favorite part has to be his take on underage drinking.

Compared to Dane Cook, Breuer is a little less raunchy. Dane Cook has more of a direct approach, while Breuer tends to make things wonderfully goofy. It was a great purchase for me.

The DVD Extras also contain some old footage. I watched the bit about his dog Duffy and the problems that ensue when a dog ages. Toward the end of the segment, Breuer started dry-heaving to illustrate a point. It was fantastic material.

It's a good buy if you have some spare cash.",1245715200,,1096,4.326829268292683
1782452,5,B00006JU6T,Buy this for a Friday night viewing with friends - you will not be disappointed.,1235001600,,80,4.4
1782453,4,B00006JU6T,"The act is not the best, or the most up to date, but Jim Breuer looks hilarious!",1232323200,,80,3.764705882352941
1782454,5,B00006JU6T,"The thing that sets Jim Breuer apart from most comedians today is simple. He's an honest to goodness great storyteller. His jokes are more than just mere setups and puchlines, they are an inside look into his life. When you listen to his standup, you feel as though you've known him for years. Hardcore is a hilarious routine that encapsulates all these elements. From his dead-on impressions of AC/DC, Joe Pesci and Jack Nicholson to imitating his mother talking to him about the type of people he hangs out with, Breuer executes his comedy at brilliant,hilarious lightning speed. He has a limitless amount of energy, his facial expressions are hilarious and his voices are great. This is a must own DVD for anyone who enjoys hilarious, honest comedy.",1175040000,2,752,4.8828125
1782455,4,B00006JU6T,"Breuer is funny as hell. His stand up is getting better and better. What a difference from his old Comedy Central stand up special (Pulp Comics I think). With his tales of growing up on LI, to him becoming a grown up (yeah ok) its pretty darn funny. Cant wait for him to start working on some new stuff, and maybe make some appearances on the Opie and Anthony XM radio show.

To not find his stuff funny means you have no sense of humor, or like Chris Kattan funny (aka awful/terrible idiot comedy). Didnt laugh once...? C-span...? pffft. Someone has it in for a certain comic. And he pretty much stunk on SNL.",1113609600,,610,4.350877192982456
1782456,2,B00006JU6T,"This is utterly and spectacularly lame. Jim Breuer is a modestly talented sketch comic (mid-90's SNL) but excruciating at stand-up.  Lots of yelling, mugging, and running around the stage but it just ain't funny, dude.  We did smile at his spot-on AC/DC imitation, but that was the show's finale.

Looks like most other reviews here are friends-and-family, with pandering quotes like ""You almost get exhausted by just watching him run around the stage like a madman. There is hardly a second that goes by where you're not laughing hysterically.""  Rrrrrighht... My wife and I were so exhausted we switched to C-SPAN and got more laughs watching ""Prime Minister's Question Time"" in British Parliament.",1097884800,,699,5.15929203539823
1782457,4,B00006JU6T,"If you have cable, you probably have seen most of this on Comedy Central. For those cable-challenged, Jim Bruer is most visible from his stint on Saturday Night Live (yeah, he was ""goatboy""). He was also stoner ""Brian"" in the movie Half Baked. Here is his standup (with a heavy metal band backup, thus the ""hardcore""). He works the band in whenever he ends a good joke by breaking into some basic AC/DC cloned metal riff. Yeah, I don't get it either, but Bruer is generally funny. He's only got about three basic voices that are spun into whichever character he's trying to bring forth (which accentuate the core of any of his routines), but does so with conviction and keeps the crowd laughing. Much of his humor is embellished stories from Breur's youth, giving him the fan connection of, `Yeah, I probably partied with that guy in highschool'. A couple of added scenes deleted from the Comedy Central special are some bonus laughs. And if you are really into Jim Bruer, you'll dig the extra footage of his first Comedy Central appearances where you might recognize earlier, less polished versions of his later material.",1096502400,2,1122,4.758974358974359
1782458,5,B00006JU6T,"As a huge AC/DC fan, I loved Jim's impression of the band! Hilarious,accurate and flattering all at once! I also love Jim's Jack Nicholson, I mean he does Jack better than Jack! To the T! His voices, facial expressions are fantastic as are all his stories. Jim,You Rock!!! and so does your back up band! A dvd that will get played over and over.",1082764800,3,345,4.40625
1782459,5,B00006JU6T,"Anytime you see stand-up comedian Jim Breuer take the stage, you know it's going to be a good time.  It's not just a regular night of stand-up, it's a all-out crazy party!  Jim Breuer takes no prisoners in this Comedy Central Special, ""Jim Breuer: Hardcore.""
You almost get exhausted by just watching him run around the stage like a madman.  There is hardly a second that goes by where you're not laughing hysterically.  In this special, Breuer talks about music, drugs, growing up, being a father, being married, and more.  There's also a band that Jim travels around with when he performs, which really separates this comedy special from the rest.
The DVD has a few special features, such as never-aired performance segments and two segments from Jim's first Comedy Central performance.  It's not a lot, but for a comedy special DVD, those are some really cool extras.
The only major drawback is the breaks in where the commercials would usually separate the show if you were watching it on cable.  It kind of ruins the flow at times.  You would really be getting into it all and then all of the sudden there's a little segment break that was intended for commercials.  And there's A LOT of those breaks, so be warned.  Still, it doesn't ruin the overall experience.
If you love comedy that's insane, different, unpredictable, and ""drop-to-the-ground"" funny, then Jim Breuer is your guy.  ""Jim Breuer: Hardcore"" is a must-have for all comedy fans.  A very high replay value on this one.  Check it out as soon as you can.",1057708800,10,1522,4.741444866920152
1782460,5,B00006JU6T,"Jim Bruer is one of a kind when he is live.  If you don't get to see him stand up, then BUY this DVD, even if you do see him stand up, buy this DVD.  Jim keeps you laughing with his body language and physical appearance he displays when doing his stand up.
This DVD is a must have for any Jim Breur fan, no secong thought needed.",1054598400,5,329,3.823529411764706

7970648,5,B00006JU6T,I first watched this comedy special on the television when it came out on Comedy Central over 10 years ago. After that my father purchased it and my family still can't stop quoting from it. It brought my family together for a time. We all got along when this was playing. It was pretty great and I'm glad to have it again.,1368748800,,322,4.209677419354839
7970649,5,B00006JU6T,"This is a great stand up performance by Jim Breuer, my personal favorite bit is the one about AC/DC I always crack up hysterically during it! I don't understand how Jim Breuer isn't more popular, he should be one of the top stand up performers, he's definitely a lot funnier than many of them! Buy this special you won't be let down.",1366675200,,333,4.387096774193548
7970650,5,B00006JU6T,I bought this as a present for myself after hearing him on satellite radio and recognizing him as Goat Boy.  My husband and I watched it together and both seriously came close to wetting our pants!  Jim is very physical with his comedy and his impersonations are head on (especially ACDC).  I was also impressed by  the fact that he is pretty clean (maybe 3-4 cursewords in the entire routine).  Highly recommend it!,1334016000,,416,4.6438356164383565
7970651,5,B00006JU6T,Words can't describe how hilarious Jim Breuer is. His stand up is great and SNL skits are just too awesome.,1328572800,,107,4.4
7970652,5,B00006JU6T,"In my opinion breuers best performance.  Very funny, talking about playing baseball as a kid and hitting the ball over the fence with the nasty dog is funny and well done.",1306972800,,171,4.516129032258065
7970653,5,B00006JU6T,Jim Brewer is hyterical!! Seen him live in comedy clubs twice over the years!! He's at his very best in this one! My husband and I still quote his routine constantly!!! LOL,1276646400,,172,4.40625
7970654,5,B00006JU6T,"Ok I saw this on comedy central about a thousand times so I thought it was about time that I buy the dvd so I wouldn't have to wait for the commericals to end before I get the next joke. Thing is something was left out. Remember in the comedy central version where he quotes Metallica? Well for some reason it's not in the dvd which kinda makes me mad, but I laugh every time I watch it.",1274227200,,387,3.9743589743589745
7970655,5,B00006JU6T,Just can't seem to miss with Jim Breuer and it is great to see his older stuff. Another great DVD - he's hilarious.,1262995200,,115,4.043478260869565
