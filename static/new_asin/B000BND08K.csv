8089264,5,B000BND08K,"OK...I admit it. Im an older Westlife fan....and I'm proud of it!!!!
This group has notched up some amazing ""records"" in the music industry , yet are always pushed to the back of the music stands outside of their native Ireland and Great Britain!!
They are simply an incredible hard working group of men with so much talent and beautiful voices. I reccomend ALL of their DVDs . This one is good ...like all the others...
.It covers all of their music from the very start to present day (excluding ""Home""). Well worth an  entry in your music collection!!
Go On...Give'em a go.....you know you want to.....and I won't tell a soul!
It'll be our little secret!",1245715200,,656,4.6068376068376065

I have never seen them in concert and being in the usa makes it even harder but this tour was simply amazing and they're so charming. they are great performers . each having their own distinct voice, and the rat pack part was awesome. it would have made ol' blue eyes proud. even my grandma said so. it's very entertaining for any age.

8089266,5,B000BND08K,"A top quality, creatively produced, concert DVD that entertains from beginning to end. The hits are here with energetic performances and awesome production. Westlife takes you on a musical journey paying homage to various music generations.

Intertwined with their many #1's they pay tribute to various musical generations and musical styles. These young men enjoy entertaining, feed off the audiances energy, and repay their loyalty with a thoroughly entertaining concert.

You will sing along, get up and dance and watch this DVD again and again.

Get a DVD player that plays PAL (very available in the USA)and show this to your family and friends. GREAT FUN!!!",1156550400,4,663,5.235849056603773
