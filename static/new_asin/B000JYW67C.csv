Dupah Is that Polish?, has yet to bite. We follow his tails and tribulations, and put up in inane one liners as he learns how to deal with vampire chow.

Unfortunately, the one lines come so fast that you cannot fast forward through the movie. You might miss the only one you like; that is poetic license.

There is one redeeming value and that is a picture of Farrah Fawcett.

An added plus is that they put the names with the faces in the credits. They should do that with more of the movies.",1503705600,2,541,4.123809523809523

8153687,4,B000JYW67C,"I grew up with a Polish grandmother who constantly used ""dupa"" as a swear word (I won't give away what it means). When my family watched this movie for the first time we died laughing. Yeah, it's a terrible movie, but wonderfully terrible. The Cher/Bono skit is one of the highlights. If you've never seen it you absolutely should not buy it. Rent it first. Whenever I show it to any of my friends, they reconsider the friendship while I break out in hysterics yet again.",1358208000,,471,4.488372093023256
8153688,2,B000JYW67C,"Made by and starring Mark Pirro as Dupah, ""A Polish Vampire in Burbank"" is a low budget horror spoof with a decent premise, but lagging execution. Also featuring Eddie Deezen (the actual credit reads ""With Eddie Deezen as 'Sphincter'""), Conrad Brooks (of Ed Wood fame), and I'm sorry to report, Paul Farbman as ""The Queerwolf."" With a cast like this how could you miss?

Dupah is a slacker and very reluctant vampire, living in a castle in Burbank with his hottie sister and oppressive father, he hangs out all day in his coffin, which has the famous Farrah Fawcett poster inside. Dupah waits for his Dad to bring him takeout baggies of leftover blood (which he drinks with a straw) every night, until finally Dad puts his foot down and insists that Dupah become a ""bloodwinner"" in his own right. Dupah is shy because he is embarrassed that he has small fangs. His sister insists that ""size means nothing"" and takes Dupah out for his first blood.

We quickly learn that Dupah had a brother, Sphincter, who was an even less successful vampire than Dupah. There is extremely bad stop motion footage of Deezen disintegrating into a skeleton (he wasn't back home before the sun rose), and Sphincter returns as the ghostly skeleton. The effect is even less terrifying than you might expect. As an aside, I have to mention the soundtrack at this point: it is heinous, particularly in the Sphincter-as-skeleton part of the film. Talk about a rasp to the head.

Dupah finds a girl, Delores Lane (Lori Sutton), who is not only pretty, but is crazy about vampires. How could Dupah not get himself some blood? Easy: he falls in love with Delores. The next few minutes of the film are probably the worst. They involve Delores, Misty (Delores' valley girl roommate with the most bogus diction ever), Dupah, Sphincter, the Queerwolf, an amazingly stupid Jacuzzi encounter, a pool party, the worst CCR cover band in history, and an even worse Sonny and Cher impersonation, whose singing causes a black cat to scat like Scatman Crothers. You need no more details than that to accurately evaluate the comic genius present here.

Dupah is having a difficult time biting Delores: he's thwarted by everything from the Queerwolf, to the sun, and finally, a garden shed. The best scene of the film (involving a Solarcaine billboard) ensues, and, despite mocking Dupah's small teeth, Delores is finally bitten to the victorious anthem of the ""Rocky"" theme. (Boo!) Once bitten, Delores really gets into the whole biting scene. When Misty and Delores' ex-boyfriend get frisky with a slinky (don't ask), the newly vampiritic Delores puts a bite on her ex in the most painful way imaginable. Ultimately both Dupah and Delores transmogrify into skeletons in the sun and a dog steals Sphincter's foot, putting the universe once again in proper alignment.

The film had numerous production problems, availability issues with Eddie Deezen apparently ranking as chief among them. The movie does have some funny moments, but could have been much better with a bit more nuance. ""Airplane!"", for example, is a legendary spoof that appeals to all ages; ""A Polish Vampire in Burbank"" has difficulty attracting an adult audience due to the puerile nature of the script. Some B-movie aficionados will like this movie, but many purists won't because Pirro is intentionally trying to make a B-movie, which diminishes the attraction for many true fans of bad movies.",1265241600,5,3424,4.927209705372617
