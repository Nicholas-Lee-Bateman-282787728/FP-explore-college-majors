8600687,5,B00E3PLN72,"This may not be a well known feature but it is a really good flick.  The 3D is amazing and visuals are first class and inspired.  But it is the story that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.  The story spans so many generations resting in the wild west, the 20's, i believe, and then on Mars!  It has great characters and logical progression with some conspiracy thrown in for good measure.  I remember it being good but forgot just how good it was and it's even better in 3D!",1516838400,,484,4.161290322580645
