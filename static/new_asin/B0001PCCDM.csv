8075917,1,B0001PCCDM,"This DVD won't help you, if you are looking forward to do a kitchen remodel yourself. I watched it start to finish with out learning any technique. The movie is ""over"" edited and looks like the portions you really want to watch and learn are removed. Sorry, I have to return this DVD.",1337904000,,284,4.377358490566038
8075918,1,B0001PCCDM,This may have been released on DVD in 2004 but it was obviously filmed much earlier.  The included printable pamphlet is dated 1986 and video appears to be about the same time.  They attempt to cover so much material in so little time that it's really just an overview of what it takes to remodel a kitchen.  It provides little value for the do it yourself viewer.,1259280000,4,364,4.402985074626866
