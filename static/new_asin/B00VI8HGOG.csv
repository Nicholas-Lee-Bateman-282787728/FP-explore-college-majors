7090481,5,B00VI8HGOG,"In Search of Chopin is a captivating exploration of the Composers life, artistic development and profound contribution to music. The production, written, filmed and directed by British documentarian Phil Grabsky, is enhanced by the silken, low key narration of Juliet Stevenson. Chopins letters are brought to life by Royal Shakespeare Company actor, David Dawson. Lovely interior and exterior shots of Warsaw, Vienna and Paris as well as atmospheric archival material are abundant at every turn. The musical examples are well chosen. A number of pianists and scholars are represented. The contributions of Leif Ove Andsnes, Daniel Barenboim, Ronald Brautigam, Lars Vogt, Kevin Kenner, Nelson Goerner, Jeremy Siepman and Hershey Felder are particularly stimulating. The commentary and musical analyses are consistently observant, even poetic. There are many revealing close ups of hands and keyboards, less so of medium shots or facial expressions. Much emphasis is placed upon Chopins fervent Polish identity which finds its most direct expression in the many Mazurkas and Polonaises he composed. The seminal influences of Bach, Mozart and opera are noted as is the composers highly personal approach to orchestration. This last controversial topic is persuasively addressed in an interview with Marc Destrube, concertmaster of the Orchestra of the 18th Century. The videography is lustrous, meticulously composed, organized and edited. The sound pickup is topnotch. In Search of Chopin is nearly 2 hours in duration but you hardly realize it. In fact, one comes away craving more. This is a valuable document and deserves the widest dissemination.",1458864000,5,1649,5.6
7090482,5,B00VI8HGOG,"After owning and enjoying other Grabsky titles (Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn), I had waited impatiently for this new title on Chopin. It is thoroughly enjoyable, as were the others. The personal histories of these composers are fascinating, showing the locations, buildings and even rooms were they were born, lived, and developed their artistic talents. Histories of their lives were researched and augmented by actual personal letters to family and friends. I would prefer to have these in Blu-ray format, but suppose the production costs would be prohibitive. Even so, the quality of the DVD presentation is surprisingly good. Bravo, Mr. Grabsky! Next composer?",1454112000,13,664,5.456310679611651
8710218,5,B00VI8HGOG,This is a must watch if you are curious about Chopin's life and his music. Interpretations and perspective from historians and pianists should add more understanding about the pieces he composed during his life. This documentary may not tell you EVERYTHING about Chopin's life but it touches important aspects and backgrounds when some of his works were written. This film is absolutely worth spending your time watching and learning.,1531353600,,434,5.304347826086956

8710220,4,B00VI8HGOG,"At first I thought the movie was about Mozart because the movie seemed to dwell on his music. It is true that Chopin's favorite composer was Mozart, but I don't think that much time should have been devoted to his music. It is difficult to critique this film because Chopin's music, as so well stated, is so personal that it defies description , at least in words.  Chopin spoke only to his piano and through his music one can come close to understanding the depth of his genius.. He was at times joyful and fun-loving , and at other times angry ,depressed and full of rage.  I enjoyed seeing and listening to wonderful Hershey Felder, a favorite of mine and thousands of others who have seen his shows on Chopin, Beethoven and now I hear Tschaikovsky.  But to sum it up. Chopin was like no other composer, from the past or I cannot even envision,  the future. The movie did a fairly good job in expressing this . But no movie or book can come close to describing and explaining the passion that was his and his alone.",1509494400,4,1018,4.398936170212766

8710222,2,B00VI8HGOG,"Good for getting drowsy enough to fall asleep and not much else. I actually started looking forward to Chopin's death because then I knew the darn film would soon be over. The talking heads gushing on and on and on about how wonderful Chopin was got to be really irritating, I started wondering what Chopin would have thought of it -- and decided he would have hated this film.",1500163200,,377,4.478260869565218

8710226,2,B00VI8HGOG,"In Search of Chopin is part of a series filmed by Phil Grabsky. Having seen several films about Chopin and read books about him, I expected something a bit more scholarly than our present product. There are several musical performances offered here in bits and pieces. In some sequences there is a cut from one performer to another and the quality and tuning of the instruments is particularly disturbing. Hardly any of the pianos used in this film were remotely in tune. At the beginning of the film, one is lead to believe that Polish musicologists are going to answer burning questions about Chopin that have not yet been addressed, but this is not the case. Only two or three Polish scholars are interviewed at all. We see mostly external pictures of places where Chopin lived, performed, etc. We might have been taken into the National Castle. Although all of these places are rebuilt after WWII, they might have been shown in old photographs or paintings just as effectively for these purposes. The artists used in the execution of the works by Chopin are not the world's leading pianists. Many artists would have gladly contributed to a film of this nature, but Grabsky goes with Ronald Brautigam, a self-proclaimed ""classicist"" to play the Ballade, Op 23 no. 1. The only world class musician among them was Daniel Barenboim. Leif Ove Andsnes was capable, but by no means is associated with Chopin so strongly as this film might merit. The fact that Chopin's life was so short might have warranted more discussion about his rise in popularity. Facts like ""Chopin only gave 30 public performances"" or he ""wore the clothing of the aristocracy in order to mix with the aristocracy"" were not as interesting as the ideas of what he was paid for what manuscripts.

Generally I adore films like this that gently introduce fans of a composer to their background and music. This, however, is so superficial, it is not appropriate for a music library in a university. More likely a pubic library in a small town where little Suzie is studying piano and wants to learn something about Chopin. Keep going! Do more interesting research. It is FUN and will delight your MORE curious audiences and edify the people who think they are only superficially interested.",1462320000,7,2256,4.829457364341085
8710227,5,B00VI8HGOG,"the whole series of ""in search for..."" is excellent and highly recommend.",1461542400,2,73,5.166666666666667
