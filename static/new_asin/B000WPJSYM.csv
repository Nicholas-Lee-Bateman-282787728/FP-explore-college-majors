2989053,4,B000WPJSYM,This is a very graphic video but it's an important work historically speaking because it reminds us not to forget what happened in the holocaust and why it must never happen again.,1278115200,35,180,4.65625
2989054,4,B000WPJSYM,"Perhaps it is just as well that this is grainy and sometimes out of focus, because the scenes are so horrifying.  The documentary was made by the U.S. Government as an overview of what American soldiers found when they liberated Nazi concentration camps.  It would have been extremely difficult to fake any of the scenes.

I've talked with soldiers who were there, who took pictures and listened to the pleas of the living.  They also smelled the camps, and that cannot be conveyed in this grainy DVD.  Still, it is bad enough.

This is not a comprehensive or in-depth depiction, but it is as much as I can stand to watch.  How anyone could deny that the Holocaust happened boggles the mind.",1200441600,92,691,4.614754098360656

I had thought it was the player I was using so tried it in the DVD/VHS player in my living room and it is far worse.  I realize it's pictures from the war, but I'm referring to the quality of the audio itself.  Too bad because it's really a big piece of history.

2989058,5,B000WPJSYM,"I had seen a few of these nazi concentration camp movies, but nothing I have seen compares to what is on this movie. It will make those with the strongest stomach sick. How one human could do to another human being what the german people did to the Jews and all peoples within these nazi concentration camps is beyond belief. Not even children were spared. After watching the part covering the concentration camps I felt nothing could be worse. The Nurembugr Trials shows things that were very hard to watch. What you see will bring tears to a grown man. I thought Vietnam was bad. It was nothing compared to germany's hate and evil toward mankind of other nations and even many of their own. hitler was a mad man, yet he became the leader of a country, germany. How could such a thing happen, I don't have the answer yet we are seeing some of the same beastly actions in the Mid-East and around the world by a group of people much like the germans of World War II. I have seen the movie, The Nuremburg Trials. I'll never whatch it again because it is nothing like the real thing. Maybe I should have waited to write this, but I didn't. I have just finished watching it and I am mad, hurting, and sick to my stomach. Both men and women can become beast. All it takes is hate. A great deal of hate. Seeing what is going on around the world today I now wonder if mankind ever learns from his past. It seems I have lived long enough to see the truth. We don't learn from our past. In the short term yes, but not in the long term. God help us.",1421107200,2,1539,4.220338983050848

2989061,5,B000WPJSYM,"I was an Officer in the USAF, and I had two uncles who served in the U.S. Army during World War II which included some involvement in the liberation of concentration camps.  They refused to discuss the subject during their entire lives.  Now, since I have viewed this DVD a number of times, I can understand why. The only comment one of my Uncles spoke, was the Nations of the world were in such denial, that they could not believe what occurred in those camps - until it was too late.  Now I understand why my deceased Father who was a MSgt in the USAAF, and my Uncles taught me and my Brothers that Jesus Christ was a Jew; attack a Jew means you attack me also!  I have seen several documentaries and DVD movies on this subject.  But this DVD presents the subject in one significant whole about the camps.  In addition, the second documentary in this DVD, provides a complete coverage of the defendants in the Nuremburg Trials.  I agree with Supreme Court Justice Jackson, and the prosecutor Taylor Telford -  in any system of law, when anyone is an accessory to the crime as well as the actual perpetrator, all of them are equally accountable because at the bar in Nuremburg, the value of one human being in particular and civilization in general were compromised. No individual can claim to perpetrate such crimes in the Nazi Concentration Camps with the excuse in uniform that they were just ""following orders"" or the lack of accountability because the Nuremburg Laws were the Law of the Land.  The Natural Law - the universal inherent standard of right and wrong can not be set aside; this is why the Nuremburg Code of 1947-1948 became international law, which re-affirmed the platform for international courts of law for crimes against humanity in combat operations of war - including asymmetrical war operations.  The quality of this DVD is not that spectacular, nevertheless, the
content supplements this a hundred-fold.  Want to understand this tragedy?  Get this DVD, and you will join with both the nations and the Jews who assert no more holocaust!  Although my Father and Uncles are deceased, I am proud to have relatives who
the State of Israel declared righteous; this DVD reminds succeeding generations the responsibility is ours to prevent another

However, one must remember the footage was shot over 50 years ago, in wartime conditions, so that is to be expected.
