3414549,3,B0018B7E8G,"Disk two of season two has scratches and has a skip in the show on the next to last episode near the end.  I thought I was buying new disks.  The show itself is a bit of far fetched at times, entertaining though.",1215129600,2,212,3.9069767441860463

3414573,4,B0018B7E8G,"Weeds seasons 1-3 is funny and yet also shows a look into the reality of life for some people, the struggles and dilemmas of everyday family life.  Has some adult content, so certainly shouldn't be a selection for family hour.",1230249600,,226,4.65

Its laugh out loud funny! and kevin nealon is absolutely halarious!! The dvds arrived earlier than expected (on a friday), and i watched all three seasons during the course of the weekend. My only disapointment is i didn't realize there were only 4 seasons thus far, and since i don't currently get Showtime, im going to have to wait for the realese of the next dvd until i can continue the story....",1227484800,,526,4.489583333333333
3414578,5,B0018B7E8G,"Weeds has a wonderful cast, and the program is truly addicting. I could have watched all three seasons in one sitting, if I had that kind of time available. Absolutely amazing show! Aside from the fact that Weeds makes for a great comedy, this Seasons 1-3 package is a fantastic deal for the price! I'm very happy with this purchase.",1227312000,,333,4.566666666666666

3414583,5,B0018B7E8G,"Weeds is hilarious, irreverent, brilliantly written and delightfully cast.
It pulls no punches and is not for anyone thats easily offended or faint of heart.
For those who can handle it straight up with no chaser, Weeds is a diabolically funny,sexy
journey to a place that delisciously redefines dysfunctional.",1225324800,,310,5.346938775510204
3414584,3,B0018B7E8G,This show is pretty good.  Not very realistic but for entertainment it's worth watching.  Description said it was a gut buster comedy but it wasn't.  A laugh here and there but not gut busting.,1225152000,,193,4.617647058823529
3414585,5,B0018B7E8G,"Not reality in any way, but an entertaining diversion from life.
Also like Desperate Housewives, and very silly new show Pushing Daisies",1225065600,,136,5.2272727272727275
3414586,4,B0018B7E8G,"I absolutely LOVE the show Weeds. However, whenever I received the boxed set, the Dvd's had slipped out of their cases, which caused them to move around in their sleeves. Some of the Dvd's were lightly scratched, which made it difficult to watch, but they were easily repaired so that I can enjoy them over and over again!",1224806400,,322,4.568965517241379
3414587,5,B0018B7E8G,"This show is just too great to describe.  Once you start watching the first season, you won't want to stop.  I can't wait for Season 4 to hit DVD.",1224374400,,146,4.0
3414588,5,B0018B7E8G,"In the interest of honesty, I must confess a thing for both Elizabeth Perkins and Mary-Louise Parker. With that in mind, I think Weeds is the show that finally put Showtime on the map. It's funny, real, controversial and fun. Each season leaves you wanting more. You don't just watch the show you're invested. Bravo Showtime; you've done it!",1224115200,,341,4.796610169491525

3414591,5,B0018B7E8G,I have heard so much about this show but never watched it until I saw how cheap the seasons 1-3 were. Definitely worth buying. Awesome show!!!,1220745600,,142,4.5

Very entertaining, I highly recommend it.",1220659200,,106,4.35
3414593,5,B0018B7E8G,"From the beginning of season 1 to the end of season 3 you do not want to quit watching.  There are some side plots that become somewhat irrelevant and make you wonder why it was part of the show, but for the most part the show is a 10!  And with such a great deal for all 3 seasons you can't go wrong.  I have never seen more than one episode before buying the seasons and I would still recommend this buy to anyone who enjoys good television.  This show is not for the kids and can be a bit racey, but it all adds to the feel of the show.  I can't wait for season 4 on DVD!",1220140800,,574,3.7899159663865545

3414596,5,B0018B7E8G,"I was so happy to find a 'box' set on Amazon made especially for them to distribute.  It not only saved me money, but all of the DVDs came together so I didn't have to wait for them all to arrive!  I have always been a follower of Weeds and I thought I would buy the DVDs to catch up on whats happening so that I wouldnt be lost once Season 4 started!  The show is hilarious and I cant wait to see the end of season 4!! Its getting so good!",1219622400,,440,3.760869565217391
3414597,5,B0018B7E8G,"This Amazon Exclusive bundle gives anyone with access to Blu-Ray, the chance to experience this comedy that throws dog droppings on our ideas of an ideal community, family, and our tremulous American Dream. Those who have followed the show should watch for details missed during the seasons that began in 2005 with a more mild mannered Nancy Botwin.  We now have watched her transformation into the irresistible and provocative character she is now, but the journey is nice to see all at once.

Amazon's bundle is simply the 3 seasons shrink wrapped in their respective jackets offered at a lower price than apart -- Costco-esque.  The extra features are fun and really -- of the few Blu-Ray/HDDVD/DVD discs you buy -- how many do you ACTUALLY watch?  This one you will watch.",1219536000,,776,4.856060606060606

season 1-3 are good seasons. Important to watch before veiwing season 4.  However, season 4 is the BEST soo far.  I hope they make a looot more seasons.  MMM!!! season 4 is the best!! did i mention season 4 is better than one,two, and three?  the series is about sex, drugs, alchol, relationships, and luck, some times good, more often bad.  at times 1-3  definatly will keep you on the edge of you'r seat.  has strond drug use  included--<DUGH>  mostly recomende3d for stoners, cus they would understand the lingo de best.  THIS IS THE JETSONS MEETS CHIN & CHOKE or what ever there names was back in the day.  season 1-3 has someBONGusage, clear pappers--look out clear papers, are a lot more damaging to the lungs than tree papers--if you get this series, be prepared to sit in fron of your boob tube for hours on in---that is unless you are getting it to TRY to understand your kids.  then i advise aginst this series. a book would probly be better for you in that sense.  1-3 is a good drama, mild comidy, an if your dry, it will make you cry.  basiclly its the next generation sitcom --if you don't mind being flashed or if you don't mind hearing cuss words or if you are not offended by tokers, or smokers, beware all seasons have a few JOKERS, season 4 has the BEST T&A an OH its amazing A  deff AAA+++ A -noxperton the T here.",1218326400,,1391,4.421259842519685
