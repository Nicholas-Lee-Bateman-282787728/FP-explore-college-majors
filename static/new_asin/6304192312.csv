816256,5,6304192312,"I had heard about the independent films of actor/director John Cassavetes when I was a teenager.  I remember his acting in ""The Dirty Dozen"" and various other movies but I don't think I had the chance to see his work as a director until I watched ""Faces"" last night.  After a sceptical start, I came away impressed with this movie.

""Faces"" as I saw it, is a movie about the emptiness of life in some people.  The film opens with a very particular movie producer going in for a screening of a new film.  Afterwards, I came to understand that Cassavetes was ""putting on"" the film industry by suggesting that they were the very people he was trying to portray in ""Faces"".  The first half hour or so of the movie I found to be rather awkward and difficult to follow.  We see three inebriated people joking around.  I guess I felt it was a pointless look at pointless lives.  I thought the movie picked up when some wives went out on the town.  They were looking for a good time although they didn't seem to have a common definition of what that would be.  They stumble across a good-looking young guy who is full of fun and energy and they take him home.  Despite the general drunkeness of the parties involved, the young guy, named Chet, manages to reach out to each of the four ladies and try to turn them on to his upbeat look on life.  Each of them gets drawn in initially and then rebels their way back into their own deadend outlook on life; the last one in a most extreme way.  Chet, the little blue bird of happiness, seems to be a contrast to the depressing reality everyone else finds themselves comfortable in.  A switch to a different scene with John Marley and Gena Rowlands weakened the flow of the movie but served to give us a message that happiness is always temporary in an unhappy mind.  The movie ends with two of the main characters drifting back into the boredom they have accustomed themselves to.

There were a lot of innovative angles to ""Faces"" that film junkies might enjoy.  The wandering hand-held camera (held steadier than mine) gives an intimate sense of being a part of the party.  The title, I thought, came from the near-constant close-ups of all of the characters involved.  Some of the acting, particularly that of Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel, is very good.  I mentioned that the beginning was a bit tedious.  I was wondering if it was going to be worth the ""effort"" to watch the whole movie.  However, the second half left me impressed with a look at a world where the only enjoyment seems to come out of a bottle.  Heaven forbid we should have to deal with one another face to face.  I did not enjoy the life ""Faces"" showed me but I certainly came away enjoying the life I live.",1152230400,,2717,4.41851106639839
816257,4,6304192312,"John Cassavetes is certainly an interesting director (great actor too, but interesting director).  Instead of directing films for entertainment, he directs them to present a ""slice-of-life"", so to speak, only one that is usually tumultuous and unkind.  His movies are generally uphill battles to watch, but they're worth it.

In this film, an over-the-hill man and woman break up and persue other, younger paramours.  While successful, they still have to deal with their own separate pain and fear of many things, amongst them age, loneliness, and friendship.

The writing and the acting are the most important parts.  The writing is at times brilliant, the rest of the time brutal.  Cassavetes tries for a more realistic, human approach, which means characters go off in tangents, talk unproductively, and are often really mean to each other.  The acting complements the dialog so perfectly that one doesn't see actors on screen, but characters; only moreso than characters, one sees people, as if watching a home video with a disturbing and powerful plot.

Cassavetes was also one to specifically not care about structure.  This makes the directing, editing, and cinematography rather jarring and condense.  Luckily, it works with the themes of this movie well enough that the movie itself maintains a sense of entrapment and abuse.

It's a great film, though it's an uphill battle to watch.  It's amazingly written but it's very inaccessible.  I'd recommend it, but you must heed that it won't be something you can just sit down and escape into.

816258,5,6304192312,"This is John Cassavettes' first film, that developed out of an improvisational acting workshop. For sheer power and authenticity (which are different from ""realism"") there is nothing like Cassavettes' non-studio films. Essential viewing for those who are interested in American cinema, especially the rise of auteur-based work that began in the '70s and continues (at least ostensibly, with a few films here and there) in the independent film scene today.

One note on this edition: there is a finer edition of this film available through the Criterion Collection, but you can't buy it ""a la carte."" You need to get it with the John Cassavettes collection, that includes this along with Shadows, Killing of a Chinese Bookie, Opening Night, and A Woman Under the Influence, and a solid (even if it could use some trimming and doesn't really work as a feature film in its own right) documentary on Cassavettes. The criterion version of Faces, along with a better transfer, also includes an alternate opening of this film (which was substantially altered after its initial release).

This is not a bad one to own as it stands. But if you really become captivated by this or have already become captivated by one of Cassavettes' other films, you'll be kicking yourself for buying this one and will really want to buy the bigger collection.

It's technically raw, the sound's bad and half the time I had no idea what was going on, but it builds to a brilliant portrait of four lonely lives.  The bad jokes and laughter that eat up so much film time connect loose, rambunctious scenes that defy strict narrative logic--after a while it feels like you're watching this movie from the inside, right in the thick of the cigarettes and booze.  As usual, Cassavetes shoots the '60s from unexpected angles:  his focus is on the middle-aged middle managers and their fading suburban wives, stuck on the wrong side of the Sexual Revolution but still desperate to feel young and fulfilled.  The movie doesn't make fun of them but brings you into their world, where disappointment, age and the pressures of conformity are finally getting the best of their vitality.  Imagine ""The Graduate"" told from Mrs. Robinson's point of view.  The powerful last scene ends in silence after a suicide attempt--no laughs, no routines.  The death of a marriage or a new beginning?  Cassavetes rarely matched this level of intensity.  ""Faces"" is one of his very best.",1037750400,11,1151,4.7969543147208125
816261,4,6304192312,"Faces.  The ones we put on for loved ones, for business associates, for friends, to impress, to hide ourselves behind, the ugly ones, maybe the real ones.
John Cassavetes' films are personal explorations.  They don't ignore conventions of film or theater but instead refuse to adhere to them.
The actors in Faces are exploring their characters from the inside out using improvised type methods (but writer/director  Cassavetes created and adhered to real scripts prior to filming).
There's a rawness and vitality to the film that had almost never been captured on film before.  At times the actors are trying too hard to dance on the edge of what an audience would be able to watch and accept.  They are being characters, not presenting them to us, and they are not trying to be likeable or clever.
At times, the film sets up what is supposed to be an authentic and 'real' moment and then insists on selling it so hard as a real moment it becomes difficult and almost embarassing to watch because it's missed it mark.  The truly awful Bennett Cerf style riddles and jokes husband (John Marley) tells his wife and then cackles on and on about as if they are truly funny is a truly annoying scene to watch.  Were they meant to comment on how phony attempting to find and film a real moment truly is?
There's the long first scene of the film where one of the actors doesn't quite have the skill to shift tones convincingly. The idea of that is a great one though.
All of the ideas which challenge what a film and acting is are good ones.  They don't always work, but through it the culture of American life is examined in a raw, honest way.
Here it's the marriage of an upper middle class couple which is under examination.  The roles of men and women.  The meaning perhaps of love, communication, and marriage.
Faces is a raw experimental film where actors are allowed to be both natural and ...well method actors.  Some moments work so well, you wonder why these heights aren't regularly strived for... but then some moments don't work at all and you realize, this is film-making without a net. It's risky, it's not pretty, and it's messy - -  For the performers particularly.
It's a masterpiece, though like many of J.C.'s film difficult to watch.  You might be annoyed, bored, bothered, and/or disgusted by the film.  At the end you might not quite understand what it all was about.
But, you'll remember it.

816262,2,6304192312,This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films.

816263,1,6304192312,"I wanted to like John Cassavetes, I really did.  I love the idea of total disregard for the system, complete focus on the actors (sloppy technicalities be damned), & being as intimate & realistic as possible.  However, this requires realistic acting and likable characters.  The acting, especially in the opening drinking scene, is HORRIBLE.  No one acts like this when they're drunk; it's way too overdone, even for theater it would be overdone, & it's embarrassing to watch.  These characters just talk & talk, going in circles: everybody's happy, then things get tense, then somebody tries to make a joke & everybody's happy again but not as happy as before.  It's painfully transparent in every scene what Cassavetes is trying to say & where he's going, but it takes FOREVER to get there.  I clocked the drinking scene at seventeen minutes.  Even a well-written scene in a movie will get old at seventeen minutes, and this is not a well-written scene, it is seventeen minutes of bad acting and unknowable, unlikable characters talking in circles.  ""But people talk in circles in real life.""  I know people talk in circles in real life, but certain things in real life are just boring on the screen.  And the laughing...the actors realized that people laugh a lot in conversation, so they laugh...a lot.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so much laughing in it.  This might have turned the movie into something very warm & personal, but these people laugh at the stupidest things -- nothing they laugh at is ever funny.  This makes all the laughter seem forced, it makes the actors look bad, & it makes the characters look stupid. I'm sure there was a point in here about adultery and husband & wife relations, but it was lost on me in a flurry of bad acting & scenes that refused to end.  I do appreciate what Cassavetes was trying to do & his influence on cinema.  If it weren't for him, there would be none of the intimate, cut-to-the-bone scenes in 'Mean Streets' and 'Raging Bull.'  But though I can appreciate it, I still can't bear to watch it.",972172800,10,2063,4.654696132596685
816264,3,6304192312,"The trademark of John Cassavetes films is emotions laid bare. You might call this an emotion strip tease without the tease. This film is no exception. However, it is not as focused as his later Woman Under the  Influence or Opening Night. Some scenes loose their effectiveness by their  length. A tighter editing would have worked wonders. Nevertheless, the film  has a strong emotional impact, a harbinger of his later films, and  arresting structural innovations; well worth watching.",963705600,2,486,5.1923076923076925
816265,5,6304192312,"""Faces"" carries the dubious distinction of being considered the first ""breakthrough"" independent American feature.
""Faces"" is a John Cassavetes film. It is also categorically  one of the two or three greatest masterpieces of American cinema. (This is  neither just a personal opinion, nor an exaggeration. This film is  essential.) What makes this film so special will be lost on many domestic  viewers, unfortunately, who simply aren't prepared for the experience.  Nearly everything about the film is subversive of conventional Hollywood  filmmaking techniques, and this is frustrating for people who aren't ready  for it. For example, the film never ""tells"" you anything about  the characters: you have to patiently observe them throughout the film,  just as if they were real other people in the room. Furthermore, in typical  Cassavetes' style, the characters' behavior is extreme, which can be  unsettling. Finally, the film is pretty grim. However, if you're ready for  a new experience, and can approach the viewing experience with an open and  tolerant mind, this film will BLOW YOU AWAY.
The DVD is nothing special;  I'm just grateful to have the film. The transfer isn't particularly sharp,  and was made off an inglorious print. Framing -- full frame -- seems fine;  if I remember correctly, the original (16mm) is not widescreen, so nothing  should be lost. (The odd cropping that appears throughout the film is  intentional.)

816467,5,6304192312,"John Cassavetes was a sometime actor but primarily indie film director extraordinaire, and Faces was one of his best directing works.  His beautiful real-life wife Gena Rowlands, then an Angie Dickinson lookalike, was his muse in many of his films including this one, playing a party girl/call girl with an assortment of men friends fighting over her attentions.  One of the guys is John Marley (best remembered for his role as the Hollywood producer in the first Godfather, who finds a horse's head in his bed), who plays an unhappily married successful businessman, whose wife is also unfaithful.  Seymour Cassel, a regular Cassavetes film participant, has a delightful role here of a ladies man barfly who has a group of disillusioned middle aged ladies enamored of him, all hoping to be his choice of the evening.  In the different situations everyone is drinking highballs and making social attempts at gaiety to hide their inner unhappiness, which may be where the Faces title comes from, i.e. putting on a social face to hide the real person inside; although as well, there are many facial closeups of the actors throughout the film.  One of the loveliest though somber film jazz scores ever, the soundtrack was made into a record that I used to own, but have looked for on CD and cannot find (the tunes evoke Chet Baker's style).  Despite the serious tone of the movie, you will find a scene toward the end hysterically funny, that of the married wife caught cheating by the husband in their bedroom with Seymour Cassel, and his attempt to evade the husband is classic and hilarious.

816470,5,6304192312,"John Cassavetes is widely regarded as the father of the Independent film, who believed that risking anything was the only way to go, who bluntly told Scorsese Boxcar Bertha ""sucked""  (Scorsese then turned and created Mean Streets), and treated his crew like family who he payed very little (or at all).  Whether or not Cassavetes is THE father of the Independent film is up to the film historians to decide.  Besides, John Cassavetes was not interested in making films to make history or be the strict anti-trend to the big budget nature of Hollywood.  John Cassavetes was interested in making films that give us truths about our lives, and he did so greatly, in a very different and low budget kind of nature that made his work seem even more honest.  John Cassavetes Face's is, among the rest of his work, the most well known of his films to enter the public domain, and for many reasons is probably the best Cassavetes work to start with, next to A Women Under the Influence (a very devastating work).

Shot in Cassavetes' trademark documentary style filmmaking, the no BS approach to filming makes Faces even more realistic to watch.  It is shot in high contrast black and white, and it look as low budget and unpolished as any other very low budget film.  Don't be too surprised though, Faces is no banal third rate student film work.  Cassavetes Oscar-nominated script effortlessly delves into the lives of these empty people and what makes them act the way they are.  It is not a sloppy film either, as Cassavetes's camera work is actually quite inventive, and feels done right without making a big hoopla over how it is being used.

Much of Faces will not be explained in this review, and I think part of this is that this film raises tough questions about our lives, many of them that are arguably subjective out of the objective. Rest assured if you are looking for a film that will raise questions about the boring lives that some of us have the potential to lead, then watch this film.  For even more insight into the film, I also recommend Cassavetes on Cassavetes, which is written by the leading scholar on Cassavetes, Ray Carney, who applies his own ""Pragmatic Anesthetic"" to the film.

Although previously sold in a bare bones DVD with no special features, the good folks at Criterion Collection will make sure that Cassavetes' works will be given the treatment they deserve.  Although sometimes Criterion Collection doesn't quite stock up on special features, this two disc set on Faces packs quite a lot of interesting features along with the film (which is a substantial length at over two hours).  You are getting your money's worth with this set, which includes insightful making into the film, an alternative opening,  as well as an insightful documentary about the man himself.  Since this is a great starting point, the inclusion of a introduction to Cassavetes himself is a very great addition.  This is the DVD to start with if you are looking into Cassavetes.  Thanks Criterion Collection!

A gusty and insightful look into the emptiness of the married middle age suburban demographic, Faces gets my high recommendation.",1276041600,10,3148,4.805194805194805

I know it is supposed to be ground-breaking, influential, a masterpiece, etcetera, but I just could not take the annoying characters any longer.  The first 20 minutes appeared to be some improvisational piece that had over-stayed its welcome.

816472,4,6304192312,"Faces, by John Cassavetes, is a 1968 film generally credited as being the first popular independent film in America to make an impact in the public consciousness. But, it is more than that. It is a film that totally subverted the dominant themes and forms of Hollywood cinema, at the time, showed that `adult' films, truly adult, not a euphemism for pornography, could have mass appeal, and paved the way for the great auteur decade of American filmmaking that was the 1970s. That things have regressed severely, since then, only shows how much a young Cassavetes is needed these days.
  But, it was totally different from the European auteur films of the 1960s, in that it eschewed symbolism, framing, and Post-Modern techniques of storytelling. Faces is a raw film that is laced with searing, realistic dialogue, and gives the impression that the viewer is truly eavesdropping on the private lives of people who could be them, for there are no Hollywood goddesses nor buff Adonises to be found in any scenes. And, unlike a master like Ingmar Bergman, who also focused on the inner emotional and psychological lives of individuals, Cassavetes' characters are not philosophizing nor posing in neatly framed boxes. This is not so much a criticism of the European poetic approach to film, merely to state that Cassavetes' style was far more revolutionary, and felt like actual cinema verit. In that sense, while one can argue ceaselessly over the relative excellence of certain directors, it is impossible to deny Cassavetes' importance in the pantheon of film's first century.
  Nor can one deny Faces' importance, at least as a landmark, if not having lasting influence in Hollywood's Lowest Common Denominator output. The film follows the demise of the fourteen year marriage of Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin), two LA suburban children of the post-World War Two boom, at the height of American affluence, just before Vietnam, Watergate, and the 1970s allowed the Conservative movement of the 1980s send standards of living into a spiral that has yet to stem. Why are they breaking up? We are never directly told. He's the head of a large company, and she a bored housewife, and while they still have things in common, and enjoy each other- as shown in a terrific scene of the couple in bed, laughing their heads off over lame jokes Richard tells, their marriage has just died. Neither could probably pinpoint where, much less why. But, the fact that they are still chuckling over the most inane jokes, just to please one another, says it all about most relationships- that they almost all end up as zombies. That's what makes this film so real, potent, and discomfiting. Contrast this to the Hollywood paradigm of the mid-1960s, Doris Day comedies, when the film was first started, and the difference is stark....But, the real stars of this film are the writing and acting. Cassavetes reaches Chekhovian heights of drama, admixed with Tennessee Williams' poetic realism, in his Oscar nominated Best Original Screenplay. It is truly among the greatest screenplays ever written, even if, as rumored, there was much improvisation in the dialogue. Here, for one of the few times on screen or stage, one gets to see the actor as creator, not merely collaborator. Lynn Carlin, in her first film role, is authentic as the clueless abandoned wife, and got an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress. Seymour Cassel, as he lover, is also fantastic, as a gigolo with a soft side, and also got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Gena Rowlands, as the prostitute, is neither victim nor saint, just a real person struggling with real problems, and gives her usual great performance, as one of the great actresses of all time in film. But, this film is dominated, from start to finish, by the towering performance of John Marley. How many of us have worked for a son of a bitch like him? How many women know a bastard like him? How many men reading this are a Richard Forst? The supporting actors- Fred Draper as Richard's drunken pal Freddie, Val Avery as the drunken Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, the old lady Chet deigns to kiss, when she drunkenly pleads for affection- are uniformly terrific, as well.
  The title of the film is based upon the notion that we all act in ways that are mere role playing for others, mere faces, and this has never been more true than in this film. A more apt title, though, might have been Personae, but since Bergman's singular Persona had recently been released, to great acclaim, this title suffices. No scene better and more aptly depicts why it suffices than in the terrific, nearly twenty minute opening scene, after the title sequence, which hints at the fact that, as Bergman was doing in that era, this film may all be a film some of the characters are watching, as a presentation to Forst as `the Dolce Vita of the commercial field.' That this meta-narrative aspect has not been commented on by many critics I find curious, but understandable, since no more than two or three minutes into the nearly twenty minutes that follow, we are given a bravura performance of drunkenness never before equaled, for its realism, onscreen. The strengths of this film are so many and so potent that things that in other films that would be weaknesses, such as fashions and dated slang, become strengths for this film has not dated. Its characters are as fresh as they were four decades ago, even if the film, itself, serves as a time capsule of the 1960s, yet one that is timeless.",1221091200,2,5542,4.834562697576396
816473,3,6304192312,"Faces (John Cassavettes, 1968)

I have to rank myself among those, having seen Faces, who understand its importance in the film world, but can't bring themselves to like the movie. I understand why Cassavettes did the things he did with this movie, why the film is supersaturated and the sound mix is awful and all the other little quirks that kept this so far away from Hollywood, and its subject matter is conceptually brilliant; the question one has to put to oneself is whether you're actually going to be able to sit through two hours plus of what is, essentially, boring and obnoxious cocktail-party banter, even after the cocktail party itself is long over.

The main characters in Faces are a married couple, Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin), who have found their marriage going stale, and in response, each flirts with the idea of finding a younger lover. The results of their dalliances, however, are anything but the pleasant no-strings-attached sex each was hoping for; in fact, the consequences are potentially disastrous.

It's a great idea, and I do like the way it's carried off, most of the time. Technically, it's a brilliant approach to the subject; Cassavettes gives us washed-out characters in a washed-out film, bending every aspect of the moviemaking process to the psyches of the people he's got in front of the camera.  And the script works right along with that premise; if you have washed-out characters in a washed-out film, what other sort of dialogue should they have saved washed out? Unfortunately, however, this has always been my problem with 'The Dead"", that short story of James Joyce's that everyone but me seems to love. My take on it is that Joyce was subscribing to the hypothesis ""if you want to write a story about boring people, write a boring story"". And the story certainly succeeds beyond any reasonable bounds in that regard, which I assume is why so many people like it. Similarly Faces; Cassavettes has done a fantastic job of it here, though substituting ""washed-out""  (I can't imagine anyone calling these folks ""boring""). And it's a deft and proficient depiction of the characters. It's the characters themselves that get on my nerves. ***",1212105600,,2212,4.919571045576408

People like me  who have watched other Cassavettes films know that they cannot expect an agreable entertainment. The direction is impecable, the acting outstanding but the story is so claustrophobic and tough that it 's difficult to digest.",1432684800,,553,5.571428571428571

7865748,5,6304192312,"This is the most remarkable American independent film ever made. It will change your life. It will alter the way you look at everything. John Cassavetes was a true genius and master of the medium. He is so untouchable and this film is so outstanding and miraculous that I feel guilty writing about it. The film is too good, too extraordinary to be written about on some website by some fan. As usual in a Cassavetes film, the acting is the best acting you have ever seen, will ever see, and could ever possibly imagine. Faces is a work of art and art is a work of faces, vice versa. It is a piece about bouncing emotions. It's about taking a feeling and seeing what happens when you toss it against the wall. It's about multitude and longevity, youth and frenzied weariness. Faces is about marriage and love, and whether or not life can be lived happily when faced with either one of them. Can a married man truly live his life without repose? Can a man wild with love actually be wild about the life that bore it? It is a film about moments. It is a film about the ides of the soul, and the crisis contained therein, proving that this film is about impotency, it is about the perpetual dilemma. It is about men and women and time and too much of it. It is about who we really are. It is about truth and examination. Intimacy and doubt in black and white. Faces is John Cassavetes's masterpiece, it is his gift to the world. A film that inspires, adapts, and transforms. Always.",1405382400,,1478,4.358695652173913
7865749,3,6304192312,I loved John Cassevettes film Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown so I wanted to see more of his films.  The story line of this movies was not as compelling.  It is about a middle aged couple who's marriage is not going well.  The husband is a successful businessman and the wife is a beautiful homemaker.  The movie depicts the husband and wife both reacting to tension in the marriage by going out on the town and seeking comfort in youthful strangers.,1402876800,,460,4.440476190476191
