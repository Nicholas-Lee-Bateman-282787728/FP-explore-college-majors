4703694,1,B005HS00WI,"The  lead actor was so out of shape and such a really! really! bad actor that we had a great time laughing at just how bad it was, like we were being punked!  The girl who is suppose to be in love with him doesn't recognize him when he comes back after a year (she thinks he is dead) even though as soon as he opens his mouth he sounds the same. All he did was shave.
 OMG & LOL Watch it till the end when he takes off his shirt with man boobs and beer belly...oh and the music score has to be stolen from a lifetime channel  movie, it is that sad.  Poor Tom Arnold at least he appears to know he's in a comedy. The worst movie but a good laugh because it is so bad. Watch it only if it's free!!!!!",1324857600,3,698,3.786206896551724

4703696,1,B005HS00WI,"Reasons to not waste one's time:
(1.) This Kiosk rental rating is less than one because it's not worth the dollar it cost to rent.
(2.) IMDB rating was 2.3 out of 10.
(3.) Most of the actors, writer and director have to their filmography credits either movies no one's ever heard of or lots of TV videos and shorts you've never heard of.
(4.) First 20 minutes consisted of some guy driving around and then getting out to then walk around with a cheap camera and take pictures. That's it.
(5.) The editing and cinematography were so bad I thought a high school student was practicing on creating a collage for art class. Poor editing, very choppy, no flow and when it did have flow it would barely beat out molasses flowing across a winter Canadian prairie.
(6.) Acting, was this artificial, e.g. stare at the person in front of you and read a line then camera pans to that person who reads their line, and back and forth ad nauseam. You would have sworn their was a teleprompter off screen. Also seeing that Tom Arnold was a main character, poor soul, didn't help.
(7.) Most parts of the story were just not believable: e.g. recently dug grave doesn't have grass above it and looks like the decades old surrounding grass; some guy is tossed into the ocean with feet and hands bound with heavy chains and head in a hood while his captors are still above him in a boat yet he manages to escape from them. Must be those fish gills we didn't see. Then for revenge he spends a year getting in shape, practicing martial arts and pistol range shooting to come back and kill dozen or so highly trained killers. Unfortunately he looked like the same skinny, beer belly non-athletic person that he was before the training. The worst part was seeing an equally middle aged out of shape Tom Arnold act like a Marine sharp shooter and nail three bad guys perfectly from a mile away. His most remarkable shot, for some unexplained reason, occurs when he's in a bumpy rent-a-copter with a very shaky rifle. Just laughable.
(8.) Overloaded with uncreative stereotypes such as inept police; crooked police; business that does some drug dealing on the side which supports the mansion of the son who wants to take over dad's business; cute blond girlfriend who works in the local pub; the usual few innocent people die (poorly explained reasons) as appetizers.",1321142400,,2341,4.6028708133971294
4703697,5,B005HS00WI,Good story line...bad wig. For a low budget film I would highly recommend it. It will keep you entertained and guessing throughout the movie,1320796800,3,140,4.875
4703698,5,B005HS00WI,"Why all the hate?  I found this a pretty entertaining independent film.  You can see lack of budget in a few areas, but still better then half the stuff you see in theaters nowadays.",1320796800,8,182,4.323529411764706
4703699,2,B005HS00WI,"""I liked him, I just can't believe he killed those people.""  After an insurance investigator is killed and blamed for a string of murders a writer comes into town to write a book on the events.  Talking to his girlfriend and his new neighbor he begins to uncover secrets that may lead to his innocence.  This movie seems better then it is.  The acting is passible...but with Tom Arnold giving the best performance that should help you with the quality involved.  Besides the performances the editing was very strange and seemed very choppy.  But all that aside this movie was very ordinary and kinda boring.  For an action movie this was not full of action and was rough to get through.  All that being said I have seen worse.  Overall, worth watching only if you love action movies more then any other genre.  I give it a C-.

4703700,2,B005HS00WI,"I had ordered this title since it was getting some major coverage in the distributor magazines, plus I am always looking for a director to finally get that break and make a good film (especially since his last three were so bad). And add into it that Monterey Media was giving it their listing, I went into this really wanting to like it...so with sad hesitation I must say this was a good looking film that in the end I could barely watch.

The story follows an author as he pursues big city corruption and a simultaneous murder frame of his good (and now dead) buddy. Tom Arnold plays the comic relief/sniper neighbor, Mena Suvari the hot girlfriend (highlight of the movie) and several other recognizable faces in forgettable roles.

I really do not want to harp on this too much as I support independent film wholeheartedly, but when the acting, writing, cheesy lines, pulled punches and no-way moments keep getting thrown at you in almost every sequence - you almost want to give up. I made it to that clichd and moronic ending, hoping to then find some redemption in the one supplement. The making-of is a 20-minute director's commentary on top of irritating handheld behind the scenes footage. So you do get to hear about how the film was made but I prefer to get that in an actual commentary. The fly-on-the-wall filming of several scenes would have been more fun to watch if you could hear what was going on instead of the director droning.

The video clarity is outstanding and they obviously had some nice cameras to work with, but the sound was dubbed so poorly at times it became laughable (really bad punching sounds, dialogue blatantly not matching the actor's mouth, made-for-TV-score music, etc). The 5.1 was intermittent, region 1 coded, rated R for violence and one bedroom scene. I cannot recommend it, but if you are looking for a light Sunday evening rental to see one of your favorite actors that might be in this, I am sure the disappointment won't be that bad...but this really felt like a thrown together crime farce. One star for the film clarity and one for Suvari.",1320537600,,2093,4.666666666666667

4703943,1,B005HS00WI,"BAd movie in so many ways.  Sometimes movies are so bad they are still entertaining this one is in the middle:
Plot holes: You have cars blowing up, people being shot in broad daylight and no police or anyone seems to notice.
Mistakes: Way too many to mention but one that even Stevie Wonder could have seen.  Hero gets shot in the shoulder, end of the movie he is shirtless, no wound in his shoulder!

If you like really crappy formula, predictible movies with extreme stereotypical characters this is your film.  They don't even have to have names, just Hero Guy, Hot bartender girl, crooked/mean cop, Rich OlD business man, Out of Control son of Rich Old Business Man.  Drunk,stupid guy in Bar, over-the-top funny, creepy, end up lovable neighbor guy.................Add in the poor filming (the fight scenes look like scenes from an 8th grade play).
Any person who reviews this and says: great movie, still thinks Ed Wood movies were intellectual.

4703946,4,B005HS00WI,"Recently I watched the Postman Always Rings Twice.  A classic thriller but flawed.  I believe this is as good a film as that classic film in many ways.  The main character looks pretty shaggy for a reason as later in the film when he is reborn he isn't recognized as his former self even by his short lived girlfriend.  I didn't recognize him either.  I'm not sure but I think his nose was longer and wider before he shaved his beard off and cut his hair short.

The main character is supposed to be doing work for a lawyer who hired him to video tape people suspected of insurance fraud.  But the real purpose is to frame him for their murders and edit his video to include scenes of the people dieing so it appears he taped his victims while he murdered them.  The video tape is in the hands of the police and when he disappears he is considered the killer without ever having been tried for the crime.

But the real murderers dump him into the lake with his hands and feet in chains and he managed to escape.  We don't find that out until close to the end of the film when he reveals himself to us.

Tom Arnold's character is a little over the top for a former marine sniper who lives next door to the writer who rents the condo for the summer.  The writer is the friend of the accused missing murderer he said and he is investigating the crimes his friend was accused of commiting.  The closer he looks the more danger he is in and people began to die when they speak to him.  The writer turns out to be the man who was framed.

The final scenes are our hero killing the bad guys and revealing the truth about drug smuggling, murder and why he was framed for the murders all the while freeing the former girlfriend held hostage.

We have a drug smuggling son of a rich man and a host of conspirators including a doctor, and two dirty police detectives.  The main problems I have with the film are that the girlfriend wouldn't recognize her former lover's voice.  One thing he can't disguise is his voice.  The other is where did a down and out man accused of murder acquire so much money in just a year if he is forced to use a false identity and hiding from the police.  He's loaded with cash.  Lastly, how can Tom Arnold afford to live so well in such a nice condo?  There is no mention of him ever working or having any source of income.  But he drives a high powered car and lives well.  No explanation is needed for us I guess.

The final shootout in an expensive home and neighborhood brings a sole corrupt detective when the silent alarm goes off.  But often a security company would notify the police of a silent alarm and then patrol officers would answer the call, not a detective.  He wouldn't even be aware unless someone called him privately.  Then Tom Arnold saves our hero by shooting the bad guy from an FBI helicopter with a sniper rifle but the amount of time it took for him to line up the shot our hero would already be dead.

With a few minor tweeks this could have been a far better film.

Movies like the Count of Monte Cristo where a man is seeking revenge is also a good story but with some better twists and a character who changes his appearance to keep people from recognizing who he is.  But his former lover does recognize him in that story in spite of his disguise.",1361145600,5,3300,4.257234726688103
4703947,4,B005HS00WI,"I love films that are so bad, they are hilarious to watch....  This one was unbelievably bad.  I'd put it up there with Showgirls and The Room.",1353283200,,143,4.2592592592592595
4703948,3,B005HS00WI,"This makes a great movie...if you are Lois Lane or blind. The film starts out with insurance investigator Brian Spikes. After they build up his character, he is murdered and blamed for the murders of all the people he was investigating. Later Alex shows up to investigate the murders for a true crime novel. Tom Arnold plays the neighbor and gives us the needed comic relief. Mena Suvari is a bar tender who supplied the eye candy.

The film twist wasn't difficult to figure out. In fact shame on you if you don't. It was a fair crime detective movie that moved slowly. Most of the film was a drama as opposed to the thriller it pretends to be.

The movie/video did have a low budget and did have a simple story line, but it had lots of actions and a few surprise twists. I like Tom Arnold playing a differnt type of character and the ending made things turn out right and I enjoy that. All in all I found it a very good movie to watch and not so complex that I had trouble trying to understand what was going on. I also enjoyed how he played Nocturne in E flat at the end so his love interest would know ""he"" lived. I did miss how he got all that money to spend but buy or rent but do watch this movie.",1332115200,,618,3.8661417322834644
4703950,1,B005HS00WI,"This movie is really cheesy! I can't believe a movie with such a bad storyline was able to afford relatively big-time actors like C. Thomas Howell and Tom Arnold. However, I've never seen the actor before who plays the lead role, and he definitely does NOT look like a tough guy action hero...come on! At the end of the movie he brags, ""I got into shape""...standing there on the beach with a soft physique and a big gut, and no tan whatsoever. In the first half of the movie, he looks like a bum on the street, and in the second half, he looks like a computer geek. And this hot chick bartender who can get any guy she wants is all over him in both versions of his appearance? Yeah, right. So he can play Nocturne in E flat--big deal. That's about the easiest Chopin piano piece there is! LOL
