8673344,5,B00MNTGH8A,"This is a German film with subtitles and is based on a 1930 European court case. Veras perfect life is ruined by a womanizing concert pianist. She kills him, and the rest of movie presents the backstory, her trial, and her motives. This film is fascinating from beginning to end. Gripping drama with an emotional performance by Pola Negri.
