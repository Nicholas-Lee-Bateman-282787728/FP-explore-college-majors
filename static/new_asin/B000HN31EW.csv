2639453,5,B000HN31EW,"I never write reviews, but ""Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go To College"" is most deserving of one. This movie is what dreams are made of: bad acting, bad puns, talking puppets, pranks a-plenty (which they call ""yanks""), and just a dash of nudity. Oh, and let's not forget the buffoon-ish campus police officer who steals the show with physical comedy good enough to rival Chaplin himself. So, if you're in the mood for a movie that semi-borrows from almost every college-set comedy made before 1990, and throws in 3 puppets who speak in yiddish, puns, and vague Three-Stooges-isms, then buy/rent this today and gather some buddies and beers and be prepared to be wowed.",1403222400,3,660,4.849557522123894
2639454,2,B000HN31EW,The series peaked with Ghoulies 2 in my opinion. This is more of horror comedy but unfortunately I didn't find it funny.,1383350400,,120,4.5
2639455,5,B000HN31EW,"The wait is finally over, fellow yankers.  We've waited long enough and our patience has been amply rewarded.  ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College"" has been remastered and rereleased!

With stellar performances from an all-star cast including (but not limited to) Thom Adcox (""Disney's Gargoyles""), Matthew Lillard (""Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated""), Marcia Wallace (""The Simpsons""), Kane Hodder (""Jason X"") and Richard Kind (""Spin City""), ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College"" is a non-stop cavalcade of talent.  You never know who'll show up next.

For the first time in the long-running, highly acclaimed ""Ghoulies"" film series, the titular creatures are given the opportunity to speak.  This was a major step forward in the ongoing evolution of their characters, as we were finally given the chance to understand their motivations; why they do what they do and how they reflect upon their lot in life.  You sympathize with their plight as unwilling servants to a dark master and appreciate the craft of their dialogue as they soliliquize their passions and their frustrations.  If it weren't for this progression of their character arc, you'd have never known when Rat Ghoulie was ""sporting half a chubby"" or when Fish Ghoulie felt it necessary to ""blow this poop stand"".

For years, fans of the Ghoulies franchise (""yankers"") were forced to endure a mocking, unsightly hole in their collection, as ""Ghoulies"", ""Ghoulies II"" and ""Ghoulies IV"" had all been released on DVD... but not ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College"".  This was especially infuriating and disheartening considering, as stated in the above paragraph, ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College"" is an essential chapter in the ongoing story arc of the Ghoulies.  You can't follow the narrative of the 4-part epic without this vital installment.

So, I say to all my fellow yankers, now is the time to rejoice.  Not only is ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College"" available to a new generation of yankers and potential-yankers, but it has been remastered in a (quite frankly) STUNNING high definition.  The special effects have never looked more vibrant.  You can finally make out the hands of the puppeteers as they bounce in and out of the bottom of the frame; just as director John Carl Buechler originally intended.

And the special bonus features are a real labor of love.  There's scene selection so I can jump straight to all the highlights (though really, the entire film is one big highlight) and that's only the tip of the iceberg.  I was especially impressed with how the closed captioning was in English.

So yank away, fellow yankers and don't forget to clap it, slap it and wrap it!  Your Ghoulies collection is at last complete!",1370995200,6,2714,5.06981981981982
2639456,3,B000HN31EW,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and enjoying it immensely. I was excited to revisit it after all these years. Obviously it wasn't the same experience but still wasn't bad. You have to take the film for what it is. You may dig it; you may not. I wouldn't mind watching it again some day. Hopefully, I won't feel any different about it.",1368748800,,352,4.348484848484849

8140551,3,B000HN31EW,"Higher education has never been this low-brow! In the third entry of the unlikely ""Ghoulies"" franchise, the titular characters (or to be more accurate, slime puppets) head to college. It's ""Troll"" by way of ""Animal House"" in ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College.""

John Carl Buechler, the ""Troll"" director and special effects maestro whose name keen credit-viewers will recognize from many iconic '80s horror films, steps behind the camera once more for this obvious video store filler. What sets ""Ghoulies III"" apart from ""Ghoulies"" past is not only its off-the-wall sense of humor but also the fact that the Ghoulies actually speak in this film. Not only that, but those who were entranced by the original film's toilet-centric VHS art but disappointed by the film itself will be pleased to find this installment more than lives up to the promise of that truly hilarious yet frightening image. This one'll get you, in the end!

There's nothing intelligent or particularly inventive going on with this film. Just three foul-mouthed, Stooge-esque muppets from hell running amok. And when it's 1:00 in the morning and you just can't sleep, what else do you want? Well, how about a really good cast that probably deserves more but doesn't appear to be looking down on the material (or the paycheck)? Kevin McCarthy is more than game as the story's main villain, while the beautiful Eva LaRue gives you something pleasant to look at, in sharp contrast to our lead characters. Also on deck is Stephen Lee (from ""Dolls"") as the unfortunate head of security. Also, be on the lookout for a young Matthew Lillard in his first film role. ""Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College"" is stupid, but it's a special kind of stupid. Chances are, if you've stumbled across it, you need to see it for yourself. Don't flush this one just yet.",1513468800,,1821,4.889967637540453
8140552,1,B000HN31EW,"This movie is not worth your time or money.  I assumed it would be so bad it that would funny, but no this movie is just plan bad. The movie left me wanting my money and the hour and a half of my life I spent watching it back. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. A an early nineties horror movie expected it the normal boob shot however this movie wasted time with over the top awkwardly placed sex scene that took place on an exercise bike that, the scene went on for way too long.  Nothing fun about the movie the over all story line was weak and not very entertaining.",1498953600,,579,4.0701754385964914

GHOULIES GO TO COLLEGE

I am a huge fan of the Ghoulies, the creatures of course. The films range from classic to horrible with this one falling in between. Back in my younger days I would rent these VHS tapes all of the time from the video store. This one leaves behind the horror for the comedy and college humor at that. We get all of the crude humor that would come with along with some slapstick. Not the best of the series but not the worst, heres looking at you four.

A professor at the college is tired of the prank wars going on at the school. There are two frats in particular that are going for the crown. So when the professor comes across a way he can summon the demons know as the Ghoulies he does, by way of comic book. Once there he sends them out on their mission to takes these kids out.

This was the first movie in the series that had the Ghoulies actually speaking, yes they talk here. At first I didn't like that about this movie but it grew on me. Their humor is stupid but I kinda like that now, especially on a boring day. This was also Matthew Lillards film debut and Jason Scott Lee is here as well among many other faces I am sure you all know.

Director John Carl Buechler who you may know as the guy behind Troll, Cellar Dweller, Friday the 13th 7, among many others did a great job with what they went for here. Credit for that should also go to writer Brent Olson. I really wish that the DVD came with a commentary from those two, which would have been excellent. Over all if you like goofy comedy then this is for you.",1437609600,,1563,4.131578947368421
