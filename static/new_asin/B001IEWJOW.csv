8310850,5,B001IEWJOW,"Murder Investigation Team (M.I.T.)first aired in 2003, and ran for eight episodes. After a two year hiatus, it resurfaced with various cast changes, in 2005. The 2005 incarnation ran for four episodes. Unfortunately, the second run wasn't quite the same without Samantha Spiro (in my opinion).

I found the first eight episodes extremely well acted and believable - quite a change from the crime dramas in the USA. MIT provides an emphasis on real police work and human drama, rather than far fetched ""super science."" For me, it was extremely refreshing to see actual detective work, conducted with current techniques and procedures. The two female leads are delightful, and Samantha Spiro is quite credible as Detective Constable Vivian Friend. She's smart, and has a commanding presence that demands the utmost respect and professionalism from her colleagues and subordinates. She's the boss of the team, and runs a tight organization.

If you like police drama, and would like to see something a bit more plausible and interesting, check out this series. I only have one reservation, and that regards the use of language - American ears may have a difficult time parsing the English accents, but the series is definitely worth it.",1326499200,,1233,5.129353233830845
