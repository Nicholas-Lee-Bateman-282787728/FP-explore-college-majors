8682751,3,B00O9ZSLZ8,"Yeah - I agree with other comments here: The program gives a really good description of what went into this project. It was fantastic. But, they just stop at the most crucial moment: They stop the show just before landing!!! I don't think they should have put out this DVD until after the landing. Here is a link to the project highlights on the European Space Agency's web page:

The lander did land successfully.",1446854400,,492,5.573333333333333

8682753,2,B00O9ZSLZ8,This movie will leave you lost in space wondering what ever happened because they stopped the film before the probe actually landed on the comet.  Did they forget to put the second DVD in the box or what!  Pass on this one unless you're looking for a movie with no conclusion.  Should have been half price because it was only half a movie.,1430524800,2,339,4.349206349206349
8682754,5,B00O9ZSLZ8,"How do you land on anything which is traveling at 41,000 MPH, while every second, tons of gas, ice and dust erupts from its surface

Well, the simple answer is build a beauty called Rosetta and hope that you can get it land on a comet called 67P/CG. But wait a minute, not only I do not know what a comet is, those guys who are trying to make whatever it is which is suppose to land on a comet, not only have never made any machine like that, they have no knowledge of the substance of a comet, less alone a moving comet in space where that by itself is a huge unknown as well. I am not a science buff and could care less for animation either, but if these geniuses spent thirty years to achieve such task, it deserves fifty minutes of my time. By the way, as I said, majority of the presentation is animation so unfortunately they, in this case European Science Agency (ESA) have not achieved landing their machine called Rosetta on any comet yet, but they are only hoping and trying. One more thing, a comet has some 100,000 times less gravitational pull than Planet Earths, meaning that you could fall off a comet surface very easily into the space due to hardly any gravity at all, so imagine securing a machine on a comet remotely from Planet Earth. With a $1.7 billion dollar investment by ESA, Rosetta at 180 feet wide with solar panels on each side, cameras with only 4 megapixels since Rosetta was built some ten years ago, has been in a deep sleep, let's say some kind of a hibernation, some 341 million miles from Planet Earth in space for thirty one months. Now, choosing a comet like 67P/CG and a landing spot is another whole other issue. ESA chose comet 67P/CG, a two and half mile wide left over comet from the birth of solar system where Rosetta had to push its limits to travel and reach, is some 500 million miles away from the sun, a serious distance from the sun since the further you go, the less sunlight you get and for Rosetta where it gets its juice from its solar panels located on either side of Rosetta is a serious issue. If Rosetta gets to land its baby called Philae which is equipped with enough technology to anchor itself to a comet, any comet successfully, I meant more like hopefully on comet 67P/CG and get to analyze the amino acids of 67P/CG which is what comet may be made of possibly, then we may have some answers to humans existence on Planet Earth which all started some 3.8 billion years ago unknowingly and surprisingly.

P.S. This whole documentary is so exciting and so informative that I even forgot I was watching some space science. I was glued to it more than I have been glued to any of my favorite 007 movies and two things kept coming to me during the fifty five minutes of the whole documentary. First and foremost, how admiring it is to see so many intelligent human specie working so closely with each other from different nationalities where the qualification is to use their brains in achieving the unachievable. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Second, not as important as the first but yet extremely noticeable to me watching that Rosetta's solar panels which is the only way to get energy during the whole documentary with its 180 feet solar panels How could these engineers create some solar panels that were functional in space some 500 million miles away from the sun, where the sunlight is only some four percent of its full force, some ten years ago, but our politicians were not successful in investing the tax payer's money just few years ago. They wasted few hundred million dollars of our tax payers dollars while only some crooks related to some officials ended up stealing the funds and they all came to that conclusion that solar energy is a dead energy as it was when god bless his intelligence, that other peanut farmer who said some forty years ago that solar energy was the solution to our energy problems when he was no scientist to start with. Our politicians are truly nothing but disgrace, an absolute disgrace where they really cannot accomplish anything other than feeding their friends and the corrupt system that they associate themselves with. Disturbing, disturbing, disturbing, since watching this documentary is a proof that our politicians not only do not accomplish anything decade after decade, no wonder Planet Earth is suffering more and more since majority do not care at all. These scientists at least bring some excitement for the few dollars that they get to raise. Koch Brothers are a practical failure in getting recognition during their lifetime, someone got to get a copy to them since all their funding has got them no human recognition or a single positive result and worse yet, they have not improved Planet Earth or any human's life at all. At least they can take their billion dollar funding for 2016 presidential election and give it to Rosetta and call it Koch-Rosetta and get to revive solar energy once again. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1425513600,3,4938,4.603859250851305
8682755,3,B00O9ZSLZ8,"Generally good except for a very major disappointment.  The movie comes to a complete stop just before they attempt to land the space probe.  They never explain why or make any attempt to show why they cut off the movie.  They just stop, leaving you hanging.  As usual, they use a lot of repititious clips throughout thhe presentation probably just to fill in time.  The title of the documentary movie is just what they claim it to be, ""To Chase a Comet"", not ""To Catch a Comet"".",1424476800,4,479,4.459770114942529
8682756,5,B00O9ZSLZ8,I watched this on PBS the other night ... how thrilling ... I will get the DVD when it is released In Jan 2015....,1416528000,,114,3.7916666666666665
