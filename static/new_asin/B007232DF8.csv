5049480,5,B007232DF8,Amongst so many western movies it's always wonderful to view something that does not follow the traditionally established scripts that never seem to deviate from hundreds of established norms.  The authors certainly brought forth a scenario that holds the attention of the viewer.,1352246400,13,280,5.511627906976744
5049481,5,B007232DF8,"Ever since first seeing it many years ago, THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY has cast its melancholy spell over me. Therefore, I was delighted when a made-on-demand DVD became available from MGM.

Robert Mitchum plays ""the assassin, the murderer, the pistolero, Martin Brady"", a hired gun for the ruthless Castro brothers in northern Mexico. Weary of what he has become in their service, and being a wanted man north of the Rio Grande, he is a man between two countries. Circumstances soon make his situation even more dangerous.

Mitchum is excellent, as is the entire cast. Julie London is impressive as the woman(trapped in her own desperation)Brady falls in love with. The familiar faces of Gary Merrill, Albert Dekker, Charles McGraw, Jack Oakie, Jay Novello, and Pedro Armendariz & Victor Mendoza as the Castros, round out the superb cast. Satchel Paige as a cavalry sergeant has his moments too.

The direction of Robert Parish, beautiful cinematography of the Durango locations, and a note perfect score by Alex North make this an unforgetable film. Anyone who has ever seen it will likely remember Mitchum's last line - ""Lagrimas, a horse called tears"".

Presented in its original aspect ratio of 1:66 to 1, the picture quality is good throughout. No special features are provided on the disc. It's wonderful to finally have this unfairly neglected Western masterpiece on DVD.",1334016000,39,1373,5.088888888888889
5049482,4,B007232DF8,"This picture gives executive-producer Mitchum a chance to bring film noir sensibilities to a Tex-Mex Western, and it works just fine thanks to fine craftsmenship both in front and behind the camera.  An outstanding supporting cast really gives this one a boost.  Floyd Crosby and Alex Phillips offer up some terrific location photography, and Alex North provides a rich musical background.  Robert Parrish directs with customary skill.
The DVD-R provides a nicely saturated, anamorphic presentation at the correct 1:66 to 1 ratio.  The sound is 2.0 monophonic.  Grain structure and image sharpening are evident, but the presentation is a fine one for a film that mostly surfaces only on TCM.  There is a non-anamorphic, region-2 Spanish dvd that can now be considered obsolete.  Fans of this film should be happy with this release.",1330560000,38,831,5.203007518796992
5049483,5,B007232DF8,Wonderful movie; Mitchum was one of the best actors and the part he plays in this movie brings out all of his great talent.  The wonderful country is the USA.  Gives good insight into the Mexican thought process and how screwed up Mexico has always been to this day (5/27/2016).  Most people do not realize that Mexico has been a communist country since around 1917.,1464307200,,366,4.6
5049484,2,B007232DF8,Its a Mitchum movie so it can't be too bad....but it wasn't one of his best..lacking somehow.,1464048000,,93,4.529411764705882
5049485,4,B007232DF8,"While slow in many parts, the film is ok, especially because of Mitchum who is almost always good. He plays a man who killed a man who had killed his father. He was a boy at the time. He became so frightened that he ran and fled to Mexico. There he became a gunman and worked for a despicable man and his even more despicable brother. His job when the film opens is to bring guns to the US and sell them, but the guns are stolen. We do not know who did it. His employer blames him despite he being in bed at the time with a broken leg.
He meets a woman who is the wife of the commander of troops in Texas. She does not like her husband and wants to leave. Mitchum and her fall in love. He more than she.
A man tries to kill him and he shoots first. Then he runs again back to Mexico where his prior employer wants him to kill someone. Will he do so? The wife said she will only join him if he gives up his guns and settles in the US. Will he do so?",1463961600,,948,3.792929292929293
5049486,5,B007232DF8,"Great western
Loved how well it was shot and after so many years still looked really good.
It was a great story line, the American stuck down in Mexico because of his past. Now he falls in love with a American
woman and wants to be with her, but has to come back to the US to do that.
Buy the movie and see what happens.",1457481600,,320,3.8636363636363638

5049489,3,B007232DF8,"Interesting movie because of the cast, the scenery, and the music.  The plot is thin and uninteresting; too much screen time was spent on trivial matters, and the big themes were given so little time as to be uninteresting.  Although Robert Mitchum was a commanding screen presence, his performance in this film was below standard.",1452816000,,331,5.0

5049491,4,B007232DF8,"In my many decades of watching movies, there are a very few films that I wished were longer.  THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY is one of those films.

Although Ive never read it, I assume that Tom Leas novel upon which  THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY is based is epic in its nature.  Unfortunately, particularly in its second half, the 1959 adaptation by Robert Ardrey plays like a sketchy cliff notes edition of the story.  Character motivations are absent, key events occur off-screen and action sequences, though well staged, seem perfunctory.  Perhaps with another twenty or thirty minutes of running time (and a more probing screenplay), those issues would have been negligible.

Thats not to say that  THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY, directed by Robert Parrish, isn't an entertaining movie.  Set against exquisitely photographed Mexican landscapes, the film is more of a character study and a romantic drama, rather than an action Western.  Indeed, it is almost halfway through the picture before the first shot is fired.

Robert Mitchum, in top form, plays an American hired gun, who has worked for the corrupt Castro Brothers in Mexico since, as a teen, he fled his country after killing the man who murdered his father.  Now, on a mission for his employers, he journeys back across the border, but when a tumbleweed frightens his horse, he falls and breaks his leg.  This keeps him incapacitated on the U.S. side of the border for two months.  During that time he not only learns from Texas Ranger captain Albert Dekker that he was never wanted for avenging his fathers murder, but he also becomes attracted to Julie London, the wife of the Army post commander (Gary Merrill).

Another killing sends Mitchum back to Mexico where he is now forced to deal with political court intrigues involving the Castro Brothers.

Though many of their roles are underwritten,  THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY has a fine supporting cast that includes Jack Oakie,  Pedro Armendariz, Charles McGraw and Leroy Satchel Paige.  Alex North composed the rich music score.

Available on Blu-ray from Kino Lorber.

5049504,5,B007232DF8,"Robert Mitchum put his own money into this film rendition of Tom Lea's famed novel. Not a shoot 'em up, but a character study of a man who lives by the gun in Mexico, mistakenly believing his Mexican patron accepts him as an equal. Rejected by Texans as a Mexican and by Mexicans as a gringo, he is a man without a country. He falls in love with a cavalry officer's wife, played with a stone-faced lack of passion by Julie London. London complained when the film was released all of her scenes were cut. Good thing. She's terrible here. Mitchum was criticized for not speaking Spanish in the scenes in which he was in Mexico, opting for a Mexican accent whilst speaking English. A very good Western, far better than the credit it was not given at the time of its release.",1422748800,3,771,4.398601398601398

5049513,5,B007232DF8,"Great book by Tom Lea - famous artist, especially for his paintings of World War Two - in particular the fantastic ""Two Thousand Yard Stare"" portrait of a Marine who has been in combat and seen hell. An absolutely superb film.  Characters, plot, action, photography, glorious widescreen color, rich soundtrack that amplifies what you see. Stays fairly close to the book -- to film the story in detail from the novel would require a way-longer film. If you read the novel, you will know where is the wonderful country.  If you watch the advertisement trailer for this film, you will probably get the impression that the wonderful country is Mexico and its beautiful landscapes.  The film shows you at the end:  Martin Brady is headed to leave Mexico and swim across the Rio Grande to the real ""wonderful country.""",1382313600,,812,4.820143884892087
5049514,2,B007232DF8,"Robert Mitchum is an excellent actor, but not even his work can save this film. The movie's plot is contrived, and in places, nonsensical! It's a story based in Texas and Mexico, and Mitcum's accent leaves much to be desired. I like westerns and I like Robert Mitchum, but I cannot recommend this movie.",1371254400,3,303,4.62962962962963
5049515,4,B007232DF8,"Being good at what one does carries one disadvantage -- too many demands are made. This is the fate of Mitchum's character  Martin  Brady, a gunslinger sought out by a powerful Mexican family, Texas Ranger captain, and U.S. Army major. Misadventures cause him to bounce back and forth across the border with disastrous results because everyone wants a piece of him. The ending is an exclamation point to Brady's change of heart.
Gary Merrill and Julie London are convincing as estranged Army couple, as are Pedro Armendariz as a Mexican governor and Albert Dekker as unflappable Texas Ranger.",1370476800,2,592,5.030612244897959

5049519,5,B007232DF8,"Robert Mitchum is perfect for the role of the American pistolero working for a powerful Mexican
family.  The story is a fascinating account of how an American who fled across the border returns
to find that his earlier transgression as a young boy no longer prevent him from staying in the
United States, and serving as a Texas Ranger.  However, the story is deeper than it seems because
it is filled with different messages about love, loyalty, and discrimination.  The way Mitchum
mouths the term ""Gringo"" to Gary Merrill connotes the dislike Mexicans have for ugly Americans.
This is an overlooked film that requires careful attention to the rich texture of the images and
colors that divide cultures and people.  It is also an engaging film in which Mitchum's acting
reveals the way a man wrestles with identity, loyalty, and love before making a decision on who
he is.",1361664000,19,873,4.8389261744966445

Made at the point in the 50s where the genre had run out of steam, this plodding offering cant be save by even the likes of my fave Robert Mitchum nor the presence of leading lady Julie London (to me, the most under used stunner from that era).

The plot meanders an awful lot and the trite dialogue overshadows what little action there is. For a better western from that period also shot on Mexican locales I would recommend instead Robert Aldrichs  Vera Cruz.",1497052800,,603,4.522935779816514

8508728,5,B007232DF8,"With all due to respect to Eddie Coyle, Max Cady, Jim Flagg, JP Hara and the preacher in Night of the Hunter, Martin Brady may be my favorite Robert Mitchum performance. A tortured, lonely expatriate gunslinger, loyal to people who treat him like dirt, in love with a woman he can't have, so long in Mexico he speaks English with an accent, a man whose every turn leads to misfortune but who is still tough and formidable and not to be crossed (Well, he IS Robert Mitchum after all). And with his scruffy beard and poncho and big Mexican sombrero, he's like some dry run for the Man With No Name.  This is slower than I remember from when I last saw it (then again it was over 40 years ago and everything is faster these days) and most of the action scenes are nothing special, but it's beautifully shot and it's always great to see Mitchum on a horse, especially an Andalusian stallion named ""Tears"".  It's also nice to see Julie London, even if she does have the damnedest false eyelashes for a 19th Century cavalry wife.",1485993600,,1023,4.4361702127659575
8508729,5,B007232DF8,"Mitchum always gives a nice performance. Personally I like him better in war or gangster type movies which brings out his more animal instincts. He has done some good westerns though but this one was more timid for my liking. I still gave it 5 stars as I'm always a Mitchum fan. Not one of his better films but it was different for him to perform in. This guy had a persona,  which I believe was great in whatever he did. Die hard fans of Mitchum will still like this movie.",1481068800,,474,4.208791208791209
