8761190,5,B01FQD4CGS,"At first I was uncomfortable with buying this. But I'm glad I did. User interface upon startup up the DVD is very basic. And you have to change language to Japanese with English subtitles. The DVD Package can hold 4 disks but only comes with 2. Quality is great when I tried it on my Ps4. Also isn't regional locked thankfully.
I also requested a tracking number from the seller but your mileage may very with that because of USPS international shipping. But did arrive around 10 days from the expected 14 days.

I will update this review with photos latter on.",1472601600,2,565,4.495145631067961
