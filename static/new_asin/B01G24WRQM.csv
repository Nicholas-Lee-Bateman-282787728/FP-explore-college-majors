8762048,2,B01G24WRQM,As soon as I realized it was not in English I turned it off. The 2 stars are only because I had to click on a rating to leave this mesage.,1481328000,,138,3.4838709677419355
8762049,1,B01G24WRQM,"I seldom just give up watching a movie before it's over, but this one made me do it. The story is trite and uninteresting, the acting is poor. The most annoying thing is the poor sound quality that just makes it seem cheap and amateurish.",1479081600,3,238,4.311111111111111
8762050,2,B01G24WRQM,"Poor story, acting and production. Low budget and it showed. I tried hard to find something good about but I wasted my time watching it.",1478995200,,136,4.48
8762051,3,B01G24WRQM,"It was ok. The quality, camera used etc., was low budget..but the story line was kind of interesting. There were only about 3 actors who were good actors. The actual producer also was a character.. the crazy lady next door and she was probably the best actor in it..and also the boyfriend was pretty good, as well.",1478908800,,314,4.526315789473684

8762053,3,B01G24WRQM,"Interesting characters, with good acting skills. Antonio comes across as super-menacing, and Isabella as someone torn between love and a safe life. Unfortunately, I found the script disjointed and confusing. Too much talk and very little action. Ultimately, this makes for a boring movie. 2 1/2 stars",1477958400,,300,5.404255319148936

8762055,5,B01G24WRQM,"I had a chance to see this movie at the GIIFF film festival in Venice this past weekend. Really great, and I just ordered it on DVD. Trina McGee is a co-star in a really different, spooky role, but she also directed it. The sexy dangerous romance gone bad storyline combines with a mystery, a mysterious curandera, and a great theme about a young woman taking charge of her life.  Definitely see this movie.",1465171200,6,407,4.5
