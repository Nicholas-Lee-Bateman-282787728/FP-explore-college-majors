3145629,5,B0015L7RSG,"I always remember Saturday night Chiller went I was a kid growing up and how my sister and I would love watching it.  Sometimes the movies were too scary for me because I was about 5 when I started watching them.

This show came on Nickelodeon when my kids were small. At first I thought it may be a little too scary for my youngest but he was okay with it.  It starts out with a group of kids telling ghost stories around a campfire.  Each week one of the kids has to tell a new story.  When the kid starts the story the show begins.

Are You Afraid of the Dark? knows its audience and manages to blend the right amount of scary, the right amount of funny, and the right amount of silly to make a prefect family ""horror night"" program.

The Tale of Laughing in the Dark

The Tale of the Midnight Madness",1375401600,,823,4.09375

The problem with these releases is that they're out of order. And when I say out of order, they are completely random from all 6 seasons...

I don't mind if they decides to release them in volumes, but I just wish that they would have released them in order and by season. Almost seems like a cheat really.",1371081600,14,460,4.411764705882353

3380126,5,B0015L7RSG,"I always remember Saturday night Chiller went I was a kid growing up and how my sister and I would love watching it.  Sometimes the movies were too scary for me because I was about 5 when I started watching them.

This show came on Nickelodeon when my kids were small. At first I thought it may be a little too scary for my youngest but he was okay with it.  It starts out with a group of kids telling ghost stories around a campfire.  Each week one of the kids has to tell a new story.  When the kid starts the story the show begins.

Are You Afraid of the Dark? knows its audience and manages to blend the right amount of scary, the right amount of funny, and the right amount of silly to make a prefect family ""horror night"" program.

The Tale of Laughing in the Dark

The Tale of the Midnight Madness",1375401600,,823,4.09375
