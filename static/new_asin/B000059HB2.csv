I have owned the VHS version of this documentary since I was eleven years old and when I saw it came out on DVD I thought that was great because my tape was beginning to wear out. Let's just say I'm SO glad I decided to hold onto the VHS because the DVD is definitely not a direct copy of the VHS. I never read the packaging until way later on and discovered that the DVD is 55 minutes long - while the VHS was 88 or 90 (I can't remember exactly offhand). After watching the DVD through once, though, I recognized particular scenes were missing, such as a brief piece on the band's ""People Like Us"" album, as well as John Phillips' solo album, ""Wolf King of L.A."" I sent an e-mail to the company that released the DVD (an Australian company called DVDz)inquiring as to why this great documentary was butchered is such a way, but as of yet I have not recieved a response.

Basically my advice to anyone looking to buy this DVD would be to track down a copy of the VHS tape instead, because that will give you the truest information.",1155340800,5,1104,4.232227488151659

It's all interviews with 20 second bursts of their music, every now and then.
If you are a Fan and love watching The Mamas & Papas interviews then this is for you.
If you are after their Music plus Video Clips then don't buy this DVD as there is NO music clips on it!!!!!",1073088000,27,326,4.109375
8313130,3,B000059HB2,"Well, to start with, this is not quite as you expect. Having seen the full 80-odd minute video version of the ""Straight Shooter"" M&P documentary one assumes this is simply a straight transferral onto DVD ... alas, unfortunately not. For the DVD manufacturers have, bizarrely, chosen to EDIT DOWN the original biog to a mere 55-minutes in length ... and we all thought that DVD was the format of the future, offering the best in quality AND quantity ! Nevertheless, if you can accept the edited version then this is still an enjoyable hour spent in front of the TV. Rare footage, home movies, and classic music that recalls better days. However, in the light of the recent and tragic passing of JP, then maybe we can one day expect the definitive biog of the quartet, but until then ... the video version of this will do nicely thank you.",997056000,23,837,4.586666666666667
8313131,2,B000059HB2,"The Mamas and the Papas were one of the major bridges between folk and pop-rock in the early sixties.  Their music was without peer, between the strength of John Phillips' compositions and the execution of them by the group as a whole--most memorably Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot--they made a profound impression that belies their short existence as a group.  As such I have to agree with the previous reviewer, there's simply not enough MUSIC to justify the price of this disc.
What's needed is for some enterprising executive at some huge multinational oligopoly to realize that what's really needed is to release a dvd of live and studio performances, preferably as a companion to Cass Elliot's stellar ""Don't Call Me Mama Anymore"" show that was broadcast on network television in the early 70s (& recently re-released on CD).  THAT would rate 5 stars!",993340800,13,860,4.958333333333333
