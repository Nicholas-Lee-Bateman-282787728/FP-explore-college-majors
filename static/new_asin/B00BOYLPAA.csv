8572026,2,B00BOYLPAA,"Okay, I should have been smarter: I sat down hoping/expecting to see
a reasonable, thoughtful examination of the history of Socialism.

Since I constantly hear ""socialism"" used essentially as an epithet in the U.S.
--despite the lack of any worthwhile agreed-upon working definition of the term--
I sincerely hoped to learn something.

My first clue that something was very wrong, was that the intro was by Ben Wattenberg.
Now, I like and respect BW, but anyone who knows anything about his politics
knows that he's absolutely not the guy to give you an objective treatment of socialism,
an institution he hates. It would be like a Raiders fan making a YouTube video
about my San Diego Chargers. Or Paul Krugman doing 3 excruciating hours on supply-side economics.

Further, the 3 hour series is based on a book by fellow hard-core neo-conservative
Joshua Muravchik. I'm not as familiar with him, but I'm guessing he'd be interesting
to read if the topic were, say, neo-conservative politics.

So, if you are the 1 person in 10,000 childishly wondering:
""What would the American Enterprise Institute like me to believe about socialism?""
then this series is for YOU!  :)

For everyone else, or anyone looking for an academic, half-way objective treatment of socialism,
do not waste your time or money here.",1368921600,,1305,5.018518518518518
8572027,5,B00BOYLPAA,"The purchaser should purchase all three of these discs in order to get the whole picture of socialism. Both Ben Wattenburg and Joshua Muravchick, with help from others, have given the viewer a true and total picture of the failure of the 20th Century, socialism.

Whether the socialism was of the dictatorial variety (communism and fascism) or the democratic variety, these programs show its failure. Part two also shows how socialism may start off as a free and democratic system in third world nations but eventually degrades into dictatorship and brutality, as was the case in Tanzania (shown in Part Two) and also in Ghana under Kwame Nkruma (not shown).

These three programs need to be seen by all who value freedom because they show that freedom and socialism are incompatible. Whether its the failure of the Labour Party in Britain, the Mapai of Israel, the SPD of Germany or the brutality of the Communists and Fascists of Central and Eastern Europe, ""collective"" ownership by the state is failure.

The films' shortcoming is that it does not show the spiritual damage socialism does to a society. There is no discussion of how the will to greatness of a nation and people is sapped by big government, whether it is national will or individual will. However, the economic damage shown is enough to turn any but the most ideologically convinced viewer into an anti-socialist.",1365206400,2,1383,4.927038626609442
