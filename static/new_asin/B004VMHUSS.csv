4483517,5,B004VMHUSS,"I bought this Blue Ray for my father who loves Tim Minchin, seriously I once saw him sit at his computer for 5 hours watching Tim Minchin on Youtube. This is a UK only release so I was worried it might not play on his BluRay player, but oddly enough it worked fine without any issues at all.",1356393600,6,291,4.0344827586206895
4483518,5,B004VMHUSS,"I found out about Tim Minchin about 2 years ago. I very quickly became fairly obsessed. If you enjoy music and comedy with a touch of humanism, then I guarantee you will like Tim and this performance DVD.",1355184000,2,204,4.394736842105263
4483519,5,B004VMHUSS,Fabulous entertainment from the fabulously talented Tim Minchin.,1350864000,,64,7.125
4483520,5,B004VMHUSS,Not even one off note! The whole show was wonderful and hilarious. Even the obviously off-the-cuff banter with the audience was charming. So well performed and recorded that you will look forward to the next reviewing.,1346716800,,218,5.083333333333333
4483521,5,B004VMHUSS,"I'm a huge Minchin fan.  I've watched and/or listened to everything he's published.  I own all the albums and videos, and this is my favorite of all of them.

There's tons of fresh material not to be found in his other released works, or even at his typical touring set, at least through 2010 and 2011 shows.  It's slick, well-produced, and near technically flawless.  And of course seeing Tim with one of the world's finest symphony orchestras is outstanding fun.

I am not sure about the Blu Ray region.  I have an American PS3 (Region A), and it plays for me without any problem.",1335916800,12,582,4.538461538461538
4483522,5,B004VMHUSS,"I have watched this countless times since it came. Tim Minchin is pure genius. He makes you laugh and more importantly, makes you think.",1407283200,,136,4.708333333333333
4483523,5,B004VMHUSS,This DVD is great.  I happened to see Minchin's show on TV while staying at a hotel during a road trip and immediately bought it as soon as I got back home.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this!,1400803200,,200,3.975
4483524,5,B004VMHUSS,"Tim Minchin is hilarious, and impressively talented. His musical comedy is refreshing, as are his simple observations about the absurdity of things. Then he sings Beauty, and it's clear that he has a deeper understanding of life and art, than I might have thought. I wanted to give this six stars.

I've heard that the DVD won't play in the US, but the Blu-ray disk worked and looked great, so who needs a DVD?",1396915200,,410,4.54054054054054
4483525,5,B004VMHUSS,"Tim MInchin is brilliant. And blisteringly funny. And an insanely talented and clever songwriter. And charismatic out the ying-yang. And an incredible musician. (BTW, his skills on the piano are even more mind-blowing when you know that he doesn't read music, he is completely self-taught, he writes songs by just sitting down at the piano and plunking it out until it sounds like what he wants it to). Admittedly, he isn't for everyone. He is very strong and clear about his religious beliefs, which is that he is devoutly athiest (if you understand the joke that that phrase is, you'll like Tim), and he passionately proselytizes for critical thinking. So if you are a person of deeply Christian beliefs, you most likely won't like Tim. However, if you are someone who wouldn't be offended by songs that criticize the dangers that are often perpetuated in the name of religion, and are an intelligent and thinking person, then I cannot recommend Tim Minchin highly enough.

This particular performance is amazing, recorded at the Royal Albert Hall in London with a 55-piece orchestra. My personal favorites that I can't stop laughing at are Thank You God, Lullaby (including the story of when he and his wife told their three-year-old daughter the story of how she was adopted), and the Pope Song. However, just when you think he is nothing but a goof, he'll write a song like White Wine in the Sun, which is so touching it just makes you weep, written for his daughter's first Christmas.

I am admittedly biased, I adore Tim Minchin and would love just about anything he does, but this concert is truly a great time, one you'll watch over and over. I know I do.",1391990400,3,1664,4.7543252595155705
4483526,5,B004VMHUSS,"Witty, Spectacularly Funny, Smart, Offensive, and AWESOME!!  What more do you want!  In this amazing visually stunning concert, you get a front seat at a LIVE Tim Minchin event with an Orchestra!

Need I say more?

Enough said!",1387756800,,227,4.894736842105263
4483527,5,B004VMHUSS,"Love Tim's work! Laughed and Laughed!
Had no trouble playing it on my computer using VLC. Don't let the non-US Region keep you from buying this!",1384732800,,144,4.576923076923077
4483528,5,B004VMHUSS,"Very entertaining dvd.  The music is great and the lyrics amazing.  And yes, Tim Minchin, you deserve your own 60 piece orchestra!",1376352000,,130,4.863636363636363
4483529,3,B004VMHUSS,"I could not play it on my DVD player, I had to watch it on my computer. I was excited to show everybody on my big screen but no go!!!",1372896000,,133,3.466666666666667
4483530,1,B004VMHUSS,"I looked forward to enjoying this DVD which unhappily will play only in the regions of Europe, South Africa or Japan. Certainly not
on any DVD- player in Los Angeles, California, USA. Presumeably Amazon stands behind the seller 'Oxfordshire England'
Well they do nothing to honor and uphold the impeccable reputation of their host 'Amazon'
( of course I do not hate the product it was my only way to make this report to you)  Sincerely Rod Taylor",1372291200,,446,4.717948717948718
4483531,3,B004VMHUSS,"It's fun but excessive. The second song, about how comedy can suffer in arenas, says it all. ""Thank You God"" is just as biting as an atheist Minchin fan would hope for, and very catchy too, but his use of ""bitch"" in the song was a totally needless insult. You'll laugh at his bit comparing the Quran to a Harry Potter book and wince at his commentary on Emma Watson. He should find more creative composers to match his lyrical genius.",1362441600,,434,4.37037037037037

8443636,5,B004VMHUSS,I love Tim Minchin. This show working with Jules Buckley gave you an array of emotions. While slipping in comedy and intelligent song lyrics.,1454198400,,141,4.916666666666667
8443637,5,B004VMHUSS,Received in excellent condition.  Talented performance which surprisingly appeals to quite a large diverse audience.  Hope to see a sequel!,1442188800,,139,5.9
8443638,5,B004VMHUSS,"Great concert, was featured on Showtime last year. Amazing. True musical and comic genius.",1431993600,,90,5.5
8443639,5,B004VMHUSS,Really like Tim Minchin.  He is so normally warped... I buy just about all of his performances.,1430697600,,95,4.588235294117647
8443640,5,B004VMHUSS,"Okay, so my inner 12-year-old comes out to play when I watch this. So?",1428969600,,70,4.071428571428571
8443641,5,B004VMHUSS,"Fantastic performance.  I first saw a cut version of this show on showtime and knew I needed to own it.  I didn't know the bluray would have additional material, and though these added songs aren't as strong as the ones I'd already seen they were very strong indeed.  For anyone looking for a family outing as fun as Mr Minchin's score from Matilda let me make it clear this is Adult with a capital A.  Subject mater falls firmly in the South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut arena of musicals.  Hilarious and wonderful a must own for anyone interested in musical satirists.  A technical: note this bluray claims to be region encoded for the UK but it played brilliantly on my PS4 purchased from the USA.",1417996800,,699,4.552
8443642,5,B004VMHUSS,"Tim Minchin brings his unique style of intelligent humor and music and joins it with a great orchestra -- and at a great location! Songs like, ""Thank You God"" continue to run through my head long after watching it. It's absolutely beautiful work. Thanks Tim!",1412208000,,258,4.7555555555555555
