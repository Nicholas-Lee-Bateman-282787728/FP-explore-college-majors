2302554,4,B0009NSDW0,"This group of 4 made-for TV movies are the first ones in which author Robert B. Parker and his wife Joan actually had some say in the scripts.  As other reviewers point out, potential weaknesses here for viewers are the absence of the TV series Susan Silverman (Barbara Stock) and moving the locations from Boston to Toronto.
However, that having been said, if you are a fan of the novels (I've read most of them) over the Spenser:for Hire TV series (I only saw a handful), then you will find no better film adaptation of a Spenser novel than the first TV movie: Ceremony.  The surprise ending in the film even rivals the book!  Barbara Williams does an excellent job in my opinion as Susan Silverman, although taking nothing away from Barbara Stock's performance in the series.
The second movie, Pale Kings and Princes, is almost as good as the first, and is very close to the novel. But here we start to see how Toronto locales begin to cause the film to suffer.
The last two movies, Judas Goat and A Savage Place, are big unfortunate letdowns, again, in my  opinion.  Not only do we suffer from the location again, but also poor acting in some of the supporting roles, scripts departing too much from the novels, and finally Wendy Crewson replacing Barbara Williams is the final straw to moving these two films into no more than 2 stars.
Having said that, if you are a fan of the novels as much as I, at least check out Ceremony.  It is worth the price  of the four DVDs together.
One final note: Robert Urich is Spenser to me, despite how little I watched the TV series.  And there can be no one better to play Hawk than Avery Brooks.  He clearly understood the character.  I did not like the A&E Spenser movies with Joe Montegna.  He is a fine actor, but I don't buy him as fun-loving private detective who is also an ex-prize fighter.  What weight class did he fight in?  Similarly none of the supporting characters were cast well.
As Robert B. Parker pointed out early on in an interview about the Spenser for Hire series, there is the TV Spenser, and there is his Spenser from the novels.  But these four movies made a close stab at bringing that private detective in print to life.",1122940800,4,2190,4.456140350877193
2302555,5,B0009NSDW0,"I too am a long time fan of Robert Urich. I'm patiently waiting, like so many others for the Spenser TV series to be released on DVD. What are they waiting for??? I just find it a shame that every cheezy TV series from the 70s is getting released, but why deny us Robert Urich fans more of his work? It's bad enough that he died way too soon. Give his fans an opportunity to let his work live on.",1121558400,10,396,3.9625

2302557,3,B0009NSDW0,"As one of the many Spenser fanatics who have been waiting for the TV series to be released, I was so very happy to see a release date for the 4 movies. Just seeing the crew again brought back many memories of the show that should have had a much longer run. I had originally planned to give the package 4 stars but while cleaning out an old closet, I found two VHS tapes I made of the the original show.  After watching 8 episodes of the show, I realized that I could only give the movies 3 stars. I missed the original music and the voiceover that gave the show its literate and gritty feel. I missed the city of Boston and the surrounding area which made this show unique. The chemistry between Spenser and the real Susan Silverman made the chemistry in the movies seem forced to me.  Hawk in all his glory reminded me why he was one of the most memorable characters in TV history.  He was toned down in the movies. If you weren't a loyal follower of the TV show, the movies will be a 4 star viewing pleasure for you.  If you were, then you will smile once again and pray that the original show will be released soon.",1121126400,9,1119,4.166666666666667
2302558,3,B0009NSDW0,"It is really great to finally see Spenser being released on DVD. Unfortunately The movies are simply not as good as the actual show was. Gone is the Boston locale (sorry folks Toronto just does not look much like Boston), gone is the original Susan, gone is the fine original soundtrack music and finally also gone is the great Spenser voice overs. Regarding the voice overs Parker did not like them and felt that they detracted from the show's content so the producers gave him his way with the movies. To me they were one of the things that made the show so much fun and also made the viewer feel like they were a part of the action. On a side note: Parker has mentioned many times that he felt that Urich was not right for the role. . . but whenever I read one of the books he is how I envision the character of Spenser. And what can you say about Avery Brooks. . .he was a perfect Hawk. If like me you are just happy for the chance to revisit this great TV show and it's characters then by all means pick up this collection. Let's hope that Warner Brothers sees that there is enough interest out there to finally release the series on DVD.",1120176000,10,1143,4.223744292237443
2302559,4,B0009NSDW0,"They say Robert Parker grew unhappy with the network interpretation of Spenser. they even say he objected to Urich in the role. But Parker probably owes a lot more book sales to Urich's signature role as the smart and philosophical PI in boston.

I loved this show when it aired, even though I was only 14 at the time.

Avery Brooks was exceptional as Hawk. So much so, they spun him into a solo series that ultimately failed. It failed because whoever was in charge forgot what made Hawk so popular - his wiseass, tough guy personality. All those Hawk-eque qualities got down played in the Hawk series. So it was nice to see him return to the 4 movies in the early 90s. (His Hawk was so good, that Deep Space 9 eventually had him Hawk-ify his Commander role on that show).

The lack of a regular Susan (or the return of the original) hurts these movies only slightly.

And this time Parker took the reigns and adapted them from his books. Eventually, he adapted one or two more with Joe Mantagna as Spenser, but it never worked as well and the series of movies ceased. Parker has now moved on to Jesse Stone, his newest novel character and Tom Selleck has made one TV movie that is also excellent.

Missing also here are original Belson actor and Lt Quark. But they play only minor roles.

Unlike a TV episode, these are fully contained stories told over a larger canvas that takes more time and a more film like pace. Also missing is Boston as the city they film in - very noticable and saddening. Spenser drives a Ford Probe rather than the classic Mustang, which is also a let down. But those are only asthetic items.

Let's hope that fans scoop these movies on DVD up, since word is that these are tests to see if the regular series 3 seasons are worth the time and effort to release. Let's show them that they are, and buy these when they come out.",1119744000,109,1854,4.372093023255814
2302560,4,B0009NSDW0,I've seen a few of these.  If your a Spenser fan you'll enjoy them.  Also wanted to add my voice to those calling for the actual TV series to be released on DVD.  That will be worth owning.,1118534400,9,189,3.9210526315789473
2302561,4,B0009NSDW0,"Perhaps the signature role in Robert Urich's too short career. Spenser, with an 's' like the poet, was a tough talking Private Eye in Boston. He likes to cook, and he loves Susan Silverman. He garners help on a regular basis from Hawk, a former mob enforcer who respects what Spenser stands for.

The first two of these movies are decent enough. They capture some of the flavor of the TV show. Although the production moved from Boston to Toronto to cut costs. Also in a cost-cutting measure, they replaced the series' Susan (Barbara Stock) with Barbara Williams and later Wendy Crewson. (A move that Urich admitted was a bad one.) ABC produced the first two movies after cancelling the series. The latter two were produced for Lifetime Television.

Robert B. Parker, who penned the novels on which the series was based, co-wrote the first two of these movies with his wife. The quality of the first two scripts notwithstanding, the productions suffered from the move to Toronto. While it is a beautiful city, it doesn't have the same feel as Beantown.

The latter two cable movies are a hollow shell of what made the show great. It's basically a cut-and-paste job.

That having been said, I would guess that Warner Bros. is keeping a close eye on the sales of this set to decide if they'll release the great series on DVD. So, if you want to see the real ""Spenser: For Hire"" you'll have to go through here to get it.",1118102400,159,1417,4.58893280632411
2302582,4,B0009NSDW0,The movies were great but I was expecting the whole series and episodes in my order. I don't think it was made clear that it was for only 4 movies.

2302583,1,B0009NSDW0,"Very Disappointing for a true Spenser Fan. This movie series was clearly edited by a woman, and does NOT follow the books. The role of Susan has been altered to be more like the lead role, and Spenser is portrayed as a dumb sidekick to Susan, who does all of the real sleuthing. Please !!! Not to mention, the only one who can act here is Robert Urich, the rest of the cast is barely believable.
Susan is supposed to be ""gorgeous"" , not a dull looking super sleuth. This might be entertaining to some, but I say ""don't waste your money"".",1392768000,,537,4.2745098039215685

2302623,3,B0009NSDW0,"While we Spenser fans wait for Warner Bros. to release the regular series on dvd, at least we have these 4 cable movies starring Urich & Brooks to tide us over. It's a shame ABC/Lifetime was unable to get Barbara Stock and Ron McLarty to return as Susan and Belson or actually film these in Boston. I also don't understand why over the course of 4 films they needed 2 different actresses to play Susan(Barbara Williams was the better of the 2). Those quibbles aside, it was great to see Robert Urich as Spenser again. He's definitely better than the doughy Joe Mantegna, who played Spenser in 3 movies for A&E. By the way, there's some brief nudity in the first cable movie Ceremony. That was filmed for foreign release and that scene is included.",1260576000,5,747,4.54074074074074
2302624,1,B0009NSDW0,"As a big fan of the '85-'88 Spenser: For Hire TV series, I anticipated the arrival of my Amazon order of this Spenser movie collection.  My anticipation quickly dried up - replaced by a sense of shock and sorrow...

""Ceremony"", the first chronologically of these Made-for-TV movies, bears the closest resemblance to the TV series.  Robert Urich (Spenser) and Avery Brooks (Hawk) do their usual stellar work and the movie has the feel (and strength of story line) close to the original Spenser series.  It's a touch off, in terms of quality, but forgivable for Spenser fans.

The other movies here - Pale Kings and Princes, The Judas Goat, and A Savage Place - are a disappointment, at best.  I could certainly use the terms ""pale"" and ""savage"" from the individual titles in describing these poor attempts at recreating the feel and strength of the Spenser TV series, but I'll leave that to your imagination...  But to sum up the experience: I found watching these three painful - especially considering Urich and Brooks, who I consider excellent actors and all-around ""classy"", seemed surrounded - perhaps trapped - by thin story lines and poor acting that not even they could save.

Bottom line?  Far from satisfying, this collection deeply disappoints and I don't know that there are adequate words to fully describe that disappointment.  Buy ""Ceremony"" by itself and save your money and time - this collection is not worth either.  As another reviewer said, ""Spenser, Spenser, where art thou?""",1257811200,8,1496,4.967871485943775

2302628,4,B0009NSDW0,"As a long-time fan of the Spenser character I was delighted to discover these movies.  I thought I remembered a TV series a couple of decades ago that I didn't particularly enjoy (but I hadn't discovered the books at that time.) I enjoyed all four of the movies but the first two were better.  Wendy Crewson was terribly miscast as Susan.  I hadn't seen the Spenser, for Hire DVDs when I watched these four movies so I thought the woman playing Susan in the first two was perfectly fine.  After purchasing the Spenser, for Hire DVDs, however, and seeing Barbara Stock in the Susan Silverman role I have to say that she was the best.  By the way, the Spenser, for Hire DVDs that I purchased were of very poor quality.  There were 17 discs  and over 1/2 of them were damaged.  Disc 16 was a duplicate of disc 15.  So yes, Warner, let's have a quality production of this great series.  P.S. Does anyone know why the Susan Silverman character is missing from Season Two?",1233532800,2,966,4.4375

Robert Urich does only an adequate job, perhaps due to the script he was given, but Hawke, as portrayed in the videos, loses his ""cool"" demeanor, (the actor seems to be trying way too hard to be cool) and the Susan Silverman character is not portrayed, to my eyes and ears, in any of the ways as she comes across in the written word of Parker nor are her looks, dress or behavior as Parker/Spencer describe. I always laugh out loud while reading Parker's Spencer, especially when he and friend Hawke spar, and much of that relationship is missing, for me, in the videos.  The character of Susan is too present in the videos, much more than she is in the books.  I do know that those of us who read a lot, form pictures in our minds of how the characters look, move, and speak, so it may be a mistake, on my part, to watch a movie after reading the book and ""knowing"" in my own mind how those characters should come across.

2302672,3,B0009NSDW0,"I love Robert B. Parker's Spenser character.  As a kid growing up I also loved the television series.  Spenser and Hawk are, simply put, two of the greatest characters in crime fiction ever.

These four Spenser movies starring Robert Urich as Spenser and Avery Brooks as Hawk, were produced in the mid-1990's and are nostalgic for me, reminding me of the television series.  That said they are made for television movies with all the flaws.  The supporting cast is pretty weak in terms of acting ability and the stories are just a tad less dramatic than the books.  It's kind of like watching the Lifetime Movie of Week for men.  So, overall, after seriously viewing these movies again, I have to say they are not all that good.  Urich and Brooks do make a great team though and while not totally true to Spenser, are close enough, and entertaining enough.

Certainly one of things missing, as pointed out in previous posts, is the city of Boston.  It is a character in the novels and was made so during the 80's series.  Vancouver is a poor substitute.

Gone is the sexual tension between Spenser and Susan, along with the introspective chats - a big part of the novels.  These movies feel like a Perry Mason movie; all that is important is the resolution of the mystery.  And the mysteries are not very interesting.

I bought the set to show support for the release of the series on DVD; I don't believe much more should be expected from this collection.

UPDATE: Warner Archive has finally released Season 1 of Spenser for Hire!!!  Let's support these and get the rest of these seasons!

2302680,3,B0009NSDW0,"I thought these Movies would lead to the rebirth of the series, but alas not.  Then there was the all too soon death of Mr. Robert Urich, and then I knew it as all over.

Though the movies tried to stick to the original story line it seem the producers were somewhat lost, or had never read, or seen the original series.  Good to see the producers try and fail, but quite a dissappointment.  Missing was the grittness of the original series, and the hard hitting street level story telling, the Robert Urich narration, quotes from some our famous classics writers.  Mr. Urich quoted these passages as if he had read them first hand.  I read somewhere that was all Mr. Urich, and he had read the books from which he quoted.

I found these story lines somewhat naked, and lacking in depth, though all in all they were fair to say the least, though I did miss Spenser's original Lover.

To sum it all up the movies are worth a look, but this all leaves me wondering why the producers have refused to realease the original series on DVD.  Guys, settle your disputes and release the series, PLEASE.",1163808000,6,1093,4.452261306532663
2302681,5,B0009NSDW0,"As a long time fan of Robert Urich and Robert B Parker, I felt that the ""Spencer For Hire"" TV series (and books) were of the highest order.

Robert Urich's playing of this role alongside Avery Brooks and their sardonic interaction and understated humour are what made the series for me - so when the ""collection"" became available there was no hesitation but that it had to be in my collection!  I'm just sorry the series has only 4 movies!

2302692,4,B0009NSDW0,"Robert Urich may not have been the best actor you have ever seen, but he was always a solid one, and this is no exception.  A very entertaining series, and one I will happily watch again over time.",1162425600,4,197,4.184210526315789
2302693,2,B0009NSDW0,"The movies were pretty good.  These DVDs appeared to offer closed captioning but I could not get that feature ""on.""  Therefore, the person I bought them for could not enjoy them.",1156032000,,178,4.709677419354839
2302694,3,B0009NSDW0,"The four Robert Urich full length movies published after the ""Spenser For Hire"" tv series went off the air were of varying value.

The first two ""Ceremony"" and ""Pale Kings & Princes"" being set in Boston, were more enjoyable than the final two ""Judas Goat"" and ""A Savage Place"" which were obviously filmed in Canada.

I would still like to see the original 66 ""Spenser For Hire"" tv shows published as a DVD set, however, that doesn't seem too likely in the near future.  I'd also like to see the 13 ""A Man Called Hawk"" tv shows in DVD format!

Even the Joe Mantegna videos originally published on VHSs, ""Small Vices,"" ""Thin Air,"" and ""Walking Shadow"" should be made into DVDs.

Mantegna was a ""better fit"" for the Spenser character, even by Robert B. Parker's standards than Robert Urich!

Since Mantegna now does the audio tapes of most of Parker's Spenser books, it would only seem logical that he should continue the series of recent books beyond the three VHSs he originally made, and these should be available in DVD format.

I'm sure many would purchase reasonably priced DVDs or DVD sets.",1151712000,12,1094,4.666666666666667
2302695,1,B0009NSDW0,"First of all, I wish to share my dejection of this collection; the sound and lighting was terrible. Secondly, two of the dvd's were the same under a different name. Namely, ""a savage place"" and ""ceremony"". Just threw some good money down the drain.

2302699,5,B0009NSDW0,"An excellent reprisal of Robert and Joan novels. As a former resident of Boston, the series when it was filmed in and around Boston provided a visual tour of my former home. The books later took on a symbionic relationship with the TV Series as either by design or by accident the Silouette on the cover for the books released during this time period appeared to be a youthful Urich, rather than the porty character (more like the 1970s TV Cannon) which was mor ethe interpretations of the earlier Bob Parker novels.",1139184000,,516,4.619565217391305

2302701,3,B0009NSDW0,"When are the 'people' at Warner (who I believe own distribution rights) ever going to wake up and release Spenser: For Hire the complete series? It makes no sense. Then, they throw this wish-wash at us. Sorry, I'm not buying it simply to push along the Warner executives to release the REAL Spenser! If you want my money TED, give me want I want -- UPDATE: May 26, 2012 -- From SitcomsOnline.com: (in response to a user's question to the Warner Archive Collection's Facebook account: ""SPENSER is being considered for mass-merchant release, but if that doesn't pan out, we'll be happy to take up the cause for his liberation."" So, it looks as if the series may not only be coming to DVD, but it may even be coming out as a mass-merchant release! And if it doesn't pan out, it sounds like Warner Archive will potentially take over. However, given the interest in '80s detective series, this one feels like one which would really work as a general retail release, so we're hoping to see some movement in this direction for this series. We'll let you know when we know more.'",1130544000,45,1071,4.583333333333333
2302722,3,B0009NSDW0,"For me, these ""made for TV"" movies do not capture the spirit of the original series. Having read all the books also you can tell that it is more true to Parker's Spenser (extra time helps). However the vitality that Urich/Brooks (and Boston as a backdrop) originally brought to the series is missing (and later efforts with Joe Mantegna do nothing to capture this). ""Ceremony"" did the best job of recapturing the feeling, but it just had that ""Return to -your favorite series-"" feel. As others have said here, release the series on DVD.",1129420800,13,536,4.712765957446808
2302723,4,B0009NSDW0,"Having been a fan of the series, and the books, each in their own way, finding these movies as a box set was a rare treat.  I had only seen parts of these movies during their first-run, so to me they were new.  Robert Urich IS Spenser, and the book scripts suit him even better than the TV shows did.  He really brings the wise-cracks to life and delivers them so well, and fast, that you want to jump back a few seconds to hear the delivery again.

Several of the reviewers mentioned that the voice-overs were no longer an element of the new movies.  While I still have one of the films to watch, all of the other 3 had a good bit of voice-overs in them, so I don't really understand what they are getting at.  The replacement of Susan, repeatly, doesn't seem to make much sense... though I will say that I though Barbara Williams was closer to the book version of Susan than the others.  I have seen one of the new Spenser films... and while Joe Mantegna is lacking as Spenser... the HAWKS are horrible.  Avery IS Hawk... end of story.  Here's to the series on DVD, may it come soon....",1125705600,29,1088,4.242718446601942
2302724,3,B0009NSDW0,"""Spenser: For Hire"" these four Lifetime telefilms are not (consider your purchase of this collection a vote for the release of the original series), but they sure are fun on a Sunday afternoon when I'm in between Parker novels.

Despite the author's feelings to the contrary, Urich as our hero has been dead-on in my mind's eye. Yes, Avery Brooks as Hawk was simply inspired. Their chemistry remaining intact in this collection of movies is what preserves their watchability.

A hidden treat inside each DVD case is four short Spenser essays - each detailing the production of the films, as well as some background on the original series and opinion from Parker about the television Spenser. Each treatise is well-written and enjoyable.

So along with the collection of books I've amassed, I look forward to the day I can share my love of Hawk, Susan and the cocky, cool PI from Boston with my son - whom we named ""Spenser.""",1124582400,10,924,4.7625
2302725,5,B0009NSDW0,"I am a big fan of both Dr. Parker and Spenser. These movies for whatever they may end up, save for the original series to be released on DVD, are what Spenser is. Joe Mantegna plays Spenser but Robert Urich was Spenser. Mantegna could have been Spade or Marlowe, just not Spenser. These do suffer without Barbara Stock but I bought them and can only hope WB or Rykodisc wil have the good sense to release the original series sooner than later. Meanwhile enjoy.",1124496000,,460,4.488095238095238
2302726,3,B0009NSDW0,"I didn't know that ABC cable produced the 2 first movies(the best) of these 4 included in this boxset because it wasn't aired in my country. I followed the original Tv Series which was aired in Spain and I loved them. Urich perfomance was crisp and even funnier as a P.I in Boston who likes to cook,play football and likes nice women. Also was the Hawk character well played by Avery Brooks as the tough guy and associate of Spenser. Susan Siverman also helps as the friend of the P.I. and who presents all cases to him.

In the movies  of these set they moved from Boston to Toronto which is noticed in the last movies due to budget limits. Spenser drives a Ford Probe which I own and was good to see despite his legendary Mustang for publicity reasons. In the last films he drove again a Mustang painted in a different color than the series. Susan character is replaced by an Canadian actress Barbara Williams in the 2 first films who does good as original Barbara Stock did. Then without reason is replaced by Wendy Crewson(Air Force One) who doesn't act as good as the first.

The only good thing to see is Avery Brooks in the 4 movies I can't imagine been replaced by another one.

Hope soon the studio answers the petitions of readers here and releases the original Tv Series which was aired from 85 to 88 and was cancelled by surprise by ABC.",1124323200,12,1349,4.405622489959839
2302727,4,B0009NSDW0,"I am a big fan of the ""Spenser for Hire"" television series, and I was brokenhearted when the series was cancelled.  I remember when the first Spenser movie came out, I was overjoyed, but I thought that the movies had a few too many dead spots, as if these stories were written for the one hour alotted for the television series, and not for a full length film.  I did enjoy seeing Robert Urich, and it is hard to believe that I won't see him again in a new Spenser movie.  As for Avery Brooks,  what can I say, he was born to play ""Hawk"". I do recommend the movie collection because it is a great chance for all of us to get a taste of good television.  We may never see it this good again.  Unless of course, the Spenser series is released on video. I rate this collection with 4 stars, not five, because of the slower pace, but the dialogue was first rate, as well as the chemistry between Urich and Brooks.  Enjoy!!",1124064000,5,918,4.181818181818182
2302728,5,B0009NSDW0,"I am so happy to be able to see Robert Urich as Spenser again!  I would prefer the television series to the movies for television, but I will take what I can get.  I have read all of Parker's books.  Hawk and Spenser as personified in the series are a perfect fit.  Susan is the one I never thought they got right.",1123718400,,314,4.016129032258065
2302729,3,B0009NSDW0,"I was a huge fan of the Robert B. Parker Spenser novels before they were adapted for TV. The show itself had a lot of good qualities.  Robert Urich did not really pull off Spenser, but then I don't know who could have.  Spenser, a former prizefighter turned poem-quoting, gourmet-cooking, iron-pumping super private eye, was and is the kind of character who can never be captured fully. Urich brought his own charisma and familiar TV presence to the role, and made it his own, in company with the brilliant portrayal of Hawk by Avery Brooks, before his Star Trek: Deep Space Nine days.  Filmed on location in Boston, the series captured a lot of the good qualities of the books.  The four TV movies presented here were an attempt to recapture the series after its cancellation.  The results are a mix: the first two are fine, the second two are pretty dismal. Ceremony and Pale Kings and Princes had the guiding hand of Parker in the adaptation, and Urich and Brooks are in fine form, perfectly recapturing their chemistry from the TV show. A lot of people didn't like the recasting of Susan Silverman with Barbara Williams, but I think she's great, tough and sexy and well-involved in the stories. For unknown reasons, the two movies that followed, Judas Goat and A Savage Place, are pretty bad. Parker was not involved, Susan was recast yet again, to detrimental impact this time, and the films are really cheap-looking.  Everyone but Urich seems to be just going through the motions. What would really work is to have the first season of the TV show put out on DVD! A note on location: Toronto (where the movies were filmed) can't really look like Boston, but in the latter two films, they even give up trying.  Weirdly, Judas Goat is set in Ottawa (""home of the Parliament Buildings,"" as one character lectures) but is still filmed in Toronto! Anyway, it's good to have both Urich and Spenser back on film, a welcome relief from the only recent Spenser films, those dreadful Joe Mantegna shows made for A&E.  Remember, it's with an S, like the poet!",1123545600,4,2053,4.667590027700831
2302730,5,B0009NSDW0,"These are great movies for those of us who enjoyed reading all of Robert Parker's Spenser books.  The movies were great since it has been so long since the Spenser for Hire series aired on TV.  There are slight changes from the original books, but they keep pretty close to original story lines.  Would love to see some of the original TV series put on DVD's. It was great to see Robert Urich again.  Parker's son is in each one.
