8467601,4,B005DUNPGS,"This has been described as a World War II take on `Romeo and Juliet' but also has a bit of `The Diary of Anne Frank' about it. It starts off with an elderly Frenchman poring over the diary of his sister and revealing that there is one letter he will or rather can not ever open that the diary still holds.

We are then transported back to 1942 and his sister Sarah, has changed her name to Louise to avoid detection that she is a Jew, played brilliantly by Deborah Durand. She is one of the star crossed lovers as her main man is Hans an SS officer, who knows her true identity and speaks French like a native. She is being hidden by Hugette (Frederique Dupree) an ageing if talented cabaret singer; said cabaret being a fond haunt of the occupying forces. Hugette is providing safety for a number of people and they pass through all the time. She shares the house with her mother who has been struck dumb since the death of her only son. Meanwhile we have Robert, who has fallen head over heels in love with Louise and moreover hates all Germans and this includes Hans, despite the fact that Hans was forced into the post by an over bearing father and is their primary source of aid against his own country.

Things start to unravel when a `resistance fighter' turns up and brings more than his hand luggage as baggage forcing Louise and Hans have to think how they will react.

This is one of those films I had not heard very much about and there is not that much on the inter web either, but it is actually very good. It looks like they had a small budget but that is more than made up by the acting and a character driven plot where there are no passengers. Even the music was good. As usual of films of late this is not a war film, but a film set during war and I think the Romeo and Juliet thing was a bit misleading. This is more a story of conscience, love, honour, stupidity and bags of regret. It was moving in places but does not go all out to milk the emotions and lets you decide pretty much what is right and wrong.

This film is obviously in French with sub titles and a run time of 85 minutes. Directed by new comer Franck Phelizon who has used many an unknown actor and has managed to get outstanding performances all round, I think and hope this is the first of many great films from him.",1337472000,,2306,4.210407239819005
