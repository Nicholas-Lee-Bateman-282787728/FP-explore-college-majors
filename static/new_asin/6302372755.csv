462989,5,6302372755,"I chewed this bit of vocal sweetness for a decade.  I saw it when first aired, and was enthralled.  There were Rockapella's Flat Tires, a gaggle of doo wop legends in full glory, and the cute guys from Zulu, Africa too!(Ladysmith Black Mambazo)  The soundtrack is awesome, but you have to see what goes on on-stage to understand the power of some of these groups.  Spike Lee just does intros and keeps the focus is where it should be.. the A Cappella sweetness.",1023321600,4,461,4.518072289156627
7825736,5,6302372755,"Spike Lee - Please re-release on DVD, for the Love of A Cappella!

Has anyone personally converted to a DVD?  Can I buy a copy?
I currently manage ""Special Delivery"" in Denver (We Do it A Cappella), this is a great primer for new members - to actually ""see the performances"" - like Rockapella's Flat Tire, the mock ""A Cappella Rumble"" in the movie, etc.

Even young kids dig ""Zombie Jamboree"", and it is a workout to perform well!

Spike Lee  - Again - Thank you - what a great work!  Please do a sequel!!!

Thank you

7825738,5,6302372755,Spike's best idea.. Show this in my classes as a special gift when the kids have done great work. They're amazed.,1397001600,,113,4.428571428571429
7825739,5,6302372755,"One of my sons bought Spike Lee's ""do it a cappella"" VHS tape for me when it first came out...A treasured birthday gift.  I can't tell you how many times I watched it with my family - Love, love, love it.  Well, needless to say, with all our efforts to keep the tape in good shape, our VHS player went on the fritz and really messed up the tape...such a bummer!  It was a sad day.  And, of course, 23 years later, I no longer own a VHS player, so couldn't really watch it even if the tape was still good.  Releasing this on DVD would be so wonderful....please!  I would buy a bunch of them and give them to all my kids and friends who really appreciate class ""A"" vocals...spread the joy of a Capella!!!",1388016000,,702,4.125
7825740,5,6302372755,"I just wanted to correct an error in the item description: VHS was NOT the only format this was released on.  It was also released on a broadcast quality Laserdisc (which I have).

Since this old special was produced on standard definition videotape, the Laserdisc will give you as good a quality image as any DVD.  And it will look much better than any VHS tape, which by now may be wearing out.

The music speaks for itself:
(Laserdisc side 1 - 51:28)
1) Overture to the Barber of Seville (4:24) CEMA
2) Zombie Jamboree (4:26) Rockepella
3) I Need You (2:17) True Image
4) Don't Let Your Heart (3:31) The Mint Juleps
5) Looking for an Echo (5:16) The Persuasions
6) Get Away Jordan (5:05) Take 6
7) Something Within Me (4:00) Take 6
8) Flat Tire (3:49) Rockapella
9) Under the Boardwalk (3:43) Rockapella & Tru Image
10) Higher and Higher (4:02) The Mint Juleps
11) Phansi Em Goldini (Down In The Mines) (5:57) Ladysmith Black Mambazo
12) The Lion Sleeps Tonight (4:55) Ladysmith Black Mambazo & The Mint Juleps
(Laserdisc side 2 - 34:18)
13) I'm Going On A Midnight Train (1:44) The Percussions
14) Goldmine (3:31) Take 6
15) Take 6 jam
16) Trickle Trickle (2:27) True Image
17) Yes We Can Can (1:55) True Image
18) I Want To Live Easy (3:43) The Mint Juleps
19) Set Me Free (0:56) The Mint Juleps
20) Ukhalngami (You Cry For Me) (5:00) Ladysmith Black Mambazo
21) N'Kosi Sikeleli Afrika (God Bless Africa) (2:52) Ladysmith Black Mambazo
22) Pretty Woman (3:24) Rockapella
23) Up On the Roof (3:01) The Persuasions
24) Pass On the Love (2:40) The Persuasions (Sung over the credits)

Interviews with the various groups are interspersed in-between the songs.
Some songs are produced in B&W for creative purposes.

Produced in 1990 by WNET for PBS's GREAT PERFORMANCES. (85:56 run time)

The VHS tape is un-interrupted on one tape.  Why no DVD or Blu-ray?  I couldn't say, I hope it is not due to music rights clearances.",1366848000,,1922,4.612903225806452
7825741,5,6302372755,"A couple of years ago I wrote on Spike Lee's 40 Acres and a Mule website requesting info on a ""Do It A Capella"" DVD. I did not receive any response. Thanks for the writer who at LEAST suggested contacting Elecktra. I also remember the original airing of this program. Simply fantastic! Program should be rebroadcast for this younger generation. Maybe Spike or Elecktra can collaborate with PBS to do this. PBS is interested in preserving music history i.e., their oldie shows. Planning to order the VHS from the Amazon seller. Hope the video resolution and sound quality are worth the price.",1352764800,,591,4.803921568627451
7825742,5,6302372755,"This is such a special presentation of the a capella groups that Spike Lee sought out and brought together into this video and who sang together in a moving concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  This was my introduction to Ladysmith Black Mambazo who are still wowing audiences around the world.  I treasure my VHS tape and hope that it does not deteriorate or break.  Along with all the other fans who I know are still out there, I am hoping this will be released on DVD.",1341964800,,477,4.3977272727272725
7825743,5,6302372755,"I was one of the producers of this project and just wanted to let folks know that any DVD release is up to Elektra, the company that released it in the first place.",1196812800,19,164,4.0
7825744,5,6302372755,"I too was fortunate enough to see this when it originally aired AND doubly fortunate to capture it on video. At the time I was in the midst of an 18 year career as a singing drummer. In an effort to recapture the inspiration this wonderful show gave me, I used Rockapella's ""Zombie Jamboree"" as my vocal warm up song for the remaining years of my career.

This music takes it back to the roots. Simply great!

I wish Spike would release it on DVD. My VHS is just about worn out!",1181433600,3,478,4.184782608695652
7825745,5,6302372755,"Okay, so Spike's intro and mock-tour of New York backstreet a cappella venues is a little hokey. Who cares!? I was incredibly lucky to see this program on TV about 12 years ago. It was my re-introduction to doo-wop and my first experience of contemporary  a cappella pop music and Ladysmith Black Mombaza. From this, I went on to the Bobs and other groups, but this was the starting point. Rockapella's ""Flat Tire"", the Mint Julep's ""Higher and Higher"", and Ladysmith's African songs are just wonderful music. And a few years ago, I got to shake Jerry Lawson's hand at a Portland Summer Zoo concert - what a great moment!

Spike - or somebody: PLEASE release this wonderful video on DVD. Forget the extras and interviews and director commentary and all that behind the scenes stuff that drive up production costs. Just remaster and release it, so this wonderful program isn't lost to tape rot.",1120003200,11,893,4.754838709677419
