8341791,3,B001TK29YA,"The good thing about this DVD (and there are very few DVDs about Jainism) is that it has a Jain explaining Jainism. The bad thing is that it is simply one person talking all the way through (with the exception of the person who asks general questions here and there).  The camera is simply set on the person sitting and talking.  The presentation is mildly helpful in understanding Jainism, but simply isn't that engaging.

This DVD is part of the larger series. Each religion is asked and answers the same set of 15 questions. I'm assuming the other religions follow a similar format, with an adherent of each answering the questions, but in simple, 'talking head' style. The similar set of questions might be helpful in comparing and contrasting the various religions. The format and presentation makes it a bit dull. For what this offers, the DVD seems overpriced.",1260921600,7,867,4.805369127516778
