479880,4,6302428939,"This movie is maybe the best showcase of Hopkins' demonic talent.  My favorite scene is when Gangrene challenges Corky to keep Fats quiet for 5 minutes, and Corky, of course, can't do it.  Hopkins' sweaty  stream-of-consciousness psychopathology portrayed here is just  breathtaking.  I think this film has gotten more respect from the  ""critics"" over the years, probably because of Hopkins' Oscar from  Silence of the Lambs (which is not among his best performances, but I'm  glad he got the hardware anyway).  The score features a creepy accordian  that evokes the ""magic"" of the carnival.  William Goldman's  screenplay also gives us a downright hilarious Fats...when he's not killing  someone, that is.",928627200,5,706,5.3090909090909095

It has stayed in my mind all these years because it is very creepy, but still it was a decent story line.  Not like the slasher movies of Jason and Chuckie, etc.  I have not watched it yet because it's part of my October Halloween viewing.  I feel it's a good movie and will creep anyone out.

479958,4,6302428939,"Magic is a 1978 film starring Anthony Hopkins as Corky Withers, a magician and ventriloquist.

Corky was trained in magic by his mentor Merlin. The film starts with Corky's first appearance in a nightclub where he bombs badly. He comes home only to tell Merlin how it was successful which he figures out to not be true.

Merlin then advices he needs to find personality on stage and when Corky asks how, he just responds ""you'll figure it out"".

Several months later a studio executive is invited to the same club by Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith) who turns out to be Corky's manager now. Corky did find his stage personality, a foul mouthed ventriloquist dummy names Fats.

Corky and Fats are now a huge success and ready for the big time.....except for the fact Corky refuses to take a medical exam required by the studio in order to green light his own show.

Ben Greene tries to convince him to do it but Corky melts down and runs back to his hometown of the Catskills in upstate NY. He finds a cabin off Lake Melody which is run by his high school crush, Peggy Ann Snow (Ann Margaret).

While hiding out from Ben Greene and the studio executives Corky both manages to win Peggy's heart while slowly starting to unravel.

Eventually Ben Greene finds Corky at the cabin and at this point Corky begins to come unglued.

Anthony Hopkins acting is excellent in this film, to the point once you see it you couldn't imagine anyone else in the part.  He is mostly known for his role as Hannibal Lector but he is every bit as good here in this role.

The film is criminally under rated, It is well acted by the entire cast and the script is very well written. The film is very creepy and you just cant wait to see how far over the edge Corky and Fats will go.

This film comes highly recommended to the point I think it belongs in everyone's movie collection since it is one I am sure you will want to watch more than once.",1491868800,3,1918,4.374647887323944
479959,5,6302428939,"One of the most brilliantly done horror films of all time, in my opinion.  Quick setup, Anthony Hopkins plays a really crappy ventriloquist.  He tries very hard to do well so he won't let down his ailing mentor, but alas, he continues to fail miserably.  Flash forward a couple years and we see Hopkins character doing amazingly well.  His ventriloquist act is drawing huge crowds, he's getting huge laughs, and tv execs want to talk to him.  The problem, however, is that he can't seem to leave his dummy for very long.  He brings it everywhere and lets it 'interrupt' him and speak for him continuously, that is, when he's not actively arguing with the dummy (even when no one appears to be watching).  His manager (played brilliantly by Burgess Meredith) is concerned and tries to help.  What follows is a fantastic story that walks a very fine line between supernatural and psychological horror.  I'm about to use one of the most cliche'd lines ever, but this is a place where it truly fits.  This move really does blur the lines of fantasy and reality in a way that honestly leaves you guessing until the end.

Regarding the end (without any spoilers), I have to say that I really appreciate that it does clarify those fantasy/reality lines very well.  I can't stand movies that can't make up their mind, or that try to blur those lines only to present you with one side as fact but utterly ruin it with some stupid last minute garbage.  This movie ultimately does make a solid decision and provides an explanation that works very well within the story.  It's really not overly gory or anything either.  Short  topless scene and some profanity, but overall pretty tame end of the R spectrum (might have even been pg-13 these days).",1491523200,4,1736,4.661184210526316

480154,5,6302428939,"Directed by Richard Attenborough in 1978, Magic stars Anthony Hopkins as magician Corky Withers, a troubled man in search of success and love.

As the movie opens, Corky is on stage performing to an audience that has no interest in him. They laugh and they talk and they ignore him completely until, in anger and frustration, he yells at them all. Not a good way to build an audience.

But a year later, everything has changed. Corky Withers now has people lining up and crowding in to see his magic act. The difference, it turns out, is Fats - a vent figure puppet that is a rather creepy caricature of Anthony Hopkins. Fats is delightfully smart and funny and the audience loves him. It looks like Corky and Fats, with the help of new manager Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith) are going to be stars.

Unfortunately, the stress and attention starts to get to Corky, and he takes off to a secluded cabin to get away for a while. He rents the cabin from his old high school flame, Peggy Ann Snow (Ann-Margret) and despite the fact that she is married, they are soon in each others' arms. Unfortunately, the closer they get, the more jealous Fats gets - and when Fats gets angry, things get scary!

I vaguely remembered this movie when it came out in the theaters. I was in 8th grade and went to see it with my mom and I remember it scaring me. That was about all I remembered when I sat down to watch it again, and I really wondered if it would live up to my memories of it being good. It did better than I expected.

Anthony Hopkins is quite wonderful in his role as a man who may or may not be losing his mind. He does a fine job of walking the line between sweetly sympathetic and downright scary, leaving you uncertain as to which side of him is real. His performance in his scenes with Fats are quite impressive.

I heard that the trailer only aired on television a couple of times before they pulled it. Parents were complaining that it was scaring their children too much.

Although made at a time when things were a bit more innocent, you might want to exercise caution when watching this one with your kids. Little ones are still likely to be rather afraid of Fats. There is some sexuality and some psychologically disturbing scenes. Older children should be fine and if they like scary movies, they might really enjoy this one.

Magic was advertised as a ""terrifying love story."" It is a great romance movie to watch during the Halloween season - or anytime you are in the mood for something just a little bit spooky.",1413158400,,2522,4.420258620689655

First rate performances from top to bottom. Anthony Hopkins, Burgess Meredith and Ann Margaret really breathed life into this movie. Hopkins plays an insane ventriloquist named Corky and his vulgar dummy is called Fats. In the role of Corky, Hopkins is much more outwardly disturbed than the subtle genious he demonstrated in his turn as ""Hannibal the Cannibal"". The main source of suspense and menace is that unlike the Twilight Zone dummies and the usual ""Living Dummy"" plots, there is no supernatural elements that suggest Fats is alive. All of Fat's foul dialogue and nasty disposition is purely a product of Corky's diseased psyche. That to me is the most disturbing aspect of the movie. Burgess Meredith is in a cool and rather (at least to me) comical role as a sleazy talent agent who seems to have possibly been fashioned after George Burns due to his perpetual smoking of big cigars. He's easily got the best lines in the movie. Ann Margaret is adorable as Corky's love interest  and she absolutely steals your heart in this flick. Overall, this a solid, disconcerting and entertaining movie. I highly recommend it.",1390694400,6,1292,4.79372197309417

At the beginning when it panned across the dresser and pictures in Corky's room, I was elated to be able to see everything clearly.  It was almost like seeing a different movie.  In my opinion, this is one of Anthony Hopkins best performances and I have seen almost every movie he has made. I look forward to enjoying it multiple times. The character is childlike and sweet at times, but lacks confidence because he knows deep down that something is emotionally/mentally wrong with him.  Later we witness Corky's emotional pain and rage when he loses control.  Anthony played both sides of this personality well.  The scene that is Oscar worthy is when he gets in an uncontrollable rage and goes berserk.  Despite the frightening nature of the film, I found myself hoping against hope that Corky would be stronger that ""Fats"" the dummy and end up with his love Ann Margret.  This is definitely a scary movie and ""Fats"" can send chills down your spine.  If you love Anthony Hopkins, order this now.",1381968000,,1109,4.729166666666667

I recall this movie from years ago and I always liked it, but I didn't recall just how terrifying it is to see that dummy just sitting in a chair staring.  Anthony Hopkins is exceptional playing the successful ventriloquist who gets so into making his dummy talk that he begins to believe the dummy is a real person, thinking and talking on his own, when the dummy is really only saying what Anthony Hopkins wants him to say!  At times, it appears that the dummy is alive and is committing horrible crimes.  I love this movie, but it's creepy in that it's possible for this to really happen.  A ventriloquist could get so into making his dummy partner talk and appear alive that he or she could lose touch with reality and go off the deep end.  Good price for a good movie.

480229,5,6302428939,"Director Richard Attenborough's MAGIC is based on the William Goldman novel and screenplay. This chilling psychological thriller stars Anthony Hopkins as a magician with a clever gimmick: the best part of his stage act is a foul-mouthed wooden dummy with a New York tough accent that heckles him and audience members.

When his agent, Burgess Meredith, tells Hopkins that the only way he can get a network TV contract is to submit to a physical exam, the magician has a violent reaction and refuses. He flees NYC and goes off to find Ann-Margret, a woman he once had an unrequited crush on in high school.

At this point in the story it's clear that the dummy is an evil alter-ego for Hopkins. He often argues with it, even from across a room.

Meredith arrives unexpectedly at Hopkins' hideout and witnesses him fighting with ""Fats."" Now, he not only wants a physical exam, Meredith insists that his client see a shrink. After promising that he'll inform the network that Hopkins is mentally ill if he doesn't take his advice, Meredith leaves.

Fats urges Hopkins to keep ""the Postman"" from getting away and offers himself as a weapon to stop him. Hopkins overtakes Meredith and beats him bloody and unconscious with the dummy. It's just the beginning of the craziness.

This was Hopkins' breakout American movie, one that set the stage for his future stardom. He's superb doing an American accent (for Fats). It's clear however despite the simulation of an engaged voicebox, when Fats speaks it's coming from a separate audio track. (Not a criticism, just a technical note.)

This Movie Is Not For Children. ADULTS ONLY!
Corky (Anthony Hopkins) visits an older man, Merlin (E.J. Andre) and tells him how his performance on Amateur Night in the nightclub was. Merlin has been giving him advice to Corky on how to capture an audience, but that night no one seemed to care about him being on stage doing a card trick. Everyone was involved with their own dates. It made him angry on stage.
  The next year, a network talent representative, Todson (David Ogden Stiers), sits with Corky's agent, Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith), to watch Corky's new act. Corky does the same old card trick. Todson is not amused and is bored with the act. Suddenly, there is a heckler. Corky leaves the stage to go to the heckler. Corky continues to perform as he walks back on stage with his ventriloquist dummy, Fats, who was the heckler. Now the act gets saucy for the adults. Todson is impressed by the throwing of the voice across the room.
 When the network deal goes sour because Corky doesn't want to take a mandatory medical examination, Corky goes off to a retreat by a lake to gather his thoughts and get to know an old high school friend, Peggy Ann Snow (Ann-Margret).
 Someone else comes for a visit and we find out Corky has another act...murder!

Also in the cast: Jerry Houser, Beverly Sanders, Ed Lauter.

Yes, it is Anthony Hopkins doing the voice of Fats.

480248,4,6302428939,"I can't really be critical about this movie because I like it.  I was about 8 when it came out, so  I didn't see it then, but its commercial certainly left an impression...it features Fats the dummy reciting a rhyme that ends with, ""We're dead.""  The commercial was actually pulled from some markets due to parental complaints.  ABOUT THE MOVIE:  A young Anthony Hopkins dominates this movie, with Fats coming in a close second.  It might seem like a very tame R rated movie by todays standards, but the language, violence and adult themes were enough for a simpler time.  I recommend this movie based on the story of a demented man who cannot live his life without his dummy surrogate and longs for his high school obsession Ann Margret to save him...hopes her love will set him finally free.  In the end it is a love story and a tragic one.  Beyond that, I hope you will give it a try and enjoy it.  (FYI, the BluRay version starts the menu with Fats rhyme that creeped out a lot of kids like me.  Also, I think pretty much every straight guy who went to high school with Ann Margret probably had a crush on her...""Oh, Peggy Ann Snow, Please let me follow, Wherever you go."")",1362182400,3,1177,4.402777777777778

480280,2,6302428939,"""Magic"" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche.  Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away.  Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny.  Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing.  Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent.

480332,5,6302428939,"The 1978 film Magic is one of Anthony Hopkins earlier movies and, after watching this, it is plain to see why he is the master of doing suspenseful psychological thrillers. Directed by Richard Attenborough, Magic starred Anthony Hopkins, Ann Margaret, Burgess Meredith and David Ogden Stiers. Written by William Goldman, it told the story of 'Corky' Withers who fails at his first attempt at professional magic. Coming back a year later with ""Fats"", Corky does well on the circuit. When his agent tries to sign him for his own TV show, when it is mentioned he has to take a physical- Corky quickly declines and bails out. Yet, the truth is, he doesn't want them to find out that he suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder and he hears ""Fats"" talking to him. Once in the catskills, he meets up with an old flame-Peggy Ann Snow(Ann Margaret) who is in a marriage on the rocks. They both start up a relationship, which leads to the both of them making love & sparks the jealousy of both Fats and Peggy's husband Duke. That's when the fur starts to fly and the story gets even deeper.

It's been said that, when the movie's trailer first aired, parents claimed that it gave their children nightmares. The trailer itself featured Fats reciting a poem(Abracadabra, I sit on his knee. Presto, change-o, and now he is me! Hocus Pocus, we take her to bed, Magic is fun...we're dead."") after which his eyes roll back in his head. It's followed by a cast reading, then Fats opens his eyes and gazes to his left.

Siskel and Ebert loved the film and placed it at #9 on their top 10 list of great movies for that year. I, personally, loved the movie myself when it first came out and I still watch it from time to time now.

If I had any gripes about the movie, it'd be that Corky and ""Fats"" die at the end. I know that it ties in with what takes place in the book but it would have been cool to see a second film based on the characters. Alas, it wasn't meant to be...which is a real bummer.

480357,5,6302428939,"What I first loved about the 1978 film ""Magic"" was the fact the television trailer I saw in the summer of that year caused me to run out of the room. Granted, I was eleven years old, but the creepiness of this alone made me want to know more. I wouldn't find out more until years later when the film was broadcast in an ""edited for television"" version. I liked it then, but love it in its complete form provided on this dvd.

As some viewers may have already expressed, ""Magic"" contains one of greatest scenes in all of American film. Not by chance, it occurs between two fantastic actors: a young Anothony Hopkins and Burgess Meredith. In the scene, ""Gang Green"" (Meredith) pays his client Corky (Hopkins) a surprise visit in a country cabin. Green is convinced that Corky has gone insane and presents him what should have been a simple challenge: ""Make Fats (the dummy) shut up for five minutes."" The tension that follows is unmistakable as we watch the brilliant Hopkins struggle through these seconds. Meanwhile, Green studies his client with a prophetic eye, knowing that his young magician client can't accomplish the task. It's incredibly suspenseful waiting for Corky to crack, because we already know what Green does, and now are just anticipating his reaction. You will likely never forget this scene, and will feel compelled to watch the film repeatedly just because it's there.

Of course there are many other delights in this minor horror film, which had the misfortune of being released at almost the same time as John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" For those of you who enjoy Ann Margret, we get an eyeful of her as well, and Ed Lauter is superb as her suspicious husband.

480361,5,6302428939,"I cannot even begin to tell you how terrified I was of the 1978 film ""Magic"". Actually, I never got around to seeing the film until recently. What scared the blazes out of me were the darn commercials that ran on television when the film played in the theater. In 1978, I would have been seven or eight years old, depending on when the movie came out. No wonder I was scared! Those advertisements for the film surely rank as one of the most effective marketing campaigns in motion picture history. If you have a copy of the DVD, check out the extras' section on the disc. The ads are there, and they're still horrifying. All we see in the television spot is a closeup on Fats, the main character's dummy, as he recites a poem. It's the music playing in the background, and how the dummy says the words and how he looks when he speaks them, that still send shivers down my spine. I ran out of the room with my hands over my ears when I first heard the commercials, and I felt like doing so again recently. Scary. So scary, in fact, that I spent YEARS looking under my bed every night just to make sure that the maniacal little dummy wasn't waiting for me.

Now that I can bring myself to watch the movie without screaming over those commercials, it's nice to see ""Magic"" and realize it's an excellent, chilling little film. The protagonist of the story is Corky (Anthony Hopkins), a failed magician looking for the one thing that will launch his star. Early on we get to see the utter horridness of his act. It's bad largely because he's so insecure and hesitant onstage. Flash forward roughly a year and we see that our hero has found the golden ticket to Hollywood. Corky managed to construct a highly entertaining ventriloquist act with his dummy Fats. We see him in action in front of a packed house, and it's like he's a totally different person. Confident, funny, not sweating like Richard Nixon on crank--Corky is ready for the big time. His seasoned agent Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith) thinks his client is ready for bigger and better things, too, but there's a slight problem. The television network wants our man (not the dummy) to take a physical as a precondition for employment. Corky flat out refuses to take the examination, and runs off to his childhood stomping grounds somewhere in the Catskills in order to lie low and clear his head.

What's the big deal about taking a physical, anyway? Well, Corky knows he's slipping mentally. He can feel it day by day. His old insecurities never really went away. They actually worsened, and now they manifest themselves through Fats. Call it a split personality. Call it schizophrenia. Whatever the case, our main character is crazy, crazy, CRAZY. He prays the trip will help his condition, and hope seems within reach when he hooks up with his childhood flame Peggy (Ann-Margret). She's in a relatively loveless relationship with the overbearing Duke (Ed Lauter), and is just looking for a way to get out. So is Corky. The two quickly come to the realization that they could run off and live a new life together. Alas, Fats isn't interested in a new life. The dummy wants to remain at the center of Corky's existence, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to win the battle going on in the magician's soul, including committing a series of heinous murders. It soon becomes apparent that no one in Corky's inner circle is safe--including Corky. The situation worsens when Peggy refuses to leave without telling Duke her plans. Too bad her old man isn't around anymore...

""Magic"" is pure magic, a vastly underrated suspense and horror thriller that undeservedly slipped into semi-obscurity for nearly thirty years. The film simply sparkles with creativity, excellent performances, and memorable sequences that stick in your head long after the credits roll. The idea of using a dummy to represent one half of a schizophrenic personality was a stroke of genius. Bolstering this theme are the performances from Anthony Hopkins (amazing) to Burgess Meredith (excellent) to Ann-Margret (also excellent). A great cast always helps make a film great, and ""Magic"" is no exception to that rule. Also giving the movie added vigor are several memorable sequences. I can think of three off the top of head. There's an amazing scene between Meredith and Hopkins where the agent asks Corky to ignore the dummy for just five minutes. The fact that our protagonist can't do it speaks volumes about his deteriorating mental state. Another sequence involving Corky, Peggy, and a deck of cards underscores his condition as well. Finally, when we see the dummy ""manipulating"" Corky instead of the other way around...well...prepare yourself for some serious scares. Thanks go to everyone, from director Richard Attenborough on down, for a job extremely well done.

The DVD version of ""Magic,"" brought to us from Dark Sky Films, exceeds expectations. The picture and audio quality look and sound excellent. Extras abound. We get trailers, an old interview with Anthony Hopkins, Ann-Margret make up footage, a still gallery, an interview with cinematographer Victor Kemper (who reveals several intriguing cast changes that make one wonder what the film might have looked like had they went with their initial plans), a lengthy ""Fats and Friends"" documentary, and previews and radio spots for the film. Fats himself even shows up to say a few words. I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to see this film on disc. I'm also thankful for the opportunity to commiserate with so many other folks my age about those horrific commercials. It's almost therapeutic to learn I wasn't the only one running for the door, hands clamped firmly over my ears and shrieking like a banshee!",1178496000,4,5715,4.816700610997963

480399,5,6302428939,"For some inane reason every time I think about the film Magic (1978), that song `You Can Do Magic"", by the group America, gets stuck in my skull on a continuous replay loop (`You're the one who can put out the fire')...argh...anyway, back to the film, which is based off a novel of the same name by William Goldman (Marathon Man, The Princess Bride), who also provided the screenplay here, directed by actor turned director Richard Attenborough (A Bridge Too Far, Gandhi), and stars Anthony Hopkins (A Bridge Too Far, The Elephant Man, The Silence of the Lambs).  Also appearing is Ann Margret (Carnal Knowledge), Ed Lauter (The Longest Yard), and the late, great, perpetually crusty Burgess `Buzz' Meredith (Rocky, Clash of the Titans, Grumpy Old Men), who's always been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw him on the old Batman movie as the villain character The Penguin (""How was I to know they'd have a can of shark repellent Bat-spray handy?"").

As the film begins we see a painfully nebbish magician named Corky (Hopkins) bombing miserably on stage during a club's amateur night appearance (no stage presence + an indifferent audience = lots of flop sweat).  Afterwards Corky, who suffers greatly from an overwhelming sense of insecurity, gets a piece of advice from his ailing mentor in that he needs something to draw the audience in, that being charm.  A year passes and Corky's playing the same club, but this time it's a packed house...seems Corky's found his charm in the form of a foul mouthed, smart aleck, extroverted ventriloquist dummy named Fats, who is a really creepy, exaggerated caricature of Corky himself (they even wear the same outfits).  Anyway, Corky's act proves popular enough for his crusty yet savvy agent Ben Greene (Meredith) to generate interest from a television network, but the mounting pressure eventually drives Corky to split town and head home to the Catskills.  Upon arriving he makes the rounds (the old homestead, the cemetery, etc.) before renting a funky cabin by a lake, owned by a woman named Peggy (Margret), whom Corky went to high school with so long ago and harbored a serious crush on...seems Peggy is married now, to her high school beau Duke (Lauter), but both are more or less going through the motions as the union has deteriorated significantly over the years.  Anyway, Corky schmoozes it up with Peggy real good (you never fully get over those high school crushes) while Duke is away, resulting in a renewed sense of self confidence, but the feeling is short lived once Ben makes the scene and quickly realizes his client has some serious issues...some seriously bad things happen, Duke returns home, and things get progressively worse, all leading up to a monumental meltdown as Corky struggles with the formidable will of his wooden partner.

In one of the featurettes included on this DVD a man named Dennis Alwood, who's listed as the `ventriloquial consultant' on the film, provides a number of facts about this feature, some of the more interesting ones being that Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof) was the original director attached to the project and Jack Nicholson (Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), the original choice for the role of Corky.  Well, Jewison dropped out (for whatever reason), as did Nicholson (apparently Jack refused to wear a hairpiece required for the role), and so, eventually Attenborough was hired to direct.  The production was still without a male lead, so Attenborough turned to Hopkins (on the stipulation he could provide an American accent), whom he'd previously directed on the film A Bridge Too Far (1977), which, by the way, is an excellent WWII drama worth seeing if you're interested in that sort of thing.  Also, Sir Laurence Olivier was in line for the role of Ben Greene, but due to illness he had to pull out, and so the role went to Burgess Meredith.  Given these various elements one can't help but wonder how different the film might have been had the principle cast and crew remained in place, but know, despite the changes, this turned out to be an exceptionally creepy and entertaining thriller with some truly horrific sequences.  Hopkins is amazing, not only in his role but also in his slight of hand abilities.  I don't know if these were skills he'd previously possessed or if they were developed during the course of filming, but they add immeasurably to the credibility of his character.  The other standout for me was Burgess Meredith, who played Ben Greene, Corky's agent.  Meredith was one of those performers who, while in character, made you believe without a doubt he was truly the character he was playing.  Such is the case here as was true in Rocky (1976), which he played the lead character's tough as nails manager.  The best scene, for me at least, was when Corky was arguing with Fats in the cabin, as Corky was falling for Peggy.  As the two are going back and forth, Corky notices Ben standing at the door and two things happen...Ben realizes there's something seriously wrong with Corky, and Corky feels the fear that comes from exposure of his dual personalities.  Both result in a very creepy scene as Corky tries to convince Ben it was all part of a rehearsal for his act, but Ben, along with the audience, knows better.  The overall intensity builds significantly after this as Corky becomes unglued and subsequently subjugated to the more powerful will.  As truly frightening as I thought this film was, I only wish I could have seen it when I was a lot younger, as I'm sure it would have resulted in some really funky nightmares, given the level of psychotic energy that comes off the screen.  If you're looking for an exceptionally intelligent, unnerving cinematic experience I'd highly recommend this one as it comes through with the psychological chills.  The build up is slow, but the payoff is rewarding, and where else would you get to see a half nekkid Ann Margret?  Homina, homina...

This Dark Sky Films DVD release features an excellent anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture along with a solid Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio track.

Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith.  He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see ""Fats"", but during some of the more ""romantic "" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.

Perhaps not, for Corky relies increasingly more on Fats to say and do what he himself could easily do, if only he had the confidence to do so. Fats brings Corky fame and fortune, but we all know money cannot buy happiness. Turns out Corky's fame is just the solution for his childhood romance, Peggy Ann Snow, whose wanderlust has not been satisfied by husband Duke's rooted, staid life.

When I was six, the TV spots, known to me & my sisters as ""The Dummy Commercial"" aired during our nighttime television viewing time.  The first exposure left me petrified.  Each succesive airing made me run as far from the TV as possible.  In recent years I collected the nerve to rent the film on VHS, hoping for some kind of reckoning with 'Fats'... but the mood of the film was bland compared to my intensely frightened memories.  Now, at last, the film with all the press material, including that startling TV spot is available on DVD.  My heart thumped in my chest as I brought home this DVD and explained to my roommates the significance of what they would soon watch with me.  I made them leave the room as I cued up the spot, turned off the lights and asked them to be seated.  I started the commercial and watched both of my 30+ roommates freeze.  I confronted that harshly lit face and did not look away.  I studied every detail.  As a 33 year old man, I'm still afraid of the 'Dummy Commerical'.",1152403200,26,1072,4.395939086294416

480405,5,6302428939,"Magic (Richard Attenborough, 1978)

Abracadabra, I sit on his knee.

Presto chango, and now he is me.

Hocus pocus, we take her to bed.

Magic is fun... we're dead.

It is likely that anyone over the age of thirty will remember the traumatizing television spot for Magic, David Attenborough's riveting drama about Corky (Anthony Hopkins), a magician who's on the skids until he teams up with a dummy named Fats (also voiced by Hopkins). When Ben Green (Burgess Meredith), Corky's agent, mentions that Corky will have to have a medical exam before doing his first television special, Corky flips out and retreats to his childhood home, where he meets up with Peg (Ann-Margaret), a girl he had a crush on in high school. Will Peg be Corky's salvation, or will Fats get jealous?

Adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, Magic is a wonderful piece of work that's finally gotten itself a good DVD treatment (including, of course, the infamous television spot). While Attenborough is usually a brilliant director, Magic shows him at the height of his powers. Every shot is perfectly framed, the pace is right on cue at all times, and he pulled incredible performances out of his entire cast. While the film faded into entirely undeserved obscurity, now it's poised to return to its former glory. If you've never had the pleasure of seeing this brilliant film, do so. **** ",1151452800,4,1373,4.8418803418803416

480433,5,6302428939,"Richard Attenborough's 1978 opus MAGIC is a minor masterpiece of cinematic horror that, while oft overlooked, arguably helped pave the way to the slasher craze of late '70s and early '80s (it was released within a mere month of John Carpenter's now better known HALLOWEEN).  Though Attenborough and scripter William Goldman--who adapted from his own identically titled bestseller--play down the grislier slasher aspects of the novel, they do generate genuine psychological terror with the help of an outstanding performance from actor Anthony Hopkins (yes, THAT Anthony Hopkins, who would later leave a bigger mark on horror cinema portraying another fictional loon, the infamous Hannibal Lecter).  Excellent supporting performances from Ann-Margaret, as Hopkins' love interest, and Burgess Meredeth add to the believability and, in turn, the scare factor of this delightful genre gem.

Hopkins portrays Corky Withers, a painfully shy but talented magician who overcomes his stage fright and ignites a meteoric rise to fame when he takes on a sidekick--an extroverted and bawdy ventriloquist's dummy he names Fats.  As Corky's act becomes more and more popular and draws the attention of big-time agents and Hollywood brass, introverted and insecure Corky allows the artificial Fats personality to take control.  And Fats will do anything--ANYTHING!--to help Corky keep his split personality a secret.

True, the plot of MAGIC is not totally original.  Not only had a few cinema offerings already told the same basic story--1929's THE GREAT GABBO and a segment of the 1945 British anthology DEAD OF NIGHT, to name a few--but TV's ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS (in an episode entitled ""The Glass Eye"") and THE TWILIGHT ZONE (in a segment called ""The Dummy"") also featured startlingly similar subject matter.  Still, MAGIC has two things going for it that make it rise way above the miasmic story line--the superb dramatic (and, surprisingly, ventriloquistic) talents of Anthony Hopkins, and a scene featuring the eye-poppingly gorgeous bare [...] of the beautiful and talented Ann-Margaret.  Seriously, though, the performances in MAGIC, especially that from Hopkins, make the worn plot seem compelling and fresh--not that Ann-Margaret's naked [...]don't add a certain allure--and fans of the horror and thriller genres who haven't seen the film already should definitely seek it out.

Fortunately, the new DVD release of MAGIC from Dark Sky Films makes it easier than ever for genre fans to see this cinematic jewel.  Not only does the disc offer a pristine widescreen digital transfer made from original 35mm negatives, it also offers some pretty cool bonus material.  Included are a featurette in which ventriloquist Dennis Alwood, who was a consultant on the film, discusses the challenges in creating the Fats dummy and in tutoring Anthony Hopkins in the art of ventriloquism; interviews with Mr. Hopkins; TV and radio spots in both English and Spanish; and much more.

In short, 1978's MAGIC is a great horror flick that, unfortunately, has been eclipsed by other more sensationalized genre films from the same era.  But thanks to the folks at Dark Sky Films, horror fans can now see a near-perfect copy of this wonderful film, and serious genre fans will definitely want to add the DVD to their collections.",1146441600,50,3309,5.326295585412668

His new found fame begins to overwhelm him so Corky returns to his hometown and starts an affair with a crush from high school (Ann-Margaret). It quickly becomes evident to his manager (Burgess Meredith)that Corky is mentally unbalanced.

A riveting thriller ""Magic"" met with hostile critical reaction when it was released despite a strong script by William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""Marathon Man"", ""All the President's Men"")from his novel, agile, suspenseful direction by Sir Richard Attenbrough and an incredible performance from Anthony Hopkins.

It's a pity it hasn't been remixed for 5.1 Dolby Digital but its possible the original soundtrack elements may not exist any longer.

Additionally, Dark Sky has produced a number of attractive extras for this terrific edition. ""Fats & Friends"" is a nearly 30 minute featurette on the film providing background on the history of ventriloquism and plenty of behind-the-scenes stories. We find out for example that Jack Nicholson was originally going to be cast opposite Laurence Olivier in the film and with a different director (Norman Jewison). ""An Interview with Victor J. Kemper"" the cinematographer on the film features plenty of behind-the-scenes information on the making of the film as well and it runs just over 12 minutes. We also get a vintage radio interview with Anthony Hopkins playing behind bloopers and cut sequences from the film. We get a second interview with Anthony Hopkins as well as Ann-Margret's silent make up tests shot for the movie as well as a photo gallery and the original theatrical trailers two in English and two in Spanish with radio ads.

480436,5,6302428939,"I have become convinced over the years that Anthony Hopkins could do one of those motivational infomericals and he'd still be creepy.

Here is an inexplicably obscure movie in which Hopkins is a lovelorn puppeteer with a tenuous grasp on reality. By itself, his dwindling sanity provides more chills than most modern horror, because few people can depict madness like Hopkins. Add a leering puppet to that dawning lunacy and, well... This is the kind of movie that makes you want to look over your shoulder every thirty seconds.

I saw it as a young boy and could not sleep that night. I kept imagining I would look up from my pillow and see Fats the dummy grinning from the foot of my bed. I revisited the movie decades later and the creepy crawliness of the film was not diminished. Fats still evokes childish fears and Hopkins is still a master of delivering that kind of unease. It's a lethal combination.

Magic is a movie that should be more frequently discussed in horror circles. If you haven't seen it, it's a must. If you saw it years ago, it's worth a second viewing. You'll still want to look over your shoulder every now and then to be certain Fats isn't behind you with that hideous, wide-eyed grin and some really vile intentions.",1145750400,3,1245,4.599099099099099

Anyway, this movie has been out of circulation for far far too long. There is just a vibe about it. Fats is awesome and Anthony is of course in another dimension when it comes to actors. I must add this movie has the distinction of having my ""all time favorite scene"" in it; it is the scenario which plays out when Greene (Burgess Merideth) walks in on Corky when he is having an arguement with Fats, the ensuing 5 mintues or so of celluloid should be bronzed as an example of how acting is DONE.

I have waited years for this movie to come out on DVD to once again experience a movie unlike any i can remember seeing as a child (or any point thereafter, in my life).

If you're anything like me and miss the horror of the 70's and 80's, this movie might well be one for your collection, in fact it always bothered me that it never earned a place in the annals of the great horror of that period. And now that i think of it, the movie might better be described as a traumatic drama.

The best way i can describe it is if you can imagine Jack Nicholson from The SHINING with a puppet (think for a second of what would gradually ensue). This movie is the sad and gradual plummet regarding a shell of a man tortured by his own inadequacies and just a hint of paranoid schizophrenia. Ill admit there are bizarre moments where one is left to question where the man ends and the puppet begins and which one is really pulling the strings.

For those of you not up on horror and are more in line with lets say Batman, if you know the villain Scarface (a pathetic ventriloquist, with a split personality, run by the more dominant criminal personality found in his puppet) Imagine if a movie was made solely on that concept, save for the fact that the puppet isn't so much a criminal mastermind as murderous sociopath.

The viewer watches wanting desperately to believe that there is hope for Corky (Sir Anthony Hopkins, which i will quickly add not only gave one of his first cinematic performances in this movie, but arguably one of his best since the LAMBS SERIES) but the viewer is soon left to discover............you know what better i not tell you (this is simply a movie that has to be watched, and i promise if watched with another you will be discussing it for hours).

One of the worst parts of growing up is becoming a cynic, losing your innocence and realizing the things you once believed in really aren't for real (i.e. Santa and the tooth fairy).

480494,4,6302428939,"This is an overlooked wonderful character study that should hopefully be out on DVD worldwide.

A synopsis of the film can be found in many places, but in short, this is a character study of a hapless magician, deftly played by Anthony Hopkins, who hits success when he becomes a ventriliquist with a dummy named ""Fats"", yet Fats may seem more in control...or alive, than one might realize.

This movie was a box office and critical flop when it came out, but I believe there are a few reasons why, and why they don't mean anything anymore. First, the film was released at a time when slow character studies were on the wane, and films like Jaws, Star Wars, and Halloween were capturing audiences attention. It also was frought with comparison to two excellent Twilight Zone episodes, Caeser and Me, and The Dummy (one of the series best). But more important, and most significant, is that the teaser trailer to this film was one of the most chilling, riveting previews in cinema history. A simple shot of a dimly lit Fats receiting a little poem, ""Abracadabra I sit on his knee. Presto-Chango, and then he is me..."" People saw this, were scared out of their wits, and expected a tense, thrilling film. Instead they were greeted with a film with a slow opening, and a gradual character study. But while that might sound dull, or drab, I promise you it is not. Once you get into this film Hopkins and Fats are compelling, and the tension at times is very thick and harrowing. It may not have been the horror film people were expecting, but I assure you that Fats would make Chucky pee his pants.

Of note: If you purchase this film here, or on eBay, you are very likely to get a full screen (Pan and Scan) film likely lifted at one point from a Betacam version for TV, with no extras, and the terrific teaser trailer absent. The film is still worth watching, certainly, but this film really needs the full treatment on DVD, widescreen, stereo, the teaser trailer, and commentaries by those involved. Maybe even by Hopkins, and Fats!",1133568000,,2031,4.589531680440771
480495,2,6302428939,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I'd heard about it for years, and being a fan of subtle horror as opposed to the
standard blood and gore crap, I must have unconsciously expected
that this was a lost gem with the great Anthony Hopkins.  It isn't.

I haven't often encountered films that are deservedly obscure but this isn't one of them.  It is really disappointing to see Hopkins' talent wasted on a one dimensional mess of a character, the schizophrenic Corky, and see that really creepy dummy Fats, and realize what this film could have been if any imagination or effort had been into it.

This was undoubtedly a chore for Richard Attenborough.  He had rich material, great actors (Ann Margret, the late Burgess Meredith and of course Sir Anthony), and emerged with an unbelievable clunker that at times borders on sheer absurdity.
The whole turn of events from the beginning of the film is beyond belief.  We first see that Hopkins' character Corky is a
short tempered, quirky man who has aspirations to be a magician.  He is laughed out of numerous clubs and booed constantly to his angry dismay.  Then just a little later on the film we hear he's been on Johnny Carson.  And yet he's still ""scared of success"" and doesn't want to make it big?
None of this makes any sense.

The ""love affair"" between Ann Margret and Corky is ridiculous.  All the sudden Corky, who is certainly no catch, decides to take up residence while hiding from his agent in a cabin structure deep in the woods that just happens to be run by the girl he loved in high school.  He behaves like temperamental, freaky jerk and all the sudden Ann Margret falls in love with him and wants to leave her alcoholic husband for him.  By the end of the movie he's killed two people and Corky still thinks he can just leave and have a happy life with her.

The only remotely effectual part of this movie is the relationship between Corky and Fats, and there are some chilling moments.  There are some bone chilling scenes as we see just how insane Corky is, unable to make decisions without Fat's illusory confirmation and constantly being tormented by him.  Fats is also amusing, though.  He talks like a little mafioso.

The ending is sad, true, but not that sad if you look at it logically: Corky has murdered his rich, famous agent and Ann Margret's husband, and I guess there's supposed to be some tragic irony that she wants to run away with him when he's dying in his cabin.  So what?  He would have been caught anyway and she probably would have noticed at some point that he was a complete schizoid, what with not being able to stay away from Fats for five minutes.  Even as a psychological piece this is a little disappointing since nothing is elaborated on.  Another reviewer mentioned that this may have been based on the Twilight Zone Episode with Cliff Robertson.  If that's the case, watch that instead, as I'd recommend that half hour over this entire film.",1104624000,3,2944,4.574427480916031

480498,4,6302428939,"I'm sad to learn from the other reviewers that the only version of the film available is an EP edited version; a bad dub with the language chopped up. Hopefully it'll someday be released un-edited on DVD, but the reviewers here have been wishing for it (and even teasing it) for over 5 years.  Doesn't bode well.

 When I first saw MAGIC on television as a 10-year old boy, I was scared-out-of-my-wits and couldn't sleep... despite not understanding the schizophrenia element. (I thought Fats, the dummy, had REALLY COME TO LIFE and was committing the murders.) Needless to say, I was completely freaked-out about ventriloquist dummies from then on; an abnormal fear that sort of continues to this day, as I near forty.

 The music is moody and the setting - with its bare trees and murky lake - is melancholic. Add a creepy-looking dummy capable of infinite facial expressions (and filmed like a living actor), and you get this scary and atmospheric film concerning a sympathetic but emotionally unstable ventriloquist and a tragic romance that's sadly doomed to fail. (One of the lovers is married and the other insane.)

 Anthony Hopkins turns in his usual flawless performance, this time offering us a prelude to his later Hannibal Lecter role. The beautiful and sexy Ann-Margaret is costumed in frumpy shapeless sweaters but is still unavoidably desirable. Here she does great supporting work as a woman trapped in a bad marriage, dreaming of a more magical love - perhaps in the arms of Corky, the fated main character. But of course, we know that's not to be... and it pains us.

 Lots of creepiness and doom and gloom perhaps, but nonetheless an exceptional film. The acting, the tragic love story, and the mood-appropriate cinematography combine for an A-minus movie.",1090627200,,1776,4.932885906040268

It was a bit more fast paced and compacted than the book, which I read less than a week before purchasing and viewing the movie. I have to admit, I am a little biased because I think that Anthony Hopkins is the best actor that ever has been or ever will be. But I truly think that this is one of his best works. Ann-Margaret is cool too, and I enjoyed the lovey parts between them. People on this site seem to want to describe this movie as scary when the only part that I jumped on was when Corky drops the knife at the end, and that was only because the thump it made was so sudden. Otherwise, 'Magic' was a nice, refreshing romance with a twinge of schisophrenic weirdness. But all in all, this rare find was one of the best movies, both that I have seen and that Anthony Hopkins has been in. Great job!!!!

480568,3,6302428939,"It may be worth asking whether ""Magic"" is the dismal failure critics have claimed, especially since some of the criticisms fall wide of the mark. We can dismiss, for instance, a critic who maintained that the theme of the film ----- a ventriloquist whose consciousness transfers to a wooden dummy ----- was such a horror clich that it made the film a waste of time.
That particular criticism is invalid, since few people launch similar complaints about the endless succession of films about vampires, werewolves, and Faustian scientists, or the many films on  alien invasions. The above-mentioned critic might retort that these themes are ""archetypal,"" and therefore merit as many variations as audiences might demand. But even that justification is pointless, since the essential theme of ""Magic"" is psychic duality, a theme falling well within the confines of traditional fantasy. In other words, the motif of the ventriloquist-and-his-alter ego, which has shown up in films as varied as ""The Great Gabbo"" (1929), ""Svengali"" (1931), ""Dead of Night"" (1945) and ""Devil Doll"" (1964) is simply another manifestation of the doppelganger theme, which is as much a fixture of the horror genre as any of the other themes mentioned.
So that leaves is with the question of treatment, or let's say: ""production values.""
On the acting front, Anthony Hopkins easily steals the show as the bedeviled ventriloquist, while Ann-Margret does a creditable job as his long-lost paramour, displaying a fair amount of ""brains as well as boobs."" But Burgess Meredith, playing Hopkins's manager, chews some scenery trying to look like a shrewd entrepreneur, to the point where his ""jokes"" fall totally flat (e.g., offering Hopkins a cigar, saying ""Take two, they're big,"" as if he's just served up a gem).
This brings us to the shaky script by William Goldman, whose talents seem to have eluded him for the bulk of this film. It's almost impossible to believe that Goldman was the same man who penned the scripts for ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""The Stepford Wives,"" both of which were models of cinematic wit. ""Magic,"" by contrast, falls apart almost completely: when we're not enduring the one-liners of Meredith, we're groaning at the ostentatious swearing of his protg's wooden sidekick. As Meredith says at one point near the beginning of the film, trying to sell his act to a TV executive: ""I've got a ventriloquist teamed with the first X-rated dummy on the block. Eat your heart out.""
Well, we're not exactly eating. Perhaps it's worthwhile, however, in this context, to relate an anecdote from personal experience, to help illustrate why ""Magic"" fails on a rhetorical level.
About ten years ago I unknowingly purchased an expurgated edition of ""Magic"" on VHS. Believing I had the original version, I popped it into my VCR, only to discover that all the X-rated words of the dummy had been edited out and replaced by words like ""darn"" and ""heck."" At first this seemed a good idea, since a lot of the cussing in the original version seemed superfluous. But as the picture moved along I cringed. Every time the dummy opened its mouth and uttered its sanitized lines, it became obvious how sterile the dialogue was in other respects. In other words, it became clear that the X-rated lingo was thrown in for the same reason as the nudging, winking performance of Burgess Meredith, trying to ""impress"" the viewer for all the wrong reasons.
This, I think, is the main reason ""Magic"" fails in the long run. Not that it's a bad film in some respects. The performance of Hopkins is brilliant, and the mere appearance of the dummy in many scenes, due to its ability to conjure up some incredibly creepy facial expressions, makes for some scary moments. The music score, for its part, is very effective, especially the ""demonic"" harmonica riffs that seem borrowed, to some extent, from an old Twilight Zone episode called ""Printer's Devil."" Atmospherically, in other words, the film is suitably dark and eerie in its more somber sequences.
But it's the pandering tone of ""Magic"" that ultimately undermines it, almost as if the director, Richard Attenborough, had no real interest in the film and so decided to resort to gimmickry to get its points across. On one level we're intrigued by the theme of a shy, repressed stage-magician whose ""dark side"" gets expressed through his ventriloquized alter ego, and who, during the course of the film, almost gets his girl. But when all the dust settles and the blood dries, we're left with the feeling we've been conned, so that what might have been a forceful dissection of abnormal psychology becomes ---- well, just a very wooden dummy with its guts pulled out.",1065052800,4,4695,4.96569250317662
480569,5,6302428939,"Anthony Hopkins stars as Corky Withers, a ventriloquist/magician with a pathological fear of failure.  When his life starts to become surreal, he looks up the girl he secretly loved in high school, Peggy Ann Snow (Ann-Margret), and, with the help of his wiseguy dummy, Fats, sparks fly between them.  But Corky's agent (Burgess Merideth) worries that Corky thinks Fats is real, thus setting off a deadly chain of events.

Anthony Hopkins is utterly convincing as the fearful and hallucinating ventriloquist. His manic performance is dynamite; he will break your heart and send chills up your spine.  Ann-Margret is good as the cheerleader turned haus frau, but doesn't look dowdy enough.  Ed Lauter gives an excellent performance as her brutish husband.  Burgess Meredith plays the sophisticated and worldly agent with regal aplomb and almost steals the show.

William Goldman's script is thrilling without resorting to gore, and the soundtrack, which is often simply a discordant harmonica solo, adds to the spookiness.  I thoroughly recommend ""Magic"" to fans of Anthony Hopkins and psychological thrillers; you will not be disappointed.",1062201600,48,1138,5.389830508474576

I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called ""Sad but True,"" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken.",1053216000,3,756,4.649253731343284

480573,4,6302428939,"I will begin by saying that I think most so called horror today is flat out laughable. They usually (though not always) contain overdone rediculous effects, incredibly stupid characters, no story, a high body count of people we never got to know, etc. This movie is A DOSE OF WHAT REAL HORROR IS. The story starts normal enough. (Thus it is plausible.) Anthony Hopkins attempts with success to make a living through magic and the use of a puppet (FATS). All starts well. But soon afterwards, we see that Hopkins does not want to be subjected to a medical exam. Why?  We see that much of his repressed feelings are voiced through FATS.  Gradually, Hopkins starts to lose control of the repressed feelings that he expresses through his puppet, and the puppet starts 'running the show.' (Pardon the cliche.) Eventually, Hopkins repressed side through his puppet causes him to commit murder. This movie literally slams most 'so called' horror films into the wall.  Horror is not from rediculous monsters killing through an even more absurd series of effects. Horror comes from realizing that something is plausible and COULD HAPPEN! Also, since there is not an excess amount of blood,  the murder scenes LOOK REAL and are all the more plausible! Also, a FEW bodies THAT WE GOT TO KNOW is infinitely more scary than a huge body count of 'barely knews.' Moving right along, character development is superb. We are lead into feelings for Hopkins, but we still understand that some of his actions are reprehensible. Meredith may have a dirty side, but he also has a really good side that really wants to help Hopkins. We may feel sorry for Margaret, but we probably will not forget that adultery is reprehensible. Margaret's husband has a brutal side, but we are allowed some sympathy for him, and his benevolent side is clear when he tries to save someone who 'may still be alive.' On top of that, the scenery is beautiful and dignified. If you like Anthony Hopkins in this, be sure to see him as the eventual King Richard the Lion Hearted in the phenomenal masterpiece ""The Lion In the Winter.""",1025654400,3,2088,4.759668508287293
480574,4,6302428939,"This review has nothing to do with the above pictured videotape edition of this film.  If the other reviews are to be believed (and I see no reason why they shouldn't) this tape contains a cut version of ""Magic"" which I must nay-say on general principle.  And now back to Matt's life:
I first saw this movie at about the age of six or seven when it premiered on network television.  Of course I'd already been intrigued and frightened near to death by the super-creepy t.v. spot that ran in 1978 (kudos to other reviewers here for reminding me of that little gem after twenty-some years).  While the film in no way dissuaged my intent on becoming a professional magician and ventriloquist, it did spook me pretty good.  Now, after over a decade, I finally decided to revisit the past.
While the film certainly isn't great, it is nowhere near as bad as some people would have you believe.  It also does not approach the level of banality to which Mr. Hopkins has, in recent years, apparently resigned himself.  While I have never been old Tony's biggest booster, I think a case can be made for his performance here.  If nothing else, the role is the perfect showcase for his acting style and those who go into the film loving him will only love him more.  Ann-Margret does a good turn as Peggy-Ann Snow and Burgess Meredith trots out his usually excellent curmudgeon bit.  While the whole dummy/ventriloquist personality swap is nothing new to the genre (""Dead of Night"" as well as a Twilight Zone episode starring Cliff Robertson come to mind as but two forerunners), this film is nonetheless dark, bleak, menacing, creepy, powerful and very scary.  It's not perfect.  The love scene between Ann and Tony is even yuckier today than it was when I was five.  It is, however, worth a good deal more attention than it has been alotted in recent years.  I'm praying for a DVD with the t.v. spot to hit the shelves very soon.
Some interesting points to watch out for:
*William Goldman's dialogue is just as fast paced and witty as anything David Mamet has ever written and really shows his chops as a screenwriter.
*David Ogden Stiers (whose presence pretty much guarantees watchability in any scene he happens to be in, though here he is only in three).
*Ed Lauter (if you don't know the name you surely know the face.  Rent ""True Romance"" or, if you're into bad movies, ""Death Wish 3.""  The guy plays the same hard ass over and over, but does it better than anybody.)
*Check out how closely Corky's face resembles Fats in the scene where he waits for Peg to pick up the wooden heart.  Probably the scariest shot in the film.
*The scene where Ben challenges Corky to keep Fats quiet for five minutes is undoubtedly brilliant, but is closely followed by the scene where Fats really exercises his control.  Corky screams with a migraine then crawls around on the floor on his hands and knees in a sicko-psycho-Simon-Says game with the dummy.
*Peg's closing line is, I think, supposed to be her own ventriloquist character voice.  I always thought it was a dubbing flaw, but now I don't believe so.  It's a very weird way to cap the film.
*Check out how Corky's entrance in the final scene with Fats mirrors his entrance in the opening scene with Merlin, his ailing mentor.  There are several similarities and ironies not the least of which is that in both cases Corky is relating false events of what just happened to him.
As I say, not a perfect flick, but hopefully the above list will tickle your fancy enough to give it chance.  And if anybody out there knows anyone at Twentieth Century Fox, please exercise some influence and get this puppy on a DVD.  Thanks.",1019520000,14,3658,4.593846153846154

Ample support - no pun  intended - is given by Ann-Margret as the love of Corky's youth, Ed Lauter  as her husband, and the always dependable Burgess Meredith as the  manager/agent who finds out too late how ill his star performer really  is.
