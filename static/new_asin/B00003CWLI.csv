1273570,5,B00003CWLI,"Well finally this movie is going to made available to the public!  It's been out of circulation since 1973, so the only way it could've been seen  in the last 30 years is through a theatrical revival. I'm only 23 so have  never seen this movie- and important one in the MGM musical history.  It's  the film that was the ultimate catalyst to Judy Garland's eventual  dismissal from MGM.  I've seen her footage from the film and it's going to  be great to now see the actual film. Thanks Warners!",965260800,7,494,4.411111111111111
1273571,5,B00003CWLI,"Betty Hutton has always been my all time favorite when it comes to musicals. I first saw the original when I was a little girl and was just floored by Betty Hutton. She is one supercharged dynamo and her performance  as Annie Oakley is the best! Annie Oakley was my childhood heroine. Even  though in reality she won her man, (Frank Butler)by defeating him in a  shoot out; even Annie would have appreciated the great performance Ms  Hutton gave portraying her. My interest in broadway musicals was spawned by  this musical. I highly recommend it!",961113600,13,547,4.71578947368421

1273666,3,B00003CWLI,"I would have liked this movie a lot more if someone other than Betty Hutton had played the lead.  Howard Keel was great, as usual, but Hutton's comic rendition was off putting, especially the way she over-played the part with her physical and facial gestures where she first meets ""Frank"" by dropping her neck and staring at him with her mouth hanging open. Other than that, some of the songs are charming  and  my 10 year old granddaughter enjoyed it.",1490745600,,452,4.625

I settled in with popcorn happy to see what was for me, a new musical.  While I discovered I knew a few of the songs, I'm not surprised that this one is not in the same league as Carousel or Oklahoma.  Even overlooking the political incorrectness of the American Indians, it just didn't have that warmth one would expect.

1273757,5,B00003CWLI,"What is there to say that hasn't been said about 'Annie Get Your Gun?' Betty Hutton changed the American view of women when this movie was released - a story about Annie Oakley, arguably the most interesting sharpshooter that ever lived. In taking the part Hutton replaced an aging and ill Judy Garland, who most likely would have been far to frail and old to create anything like the energetic and fresh figure Hutton brought forth. The film is loaded with some of the most lastingly popular songs ever to be written, and Hutton does a fine job of singing them, even if she wasn't Judy. I don't know many other films that are as entertaining and lively from start to finish as this one, and it's a terrific film to show children. Mine got hooked on it and watched it umpteen times as they were growing up. Even with the guns it's so much more of a musical than anything else it conveys a sense of fun not violence.",1419206400,3,915,4.3882352941176475

1273818,3,B00003CWLI,"On the plus side, it looks wonderful. The original three strip Technicolor process was impossible to beat, and this was filmed in that  fabulous process. The liability however, and it's a big one, is Betty Hutton's eye-popping, scenery chewing mugging, which at times is so irritating, she derails every scene she's in. The Judy Garland outakes were pretty much tests, but they do show us what might have been. She could act for the camera, and she was a natural, appealing comic, which the charmless Hutton is not. Howard Keel is the only person who acts like he's in a film, and not playing to the back row of the balcony, and he's his usual relaxed, terrific self. The songs are still great, however, especially They Say It's Wonderful, and Hutton is good in this scene. The reason the cast were unresponsive to her however, is not just because she was replacing Garland, but because at this time she was one of the most widely disliked woman in the film business.",1408924800,,967,4.654970760233918

1274018,2,B00003CWLI,"This was ""it"" for Betty Hutton.  A huge, Huge, HUGE MGM musical from the hit Irving Berlin Broadway show of the same name.  This was a dream come true for her: Betty Hutton at MGM.  She was very vocal about how happy she was about getting the role.  VERY vocal.

Of course, she got it at the expense of somebody else and that's the rub for me with this movie.

The Irving Berlin score is among not only his best, but some of the best ever delivered to Broadway.  And Betty Hutton can't sing.  Nor can she dance.  You have to wonder what Betty Hutton is doing in a musical in the first place.  She's crass and brash and more cartoon-ish than a living, breathing woman.  But here she is folks, center stage, aiming at the bulls eye of film immortality.  And misses.  Big time.

The film is a bit long, which, had Judy Garland been in the role, wouldn't be a bad thing, but Hutton doesn't have the personality to withstand it for the long haul.  The second half of the movie clearly drags, enlivened by a couple of numbers by the non-singer: Betty Hutton.

It's a big, expensive, splashy musical and it's a shame that Metro put the kibosh on Garland and went looking elsewhere for their star.  I think they should have waited, for in the few snippets of footage that we have of Garland attempting the role, she was clearly ""getting there"".  Rumors abound: she couldn't work with Busby Berkely (true), she was so drug addled that she didn't know where she was at any given time of day (false) and that she REALLY wanted the role but wanted to rest up before tackling it (true).  But it all fell apart for Judy.  She was out and Hutton was in.  Berkely was out (he never should have had this choice property in the first place) and Charles Walters was in.  Then Charles Walters was out and George Sidney was in.  The whole production was troubled and not all the fault lay at Garland's feet.

A big, important musical needs a big, important musical star and Hutton just doesn't cut the mustard.  Sadly, this will always be her ""big"" moment; had Garland done it, it would have been HUGE.  Dammit.",1335830400,2,2090,4.391644908616188

1274085,5,B00003CWLI,"I recently saw this 1950 delightful musical on TV and absolutely loved it.  Based on the 1946 Broadway musical of the same name and the real-life story of Annie Oakley who's claim to fame was her sharpshooting, the music was written by Irving Berlin and included such songs as ""There's No Business Like Show business"", ""Doin What Comes Naturally"", ""You Can't Get a Man with a Gun"", ""Anything You and Do, I Can Do Better"" and ""Got the Sun in the Morning and the Moon at Night"" and more.

Bette Hutton stars in the lead role and her performance is outstanding.  She has a freshness to her that is delightful and her performance is flawless.  However, I can't say the same thing for her leading man, Howard Keel, cast as Frank Butler, a fellow sharpshooter who Annie competes with.  His singing voice is wonderful but his acting was wooden and he just didn't have the macho male appeal that his role called for.

I'm also not sure that the story has stood the test of time although it can be viewed as a glimpse of American theater that is no more.  For example, it certainly isn't politically correct.  Not only does Annie have to make believe to lose a shooting match in order to get her man, the portrayal of Native Americans who are played by Caucasians with darkened skin are stereotypical and demeaning.

That said, none of these criticisms stopped me from loving this fine musical.  After all, not only is it a well-done story, it also depicted a time and a place in the movie world that has come and gone.  I'm actually glad that it exists in film form and will be able to be seen by future generations.  And in spite of all my considerations, I cannot but help but give it my highest recommendation.",1323043200,2,1705,4.482200647249191

1274087,3,B00003CWLI,"Annie Get Your Gun, 1950 film

The story begins with a song about ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody's ""Wild West Show"". Frank Butler, the best shot in the country, sings. [The attitudes then are somewhat different today.] A shot announces the entrance of Annie Oakley, who is rough and ready. She uses a rifle instead of a shotgun to keep lead out of the meat. [Annie's song is still funny after sixty years.] The songs tell the story, like some opera. You won't hear them on radio today. ""What's so funny?"" Can a little lady beat a man? [This is almost like a cartoon.] Annie is a sure shot and can match Frank Butler until he missed. ""It was easy as pie."" She is offered a job in entertainment. Is pleasing an audience a thrill? They travel through the Midwest. The Indians travel to another car. A stampede for supper.

Jake gets a reading lesson from Annie. People notice Annie now. Annie and Frank talk on the vestibule of the railroad car. Business is off, they have competition. [No mention of the economy.] Can a new trick bring in new business? Chief Sitting Bull knows better than to invest in show business. Annie gets top billing this week. A novelty act? Indians chase a covered wagon. We see trick riders. Annie rides in standing on her horse, shooting at many targets, and doing trick riding too. [A stunt double is used except for close-ups.] Annie is adopted by Chief Sitting Bull in a ceremony. [This dance pads out the movie.] ""Am I an Indian yet?"" The show travels to Europe to perform before their crowned rulers. Annie saves the Deadwood Coach. But the show isn't financially successful. They return on a cattle boat! A big show has big costs.

Back in the states Pawnee Bill considers merging with Buffalo Bill. Both shows are deep in debt. Annie puts up her money. She's happy with what she's got. [A poor example to others?] Frank and Annie meet happily, but argue. This leads to another song. ""Yes, I can."" The shooting contest doesn't go as well as expected, until Frank evens the contest. Annie concedes the match. There is a happy ending for them.

This is an interesting story that is seldom shown on broadcast TV because of its subject matter. Could they make such a movie today? No, for technical reasons: where will they find that many horses and experienced riders in Hollywood? Or the audience for western movies? Does most people's idea of western history come from show business entertainment? You will learn more from a history book about the late 19th century. Traveling carnivals used to feature shooting galleries for entertainment until the 1968 Gun Control Act was passed.

1274090,5,B00003CWLI,"This movie led the way into the big technicolor musicals of the 50s, and while it may not have the polish that would be achieved with later efforts such as Show Boat, The King and I, or Oklahoma, the movie does not fail to entertain. Yes, there are rough spots. Judy Garland started production in the role and was fired eventually for ""health problems"". That's a nice was of saying that alcohol and drugs were getting in the way, big time. Frank Morgan, the original choice for Buffalo Bill, died early in production. Berkley started the production as director and was fired. A second director was hired and fired without getting any film in the can at all, before the final director finally finished the film. Reports from the time indicate that Betty Hutton and Howard Keel didn't get along at all. And although the story has the names and the presence of sharp-shooting correct, pretty much nothing else about the story is accurately biographical. Jerome Kern was an early choice to do the movie score, but died years before the film could actually be made.

The film overcomes these problems essentially because it is hard to fail with an Irving Berlin score and Howard Keel's singing. In my mind, Betty Hutton is just serviceable as Annie Oakley. Her singing is just OK, and her acting is almost as over the top as Jim Carrey, but without the advance warning to everyone that this will be the case. A one star reviewer called her acting ""clownish"", and really had that point correctly summed up. Betty Hutton indeed hammed it up in the movie, but she wasn't alone, just the most noticeable. There is enough ham in this movie to feed starving nations for years, but most of it fits in well and is amusing.

I give the movie five stars because it does entertain in the way of major musicals of that day, and the show contains many old standards. ""You Can't Get a Man With a Gun"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", ""The Girl that I Marry"", and the endlessly amusing ""Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better"", are a few of the memorable numbers from the show.

The DVD contains some interesting extras including a couple of the originally filmed numbers by Judy Garland. Because of conflicts between the studio and Irving Berlin's estate, this film was not available for twenty-seven years during a prime period of network movie runs of musicals and the debut of cable and satellite TV as we know them today. Thus it remains unknown to many viewers who are very familiar with other major musicals of the 50s and 60s. Its definitely worth a watch. Just don't get your education on the life of Annie Oakley from it! LOL",1316044800,,2622,4.598290598290598

1274153,1,B00003CWLI,"I was introduced to this musical via the really wonderful CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Get-Your-Gun-1999-Broadway-Revival-Cast/dp/B00000ID42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Get Your Gun (1999 Broadway Revival Cast)</a>. The songs on the CD are great and very well performed.

So I wanted to see the musical, and the only available video is this one. From Annie's first number on, I was cringing the whole way through and only stuck it out because I hoped it would get better, and I wanted to see how the music I enjoyed on the CD was used for the scenes in the film. It was painful to watch. Here's what's wrong with this film:

1) It completely tramples on the real Annie Oakley. Annie Oakley was an amazing person, besides just being an amazing sharpshooter. She was very intelligent and well respected by her husband and everyone else that ever knew her or knew OF her. This movie lampoons her completely until she's unrecognizable. She is portrayed as a complete buffoon. Watching her in this movie was like watching the hillbilly version of blackface. And if it were any cartoonier it would be a Looney Tune.

2) It is racist. The Indians are portrayed as dim-witted, clownish children. And the whites around them treat them as if they were zoo animals. Even knowing that this was a 50s film, I was mortified.

3) It is sexist. In real life, Annie and Frank Butler joined Buffalo Bill's show after marrying. Frank Butler was fully aware of and greatly appreciated her talents. There was no vicious rivalry between them, as there is in this musical. In the musical, Frank courts Annie but treats her like a servant and wants her to be his `assistant,' and he gets very upset whenever she one-ups him. Finally, Annie loses a shooting match with him on purpose so that he will be happy with her and marry her. And here the musical ends, supposedly with them living happily ever after, he still an egotistical jerk, she still a submissive adoring female. What?? One of the greatest personages in American history has been reduced to this??

4) Those songs I love on the CD are done horribly in this film. I couldn't stand Frank's voice and had to turn the volume down whenever he was singing. (His squinty eyes and buckteeth didn't help either.) There are no subtle nuances of tone or pitch in Annie's songs either; every song by any character is just shrill. And some of my favorites on the CD, like ""Moonshine Lullaby"" and the slow beginning of ""I Got the Sun in the Morning,"" are not even in this version.

5) Where is the dancing? In a Western musical I'd expect some great dance numbers like in Oklahoma. But there were none. In each song there is just walking (or clowning) around by the soloist, or maybe a group of people singing on horseback. Really, really lame. Could they not afford a choreographer?

As Chief Sitting Bull says throughout the film... UGH!!",1304726400,6,2925,4.86144578313253

When I heard that Judy Garland was originally cast in the role, I assumed that she would have done a much better job that Hutton.  But seeing the out takes convinced me that she just wasn't up to it.  She looked wan and lack luster compared to the vibrant Hutton and even her wonderful voice didn't save her in the two scenes that were shown.

Honestly, when I listen to the prejudice against women, minorities, etc. in this 1950's version, it's not a 'play for all times' that offers enduring values.

""Annie Get Your Gun"" is based on the real-life story of Annie Oakley, the crack shot who was a member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and perhaps the first female superstar.  If you actually want to watch Ms. Oakley's life on film, try ""Buffalo Gals"" instead.

I was very young and could not remember much of the story but enjoyed the music very much.  Like many other baby boomers, I remember Ethel Merman singing THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS. However, being a kid from a small town in Iowa, I never had the opportunity to see her play the part of Annie Oakley.  It was a delight to view this motion picture production because all of the Irving Berlin songs were familiar (THEY SAY IT'S WONDERFUL, ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY, etc.) and I could now hear them in context with the story.  Although I am not too familiar with Betty Hutton's work, I enjoyed her performance which was a little over-the-top but appropriate for the period and this film adaptation. Howard Keel's voice is fantastic as usual.  Some viewers could be put off by the portrayal of the Native Americans in this film (think of the indians in Mary Martin's Peter Pan, ""Ugh!"") but again it was all in fun. Even the Anglo leads are characatures of real people. The print quality and color are good and the sound acceptable for a film of this age.  Regarding extras, it was interesting to see the footage of Judy Garland in the role of Annie Oakley as well as the scenes cut from the Hutton version.

1274189,5,B00003CWLI,"ANNIE GET YOUR GUN is one of the great musicals of the theater and 1950 film adaption certainly ranks with the most beloved movie musicals, a true classic despite being locked away for almost 30 years.  The movie stars the amazing Betty Hutton as Annie Oakley, a real woman from Ohio whose phenomeonal shooting ability made her an international celebrity in the late 1800's up until her death in 1926.  Annie's life story seemed destined for the stage and screen for not only was she a unique celebrity but she fell in love with the man who was considered the greatest marksman of the era whom she proved was an inferior shot making their love a classic plot for a battle of the sexes romantic tale.

This Irving Berlin musical meets it's perfect Annie in Betty Hutton, who captures all of of the shadings of Berlin's character - the simple illiterate, the loudmouth hick, the wistful lover, the professional showwoman.  Betty hits the bullseye at every turn.  Those who say she is guilty of overacting are completely ignoring the fact that character is very broadly drawn at times and she is only performing the role as it is written.  Betty Hutton is reknowned for her wacky, sweet comedy - she is totally adorable here and surely must have been an influence on Lucille Ball (who was actually a decade older) with her jump in the farce bucket with both feet approach to comedy which was extraordinarily rare for young attractive comediennes at the time.  And then there's the fact that she is a wonderful singer, not only delivering every gag line of Berlin's lyrics with perfection but also capturing the pathos of his tender lyrics as well.  Notice her superb scene late in the film when she mocks Howard Keel's ""The Girl That I Marry"" number - she start out singing it in a faux baritone then into the song suddenly realizes this ""girl"" could never be her, her vocals turn to a tender, heartbroken sadness.  It's one of the finest moments in the film and one of the most touching in any movie musical.

One interesting choice of director George Sidney was to have Betty sing several of her songs looking directly into the camera which is virtually never done in film.  One obvious reason for this is that these numbers are sung when she is alone so there is no one to sing to but the audience - which brings us into the film even more.  This film has to be one of the most colorful and fun movie musicals of all time.  The DVD print is gorgeous, the special features wonderful.  ANNIE GET YOUR GUN went on to be the biggest box-office hit musical MGM ever produced.

1274258,5,B00003CWLI,"A thinly plotted, often cartoonish, back-lot MGM musical (with lavish production values), it's common to give  this movie a pass primarily on the basis of its bright, powerful collection of Irving Berlin songs.  But watching it after many years, I find it hard to take my attention away from Betty Hutton's performance, which rivals that of Doris Day in ""Calamity Jane.""

Hutton defies the stereotypical glamorous Hollywood movie queen even more than Doris, slight of build with pugnacious, squeezed and terrier-like facial features, but nevertheless radiating screen presence that must have threatened to overwhelm even the largest Rialto screens.  She goes from ornery to dumb to feisty to romantic, yet never relinquishes an iota of her essentially androgynous, winning and winsome character.  Whether admiring her or wanting to hug her, she's got you hooked all the way.  In fact, I was more than a little surprised to discover that it's not the male lead but Annie who introduces the seductively soft and inviting ""They Say That Falling In Love Is Wonderful.""  When Howard Keel eventually joins her midway in the song, it's as though a bellowing bull has mistaken an intimate chamber room for the pasture.

No doubt some present-day viewers will be distracted by the resolution of the plot, which owes a generous royalty to Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew.""  But as with Shakespeare's ""tamed"" Bianca, the audience is fully in on the deception at the final shooting match.  When it comes to who's the real sharp-shooter, the true minister of munitions, the expert in the use of fire arms,  there can't be a shred of doubt in the viewer's mind.  Had the movie gone as planned, with Judy Garland playing Annie (she became indisposed by illness), the whole business could easily have become cloying and sidetracked.  With the irrepressible and irresistible Hutton, the big ship stays on course, moving briskly on its way to a dead-center bulls-eye.

Finally, kudos to MGM or Warner Home Video for the sharp shine of the print quality of this edition.  It puts the equally compelling if not better ""Calamity Jane"" to shame, even though the latter film came three years after ""Annie.""",1204934400,3,2186,5.033333333333333

1274260,5,B00003CWLI,"I have fond memories of this film, as this was our senior class play, with a great cast. I like Betty Hutton. A few reviewers don't. Either they don't like her ""overacting"" or her singing. ""Overacting"" is her comedic style, as is true of most comedians. Mostly, I like it, but her repetitive jaw dropping at the sight of Howard Keel, alias Frank Butler, did get a little old. Betty could sing rousing songs such as ""There's no Business like Show Business"" with gusto and expressiveness. She was also generally good at singing weepy ballads, such as the deleted ""Let's Go West Again"". Her voice was too weak in parts of the standard ""They say it's Wonderful"" and in parts of several other songs. She can certainly sing louder than that, so I must assume the fault lay with the director in not requiring a retake. She was great in the singing-shouting match with Keel in ""Anything You Can Do"". Perhaps Doris Day, who badly wanted the part, could have done almost as well as Annie. Judging from the outtakes on my DVD, Judy Garland could not. Doris got her chance a few years later, as Calamity Jane. Howard Keel, again, was her costar. Doris did a great job, but I suspect Betty could have done as well.
  Howard Keel was tall and handsome and had a great strong voice. I thought he had good chemistry with Betty, despite the jealousies of his character. He was the male lead in a number of musical films in the early 50s, including ""Calamity Jane"", ""Showboat"" and ""Kiss Me Kate"", after  a stint in ""Oklahoma"" on Broadway. Unfortunately, his Hollywood career then plummeted, as apparently the moguls didn't know what to do with him next.
  Yes, the ""Indians"" were sometimes typecast as ""wooden Indians"" or as wild savages. But, unlike the white male leads, Sitting Bull openly acknowledged Anne's superior shooting talent, yet gave her sound fatherly advice in her pursuit of a lasting romantic relationship with Frank Butler.  Some may see the idea that a woman should let her guy feel superior to herself as sexist, but, especially in the times of the real Anne Oakley, women were supposed to stay in the background. Even today, this is, unfortunately, often sound advice in many situations. Ironically, the real Frank Butler was an exception to this ""rule"". Women who are unusually talented or ambitious need to be smart in picking the right man who is comfortable in supporting their talent. Unfortunately, often they marry before they become famous or successful and then discover that their man can't handle it. Often, an older man who has already achieved success or fame, and is in a position to furthur her career, is the right choice.
  Of course, Irving Berlin is the real star of this production, with an unusual assortment of memorable tunes. Too often, less well known tune smiths and lyricists are lost to the public in the credits.

1274311,5,B00003CWLI,"I am as big a Judy Garland fan as ANYBODY, believe me.  But #1 - she didn't want to do the movie in the first place; #2 - she was lack luster and fatigued looking at best in the few scenes that were completed.  Sure her vocals were great, but we're rating the movie here, not the soundtrack.  Betty Hutton is a different kind of singer, performer, actor than Judy ... apples and oranges.  This movie called for someone of Betty's energy and her voice is perfect for the role.  Those who say she can't sing as great as Judy are making an unfair comparison.  It's like comparing Fred Astaire with Gene Kelly; BOTH ARE GREAT, but very different in style.

Betty wanted to make this movie desparately, Judy did not.  Hutton was fantastic in the role, period.  Too bad the studio, cast and crew (especially Howard Keel - who I really like in other movies and in Dallas) were so hateful to her just because they wanted Judy in the role.  That wasn't Betty Hutton's fault.  Actually, MGM tested their own contract players before approaching Hutton (June Allyson, Betty Garrett, etc.) but ended up requesting Hutton from Paramount.  Paramount got Fred Astaire on loan for ""Let's Dance"" with Hutton so that MGM could have Betty for Annie.

This is a wonderful musical and we should all just accept that Betty Hutton IS ANNIE OAKLEY!

P.S.  If you want to hear some GREAT singing from Hutton, order ""The Stork Club"" ... Betty will knock your socks off singing, ""Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief"", ""I'm Just a Square in a Social Circle"" and others!",1179360000,2,1533,4.584558823529412

1274316,4,B00003CWLI,"Annie Get Your Gun is the story of Annie Oakley (Betty Hutton), an amazing shot and a firecracker to boot. She is discovered by a travelling western show and joins up because she's in love with the star (Howard Keel). In the process, she becomes more famous than he does, and a rivalry begins.

Hutton carries the film 100% of the way. Her boundless energy makes every scene delightful whether you're laughing at her crazy expressions or her lively interpretations of the music score by Irving Berlin. She looks appropriately dirty for her first few scenes and polished and pretty in the later part of the movie. Despite the physical transformation, though, she maintains the character throughout the film. One can't help but notice that she overacts in every scene, but it is entirely appropriate in this musical comedy.

In fact, if one compares her scenes to those shot by Judy Garland before she was deemed too sick to do the picture, Garland's pale in comparison. Perhaps it is not fair to compare since she was ill, but Hutton proves to be the better comedienne.",1169856000,7,1068,4.767567567567568

Afterthoughts:  I just read several negative reviews about Betty Hutton's portrayal of Annie Oakley.  DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.  DO NOT EVEN READ THEM!  Some people are ""the glass is half empty"" type of people and negativity is contagious!  Betty Hutton's portrayal was, of course,  probably directed by the director of the film.  So it is ""the director's portrayal""; the director is responsible for what Betty Hutton did on screen.  And, this is not meant to be a ""realistic"" portrayal of a ""real"" person anyway---no one alive remembers what Annie Oakley was really like.  So the portrayal by Betty Hutton (as directed by her director) is as good a ""shot at it"" as any other---including Judy Garland's portrayal.  So,  I suggest you just accept Betty Huttons portrayal as ""one among many possible"" and enjoy what the portrayal does have---alot of comedic verve and vivacity!  Yes, ""the glass is half full""..and even more than half.... in this case.

And then there are some reviewers who criticize the show because Annie pretends to be a poorer shot than Frank  near the end to ""get her man"" by letting him win and thus showing  his ""shooting prowess"" some respect to make him feel better. I suppose for some people it is ""politically incorrect"" to ""play the male ego game"".  But, isn't ""playing the male ego game""  what it takes sometimes to ""get the man you want?""  So, wasn't Annie in the play just being ""realistic""?  Isn't criticizing this aspect of the play ""nit-picking"".  Ask yourself, could you even come close to writing  a  ""masterpiece""  like the musical, ""Annie Get Your Gun""?  If you couldn't do it, then what gives you the right to  ""nit pic"" the show?

And the Indian issue.  Some people feel Indians were disrespected in the show.  But, the show I saw has Chief Sitting Bull portrayed as giving good advice to Annie and being an intelligent person. In my opinion,  whichever way the Indians were portrayed in the movie doesn't change anything about all the positive aspects of the show.

My suggestion is to forget about all the nit-picking and ENJOY THE SHOW!  And there's alot to enjoy!  :o)  Email  Boland7214@aol.co",1156636800,9,2673,4.720173535791757

1274374,4,B00003CWLI,"I had only seen Annie Get Your Gun on television once when I was a kid and it was horribly edited to less than 90 minutes with commercials. I enjoyed the soundtrack recordings for the wonderful arrangements and Hutton's brashness. Finally, years later, the DVD is available. I shared it with my theatre classes and most of the students enjoyed the film and Hutton. I am mixed. Her ""Sun in the Morning"", ""Anything I Can Do"" and ""Doin' What Comes Naturally"" are charming and humorous and she is a delight in the first part of the film. In fact, her over-the-top approach mostly works for the character. However, the second half provides too many opportunities for us to see how poorly she handles the serious scenes. She is just not believable. Yet for me this is her best film and this is coming from a Hutton fan.
  The few scenes with Garland are facinating and disturbing all at once. Her voice is not in its best shape nor is her characterization. What a shame that MGM just didn't wait and use Garland later in the year. Her soundtrack recording of ""Let's Go West"" is more than this mediocre song deserves. The biggest sin of this film version? That from the beginning there was no intention of retaining the haunting ""I Got Lost In His Arms"" which would have been an ideal song for Garland.
  I have a few older friends who saw Merman in the role and they still can't believe how she radiated in the role. I bought the DVD for my neice and she said it didn't compare with Bernedette Peter's approach. Barbara Cook loved Reba Mcintire. For this fan of film musicals it is a quintessential statement of how ""bigger is better"" in Hollywood of the 1950s. Too bad. But Hutton never had it so good except perhaps for Miracle of Morgan's Creek.",1121126400,4,1742,4.503164556962025
1274375,3,B00003CWLI,"It needs to be said again and again and again so there is no more doubt: Betty Hutton is perfect for this role and absolutely shines in Annie Get Your Gun. After making a comparison with the two outtakes with Judy Garland, Hutton's performance comes out on top. Waaay on top. There is simply no one (except maybe Doris Day) that could've played the part of Annie Oakley with so much humor and life. While an amazing actrice, Judy Garland's performances just seem too bland for what the character needed.

The story is simple and mediocre, ending in a fairly lame finale, one where Annie is forced to conform to the norm and comes out second best while she's really nr. 1. (In reality, Annie beat Frank, and they still got married.) But luckily the movie is saved by the great music and performances. Howard Keel is good as the chauvinistic Frank Butler, Keenan Wynn (Charlie Davenport) simply oozes charisma and Louis Calhern (Buffalo Bill) is fine for what the part needs.

The DVD has great sound and great image.

I'm a bit disappointed with the extra features, however, which is my main reason for only giving it 3 stars. Where are the interviews, scenes from the premiere, small featurettes? A trailer, some outtakes, and a song without visuals simply isn't enough for a DVD these days (just look at the amazing extras on Lawrence of Arabia!). The intro by Susan Lucci, who played Annie in the Broadway revival, is unnecessary and cannot be skipped, which is pretty annoying.

In the end, this is a must have for any musical, western or just classic movie lover. Sit back, relax, and enjoy Annie Get Your Gun!",1116720000,8,1614,4.652631578947369
1274376,2,B00003CWLI,"Betty Hutton has a colossal amount of energy. She seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining. She's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers. Her voice is sturdy, durable, indestructible.

But oh my God, her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film (whereas Buffalo Bill, allegedly a larger-than-life character, looks like a corpse by comparison, and Howard Keel, in only his second film, must manage to act like these are human beings he's relating to).

Take a look at Betty Hutton's reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered ""a bit much"" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater. At best, her performance is clownlike; at worst, it's apelike. Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity. It's a magnificent effort, and a stunning testimony to her desire to please, but her comedy has no reality, no nuance, no connection to any sincere emotion. She seizes on ""hick"" and drives that into the ground, then she plays nothing but ""infatuated"" for a while before toggling to ""resentful"" and so forth ... It's a series of masks and set pieces, but it's not a character. Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life, but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie's rootin'-tootinest moments, and she wouldn't have neglected Annie's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes. Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy, and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character. Annie could be a wonderful character, a great self-conflicted mess of strength, longing, guts, femininity, skill, naivete and worldiness, all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop-eyed, crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet. I am surprised that Hutton didn't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out. Maybe they just wouldn't let her. The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh, oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide.

I kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on, and the memory of Betty Hutton's performance is branded on my brain, but it's because this performance seems like it's following the traditions of some other culture, some other world. It's like going to a sideshow.

That said, the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another, in wildly different styles, with effective melodies worth remembering. The classic tunes just keep coming. The movie works as spectacle and songfest, and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness. But if you're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations, you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes.",1105660800,9,3171,4.91044776119403

The colors are absolutely beautiful, and as is almost always the case with any Freed Unit musical, the production values are top-notch.  The unforgettable Irving Berlin score remains timeless.  Howard Keel is fine as love interest, Frank Butler, and Betty Hutton all but makes one forget that Judy Garland was originally cast in the title role (but in case you have forgotten, the DVD includes some, frankly, rather disturbing outtakes of Judy's aborted performance, including a brief but alarming temper trantrum).  Although Amazon identifies Charles Walters as the director, in fact George Sidney directed.  And his alternate track commentary concerning the making of the film, the film's stars, and some charming anecdotes about Judy Garland is priceless.

1274411,3,B00003CWLI,"For many lovers of musicals, the film version of Annie Get Your Gun is a movie that does not fulfill its promise. From the beginning, the film had its problems. Originally Judy Garland was scheduled to play he role of Annie Oakley, but her difficulties with substance abuse prevented this from happening. Not long after the shooting began, MGM realized she would more than likely be unable to complete the film. Since the movie's costar Howard Keel was a relative unknown, a strong leading lady was needed for the role of Annie, so MGM made a deal to have Betty Hutton star in the role. Betty Hutton's contributions were considered second rate by many, and people wondered what Garland would have been able to do if she completed the film. Actor Frank Morgan's death did not help matters either. Perhaps there are valid reasons why the movie was rarely seen for nearly thirty years. People knew the film existed, but it remained locked in Hollywood vaults for quite a while.
DVD viewers will be able to get the opportunity to compare and contrast. The DVD contains rarely seen film clips with Garland in the role as Annie. Viewers can see her sing ""Doin What Comes Naturally"" and ""I'm an Indian Too."" It could be argued that Garland's interpretation could have rivaled that of Ethel Merman, who created the role on Broadway. Viewers who see the clips, especially fans of Judy Garland, may be disappointed in Hutton's interpretation of Annie Oakley. While I am not the world's greatest Judy Garland fan, seeing the clips made me realize just how hard Hutton tried to portray the role masterfully, but she may have tried just a bit too hard. She is convincing in certain parts, but overall she seems to be trying so hard to succeed, she is somewhat unconvincing.
The movie does have merit, however. We see a lavish MGM musical with numbers that are typical of the great MGM films. Howard Keel is a strong leading man, and it is a film that can carry a person away to another time and place. The special features of the DVD alone are of great value and make it worthy to be in any musical lover's collection.",1056931200,14,2105,4.6310160427807485

At that time in her life Judy Garland would not have brought to the role anything approaching the energy and brilliance that Hutton brings to it. Also judging by the aborted scenes and the soundtrack CD Hutton sang the musical numbers much more ""in character"" while Garland retained her own voice (as great as it was).
Hutton was truly fantastic in the role and it is too bad that the experience was so bad for her but the backstory makes her performance seem even better. If Keel treated her as badly as Hutton claims then he should be ashamed of himself.
There are many great songs in the picture but to me the musical highlight of the film is the ""You Can't Get A Man With A Gun"" number. Hutton does such a great job on the number that I can't think of another actress who could have approached it. Robert Osborne on TCM said that when he saw the film in Seattle the audience in the movie theater broke into loud applause after that number.
Because Paramount has not done a good job of preserving and making available their catalog of films over the years many people today have no idea how big of a star Betty Hutton was. After becoming an instant star after her debut in ""The Fleet's In"" she starred in many huge Paramount hits throughout the 40s and early 50s. At the time of its release ""Annie Get Your Gun"" was the highest grossing MGM musical of all time and moviegoers at the time loved her performance as Annie Oakley. She received a star of the year award from Photoplay and was on the cover of Time magazine.

MGM's promising singing baratone, Howard Keel would be Annie's love interest, Frank Butler.
The legendary Irving Berlin (God Bless America, White Christmas) penned the incredible lyrics & music for this explosive musical.
Maximizing the TECHNICOLOR the vivid colorful movie sets & costumes exploded off the screen!!  Now this remastered DVD delivers this incredible color to our home as good as the original 1950 theatrical release.
NOTE: Even though this Musical is dated and reflects it to be a period piece we do get to see the world, Broadway & Hollywood of 1950.  So sit back & enjoy the entertainment, delightful songs & lyrics of Irving Berlin performed by the wonderful, Betty Hutton & Howard Keel.
Summary: Loosely based on Annie Oakley's (Hutton)real life with the ""Buffalo Bill Wild West Show"" & her stormy relationship with fellow male-nemisis sharpshooter Frank Butler (Keel).  The music provides us with toe tapping & knee slapping excitement.  The song & dance numbers are lively & colorful.  Eventually as all early Broadway/Hollywood stories go, a happy ending prevails followed by a grand finale number!!! Proving ""There's No Business, Like Show Business"".

1274507,1,B00003CWLI,"It was so disappointing finally seeing ""Annie Get Your Gun,"" after waiting for so long, because of Betty Hutton's bombastic and relentlessly one-note mugging throughout the film, which definitely deprives her character (and Irving Berlin's songs) of any nuances and realistic human emotions. In several scenes, her acting style is so out of sync with the other actors that she seems to be in an entirely different movie altogether (or better yet, in some second-rate vaudeville routine.) It's such a shame that Judy Garland wasn't able to complete the film. The two takes that she was able to complete, even though flawed and relatively unfocused on her part, displays an Annie that's infinitely more engaging (and human-like) than the over-the-top caricature trotted out by Betty Hutton.
On another note, I have to state this much more strongly than in the official Amazon review, many of the scenes, especially the ""I'm an Indian Too"" number features some jaw-droppingly offensive and negative depictions of Native Americans. Although I understand these scenes are a reflection of the times and the prevailing attitudes when this film was made, I still think they are very uncomfortable (and embarrassing) to watch for a modern-day audience.",1007596800,11,1243,5.251256281407035

1274509,4,B00003CWLI,"Well, it`s here at last. The long-awaited VHS of this smash hit Broadway musical.
I remember seeing it at the movies when it came out and thinking - what went wrong?
The tunes are great - the start is excellent but there`s no heart.
It`s too clean I guess and one-dimensional. Poor Howard Keel has not got into his stride as a movie actor and his Frank Butler is stodgy and quite unpleasant.
Our girl, Betty does her nut as usual but as she gets prettier so does her character diminish and she too appears brash and unsympathetic.
Of course, the songs are block-busters but I really missed Moonshine Lullaby which would have gone a long way to redeem Betty Hutton`s portrayal of Annie Oakley.
My favourite line is when Chief Sitting Bull says:
""Keep bow tight, keep arrows sharp AND NO PUT MONEY IN SHOW BUSINESS.""
Unfortunately the movie degenerates into montage sequences of little moment and a conclusion that depends on the woman being subservient to the man and 'letting him win'.
Based on a true story, it starts so well........but finishes like a damp squib.
In all fairness, Judy Garland couldn`t have cut it as Annie, as we see in a couple of her numbers before she was sacked from the production.",1007078400,4,1206,4.613953488372093

1274511,5,B00003CWLI,"I recently purchased a copy of the video of
Annie Get Your Gun starring Betty Hutton and Howard Keel.  I had seen it in the 50s when the movie first came out.  It was a favorite then and after viewing it now, it is still a favorite.  Hutton was dynamic.  She represented to me the true version of Annie.  I have seen the play on broadway with E. Merman, B. Peters, C. Ladd, and R. McIntire who were all good, but Hutton seemed to be the one with the most energy and portrayal of a real country girl.  Also, I found Hutton beautiful which I had never before looked at her in that light.  The video gave several scenes of Judy Garland  in the role -- what a disservice to a wonderful actress.  Those scenes should have never been released.  I do have a CD voice recording of Hutton and also of Garland singing the scores.  They both were good and are a pleasure to listen to, but Hutton was far greater to view in the film.  The music in Annie Get Your Gun is great -- comedy, sad, filled with love and keeps one singing them long after the curtain is drawn.
I am so glad the video was finally released.",1003017600,11,1101,4.1415094339622645

The chauvinism, which I'd forgotten, was disappointing. The 50s was a different era - immature in many respects, yet nostalgic in others. I understand the movie was intended primarily as a musical and comedy, not real life drama. I'd love to see an updated remake of the movie, stressing  sensitivity, intelligence and equality for all (women, all races, and the Native Americans).

1274585,5,B00003CWLI,"Finally available on video and DVD, Annie Get Your Gun is a wonderful movie musical like they don't make any more. The color, the production, the performances, and the music are terrific. Betty Hutton is perfect as Annie. Giving a performance closer in style to Ethel Merman's, perhaps, but Hutton truly makes the role her own. As Frank Butler, Howard Keel is in fine voice and matches Hutton's strong screen presence. I know it's not politically correct to like the way the Indians are depicted or the ""I'm an Indian Too"" number, but I do. The humor isn't mean spirited, nor are the Indians portrayed as total goons. In fact, J. Carrol Naish makes a pretty wise Chief Sitting Bull, helping Annie win the heart of Butler. Louis Calhern and Edward Arnold are perfect as the competing showmen Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill respectively. Keenan Wynn rounds out the supporting cast as Buffalo Bill's assistant, Charlie Davenport. Besides the great score and cast, the movie contains some beautiful color cinematography. There is a great shot from the air as Annie and Frank compete in skeet shooting that is truly amazing. A great example of what Hollywood was capable of producing during the old studio system, Annie Get Your Gun is sure to please most viewers. And if you're a Betty Hutton fan, you're in for a treat. She's terrific. Both video and DVD versions contain footage not included in the final cut; two musical numbers with Judy Garland (originally cast as Annie) and Frank Morgan as Buffalo Bill (he died before filming was complete and had to be replaced by Calhern).

1274586,4,B00003CWLI,"Annie Get Your Gun is a big brash bold MGM musical, with a score of nothing but all-time favourites by Irving Berlin. Howard Keel makes a very good impression as Frank Butler, and the script is fairly amusing, superior to most other movie musicals. However, all is not perfect here : firstly, the story has dated terribly in the last twenty years. The sexist message (a superior woman has to publicly demean herself to gain the love of a conceited male) leaves a sour taste when we should be rejoicing in love conquering all. And Betty Hutton... Well... Like Jerry Lewis, she doesn't seem to know the value of holding back and controlling the comedy. She's so broad and hyper most of the time that she oversells the material. When she DOES quieten down she's actually very effective. And when her comedy is delivered with split-second timing (her instant crush on Keel) she's very good. Unfortunately these moments are too few and far between. The DVD reissue is great, the extra's (outtakes of Garland, Hutton, and the recording session of No Business where Garland keeps messing up) are a real added value for musical buffs. However, there could have been more cast-and-crew bios. All in all, a DVD definitely worth the purchase even if the movie has lost some of its charm (though certainly not all). What I'm hoping for is a similar reissue (with deleted scenes!) of Ziegfeld Follies and The Band Wagon. I can't believe some of Fred Astaire's dance numbers were simply thrashed...",981417600,5,1484,4.80078125
1274587,3,B00003CWLI,"Like most film musical buffs not old enough to have caught this when it was new nor even to have seen it on TV, I have waited years to get a look at it. But ultimately it's a disappointment. If you happen to love Betty Hutton then you'll like it. But if she doesn't do much for you -- and she never has for me -- then her relentless mugging and stagey line readings wear thin real fast, and the film is in the end all about her. The score is great, of course, and most of it is here. But to see how Judy Garland rendered ""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"" in the appendix, even obviously too ill to pull it off with professional verve, is to see what these songs CAN become in the right hands. In comparison, Hutton is paint-by-numbers BIG. Then you have the problem with MGM musicals of this period -- the constant tug towards bland apple-cheekedness. Midway through, Annie Oakley is abruptly transformed from dirty-faced hoyden to glowing, coiffed MGM blonde, and starts singing her numbers in a drippy ""girl singer"" style that would have been alien to the character she first introduced us to. We condescend to the film to assume that this was ""just the way it was in old movies"" -- musicals like FORTY-SECOND STREET or even MGM's own THE BAND WAGON conveyed humanity with more nuance even within the strictures of the period. At another studio, they would have let Frank fall in love with something closer to what Annie really was, a much more interesting story. Howard Keel is good as always; the occasional number is not bad (""My Defenses are Down"" comes off especially well). But overall, you get a kid's vision of a Wild West show, J. Carroll Naish's rather funny turn as an ""Indian"", and a lot of forced, loud corn.
Where now is Berlin's other lost film musical, CALL ME MADAM? That one, which I have seen, holds up much better than this one.",980985600,9,1845,4.461538461538462
1274588,5,B00003CWLI,"I first saw Annie Get Your Gun in 1950 at a London cinema in England. Let me first say that I was simply captivated by Betty Hutton as Annie Oakley and being at the time barely 14 years old, I simply fell in love with her at first sight. To-day 50 years later my feelings for Betty have remained the same. In my view she deserved the Oscar for best performance for this movie -- it was simply tailor made for her and NO ONE could have portrayed Annie anywhere near as she did. She made Annie Oakley look bigger than life. Needless to say that this film initiated my interest in Musical pictures with its simple but appealing story and its outstanding score by Irving Berlin. The film adaptation is outstanding and this is hardly surprising when its producer is Arthur Freed (who is the best ever Musical Comedy film producer) with the finest MGM team and George Sidney who's delicate touch made it one of the best Musicals ever. I have been looking for a Video copy of this film for nearly 20 Years and with so many lesser films available I could never understand why this wonderful film was not available. I received my Video copy through Amazon to-day via a friend who ordered it in the US on my behalf. Of course I played the film twice through, thrilled that the copy was perfect. As much as I admire Judy Garland I am glad she dropped out from this movie since it simply wasn't suitable for her otherwise unique talents. Just as Betty Hutton wouldn't be suitable for the ""Wizard of OZ"" or ""A Star Is Born"" so Judy wasn't suitable for ""Annie Get Your Gun"". The whole film is superb as is its entire cast. I strongly reccomend that all Movie Fans who like quality films buy this cassette. Thank-you Amazon for making it possible for us to buy it.",980899200,10,1749,4.384615384615385

1274590,4,B00003CWLI,"Well folks, I'll tell you, one of the most ingenious action films to date, following up on the success of Annie: The Musical, Betsy Hutton gives the world her final masterpiece that isn't afraid of saying ""movies are awesome"". Some critics are critising the move to release this movie on what is called 'VHS'. Yet this new medium is being praised by technology buffs as being the ""standard of the new millenium"". And seeing that this movie is being released on the 50th anniversary of the first Major Motion Picture, I say kudos the Lucas for blazing a new trail in Movietekniks. Correographed by the same man who gave May_Tricks it's punch, the action in this film is non-stop. What may have been seen as risky choices for other directors, seems natural for Hudgson, but Hey, You know what I always say ""I like my movies, like I like my coffee... with lots of women in them."" and let me tell you folks. This movie does not dissapoint. There are plenty of guns in this one, and Annie's got one. When Annie says to Mr. Starbucks ""play it again, Sam"" and those credits rolled.. she walked off the screen and took a piece of my heart (god bless those surgeons who saved my life, Hutton you'll be hearing from my lawyers).

1274591,4,B00003CWLI,"THE major video event of the year, for me at least, is the long-overdue release of one of the great MGM musicals, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN. And Warner Home Video has done the release proud, giving us a gorgeous print in perfectly restored Technicolor, and adding in the original trailer and three unused musical numbers.
Because ANNIE has been unavailable for viewing since 1973 (I did see it around that time, but was only about nine years old!), movie buffs have been understandably skeptical about the movie's quality: is it really as good as 1950 reviewers said it was? That question can now be answered: it is!
The movie gets off to a rousing start with a wonderful production number, ""Colonel Buffalo Bill,"" and continues with one memorable song after another, all of them beautifully staged and excitingly performed. Special standouts are ""My Defenses are Down"" (the vocal harmonizing on this one is positively thrilling), ""I've Got the Sun in the Morning,"" and that king of all ""challenge"" duets, ""Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better).""
The performances are excellent, from Howard Keel, Louis Calhern, Keenan Wynn, right down the line. And I must save a special word of praise for Betty Hutton. Yes, she gives a slam-bang performance in her comic scenes (and is extremely funny while doing so!). But Hutton also shows in this movie what a sensitive actress she could be when given the chance. She shows shades of vulnerability here that were not always present in her other films. And she is especially fine when emoting through song--a difficult task. Watch her during the initial performance of ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" or during her solo reprise of that number when she is first being ""starred"" in the Wild West show. Here Hutton is not just belting out a song, but instead is showing us the inner feelings of the character she is playing. Bravo to Betty Hutton!
If there is an aspect of the movie that prevents me from giving it a five-star rating, it's the fact that Sidney Sheldon's screenplay ocassionally drags. This is especially true during the stretch when Annie is estranged from Frank Butler and she sails away to triumph in Europe. This portion of the movie could use more music. Ironically enough, this is exactly where the ""cut"" song, ""Let's Go West Again,"" was supposed to have appeared. MGM made a mistake in contradicting Irving Berling by cutting this song. First, as the ""outtake"" at the end of the tape shows, it's a lovely tune and is spendidly performed by Hutton and the chorus. Second, it would have given the movie a lift exactly where it needs it.
A final word: What about Judy Garland? As shown by the two musical numbers featured on the tape that were filmed by Garland before she left the picture, Garland could have made a persuasive Annie. Possibly working against her, though, were her innate sophistication (she seems a bit miscast as the ""hayseed"" Annie in her dialogue scenes surrounding ""Doin' What Comes Naturally"") and her ill health (the tempo during Garland's performance of ""I'm an Indian Too"" is horribly draggy, perhaps due to her lack of energy at the time). It's possible that Garland may have even been a bit relieved that she was taken off the picture.
All in all, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN is a triumph. It's great to have this movie back and available for viewing!",977443200,9,3327,4.767764298093588
1274592,5,B00003CWLI,"What a show! ""Annie Get Your Gun"" is an immense achievement, and one of the greatest musicals I've ever seen! MGM's lavish production with eye-filling Technicolor hasn't aged a bit and is a joy to behold fifty years later!
As Annie Oakley, Betty Hutton is nothing short of a knockout with her outstanding, energetic portrayal of the western gal who became known as the greatest marksman in the world. She is well complemented by Howard Keel, in his first film role, as the arrogant marksman Frank Butler, who carries on a very competitive courtship with Annie. The supporting cast, including Louis Calhern, Keenan Wynn, and Clinton Sundberg are just great.
And what a songbook! Irving Berlin scores perhaps his greatest triumph with ""Annie""'s popular score. The knockabout ""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"", the bouncy ""You Can't Get A Man With A Gun"", the amusing ""I'm An Indian, Too"" and ""Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better"" and of course, the glorious masterpiece, ""There's No Business Like Show Business"". No wonder this film won an Oscar for musical adaptation!
Also included as special features are the original MGM theatrical trailer and introduction by recent ""Annie"" star Susan Lucci, and three other surprises. Judy Garland, as the original ""Annie"" is shown in two musical numbers completed before her departure from the picture. Garland is charming and energetic with ""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"": ""Uncle Dick was always sick/But never saw a doctor/He just died at ninety-three/Doin' What Comes Natur'lly!"" and is even better with what I believe an even more exciting version of ""I'm An Indian, Too"": ""Like the Chippewa/ Iri-quaw/Omaha/ Like those Indians/ I'm an Indian, too!"" Finally, there is a charming musical number sung by Betty Hutton as ""Annie"" called ""Let's Go West Again"" (why was this cut?!).
This video version is just incredible. When first watching it, you really feel like you're participating in a special event, mainly because the film hasn't been seen in so many years. And watching the show and hearing the music, I sometimes feel that I'm not watching a movie at all, but a fantastic Broadway production. To MGM, Betty Hutton, Howard Keel, Irving Berlin, Arthur Freed, and everybody who had anything to do with the making of this film, I say three cheers and bravo!",977097600,17,2293,5.020997375328084
1274593,5,B00003CWLI,"At last the 1950 movie muscial ""Annie Get Your Gun"" is  finally available for a whole new generation and fans who fondly recall seeing it years ago to experience the magic of America's greatest composer,Irving Berlin(who in addition to the great score of this film brought us""White Christmas"", God Bless America"" and hundreds of others)dynamic stars, Betty Hutton, Howard Keel and a first rate supporting cast perform in one of Hollywood's greatest and at the time most expensive musical. The technicolor has been preserved in such a manner that the colors  are a joy to behold and the meticulous detail of the great photography of Charles Rosher and the costumes by Walter Plunkett(""Gone With The Wind"")and Helen Rose, who did the exquisite western costumes for Betty Hutton are truly a feast for the eye. This film showcases Betty Hutton at her best. She may not have ""voice of the century"" like Judy Galand who had to bow out of the role due to illness and other problems but she adds a tremendous gusto to the role plus an almost child like innocence to her early scenes as the backwoods, uneducated Annie. She is especially touching in several scenes in addition to her special gusto (toned down here from some of her earlier roles). Betty Hutton was one of the top stars in Hollywood when this film was released. That same year she made the cover of Time magazine and the film went on to be one of the top grossing movies that year. She went on to sing and dance with Fred Astaire in ""Let's Dance"" and then won the coveted starring role in Cecil B. DeMille's oscar winning film(for best picture of 1952)""The Greatest Show on Earth""in which she did most of her own stunts in her role as a trapeze performer in a circus.(both of these films are available on video Her last big film was ""Somebody Loves Me"" in 1952. She left Paramount Pictures due to a dispute over having her then husband direct her next film. She later made one more film in 1956(released in 1957 called ""Spring Reunion"" a small black and white film produce by Kirk Douglas'company co-starring Dana Andrews. Miss Hutton gave a sensitive performance in this drama about an unmarried career woman in her 30's ,lonely and living with her parents. Once the most popular girl in high school, she meets and old classmate at a reunion. The film gave Miss Hutton a chance to really show that she was a actress fo considerable depth. It is a small film but quite affecting. It is not available on videobut has been aired on TCM) Also in ""Annie Get Your Gun"", Howard Keel made his movie musical debut and it was an auspicious one indeed. The first of many great parts showcasing his magificient baritone voice, natural acting ability and his strong, handsome ,masculine prescence. Mr. Keel later reached his peak in MGM musicals in ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" and especially ""Kiss Me Kate"" (both available on video and probably DVD)The theatrical version of ""Annie Get Your Gun""had several songs that were not included in the film. One ""I'm a Bad Bad Man"" would have been fun to have had Mr. Keel perform and two sung by Annie were a ballad""I Got Lost In His Arms""(beautifully done recently by Bernadette Peters in the broadway revival) and the delightful ""Moonshine Lullaby"" sung by Annie to her little brother and 3 sisters with an assist by them . It would have been nice to have had Miss Hutton do these in the film. Most of her songs except ""They Say It's Wonderful"" are of the exuberant variety. She is a standout doing the show's greatest number ""There' No Business Like Show Businesss"" in which she sings with her co-stars, later a reprise by herself and a again with Mr. Keel. Before the film, it is enjoyable to see the original trailer(or coming attraction promotion) for the film, a short introduction and brief history of Annie Oakley and her various incarnations by broadway/television star, Susan Lucci. Shown are outakes made by Judy Garland before she was let go for the film. After the film 2 completed numbers  by Miss Garland are shown. She appears rather tired in them but her voice is just great and fine natural acting ability is evident as always. Finally a lovely number that unfortunately was later deleted from the film before it was released is shown for the first time. It is called ""Let's Go West Again"" with Betty Hutton. It is a good number , beautifully shot, sung in a more low key manner by Miss Hutton. Another interesting sideline, some of the original lyrics by Mr. Berlin were considered a little too ""racy"" for movie censors in 1950. For example in ""You Can't Get a Man With A Gun"",The lyric ""a man's love is mighty he'll even buy a nighty for a gal who he thinks is fun, but they don't make pajamas for pistol packing mamas"" was altered for the movie to ""a Tom, Dick or Harry will build a house for Carrie when the preacher has made them one"" Although a minor complaint it did cause a few of the songs to lose a little of their ""bite"".The film won 2 Oscars for sound recording and musical adaptation and it is obvious by the smooth , clear arrangements which give great justice to Irving Berlin's genius as both a composer and lyricist. I highly recommend this film for the entire family, especially if you are tired of the current films that offer nothing more than extreme violence, car chases, boring performers, gimmicky special effects, blatant sexuality etc. run and get this film. Betty Hutton was recently interviewed by the brilliant Robert Osborne on TCM(the Turner Classic Movies cable channel) and if they see my review I want to say ""Bravo"" to both of you for an outstanding one hour conversation about Miss Hutton's life and career. I hope that Betty Hutton will continue to give future interviews and lectures . She is a remarkable ""survivor""who gives so much of herself to her audience. It is not surprising that she got her start on the Broadway stage and after her movie career continued appearing all over The  USA and Europe in concerts and and theatrical productions to sellout audiences until personal problems in the 1960's caused her to stop performing until she made a brief return to Broadway in 1980(filling in for Alice Ghostley) in the role of Miss Hannigan in ""Annie"" ( muscial based on Little orphan Annie)",976665600,3,6246,4.665154264972776
1274604,5,B00003CWLI,"Like several other reviewers here, this was the first movie musical I ever saw in a theater back in l950 and to this day, I've never forgotten the exhiliration of watching Betty Hutton portray Annie Oakley, the very hunky Howard Keel as Frank Butler and the magnficent Technicolor hues of Betty's costumes. Those glowing reds and blues and greens are just as beautiful now on DVD as they were back in l950. But there are some serious questions about this DVD's program of extras: why was Susan Lucci, a TV performer who played Annie on Broadway, chosen to be the hostess of the history of Annie Oakley when Betty Hutton and especially Howard Keel are still very much alive and kicking? Why wasn't there a 'Making-of-the-Movie'documentary, like the one made for another fantastic MGM musical, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" with the documentary showcasing everybody from Jane Powell, Howard Keele, choreographer Michael Kidd to several extras and dancers? ""Annie"" was certainly one of MGM's biggest grossing movies but the only extras you get are the trailer (big deal)and two scenes of Judy Garland, looking horrible and sounding worse, before she was fired. It's obvious that Garland could never have completed the grueling work demanded of this role. ""Seven Brides"" was presented on DVD with the loving care of someone and I've watched the documentary about a dozen times in just two weeks. The same should have been done for this DVD version of ""Annie."" Why couldn't they have included Betty Hutton's interview with the host of Turner Classic Movies about the terrible problems she encountered when taking over the role of Annie from Garland? How about footage of the premieres (Betty complains she was never even invited to the NY premiere by MGM. If this is true, what was the reason? Who were her enemies on the set?)Anyway, let's rejoice that at last, after mysterious restraints and roadblocks, we've finally got Betty Hutton and Howard Keele back at their peaks. Somebody at Turner's, which owns all these great classics, should really get on the ball, though, and start treating these masterpieces with care. Just look at Turner's DVD version of ""Gone With the Wind."" This greatest of all movies doesn't have a single extra--except for a trailer. Wow. Wonderful treatment of HOllywood's all-time movie masterpiece. But gee, these movies are real old, you know, and therefore they shouldn't get the razzle-dazzle extras package like ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Mission Impossible: II"". Wake up Turner and Warners and DVD producers. We want our classics presented with archival materials, outakes, screen tests, etc.",975974400,17,2624,5.090487238979119

1274606,4,B00003CWLI,"I truly miss the traditional Broadway/Hollywood musical, a true American art form that has virtually disappeared. As a collector I was delighted when I received Annie Get Your Gun a couple of days ago.  I was not disappointed! Besides the delightful score, Annie Get Your Gun, being Irving Berlin's last musical, has  historic significance.  The theme of this almost 50 year old musical weaves nicely into the modern feminist agenda, and for that reason is very timely. Betty Hutton did a great job. I remember her movies from a time when she and I were much younger. I did not appreciate then the quality of her dance movements, but they are a thing to behold.  Betty's singing voice is not the best, but this does not detract.  What the viewer is seeking is not operatic quality but personality projection and delight and there is plenty of that.  Howard Keel demonstrates that he was one of the great non-operatic singers of the movies. I will keep this one in my collection and recommend it.",974505600,7,995,4.722543352601156

1274608,5,B00003CWLI,"Until now, my previous reviews of AGYG have been based on my recollection of last seeing this musical more than 25 years ago. Happily, my memory did not betray me, as this film is indeed as wonderful as I recall it. The story, in case you're not familiar, concerns a backwoods sharp-shooting bumpkin named Annie Oakley. Annie stumbles upon Buffalo Bill's traveling Wild West Show in her hometown. After the local hotel owner realizes her shooting ability, her persuades her to try for the prize money by challenging a Mr. Frank Butler, one of Buffalo Bill's stars, to a trap shooting contest. After Annie defeats Frank, Buffalo Bill persuades her to join his show in order to boost sagging sales. Although his pride is wounded, Frank reluctantly agrees to have Annie join the troop, but only as his assistant. Annie quickly falls in love with Frank, but his ego stands in the way of true romance. He likes Annie, but only if she remains a second banana in the show. Buffalo Bill convinces Annie that if she performs some fancy shooting during the upcoming Wild West show, Frank will be hers for the taking. Instead, Annie's performance sends the jealous Frank reeling. He leaves the show, which crushes Annie. Despite her grief, Annie stays with Buffalo Bill's show and becomes a huge star. At the conclusion of the film Annie does ""get her man (Frank) with a gun"", but I won't tell you how. AGYG has a beguiling story, a tuneful score, colorful costumes, humor, and a tinge of melancholy thrown in for good measure. The DVD transfer is beautiful, but not without some minor editing glitches which can be overlooked. However, I was a little disappointed over the lack of closing credits that I'm sure the theatrical release contained. Quibbles aside, this delightful musical belongs in everyone's home video library. One of MGM's greatest!
UPDATE: Since getting a LCD High Def TV it has become sadly apparent that Annie Get Your Gun can use a remastering. The picture looks soft and fuzzy, as well as out of focus at times. Some bad splices also need to be cleaned up. The initial DVD was obviously prepared in great haste with little regard to presenting this classic musical in the best possible light. Hopefully a remastered version is forthcoming.",974419200,2,2251,4.804123711340206
1274609,5,B00003CWLI,"I first saw this movie in 1950 when I was nine years old. This is the movie that initiated my love of musicals of all kinds. Having searched for the past 20+ years for a video, I was thrilled to finally see it released. While Judy Garland was my first favorite singer ever, followed by ""Barbra"" in the 60s, Betty Hutton is the ONLY ONE for the role of Annie Oakley. The songs from the movie are the best and I have remembered all of them all this time (a few words forgotten here and there). I strongly feel that it is Betty Hutton's shining glory as an actress and singer, and recently having learned of all the issues involved with her replacing the great Judy Garland as the star, it only reinforces the fact that Betty Hutton was the ONLY person (professionally and personally) to play this part. I might add that, Howard Keel as Frank Butler was my heart throb for more then 20 years. A voice as good, if not better then Gordon MacRae who is also a long-time favorite. I'm so happy to hear that Betty is alive and doing so well, having turned her life around.",974419200,9,1064,4.298507462686567
1274610,3,B00003CWLI,"I received the ANNIE GET YOUR GUN DVD in the mail last night and I have to admit that I immediatly opened and began to watch it. I didn't start the movie, I watched the outtakes and the intro. with Susan Lucci and then began the movie. I loved Judy Garland's interpretation of the role. I just have to say that it was Judy (who really reminded me of Liza playing ANNIE) and there wasn't a thick character there for her. But her wide-eyed charm is ever captivating. Butty Hutton is another story. I was driven crazy by her not being able to keep up with the music, meaning, I know she was lip-syncing to her own singing, but she was way off. I found many glitches in the movie, for instance, when Betty began ""You Can't Get a Man..."" it showed her from one angle and she opened her mouth to begin singing. Then it snapped to another angle and her mouth was closed and then she opened her mouth and began singing. I hated Howard Keel, though. His voice was too old timy and I missed the Tom Wopat charm that Frank enthuses/radiates. Tom Wopat has the been one of the best Frank's ever. His voice was perfect for the role. Keel was a little too operetic. Hutton and Keel were singers, no one else in the show was a good singer. The supporting characters spoke their songs more than they sung. I saw the out take with Frank Morgan as Buffalo Bill and all I can say is, I WISH HE HAD BEEN ALIVE TO FINISH THE MOVIE. He has that caring quality in all his characters and he is just great. One thing that I can say about the movie is that it gives great images. The filming, with the exception of mistakes, and the dance sequence and stunt sequences are wonderful. Top of the line you could probably say. I love that quality of it. I love ""Anything you Can Do"" and ""Sun in the Morning"" was pretty fun. I wished that ""Old Fashioned Wedding"" had been written so it could have been in the movie, I love that song. I also missed ""Moonshine Lullaby"" and ""I got Lost in his arms,"" a great ANNIE song that Bernadette radiated in when she sung it. All in all, I would have to say that I will watch it again. It gives some great images and the acting is superb. Hutton voice was annoying at first, but when she became a lady all of her songs were more mature and her voice wasn't as squeaky. I would suggest you buy this movie. This is the first time it has been released since 1973 and I think that is reason enough to pick it up and watch it. Just be aware that it is not the best movie in the world. It has it's moment, but so do all great movies!",974419200,4,2533,4.139959432048681
1274611,5,B00003CWLI,"After years of legal wrangling, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN is finally available on video and it was worth the wait. Those who watched the reclusive Betty Hutton interviewed recently by Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies will recall Hutton's recollection of the cast's rudeness to her during the filming. Indeed, she called it the worst experience of her life and cited it as the major reason for her retirement from picture making. According to Hutton, MGM didn't even invite her to the premiere in New York. Knowing that, it is difficult to watch her performace as Annie Oakley without noting the vulnerability of her portrayal. Yes, she is broad and hammy but she delivers the goods in one of the most enjoyable MGM musicals I've ever seen. What a treat to have it back, not only for film buffs but for budding film scholars to study as part of the canon of the Freed Unit's many celebrated achievements. The added goodies are also intriguing. Whatever Garland's personal demons, we now have irrefutable evidence that her Annie would have  been a disaster. Hutton has the energy and the spunk for this larger than life character of the Old West.",974332800,8,1144,4.777777777777778
1274612,4,B00003CWLI,"Warners promised ""production dailies"" as well as a ""lobby card reprint"" but didn't deliver.  We DO get the two cut Garland numbers (and the cut Hutton number), but Judy's version of ""I'm An Indian Too"" is trimmed so much, and without the production dailies, one never gets a sense of just how difficult it was to piece the number together from all the short takes they had to endure due to her illness.  ""Colonel Buffalo Bill"" is an AUDIO outtake, not visual.  And one of the headings in the ""special features"" section reads that it is an audio outtake of ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" when actually, and without any explanation, it is really the cut version of ""Colonel Buffalo Bill,"" ""Let's Go West Again (Hutton),"" and ""There's No Business Like Show Business (Garland).""  And due to the limitations of the DVD, one cannot ""fast forward"" through the songs to listen to just one - you must hear all three in that order or not at all.
After all this time, and all the fans out there waiting for this to come out, Warners once again gets cheap at the last minute.
The film itself is fine!  Very nice transfer and Betty Hutton does a good job as Annie.  She's made to mug a little too much in parts, and at times the film does have a sense of having been rushed (witness the buildup to Annie's first big moment in the spotlight in a cute outfit, then suddenly, her big moment comes in a completely different outfit).  But all that aside, there's not denying that this is a fun and breezy musical.  It's a perfect example of just how ""well oiled"" a machine MGM was in 1949/1950 - especially when it came to musicals.
And it's nice to be able to see the Garland and Hutton versions of ""Doin What Comes Natur'lly"" back to back.  One really gets a sense of how different Garland would have been.  It's too difficult to say whether she would have been better or not, as Garland fans have argued over the years, since these outtakes show an obviously tired Judy who is missing that special ""sparkle"" she usually had.  However it is aparrant that she would have humanized the character.
Overall the film gets 4 stars out of 5, but the DVD only gets 3.
Warners needs to stop advertising lots of extras on their DVDs then bailing out at the last minute!",974246400,3,2253,4.457420924574209
1274613,5,B00003CWLI,"After waiting a lifetime it seems to see this film and also having heard the Betty and Judy versions of the soundtrack but never seeing the performances.  I must say that I am so happy to have finally seen Betty Hutton in the newly restored edition of ""Annie Get your Gun"" and also put to rest any resentment I or anyone else may have had about her playing Annie.  SHE IS BRILLIANT!  Her acting and singing is great and her emotional connection with the charater is really there.  That first time she is in a scene with Howard Keel and he's singing the song ""The Girl that I Marry""  whatch Betty's eyes well up when her character Annie realizes she isn't even in the game.  It's great acting for such a fluff part.  Which proves that clearly Betty was the best person to play Annie at the time.  Garland was undoubtedly the greatest film musical star ever committed to film but was unfortunately miscast and I believe knew it and undermined herself to the point of being fired.  In her own mind she must have known it wasn't for her.  At this point in her career she was far too elegant and refined to pull it off and more interested in dramatic things.  Betty on the other hand has that tomboyish quality that was perfect for such a physically demanding role.  I really do believe that Betty did suffer on the set from co-workers who wanted Garland, from stories I've heard over the years from people who worked on the film.  So when she was interviewed by Robert Osborne recently on TCM and mentioned the controversy I was not surprised at all.  I just wish the men involved who are still around today would admit the way they treated her and apologize publicly.  No spoilers here.  Just watch the film and enjoy. With the film newly restored and sound enhanced you can't help but love every bit of this film.  The outtakes are a revelation and further prove MGM made the right decision in casting Betty.

7917620,5,B00003CWLI,"Review of Annie Get Your Gun
Hot Toasty Rag, Feb 20, 2018

If you grew up listening to the Broadway soundtrack of Annie Get Your Gun, youll come to associate Ethel Mermans fantastic, belting voice with Irving Berlins songs. Its completely understandable that youd watch the film adaptation and be disappointed by Betty Huttons less-than-stellar vocals. But I appeal to you, as a fellow musical lover, to give the film a fair shot.

The original casting choice for the tomboy cowgirl Annie Oakley was Judy Garland, and if you buy the DVD, you can watch her perform a couple of songs. Only after watching the outtakes can you see just how far she would have dragged the film down. Her energy was low, her timing was slow, she was too old for the part, and her expressions were too troubled. Annie is supposed to be innocent, fresh, exciting, and endearing: all qualities a 1950 Judy Garland wasnt. Betty Hutton might not have been able to sing all the songs as well as the immortal Ethel Merman, but she was young, innocent, fresh, exciting, and endearing. Her energy was off the charts! And while the part was practically made for Doris DayWarner Brothers wrote and filmed a knock-off version, Calamity Jane, for the blonde star three years laterBetty was an excellent choice. She made the audience care about her, and she delivered the lines with such sincerity, she even made the audience take the silly story seriously.

Howard Keel played the big-voiced, ridiculously handsome, self-assured Frank Butler. Every time Betty looks at him during their first few scenes together, her jaw drops and she turns to jelly. Its very funny, and Im sure youll find yourself mimicking herI did! Hes so incredibly handsome and charming in this movie, its no wonder he was cast in basically the same role in Calamity JaneHollywood just didn't want him to take his cowboy hat off! His handsomeness asideI know, its impossible not to noticehe does a very good job in what was only his second film!

Louis Calhern plays Buffalo Bill, and when he meets Betty, she asks if hes really the famous Colonel. He says he is, and hes so convincing throughout the movie, I found myself believing that he really was! I didn't even recognize the veteran actor until the movie was almost over, and he actually looked handsome and distinguished in his long hair and goatee. Also, he was very warm-hearted, a choice of delivery that was welcomed, since Betty wasn't often met with warmth throughout the film.
All in all, this is a great film adaptation of a Broadway show, combining elements that seem to come directly from the stagehammy but lovable songswith additions that could never have been seen onstagerodeo performances. The production values are very good, including breathtaking costumes by Walter Plunkett. Give it a try, even if you're skeptical of Betty Hutton.

We have only been shown the clip here and there from this performance.  Judy is vibrant and the color of the film has been fixed up and glows with beautiful color.  It has been said that the Busby Berkley version had no depth, and looked as a stage show.  No/Yes.  When you view the scene in restored color it appears to my eye's as if Berkley intended to have the film look as though it was performed on a stage, and very beautiful.  Garland is pretty and young in the face.  Photographed beautifully overcome by Indians.  She becomes an Indian too.
I adore Betty Hutton.  She is all there,  but the director and the vision as to what the film would be was changed.  Amazing that the film did so well at the box office.  Look at Betty Hutton in the Perils of Pauline.  The Greatest show on earth, and Somebody loves me.  Both so young.  Judy fired at 28. and Betty Hutton a year younger.

I knew nothing about her except reading somewhere that she was one of the most popular performers in the 40's and early 50's and I wanted to see why. So I got this DVD. I was blown away by her performance. She put everything into this and it shows. Love her different singing approaches to the songs, some funny, some rousing, and some heartbreaking and sweet. When I watched it a second time I focused on her eyes and they tell so much about the scene. They have a light in them! I think she is an excellent actress. When she was on-screen I was riveted. In fact, when there was a scene without her I could not wait for her to come back. She's exuberant and endearing and there's a sense of joy watching her. Just a marvelous entertainer! My favorite number is the Doin What Comes Naturally one. She really puts a lot into this bit and its hilarious! That said, she had a terrific voice and I loved all her numbers. Of course this is a famous musical with many classic songs by Irving Berlin and they are presented just great on this DVD. The DVD itself is high quality and has great sound and color. The movie is fast paced and fun throughout. Wonderfully entertaining! But, to me, its Betty Hutton who makes it truly special. And this is coming from someone who knew nothing about her before. I just feel good every time I watch it- which is about 10 times now! LOL! By the way, I don't re-watch movies like this, I just haven't seen another movie that was as entertaining as this.
