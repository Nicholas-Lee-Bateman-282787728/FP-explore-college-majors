7988526,5,B000092OMA,"My dog ate this movie when we rented it from the library, my kid loved it so we had to make sure more kids could rent it.",1503014400,,121,3.5185185185185186
7988527,5,B000092OMA,"My son loves this video.. its short (1/2 hr) but very educational, so we love it. He loves to build things and learn about construction.",1386806400,,136,4.48
7988528,5,B000092OMA,"This is a easy to understand yet detailed video for children.  I must admit that I enjoyed it myself. It gives children the confidence to create a house. More importantly, makes them consider doing household chores, clean the windows, toilet, sink.  It is an amzaing video. I cannot believe how well they did. Great job. Everyone who has or are around children should own this DVD.",1367193600,,381,4.757575757575758
7988529,5,B000092OMA,Our family has enjoyed the dvd.  We have watched it several times.  It was a good purchase for us.  I recommend it to others.,1281139200,,125,4.125
7988530,5,B000092OMA,"My four year old daughter watches this over and over. This video takes you from the architect, to the surveyor, to the finished house. The team narrating is a male and female and they speak to the kids as if they are as intelligent as they really are! This was so informative and interesting. I think it builds critical thinking for kids to see the steps and details of building a structure. I love having a young child who knows how a house is wired for electricity and plumbing, rather than thinking it just magically works. I recommend this highly. The adults might learn something too! I did!",1213488000,2,596,4.527777777777778
7988531,5,B000092OMA,"We are building a house right now, so I thought it would be fun for our kids to have this video. I was right! They LOVE to watch the video, then watch the exact same things going on at our own house. Highly recommended for anyone in the process of building a house!",1200182400,2,265,4.018867924528302
7988532,5,B000092OMA,"My 5 year old son has always loved big trucks and construction machines so I thought we'd get this DVD for his collection. There is so much more to this program than just big trucks! I was surprised at how much I learned about everything that goes into building a house. This is definitely a video for the whole family.  The hosts do a great job of showing ALL the steps that go into building a house in an entertaining way. They never talk down to the audience, but are easy to understand. It's so nice to have a DVD that really explains things and teaches instead of just filling the screen with pictures. My son loves it and so do his friends (and his mommy and daddy like it too....)",1173225600,2,687,4.244274809160306
7988533,5,B000092OMA,"I loved this DVD!  My husband and I watched it first, to make sure it was appropriate for our children (ages 5 and 7).  It was!  Our son and daughter watch it at least 3 times a week and share it with their buddies.  My son is really into tools and dresses up like the workers in the show.  The main characters, Gwen and Danny, talk at a concept level that children can understand, yet it was interesting to me, too.  There is a lot of information packed into a half hour, so children will definitely not be bored.  A winner!",1111881600,7,525,4.138613861386139
