2666795,5,B000J3Q11K,I played this to get myself ready for Christmas next month and fell in love with it!  I will definitely get my money's worth.  The best thing about this disc is that there is an option to play a soundtrack of traditional Christmas songs or Handel's Messiah.  Each song is accompanied by amazing and ultra vivid Christmas stained glass scenes.  I will play this every year.  A+,1194393600,23,376,4.552238805970149
2666796,1,B000J3Q11K,"The SD version looks and sounds fine. However, I've tried two totally different copies of this disc and both of them had unhearable soundtracks on the HD side of the disc. The sound continually sputters throughout the entire  movie. Since I own over 40HD-DVDs and this is the only one that has this problem, I have to assume there is a problem with this particular title. Even with this very serious defect, I've decided to keep the disc and use just the visual portion of it. I can play Christmas CDs at the same time I'm enjoying the beautiful High-Def visuals. I sure hope the company that produces this excellent movie can figure out how to fix this disc.",1181347200,3,659,4.53781512605042
2666797,5,B000J3Q11K,"For someone who enjoys viewing gorgeous video, while listening to lovely renditions of traditional Christmas carols, this disc is a genuine delight.

The video quality is close to perfect--richly saturated colors and razor-sharp closeups of many stained glass windows, as well as some holiday scenery and church exterior views.  Two separate soundtracks are available, and both are first-rate. The music is traditional (no ""Jingle Bells"" or

""Frosty the Snomwman"" type of Christmas music is included).  Using the disc as backgound music during the holiday season is certainly possible, but the quality of the visual images is so high that you really should sit down and devote your complete attention to them.",1179014400,47,709,5.36036036036036

2666800,5,B000J3Q11K,The imagery of stained glass is beautiful.  There is an option to select Christmas carols or portions of Handel's Messiah.  There is just under three hours of music so it does not become repetitious.  Sound and picture are very clear.

2666839,4,B000J3Q11K,This is DVD is a wonderful addition to anyone's Christmas DVD collection. The images are superb and the music beautiful. Some of the stained glass is breathtaking in its beauty. There are interspersed scripture passages that may be problematic for those who simply like the music and art of the building. This is a DVD one can sit down and watch or use as a background for a Christmas gathering. The only drawback is that the names of the cathedrals and their locations are never given making it difficult to learn more about them.,1419638400,,531,4.659574468085107

2666841,4,B000J3Q11K,"This Bluray is exactly what I wanted. This is a ""mood"" disk. Great to have running in background at Christmas party or dinner. Very beautiful footage of various styles of Christian themed stained glass plus churches and winter scenes. The music is fantastic and
are different versions and styles of Christmas songs and music. Most are different than what Christmas music I already have on CD.
The 5.1 mix is excelent on BOTH audio tracks. Giving you about 5 hours of enjoyment if you play the disk twice switching tracks.
This is a religious themed bluray that's all about Christ and the Christmas story. If you are looking for Santa,Elfs,Snowmen and Reindeer.....look somewhere else. I myself love to take photos of stained glass,so for me watching it for pure entertainment was a great time! I watched it TWICE already,not many blurays I can say that about. I'm surprised I got it for UNDER $4.00!!!!!!Best deal of the season for me. If you want to celebrate Christmas at home,this disk shows you spititual scenes and music from all over the world with some Bible verses thrown in for good measure. I'm so glad I found this ""Gem"" and will play it several times every Christmas.",1419033600,,1179,4.784313725490196
2666842,4,B000J3Q11K,"This is easily worth the money; the images are really nice, though -1 star for a noticeable shaky camera on some shots.  It is not all stained glass... there are shot of decorations and nature too. The music is pleasant for the most part with only 2 of the carols that I'll likely skip next time through, It exceeded expectations on that front. The other half with Handel's Messiah will depend on if you like that sort of singing or not. I like some songs from Messiah but others are really hard for me to listen to. This will surely be on the playlist for present opening Christmas morning.",1417996800,,591,4.422018348623853
2666843,5,B000J3Q11K,"I got this because of how inexpensive it is.  It's very well done.  The pictures and music are amazing!  Every now and then some of the pictures, for whatever reason, don't seem to be HD.  They are few and far between and it doesn't take away from it.

2666854,5,B000J3Q11K,"I'm very impressed by the video quality and the pure beauty of the stained glass windows and churches shown throughout the video. The music is a mix between instrumental classic carols and a large traditional church choir singing. As it is all Christian music and not ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" or ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"", I can see myself using this throughout the year and not just at Christmas.",1325030400,3,411,4.802816901408451
2666855,5,B000J3Q11K,"To the previous Reviewer about HD - either your order got mixed up, or it was ordered wrong. This is definitely a Blu-ray!
Want to get totally immersed in this great audio and video Christmas presentation - use the Handel's Messiah as your Audio presentation. Totally involves you with overall effect. Great Video and Audio. Clear and distinct!
Want to pay particular attention to the Stained Glass, or use as a background filler - then use the Christmas carole audio tract.
Great idea of pulling away from the stained glass only, to present interior and exterior views of some of the churches and cathedrals, and some amazing looking Winter scenes!
And at such a low price, over 2 hours of viewing (If you do both audio tracks, which I did), and totally enjoyable. So buy, listen and watch, plus now - relax!",1323993600,4,809,4.704225352112676

2666857,3,B000J3Q11K,"This is a good deal if you don't mind having the HD DVD disc, which is pretty much useless to most people since it won't work on a Blu-Ray player (I tried it).  You still get the standard DVD, which will pretty much play on any machine, and it looks fine.  As far as content goes, these ambient type discs are good for gatherings where people are talking too much to follow a narrative, but it does give them something to look at and talk about.  The music is nice, and you can even turn off your TV and just listen if you want to.  I have to say, I wish one of these companies would put a little more effort into making the video more interesting.  How about a DVD with just images and music that's so interesting you can sit and watch the whole thing by yourself without getting bored?",1295913600,2,787,4.151315789473684

2666860,1,B000J3Q11K,Most disappointing to purchase a Blu-ray DVD of Christmas carols expecting to see a choir singing only to be confronted with slowly changing images of stained glass windows in unidentified churches/cathedrals,1292630400,2,208,5.741935483870968
2666861,5,B000J3Q11K,"I've been burned by a few ""screensaver"" blu rays (the fireplace, aquarium, etc) but not by this one.  The video quality is truly demonstration level 1080p.  It fills the entire screen and is absolutely gorgeous in every sense of the word.  I don't think stained glass could look any better in person.

Additionally the MUSIC is good news!  This really wowed me.  I was expecting the usual awful quality, MIDI child-tinkering tracks, but actually got top notch choir renditions of all the best Christmas songs and hymns.

I was also very happy about the length of the production.  I hate those 30 minute loop BDs that either have to be constantly restarted or start feeling redundant really quick.  Obviously this BD isn't something you really want to sit down and watch the whole way through, but with it being 150 minutes long, if you DID happen to watch it for a few minutes, it's likely you'll experience a fresh, new picture, and not the same one that's been looping for hours.

Overall, take it from me.  I've bought all the snowfalls and the fish tanks and the beach fronts and the fire places, so far this is the ONLY one like them that I'm really satisfied with.  It allows me to show off my HD TV while enchanting guests with it's peaceful, relaxing Christmas atmosphere.  If you'd like a good Blu Ray disc for similar reasons, I can't recommend this one enough.",1290556800,5,1371,4.615702479338843

2666863,5,B000J3Q11K,"If you enjoy this genre - background Christmas music with Hi Def video, then this blu-ray is one for your collection. 'Stained Glass Christmas' has over 3 hours of Christmas music in Dolby 5.1 performed by various European and American choirs, orchestras and soloists (you have a choice of two soundtracks 'traditional Christmas Carols' or highlights from 'Handel's Messiah').  Also featured, are selections from 'The Peace Choir' directed by Royce Devick.

Most of the Church windows featured are from Illinois notably, LaGrange, Oak Park, Downers Grove, Elmhurst, River Forest, Hinsdale and Chicago.  Also featured are a couple of stained glass windows from Germany and Austria - 'The Three Kings Bearing Gifts' by Franz Mayer, Munich Germany and my favorite 'The Stained Heart of Jesus Vision of Saint Sister Margaret Mary' by Tyrol Art Glass Co., Innsbruck Austria.

Many stained glass windows by Tiffany Studios' N.Y. including 'I am the Light of the World', 'Ecclesiastical Angels', 'Rapeleye Memorial' and 'Guiding Angel' are also featured.  These truly exceptional stained glass pieces make this blu-ray a MUST HAVE!

The video quality is exceptional, except for some scenes where the cameras were too quickly zooming in and fading from one scene to another.  I would have liked to see some more lingering shots of the church interiors, but I'm just harping ... this remains one of my favorite Christmas blu-rays!

The bright Louis Comfort Tiffany glass and the John La Farge glass windows with heavenly Christmas music/carols playing in the background will put even Scrooge in the Christmas spirit! :))

My review title describes this blu-ray as having ""a light religious touch"".  I must mention that the video includes a few full frames with Bible verses pertaining to Christmas (eg: Matthew 2:15, Luke 2:8-9).

What a pleasant suprise to hear the great Majestic Christmas music along with beautiful windows out of some of the greatest churches out there. It's great to put on while entertaining as people can still converse and have something heavenly to think about. This is the perfect time of year for this and the second option to have Handels'Messiah, is great. The Blue Ray quality is very good,especially on 1080p tv!!!",1259452800,,488,4.686046511627907

The stained windows themselves and the churches they are in are great, but the production used to show them made me cringe.  Zoom, after zoom with no rhyme or reason. No thought as to pacing of the shots, or length of any of them.

Just when we got in close to a window that really looked interesting, we were whisked away to another, leaving me saying, ""wait, I wanted to look at that!"" Many of the church interiors looked interesting, but we we only caught glimpses of them - not long enough to digest what were were seeing.

Yes, the technical quality was great, and the music fine, but I stopped the video before it was finished. Someday I'll go back and try to get through it all.  So sad...",1236816000,8,759,4.323943661971831

Incredible visuals of stained glass in churches, woven around traditional, warm, visions of homes decorated in beautiful colors that grab at your rememberances of Christmas` past. The sound is clear, clean, and powerful. The song versions hold true to the standards that we all know and love. No modernized, fast and loose with the melody versions that don`t give you that warm,peaceful feeling that this sacred holiday means to so many of us.

We have a 46' LCD 1080 and the blu-ray disk makes everything look so crisp, clear and colorful.  It really filled the home with the TRUE meaning of Chistmas.  My children who are 7 and 4 LOVED it, not to mention the guests. I  highly recommed it. This will now become a family tradition.",1200960000,11,465,4.597560975609756
2666873,2,B000J3Q11K,"The glowing praise in the reviews here at Amazon were what prompted me to purchase this HD-DVD.  Unfortunately, I cannot agree with it.

The majority of the ""scenes"" are simply photos that are panned over, not actually video.  We all could just do a photo slideshow of our own Christmas photos for the same effect, but with more personality.  The small amount of video that is there is shaky and not as sharp as the photos.  Clearly not a professional production.

This could almost be looked over if the scenes were of some gorgeous European cathedrals, but all of the locations are in and around Chicago.  Definitely not what I would consider ""the world's most beautiful stained glass Nativity artwork, holiday scenery and churches"".  If you, like me, were hoping for shots of ancient stained glass, you won't find them here.

My last complaint is with the bible verses displayed between scenes.  I found them very distracting, out of place, overly religious and preachy.  Obviously a work about Christmas and art in churches is inherently religious, but I felt this was a bit over the top in execution.

The music is decent.  Not fantastic, but enough to bring my score to two stars.

I cannot recommend this title.",1198800000,11,1218,4.793269230769231
2666874,5,B000J3Q11K,"We are playing this disc for about 3rd time - Fantastic picture quality - music is very timely for this time of the Year. Hightly Recommended. I'll be buying another copy for my parents.

Merry Christmas.",1197158400,2,204,4.666666666666667
2666875,3,B000J3Q11K,"I've only viewed the HD side of the disc.

Some closeups are finely detailed but overall, it does not have the crispness of, say, Planet Earth. I watched this disc on both a 65"" 1080p dlp rptv and on a 106"" screeen with 720p front projector.

But it is sharper than a typical sd disc and is just as sharp as many hd movies. So a 4 star for video.

It is highly recommended to play as background for a holiday party and the constant changing of images can hold your attention.

Although 5.1 DD, mostly the front 3 channels are used. Not much lower subwoofer output.

Switching between the Christmas Carols and the Messiah, the video is the same for each of them. And if you change the music selection mid disc, it resumes from the exact video point you left with the other audio. But you would be hard pressed to remember all the visiual images if you played each music track in sucession so it can play for several hours.

The audio plays fine through hdmi, 6 channel input or coaxial digital audio cable but will sputter constantly and is unlistenable through Optical digital audio. So just 2-3 stars for audio as many folks only have optical audio connection. And loses stars for not being in Dolby True HD or DTS HD formats.

It's a keeper for background Christmas celebrations or just for a tour of many beautiful pieces of religious stained glass panels.",1196208000,7,1359,4.477732793522267

8149100,3,B000J3Q11K,"Every other reviewer is going to hate me, but I have a few qualms about this video.  The premise is laudable, and the visuals are great; however there is repetition in the windows viewed, and I think maybe the video people could have taken even more stained glass visuals.  There is some attempt to match words in the carols to the visuals : that is good.  My qualms have to do with the music : it is fine, BUT the producers have not credited ANY musician or choir or recording or orchestra or pianist, etc.  Get it?  This is, to them, free music.  They say it is in public domain, that is true as far as the existence of the carols is concerned, (except John Rutter should be warned, his carol is only ten to twenty years old.  )  However, even as at the end of the presentation they credit the churches and stained glass studios which have provided the visual, there is NO mention of who the musicians are, AND they claim that the music is all 5.1 surround sound, making it even more impossible that these recordings could be in public domain.  As a church musician, I am very sensitive to this problem; artists, writers, entertainers get the ""intellectual property"" argument, which is law ; stealers of musical performance should be prosecuted, musicians must pay their bills and eat like anyone else, right? These people do not credit anyone, and, whether they had permission or not (and it seems, NOT), it needs to be acknowledged.  It is unfair to steal a performance which has been put out to entertain and enlighten by any musician(s) and not pay them for use of their talent.  I wish the video producers could see this and rectify this, but it is not likely.  Too bad that they had to be so devious about it.  I would take away the other stars on this issue alone, but, Oh well....",1482796800,,1790,4.45398773006135
