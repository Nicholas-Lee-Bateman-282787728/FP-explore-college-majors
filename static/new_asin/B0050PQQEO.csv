8451610,3,B0050PQQEO,"With all due respect to those that most likely worked on the set and posted the stellar reviews, at best this film is a three-star effort!  Given the marginal acting skills, questionable dialog, and lackadaisical editing, it had the overall look and feel of a Troma production, but without the underlying humor and energetic pace.  Granted, some of the mindless bloodletting sequences are surprisingly well-executed for such a low-budget feature; however, the otherwise slow-moving and somewhat illogical storyline made it hard to stay with the film.  Even the couple of clever twists near the end added more confusion than clarity to the plot.  Expect a few f-bombs, limited nudity and sex, and significant graphic torture and gore; certainly worth a quick viewing, but only if you can find an inexpensive copy!",1381536000,,812,5.175572519083969
8451611,1,B0050PQQEO,"I only wish there was a way to give this zero stars.  The script is wretched but the acting is so atrociously bad that even a brilliant script wouldn't be able to save this.  Horror movies are not know for their acting or script but at least give an effort!!!  At 18 minutes and 51 seconds in I almost turned it off and threw the DVD out.  But I have never given up on a horror movie yet, so I powered through.  I should have gone with my first instinct because this was worse than amateurish. It played out like something created by some freshman in high school film class.  I am at a loss to understand how this movie makes it onto a DVD.  Doesn't anybody screen these things before they invest money into it.  I am just annoyed that I let the reviews, by people who are obviously involved with the film somehow, affect my decision to buy this pile of garbage.  I had an idea that this was going to be the case but I let my eagerness for a new horror movie get the best of me.  So needless to say you should NOT buy this movie.  Don't give these people anymore of our hard earned money than they already have.  You can find my copy in the garbage if you really HAVE to see it...but that would mean investing your time in watching the film.  DON'T DO IT...you will regret it!!!",1319587200,5,1278,4.146341463414634
8451612,3,B0050PQQEO,"This film was ambitious but ends up short of expectations.  This is an ultra low budget slasher so keep that in mind while watching.  There isn't anything in this film that hasn't been done bigger and better by someone else.  I do have to give cool points for some of the kills, torture, and use of blood.  All stereotypical teenagers are represented, and like most horror films in this category, some are annoying more than others and I gladly welcomed their demise.  This is a worthy effort and I look forward to seeing more from the production team to see if they will make em bigger and better.",1314662400,,598,4.5
8451613,5,B0050PQQEO,Wonderful creativity with the blood and gore.  With outstanding acting from Kimberly Magness.  She's going to be big someday!,1310256000,,125,5.526315789473684
8451614,5,B0050PQQEO,"I saw this bloody little flick at the New York City Horror Film Festival.  It played once (I believe) to a completely packed theater with standing room only.  From the first scene all the way to the last, I was amazed with how well it looked and how gory it was.  Interesting story, pretty good actors (with a few stand out actors who blew me away with their performances), lots and lots of gore and torture (and if I remember correctly, some tatas!).  I ordered my copy as soon as I saw it was coming out!",1307318400,3,506,4.239583333333333
8451615,5,B0050PQQEO,"Easily the most brutal, nasty, grindhouse movie I have seen in a long time. It's true 42nd street grindhouse. Not because it's trying hard to be, like so many of these Hollywood movies these days trying to recapture that old look and feel, but because that's exactly what Devil's Grove is. An ultra-low budget, old school gore fest of the first order. Think Bill Lustig's Maniac meets Eli Roth's Hostel with a bit of Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse thrown in.  Now, bump up the violence, sex, torture, blood and body count of all three films. All for a budget of what was most likely the cost of a few lunches on the set of any of the previous mentioned films. (and that's saying something because they were all low budget films for their time) Sure, it's definitely low budget, but what the film lacks in production value and star power, it more than makes up for with the real star of these films...the over the top gory murders! It's so nasty, I honestly kept thinking to myself; Jesus, what the hell are these guys going to do next??!! If you're looking for the next overblown Hollywood vampire film, or one of the mega-budgeted, yet still awful remakes, then avoid this one. But if you're ready for an old school, low budget gore hound flick, then I can definitely recommend Devil's Grove. But be warned, this is NOT for everyone's tastes. Strictly for fans of grue and gore, but if that's your cup of tea...you're going to absolutly love it!",1306368000,10,1442,4.5675675675675675
8451616,4,B0050PQQEO,"Devil's Grove is a low budget film that was co-directed by the founder of the New York City Horror Film Festival. I'll be honest, I wasn't really expecting much but I was very surprised at the overall quality and the level of gore in this film. It's a good little story about some students making a documentary about a local amusement park years after there was a brutal killing there. They soon find out that they should have left it alone! The torture scenes are absolutely brutal and the special effects department must have been working overtime. If you're into films like SAW or HOSTEL, then this is right up your ally. Just make sure you're not having dinner during the last 15 minutes! You have been warned!!!! Enjoy.",1305244800,7,724,4.62015503875969
