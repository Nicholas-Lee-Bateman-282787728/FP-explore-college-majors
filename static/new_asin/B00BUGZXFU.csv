8574061,5,B00BUGZXFU,"I am an avid traveler and was given these dvds for a gift. If you love to travel, especially active, adventure travel (skiing, kayaking, cycling, hiking etc.), then you will love these programs. It's not a historical documentary type program, they are actually traveling, instead of using promotional footage from tourist offices. I felt like I was just tagging along with the hosts on their travels, meeting the locals, tasting the food, kayaking, skiing, etc. It's more like a real travel experience than a TV show. The episodes are all different - some are about a certain ski resort, while others cover a larger area. You will get great ideas for your next trip, and learn a bit about the history and culture of a really diverse set of destinations. I have not found any other travel programs that cover such an interesting array of places, or that are so much fun to watch! If you are itching to see the world, then you'll enjoy these dvd's!",1266451200,,946,4.6706586826347305
8574062,3,B00BUGZXFU,"I just bought this box set. I only watched 6 disks so far. Like I said, so far not to to bad, but and I know there is a lot of skiers out there and this will seem like I'm waw waw. There is way to much skiing parts in the first 6 DVDs. and when the two guides are either hoarse riding or bike riding, they go way to fast. The Idea is to take in the land not race by it and not see everything. If there with a group of people they many times race ahead of them as if to show off. The quality is fair. It also makes it seem like it is all about them (the guides). Better to shop for the (Over DVDs, like over America, California, ect.ect.)and if possible in Blu-ray. I wish there will be more of the Over blu ray dvds. If you by the passport to adventure box set, you may find your self not liking some of the disks. Color not that great, and wish it had some other guides or guide for the whole set. Some one who knows the show is not about them but about the land. Oh well, next time I'll have to do a better web search for more info. on these kind of travel disks. Only buy them if you are a person who travels all the time. Like monthly.",1262217600,5,1139,3.7899159663865545
