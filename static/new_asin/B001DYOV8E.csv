8295483,5,B001DYOV8E,better than I thought it would be. The tutorial is excellent and it's easier to learn by seeing rather than reading a book.,1410048000,,123,4.391304347826087
8295484,5,B001DYOV8E,"I was leary about spending this but money but it was so my daughter and I could make projects together so I did. I'm very pleased. Teaching someone can be stressful, now we can crochet together without frustration.",1369094400,,214,4.657894736842105
8295485,4,B001DYOV8E,"Now I had to buy $75 worth of yarn, but I'll get an afghan out of it.  Seriously. Good product, even for lefties.  My mom learned alot.  Highly recommend.",1346198400,3,154,4.241379310344827
8295486,5,B001DYOV8E,"The dvd was very informative and instructions easy to follow.
The hook in the package was plastic and size was hard to see. It was hard to work with the yarn included.",1298678400,4,167,4.25
8295487,4,B001DYOV8E,"I am a beginner. I was practicing a bit of crochet with a Susan Bates crochet hooks before this item came. The dvd is a great learning tool, but I recommend getting the Susan Bates crochet hook to learn instead of the one that came with this package. I found that the thin 4 mm crochet hook that came with the dvd is too thin for the yarn that came with it. It's either that or the yarn is not that great since practicing on it, the hook would not pick up the yarn accurately - but cuts through the middle of the yarn string itself. I would think that would frustrate a new beginner trying to yarn over and bring to the front a full yarn string, but instead pull only half of it (in the middle of the yarn string). Have fun learning to crochet with this dvd, but I recommend just buying the DVD only that they do sell and get the Susan Bates crochet needle and yarn separately. Remember that certain yarns label certain crochet needle sizes. I looked at the yarn again and it is definitely weak yarn.",1244764800,20,1000,4.186528497409326
