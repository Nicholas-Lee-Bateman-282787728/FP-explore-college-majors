8131360,3,B000GFLKFI,"ALL ABOUT OUR HOUSE / EVERYBODY'S HOUSE (MINNA NO IE).  Poorly Constructed!

Rating = *** (barely)
Director:  Kki Mitani
Producers:  Yumiko Kuga et al.
Streaming
2001

Film = barely three (3) stars; music = four (4) stars; sound = 3.5 stars; cinematography = 2.5 stars.  Director Kki Mitani (who is also credited as the screen writer) starts with what would seem to be an amusing preface filled with comedic possibilities (what may happen when relatives and friends are involved in designing and building an affluent  couple's ""dream house"") and tosses in a clash between Western and traditional Japanese architectural/building philosophies/skills plus some heavy-handed Shinto lampooning.  Unfortunately the result is not especially amusing, overly predicable, and flat-out boring (and much too long). Mitani is unable to engagingly execute his own plotline!  Except for the music (see below), it would appear that the Director's  anemic  film has targeted the wrong audience: the movie would seem to appeal more to viewers of ""free"" TV than paying theater goers.  Acting ranges from amateurish to workman like.  The cast exhibits a serious lack of energy.  Leading actor Naoki Tanaka (who plays the couple's husband) seems miscast (or is unable to fully mask his feeling that the film is a dog?).  Cinematography (wide screen, color) is ""TV quality"" at best with most scenes consisting of medium close-ups and head shots sometimes with unfocused panning and very narrow depth of field (line deliveries can be made by characters in backgrounds who are not in focus!).  Surround-sound field is quite good.  Music is dynamic and covers a wide spectrum from classical-like snippets to modern easy-listening to light jazz.  However, this soporific film can not be rescued (in post production) by simply having lively music on its sound track!  Not especially recommended.

8131361,5,B000GFLKFI,"This is one of those little films that sucks you in and won't let go. Unlike many Hollywood dramas that insist upon your empathy and tug at your heartstrings relentlessly, this charming Japanese comedy/drama (dramady) waits for you politely as you finish each bite of the story. Some people have a hard time with Japanese humor, but if you allow your brain to switch gears, there are some profoundly funny moments here. It is touching in many ways, refreshing, and thought provoking. Five stars, because for what it is I certainly can't find fault.",1446940800,,548,4.840425531914893
8131362,5,B000GFLKFI,"Awesome drama/comedy movie!  Heart warming!  If somebody love Japanese stuff, this you can give to them.  I wish they sell as blue-ray.",1385078400,,135,5.045454545454546
8131363,4,B000GFLKFI,"This charming, lightweight story follows the adventures of a young Japanese professional couple as they set out to build a new home. Naosuke is a television script writer. He and Tamiko, his wife, have purchased a plot of land where they intend to have a house built.

They decide to hire Eiji Yanagisawa, a college friend of Tamiko's and now an interior designer specializing in furniture, to design the structure. Though he has no experience as an architect, Yanagisawa has strong aesthetic opinions. His taste runs to modernism and western influences.

 To oversee the actual construction, they call on Tamiko's father, who is a retired building contractor from the older generation, a man with conservative traditional tastes.

Conflict begins when the couple want to leave out the washitsu (Japanese style tatami room). ""When you get older you'll wish you  had it,"" Tamiko's father  insists. It is soon evident that this is a generation gap with a Japanese twist.

Much of the film is devoted to the power struggle that develops between Yanagisawa and Tamiko's father. The clash of egos is resolved when a crisis involving damage to an antique piece of furniture belonging to one of Yanagisawa's clients requires both men to contribute their skills and knowledge to repair the damage, working under deadline pressure.

Beneath the story, then, lies a parable about cooperation, and the need to put aside our differences and work together to achieve a higher goal.

Don't look for profound lessons here, but those for whom the subject matter has some appeal are likely to find this light, amusing fare entertaining.",1308873600,,1619,5.079245283018868
