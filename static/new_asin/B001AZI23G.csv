3476898,5,B001AZI23G,"Core fusion is a great method and the best way to get into shape. This DVD takes everything from core fusion and adds even more body busting with pilates. The teaching is informative so you always know what to do and it almost comes easy, yet the workout is super intense. If you can't get to an exhalespa this is the way to go",1232928000,3,327,4.125

When given the go ahead by my doctor to move again, I found the Core Fusion Pilates DVD, and the Core Fusion Body Sculpt DVD, to be the only workouts that I could do without increasing my injury. In fact, it helped do the exact opposite and helped HEAL my back. After 6 weeks, I went from having a severe condition to being clean and clear. I did not take any drugs. I went to the chiropractor regularly, iced my injury, and did Core Fusion, and I feel better than ever!!! Not to mention I lost inches from my waist and hips, and am the strongest, leanest, and most flexible I have ever been! This dvd is AWESOME and empowering!",1229817600,117,680,4.198473282442748
3476903,3,B001AZI23G,"This DVD is not a favorite of mine either , although it is produced and instructed very well , people should know there is no pilates in this DVD , there are only 2 pilates inspired exercises during the whole workout : a modified hundred and a roll up (if you don't count pushups), the rest of this DVD is all lotte berk inspired exercises. My favorite segments are Upper body & Upper body challenge which is a 5 minute bonus, both consist of pushups , planks and side planks which I love , and stretches. I also think this is a pretty boring workout mainly because of the small movement lotte berk style exercises and the fact that half of every segments is basically stretching , also every segment starts with a lotte berk warm up which gets really annoying when you do all of the segments together ,  their second DVD (Body Sculpt) is better and a bit more challenging and there is a warm up only in the first segment. If you like lotte berk then you will probably like it but if you like pilates , you won't necessarily .",1228348800,17,1026,4.288659793814433

I absolutely love this program. I am a Pilates lover and although this is not a typical Pilates routine - the practice is based on Pilates principles - it's great to throw in, tone and sculpt, and mix things up. The instructors are easy to follow and explain each move thoroughly. It's no wonder this spa is so popular with the stars - I can feel a burn instantly. I highly recommend this program for any Pilates lover looking to mix up their practice and try something new.",1228176000,41,655,5.822916666666667
3476905,3,B001AZI23G,"I just finished reviewing this dvd and I had to really think about whether or not I wanted to keep it.  You see, I'm a dance/yoga person.  I like creative movement with music and I like to enjoy myself while I exercise; and although this is a challenging dvd, I couldn't see myself doing it on a regular basis and enjoying it.  That said, here is what you can expect.

Class takes place in a very nice spa-like room with 2 teachers.  You can see a video clip on youtube.  The instruction is in voice over and this is what annoyed me the most:  the cuing AND music did not match the movement.  You really have to be motivated to keep up as there is no to very little counting.  The voice over is not taught like a class.  It had the feel of a demonstration.

There are 5 sections, 10 minutes each.  Each section except the last starts with knee lifts.  I was annoyed that the movement didn't match the music.  I would have rather had no music than to have off beat movement.
The first section is upper body strength using forearm plank and pushups,and tricep dips.  The next section is thighs and glutes.  You can see this section on youtube.  The third section is pure ab work and it looks very hard.  I believe the fourth section is work at the wall.  This is the best section IMO.  If I were to keep this dvd, this is the section that I would do the most.  You sit against the wall and do leg raises, leg lifts, pike position, etc.

After some thought I decided to send the dvd back. I was bored watching it.  I guess I am not a pilates person and I didn't like the way the material was presented.  As always with Acacia there is a music only option.  If you like pilates, then this dvd is for you.  If you are highly motivated and can count on your own, then this dvd is for you.  As for me.  I'm going to pass on it",1228089600,53,1819,4.105413105413105

I also don't like that they don't mention in the beginning of the segment that you need an open wall space.

3476943,5,B001AZI23G,"Great workout plan. Pilates are fab. Difficult but slow moving so as not to injure yourself. My 13 year old son and I love these workouts. Truly. They work our bodies and we feel it after, and the next day...it's challenging but not over the top and harmful. Which is why I wanted to try Pilates. I have a metal hip (partially) and other injuries from that accident. I wanted a good workout and not stressing my back or joints etc. This is the perfect solution for folks like me that need lower impact and slower paced programs. But still very effective. And they are clear and precise with the instructions too, which is vital. There is always a modifier, so there is one more difficult, and one less difficult person to see/follow, for every movement. And they are always on screen and visible and there are always verbal directions too.  This is important for beginners and non Pilates experts...I've done other workouts where the modifier isn't always visible and instruction isn't always given on your options...these caused me to be unable to keep up and ultimately look for a different program. This Pilates series gives clear and thorough instruction all the way through. I'm so glad. Give it a try if you're considering a new low impact program or trying Pilates...this is a great addition to your work out library!",1455235200,3,1324,4.731601731601732

3476956,5,B001AZI23G,Great intro to Pilates style workouts with lots of variation for different levels of fitness so it will continue to grow with you as your strength improves. It's more barre core work than Pilates with lots of curve and and hold -- the core section is very challenging! I like the brief warm up at the beginning of each section in case you only want to do one short segment a day or string it with something else. The voiceover is great and I really appreciate the thoughtful cuing as its very important to perform these exercise with proper form and alignment. Nice to have in my extensive collection.,1445731200,3,601,4.522935779816514

3476960,5,B001AZI23G,This DVD pushed me when I thought my body was getting used to the Body Scuplt DVD.  My stomach got really flat using this DVD.  I like this version of Pilates better than some of the other DVDs out there.  I found my body responds better using Core Fusion than any other DVD.,1438214400,,275,4.150943396226415
3476961,4,B001AZI23G,Really intense workout especially for the core as advertised. I've been doing pilates for years and my abs were screaming after this workout and sore (in a good way) for 2-3 days afterward. I wasn't sure I was really working any other parts of the body besides core but my muscles in arms and legs were sore the next morning so I definitely was. I like that the DVD is split into five 10-min segments so you can mix and match or split up workouts depending on time. One thing I didn't like was that the instruction is a voice-over. The two instructors are doing the workout with cheesy smiles and no talking while the voice over plays. It's just really weird and not like most other fitness DVDs. That being said the instruction and cues were good and detailed. They also showed modifications for different fitness levels.,1431302400,,822,4.5608108108108105
3476962,5,B001AZI23G,"This is my go-to workout DVD for a quick strength training session. It is low impact but still intense, which is great for me because I have had a lot of lower back issues. I like the soothing, peaceful vibe of the workouts. I'm not one for Jillian Micheals and other ""yelly"" type instructors. But if you are into that sort of thing, this DVD will probably seem boring as Fred and Liz are calm and cool throughout the DVD. But just because there isn't a bunch of sweaty people in the background getting yelled-at doesn't mean this isn't a good workout. I would highly recommend the Core Fusion DVD's for people that enjoy a more laid back approach to fitness.",1430956800,,659,4.454545454545454

3476965,4,B001AZI23G,"Great ""core"" video! The results from even a handful of sessions shows but I don't find myself so sore that I can't move the next day (which of course as I get older is a big bonus).  It is a little blas in terms of music and script but hey not all yoga couples are going to be a barrel of laughs!  I also think that it is true that this video effectively strengthens backs while supporting them throughout the workout.  I had some pretty serious back spasms which I was prescribed painkillers for and I was glad that this video offered a more holistic form of treatment.  I haven't had even one spasm since starting this video about three times a week and I have even cut down on the advil/tylenol for minor aches.  Overall I would highly recommend this video for a beginner or someone who is perhaps looking for a low intensity workout while recovering from an injury.",1424131200,,869,4.372670807453416

3476988,1,B001AZI23G,"I got this from the library & I was surprised when I saw the first exercise! I guess these people don't believe in warming up BEFORE you begin exercising because I can't see myself just jumping right into any exercise before warming up. Well not this DVD! First off, it's narrated all the way through. Second, when I clicked on a few routines, (except the core), the two people in the video were swinging their arms rapidly while moving their legs like they were in a marching band. Bands or a towel was used a little later, your choice. But why when it came to the core routine they didn't use a mat? They were just laying on the floor, the hard floor, com' on!  Before you buy something you don't like, the library is a good resource!

One thing I liked was that I can do this later at night without getting very revved up and then being unable to sleep. It's actually pretty relaxing. If you have lower back problems you may just have to modify some of their moves. Their ""straight leg out"" moves where you sit straight up with your legs out and you cross them as you hold your legs up in the air...that's something I do at my own modified way otherwise it cramps my back. if you have knee problems then the stretches that you do with your knees down on the ground...make sure your knees stay ALL the way down and be sure you don't go back too far. These people are in spectacular shape so don't feel pressured. I did think the voice-overs rather than the live instruction during the work out were a bit odd but I got used to it. It is a nice non-impact type workout that still makes you feel that you put in a good work out. Sorry, not a great detailed review. I would definitely say try it out and add it in your mix. It has some surprisingly good upper body/arm work. The odd thing about this was I thought I would be really sore after doing it for the first time and I wasn't.

My only complaints involve the music and the creepy smiling. First, there is the option for music or music with instruction but no simple instructions. The music is kinda annoying and I wish there was the option for just instructions as I don't like looking at the TV while trying to go through the routines.

I am fairly new to pilates, but I have spent most of my life dancing, gymnastics, working out so I'm definitely not new to the ways of working out.  I like to learn new things & new workouts and I have heard many positives about pilates so I said, what the heck, I'll try it out.  This is my 3rd pilates dvd and I love it.  I got thru most of the dvd without dying or losing pace.  I did sweat and got my heart rate up which was good.  The instructors explained everything and were pleasant and background music was very light.  I hate strong, overpowering music with pilates... I'll keep that for kickboxing or running! lol!

It's really a great workout and hits all the strategic body parts.

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that I am a 61 year old, though pretty fit, going to the gym five days a week, cardio and weight training. I don't want to give anyone the impression that you won't get a terrific workout just because someone my age can do it. But I also want to encourage people not to think they shouldn't try it just because they are ""more mature.""

I love the way, as in their Body Sculpt DVD, they have the workout divided into segments with stretching after each one. The final segment is all stretching. I have never really enjoyed stretching. It was always something that I did just to avoid injury. However, doing these Core Fusion DVDs, I have developed a love for stretching.

I really appreciate the cues that are repeated throughout the workout. Perhaps to some it does sound robotic as one reviewer said but for me the reminders are necessary.  Having been a personal trainer for many years, I know that it was necessary to provide repetitive cues to my clients as well.

I have every single Core Fusion DVD, and I love them all, although they are each a little different.  Body Sculpt and Long and Lean are both full body workouts, the latter a little more challenging than the former.  Both Arms and Abs and Thighs and Glutes are self-explanatory.  Pilates Plus focuses on abs/core work.  And the yoga Energy Flow and the Bootcamp DVDs are cardio workouts, the latter more challenging than the former, although both are quite rigorous and will make you sweat buckets.  I have taken both Pilates Mat and Pilates Fusion classes for a few years, and these DVDs are a wonderful complement when I am not in class, and in my opinion, are sometimes even more challenging than what I get in my exercise classes.  I have tried a number of different exercise DVDs over the years, and these are the only ones I have ever stuck with.  They are very enjoyable, challenging (but not so challenging that you give up), invigorating, interesting (they do not get boring because there is so much variety built in), and I have noticed some subtle differences in my body from my work with both the DVDs and my classes.  To really burn fat, though, you have to alter your diet. These DVDs will help with sculpting muscle (like a ballet dancer's body), but not so much with fat loss (at least I have always found that my weight loss occurs with diet and not with exercise, but that's just me.)

3477068,5,B001AZI23G,"The Exhale Core Fusion dvd series are some of the best workout dvds I've found and this is no exception. Be warned that there are no traditional pilates exercises here, but it is a solid mix of strengthening and flexibility enhancing (challenging!) exercises. There are 5 10 minute chapters (and 2 bonuses from their other dvds). The 5 main workouts include:

Upper Body Core: lots of planks, push ups, and reverse pushups. I find this pretty challenging, even doing modifications, but my upper body is fairly weak.

Thigh & Gluteus Core: Starts with variations on kneeling & leaning back which really gets your quads working. There's also different leg lifts when on hands/knees. Some additional stretches like spinal twists, cat/cow, etc. Challenging but do-able.

Flat Back/Round Back Core: This is one of the more unique sections. You sit with your legs out (either straight or bent, it switches) and do variations of lifting the legs and opening and closing them. Towards the end your legs are up at a higher angle, almost in a pike position (leaning against a wall for stability). Works all parts of your thighs, glutes and abs.

Pure Core: Also unique. It's all abs here but you're not doing 800 crunches. You basically hold one crunch the entire time, moving your arms in different ways and twisting your body. This section is impossible. I last only a minute or two before I have to modify their modifications and I consider my core fairly strong. If you get through this without any modification you are a master. I love it though, it gives me something to work toward.

Core Flexibility: A mix of resting, leg stretches, and back/ab stretches such as twists and a bridge.

My only complaint with the dvd is that every segment begins with the same warmup (knee lift marches) which can get boring and repetitive quickly if you're doing all 50 minutes at once. A minor gripe though for what is really an excellent workout. This series is the only one I've found where I can honestly say one 10 minute segment still feels like a great workout, because of how intense it is.

Within 5 minutes it reminds me of being in school where they suck the life out of you, or any idea of creativity, fun & enjoyment. The voices of Fred & Elizabeth are so devoid of emotion, they are robotic. Everything is said carefully & with the intention of only burning calories or strengthening muscles, there's no body awareness intention. Fred always has an uncomfortable or pained look & Elizabeth has also an uncomfortable fake smile most times.
The production qualities are top notch, the expensive spa theme is beautiful, but too relaxing, it cemented with the voices of me wanting to sleep rather then move & the music is so bland I don't even notice it. Having Fred show the moderate to hard levels of the exercises while Elizabeth did the more modified versions was great.

Workout Chapters:
Upper Body Core - push ups, forearm planks, etc.
Thigh & Gluteus Core - kneeling & leaning back with different arm movements, camel, cat/cow, hands/knees w/leg lifts, seated spinal twist
Flat Back/Round Back Core - sitting & just lifting the legs straight or bent at different angles/degrees to work the abs & different parts of the gluts/thighs are great & more challenging then they look (really works great, good for while watching tv or on the phone!).
Pure Core - crunches, holding crunches w/leg lifted static (really works great, good for while watching tv or on the phone!).
Core Flexibility - resting at first, then yoga bridge, stright leg to face stretch, reclined yoga twists, etc.
Bonus:
Upper Body Challenge (5 min) - more plank & push ups, side plank & yoga star pose
Exhale: Core Fusion Body Sculpt  - Thigh Sculpt section

The exercises themselves? Besides the robotic arm swing/knee lifts at the start of every section except the flexibility one to increase body temp & blood movement (wow, doesn't that sound FUN & motivating!?!??) are very good & challenging, but done on many other toning dvds.

I know many will disagree who love these dvds that the voice is soothing, etc., but please, it's just an opinon & there is room in life for a difference of opinion as long as it's respectful. I know many will get the benefits of this series & that's why I give it 3 stars, it is an effective workout. If there were 10 stars, I'd give it a 6-7.

It offers a wide range of exercises and stretches that are broken down into short workouts, or one workout that lasts about an hour. I choose to do the whole thing and never experience pain the following day.

 Every exercise has a counter stretch that un-does any tightness, soreness, or discomfort you might feel the next day. It also prevents bulking, instead giving a lean, toned look. I was also amazed at the speed of my progress.  Within two weeks I noticed definate improvement in my strength and flexibility (and a change in my body shape).

For reference, I am doing the P90X ""Ab Ripper"" twice a week and still found the core work in this to be really tough.

Overall, I think it is a pretty good set-up - the filming & instruction is very easy to follow & pleasing to watch. The two instructors show modifications for both strength & flexibility, which was helpful.

My main disappointment with this DVD is that I had really hoped it would be more challenging. The 10 minute segments end up being too short for me, especially because the actual ""workout"" is very short & they spend a lot more time stretching at the end of each segment. I think it would be a lot better if there were more repetitions and a few more moves in each segment. There are five 10 minute segments, so you can mix them together - but even after the 50 minutes, I mostly just felt loosened up/well-stretched, when what I was really wishing for was to feel a bit fatigued/sore.

I would say this is a great DVD for beginners who don't have a lot of time or to add on to the end of a more complete workout for some stretching.",1275696000,,1020,4.27979274611399

My guy friend did this with me thinking it was going to be extremely easy. Hah! He couldn't even make it through the upper body & core set that was full of planks. The thighs and glutes were intense as always, and I love the burn.

Core fusion's ""strength within stillness"" kills me, it hurts so good! After doing this DVD my abs felt tight all day long, which is great because I know it's working. This is another fabulous workout by core fusion!",1270684800,6,590,4.363636363636363

I am a 5 foot tall female who weighs 150 pounds and although I am told by my doctor that I am healthy I don't feel it. After doing the first two workouts on this DVD (upper body core and thigh and glut core) I am absolutely exhausted. I know that as the day progresses I will be feeling it more and more. I think that between the 4 DVDs they currently have out plus the one that is coming out in May I will try to do at least 2 sections a day to keep in the variety of a workout without getting bored.

3. Because each exercise sequence is timed properly, not just random, like other DVDs, ie some workout DVDs have you doing 2 minutes on one side and only one on the other.
4. Not wasting time with explanating the obvious.
5. For the mixture of muscle, aerobic and stretching intermittantly throughout the workout so that once you get really tired from the muscle part, a short stretching session follows

Only a small section of it is similar traditional mat pilates, which is not what I was expecting (and perhaps that's why I was so displeased).

Otherwise, you can challenge yourself with each segment, and you will feel the results immediately. I feel great after this workout because I know it is making a real difference. It's amazing that such little movements can be so challenging! And the segment length is not too long so it is easier to push yourself harder.

Anyone have any recommendations for other workouts that would go along well with this one?",1259712000,4,619,4.618181818181818
3477098,5,B001AZI23G,"Due to knee problems, I have not tried the thighs and glutes routine, but I have really enjoyed the routines I have used:

Upper Body Core: This is a series of plank variations (forearm, full, pushup) and tricep dips followed by stretching.  About half of it is stretching, but I didn't have a problem with that.

Flat Back/Rounded Back: I had initially not used this routine, but was intrigued when I had seen comments on another site about how difficult this routine is to do correctly (e.g. feeling it more in the lower back or hip flexor instead of isolating the lower abs).  So, I had to try it.  I'm not sure if I would have done the routine correctly when I first started to use the DVD, but I really like this now.  It is a great workout for the lower abs!! If your abs are not very strong yet, you may wish to skip the portions where your back is flat against the wall, and work into it.

Pure Core:  I LOVE this segment.  I was doing my own ab routines and was very bored with them. So, I've added this routine in three days a week.  It is a lot more intense than basic crunches and I have noticed that my abs have tightened and become a lot stronger.  I have posterior innominate rotation on my left and have found that this routine combined with other exercises I do has really helped stablize my Core. I also really like the challenge this segment provides - as you become more advanced you can rely less on keeping your hands on your thighs for support. This is my favorite segment.

Stretch Core:  I also really, really like this segment.  The stretch segment focuses mostly on the lower back, with some stretching of the hamstring and inner thigh.  I have a combination of lower back and hip problems, and have found this stretching routine to be very helpful.  This does not replace my basic lower body stretching routine that I do each day as it doesn't target everything, but if you have lower back problems I think this could be very helpful. I have been doing this stretch routine 3-4 days a week.

Update for Thighs & Glutes:  I waited several weeks after getting out of PT for my knee and began to use the barre style thigh routines.  They have helped my knee a lot. I was worried about them at first, but making sure I follow their instructions on form it has helped with my quadriceps and inner thighs.",1259366400,10,2327,4.357308584686775
3477099,5,B001AZI23G,"I was surprised at how much I've enjoyed this video.  I do 1-2 segments weekly tacked onto other exercise, so it's really easy to fit into my routine and I've found these to be quite intense bursts.  I'm sure the whole video done at once would feel energizing from head to toe.

I've been doing pilates for 10 years and no longer have time to attend classes.  I'm sure the Exhale classes are great in person, but I don't have much time or the $35 per class to go to them!  I've done a few barre videos in my day, many are forgettable.  I just can't get into Callanetics or Lotte Berk, the videos I've done for them I've dubbed ""body-perfecting barre-torture DVDs"" full of weird thrusting and repetition.  Not so with this DVD!

The instruction is in clear voice over.  The instructors, who I found out are married but the chemistry is very low-key, are attractive without being intimidating and they even keep their abs covered so I'm not sad I'll never look like that and can focus on the strengthening benefits I'm getting.  Most importantly, they have very grounding voices and guidance.

The segments are divided by what part of the body is being worked.  The one focused on pure core was brutal in a good way, and I found the glutes one remarkable as I felt muscles I didn't know I had working.  The moves seem to have a deep impact!  They balance each section with a walking-in-place warmup and a stretch, and the final stretch is very relaxing.

This is, bottom-line, user-friendly.  This relaxed approach is not passive, there's intensity.  Overall, it's very balanced.",1250553600,39,1577,4.615107913669065

By the next morning my abs were really sore--but that is with any new workout, but overtime it becomes easier.

It is broken up into 10 minute segments, targeting different body parts, so you can do as much or as little as you please.
Each 10 minute segment gives a great workout for that body part.
It can be modified easily if you're just starting out. It's also great if you're sick of doing crunches and squats. The thigh exercises are lengthening and work your smallest muscles for toning and shaping.
The ""pure core"" section is my favorite, and I have a very weak core. I made it through feeling challenged (resting a couple times) but not overwhelmed. Also, after a few sessions, I walked around with a very different, pulled-in feeling deep in my abs and back. I see a noticeable difference when I am running too and catch my profile in reflection. It's so much flatter and pulled in, like it should be! I was impressed. I hate ab work in general but don't mind this at all!!
