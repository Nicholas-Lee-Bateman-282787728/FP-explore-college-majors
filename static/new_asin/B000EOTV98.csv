2525552,5,B000EOTV98,"This show wasn't even given a chance, Stuart Townsend and the rest of the cast were fantastic.  The show had a very hip vibe, very smart writing.  ABC was stupid enough to put the show on a night that many were watching something else.  Along with ""Miracles""(Skeet Ulrich) another great show that was lost to the shuffle, this needs to be look upon again!",1141689600,19,355,4.515625
2525553,3,B000EOTV98,"Grissom from ""CSI"" needs to be called in on this unusual homicide. It seems that a network ABC mysteriously killed a show that they wanted. It appears that they just pushed it in front of the runaway hit ""CSI"" but there could be much more to the murder than meets the eye. Remaking a classic whether it be good or bad is always tricky business because you risk alienating the original fans and can be unable to pull in a new audience. ""Battlestar: Galatica"" is a rare success in the area ""reimagining"" the concept for a more sophisticated audience. That show has polarized fans of the original they either love it or hate it but producer/writer Ron D. Moore shaped a new series from older material that captured a solid audience because of its intelligent scripts and well written drama. Frank Spotnitz a producer/writer on ""The X-Files"" and ""Millennium"" takes the inspiration for those shows ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" TV movies as well as the humor laced camp classic TV show that followed and unsuccessfully updated it for today's audience by imitating the shows they inspired. While the show failed to live up to its potential it improved by leaps and bounds over time and showed potential after emerging from the shadow of its inspiration. It's possible the show may never of had much of an audience as Spotnitz alienated core fans of the original cheesy but fun TV series (these same people probably never realized that ""The Night Stalker"" began life as a serious modern day horror movie with humor vs. a humorous show with horror). For what it's worth ""The X-Files"" took much of the first year to find its groove and I believe that ""Night Stalker"" would have improved. After the promising pilot episode the show took a downward turn but began to improve again just as ABC pulled the plug. While actor Stuart Townsend can't hold a candle to Darren McGavin's charismatic performance in the original TV movies and the TV series (one of its saving graces) he does a credible job as does most of the cast.

As befits a new TV series ""Night Stalker"" looks quite good in this transfer. The gritty, detailed images from the TV show have never looked so good. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround audio sounds nice with the dialogue and music coming through with crystal clarity. My only reservation is that the entire series run of ten episodes plus the extras and commentary tracks have been packed on two single sided dual layered discs. The Show looks extremely good even with 5 episodes packed onto each of the two discs and with commentary tracks, deleted scenes and a featurette ""A Conversation with Frank Spotnitz"" included on the set.

""Night Stalker"" only lasted 6 episodes. The extras here are pretty good considering the short run of the show.  We do get an intelligent commentary track from writer/producer Frank Spotnitz, Daniel Sackheim and Michelle Maxwell MacLaren on the pilot discussing both the triumphs and failings of his new series as well as how he would have resolved the story arc that was designed to last at least a season regarding the murder of Kolchak's wife Irene. We also get a second commentary track with Spotnitz and Sackheim joined by co-producer John Kousakis  ""The Sea"" the second on a two part episode (the second episode didn't air on network TV but did air on the Sci-Fi Channel).  Spotnitz provided commentaries for some of ""The X-Files"" episodes he wrote so he's a pro here providing a wealth of information about the creation of the show and its brief development. Spotnitz and his co-producer also appear on ""The Sea-Part 2"" providing information about that episode.

You can also print two scripts commissioned for the show but that weren't produced due to the cancellation of the show via the Interactual player. The Interactual software is included on the second disc. The first is ""Ascendant written by Melissa Blake & Joy Beth Blake and the second written by Emmy Award winner Darin Morgan (""The X-Files"" episodes ""Jose Chung's `From Outer Space'"" and ""The Final Repose of Clyde Bruckman"" among many others). While it's not the same as having the final two episodes produced, it does allow fans of the series to continue to delve into the Kolchak's world.

""A Conversation with Frank Spotnitz"" provides the background on the creation of the series and Spotnitz's approach with the material. While a big fan of the original TV movies and the TV shows Spotnitz also recognized that the original series could never work today. In tone the show is closer to the original TV movies and ""Millennium"" as well as ""The X-Files"". Spotnitz also discusses the reasons for the change in location for the series as well his choice to use high definition video cameras to shoot the show vs. film. Spotnitz discusses the resolution of the show much more in the commentary tracks but he also points out that although Kolchak didn't kill his wife he was born evil which makes him the perfect anti-hero for the story. At the conclusion of the interview we get a brief snippet of an outtake.  We get deleted scenes for three episodes ""The Pilot"", ""Three"" and ""Into the Night"".

While ""Night Stalker"" didn't get the love it deserved and went passed into the world of cancelled shows that just didn't get a chance, we can still enjoy it on DVD. Touchstone has done a marvelous job of presenting the show including commentary tracks, a featurette, two scripts in DVD-ROM format that can be printed out and deleted scenes.",1141430400,67,5460,4.793836344314559

EXACTLY.

This is not, never was, & never will be KOLCHAK!  It was nothing but an X-Files LITE with stolen name from a beloved series that is still cherished all these years later - a series I watched personally when it was originally broadcast in the 1970s!

2525579,1,B000EOTV98,"As a fan of the original series, I was interested in the re-imagined version. I grew up watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker, and came back to it over the years. But this is nothing like it. The original had several elements that are missing here: wit, character, and the jarring juxtaposition of humor and horror. Lacking those elements, the new version offers a bland character, a tacked-on back story, and fashionable bleakness that worked on the '90s for shows like Millennium. Kolchak was fun. Night Stalker isn't. Nor is it sophisticated. Nor does it keep your attention. Nor does it boast eccentric characters played by top character actors. It just seems soulless and dreadful. Lacking so much of what made the original a classic, it just falls flat. It's easy to see why it didn't last. Thankfully, the old series is being reissued soon at an affordable price.

Something was off and it just seemed to be missing that special element that good shows have. But then I binged watched it a second time, and it was starting to grow on me. After I watched the series again and got to know all of the characters and the back story really well, I saw the potential that the show had to offer. The only character that I really had a problem with was Perry (Gabrielle Union); they made her a little annoying. I have not seen the original series, so I am not sure if that is just how her character is supposed to be played. I think Stuart Townsend did a decent job playing the main character of Carl Kolchak, and the rest of the supporting cast was good also. The series only had 10 episodes, so it leaves off with a lot of unanswered questions.

2525608,2,B000EOTV98,"You know, this series had potential, but their biggest, most fatal flaw was associating it what the iconic Kolshack the Night Stalker series.  This is an X-Files re-hash.  The original series - it's poor special effects aside - had so much going for it, and this does not trap that lightning and place it in a new bottle.  Darrin McGavin's crafting of his character (which he never liked, by the way) was so good that its memory lasted for years (remember, aside from Ralphie, it was the Old Man who made A Christmas Story the classic it is).  Ripping the name off of that character and slapping it on another actor, whose character is in a completely different profession, just seem so out of place that you really can't watch this series without that getting in the way.

Your best bet is to pick up the old series, deal with the 70's TV special effects, pick up the two movies as opposed to this.  And for additional flavor, pick up The Norliss Tapes, which was the pre-cursor for the Kolschack character (and a very creepy movie, by the way).",1426982400,2,1046,4.507936507936508

2525610,2,B000EOTV98,"This is a darker version of the original series, and this Carl Kolchak has little in common with the first Night Stalker.  The original Carl Kolchak was energetic and clever.  This version of the character is very mellow and laid-back.  He also lacks the original Kolchak's ability to quickly spot the supernatural from the natural.

The original series was a classic, and it possessed a certain spark that is not found in this pale copy.  Maybe it was Kolchak's whistle at the beginning of each episode.  Or it could be how the first Night Stalker narrated the opening scenes.  But this series does not have ""it.""

The main character of this series, Carl Kolchak, lives in a luxury apartment and he has a pool in his apartment.  He was once a world class journalist who has obviously amassed some level of wealth.  This is in direct contrast to the original character who wore the same suite throughout the entire series.  And this Carl Kolchak works for a very affluent news service.  The original Night Stalker worked for a news agency that was one step up from a tabloid.

The original Night Stalker investigated cases, and he fought against evil.  But he was not really connected with his cases.  This Carl Kolchak seems to have a personal interest in his investigations.  In the pilot episode, he is basically investigating a case that may have been connected to the death of his wife.

It is sad that this remake does not even stand on its own.  It is presented like a cheap version of the X-Files.",1423872000,22,1505,4.636363636363637

He seems to have insight that others do not and the courage or stupidity to go after all sorts of monsters in order to find out the truth about what happened to his wife years earlier.

Save the X-Files of course.  I remember thinking the same thing about the similiarly short lived show on ABC entitled Mircales.  And wouldn't you know it, both shows got cut at about the 6th episode.  (Anyone hear the twilight zone music playing in the background?)  The writers and producers do a great job of shining a black light on a crime and revealing it to be much more than what was readily apparent.  Perri and Jain were my favorite actors in the show.  I love Gabrielle's ability to deliver quick, wit filled dialogue.  (She would have been soooo great as a regular on West Wing).  And while Stuart Townsend was perfect in that he looked every bit the part of the typical guy next door who worked as an eager beaver journalist by day and mourned the loss of his wife, his dark, brooding persona definitely gave one the impression that he very easily could have been the one that killed her.  That being said this series was not perfect.  For instance, the pilot episode could have ended much better.  Also the way the episodes were arranged could have been more effective.  The episode ""5 People You Meet In Hell,"" which I think is one of the best ones, should have been placed closer to the end when they could have more readily explained why that psycho, Damon, was able to ""persuade"" Kolchak to kill Perri.

I really wish that they had been allowed to continue the series.

""The Night Stalker"" is one such series. Unfortunately, it is not one of the better ones. ""The Night Stalker"" was cancelled after six episodes (ten were made and all are included in this 2-disc set) and rightly so. The scripts are full of holes, the acting is mediocre and none of the main characters are remotely interesting.

The story revolves around Carl Kolchak (Stuart Townsend), a journalist whose wife was murdered by some sort of monster and Kolchak is now out to discover exactly what happened (and in the process, discovers the truth about a lot of other strange events). This is a remake of a 1970's TV series (""The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler"" and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker""), which admittedly didn't run for much longer than this series (only 2 tele-movies and 20 episodes), but which is far superior to this show.

Even at his most morose, Duchovny's character was able to lob a couple of fast ones at Scully which would be received with her standard deadpan scowl. The original Kolchak did not take itself too seriously and Spotnitz and crew could learn a lesson or two from that. All things considered, there were a handful of fine episodes in it's short run. Unfortunately, while Townsend and Union are photogenic they both lack the nuances of a great character actor like McGavin. It probably isn't fair to examine either of the two series through the prism of thirty years of change but the original series has a charm all its own which will not be easily emulated by modern refashioning and atmospheric camera work.

The original series with Darin McGavin had some color - Kolchak was a quirky and interesting character reminiscent of Peter Falk in the Columbo series - this 'modern day' Kolchak looks and acts more like Donny Osmond and his pairing with the skeptic Perri Reed only reinforces this image - she looks like someone who wandered onto the wrong set - she should have been on the 'Saved by the Bell' rerun set. She can't act, she's not the least bit credible, and she's just plain bad. This loser features laughable story lines - nothing ever gets grisly or terrifying - nothing ever gets even suspenseful.

Overall, the problems with the Night Stalker has to do with its untimely demise.  The show didn't have time to resolve anything with the main theme.  Another thing is that it doesn't really go into detail what allows some of the themes to occur.  You just accept them at face value.

In the original, each show stood on its own with nothing to do with the other shows and Kolchak was deliberately unhip and alone.  By calling this show the Night Stalker instead of just coming up with a new title, the show created too many expectations based on nostalgia which probably helped doom it.

When I realized that Frank Spotnitz was the Executive Producer and writer for the ""re-vision"" (as it's been called on another website) I hoped this would make this series watchable.  I also loved the ""X Files"" (of course--duh) and, while I knew this ""Night Stalker"" wouldn't be the ""X-Files"" I was hoping for similar writing, storylines, etc.  I was hoping to be as engaged and kept-on-the-edge-of-my-seat as I was with most episodes of the ""X Files"" (save for those horrible years when Duchovny was absent from the series).

What a disappointment!

I stuck it out for 2 episodes before finally giving up.  The storylines are contrived and not completely fleshed out.  The acting is mediocre at best and the lead character essentially stumbles through the episodes I watched.  The entire time I was thinking, ""Geez, this is bad.  I really could be doing something more interesting with my time--and money.""  I finally gave into these thoughts, popped the DVD out, and stuck the series in the pile of DVDs that I will be re-selling.

I can't really think of or offer anything that would make this even remotely watchable to people--unless you rarely watch TV series on DVDs, have time to waste, don't have any expectations of what you'll be experiencing, and have never seen either the original ""Night Stalker"" or ""X Files.""",1173312000,6,1525,4.91796875

To use ""Night Stalker"" as the title for this mind-numbing, and completely boring series is truly a sin.  The only thing that remotely reminds me of the former series is the use of character's names from the original Night Stalker series.  There's no humor, no inventiveness, no bumbling yet brilliant ""monster-chasing"" reporter.... absolutely nothing to make this as good as the original cult favorite.

In this Night Stalker we get dark sets, dark clothing for all actors, drab lighting and long-winded pompous speeches.  Sound familiar?  It should!  It's the X-Files with new actors and new names!!  But even the X Files occasionally spoofed itself, making it appealing.  Nothing doing here.

There are good actors here, but their talents are completely wasted.  Too bad.  However, I guess they gotta eat like everyone else.",1173225600,6,1073,4.921787709497207
2525669,5,B000EOTV98,"I was a big fan of this series and couldn't believe it was cancelled before it was allowed time to find an audience.  Not a hero from the 70's, Stuart Townsend is a contemporary Kolchak, a reporter tortured by unanswered questions about his wife's death and determined to discover the truth.  Definitely for adults, with plenty of graphic violence and psychological games.

Normally a show isn't available on DVD unless it ran multiple seasons, or at least one complete season.  This two-disc set contains all ten episodes of the series that were produced, including several never broadcast, plus a nice featurette and scripts outlining where the series would have gone had it been given the chance.",1169596800,4,699,5.0
2525670,3,B000EOTV98,"Remaking a classic movie is hard enough. Remaking a TV series is far worse. So it was with groans of dismay that viewers greeted ""Night Stalker,"" a remake of the classic horror/humor/scifi series.

Fortunately, the resulting series is not actually that bad. But unfortunately it's not that good either -- it has little in common with the original series, but it never establishes a style or identity for itself either. As a result, it comes across as ""Mulder and Scully working at the Beacon.""

A pregnant housewife is kidnapped and found horribly mutilated in the desert. Perri Reed (Gabrielle Union) is assigned to the task, but soon finds herself working with Carl Kolchak (Stuart Townsend), a strange reporter whose wife died in a manner identical to the murdered housewife. Only when Perri starts to believe in Kolchak are they able to find who did it.

In the weeks that follow, Kolchak and Perri encounter many bizarre crimes --  a killer who can manipulate people's minds, a college hazing becomes ensnared in a ghost's terror, a dead bioterrorist seems to be killing again, demonic possession, and apocalyptic bikers.

Additionally, there are four episodes that had been filmed when ABC yanked the plug on this one. The first wraps up the storyline of a two-parter, and then it's back to the weird and wild: mummified office workers, Kolchak is kidnapped, and an episode based on the ""Night Strangler"" TV movie.

Don't expect any resemblance to ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" here. Kolchak is no longer an eccentric lone wolf, but a pouty crime expert with a comely sidekick, who is very conventional and skeptical. No humor. No mythic creatures. And apparently a love of truth is not enough to motivate Kolchak -- the creators gave him a rather hackneyed ""revenge"" motive.

Yeah, it sounds like the ""X-Files."" Even the FBI persecuting Kolchak seems too X-Filesian, not to mention the presence of The Pretty Skeptic Lady, and the Kindly And Tolerant Superior Who Puts Up With Weird Reports. It was made by the same people who made ""X-Files,"" but couldn't they have varied the formula a little?

Taken on its own, ""Night Stalker"" is a fairly entertaining series -- there are some wonderfully spooky moments, such as the scene in the werewolf cave. Dialogue is pretty average. And though the shakycam style is a little annoying, the camerawork is quite nice -- eerie lighting and pulsing streets make the city look surreal, nightmarish and almost alive.

Townsend and Union are both pretty good in their roles. Not great, but good. Townsend is at his best in ""interview"" scenes, where he gets up close and personal with everything from a crazed murderer to a frightened little girl. He's a bit wooden in the more emotional scenes, while Union is steady but never gets a chance to show any more depth.

""The Night Stalker"" is a fairly enjoyable series -- though it never comes close to the original -- but it suffers from the ""X-Files"" formula. Otherwise, it's a fairly amusing way to get your scares.",1163548800,3,3005,4.874509803921568

Any resemblance with ""The Night Stalker"" with Darren McGavin is purely coincidental.  Essentially, they used the title and character names but nothing else resembles the real Night Stalker.  What this series is, is a lot of hip-moody music, dark shadowing lighting, popular dizzying camera cuts, and very lame stories.

Comparing this with the original, this series had a more serious and young Carl Kolchak and the 1970's Night Stalker had an older man who was not so so serious.  This is really the only difference and that ticks people off for some reason. I don't like what the critics say about this show. This show deserves 5 stars for the effort to make this better than the original. But...people didn't like that and that's fine with me. I enjoyed both the original and this show.  I give this show two thumbs up!  Since I can't write another review because Amazon won't let us.  I also wanted to ask every fan of this show to somehow contact Frank Spotnitz to make a 2-3 hour movie that will clear up this confusion that people have about the show. I don't like that when people review this show that because their confused and don't understand it, they say this show is bad. I know the Firefly series was ended with a not a very good ending and then Serenity came out which was made into a movie that was more than 2 hours long. Maybe Frank Spotnitz can do this with ""actually"" completing this whole series of Night Stalker. I want to encourage those fans to somehow contact him or someone like Chris Charter that can get a hold of him. I really would like this series to end well.

Such is the case with this update of THE NIGHT STALKER.  We never find out why or who or what killed Kolchak's wife; some villains simply vanish; and the last episode only opens the door to unanswered questions again.

Too bad, because this X-FILES like series had a lot going for it, with its high production values, interesting editing and cinematography.  Never one of my favorite actors, I was finally beginning to warm up to Stuart Townsend's Kolchak and even the tiresome skepticism of Gabrielle Union's Perri.  Eric Jungman as Jain was superb as was John Pyper-Ferguson as the unlikeable FBI agent.  Since I never watched XFILES, I wasn't aware of the similiarity of the plotlines, but each of the episodes on this two disc set were intriguing and well done.

I lost the tapes, or eventually taped something else over them, but decided to give it a shot when it came out on DVD, and bought the set.  I was extremely (and pleaantly) surprised -- there was no attempt to craft look-alike/act-alike/sound-alike roles (after all, no one could one-up Darren McGavin playing Darren McGavin).  They took a fresh, new approach to the material which I found immediately engrossing.  Half-way through watching the 10 episodes on the DVDs, I felt a sudden loss:  in this show's cancellation, gone was the chance that this show would evolve -- as it most surely would have -- into the next ""X-Files"" (after all, it even had an ""X-Files"" director at its helm).  With a little more creative license from ABC (which declared that all of the ""monsters"" must be humans), this show would have become the enigmatic touchtone that returned Sci-Fi to the major networks.  It's cancellation is a true loss.  I only wish that I had watched it when it originally aired, so that I could have helped in the effort to save it (something I had not even thought of doing for any series aside from ""Twin Peaks"").

2525677,5,B000EOTV98,"Well isn't that a surprise, ABC cancels another good series that has so much potential can anyone say ""Invasion""!! ABC is notorious for axing good shows right before they start and ""Night Stalker"" wasn't any different. Ignore the other reviews panning this series. It was actually very good.

The acting by Stuart Townsend, Gabrielle Union and the rest of the cast was EXCELLENT. The stories had a mix of the supernatural and regular drama. Stuart as Kolchak is being investigated for the death of his wife but along the way of cf clearing his name he investigates violent and mysterious cases. I would also like to say for the idiots who say this is an X-Files ripoff to do your homework. The X-Files was not the first show to deal with aliens in a serious form can you say ""War Of the Worlds from 1988"". Actually as well the other cancelled CBS show ""Threshold"" was more closer to the X-FIles that this show. ""Night Stalker"" was also part cop show, and not only a show on supernatural.

The ratings were a problem but ABC like to juggle this show around hoping it would fail putting it one bad timeslot to the next. They just never gave this show a chance, and if you doubt if these show has fans you to go some of the SciFi boards on the net and you'll notice that it's gotten quite a following.

In the DVD release you get to see the rest of the unaired episodes that would have aired but didn't. I will say that the rest of these episodes are very good, and do seem to bring many things together. If you are a fan of the new series the DVD is a must have.",1152576000,6,1560,4.299319727891157
2525678,2,B000EOTV98,"The new Night Stalker seem a TV clone. They smell and taste  like the X-Files, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Dark Shadows, with a nod of the hat to the classic Kolchak The Night Stalker.

When Dan Curtis produced this show in the 1970's, the show had an edge of the occult-it was so mysterous. Then there was Files and many shows like it.

The new Carl Kolshak, played by Stuart Townsend, seem so too cool for the role, not like Darrin McGavin did in the 70's. He drives a hip car with police scanner,  nice pressed clothes rather than a wrinkled suit nand over equiped for every mystery

 This Kolchak show seems to act more and more like Fox Mulder, than a hard hitting news reporter. His back story acted like the Fugitive, with the supposed killing of his wife as part of his Mythos.

Gabrielle Union , who plays  Perri the ""senior crime reporter"" who has worked at the LA Beacon for all of four years, seems wasted in her role  of second Banana to Townsend's Kolchak. Union is a good actress normally. However she is NO SCULLY, trust me...she acts like eye candied, girl wonder to Kolchak..and fails badly. There could have been mjore fleshiness to her character, other than the one dimension she shows here.

Lets say the acting is good NOT great and the storylines are bad VERY bad. Most of you WILL feel as if you watched them before...X-Files fans take note, YOU ARE EXCUSED from watching...files did a better job!

The show lasted six episodes of TV. When it was merrifully pulled for ABC TV, the show  had 4 episodes unaired . This set includes them..and a DVD rom feature is a missing script which was not shot, due to the series being canceled

2525679,5,B000EOTV98,"A note of caution: This series is WAY too intense and scary for kids under 12 years old.  The 2005 series the Night Stalker is a very well written and well acted show.  That is probably why it failed on broadcast TV.  This Carl Kolshak, played expertly by Stuart Townsend, is a man haunted by the mysterious and brutal death of his wife.  He was there when she was killed, and no one really believes him as to how she was killed.  Many think Carl is a murderer, but they can not prove it.  This spiritual/emotional/psychological tension in apparent in most of the episodes.  It casts a shadow on all that Carl does, especially his relationahips with co-workers.  Some of the episodes have resolutions, but some do not. This makes the show really kind of edgy and true to life.  Why do so many TV show writers think all of life's problems can be solved in a 45 minute time slot?  The best episodes deal with the ""monsters"" concept, but others are just serial killers.
  The acting is excellent.  Gabrielle Union is fabulous as Perri the ""senior crime reporter"" who has worked at the LA Beacon for all of four years.  Besides being a great actress, Gabrielle Union is simply beautiful.  Perri struggles to try to fingure out what is going on in the cases they investigate, but also she tries to understand why Carl does what he does.
  The newspaper's photographer is another interesting character.  He tags along with Perri and Carl on many investigations.  This threesome is rather unique in television and adds to the quality of th show.  Unfortunately, the photographer's name is very hard to catch.  It is Jain, sounds like Jane, for a man, really unusual.  Why did the writer's do that?
  The background music is suitable and sets the tone well.  The only major grievance I have with this series is that too often the victims seem to be women killed by a man.  That may mirror life, but it was too emphasized.
  All in all the new Night Stalker is a great series, but not for children.  You may like the show if you can live with  ongoing unresolved issues tormenting the main character.",1151971200,23,2091,4.557951482479784
2525680,1,B000EOTV98,"Perhaps naming this new program ""The Night Stalker"" was a disservice that contributed to the program being cancelled after the first season. Those of us who remember the classic old series starring Darren McGavin are likely to be disappointed. I know I was. The bumbling nature of the original Kolchak character was part of the show's charm. He stumbled into supernatural situations and just barely pulled through each episode with his life.

If the new show had aired under a different name I think it would have been a great success. The program delves into some creepy stuff - and as some other reviewers have mentioned it has definite ""X-Files"" overtones. I was disappointed that it wasn't the ""old"" Night Stalker, but enjoyed it enough to add it to my video collection.",1151798400,7,774,4.863636363636363
2525681,3,B000EOTV98,"Being a fan of the classic Darren McGavin series, I was pretty excited when I heard they were remaking this series.  Unfortunately, didn't get a chance to see this air, so I picked up the boxed set when it came out.

Simply put, this was a poorly made series.  Tries to reimagine the 70's show and attempts to be more intelligent and hip, fails dismally in all 3 (as opposed to say the ""Battlestar Galactica"" 80's original remake which I found to be pretty good).  The stories and plot were excruciatingly dragging and, well, ridicuous (For example, the antagonists in the Pilot episode appeared to be monster coyotes who could levitate, had a penchant for sniffing out pregnant women and devouring their fetuses, and who also had the ability to lift beds while flying and kidnap children!). I blame the scriptwriters for this.  The monotonous piano theme music which permeated throughout the series didn't help (would've been hip in the 90's, not now).  This show pales in comparison to contemporary TV Horror shows like ""Supernatural"".

Still, there were pros.  Stuart Townsend and cos' acting was okay.  Guest shot of Darren McGavin in the Pilot was a nice tribute to the old show and pretty rewarding for old time fans.  No one's TV Horror series collection would be complete without this set, particularly fans of the old series.

Get this ONLY if you are a die hard horror fan (which I am).  If you're not, this is something you may wish to avoid.",1151625600,5,1453,4.722222222222222
2525682,3,B000EOTV98,"The best way to watch this series (especially if you have affection for the original Kolchak) is to disregard any connection to the 1970's show. There is little resemblance between the two except the names of some characters. Just take this new version as a series about reporters investigating mysterious deaths and unexplained events. If these episodes smell a lot like the ""X-Files,"" that's no real surprise since most of the writers and producers worked on that show.

My personal bias is that I prefer answers to mysteries that are posed (at least eventually), and this series provides few. Granted the plug was pulled before some storylines could be resolved, but often I felt the writers were trying to be intentionally vague or just too lazy to come up with a fully realized story.

On the positive side, the series is well acted and beautifully shot. The episodes are suspenseful and diverting if you don't mind some ambiguity. The two commentaries on the set are interesting and worth a listen.

Here are my mini-reviews of the ten episodes (with grades):

PILOT: Introduces somber reporter Kolchak, whose wife died under mysterious circumstances, and his team of colleagues. A series of gory deaths lead them to track strange creatures in the desert. Briskly paced with some genuinely chilling moments. Watch for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it ""cameo"" by Darren McGavin, the one, true Kolchak. B+

THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HELL: A prisoner in solitary confinement is able to psychically influence people on the outside to commit terrible acts. A surprisingly effective episode that has a nice twist at the end (even though you see it coming). A-

THREE: People begin dying from their worst fears. A dull story that falls back on the worn device of using ghosts as an excuse to show a bunch of ""scary"" imagery. C

BURNING MAN: Someone is sending figurines that cause the recipients to burst into flames. Not a particularly novel plot, this episode goes light on the supernatural element and leaves a key question unanswered. B-

MALUM: Bad things befall people who cross paths with a young boy and his sinister father. The central mystery is not terribly mystifying and, even worse, is not particularly riveting. B-

THE SOURCE: Kolchak pursues a man who may have answers he seeks about his wife's death, while a gang of zombie bikers shoots up everyone in sight. More action-packed than usual. B

THE SEA: Conclusion of THE SOURCE in which Kolchak and Co. protect a woman from the ghostly Hell's Angels. Some nice action, but again too few answers are offered (So what's with those zombie bikers anyway?) to leave the viewer feeling truly satisfied. B-

INTO NIGHT: Kolchak tries to uncover what's turning people into mummies. There are a few frights along the way, but the story is strangely uninvolving. At least there is a halfway plausible explanation for the events. B-

TIMELESS: Young women are murdered and mutilated, and Kolchak suspects someone is using them as a source of eternal youth. The premise is unoriginal, but this episode manages to wring some unsettling moments from it. Guest starring the ""French chick"" from ""Lost"" in another bizarre role. B+

WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY, KOLCHAK?: One of those maddening episodes that is all set up and no payoff. Kolchak is kidnapped and held captive in a plot that's part ""Misery"" and part ""The Thing at the End of the Hall."" The suspense builds effectively, but the frustrating final act brings no resolution. B-",1151452800,2,3479,4.9468267581475125

(ABC is notoriously known for pulling the plug of great shows commander in chief, invasion are few examples). the dvd is also superb. the images are sharp clear and voice quality is awesome. overall worth buying. (i paid 15 including shipping)",1151366400,,807,4.771428571428571
2525684,5,B000EOTV98,"I bought this set intrigued by the premise of the show and the involvement of an extremely talented cast and crew but skeptical since it was cancelled after just six episodes? Could a really great show (or any show with any redeeming qualities) be cancelled so quickly? The answer is a definite YES and this show proves it.

I never saw any of the origional Night Stalker movies or the TV show so I can't compare this show to the origional material, I can only talk about this show on it's own merits, which given the considerable difference seen in this show to the origional seems fairer anyway. This is a very dark and exquisitely creepy show. It's intelligently wirtten and produced and it works on several levels. For a show that deals with the supernatural (esentially things that don't exist) it dose a terrific job of bringing you into the story and getting inside your head which makes it far scarier then just getting something to jump out of the dark and decimal level jumps from 0-100 in a split second. It's also just great popcorn, escapism, cool, slick horror/drama. And trust me this is dark and scary stuff.

Firstly this is the most strikingly beautiful show I've ever seen. It's shot in high definition, much the same way the movie ""Collateral"" was shot, and the producers took full advantage of their locations, using L.A to it's full. It's especially striking at night time when the camera picks up so much and given the shows title much of it is shot at night.

Stuart Townsend is absolutely fantastic as Carl Kolchak. Kolchak is a dark, brooding, mysterious, selfish, single-mindedly driven man yet he is also warm, engaging, funny, charasmatic and charming, not to mention full of despair for what happend to his wife while also mainting an optimistic outlook for what he dose. Townsend manages to encorporate all these things into the character seemlessly and naturally.

Gabrille Union is a very fine actrees and plays a sort of two-dimensional Perri Reed very well indeed. Eric Jungman as photographer Jain Mcmanus is terrific and adds some well needed comic relief.

THE PILOT episode is a solid if slightly unspectacular episode. The storyline is not that engaging as it lacks any real origionality. However the deeper mystery of what happened to Kolchak's wife, his possible involvement in her death and the mysterious mark on Kolchaks wrist that also appears on the wrist of certain people who have died mysterious deaths makes this episode engaging.

Epsidoe 2, ""The Five People You Meet In Hell"" is one of the best. Extremely dark and creepy with a terrific villian, an engaing and interesting story, beautifully directed by X-Files veteran Rob Bowman and some great scenes between Kolchak and Reed which really deepen their relationship.

""Three"" is an excellent episode. It's by no means an origional storyline but it's made so well it truly dosen't feel predictable at all.

""Burning Man"" is the weakest episode for me but by no means poor. The problem with it lies in the fact that the storyline dosen't lend itself to a supernatural story, nor is it one, but nonetheless one was added unnecessarily.

""Malum"" is superb. The guest cast of actors are simply phenomenal, the story has many twist and turns and keeps you guessing right until the brilliant and surprising finale.

""The Source"" and ""The Sea"" is a magnificent two-parter where the show really begins to fufil it's potential. The story behind Kolchak and what the mark could possibly mean are explored and developed brilliantly and it is so madening when you watch these episodes realising where the show could've gone.

""Into Night"" is a very fine episode.

""Timeless"" is an interesting one because it's very creppy, very disturbing and grusome with lots of intrigue and mystery yet it seems to lack a certain something to really make the episode complete. I like the fact the audience is left to join the dots at the end but even though it's not the story still feels slight unfinished.

Keep the best till last! ""What's The Frequency, Kolchak?"" is written but Vince Gilligan who was responsible for many of the finest episodes of The X-Files and here he delivers an absolutely phenomenal piece of television. It's an absolutely brilliant story and psychological horror at it's absolute best. It's a tour de force for Stuart Townsend as an actor and brilliantly casts doubt once again on the sanity of the lead character. It's thrilling, origional, edge-of-your-seat drama at it's absolute finest.

I was so impressed by this show. Granted it lacks a certain origionality, and the mysteries won't have you asking as many questions as ""Lost"" and of course fans of The X-Files will see subtle similarities in the stories but make no mistake this is no X-Files copy and is definitely worth seeking out. For very obvious reasons you will be left with lots of questions when you finish the set but the within the commentaries Frank Spotnitz reveals many of the shows secrets and where the show would have gone so you gain some sort of resolution.

The fact that the person who wrote for this series also wrote for some X Files episodes is ironic considering that Chris Carter, the creator of the X Files, stated that the original Night Stalker was an inspiration. This series attempted to be like the X Files by being 'mysterious' and totally reworking the original Night Stalker series, but it failed due to bad casting, writing and a main storyline that nobody really cared about.

2525687,4,B000EOTV98,"OK... so its not the fond memories of your childhood -- but go back and really watch all those things you remember so fondly. You'll find a lot of hokey, corny and really lame things that time has washed over.

I loved Darren McGavin, he was one of the great, unsung actors of our time. He was charming, funny and always entertained you in no matter what he was doing --- including The Natural, The Christmas Story and the of course, ""original"" Night Stalker movies and series. Who can forget, the creepy, Rakshasa, or the sight of the hissing Vampire peering over the staircase in the original movie. Like a roller-coaster ride -- those shows had their ups and downs and were great.

So flash-forward to 2005 and the remake... no reinterpetation is a better label. Same character names, but a different point of view, one that lives in today's world. Its rougher, visually stunning and scary. I remember when it came on, I hated it  -- because I was expecting what I remebered from when I was 8 years old... Then I purchased those old shows on DVD and was surprised how some were really great -- but some were just lame.

The ""new"" Night Stalker, is what it is. A very stylized, well acted, modern interpetation of an intrepid reporter going places that no one dares -- to find out whats hiding under the bed. Stuart Townsend is a very good actor, and as the new Carl Kolchak, and it was unfair that he was dimissed by so many ""fans"" of the old series who couldn't let go of McGavin's image. It is like comparing James Bonds -- everyone has a favorite and no one is actually wrong -- it's just a point of view.

If the show was given the grace of developing - which it should have -- the actors would have grown onto their roles and discovered a new audience who would have appreciated them.  I stayed up to watch the unaired episodes last week, and you know what... they were entertaining -- one was a remake of the Night Strangler, in a way -- the other ""What's the Frequency, Kolchak"" was creepy and kept you watching on the edge of your seat until the last second! And isn't that what a good scare is supposed to do?

So if you enjoy good acting, great cinematography and can let go of the past -- put these DVDs on and join Frank Sponitz's crew for awhile and sit back, turn off the lights and don't forget to lock the doors -- and be scared!",1149552000,6,2348,4.34703196347032
2525688,5,B000EOTV98,"If you are a fan of the original Nightstalker, it's a good chance you will absolutely hate this version. Why? Because it's nothing like the original. It dares to take itself seriously, which the originally only did once in awhile. The terrible thing about it is that this was actually a good show. And like a previous reviewer mentioned, had it been named something else and put on at another time-slot and actually advertised, it might still be on the air.

This show was a darker X-files (think of a series made up of X-file episodes like ""Kill Switch"" and ""Home""), but the two characters were extremely witty. Sure Perri Reid (Gabrielle Union) seemed like Scully at times and Carl Kolchak (Stuart Townsend) an extention of Mulder, but there was a different mythology, one of which I would have loved to seen the end of. Irene's death, Carl's mark, the mystery of where the biker's went or if they were even alive are all left to the viewer's imagination, unfortunately.

Fortunately, this two-disc offering does give the fans a little something to be happy about. It features 4 un-aired episodes, scripts for 2 more episodes, 2 commentaries, deleted scenes and a nice chat with Frank Spotnitz, himself. And thankfully, it allows the fans to see the second part of the two-parter ABC decided not to show. The best of the un-aired episodes is ""What's the frequency, Kolchak?"" in which the show explores some serious psycological horror. That's what this show was best at-freaking your mind out.

One thing that did become evident watching and re-watching the shows is that Perri and Carl were going to have to resolve some of that tension they had going on and they wouldn't have been able to legitimately stretch five years and a movie before they kissed (or almost kissed), and that may have resulted in the show becoming stale. Because let's face it, everyone always wants the two leads together but rarely is it done right and it leaves the viewer stunned. So if anything positive came out of Nightstalker being cancelled, it was the fact that it was never messed up with a shoddy romance.",1149120000,7,2094,4.763085399449036
2525689,5,B000EOTV98,"Okay, I've just watched both discs and all shows therein (over a couple of days, mind you) and I have to say this was a really good show getting better. However, I have to concede that quite possibly the big mistake this show made was calling itself a remake of ""Night Stalker"".Doing such a thing places built in expectations of the show and the original ""Kolchak-The Night Stalker"" is almost iconic. Maybe, if this show had been a stand alone and given another title, it might still be with us today. Good scripts, good cast, interesting.  Some of the blame, of course, has to be placed on the stations. They seem to be more interested in quick, cheap fixes (eg reality shows ad nauseum) and don't give the good stuff a chance. No wonder I tend to read at night.",1149033600,16,763,4.45
2525690,1,B000EOTV98,"In my opinion, this is absolutely the worst remake of a television series ever done.

I don't know what Mr. Spotnitz was thinking on this baby, but he should retire and live off his X-Files and Millenium residuals, because this turkey is the worst show ever.

If you are into collecting the worst of the worst, then this one is for you.

Otherwise, save your money and catch Darren McGavin in the original tv series on dvd.",1148947200,2,423,4.467532467532467
2525691,4,B000EOTV98,"I'm sure, if you've heard of this 2005 version of Night Stalker, you've heard all the negative things said about it. Over 95% of these negative comments are from people who are offended that this ""remake"" completely abandons the original ""Kolchak the Night Stalker"".

Well, I'm glad it did.

I realize that the original series has a sizeable cult fanbase. I can respect that. But that fanbase grew up with the show and watched it in the 70s. It's now 2005, and the fact that the original failed in the 70s should obviously tell you that it's not going to work in 2005.

The new Night Stalker chooses psychological horror, rather than the original's overuse of showing the monsters and creatures. This show makes its characters believable, not silly like the original. This show is an even darker version of ""The X-Files"", but in some ways better.

Like I said before, this series uses mainly psychological horror to frighten it's viewers. What I find funny is the fact that everyone insults supernatural shows on television because they're not creative enough, they use stuff the viewer SEES to scare them, etc., and when a show comes along to scare viewers with what's NOT necessarily seen, it's rejected.

Anyway, the new Night Stalker is a visual feast, using advanced HD cameras that create a realistic feel to the show. Everything on screen looks fantastic. The cast is both attractive and capable, all of them are established actors and make their characters likeable.

Like ""The X-Files"", this show has a mythology. Only instead of investigating an alien invasion, ""Night Stalker"" has it's lead investigating the meaning of a red snake-shaped mark on the wrists of certain victims, which usually die by supernatural means, but, other than that, appear to be unrelated. At the end of the pilot we discover that Carl, who started investigating the mark after the violent, brutal death of his wife, also bears the mark on his wrist.

I do believe that this show could have succeeded. It was a slick, suspenseful thriller that could have become the next X-Files, but ABC banished it to a terrible time slot, Thursdays against CSI, The Apprentice, Everwood, etc. The show also received NO off-network advertising, since the network pumped everything into ""Commander-in-Chief"". Despite this, enough viewers tuned in to the premiere that the show could have at least lasted one entire season, but after the premiere ABC advertised the show even LESS, not reminding people it was on, yet they still heavily advertised every new episode of Desperate Housewives and Lost, although the viewers of those established shows are obviously going to keep tuning in.

If you're a horror fan, this new reimagining of Night Stalker is a must-see.",1148860800,5,2733,4.964989059080962
2525692,4,B000EOTV98,"The newest version of The Night Stalker pales in comparison to the original starring Darren McGavin.
Some of us are starved for this genre of television, that we will watch to hope it comes close to the excellence of the old series - This DVD is worth purchasing for the meeting of the new Kolchak with the old in the newsroom - episode 1. Darren McGavin, reading a newpaper, wearing his trademark hat, nods to the new Kolchak - it is a classic homage from the old to the new.
The new series got caught up in some silliness and never held the watcher as the original. But for me, seeing the 2 Kolchaks was worth the DVD price.
However,I was a fan of the 'new' Night Stalker - made you think that the truth is out there beyond your reach...and not every series can say that.",1148774400,2,773,4.26530612244898
2525693,2,B000EOTV98,"The Night Stalker legacy keeps getting worse and worse.  The movies were 5 stars, the first tv show was 4 stars, the only reason I gave this two stars was they will probably come out with a one star Night Stalker - The Musical.  The second series was average.  Why did they even call this Night Stalker, I guess just to get it on the air.  It had absolutely nothing to do with the original, except for a couple of names and he drove a Mustang.  They should have tied it into the original by saying he was Carl Kolchak, Jr.  It was poorly written, they never explained how a newspaperman could afford a high class place, did he have a lot of insurance on his wife?  I will buy this though because I have the movies and first series on DVD.  It is definitely not worth $29.99, but I don't feel like waiting until it goes down to it's proper price of $14.99 because it will probably be like some of those other DVDs that if you don't buy them now, you'll have to pay $100 in the future.",1148342400,,983,4.136842105263158
2525694,1,B000EOTV98,"This is proof positive that everything and anything will eventually be slapped onto DVD. This series (at least the episodes that actually aired) has to be one of the most worthless things ever put onto network television (and that is no easy feat). Lousy writing, exceedingly poor character development, and worst of all the 'play coy with the viewer' mentality as regards actually displaying some sort of monster. That sort of trick can work when the menace is sufficiently built up through competent direction and writing, not to mention capable actors, but none of these qualities were anywhere near this show. 'The Changeling' or 'Devil's Backbone' this fiasco isn't. As if the show's insipid attempt to lift everything that didn't work on 'X-Files' wasn't bad enough, they have to go and slap the Kolchak name on it, adding Carl Kolchak to the ever growing list of classic and beloved characters who are dragged through the mud by people who clearly have neither appreciation nor affection for their source material.",1146787200,9,1021,5.047337278106509
2525695,2,B000EOTV98,"The Kolchak Redux series, I believe, exemplifies what's wrong with the entertainment media: ""Re-imagining "" classic TV series in a hipper, fashionable, sexier, and more politically correct format.  This grave-robbing and desecration has been done with the Fantastic Four, Dukes of Hazzard, Star Trek, and Battlestar Galactica.  In the process of revising and  revamping a classic series, the essential charm is always lost.

The Redux series involved two sins. First, this is not Kolchack: he was always an outsider. He is a washed-up forty-something reporter as uncool as his seersucker suit and straw porkchop hat.  The NuKolchak, however, was too hip, too classy in his Abercrombie & Fitch SlayerWear.

Also, Kolchak was a loner. You could never picture him as married, or working with someone.  In fact, the relationship between NuKolchak and Perri was a smudge reproduction of Mulder and Scully, but more on that later.

The second sin is more of a miscalculation on the producer's part.  Back in the 70's, the only supernatural programming we got, besides the silver-age horror films, was ""Night Gallery,"" ""Project Bluebook,"" the Bigfoot episodes of Bionic Man, and ""In Search Of . . ."" (narrated by Leonard Nemoy).  By virture of this scarcity, Kolchak stood out among the Clone Army of cop program (SWAT, Barretta, Charlie's Angels, Police Woman, and, um, Kojak).

Nowadays, everyone has a working knowledge of the paranormal.  Frank Spotnitz  and Daniel Sackheim are victims of the success of the ""X-Files,"" which brought the paranormal into the mainstream. Added to this, you have the incessant Bigfoot-UFO documentaries on TLC and Discovery, the TV series Roswell, the new Archie cartoon, and the overnight radio ""Coast to Coast AM.""  In other words, the paranormal market is supersaturated, and has therefore become clich? and utterly boring.  Kolchak's off-beatness has become the sounding drum of all TV.

On these two accounts-the ambush makeover for Carl and the lack of uniqueness-doomed the series.  Admit it: the real problem was that the show was a poser for Kolchak, but ultimately pulled a ""bate and switch"" and gave us ""X-Files: Los Angels.""  By the way, if they had cast this series as an X-Files spin-off, it probably would have fared much better. The fans of BOTH original series-Kolchak and X-Files-would be happier, and the series could cut its own way, without the seersucker suit baggage.",1146268800,26,2418,5.188144329896907

They never did show the conclusion.  I could not believe it, I kept it on my Tivo for months hoping they would run the conclusion to a very compelling story.

I don't dislike the original but it was corny.  It had a nice campy feel.  the newer was darker and more interesting and I like shows with story arcs.

I can't wait for this to get on DVD although I downloaded  some episodes but I was sad that ABC didn't bother to cultivate the show.  hopefully after it airs on SCif-fi Cahnnel it will get the following it deserves and maybe we'll get a movie out of it.",1143417600,,663,4.15748031496063
2525699,3,B000EOTV98,"Okay: this is not the Night Stalker.  That was ABC's, and the producer Frank Spotnitz, first mistake.

To link it with the Darren McGavin classic was idiotic.  It was clearly more a spinoff of the X-Files than the Night Stalker.  Stuart Townsend was no Carl Kolchak.  He was Fox Mulder who was in serious need of anti-depressants.  I mean he made Mulder seem happy.

That is not to say the show did not have potential.  It did. There were some genuinely creepy moments and some good episodes in this short-lived thriller.  And I'll give it this: you didn't need to guess that something supernatural was going on.  No subtlety here.  It hit you in the head like a 2x4.  Which happened to work in this case.  The ""Jimmy Olsen"" tag along kid was a good touch.  They should have lost the cynical chick who tagged along for the ride.  And there was absolutely no rapport between Anthony Vincenzo and the new Carl.

They should have released this as: That reporter sleuth of the supernatural featuring ""Carl Kane"" and ""Jimmy Olsen"".  A little more thinking; and a good idea the writers knew where they were going; and you may have had a great atmospheric show that would still be on today.  Many times, these writers ask question after question after question, but clearly do not have any answers.  They just keep asking questions; and hope nobody notices.  Think ""Lost"" knows where it is going,--guess again.  I hope I am wrong, but I doubt the writers of ""Lost"" know what the end game of their show will be.  I'll be surprised if I am wrong.  The Pretender was the same; and the writers of the much acclaimed ""Nowhere Man"" series actually admitted they were better at asking questions than answering them.

So I had the same feeling with this version of the Night Stalker.  It's all about story; and unfortunately, the entertainment industry (movies and television both) have forgotten that.  After 100 years, and countless remakes, the industry is in a coma.  It will continue on for awhile; but do not expect much in the way of entertainment--unless you want to watch a classic from the past.  Forget Bewitched the movie; buy Bewitched the t.v. show.  If that is what you like.

I'll stick with the two television movies and 20 episodes of ""Kolchak: the Night Stalker""; and leave this remake for others who do not know any better.

I have heard the Scifi channel may be airing these in the future.  The show may not be completely dead yet.  Maybe given a little more time, the small potential I saw, may get a chance to blossom into something different and better--but never Carl Kolchak: the Night Stalker.  Darren McGavin (may he rest in Eternal Peace in the PRESENCE OF THE LIVING & TRIUNE GOD) will always be Kolchak.  That era has past, along with him.
