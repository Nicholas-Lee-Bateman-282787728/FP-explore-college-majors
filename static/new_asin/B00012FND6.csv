1968056,5,B00012FND6,Thank you Animal Yoga for all the Great Yoga poses you have taught my kids!!  They Love your DVD and can't wait to get home from school and do their YOGA!  I think more TV programs should incorporate this Type of effective interactive activity in their programs!  Thanks Again & Let me know when your Next Volume is out & ready!!  Much Luv From Your Fans.,1092960000,3,355,4.333333333333333
1968057,5,B00012FND6,I have bought all the kids yoga videos you can find on the market. Animal Yoga is by far the best one out there. My kids love it. They were totally absorbed by the magical world of Wasabi Sunshine and Lil Chi. I believe Yoga benefits kids and Animal Yoga developed a very creative way to teach the kids strong basic skills while having fun. I have noticed tremendous progress in my kids ability to practice the poses in just a few days.,1092873600,9,436,4.265060240963855
1968058,5,B00012FND6,Kids love it. They watch the video twice a day !,1092787200,3,48,3.4545454545454546
1968059,5,B00012FND6,"This DVD is very original, and it overwhelmingly appeals to its audience...KIDS! Kids as young as 2 start to get it, but surprisingly I have seen a 12 year old girl dig it. For ages 6 and 7 it is just magical, and for kid's a little older, they like the technical side as well as the hip hop. It really gets kids off the couch and involved. It was created to keep kids active and to fight obesity, diabetes, ADHD and stress. Autistic kids like it as well. It is really quite amazing how much children enjoy this show. They watch it over and over again, and it is postively healthy programming so you can feel great about giving this to your kids.",1092614400,2,646,4.217741935483871
1968060,4,B00012FND6,"but a good introduction.  I agree with one of the reviewers who mentions the somewhat cheesy production and hostesses.  Their costumes are weird.  Most of the conversation is in a rap format.  There is some history of Yoga thrown in, along with a small dance break in the middle, which shows some break dance/hip-hop moves.  African Animals are used to introduce most of the yoga moves.  Children are encouraged to listen to their bodies, so they don't over stretch.  Some of the moves covered were cobra, downward facing dog, and warrior pose.  Though they have been renamed with animal names.  The poses are shown twice.  Once by the hostesses, and then intercut with clips of kids doing the poses.  Breathing techniques are covered briefly.  My 3 1/2 yr. old loved it, but couldn't not do all the moves.  After a couple of viewings it started to grow on me.",1092182400,,860,4.691275167785235
1968061,5,B00012FND6,"I ordered a copy of this video and was so happy with it.  I have four children under 10 and they all enjoy it.  One of my kids has ADHD and has always had an interest in yoga.  This video gives him a place to channel his energy and learn focus and breathing.  What a blessing!  My 4 year old enjoys all the fun dance breaks in the video.  He has mastered the breakdance move and shows off at all family parties!  The video has done a good job in keeping it interesting for children to learn the poses.  The combination of live action, animation and crazy names is perfect.  This video is great for home but would be a terrific gift.  I would recommend preschools and elementary movement classes check it out as well.",1088380800,,716,4.237037037037037
1968062,5,B00012FND6,"This is a great addition to the video/dvd library.  As a working mom, living in the city its hard to find ways to bring exercise into my son's routine.  Its not like it was when I was growing up  when you'd head off on your bike in the morning for a day of active adventures.  I'm constantly scheduling activity and exercise into the day - to help keep weight under control and create healthy exercise habits - this video is a huge help.  Its a great way to get kids interested in yoga and in taking care of their bodies.  My son especially likes having the ""hip hop"" breaks .  He's looking forward to more videos like this.",1074988800,6,624,4.237288135593221
1968063,5,B00012FND6,My two year old twin boys loved this video.  They really enjoyed the catchy music and colorful scenes.  They also enjoyed pointing out different animals and watching other children doing yoga poses.  From start to finish they were captivated by this video.,1073865600,4,256,5.0476190476190474
1968082,1,B00012FND6,"I read the reviews and purchased this DVD, hoping that it would keep my 5-year-old daughter actively engaged.  I was looking for a DVD to put on while I was cooking dinner that would keep her moving, rather than just staring at the TV screen.  I put it on for her once, but I didn't pay much attention to it while it was on.  Weeks went by and she didn't ask to watch it again.  So the second time we watched it together, and I soon came to understand why she hadn't asked to watch it again.  Yes, it does show a few simple, kid-friendly yoga poses.  But in between the poses, there are stupid and weird story lines.  All told, there are probably about 5 minutes worth of poses in this whole DVD.  The rest is nonsensical filler.  If you're looking for a DVD to get your child moving and keep him/her engaged for 30 minutes so that you can cook dinner in peace, look elsewhere!",1121558400,5,877,4.203592814371257
1968083,1,B00012FND6,"then by all means, please buy this video.  If you want to reinforce that handwashing is important, buy this video (there is a very random handwashing lesson inserted among the break dancing).  If you love yoga, and want to share this love with your children, go somewhere else.",1120780800,3,277,4.75
1968084,5,B00012FND6,"My nine year old daughter is mesmerized by this video, immediately got up and started doing the poses, is doing it over and over, the only thing I have ever seen her interesting in is Hip hop and balance ball, but this fascinates her. I recommend it,it is very weird, for us adults, but the kids love it, She seems more relaxed already!",1120089600,,336,4.349206349206349
1968085,5,B00012FND6,"They actually request it.  My older son tries to do the poses, while my younger son just watches it, fascinated.  One of the best kids excersize DVD's I have seen.  I can't wait until the next one.",1115078400,5,197,4.27027027027027
1968086,5,B00012FND6,"Truly original and hip material. I love the music. You may be singing the lyrics all day after watching this video. The program is delivered in such a way that my kids responded immediately. My five year old daughter shouted, ""I can do that!,"" and began to try the postures.

",1111968000,,276,4.5
1968087,5,B00012FND6,"This is the cutest and weirdest thing I have seen. My two year old daughter is OBSESSED. At first she wanted to do the tape with her mother, now she performs it on her own.

Highly recommended.",1111968000,2,193,4.216216216216216
1968088,5,B00012FND6,"I bought this video for my kids. They love it ! They keep watching it over and over again ! It's fun, very educationnal and entertaining. Well done !",1111622400,,149,4.172413793103448
1968089,5,B00012FND6,"My daughter calls to me when she spots an Animal Yoga Break on PBS. I did some research on the program, and after reading a couple of reviews, I decided to order the DVD for her. In the one week we have owned it, I think she has watched the DVD 50 times trying to master the poses. It is great to see her so excited about physical movement.",1106870400,7,340,3.9420289855072466
1968090,2,B00012FND6,I have a small home daycare and thought this would be great to get the kids up and moving during the long cold winter.  Well they range in age from 4 1/2 to 2 and they all hate it.  It's not that long and no children were left even looking at it by the time it ended.  There were too many weird interuptions and not enough movement and following along.  I would not recommned this at all.,1106524800,6,388,4.0
1968091,2,B00012FND6,"This is a poor introduction to yoga.  On the plus side, my daughter seems engaged by some of it, and it does encourage movement and teaches some fun poses, but it is way too fast-paced and busy, with constant silly interruptions.  The story line is practically non-sensical.  I am amazed that it even claims on the package to be appropriate for children with ADH.  I am not an ADH expert, but, this video is unfocused.  The music is a bit raucous and irritating.  I was also hoping for more real footage of African animals, but there is hardly any.  Overall, disappointing!",1106092800,16,573,4.6138613861386135
1968102,5,B00012FND6,"I love this video.  I'm not the only one, my son is continually asking for it to be played; not just once, but over and over again. It's a great way for him to get up and move, unlike most every other video you can buy. He is only 2 and has already started to learn Yoga. He anticipates each new part of the video and moves along with the music and the poses.  The music is so groovy, I can't seem to get it out of my own head.  I'm caught singing at my job all the time.  I love that it is up to date and can keep the attention of children of many ages.",1103673600,4,554,3.7094017094017095
1968103,5,B00012FND6,My two boys are hoping for a sequel so they can learn more animal poses.,1102032000,,72,3.8666666666666667
1968104,5,B00012FND6,"Whenever we go anywhere, a Sponge Bob and an Animal Yoga DVD must come with my 3 yr. old son. He won't leave home without them. 

We were in a restaurant the other day when he performed the breakdance move he learned from this video. Sometimes, I'll notice that he will try a yoga position to occupy himself while I am cooking in the kitchen or busy on the phone. He is definately learning valuable skills from watching the yoga video.

When is the next Animal YogaDVD coming out?",1101686400,3,480,4.370786516853933
1968105,5,B00012FND6,"I saw one clip on PBS and I said ""Wow,""- I had to order it.

We have had the video for a couple of months. Whenmy daughterdoesn't watch it she still practices yoga moves. When is the next one coming out?",1101686400,5,203,3.951219512195122
1968106,5,B00012FND6,"I am a first-grade teacher, and I logged on to Amazon to write a review for this video as I have used it in my classroomsuccessfully. Iwas surprised to seethe German review, so I feel obligated to respond as I disagree with it. The content in Animal Yoga is not a traditional yoga class that a parent might expect. However, it gets kidsinvolved immediately, and it is Magic. Kidslearn very differently than adults, and as a teacher, I know that thefirst thing you must do is gainchildren attention if you want to teach them anything. This video does just that. It is original, and innovative, and kids love it. Highly recommended. Good use of your money, my studentsrequest this video everyday. Thank you Animal Yoga for being a positive educational tool in my classroom!

",1101686400,5,773,4.7611940298507465
1968107,5,B00012FND6,"I agree there was not alot of yoga and they are not held for long but the fact that it got out 9 and 7 year old boys INTERESTED, they  can practice the moves anytime they want!  The great 80's hip hop is so entertaining and colorful tht it keeps their attention, we are planing on getting fingerless gloves and headbands and layer out clothes to really get into it.  We homeschool and this was a great intro for the school year to get them moving!  We use it as a morning warm up and its great, the kids are talking about how they want to learn hoe to breakdance and walk on their hands, at this age with all those insanely crazy cartoons at least this one was BENIFITIAL as well as fun!

By the way ALL my kids loved this 3 boys ages 4 7 and 9 and a girl who is 5!  I highly recommend it if you have kids that wouldnt ever think of doing yoga.....they may just LOVE this video!",1099612800,6,878,3.9885714285714284
1968108,1,B00012FND6,"I bought this DVD based on the three raving reviews it had.  Well, I really cannot understand how it got them, and I rather have to agree with the negative one.  There is hardly any yoga in this video.  It is all rather goofy, with constant interruptions of the yoga poses (which are held for VERY short periods of time) by hip hop and break dance numbers - presumably to ""ligthen up""?  The kids found it entertaining, but as for making them feel ""peaceful and relaxed"" as yoga is supposed to - you can forget about that with this one.  Even the final ""relaxation pose"" is held for just about 3 seconds and then interrupted by more goofy cartoons of animals bouncing up and down.  Complete waste of my money.",1099440000,8,708,4.407692307692308
1968109,5,B00012FND6,I bought this a few weeks ago and had it sent to my almost 4 year old niece.  My sister says that she loves it!  She does it 3-4 times a day and does it well!  It is easy to follow and she laughs a lot throughout the workout.  My sister is also thrilled because my neice gets up in the mornings and goes straight to the DVD player and puts her yoga in instead of waking up her parents!,1095120000,5,385,3.775
1968110,5,B00012FND6,I used this video with my primary children in public school.  The children LOVED it.  They looked forward to doing it over a period of months.  Some parents purchased the video for their children at home.  Highly recommend!!,1094083200,8,224,4.815789473684211
1968111,5,B00012FND6,"My daughters were running to the mailbox every day to see if this DVD had arrived, and once we received it we were not disappointed!  The interactive format is fun for those who haven't ever tried yoga as well as kids who are a little more experienced.  My girls especially loved seeing other children practice the poses.  The benefits of this great new DVD are that children of all ages learn how to do different yoga poses in a safe, easy format that's a ton of fun!  I wholeheartedly recommend ""Animal Yoga for Kids"" and we're anxiously awaiting the next one!",1093219200,7,562,4.534653465346534
8005598,1,B00012FND6,"This is a really terrible video.  My daughter wanted to do yoga, not stand around and watch a 1970s meets the year 2009 cross-over acid trip.  Seriously, 15 minutes into the video, they had introduced 2 poses, TOPS.  Really...almost no exercise happening during this video.  It is like a really bad, home-made video that a couple of kids put together for a school project.  We also have the Gaiam Kids YOGAKIDS ABC's.  She loves that one, and we were hoping for more of the same.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!",1246492800,,500,4.67816091954023
8005599,1,B00012FND6,"This dvd was a dissappointment.  There are lots of gimmicks, strange adults trying too hard, kids doing break dance and other non-yoga related moves.  Basically there is minimal yoga, the format is all over the place, it's not fun or easy to follow.",1178928000,,249,4.767441860465116
8005600,5,B00012FND6,"It is Yoga meets hip hop meets the 60's.  Lots of fun and my daughter who is just under two loves it.  She does her best to do the poses and really enjoys the bright colors.  My husband and I get a real kick out of it and it brings back some interesting memories for us. However, if you are looking for serious yoga this is not the video for you.  It is just way more fun than that.

If you want a video that gets your child started with yoga that is lots of fun and not too serious this is the one for you.  My only complaint is it is just too short.  I want more.",1147996800,2,565,3.73728813559322
8005601,1,B00012FND6,"My kids love this video. My 4 yr old asks for it and my 2 yr old watches it. I find it bizzare and I frustrated by the wierdness ""become the animals"", ""words of power"", ""if you will it- it will happen"", ""chant Home"". The boys seem to like the girls though so I allow them to watch. Don't buy this for your kids though if you are looking for a exercise video.",1143158400,2,358,3.9178082191780823
8005602,1,B00012FND6,"I really hated this video.  I thought it might have interesting animals or African landscapes or something, but it's just goofy.  It's geared more towards people who would like Bratz dolls - intellectual parents will not like this video.  I gave it away at a yard sale.",1142812800,3,269,4.680851063829787
8005603,1,B00012FND6,"This is the worst kids video I've ever seen, the acting is awful, the rapping is criminal & they have no understanding of yoga postures, kids or how to teach to kids.",1138838400,5,166,4.21875
8005604,5,B00012FND6,"We love this dvd. My 1.5 yr old daughter received it as a gift. While I am not that into yoga, we both have a great time with it. My daughter loves to point out the animals on the screen, as well as dance to the great music. I like that it's a little crazy and off the beaten track, and over all very light-hearted - very much like my daughter!",1133740800,,344,3.859154929577465
8005605,2,B00012FND6,"This was a waste of time and money.  If it had come with a money back guarantee, I would demand it now.  This was really bad.",1127433600,5,125,3.769230769230769
8005606,5,B00012FND6,"After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy the dvd, but took a chance anyways and am so glad I did.  It's clear that the negative reviews come from a misunderstanding of what the dvd is supposed to accomplish: education while entertaining.  I bought the program for my cousins (two male and one female ranging in age from 3-8) and they really love it.  They learn a variety of yoga poses (and other life lessons) and the ""faster"" pace keeps them engaged and doesn't overextend their patience or their bodies.  They like it because it's hip and I like it because it engages them in an alternative way.  BUY IT, your kids might not be master yogis but they'll be calmer, happier, and see the world a little bit differently.",1124582400,4,735,4.496240601503759
8005607,5,B00012FND6,"When is the next one coming out? My nephews love playing along with this video. They insist on watching it over and over. It is educational and fun, and I enjoy the soundtrack as well! As a holistic healthcare provider, I find videos such as these extremely important to introduce early on to help with childhood development. Set up positive routines for stress management and relaxation. Plus keep your kids active and burning calories. Highly recommended.",1124496000,2,457,5.026315789473684
