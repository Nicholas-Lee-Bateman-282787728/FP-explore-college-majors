8115431,4,B000EXDRN0,"Weird, nonsensical mix of an ancient unfinished film and modern filler footage that in no way matches - not without its charm though",1437609600,,132,4.782608695652174
8115432,1,B000EXDRN0,"The moment I witnessed the opening credits of this disaster, I knew I was in for an epic disappointment.  Everything about this flick is terrible:  Story line, actors, filming, production, editing, music... Everything.  This movie is dated as having been shot in 1992, yet it looks as though it was actually made in 1972, on a two-dollar budget.

The ""story"" behind this mess is this:  A man gets in a car accident on his wedding night, resulting in the death of his wife.  He falls into such profound mourning that he attempts suicide.  Due to his suicide attempt, he is sent to the local sanitarium, where he is kept doped up on drugs that make him vulnerable to suggestion.  The viewer learns that this sanitarium is actually a slavery operation owned by two evil doctors.  The new male patient's job is to go out in the town and capture young ladies.  When the ladies are brought back to the sanitarium, they are promptly drugged and ""retrained.""  Thereafter, they are sold to a Middle Eastern sheik for his harem.  During all this, we have a parallel plotline where our hero, the male patient, discovers that the sanitarium doctors have imprisoned Marilyn Monroe for all this time- and amazingly, she hasn't aged!  Perhaps Marilyn is a vampire!  No... the viewer is not that lucky.  Instead, the actress has been given a script that makes Marilyn out to be the most vapid, childish, naive, and stupid woman to ever stain humanity- which is insulting primarily because Marilyn Monroe was actually extremely intelligent.

Perhaps there is a director out there who could have taken this story and made something redeemable- campy, or even a ""cult-classic"".  Perhaps there is a director out there who could have coaxed a spark of brilliance from each of the unfortunates who landed a role in this film.  Instead, what this story got was a ""production team"" that consisted of a bunch of retarded chimpanzees who escaped their handlers and swiped a bunch of cheap video recorders from a Radio Shack.  Even the score to this flick sounds like it was banged out on a Fisher Price keyboard that was designed for pre-school age children.  In fact, I believe that a gaggle of toddlers could have created a better accompaniment.  Hell, they could have created a better movie...

This movie is so terrible that if a burgler stole my entire DVD collection, he would actually break back into my house to return this one!

If Marilyn Monroe were alive today, she would sue everybody associated with this travesty.",1183334400,5,2502,4.794392523364486
8115433,4,B000EXDRN0,Could it be true?  Could Marilyn Monroe's death been faked?  Could she be in a mental institution locked away to silence her?  The acting in this film varies. Some performances are very good (John Phillip Law) some are mediocore.  But it is worth viewing.  I'm glad I own it.  The ending is so touching in a light hearted way.,1169510400,,326,4.440677966101695
