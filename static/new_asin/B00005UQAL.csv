1669732,1,B00005UQAL,"We owned a couple of very good Rock N' Roll DVD's (""Colors, Shapes and Counting"" and ""Phonics"") prior to buying this one.  However, I am very disappointed in the Spanish DVD.  It was boring to me and I am not sure I will ever show it to my son, who is a toddler.  What a waste of money.",1204070400,,286,3.896551724137931
1669733,1,B00005UQAL,"I bought this DVD a few months back... and honestly I can barely force myslef to finish watching it. Its Boring! There is no context for the Spanish that is taught. They throw out vocabulary and these phrases with no context to this cheesy rock music! If I, as an adult, am bored... I know my kids will be too! Too much translation goes on... there is no actual dialogue throughout the video.... which makes this video useless in my Spanish classroom. Worse still.... I wanted to use the colors part of the DVD for my 2nd graders... but honestly, the lady's skirt was too short. In short... take your money and buy another DVD; something that puts Spanish in an authentic text... with catchier songs!",1198195200,7,700,4.563492063492063
1669734,5,B00005UQAL,This is a great video!  I am a Spanish teacher and my kids love to watch this.  It is probably the most unique Spanish visual aid out there.  If you teach Spanish you should add this to your collection!,1196812800,,202,4.128205128205129

1669737,5,B00005UQAL,"It's fun.  It's easy.  It teaches a lot.  I love it.  I own quite a few learning videos, including Chinese and Spanish.  None is better than this one.  They should do it in other languages as well.",1144627200,26,197,4.1891891891891895
1669738,5,B00005UQAL,"About two hours of words, phrases and sentences. Rather intense, but extremely useful and is done in an entertaining way of rock songs. My three-year old can sing the color song, count to 20, point to his facial features and body parts, tells the weather, ask for ""el pan""...

We are very serious about learning Spanish. So we own Learn Spanish with Carlos and Chiquitita; the Travel Linguist; Hola Amigos; the Standard Deviants. All these are good for different things. But we love Rock 'N Learn the best!

For lack of better words, it crams in the most vocabulary in the shortest period of time and still somehow made it very easy and fun. I think the upbeat songs and dances really helped.",1132617600,83,692,4.617886178861789

The graphics are really cheesy--think 1970's disco--and the music sounds like every synthesized excercise class you've ever seen on TV.  There's very little ""Rock"" in this video.  However, the ""Learn"" is there, if you can get past the cheddar.  The vocabulary is good...basics from numbers to ""pass the carrots"" and ""please be quiet"" is covered.  This would be a good introduction or review for middle school or high school students.  The video is not really geared for younger children and can become boring.  My 3 year old will watch it for a while--especially the number portion...but then she (and I) get bored and attention wanders.  The graphics are repetitive and the music can be soporific.",1029024000,9,777,4.923076923076923
1669740,4,B00005UQAL,"I have this video and my children age 2 and 6 both watch it.  I find that it starts out pretty simple with teaching names of body parts, colors and numbers and then gets harder by teaching whole sentences.  Everything that is said in English is repeated in Spanish.  Ex: If they say, ""Let me teach you a trick"", they will repeat D&eacute;jame ense&ntilde;arte un truco.  I find the latter part of the video helpful only if you already know some Spanish. It is good to have on hand and I find that it keeps the kids' attention with all the dancing and music.",1021248000,12,557,4.326923076923077

There is a CD version with the same songs, and you can buy the CD (not DVD) and book combo on the company's web site.  I couldn't find this product on Amazon.  I encourage the company to package the books with the DVD.  I would pay extra to have had the books with the DVD.  I like using the books while I watch the DVD.",1495843200,3,388,3.923076923076923

1669750,5,B00005UQAL,"I am fluent in English. Spanish is not reinforced at home which is the reason I decided to purchase this dvd for my 5 year old daughter. She loves it.

The dvd is fun and engaging. The rhythm of the songs keep her entertained and eager to learn. Since she is only 5 years old, once the lessons escalate to advance words both in English and Spanish it loses her attention.
Overall, the dvd is great. The small words such as ""Hello, Good Morning, Colors and Numbers"" are words she practice repeating with the dvd. She than recite the words back to my husband and I. Once the lesson pick up the pace with larger words in English and Spanish, I know that part of the dvd is too advance. She will learn how to pronounce the words as she gets older.

I recommend this dvd.",1480550400,4,766,4.239726027397261

1669761,2,B00005UQAL,"Let me save everyone some money. I'm a 31 year old who's desperately trying to learn Spanish. I saw a few clips on YouTube. This DVD definitely had potential. It has A LOT of helpful information (and the female presenter is so freaking hot). However, the background music is so annoying. It detracts from the actual lesson (Wouldn't salsa music make more sense)? And to make matters worse, the background graphics are borderline nauseating.

Don't waste your money",1478563200,,464,4.948717948717949

1669766,3,B00005UQAL,"This DVD is fair at best.  I think the content is good and but the sound quality is not.  To me, it's important to be able to hear the pronunciation clearly in order to learn the words.

1669767,1,B00005UQAL,"I bought this for my elementary Spanish classes.  I wanted cute catchy tunes for students to learn vocabulary.  These aren't really songs, they are just people saying English and Spanish numbers set to music.  If you are a parent or a non Spanish speaker these could be helpful to teach Spanish, but as s Spanish teacher, I really wanted songs, not vocabulary spoken to music.",1473724800,,376,4.753846153846154

My kids were sick of it after only a few minutes. It doesn't hold their attention long enough to keep them watching to learn anything. It's just a woman singing spanish words and then english words.",1389139200,,335,4.333333333333333
1669805,4,B00005UQAL,It's fun and engaging. However it's very fast paced.  It teaches too much too fast.  You have to watch it over and over in order to memorize it.,1389052800,,144,4.107142857142857
1669806,5,B00005UQAL,"While the graphics are not the most sophisticated, I do like the way they present the information. The first day we got the video and played it for my 4-year-old she insisted we play it over and over and over again. She has picked up phrases very quickly and is responding in Spanish. We speak a bit of both in the household and thought this would be a good way to introduce phrases. Some of the phrases toward the middle to the end are difficult and it is funny to see the characters try to match them to the music but at young ages their minds are sponges and every little bit helps.  I would definitely recommend it.",1388361600,,619,4.245762711864407

1669808,4,B00005UQAL,"Its good but not great. What I liked and my kids like about it was the music. Its has the correct pronunciation and its teaches basic thing like colors, body parts and greeting. Overall i would get it because you have to get your kids to start off learning the basic anyways before you teach they be able to go to the next level. But I gave it a 4 star because it went too fast for the kids. They move on very quickly in the movie.",1380672000,,431,3.9655172413793105

1669815,5,B00005UQAL,"This title is volumes I and II on one DVD, and it's about an hour long. It's probably not a good choice for the youngest kids, it's a step above Sesame Street level because of the fast speed at which words are taught. I agree with the 'age 6 & up' age rating on the cover. It's better suited to slightly older kids up to adults who are new to Spanish, because the content is presented quickly. I have do a lot of pausing and rewinding to absorb the information. This is my only gripe.

How it works: Individual words or full sentences are given in English, then Spanish. And then for practice, you are given similar sentences in English which you are to repeat in Spanish. A moment later, the correct answer is given. You'll probably have to repeat the lessons (or whole video) several times before you get most of the content learned decently well.

This video is similar in concept to flash cards or a phrase book, but much more stimulating...it's rich in colors and sound, which helps with memorization. Some words and sentences are presented by actors or singers and sung to the beat of fun rock-pop music. Others are demonstrated via animations that are cute but not overly childish.

This video isn't nearly enough to get you speaking Spanish fluently, but it's a great introduction to get your feet wet. After, you might want to buy some Spanish flash cards or a phrase book, and an English-Spanish dictionary.",1348531200,2,1417,4.592885375494071

1669820,4,B00005UQAL,"I own several Spanish instructional dvd's for children and I feel this is the best overall.  It covers a very broad range of useful words and phrases.  I have found that it is easy to recall what is learned in a song.  Some sentences may seem odd at first, but a sentence such as 'I have a black cat' is useful for teaching ""I have....""  Once one knows that phrase, it is easy to mix it with other words to form new sentences.  More than once I have pulled a phrase from one of the songs out of my brain and used it appropriately.  The video is not high tech--I joked to a friend that it must have been put together the week after computer animation was invented. It also has one lady (out of four actors) whose clothing is a tad skimpy---not terrible, but it just seems unnecessary and out of place.  I wouldn't recommend watching the entire show in one sitting. It would be better to concentrate on a few songs at a time, master them, and move on.  My boys and I are now using the Rosetta Stone program (it's the best) and found that we knew a fair amount of words inlcuded in the first level because of what we learned from Rock N Learn.",1316476800,2,1140,4.17351598173516

My kids are now ages 11, 9, 6, and 3. The older two mostly imitate and make fun of the songs now, however they pronounce the phrases perfectly and they know the meanings.

My boys ask for it often and have certainly gained an enthusiasm for learning Spanish from this DVD, but as a teaching aid, it will probably fall short.",1264291200,2,371,4.723076923076923
1669827,4,B00005UQAL,"This video has good graphics but I wouldnt recommend it if you are prone to headaches or seizures.

The songs are good...well a few at least like the color one or the alphabet one.

It teaches a lot like time and weather and alphabet and colors and some descriptive words and seasons and question words etc etc.

It isn't the most exciting...but it is way better than Habla Espanol.",1250035200,,382,4.507246376811594
1669828,4,B00005UQAL,"You might be confused by all the reviews here and the extreme range of tastes. Try to overlook the extremes and you'll find what this DVD is really like. Personally, I mostly agree with the recent review by Jennifer Bogart.

The disc is often very fast-paced, but I didn't find that to be a problem because I don't think the producers intended for viewers to learn all this content in a single viewing. We all learn language (whether our first language or others) through repetition, so I expect to be seeing this disc repeatedly with our young student, soaking up a bit more each time.

The material is presented bilingually, so one should easily connect corresponding English and Spanish words and phrases. This is done both in the songs and the onscreen text, which means you do not need a book to go with it. As others have noted, it does seem that this might be almost as useful for people who are learning English as a second language, as it is for English-speaking people who want to learn Spanish.

I do not understand, and do not agree with, reviewers who complain about phrases in the disc being ""peculiar"" or that material is presented without context. And it is completely wrong to say that there is no ""dialogue"" in the program. On the contrary, in sections there will be one person asking a question and another person providing a context-appropriate response (like the obvious ""how are you"" and ""fine, thank you"").

What may throw some viewers off is that the people doing the talking aren't presented in some kind of fictional setting for a casual chat. Instead, they talk primarily to the camera, while their dialogue is translated onscreen, and the ""conversation"" is achieved by intercutting between the actors. Since you are trying to learn the words, I think this works fine.

The music is peppy, not Grammy quality but certainly not objectionable. I have no idea why the producers felt compelled to put in all those silly colored backgrounds, but they really don't bother me (or the grade-schooler who is the primary audience here). They detract from the professionalism somewhat but I do not think they interfere with the learning, which is all I care about.

One reviewer complained about the actress's skirt being too short. Sheesh. Trust me, she looks fine. Nothing that the kids haven't seen on TV -- or in regular life. Mostly she stands out on this DVD because the guys are mostly schlumpy-looking, but let's not hold that against her (or the guys for that matter). Pay attention to the language lessons and you'll be fine.

I also agree with Ms. Bogart that one might want to view this program in short segments rather than all at once. But in any case I'm sure we'll be viewing this one repeatedly and getting a pretty good foundation to connect with other learning activities.",1248652800,19,2807,4.739754098360656
1669829,5,B00005UQAL,"This is the best video I have found to help my children learn Spanish.  The songs are catchy and the graphics keep their attention.  No other videos we have tried compare to this one.  There is a lot of content, from basic words to advanced phrases.  This is definitely our favorite, and I highly recommend it especially if you are just starting out.",1245542400,,350,4.507936507936508
1669830,3,B00005UQAL,"Here in Canada the status quo second language of choice for elementary school instruction is French. With two official languages, French seems to be the natural choice for Canadians, but with only Quebec, France and a few other small countries utilizing it as a first language it seems wise to study a more widely used modern tongue. After picking up a few words and phrases from Dora the Explorer my daughter was confidently exclaiming, ""I know Spanish!"" It was most certainly time to bring in some further instruction. With Spanish spoken widely in South America, Central America, Spain and by minority groups in North America it seemed an excellent language to pursue.

The DVD version of Rock `N Learn - Spanish Volumes I & II contains the 26 lessons found in their original audio CD/book combinations Spanish Volume I and Spanish Volume II presented in a highly visual DVD format. While not presenting a full course in Spanish, the disc teaches Spanish vocabulary and basic phrases through song, rhythmic speech, colourful visuals and cheerful performers. The content is similar to the phrases and vocabulary typically learned in a first year foreign language course including: greetings, numbers, alphabet, colours, school vocabulary, calendar, seasons, useful questions, directions etc.

Native English speakers to the side of the screen against a colourful background say a word or phrase in English, which appears in print on the screen beside them. After a pause in which the student can fill in the answer in Spanish, a native Spanish speaker supplies the Spanish answer. For the more complex phrases video clips are shown, or computer graphics are supplied along with the English and Spanish text being spoken.

At 55 minutes in length, the disc is best viewed in short sessions. Picking a lesson or two to view several times in a row seems to work best for retention and maintaining interest levels. Attempting to view all of the lessons at once becomes somewhat droning towards the end. Because the lessons proceed at a fairly rapid pace, it takes a few viewings to become familiar enough with the terms to join in the fun. The excellent menu navigational tools offer a pictorial preview of each lesson in the scene selection feature, making it easy to focus in on specific groups of vocabulary words.

Some of the sentences are very complex, and aren't necessarily intended to be memorized in Spanish, but rather provide a translation of an English explanation on the DVD itself. Others do not seem to be commonly used, but rather provide reinforcement and some exposure to Spanish sentence structure. Parents of children with visual sensitivities or attention difficulties may want to pass on this disc, as the background colours behind the performers often include, swirling psychedelic patterns. These aren't too offensive when monochromatic (only blue for example), but when they include blue, yellow, pink etc. and the computer graphic character is wearing red, it can be quite overwhelming visually. These over the top, continually present, backdrops are my main pet peeve with the disc, the other being female performers dressed more provocatively than one would expect in a children's educational DVD.

That being said, the songs and even rhythmic speaking to background music has proven to be highly infectious in our home. Before bed I often find myself singing some of the songs with my children, and they run through my head continually. There's obviously some learning going on here. Spanish Volumes I & II is a fun and easy way to reinforce first-year Spanish lessons or pick up some simple vocabulary before taking a trip.

I would have rated the disc higher if it weren't for the backgrounds!",1245283200,13,3723,5.065252854812398
1669831,5,B00005UQAL,"I taught Espanol in the school. The quality of the dvd does not correspond to my taste, I could not understand why kids loved it so much, but they did and sang the songs with delight. I give this dvd 5 stars because  the kids learn Spanish in an easy and funny way, and they retain the vocabulary.",1225152000,,297,4.120689655172414
1669832,3,B00005UQAL,"Some facts about this DVD

1. Volumes I & II are both on one DVD
2. There are 26 sections, for a total running time of 55 minutes
3. It's a useful revision tool for beginners learning Spanish
4. Some sections are more helpful than others

This DVD is useful for helping students to remember basics such as the parts of the body, numbers, colors, the alphabet, and simple phrases.  The music is catchy, and the pronunciations are clear. The actresses are pretty attention grabbing also.

In some of the other sections however, they rattle off the most peculiar phrases that you'll never, ever remember or need to know, and we often just skip over these.  I also think that they go a little too fast sometimes, but at least you can listen to the correct pronunciation of the words.

We generally just show the section relevant to what the child is doing in school to complement his class work, and reinforce what he's learned.

7955869,1,B00005UQAL,"If you've been like me where you've been looking for a Spanish DVD to help your toddler then you know the struggle of finding anything out there that will captivate and teach. I really was trying to find something with the Spanish alphabet and I was so excited when it said it taught it. I literally opened the package and popped the DVD in while  my whole family was on the couch waiting. Never have I been so embarrassed. It was this back and forth conversation between adults with this cheesy music on the background. While I get the concept with the different conversations, this is not easy to get through. It is so hard to stay awake or to start engaged with. It's beyond boring, unless you're like me and love to just critique the people and their horrible acting. Like others said, the women on  here are a little phony with their thought outfits and somewhat sensual air when they talk and pose and what not.
  I wish there was a way to return this overpriced DVD but I feel bad cause i took off all the wrapping.
  Honestly the only way I can see anyone watching it is in segments... A minute or 2 per day cause all at once... I would fall asleep. It's such a boring DVD.",1519948800,,1181,4.297297297297297

It did not capture my 7 year old's attention (we have been trying periodically since he was 5) and he didn't learn as much as he did with the Whistlefritz videos.
