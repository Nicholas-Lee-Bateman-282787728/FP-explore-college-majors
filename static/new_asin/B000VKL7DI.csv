2942361,5,B000VKL7DI,"This DVD is a reminder of how great TV used to be. Three of the best singers of all time together and just for kicks add Vic Damone and Henry Mancini.  Now we have reality TV showing talentless people whose only claim to fame is that they are on a reality show.

Buy this DVD and listen to some amazing music.  I miss variety shows like this one.",1356912000,,346,4.0588235294117645
2942362,5,B000VKL7DI,We love Andy Williams. I grew up with his shows and they bring back so many fond memories of sitting around the tv with my family.,1356566400,,130,4.038461538461538
2942363,5,B000VKL7DI,Dvd contains originally aired programs from 1966 and 1968.  Cast includes Roy Rogers and Dale Evans; Smothers Brothers; Cass Elliot and others.  Andy sings his signature song Moon River. Great part of the collections.,1350172800,,217,5.352941176470588
2942364,5,B000VKL7DI,Must have for Andy Williams Fans. I just wish it was long or more of them!,1258848000,2,74,3.6875
2942365,2,B000VKL7DI,"First, I am a big Andy Williams fan, and saw about all of his shows in the 60's and 70's and own almost all of his music.  I remember this episode well and it was great ---- it was a special of 5 or 6 shows he did in the late 60's before returning each week in 1970.

The problem is whoever put this show together, as well as ALL of Andy's Time Life DVD's chopped it (them)up so badly you can barely recognize them at times.  I would bet that most people bought these Time Life DVD's mostly to see Andy Williams sing his 3-4 songs per show, secondly to hear him sing with his guests, and thirdly to see his guests.  In any of these DVD's, you MAY get to hear Andy sing 2 songs in total.  In a couple of these Time Life DVD's, his guests sing the final song on the cut versions.  Definitely not what I bought it for.

Time Life should not have butchered these episodes as they did.  I was really looking forward to them but I was very disappointed.  I'd love to see them reissued in their entirety (without commercials) which would end up being 45-50 minutes each.  Now THAT would be worth buying.",1226966400,21,1096,4.127358490566038
2942366,3,B000VKL7DI,"As a teenager who listened mostly to the pop stars of the day back in the 60's (like the Beatles, Supremes, Young Rascals, etc.), I must say that there was something about The Andy Williams Show that made me want to tune
in every week along with my parents.  The voice, of course, cannot be denied, but Andy had such an easygoing charm and self-effacing sense of humor that I found him very appealing.  I really did get a kick out of his show, and it stands as one of the better musical variety shows from an era when there were a LOT of variety shows.
I looked forward to this DVD, having purchased another ""Best Of"" DVD of his show about 5 years ago.  From the back cover info I expected two complete episodes, or at least something close to it.  The guests are all wonderful, but it is way too edited.  Out of an 80 minute running time, only about 52 minutes is the actual show.  The rest is a recent interview with Andy.  I wouldn't even have minded an edited version had it not been so heavy-handed.  In an introduction to the first episode, the present-day
Andy talks about a wonderful duet he did with Ella Fitzgerald.  That duet is NOT on the DVD!  And then his opening number has so obviously been cut out of the show, only to have him mention who his guest stars are TWICE IN A ROW!  Who butchered this thing?  Once I got past the crazy hatchet job done on the episodes I did enjoy it.  The guest stars are all wonderful, and were all at the top of their respective games, whether it's
Ella smoldering through ""Lover Man"" or the Smothers Brothers doing their patented schtick.  There's a wonderfully silly duet with Andy and Cass Elliot, and a fabulous medley of Burt Bacharach songs done with Burt leading the orchestra.  But why do we have Andy singing ""Strangers In The Night"" instead of one of his own hits?  It's just another example of the randomness of this DVD.  But you cannot fault the performers.  They're all wonderful.  I just wish more care had been put into this release.",1208995200,11,1996,4.375
2942367,3,B000VKL7DI,"I wasn't expecting much more than just what the title suggested: ""Best of"" clips of various shows.

But ""best of"" doesn't mean ""after this commercial break"" and various other incidental material from Andy's shows.

However, this was mostly a good, albeit brief, time capsule of two shows and an extensive, interesting interview with Andy.

There were two highlights on this DVD: Ella Fitzgerald singing ""Lover Man"", a performance that was stunningly perfect, and the medley featuring a youthful Burt Bacharach (Andy's introduction for Burt bordered on weird, in my opinion).

The medley with Cass Elliot was flat out cute and fun (what a loss that she died so young). Cass and Andy appeared to have had a blast doing this act, judging from their chemistry.

All in all, this is a respectable DVD, but as others have said, it didn't contain enough musical numbers, and the editing left much to be desired.",1199664000,19,904,4.921052631578948
2942368,3,B000VKL7DI,"I did enjoy this DVD. Excellent musical numbers with Ray Charles, Cass Elliot, and of course Andy. There was also a good comedy routine
with Jonathn Winters.

But the shows are incomplete. Sceens have been cut out.
I can only assume it may have been for music rights.
Which too bad because I love to see entire episodes.

I like the interview with Andy. I found it be very informative.",1195430400,20,385,4.485714285714286

2942411,2,B000VKL7DI,Gave this as a xmas gift to an Andy Williams fan. They said there was more talking than singing and would have preferred the opposite. They were a little dissapointed but decided to keep it anyway.,1388880000,3,197,4.5
2942412,4,B000VKL7DI,The celebrities shown on the cover are there and they are super.  A little disappointed in Bob Newhart's comedy and he is usually terrific. This only covers two of his shows of 11 years work. He sings a lot and is always top notch.,1372464000,,231,4.25
2942413,5,B000VKL7DI,This item was just as described and it arrived on time.  The show was wonderful.  I would recommend it highly.,1366156800,,110,4.45
2942414,4,B000VKL7DI,"It's great to have this classic slice of American showbiz at home, each segment preserved here in wonderful, rich color videotape from as early as 1962. Also, the sound quality is very good, which says a lot about the excellence of the professional equipment they were using at the time and the care lavished on the show by the crew. The image is somewhat grainy, but it shows remarkably little of its age when you consider this material is now about 50 years old. Also, it's good to see the disc is region-free, making it available to customers over the world.

The selection kicks off marvelously with an uninterrupted sequence showcasing the versatile talents of Andy Williams, The New Christy Minstrels, and especially Sammy Davis Jr., presenting his singing, dancing and vocal mimicry in the best possible light. This is followed, among other things, by Bill Cosby's great 'street football' comedy monologue, presented here in full (he was one of the few guests who was allowed to completely improvise and run overtime), and a wonderfully deadpan clockwork pantomime starring Sid Caesar, in which Andy suddenly manages to look a dead ringer for Buster Keaton.

There are also stunning vocal tours de force from Righteous Brother Bobby Hatfield in his classic ""Unchained Melody"" and Ella Fitzgerald in her freely improvised rendition of ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", fine laid-back duets and banter with Bing Crosby on ""In a Little Spanish Town"" and ""Don't Fence Me In"", and stellar singing from Julie Andrews with Andy and The Osmond Brothers. In her case, though, it's a pity we're missing out on the equally great duet with Andy on ""Our Language of Love"" from the same show, and a surprisingly raucous, thrilling turn on ... a rhythm 'n blues medley with Ray Charles' ""Hallelujah I Love Her So"" as lead-in and cue.

This omission points to some serious flaws in the format, as scene choices often become patchy with erratic edits and interrupted sketches. It's certainly nice to see the NBC peacock logo in its full glory once or twice, but do we need to have this type of introduction over and over again in a 'best of' selection, along with random end credit sequences and even Kraft cheese sponsor logos?

Also on the minus side, how can lengthy footage of Andy's co-star Sandra Dee modeling various luxurious costumes for their joint movie appearance in ""I'd Rather Be Rich"" be considered part of the best segments of Andy's shows? Why on earth is Andy shown singing only a few lines from his standard closing song ""May Each Day"", when full versions are also available from his shows? And why is Tennessee Ernie Ford likewise only singing a small part of his massive hit ""Sixteen Tons"", when both listings suggest these are complete performances? There are a number of odd cuts like this, and remarkably few solo vocal turns from Andy, which must be his most lasting legacy, along with his great duets with guests.

On the whole, a fine selection to have, but some very questionable choices and sloppy editing.",1363132800,6,3014,4.856031128404669
