5944821,5,B00EUNHIJ4,"This video on lifting is presented very professionally. It is indexed so you could find the subject of interest fast for review. Tips are very practical and the concepts build on each of the exercises. You can see that the basics apply to all movements being barbell, dumbbells or kettlebells.
