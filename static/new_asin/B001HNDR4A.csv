3641212,3,B001HNDR4A,"I enjoyed these interesting tales based on supposedly true events.  A couple of stand out episodes, but most are pretty tame.  The biggest plus is that Boris Karloff plays a different type of character in every episode.  Comes in a nice tin box and the price is right.",1403654400,,268,4.541666666666667
3641213,5,B001HNDR4A,"I happened to find a couple of these episodes on one of my Roku channels. I had no idea they even existed! Loved the episodes so I looked on Amazon to see if they were in DVD's and happily I found out they are! Excellent show, wish there were more.",1395446400,,248,3.98
3641214,4,B001HNDR4A,"I like this type of movie, but there is not enough suspense and action in this collection.  But I do recommend it for Boris Karloff fans.",1393891200,,137,4.269230769230769
3641215,3,B001HNDR4A,One of the episodes skips so unable to watch.  I do like the episodes I was able to view.  Regards.,1392508800,,99,3.9
3641216,2,B001HNDR4A,"Yes, it was cheap, but I expected more from Boris. I watched the first disk and then got bored. I am going to give this away rather than throw it in the trash.",1386115200,,159,3.8484848484848486
3641217,4,B001HNDR4A,it has great suspence and drama and it's introduced by boris karloff the expert on tales of unusual stories and tales,1384992000,,117,4.619047619047619
3641218,5,B001HNDR4A,"Another good one by the ole pro Boris. This show is along the lines of One Step Beyond.
If your a Karloff fan or like 50's mystery type shows, I would say this is a definite choice to buy.
Too bad it was only one season. Apparently this show was first aired in the early 90's and only once. The first and only airing also was missing one episode. This collection has all 14 or 15 episodes.
I think no serious Boris Karloff collector could pass on this gem.

PS: I believe Boris Karloff is in every episode but one.",1381190400,,514,4.14
3641219,5,B001HNDR4A,"This was a gift I bought for my Mom, and it was just liked. The fact that this was rather obscure made it more in demand.
Boris Karloff was in most of the different horror vignettes, and it was just the perfect gift.
It arrived on time in a beautifully packaged nostalgic looking tin, containing 2 dvds with so much on them, my mom could watch for have the day, and was completely happily satisfied!",1377216000,,399,4.333333333333333
3641220,4,B001HNDR4A,It a  bunch of movies put together well clean and reminds me of the good old days. You can't go wrong buying this.,1376611200,,114,3.9565217391304346
3641221,5,B001HNDR4A,I love Boris Karloff. This series is good entertainment for late cold evenings. I can watch these anytime I want to and not worry about setting my VCR.,1363910400,,151,4.428571428571429
3641222,5,B001HNDR4A,"It's 12 midnight on a Friday evening....This is the time to watch ""Tales of the Unexplained""...These superb, thought provoking episodes are in black and white,which lend to the mysterious nature. The legendary Boris Karloff not only is your host but also has roles in each episode. The introduction to each episode starts of  with Mr Karloff in front of a blazing fireplace....the setting a very old style castle-like living room. This is enough to put you into the right mood....then the show starts!......If you have an open mind and love black and white classic television.....then this is for you!!I have been enjoying this compilation...Enjoy!!",1358640000,,649,5.240384615384615
3641223,4,B001HNDR4A,"Tales of the Unexplained-From Behind the Veil makes a nice addition to your Boris Karloff collection. I am a big Karloff fan and among my collection is Frankenstein ( of course ), The Mask of Fu Manchu, The Mummy, the Mr. Wong Detective series, the Black Cat and The Terror. Filmed in the United Kingdom and produced by Hal Roach Studios, you enter a huge castle room complete with a roaring fire; Mr. Karloff rises from his reading chair and welcomes you to the particular night's episode. Each episode deals with encounters with the unknown... an apparition, strange macabre twists of fate, precognition and similar unexplained phenomenon. Filmed in the late 50's and never released on television, the episodes were quite haunting and atmospheric, with Karloff starring in most of them as a sea captain, doctor, lawyer, police constable and so forth. The shows have a suspenseful tone along with good acting and you have a what-comes-next anticipation as you watch the next episode. The twelve episodes ( yes,twelve! on a two-disc set ) are of excellent recording quality and will be very enjoyable for fans to watch the master of the horror genre in his element.",1308096000,,1165,4.918781725888325
3641224,4,B001HNDR4A,"Not a lot to say about this series. The stories are predictable and pedestrian, but the casts are game and give good performances (many well-known character actors pop up frequently.) The directing is competent and the production values surprisingly good. The most fun is watching old pro Karloff mug his way through most of the episodes, sporting an amazing variety of wigs! ""A"" for effort, and the quality of the picture and sound is amazing. If you are a Karloff fan, you will want this for your collection. If you are a fan of the paranormal genre, it's not a bad addition to your library at this price, but it ain't no ""One Step Beyond,"" believe me.",1270252800,,654,4.598290598290598
3641225,2,B001HNDR4A,"I like this series even though it tends to be a bit simple and low budget. Most previous and current DVD releases are all under the title ""The Veil"" and for some reason? they have retitled it which muddies the waters on what it is. It sounds like this release may have a slight amount of additional material but I am not sure. Just type in the search box - ""The Veil"" and you will see the other releases of the smae material. - Steve",1246320000,,433,4.105882352941176
3641226,5,B001HNDR4A,"I think these are all a series of really cool supernatural stories, starring & hosted by Boris Karloff. He always plays something in each tale. These are fun to watch when you are in the mood to watch some low budget supernatural made for TV stories. I like the gritty black and white photography as it has a certain feel that color cant match. The 2 dvds are in this really cool tin. I think Karloff completists would want this and fans of Karloff should give this a try. It is inexpensive so why not.
If you liked Karloff's worst films, you'll have a good time watching these back to back with some popcorn and an unlit room.",1245542400,,627,4.322033898305085
3641227,5,B001HNDR4A,"Karloff is a very good actor. This set shows his talent, and he's not always the 'bad' guy.",1243641600,,91,4.111111111111111
8309190,5,B001HNDR4A,I had an older version of this that was quite good but this on is actually complete. The audio and video are excellent. I would have preferred that both discs were in the same case but keeping them in the metal box does not take up much extra space. The price is very reasonable and that is always a plus.,1510963200,,305,4.1
8309191,5,B001HNDR4A,"A true treat for vintage TV aficionados.  Maybe not so much a treat for the TV fan who is accoustomed to modern production values.  It's in B&W and the stories would probably bore younger viewers.  The plots deal more with unexplained and unusual events rather than terror and gore.  This is the set to purchase as it contains all 12 episodes that were produced.  Many other sets I have run across have only 10 episodes.  Take note that the first episode, ""The Vestris"", is from a Bell Telephone anthology TV show called Telephone Time and does not feature Karloff as the host although he does appear in the episode.  I can only assume that the Telephone Time copy of ""The Vestris"" is the only surviving copy of the episode.  There are 12 shows on 2 discs and each of the discs are in their own DVD package and everything is in an embossed metal tin.  My order shipped fast and arrived in great condition.  A great value!  Speaking of value...if you are looking for Karloff's ""Thriller"" TV series shop around!!  The exact same set here on Amazon at around $200 (new) is available on another major website for under $40.  Go figure!",1494979200,,1131,4.53960396039604
8309192,5,B001HNDR4A,very good,1471564800,,9,4.0
8309193,5,B001HNDR4A,"My only complaint is that I so wish there had been more episodes made, but every one of these 12 stories is a gem. Yes I know it says 10 but I bought the version with ""special bonus, the unofficial pilot of ""The Veil,"" entitled ""The Vestris"" (which aired on Telephone Time) and a previously unavailable episode ""Peggy""
This was so much better than twilight zone or any of the more popular anthologies. The stories were well written and creepy as heck for their day, and do stand up to the test of time. If you appreciate chills without the excessive blood and gore of todays shows you will love this.",1463184000,,600,4.414414414414415
8309194,5,B001HNDR4A,Great collection of Boris Karloff!,1446940800,,34,6.0
8309195,5,B001HNDR4A,Great collector's item.,1443484800,,23,7.0
8309196,5,B001HNDR4A,Excellent  good quality,1437177600,,23,6.666666666666667
8309197,5,B001HNDR4A,As a fan of old tv shows I had never heard of this show probably because it was never broadcast due to the studios bankruptcy.  It is WELL worth the money and includes all episodes.  The episodes are very well produced and mostly in great condition considering the age of these films.  If you're a fan of Hitchcock or twilight zone or night gallery you will love this set.,1435536000,,372,4.36231884057971
8309198,5,B001HNDR4A,"Boris never disappoints. My lady friend and I like watching all the stories ""behind the Veil"". Especially since the DVD is in black and white.",1432512000,,142,4.72
8309199,5,B001HNDR4A,"Saw these stories on Prime and loved them so I had to have them to watch again.
The are soft Twilight Zone shows that make a person think.",1429056000,,138,3.9642857142857144
