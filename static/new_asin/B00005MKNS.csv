7945721,2,B00005MKNS,"Only in case these late 50s (it should be 1958 instead 1968 as listed above) TV-episodes can evoke some personal memories in you, is this DVD worth viewing. Unfortunately I have to describe it, together with some other DVDs from this lot, incredibly boring. Looks poor Boris was in bad need of money, he looks so uninspired.
