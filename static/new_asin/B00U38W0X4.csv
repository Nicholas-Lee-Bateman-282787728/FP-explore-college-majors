I am always sad to see the real life passing of each and every one of them.  They have made me chuckle for many, many years and I have no doubts that they will continue to do so, even while watching my DVDs over again.",1433894400,10,366,4.126760563380282

7028918,5,B00U38W0X4,"This is a BBC comedy about life in an English village.  The DVD is exactly what BBC America is showing on PBS now.  It's funny and interesting.
Last of the Summer Wine actually started in the 1970's and has endured for 31 seasons.  I'm really glad I could get these
DVD's through Amazon.",1458259200,,287,4.377358490566038

7028934,5,B00U38W0X4,Really like LOTSW series.  The disc arrived packaged good & played good also.  Just wish all the series years were already out now.  I just don't know why they take years to come out over here in the USA on dvds when the last episode was broadcast in 2010 in Britain.,1439769600,,267,4.196078431372549
7028935,3,B00U38W0X4,"This group is good, but it's not the same without Foggy and Compo. Even the Howard/Marina dynamic has lost some of its sparkle--but of course, haven't we all! :-)",1439164800,,162,4.620689655172414

7028938,5,B00U38W0X4,This is a British Program that I like.  I can only see the episodes from previous years.  The only issue I have is that the DVD is formatted for British DVD Players.  I bought me one of those players.  It was only $45.  It plays movies from different regions around the world.  It would be a lot easier to just use one format for the whole world.,1438473600,,346,4.08955223880597

7028946,5,B00U38W0X4,I don't think there will ever be a television series that I absolutely adore as I have this one. This particular set from 2004 is great. I can't say enough good things about them. I watch and re-watch them with much pleasure. They always make me laugh. The actors are fabulous. The scenery is glorious and the story lines are always extremely entertaining. This is the best of the best of the best. I love Last of the Summer Wine.

7028949,5,B00U38W0X4,Never quite the same without Compo but the reason I first noticed the show was because of Frank Thornton.  When they went back to older episodes I was not sure about it but decided to watch a second show and by then it was love.  This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  So I am glad I got the series even after losing Bill Owens as there is no other show like it out there.,1436400000,6,382,3.810126582278481

7028955,5,B00U38W0X4,"As someone who has every other LOTSW DVD I can tell you that this is another one that carries on the high standard of the others of the series. Peter Sallis is, to my mind, one of the most underrated actors of the last 50 years. More than a comedy, this show evokes a feeling that cannot be gained from any other show. Brilliant.",1434585600,4,329,4.15625
