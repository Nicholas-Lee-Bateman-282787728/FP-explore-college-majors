4662194,5,B005DUNX1K,"I'm very happy to finally get this. I was afraid Amazon will not get anymore copies. This a very funny show and I love the comedic voice acting. If you or some geeky friend of yours watch cartoons, I recommended this cult classic.

4662196,4,B005DUNX1K,"The transfer quality is nice, and all of the episodes are here.  That's likely the best any EWJ fans are going to get, so I've probably won you over with that.  Unfortunately there are no special features whatsoever on these discs.  That's a little disappointing as even the old VHS releases of two episodes each had a short production feature.  Including those four segments on here would seem to be an easy add-on.  Really though, the main draw are the funny, eclectic episodes of this unique series, so it's not a big lose.",1354579200,22,526,4.612903225806452

4662198,4,B005DUNX1K,"Yes, the region 1 version does exist!  The case looked stepped on and at least one of the discs is scratched but that is just a hazard of buying anything through the mail. There really isn't much to say about this set. It has no extras whatsoever. The picture quality seems okay. It is NOT a bootleg and says NBC Universal on the cover and on each disc. It is a three disc set in an typical plastic case. The case is a good one, this one just has damage. There are 23 episodes which we think is all of them. There are 7 or 8 episodes on each disc. It should please any North American Earthworm Jim fan.",1351296000,16,602,4.0588235294117645
4662199,5,B005DUNX1K,We have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for years. We were missing one of the VHS tapes that my son got when he was 8 years old. Now that he is 21 and in college he is so thankful to have them all on one DVD. He packs it with him for school every year!,1350432000,,261,3.440677966101695
4662200,5,B005DUNX1K,"I fell in love with Earthworm Jim when I played the first game, so when I found out that EWJ was getting an animated series, my mind was blown. I loved the cartoon. It had everything; action, comedy, adventure, great characters and villains. I taped them all, so I have the two seasons on tape. However, as everyone knows, tapes don't last long. The tape containing the first season wore off, and the other is going down the same path. To remedy this, I have been hoping for a DVD release of the series. Boy was I happy when I found out about this box set, and was waiting for release day so I can get a copy. But now its unavailable...I guess not enough people knew about it.

This really needs to be released. Share this page with friends and anyone that grew up playing and watching EWJ. Let us show the company releasing this that there are many fans out there that want Jim to return. It doesn't matter how long it takes, as long as the DVD set is released!",1343520000,8,962,4.256830601092896

4662202,3,B005DUNX1K,"I'm not a fan of Earthworm Jim (though it is starting to gain my interest), but know many out there are and I know how much you've waited for the series to finally hit US DVD, but there is a catch:

[...]

""If you've ever pre-ordered any title, then be certain to pre-order this one, as the State-side distributor for VEI, called Millennium Media Services (MMS...which *used* to be part of First Look Pictures, but isn't any longer, but that's why Amazon's listing currently shows ""First Look"" as the studio) has a policy that if there aren't enough copies of a title pre-sold to retailers, then MMS won't bother to ship the title to ANY of the sellers who ordered it. This is why so many VEI titles tend to get delayed, or even cancelled, in the USA. We know that our previous story about Earthworm Jim - The Complete Series had a HUGE amount of interest, so hopefully that turns into pre-orders, meaning that everybody can actually get their copies.""

So if you're one of the millions of Earthworm Jim fans out there, make sure you pre-order your copy today and spread the word to make this set a reality. And remember to stay groovy!",1334275200,25,1136,4.504854368932039

However... the audio track has a subtle beeping sound that is annoying. It seems some sort of audio queue or perhaps a phone outside the remastering studio. Irritating. It occurred on the first two episodes so I don't know if it is on all episodes are discs.",1484611200,,440,4.365853658536586

4662224,3,B005DUNX1K,"I remember watching this when it first aired but the WB however left Longview for while so I never got to watch the second season.  Until I bought this DVD collection and to my annoyance the second season wasn't anything to brag about.  It was okay but that's as high as I can go.  I mean its like the people who made the show didn't know a second season was greenlighted until the last and minute and threw the whole season together like Rocko, Heffer and Filbert did with that Wacky Deli cartoon.  There is no real thought any where in the second season.  Not to mention one of the biggest problem that the show has is all the original good guy characters except for Mrs. Bleverage are only good in the episodes they debut in.  After that they suck.  The original bad guy characters are good and stay good.  The first season is good but the second season is just barely okay.  Watch it and you'll see what I mean.",1473897600,3,915,4.304093567251462

4662238,4,B005DUNX1K,"I had only recently found out that this collection was a thing, after wondering for years when it would get one.

Does it hold up since the last time I watched it? Yeah, I think so, especially considering the wacky, near-Animaniacs style of comedy still works in the context of the show. The animation's about what one would expect for a Saturday-morning cartoon, so make of that what you will.

The only downside is that the neat little behind-the-scenes bits from the original VHS releases are nowhere to be found. As a collection goes, this is pretty basic. But hey, if you just want to watch a silly cartoon from an era before video games became ""SERIOUS BUSINESS"", you can do much worse.",1454976000,,692,4.617886178861789
4662239,3,B005DUNX1K,"I remember watching this show in college and laughing my butt off.  Earthworm Jim is based on the video game for the Sega Genesis, the leading game console at the time.  (Or the Super NES, if you were one of *those* people...)  The cartoon perfectly captured the absurdist nature of the game:  Jim is an ordinary worm who was given super-powers when a super suit fell out of the sky and landed on him, and he uses its power to fight space villains like Psy-Crow, Bob the Killer Goldfish and Professor Monkey-For-A-Head.

Dan Castellaneta, best known for his work on The Simpsons, provides the voice of Jim, and he's hilarious.  Jim's sidekick, Peter Puppy, quotes Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" (""I must not fear, fear is the mind killer..."") and turns into a monster and attacks Jim whenever he gets injured or frightened.  In fact, there are quite a few literary and film references sprinkled throughout, and most of them are classics or modern classics so they don't feel dated 20 years later.  I caught nods to Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction, 1984, original series Trek and many others.  It's fun, inspired lunacy, with Doug Langdale as the head writer - more recently, he created ""Dave the Barbarian"" for Disney Channel - although the animation is lower-end 1990s quality.  As a result, while the writing and voice acting are solid, the visual comic timing frequently feels a bit off.  It's a notch or two below its Warner Bros contemporaries, ""Animaniacs"" and ""Freakazoid"".

Unfortunately the 1990s were also a time of censorship, as parents' groups' concerns over video game content (darn you Mortal Kombat) spilled over onto television shows.  The episode ""The Book of Doom"" originally had Jim saying the line, ""Aww, screw the universe, I want my book back!""  On subsequent broadcasts, this was changed to ""To heck with the universe.""  There was also one scene where Evil the Cat got taken to the vet to get ""fixed"" and this was changed to ""shots"".  Alas the lines included on this DVD set are the censored ones.

The only other downside is the DVD presentation itself.  It's bare-bones, with the only ""special features"" being the ubiquitous Interactive Menus.  The audio and video quality is good, although I did encounter one glitch in the episode ""Evil in Love"" where the scene froze and skipped a few times.  I swapped it out for another copy and had the exact same problem with the replacement, so there must have been a problem with the entire production run.  Hence the three-star rating.

And with that, I'll close out my review before a cow inexplicably falls out of the sky and lands on someone.  (Watch the show and you'll understand.)",1454284800,7,2642,4.8093126385809315

4662242,5,B005DUNX1K,"I didn't watch this show growing up but watched a few episodes on YouTube years ago and thought it was hilarious. It reminded me of Animaniacs and Freakazoid and a lot of other cartoons I actually did watch when I was younger. Earthworm Jim starred Dan castellneta(Homer Simpson) as the title character and ran from 1995-1996 on Kids Wb and was based on the video game by Doug tenapel.

Overall this is a great cartoon and I'm happy to won it on DVD. If your a fan of the games I would highly recommend this because it's one of the few video game to cartoon adaptations to actually be as enjoyable as the source material.",1451779200,,621,4.4

Ridiculously funny stories.  I'm surprised that FREAKAZOID made it on DVD before EARTHWORM JIM.  One of the best animated comedies aired back in the 90s.  One of the best cartoons to air on the WB.

4662287,5,B005DUNX1K,"I never thought I'd see this come into reality. Earthworm Jim was an animated series that ran for two seasons from 1995-1996 on Kid's WB TV. It's based on the surreal humor video game for Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. The cartoon was unlike any other animated show. The show constantly breaks the fourth wall, which they do it in a way that is original.

Every episode leaves you laughing every second. There is not a dull moment in this series and that is something that most cartoons these days are lacking.

If you think that an extraterrestrial super suit that fell from space and landed on an earthworm then granted him super powers is funny and freaking awesome, then prepare to place an order.

Finally, the complete series of Earthworm Jim is here on dvd. The product is truly the best Earthworm Jim as ever looked. All 23 episodes of the series are here spread over three discs. There are no special features, but who cares? We finally have Earthworm Jim in complete series form.

The video and audio quality is the best Earthworm Jim as ever held. And now this dvd set is at a price that is unbeatable.

So log on to your amazon account and place an order for Earthworm Jim: The Complete Series. You will enjoy every second of this amazing animated series.",1405468800,4,1269,4.548245614035087

4662289,5,B005DUNX1K,Earthworm Jim deserves more credit than it got in the past. I can see them remaking this for adult swim and making it a bit more grown because some of the jokes on this show were for adults to get lol. This brought back memories and even 15+ years later I'm still loving this cartoon.,1389484800,,284,4.181818181818182
4662290,3,B005DUNX1K,"Such a classic show based on a great and extremely challenging videogame series!  This series has many memorable characters such as Peter Puppy, Queen Slug for a Butt, and of course Jim himself.  All the episodes are here, which is great, but they definitely haven't been retouched at all since their original run.

This is one of the poorest retro releases I have ever seen, worse than any Cookie Jar release to date (even C.O.P.S.).  Universal has COMPLETELY dropped the ball on this one.  The episodes have that classic tv blurriness, nothing serious but I have come to expect more from the DVD releases of my childhood favorites (see ReBoot, She-Ra, and Transformers for some amazing remastering).  The absolute biggest disappointment has to be the way this was thrown together.  The packaging is 100% bland, which is surprising considering what a ridiculous (in a good way) show Earthworm Jim was.  The case is clear plastic, yet inside of the case is just plain white, no episode list, no artwork..... just the crisp white back of the cover slip.  To continue our theme of ultra-boredom the on-screen menus are a single motionless picture of Jim, with the only options being ""Play All"" and ""Episodes"".

So in summary, the show itself was hilarious, this release however is nothing more than a rushed, effortless release aimed to capitalize on nostalgia...... and unfortunately if you were a fan of the show like I was, this is the only place to get it.",1377907200,3,1458,4.842741935483871

4662292,5,B005DUNX1K,"I love this show. I already got two other complete Kids' WB shows on DVD (Freakazoid and Pinky and the Brain), one more wouldn't make a difference, unless that one more show happens to be EarthWorm Jim!

I saw this at a lower price, but I missed that opportunity. There were higher prices, but I would NEVER buy it at about five thousand bucks. That's why I bought it at a decent price. As for the delivery, I totally wasn't expecting it to arrive on Monday, let alone on a Tuesday; Fast and worth it.

The content of the set's okay, too. I don't even care about a lack of special features, because not many people would care about it. The show itself is great, right down to the falling cow. I heartily recommend this show to anyone with half a mind to watch anything, or anyone with a taste for comedic violence.",1373328000,,814,4.313725490196078
4662293,5,B005DUNX1K,"The Earthworm Jim cartoon was one-of-a-kind, and it is wonderful to be able to own the complete set. Not only does our somewhat naive but good-hearted annelid super hero stand out among the crowd of super heroes, he inhabits a totally zany and often hilarious world. A world where the lead evil scientist somehow ended up with a monkey growing out of his head, where a goldfish customarily plots planetary domination with the oratory style of a televangelist, where the furry sidekick copes with stress by turning into a monster and attacking our hero... can you think of any other fictional worlds anything like that???

The one annoying thing about this dvd is that the menu was done rather carelessly -- some of the episode titles got switched.

One other fact of interest for many Earthworm Jim fans is that the creators have finally gotten back together on another project, a new video game called ""Armikrog"". At the moment Armikrog has an open crowdfunding campaign in order to get enough funding to finish the project. If you're interested, try googling around to find the page for pre-orders or maybe even the finished game (depending on how much later you're reading this review).",1370217600,2,1189,4.881188118811881

I have only watched one episode so far, but it takes me back. Enjoying the classic 90's humor and animation. Glad I was able to scoop this one up for retail price, as everywhere else online is selling it for A LOT MORE. Grab it while you can!",1365984000,,541,4.356435643564357

4662296,4,B005DUNX1K,"I was waiting for this classic TV series to hit DVD sooner or later, but as it is, it took its sweet time  Compared to shows such as The Super Mario Bros Super Show, Legend of Zelda, Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, Street Fighter: The Animated Series (GI Joe style), and Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, which were awful.  This show, Street Fighter II V, and the old series of Pokmon is a great animated series for being based of a video-game.  The only reason I gave it 4 out 5 stars are facts that there no special features and some of the episodes are not played correctly when selected I'll cover that later.  Other than that, if you love the Earthworm Jim games, you'll love this brilliant animated series based off the video-game series.",1363305600,,771,4.485714285714286
4662297,5,B005DUNX1K,"When I found out Earthworm Jim was out on DVD, I had to have it. One of the things that makes it awesome is that it stays true to the games, while having its own level of originality. The show has a great line up of voice actors (Jim Cummings, Charlie Alder, etc) and a diverse and weird rouges gallery of villains. EWJ is the perfect mix of action and comedy, with plenty of randomness thrown in. Despite, the novelty of Peter Puppy's ""transformations"" wearing off in Series 2, the episodes are still unique. This DVD was grrrroovy! Buy it!",1362096000,,541,4.42

4662299,4,B005DUNX1K,"I was a bit young when Earthworm Jim was actually airing on Kids' WB, but I do certainly remember the toyline and the general popularity of the franchise.  In watching most of these episodes for the first time, I have been relatively impressed at how legitimately funny they are.  EWJ is a lot like The Tick or Animaniacs, in that the humor is appropriate for kids but contains a lot of pop-culture references that only teens and adults would really appreciate.  Simply put, there's enough dry humor and sarcasm to make the episodes worth watching today, regardless of nostalgia.  Also, the voice acting is top-notch, especially Dan Castellaneta as Jim.

On the downside, the video/audio quality is mediocre (as some reviewers have noted), but clearly these were not taped off the air or anything like that.  Additionally, there are no special features, which is even weirder considering that the VHS tapes had behind-the-scenes clips regarding the making of the show.  On a final note, some of the episode titles in the menu are incorrectly flipped.

Also, I would like to add that I truly believe this set is NOT a bootleg--it is simply a lower-quality third-party distribution of a show that otherwise would never have made it onto DVD.  As fans of EWJ may know, the rights to the character are a mess, so we're lucky that this set even exists.",1359417600,11,1347,4.796536796536796

The problem with the DVD, for me, is that the quality is not the best.  It is obvious that there was no effort made to digitally enhance the existing animation.  My guess is that there weren't enough fans to warrant the expense, but I sure would have appreciated it.",1358899200,,457,4.033333333333333
4662302,4,B005DUNX1K,"Now I did not get this from Amazon but if you do a little searching you can find the website that makes and sells them and it comes from Toronto, Canada. It does play on PS3's and region 1 players but thats it. The product is what I would have expected, Its 3 dics with all the episodes in decent menu's but no special features. If your a hardcore Earthworm Jim fan like myself then this should be a no brainer for you to pick up finally. It's the best that the fans of the series are gonna get and I am very happy with the product. All togther since it ships from Canada is about $27-28 for it which I think is well worth having this show finally. The website I think VEI entertainment or something but if not just google things that have those names and I'm sure you will find it. So if you finally want this show you can get it with a little searching and paying a little more. Also the website is secure and shipping isn't too long but I would still recommend paying with Paypal just in case.
