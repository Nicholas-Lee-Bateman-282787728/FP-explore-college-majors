2922261,5,B000UJCAJK,"First off, the other reviewer is mistaken. He may have had a problem figuring out the DVD menu. This one DVD DOES contain a full JB concert w/ a very brief on stage guest appearance by a younger/pre-wierd Michael Jackson dancing the moonwalk etc...as well as a bonus BB King ""set"". I just look at it as a James Brown concert w/ BB king as a bonus option...THIS IS A GREAT DVD TO OWN and the hardest working man in show business doesn't disappoint. It could be longer. The production & stage could be better, but overall, it is the best JB DVD concert I own - great audio, great video and a great performance! I'm very happy with my purchase. Buy it!!!

  Personally, my favorite single JB performance/appearance on DVD would be a tie between the following two: the odd duet of a very humble JB & Pavarotti singing ""This Is a Man's World"" - their only song together on the Pavarotti Duets DVD (a must see!)or the JB performance on the T.A.M.I show DVD - classic!!! Although neither of those two DVD's are geared towards fans of soul..., it's worth buying them just to see a perfect JB and practically HighDef video w/ Pavarotti.  Btw, another JB DVD I own, The Night JB Saved Boston is a great performance and great historically, but the sound really is just aweful. I don't understand? It's such a shame! Because of the poor audio, it unfortunately should be reserved for only the biggest JB fans. Unlike the other DVD's I have mentioned, sadly the JB/Boston DVD will probably not find itself in my DVD player very often...",1287532800,10,1523,4.507246376811594
2922262,2,B000UJCAJK,I'm disappointed. I thought this DVD was a 2DVD set. The box states that also. The bonus DVD (James Brown) was not in the package. B.B. king did three songs then exited. What a waste of vinyl space.,1202601600,3,198,4.2368421052631575
2922263,5,B000UJCAJK,"For anyone who is and was a James Brown fan, this is the best.  JB at his best.  Dancing and singing are great. Even an appearance by Michael Jackson in his younger more normal days.  A little blues thrown in by BB King makes this DVD outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!",1201392000,9,257,4.425531914893617

8213526,5,B000UJCAJK,"The footage here is from an old HBO Special: James Brown and B.B. King Live at the Beverly 1983.  This formerly hard to find footage is incredible.  B.B. opens the show and then James takes over.  Then comes 20 minutes of the best R&B ever captured on film:  The Medley includes:  Good Foot, I Got that Feeling, and then Man's World. Michael Jackson joins in for one number with James and then a second medley starts with Hot Pants, Cold Sweat, Papa's Got a Brand New Band and Please, Please Don't Go.  The band is tight and the segues between tunes are incredible.  You can see it on youtube. Tune in from 31:30.",1399852800,,613,4.371681415929204
