The actors are so breathtakingly bad, they immediately make it clear how difficult good acting, writing, directly, and movie-making truly is. Holy crappola, this movie just stinks.",1323302400,16,331,5.264150943396227

Who are these people who enjoyed this tosh? Please don't waste your money, it doesn't even have the camp appeal some (bad) gay films have.  I will avoid any other film by this director and any film featuring these ""actors"" (I use this word advisably).  Life is too short to waste time on this ........",1431216000,,454,4.487804878048781

4933848,4,B0062QHZKY,"What a wonderfully cute and charming movie!  I first saw Benjamin Lutz in The Men Next Door, and was excited to find another gem like this that showcased his acting ability and charm and, let's face it, those amazingly handsome good looks.  It was nice to see him take the lead in this clever little comedy.  It is a welcome addition to my movie collection!",1424908800,,357,4.461538461538462

4933854,5,B0062QHZKY,"I'm glad I don't pay any attention to the other reviews, this was lots better than most said.  I was pleasantly surprised at the film.  Got this movie for Father's Day, they knew I wanted to see it, and told me not to buy the instant Video so I knew what was going on.  It was great.  Brad was a fox and Tim was a real cutie, come to think of it all the guys were cute.  Normally the Gay Indie low budget films are not super, but this one was very good.  I loved all the supporting characters, the script was acceptable and the outcome was great.  Give this one a try.  Highly recommended 5.0 stars 06242014.",1403568000,,608,4.093220338983051

4933859,5,B0062QHZKY,I loved the entire plotline and quirky characters!  I made me happy to see everything work out despite the horrible way in which things started.,1371772800,,144,4.76
4933860,3,B0062QHZKY,Benjamin Lutz adorable looks a little like the first Darren on Bewitched give a admirable performance as the love sick ad executive who is pining for his ex.  The movie is cute and has several funny moments but in has some marginal acting moments.  With that said this is ok view.  Enjoy?,1370563200,,288,4.5
4933861,1,B0062QHZKY,"The acting in this movie is pathetic. I mean really. The premise seemed quirky and the guys on the cover handsome, so I had high hopes. But the overacting from start to finish was nauseating. Granted, the script itself was awful. Benjamin Lutz in the lead role just made it worse. Does the guy study acting with Paris Hilton, or what? I actually think the guy snoozing on the cover has potential as an actor, but he's got nobody and nothing to work with. The reviewers that wrote how they loved this movie must be on crack or have their heads buried in one. Trust me, this movie sucks rope.",1369699200,,590,4.372727272727273
4933862,5,B0062QHZKY,"Gay romantic comedies should always be, in my ever so humble opinion, campy.  This film lives up to my expectation and then some.  Just a tad on the silly side, but with a great cast and fun plot line it has something for everyone.  WATCH IT!",1368748800,,242,4.217391304347826
4933863,4,B0062QHZKY,"This tells the story of Paul (Benjamin Lutz) he has lost his boyfriend through a breach of trust and can't get over it. So after more than a year (that is two in gay years for those not in the know) he decides to get his man back.

The problem is he works with his ex Brad (John Werskey) in an advertising company. Brad has moved on and is dating bi guy Ted (Jackson Palmer). He also does some social work at a local clinic run by his life long doctor friend Dr, Bert Halper. Whilst there he realises that if you are ill, people naturally let you get away with stuff and rally around. So you can guess what he does. He bribes his friend to invent that he has the `c' word yes crabs, sorry no cancer.

As word spreads he is soon inundated with well wishers which also includes his larger than life mother, millionaire, nymphomaniac, sister and the much desired Brad. As the deception piles up so does the stress and the humour levels.

Well this is a comedy and there are quite a few laughs but not enough to give you face ache. There is some nudity but nothing to make your auntie have to leave the room or to require that emergency Kleenex be on hand. Director Michael Simon has made a warm, human and moral tale that balances the gross lie with a human narrative that pulls you along for the journey rather than forcing it on you. Its just over an hour and a half long - which is about perfect for this type of tale. It won't change your life but it should put a smile on your face.",1364688000,2,1484,4.145833333333333
4933864,5,B0062QHZKY,I wasn't sure about this movie after reading some of the reviews but after viewing it I have to say it was very well done and was well worth the purchase.,1364169600,,154,4.0

4933867,5,B0062QHZKY,"This film is a lesson in love.  It shows all the faults, foils, and fallacies, that enter a relationship, especially when one of the recipients is immature in all facets of life.  This is a film whose message can be in straight relationships as well.  It is the universal message of love, true-love, which knows no boundries and or direction.  Man provides both guidance in his actions and behaviors.  It can be a very trying episode in ones life, but in the end, it is so very worth every heartache and sorrow that comes along.  You need to screen this film with the one you cherish and love.  It will make your own relationship even stronger.  LOVE HAS ITS OWN AGENDA AND MENU!  NJMJr.",1362873600,2,687,4.475806451612903

4933870,3,B0062QHZKY,"I don't particularly like the main character or the story in general.  However, it has decent acting, a few laugh-out-loud moments, good production quality, and a happy ending.  So, as far as gay romantic comedies go, I say this one makes it into the green (but not by much).",1359590400,5,275,4.591836734693878
4933871,3,B0062QHZKY,It is ok.  Some over acting.  But it is not terrible.  I have seen worse.  I am neutral on this movie.,1358812800,,102,3.7142857142857144
4933872,2,B0062QHZKY,The premise was not something I was comfortable with but decided to give the movie a chance. The actors struggled to keep a lame script alive.,1357776000,,142,4.5
4933873,5,B0062QHZKY,Pretty good movie. It was not the best movie I have seen. however i would watch it again. Sad that some one would go to the measures to get someone to love them again.,1357516800,,167,3.9411764705882355
4933874,2,B0062QHZKY,"I had no sympathy for the lead and the horrible things he did, so I could not laugh as if it were funny, or empathize with him. Don't Reccomend this movie,",1357171200,,155,4.032258064516129
4933875,2,B0062QHZKY,"It's been a few days since I rented this and I still can't get over how horrible it was on so many levels.  The plot is just dumb, for one...but in the days since I watched it I'm actually very disturbed by the fact that someone actually made a movie about a guy faking cancer to get attention.  I actually liked the main actor in another movie he's in (the one where he plays a guy who ends up dating a guy who is also dating his father).  That's why I took a chance on ""the love patient"".  Very few gay movies are ""good"" in the sense that they are well-made or well-written...but this is honestly the first movie in a while that I've seen that made me want to take a shower afterwards.

I still can't get over how horrible it was for this guy to fake having cancer and put people through the emotional terrorism of that.  And nobody really had that big of a problem with him doing this, which is disturbing.

I wish I had not watched this, but what was seen cannot be unseen at this point.",1356912000,3,991,4.130208333333333
4933876,3,B0062QHZKY,This was a cute movie! worth the rental but very unrealistic! If someone did this to me they would have my foot in their ass!,1356912000,5,125,4.04
4933877,4,B0062QHZKY,"If you're in the mood for fun, predictable, light, and frothy, go ahead and hit Amazon's one-click purchase feature.  This independent film is far better than most in the gay genre.  Still, it is the entertainment equivalent of cotton candy at the state fair.",1355961600,,259,4.863636363636363
4933878,1,B0062QHZKY,This movie is absolutely the most dissatisfying order I have made on Amazon. It is completely stereotyped down to the last character and probably some of the worst writing and acting I have ever seen. It's a wonder why people think homosexuals are all one-sided comedic people and are portrayed as such ludicrous characters. DO not watch this film unless you plan on being abhorrently insulted...,1353715200,3,396,5.015151515151516
4933879,3,B0062QHZKY,"Disappointed in yet another gay themed movie.  With Hollywood brimming with gay writers, directors, and actors, why do we still get 'less than' from gay movies.  The movie is built on a hoax of the most serious kind.  The only serious actor was the bf who left the lead and yet came back to him in the end.  YUCK.  Little entertainment.  Less annoying if you ignore the less than quality of the video, the less than acting, and the less than weak plot.",1346889600,,452,4.385542168674699
4933880,5,B0062QHZKY,"A delightful, light-hearted romantic comedy that's utterly enjoyable to watch with a somewhat cliche though heart-warming ending. A great-looking cast, especially the two attractive male leads, certainly helped in making this comedy both lovable and hilarious at the same time. I completely loved it and would certainly recommend it.",1345420800,,333,5.816326530612245
4933881,2,B0062QHZKY,"I did not like this movie. At all. I saw the trailer and I thought, ""Hm, this might be good."" I mean, it looked good. But, alas. The characters were believable, and I felt like I would've appreciated the story line more if I would've been reading it as a book instead of watching it. The actors, however, couldn't really act all. The main character, Paul, annoyed the hell out of me with that sarcastic smirk he wore throughout almost the entire movie. And (I might sound like a bit of a b-word here, but) I did not find any of the actors remotely attractive (except for maybe Ted)which is kind of important for me when trying to get into a movie. All in all, I couldn't really get into this.",1342828800,2,692,4.290076335877862
4933882,2,B0062QHZKY,"Script is trite but that isn't the worst part. The jump cuts, lighting, stiff, character acting and sloppy continutity doom this conceptually worthy storyline from the start. Even with the low budget, I expected at least an honest attempt to adhere to basic grammar of filmmaking. The director cared little for the craft of moviemaking and it shows. A hastily cranked-out job from start to finish.",1342742400,2,397,5.03030303030303
4933883,1,B0062QHZKY,"Sometimes bad acting can be forgiven when the movie has some redeeming qualities (like the 4 eating out movies).  The premise of Love patient sounded like it could be a funny movie, but right from the open it was just awful.  The actors had no chemistry, the acting was bad, the writing was bad.  There were almost no funny moments and it was a challenge just to watch it to the end.  I would steer clear of this garbage.",1337472000,2,421,4.291139240506329
4933884,3,B0062QHZKY,"I loved the concept, and let's be honest, most of all would do the same for love (or him, whatever works better for you). I think that the action happens too fast, so the story is not able to be told the way it was supposed to.

Good movie, you should watch it, but it will not define the rest of your life for sure.",1335225600,,316,3.8615384615384616
4933885,4,B0062QHZKY,"Hilarious, totally wacky and, despite prim naysayers here at Amazon and IMDB, quite wonderful. And Sweet -- and there ain't nowhere near enough of that going 'round. Bought it sight unseen 'cause it starred Ben Lutz, who (a) is drop dead gorgeous IMHO, and (b) unquestionably had the funniest line in the whole movie of  BITE MARKS (which I originally bought 'cause it had Windham Beacham in it).

Now, if some enterprising director would just put Ben Lutz and Barry Zito, the SF Giants' pitcher, in a romantic comedy together! (They look enough alike to be at least cousins.  So since I was not bothered by FROM BEGINNING TO END, I think that would be really neat, and hot -- and never mind Barry's baseball statistics!  I'd pay to see those two together as readily and happily as I go to AT&T Park to see Barry!!!!!

Enjoy this insane piece of fluff.  Madcap, zany, sweet and, in places, really, really funny.",1334966400,2,911,4.627329192546584
4933886,1,B0062QHZKY,"This was a horrible movie, that i can not believe I sat through, what a terribe basis to base a movie.  Lies and deception throughout this movie",1330819200,,144,4.333333333333333
4933887,1,B0062QHZKY,"While at times amusing, I was never able to get past the very offensive and stupid premise of this film, that someone ( a rather unlikable cad of a character )tries to get his boyfriend back ( whom he mistreated and cheated on, apparently ) by pretending he has a serious cancer. That he gets the help of his doctor by giving his clinic a big check is all the more disgusting. I felt sorry for the boyfriend, who seemed decent enough. Much of the writing and acting is very broad and not very good. Some of the characters are written as if they were cardboard cut-outs. A truly sick little film.",1330560000,5,595,4.321428571428571
4933888,5,B0062QHZKY,"I found the movie to be funny and filled with both sexy and talented actors. While the premise might be a little off, it doesn't negatively affect the movie itself. There are some sweet moments in the story as well as hilarious ones with the mother, who is a hoot. If you want to forget the troubles of the world for a bit, get this movie!",1329868800,,339,4.151515151515151
4933889,2,B0062QHZKY,"1. The whole idea of pretending having cancer to get your bf back (sick, especially for people, who experienced cancer in their families). Why not pretending being HIV+? That could be a ""nice"" story too:(
And the perfect bf who takes him back over and over again? Who in real world would be soooo naive and trust such egoist and mind-player again?
2. What is the message that the director put in the film? That cheating does pay off? That people without any morals are more likely to succeed? Or maybe the one that a lot of gay people are sociopath?
I know it was supposed to be just a comedy, but even then I expect something more from a motion picture than a few handsome bodies.
Anyway,
2. acting in 85% time of the film is really pathethic. The only parts I enjoyed were the characters of the old doc and the dumb Ted (playing not a bright person isn't all that difficult, is it?).
The rest of the cast members is wooden.
The only reason I highered my rating were the last 2 minutes of this film. A positive message that gays could also be foster parents.",1329782400,7,1059,4.326633165829146
4933890,4,B0062QHZKY,"I enjoyed watching this campy movie. It was hillarious. I chose this movie based on comedy, and I got it. The best part of the movie is when he realizes people are moving in, when he thought his secret was just kept that, a secret. Now he still has to pretend. The only character I did not get into is the friend's father. He looks to be around 110 yrs old, and no acting skills. Oh well, the movie itself was great.",1328659200,,416,4.085365853658536
4933891,4,B0062QHZKY,"Humor is so personal. I found this funny. The mystery of why the couple ""broke"" up engaging. Might even give it aa 4.5. NOT AN AMAZON OPTION. Need to watch again. Great nudity also. Clear visuals.",1328400000,,196,4.472222222222222
4933892,3,B0062QHZKY,"Yes, it is a bit corny, and flawed. Yes, it has a few minor weaknesses in the acting and in production. Yes, the story line is not even remotely realistic.

So what! It is a sweet, sexy love story that could have gone horribly wrong, given the subject matter. I mean, it is hard to make light of cancer and hard to make light of what the main character and his Doctor did, but if you suspend reality a bit and just go with it, you may just enjoy this film.  I certainly did.

It had its funny moments throughout, and the two main characters are easy on the eyes.

To really enjoy this story, just don't take it too seriously, don't expect too much from it, but sit back and fall in love with falling in love.  Do that and this movie is hit.  I personally loved it and laughed several times, and found myself smiling throughout.

Enjoy",1328227200,32,834,4.2075471698113205
4933893,5,B0062QHZKY,"Finally, a romantic comedy with a gay couple; bout time.  The dialogue was refreshing and funny.  The lead actors are handsome, and well, hot.

Not only was this fun to watch, I bet it was fun to write & fun to film, evident by the bloopers at the end. As for the naysayers - we all have opinions & I bet movies they like, I hate.

8491401,2,B0062QHZKY,"I'm surprised that there are good reviews of this film - I'm guessing the filmakers got all their friends to write positive reviews.  it's really, really bad. It almost pulls off a horrifying premise, but the main character's selfishness is so repugnant and his emotional terrorism so unforgivable, that there needed to be enormous consequences for him rather than everything working out smoothly in the end. You know that's not going to happen from the beginning due to the ""whacky"" tone, but still.

Speaking of whacky, the film was half-assed in it's outrageousness - it really needed to be more campy and over the top, and much darker and funnier. The acting is not great, but I suspect that's direction because I've seen some of these people in other films where they were more competent. The direction, cinematography, and editing were amateur. It was only the pretty faces (because we hardly got any body at all) that made this watchable.

In short, this was a risky concept sunk by a lack of commitment and competence.",1504310400,,1026,4.851428571428571
