8324709,4,B00006SKWR,"Both Kinji Fukasakus movie and Street of Shame by Kenji Mizoguchi deal with the same theme: the discussion about the legal abolition of prostitution in Japan in the years 1956-1958. While Mizoguchis movie backs sharply the abolition, Fukasakus movie is against it (e. g., its music is rather a glorification of the geisha trade). His work is a more or less objective analysis of the water trade (the house rules, its financial aspects, the girls, the clients, the mamasan, the patronage), in the same vein as the Japanese writer Nagai Kaf did in his novels and short stories.
Both movies explain clearly the social background and the causes of the choice of the girls to enter the water trade: poverty and family problems (ill health of family members).

Sayo Masuda (Autobiography of a geisha) as well as Arthur Golden (Memoirs of a geisha) confirm in their books that the important financial investment in the training of a girl to become a geisha is for a major part immediately recovered by the sale of her sexual initiation. This fact was completely forgotten in the movie Memoirs of a geisha by Rob Marshall based on Arthur Goldens novel.
Not a masterpiece, but well worth seeing.",1462060800,,1186,4.842364532019705
