8489343,4,B001CUB24K,"Having been in Easter Island in late 2008, I purchased this DVD in order to get another perspective and, of course, to enjoy again the fascinating scenery of this place.  The narrator does a solid job of laying out the theories concerning the moai and of raising questions that people have been trying to answer for years.  You have to admire this guy for going wherever the situation demands.  Of particular interest to me was the network of caves on the island, given that I did not have the opportunity to see them during my visit.  The program is relatively short in light of the complexity of the subject matter. Nevertheless, it presents a decent overview of the issues, particularly those dealing with the construction and movement of the moai and the ultimate failure of the civilization there.  Anything relative to Easter Island holds a certain fascination for me, and I hope that you find the same level of interest.",1231200000,10,927,4.76875
