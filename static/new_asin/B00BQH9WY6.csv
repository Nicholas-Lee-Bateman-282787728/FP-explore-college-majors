8572468,2,B00BQH9WY6,"Jeannette MacDonald may never have sung poorly in her life, and this performance was no exception. However, the lighting, black-white contrast and sets were so primitive and distracting.that viewing wasn't pleasant. Seems unfair to such a superb singer/actress near the end of her career. I'm not sorry I saw it, but I probably won't watch it again.",1475712000,2,349,5.140350877192983
8572469,5,B00BQH9WY6,"Jeannette is a joy at any time; a woman who can speak volumes with her face, and can sing beautifully. Great samples included.",1438041600,,126,4.521739130434782
8572470,1,B00BQH9WY6,"It was the worst DVD I ever have had. The picture was some what garbled and not clear. She sang only a few songs. Over all, it was terrible. I threw it in the trash. Wish I had the money back !!!!!!",1433376000,2,198,3.738095238095238
8572471,3,B00BQH9WY6,"The Voice of Firestone was an early musical program on NBC radio and television on Monday evenings. It featured Howard Barlow and the and the Firestone Orchestra and Chorus. There was a guest artist every week; these were usually opera singers. This particular program aired on November 13, 1950, and the guest was Jeanette MacDonald, who was a film star and outstanding lyric soprano. She starred in many motion pictures in the '30s and '40s, most popularly in eight operettas with Nelson Eddy. On this DVD, the video quality is that of 1950 black-and-white TV. If you are under 60, you'll see it as rather primitive. But the performances of the orchestra and Miss MacDonald leave nothing to be desired. At the time of this broadcast, she was 47 years old. She did not look like the Jeanette MacDonald who was voted ""Queen of Hollywood"" in 1939, bit for a 47-year-old woman in 1950, she was a knockout. Here figure was more mature than in 1939, but far from matronly, and her voice was, if anything, stronger than ever. For what it is, this is a very enjoyable DVD.",1392681600,4,1066,4.645502645502646
8572472,5,B00BQH9WY6,"As someone who was born after Jeanette MacDonald had passed, there was always a wish that I could have gone to one of her concerts. This was the closest that I could get to seeing her in concert and it was worth it. A beautiful lady who will never be forgotten.",1391990400,5,261,4.137254901960785
8572473,2,B00BQH9WY6,"What a disappointment.  Jeanette sings only three songs and none of them real favorites.  Yes, she appears lovely as ever and graceful but the show is dominated by the orchestra playing pieces.  Very little of substance from Jeanette.",1376006400,7,234,5.105263157894737
8572474,4,B00BQH9WY6,"This is a treat for fans of Jeanette MacDonald - her appearance on a 1950 ""Voice of Firestore"" television program. She is in fine form as she sings, dances and engages her audience with charm and grace. The lighting is uneven, and she is reported to have instructed the crew how and where to focus the lights, since she moves about the stage as she sings - unlike other performers who were more static. The entire program is great fun and representative of her film and stage career, but perhaps the most interesting is the ""Italian Street Song"" where one of the chorus boys tugs her arm as she moves away from him, jerking her. She responds by continuing the song and wagging her finger at him as she holds the final high note for an impossibly long time. MacDonald fans will be delighted to add this historical disc to their library.",1370563200,7,835,4.5
8572475,5,B00BQH9WY6,"When the Voice of Firestone programs were being released on videos, one of the last to be put out was the one and only appearance of diva Jeanette MacDonald. Other offerings contained 3 or 4 appearances by the specific star, and producers figured few would pay full price for just a single show. However, they risked it and Jeanette's one-performance video proved to be one of their best sellers. The entire show is a delight, especially the live aspect that finds a dancer accidentally jerking Jeanette in the wrong direction and her charmingly waggling her finger at him later in the song, ""naughty naughty."" Also, the lighting of the show was especially flattering to the 47-year-old singer. She arrived at the broadcast studio to find they were still using the harsh, primitive TV lighting that could make a teenager look haggard. She quickly phoned her husband, Gene Raymond, and he arrived to instruct technicians in more sophisticated Hollywood methods, allowing the beautiful Ms. MacDonald to glow. Subsequent singers on the show owed her a great debt for more flattering lighting.
The repertoire of songs is typical of the times, a mixture of sophistication and schmaltz. Jeanette comes off aces in both styles. A real joy.",1367280000,15,1232,5.014634146341463
