The performances alone make this movie exceptional, but it goes beyond that. An amazing reflection on loneliness, love, and personal exile. One of the greatest hidden diamonds I've ever found.",1499644800,,305,5.375
7802790,4,6300134954,"Actually a review by Ragsdale's husband, Jerry.  Purple Taxi is an outstanding movie, full of mood, atmosphere, ambience, plus some of the greatest Irish scenery.  The acting is superb by Ustinov, Noiret, Rampling, the actor who plays Rampling's brother, and Astaire.  Unusual story makes it even more mysterious and tantalizing.  A series of people from other lands living in Ireland trying to resolve their problems and rework their life situations are aided by the clever Irish taxi driver Astaire, who sees through them all.  Noiret also shows insight into the others' lives, while trying to resolve his own personal problems.  While all actors are great, Noiret is beyond great--a truly outstanding performance.  One of the best 25 movies I have ever seen in my 70-plus years!  the other reviewer was right--a neglected masterpiece.",1405555200,3,837,5.2406015037593985

7802792,5,6300134954,"If you are slightly cerebral, decadent and love the autumn color of Ireland and the personal stories based on the analisys of the subtle feelings instead of ""special effect"" and action, this is a film for you not to be missed.
I'm sure you'll love.
Great soundtrack and photography!
I consider it a neglected masterwork.
Enjoy!",1075161600,20,327,4.857142857142857
