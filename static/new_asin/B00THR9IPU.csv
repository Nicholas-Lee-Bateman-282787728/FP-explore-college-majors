8701783,5,B00THR9IPU,"Let me start by saying I had purchased a book by Wim on heavy bag training, and also a book called The Fighter's Body coauthored with Loren Christensen (which is an awesome book by the way), as well as watching some of his YouTube videos, and was highly impressed with his knowledge, training, and technique. I love martial arts, especially the Chinese styles, and loved that both styles were utilized emphasizing Tiger for bigger, stronger fighters and the Snake for quicker smaller fighters, but then also teaches combining both styles into a very effective combination of self defense. This is an amazing DVD. The way Wim combines the Tiger and Snake styles will improve your skills as a martial artist significantly. Highly recommended.",1481846400,,740,5.024390243902439
