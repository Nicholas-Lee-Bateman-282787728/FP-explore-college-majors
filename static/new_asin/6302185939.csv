7822220,3,6302185939,"I had the privilege of seeing this for the first time last night and was surprised I had never heard of it.  Slater in his first starring role plays a deranged 15 year old with a truly scary sadistic streak.  When his rich and clueless parents leave for a party one evening, The little hellion psychologically tortures the already troubled new babysitter.  This film is low budget but not super low budget.  Slater is completely convincing in his role and I felt a palpable sense of dread throughout most of this film that for the most part never let up.  Surprising that this hasn't been released on dvd yet even for the fact that it was Slaters breakthrough role.  He would go on to play a different kind of nut in the cult classic Heathers.  If you can manage to find this somewhere it is worth a watch but don't pay big bucks for it because it isn't a classic or anything.",1371686400,,876,4.37037037037037

It actually is not a regular copy--it is one that was made for promotional use only so every now and then up on the screen comes ""PROPERTY OF HEMDALE HOME VIDEO, FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY.""  These are not to be sold.  This was misrepresented.",1341360000,,304,4.392857142857143
