8152186,5,B000JMK9SW,"Ermanno Olmi has been one of the best of the post-NeoRealist Italian directors, whose early features Il POSTO and I FIDANZATI have been justly celebrated. THE LEGEND OF THE HOLY DRINKER was a bit of a departure for him, in that he was using well-known actors in a very literary story. Olmi's attention to detail and his adherence to creating a very believable environment pay off in this moving allegory about redemption. Though the film is filled with recognizable actors, such as Rutger Hauer and Anthony Quayle, they show great dedication and blend in to the carefully selected backgrounds. This is another superb BluRay/DVD package from Arrow!",1509840000,,647,5.05607476635514
8152187,3,B000JMK9SW,"The Legend of the Holy Drinker,"" winner of the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival, is adapted from a novella by Joseph Roth. The setting is Paris in 1934. A tramp, Andreas Kartak (Rutger Hauer), exiled in Paris and haunted by a criminal past, sees no way out of his predicament until he is offered 200 francs by a wealthy stranger whose only request is that, when he can afford it, he return the money to a chapel dedicated to St. Theresa. A man of honor but weak of will, the derelict attempts to rejoin the world, finding work, keeping company with women, dining out and sleeping in beds. But these luxuries distract from his obligation.

Every Sunday, however, things come up and Andreas repeatedly fails to repay his debt even though he has been fortunate enough to have additional money come his way. Flashbacks portray Andreas early life in Silesia, his work there as a miner, and the reasons for his departure. Throughout the film, he sees apparitions and delusions induced by his chronic drinking.

Director Ermanno Olmi provides rich characterization for Andreas, offering an intelligent study of moral complexity, responsibility, spirituality, and social ostracism. Bauer is exceptional as Andreas, portraying the derelict sympathetically. His small windfall has allowed the man to move among social strata previously closed off to him, and he is treated as a person, rather than a nameless blight.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD release include a 10-minute interview with Rutger Hauer, interview with Ermanno Olmis co-screenwriter Tullio Kezich, and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1506470400,3,1654,5.164179104477612
