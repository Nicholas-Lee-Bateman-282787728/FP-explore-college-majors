5635536,5,B00BJW66GK,"""Twilight in Volterra"" whisked me away from my living room to the beautiful world of Volterra, Italy.  The Volturi are such a mysterious part of the Twilight universe that it was wonderful to see the heritage of their base city revealed.  I loved to see the inhabitants of the town, speaking about the books that are now a part of their lives.  The HD looked amazing on my monitor and I can't decide if my appetite for visiting Italy is sated or if I just want to go NOW!!!",1363564800,11,473,4.292134831460674

5635538,3,B00BJW66GK,"Interesting, especially the last 15 minutes where the viewer is taken around the town.  But it's mostly talking heads who repeat the same things and add nothing new to the film.  I've no interest in Twilight, but a lot of interest in the 3,000 year old Volterra.",1428192000,,262,4.553191489361702
5635539,5,B00BJW66GK,"Great for the Twilight junkie like myself. I have traveled to Forks, WA twice with my hubby and we've also been to Oregon to see the actual filming locations, for the first movie at least. We are planning to visit Italy for our big vacation in the next few years.  I will be going to see Montepulciano, you can bet!!",1421539200,3,316,4.266666666666667

5635542,4,B00BJW66GK,"gives you a better understanding about the mystery ,intriguing and should be given to any fan of the twilight series",1394755200,,116,4.85
5635543,5,B00BJW66GK,"Love this video! Although the Twilight Saga films were done somewhere else, since Volterra features so prominently in the books, the city chose to entertain the many book lovers and share itself with them. Fascinating history and story of this ancient city. This video just makes me wish to see it in person.",1374019200,,308,4.830188679245283
5635544,2,B00BJW66GK,"This movie introduced you to the place where the author of the Twilight series used in some of her depictions. It shows you places where things in the book describes and might really happened there. It is quite interesting to know that there really was certain historical places used, and if I get it right, she had no idea at the time she was writing the book were even there and really took place-or maybe have taken place.  It is a narrative of Volterra and it's people of that area.  It really is interesting in the history of Lolterra and how the twilight series interacts.  I was lost in some of the interviews as they talked so fast and with heavy accents.  Much of it sounds to be speculative.",1372032000,2,701,4.410852713178294
5635545,5,B00BJW66GK,"As a 66-year-old Twihard great-grandmother, I love the Twilight books (read 16 times, so far) and love Stephenie Meyer for writing them.  Nearly two years ago a friend and I visited Forks, a lovely town with wonderful residents who enjoyed having Twilighters there.  It appears the residents of Volterra have also graciously welcomed the many Twilight fans from around the world.  Learning about the real Volterra (3,500 years old) was an absolute treat for me.  Now I have to have the DVD.  Thanks, Amazon, for making it available.",1365292800,26,532,5.0
5635546,4,B00BJW66GK,"A fun documentary about the real city of Volterra, Italy. Fans of ""New Moon"" by Stephenie Meyer will enjoy seeing the ""home"" of the Volturi and the different areas where the characters could've actually been.",1365120000,7,208,4.9714285714285715
