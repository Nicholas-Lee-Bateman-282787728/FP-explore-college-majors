4428905,1,B004M8SRHO,"Watched this movie on Netflix. So glad I didn't pay for it.

Filled with half-truths, unsupported assertions, and complete misinformation that's easily checked with a 45 second Google search, this ""movie"" uses star power, scare tactics, and emotional appeal to try and convince people that everything is horrible and the world is coming to an end. The biggest problem with it is that it doesn't even offer any solutions to the problems that it says exist. Kinda like Zeitgeist.

Look, I agree with the movie when it says that huge Multinational corporations like Exxon-Mobil, Dow Chemical, and Amazon.com are evil-bad-nasties and we need to keep them in check, but if someone arrives at the right conclusion by bad information, then someone else points that bad information out and disproves it, the person will go back to the bad way of thinking, it's going to be harder to convince them of the truth in the future, even with good facts.",1338681600,5,938,4.8930817610062896

First of all we do not want democracy.  We want a republic.  This was never brought up.  We have democracy now and it does not work.  Capitalism is a good thing but it only works when YOU do.  Ethos took excerpts from several films I have seen and combined them into mini-versions via this film.  Some of it was very close to plagiarism.

If you wish to be free of fossil fuel, begin to educate yourself about marijuana and hemp.  Fuel and oil can be made from hemp.  Please read Audubon's Incite: Legalize It for a list of the magnificent products that can be produced from this incredible plant.  However, the police and private prisons obtain human prisoners which become ""legal"" slaves and the profits are HUGE so they do not want it legalized.  The oil men do not want this, nor do the timber men, soybean and corn farmers, cotton producers, the cancer industry does not want anyone to know about the cure.  I could go on and on here.

It's a wonder they never had an even remotely stable government or society. I say so-called because their views aren't exactly what I'd call Kosher, or even within a thousand miles of it.

He is pushing a pro-Palestinian ridiculous idea that terrorism is a fantasy- that terror by Islamic radicals is just an invention of the media which he tells everyone in his lectures and books is run by Jews, that the banks are run by Jews- I find it fascinating how in his film he only inferred it. This film is a vile attempt at brainwashing human beings against successful Jews. It does mention many truths mixed in with his fantasies pretending that 9_11 was a conspiracy. The only joke is on us who buy into no am Chomsky, the linguist. Why do we listen to a guy with only an honorary degree in language?

The magical difference is that everything will eventually rectify itself if we shop mindfully.

They ironically make a case that a fundamental problem in our system is the ability for human behaviour to be manipulated through emotional pleas and not via a preponderous of facts.  Its evident they are intellectually honest in their belief as the entire video cynically goes about making their case with thinly supported emotional pleas.  For instance... They make an argument against the federal reserve as a privately owned bank that the government is beholden to that makes profits on the interest paid by the government on debt owed to the reserve.  This is true.  However, I was yelling at the TV ""but tell them where federal reserve profits go!"".  Federal reserve profits get paid right back to the government...

4428974,2,B004M8SRHO,"The film doesn't start off very well, #1 it's dedicated to Howard Zinn, a extreme ideologue that's life mission was to rewrite history to fit his own ideological 'ethos'. It then has Woody Harrelson, another known extreme ideological person narrating it so one's baloney detector is immediately put on high alert.

GOOD POINTS:

Admits that the media is agenda driven.

Admits that the public opinion is driven by the media.

Shows that both democrats and republicans are much more similar than they are different.

Admits that politicians on both sides are bought and paid for.

Admits that bankruptcy of the US (the debt crisis) is the biggest problem but doesn't spend more than 10 seconds talk about it.

The solution that the film presents is good.

BAD POINTS:

Completely ignores 70% (the MAJORITY) of the money that is used to buy politicians. If they talked about that the premise of the film (corporations run the world) would have collapsed on itself.

The constant use of extreme ideologues (Chomsky, Zinn, Benn, Michael Moore, McKinney, Said, Johnson, etc) to promote the films agenda, with no balance comes off as just a ideological rant designed for the choir.

The film stirs up the long disproven conspiracy theories about the federal reserve (a system that most first world nations use btw). See Wikipedia (facts, data and evidence) for good rebuttals to the poppycock (fear mongering-propaganda) spewed in this film.

BTW, if the US government didn't BORROW money to pay it's debt and instead just printed it we would destabilize our currency and hyper-inflation would result. Happens every time a country has done this so nobody is that stupid to try this, except of course the filmmakers.

The history given from 1921-1929 and then the great depression was probably one of the greatest works of fiction I have ever heard. WOW, the filmmakers are counting on that the viewer (YOU) is completely ignorant about history and highly gullible to believe anything they say.

Claims that the media won't cover stories about big businesses but a lexis/nexis search proves that this is 100% false, in fact American media is much more likely to cover a negative story than other first nation media outlets.

Keeps promoting the idea that America is a Democracy (or was) - the fact is it never was a democracy and the founding fathers worked very hard NOT to create a democracy, which they considered mob rule and a very unstable form of government.

The claim that we invaded Iraq to install permanent bases was false when the film was made (2011). We were drawing out the troops as planned back in 2006 that we would vacate in 2011. The fact that the filmmakers are so willing to brazenly lie to their audience shows just how stupid they think YOU are.

Talks about how fear is a motivating factor but totally missed the point that fear was much more paralyzing to the ideological group that this film is targeted to.

It then uses fear to motivate (scare) it's intended audience with a bunch of manufactured hyperbole and extreme conspiracy theories. It then says to be wary of people who use fear to manipulate people to certain way of thinking. Was anybody else drowning in the irony?

The film then says that people may be scared enough that they will want a one world government, wait a second, isn't that exactly what many of the films ideologues say will save us?????

BOTTOM LINE:

The most disjointed part of the film came at the end when Woody Harrelson was telling us what to do to stop this evil that is enveloping us. IF you believe what the film and it's extreme ideologues throughout it says is true, then his recommendation will have ZERO impact. Something is amiss. It would be my contention that the filmmaker wanted to hammer home the point that we can change the way corporations operate just by using our purchasing dollars, but he felt he needed to use fear and propaganda to get you to listen which is sad but very indicative of how people manipulate others. I'll give the filmmaker props, he knows his target audience and he knows that they are the ones most swayed by fear.",1374624000,2,4109,4.77542372881356

While I agree with the solution if offers (i.e., consumers using their purchasing power to change corporate behavior), that solution has no impact on America's permanent war economy and defense spending.

The editing was horrid and there was literally nothing in this documentary that you wouldn't find in other documentaries. It was like a group of people saw how successful Zeitgeist was, so they got a bunch of other documentaries together that focused on similar topics, took what they liked out of each, and edited in Harrelson's commentary along with the footage they culled instead of trying to do anything original.  Ugh.

4428994,2,B004M8SRHO,"I have a few issues with this movie.

""Capitalism doesn't work in a world of finite resources.""

A few things need to be addressed here. First of all, people, for the most part, people are not willing to work for the benefit of ""society"" for extended periods of time. History clearly illustrates this. So if you want to debate something(capitalism), you have to acknowledge the fact that the alternatives to the thing you're critiquing are flawed in the extreme. Ignoring this basic truth means this movie has serious problems from the very beginning.

In regards to the environmental problems with capitalism, the same problem with excluding facets of capitalism exists. When you have a free market, companies produce things more efficiently because of competition. That means that as time goes on, more is produced with less. How do you produce a movie like this and ignore that fact?

How do you discuss the environmental problems with capitalism and population growth while ignoring the fact that as people become more prosperous, population growth slows fairly significantly. Look at the USA! What is our population growth when you take away immigration? Here's a hint: It's ZEEEEEERRRROOOO.

This movie represents everything wrong with modern political discourse. Instead of genuinely wanting to address problems, the people behind this movie have a point of view and the movie is merely a delivery method for it.

PS - In no way am I arguing that the issues being discussed in aren't real problems. I just think they fell into the trap that any documentary like this risks being caught by. It's too biased.",1345161600,4,1613,5.022471910112359
4428995,2,B004M8SRHO,"I had to watch this documentary for a college class, and in my opinion it is blatant scaremongering. Ignoring the poor editing, video, script and delivery, Ethos tries to prove to its audience that there are secrets and hidden meanings in our everyday lives. I was confused watching it, since many of the ""secrets"" it tries to expose are actually common knowledge, many of which is already taught in schools. The hidden meanings Ethos explores are also hearsay, most anyone would have heard before, with nothing but unfounded speculation to support it. What I disliked the most was that it takes many people's words out of context, and tries to re-frame them to suit its revealing secrets plot. I was not impressed, and I encourage those who watch Ethos to keep a open mind and level head while doing so.",1342051200,,804,4.75
4428996,3,B004M8SRHO,"Woody Harrelson does an excellent job narrating this documentary, but the rest of the presentation is flawed: sound goes in and out; video segments are very poorly done, and there should have been more comments from the intellectual giants mentioned in the film. And they left out Naomi Klein who could have added her take on how corporations and government prey on catastrophes to enact their reactionary agendas. If you stick with the movie it does have some excellent points but the advice at the end is a huge letdown. And Harrellson should have totally avoided any reference to conspiracy theories. No doubt corporations run our lives and even more so today. This film was made before the Citizens United ruling, and no mention is made at all of the conservative bent of the Supreme Court. Our Congress was derelict in its duty to properly review the facts that led to the iraq war. We are now a warfare state more so than a welfare state. The Patriot Act should never have been passed and both political parties will have to answer for this usurption of our Constitutional rights. Our police forces have beome more militaristic, and the media has been feeding us the corporatist line for decades. The rhetoric from the right calling the media ""liberal"" would be laughable but it is more sad. We can barely count on the N.Y. Times to give us the facts we need to make intelligent decisions as citizens, and the U.S. is mainly apathetic on political affairs and prone to actually believe the sound bites thrown at them. All these points and more are made in the movie but what we can do about them was the biggest letdown. Just avoiding companies that promote reactionary agendas is a start but it puts the citizenry in a huge economic box. We need to really talk about the apathetic nature of America and why more people don't vote. The real power is at the ballot box which is why Republican governors are pulling out the stops on voter-id laws to prevent the unrich from voting. The movie should have focused more on that.",1341964800,9,2029,4.654596100278551

Many are not awake and if you are one, view this and you will be awaken! If you are wondering about what is going on around you and in the world, Watch this and be informed and then take action!

Some of the action we have taking, is cutting off cable, (now we have Netflix, through our Roku and Logic Tech Revue this gives us better T.V. for a better price. We have our DVD collection, and we also have more local channels now that we have turned off the cable and replaced that with a antenna and converter box. This helps our pockets and keeps us from watching the trash that is now on T.V. There are some things we miss, but don't miss the cost. We stream sports and anything that is missing we look to the internet for it. We were tired of paying for trash T.V. and at the end of the year had nothing to show for all the money we were paying for T.V. This DVD confirmed we did the right thing and are on the right track with cutting down our consumption. Now we don't see all the advisement's that are discussed in this DVD to get you to spend spend!

We also stopped shopping with companies that don't support communities, nature, ones that are not responsible etc.. We have changed and are changing the way we do business with anyone. We will continue to work on our consumption rate as discussed in this documentary. We look for companies that are responsible and don't pollute the water, earth etc.

We have always grown our own food this way we can help the Vanishing Of Bees which is another great documentary to view! This also allows us to know where our produce is coming from and what is in it.

We also have always received news media from other sources. We don't take what the media puts out and run with it..  So we have always received news through other methods.. NPR, National Geo, Mother Earth, newspapers and many other online websites, etc.. Be informed and educate your self on what is going on. This is a great start for many who may not know or who may have some information but want more.

We learned so much from this DVD! The information you will find will be very valuable to you and awaken you. There is so much more in this DVD that I did not mention (like information on the banks, federal reserve, wars etc). You will have to make your purchase to see this amazing informative DVD!

unable to think for themselves. Those persons dumb ed down by our public school system who never learned a critical thinking process or to think independently just may realize that everything said in this DVD is accurate and take this information as a wake up call. For example, most US citizens think the Federal Reserve is a government agency, they don't understand the Fed is owned by the banks and wall street and is a PRIVATE Corporation. It's one and only purpose is to make money for its owners and bankrupt the economy. This way we all are in debt up to our eye balls and spend our lives in poverty.(Large economic disruptions will start to occur in the very near future, as it has already started in Europe)

Basically this is a very good film to show in High School each and every year, so the students just might not be like their parents. Only able to follow, unable to think, and ready for serfdom without even realizing they have been had by a very smart government. Think of the peanut trick at the old carny.
