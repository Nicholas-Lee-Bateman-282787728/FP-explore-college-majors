7948121,5,B00005NX24,"I love this DVD. I just watch every match on this DVD, anxiously. It just might be my favorite XPW DVD out of the about ten XPW DVDs that I own in my collection. If its not my favorite, then Retribution is my favorite. But my favorite just might be Redemption.",1350777600,,260,4.117647058823529
7948122,4,B00005NX24,"Rising Sun & Ultrataro Jr vs Excalibur & Super Dragon-Very good match. Probably the best match of the card that is not a hardcore match. The costumes of the wrestlers seem very sloppy. Other then that, great.

Dynamite D vs Kraq with Angel: I like Dynamite D's gimmick but the guy couldn't wrestle to save his life. Apparently Kraq and Angel are gay but Kraq didn't really potray it till the end when he said he'd release his black snake and Angel got on his knees. A decent but entertaining match.

Dynamite D vs Nosawa-Happens right after this match. Nosawa is colorful and a decent match.

Pogo the Clown vs John Kronus-Very good match but very short. Hated the ending. Kind of a Big Daddy V ending here.

Lady Victoria vs Angel-Sloppy match. Victoria cant wrestle to save a life, I like Angel's character. He can put on a good match as well, just not this one.

Homeless Jimmy vs Steve Rizzono-Decent hardcore match.

Supreme vs Vic Grimes- Two very big men who almost look the same; The only way you could tell who was who was the tatoo on Supreme's head Supereme is a great brawler but probably never make it to the bigger leauges.

Mexico's Most Wanted vs Vampiro and Shaggy 2 dope-I never got why ICP wrestles. Mexico's Most Wanted is fun to watch. A great match.

Lizzy Borden vs Major Gunns- Skip

Kaos vs White Trash Johnny Webb-Excellent hardcore match.

New Jack vs The Messiah- Ive always loved New Jack. This match is just friggin awesome.

Overall, one of the better XPW dvds. The sound off is better too; These commentators suck really bad. Its one of the drawbacks to watching these dvds. A few matches are real sloppy but its still fun to watch. Wrestlers swearing is pointles and it just seems they do it to get a reaction. The hardcore matches are really fun to watch.",1207958400,,1789,4.524844720496894
7948123,5,B00005NX24,"Rising Sun & Ultrataro Jr vs Excalibur & Super Dragon- Excellent high flying extravaganza! It was a very quick passed and high flying match. I think these teams managed to use every high flying move I have seen. Just an excellent match! Grade A

Dynamite D vs Kraq (with Angel)- More of a brawl, with a little wrestling mixed in. I have never seen Kraq, he is a huge 6'6 400 pounder. I am surprised WWE hasn't tried to sign him. They both moved fairly well, and it was a solid match. Only weird part was at the end Kraq mentions something about his snake, and Angel gets on his knees in front of him? Umm.. yeah.... Grade B-

Dynamite D vs Nosawa- Nosawa jumps him right after the match. They begin to wrestle in the ring and they are actually starting a new match. Good match, Dynamite did the 2nd match fairly well. Nosawa was impressive as usual. Grade B

Pogo the Clown vs John Kronus- Very good match. It was a high paced affair for 2 big men. Kronus who is now at 340 pounds can still hit an amazing 450 splash. Pogo took a lot of punishment, but gave as good as he can get. Grade B+

Lady Victoria vs Angel- Victoria missed a lot of moves, and didn't look very good. Angel was trying to do his best to sell things. It was hard to believe, the ending. Grade D

Homeless Jimmy vs Steve Rizzono (the enterprise)- Homeless Jimmy dominated for most of the match. He used a wide variety of weapons. Yet in the end the numbers game worked against him. Rizzono hit some wicked moves at the end. Grade B

Supreme vs Vic Grimes- Brutal hardcore match. Both of them hit some huge moves, both hardcore and high impact. Supreme kicked out after a top rope splash from the 500 pound Grimes. Grimes missed rolling tumbleweed and appears to crack his skull on the concrete. Supreme goes for a corkscrew splash and end us hitting heads with Grimes. Grade A

Mexico's Most Wanted vs Vampiro and Shaggy 2 dope- This was an amazing match. MMW is a great team and always puts on a great match. Vampiro is one of my favorites because he combines great classic wrestling, power moves, and high flying. One reason this match didn't get rated higher is because Shaggy is terrible. Grade A-

Lizy Borden vs Major Gunns- well its not a match, just a spanking.

Kaos vs White Trash Johnny Webb- Deathmatch! Wow what a great match. We saw light tubes, barbwire, tables, thumb tacks, kendo sticks, and chairs. The match stayed at a great pace. Neither of them wanted to give up and each took a massive beating. Both of them had so many thumb tacks in there boots they where sliding around. A sick missed moonsault and Kaos landed on the tacks and light tubes. Grade A

New Jack vs The Messiah- Just amazing! They battle and brawl all over the ring. New Jack bring a ton of weapons and they are all used. At the end both wrestlers are a bloody mess. Also other wrestlers hit the ring, and we get to see one of the best finishes ever. A New Jack 40 ft dive! To quote ECW fans Holy S#!%. Grade A+

Overall Grade A-

Just a great DVD, it was 2 and half hours long, instead of the usual 60 minutes. Every match was exciting to watch. It had a nice mix of great wrestling and some awesome hardcore matches. I am still shocked I got this DVD brand new for $4? WOW! Get this DVD you won't be disappointed.",1178236800,2,3274,4.288492706645057
7948124,4,B00005NX24,"some classic New Jack here, he goes against the messiah in the main event resulting in some brutal weapon action. Feels like a legitimate grudge between the two, exchanging insults between each bloody blow the crowd just eats it up. At one point New Jack says Messiah punches like a B**** and the crowd busts up.

Messiah grabs NJ's guitar and gives it a honky tonk strum but NJ letting the crowd know that he will not be having that grabs back his guitar gives it a triple stomping strum and smashes it over the head of Messiah sounding like a bomb went off. Deathmatch White Trash Johnny Webb vs Kaos is even more brutal goes right along side Baptised in Blood, thumbtacks, bed of nails, light tubes. Kaos bleeds like a hydrant and Johnny Web almost refusing to take any of the bumps and overselling it when he does leaving Kaos with the big hospital bill. Debut of Vampiro and Shaggy along with Patrik and Rude Boy. Vampiro

in great condition comming off a broken neck wrestling like he's hungry, shaggy takes more than a few shots but also brings it damien and 666 of mexicos most wanted, good match with Vampiro doing much of the teaching. Supreme vs Vic Grimes non deathmatch style but still hard hitting just because of the size of the two, a little pizza cutter action from grimes and messiah trying to interfere but supreme still pulls it off. Rest of the undercard socal jobbers also a light weight japanese mexican lucha libre 4 man tag match flying around the ring like circus monkeys, technically could be considered the match of the show.

upc 689967366642  2 hours 26 min + Baptised In Blood 3 preview Overall good as long your not expecting ECW.",1111622400,,1662,4.548494983277592
7948125,4,B00005NX24,"This is only the second XPW video Ive seen, and instead of giving you a rundown off all the matches Ill just write the main matches down:
Lucha Lebre Match - The match on the video is probably the best Lucha Lebre Match I have ever seen, there are some moves in here I didn't even think were possible.  There were no tables smashed or chair shots, and it was still a great match, Id rather watch matches like this then TLC matches. 5/5
Supreme Vs. Vic Grimes - Average match, these guys can take big bumps, so when theres no weapons around, like in this match, it kind of drags on. 3/5
Lizzy Borden Vs. Major Gunns - Nothing really happens, as soon as the match starts Lizzy calls out the Black Army to hold down Gunns so she can spank her. 2/5
White Trash Johnny Webb Vs. Kid Kaos - Pretty good death match with quite a few big spots, lightbulb tubes and thumbtacks flying everywhere.  If Kid Kaos would stop OVER sellling he'd be a really great all round wrestler. 4/5
Vampiro and Shaggy2dope? Vs. Halloween and Damien 666 - Too many missed spots to even count, mostly done by Shaggy. 2/5
New Jack Vs. The Messiah - Average match with a bit of action, but after the match is when the fun starts.  Grimes, Supreme, Shaggy, Vampiro and Lazy all come out, Grimes gets duct taped to a table then New Jack jumps at least 35-40 feet on top of him. 5/5
The other XPW tape Ive seen, Baptised in Blood 2 is better then this one, but this was a pretty strong show, and worth the money, and I think I speak for every XPW fan when I say when is XPW Freefall coming out?",1021075200,2,1559,4.19
