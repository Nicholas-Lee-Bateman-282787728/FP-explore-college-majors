8016074,1,B0001Q5U1C,I wouldn't have ordered this if I had known I was only receiving ONE dvd. To make matters worse I received the Second dvd and not the First. How misleading!,1401408000,,156,4.233333333333333
8016075,5,B0001Q5U1C,"This is 2 DVDs with 2 volumes/lessons/classes of both Karate & Jiu Jitsu in each one.
It starts with a long intro of Rita Sever (tv host personality) demonstrating the moves on several attackers in each of the many possible daily situations.
You learn along side Rita, her asking all the questions & making the mistakes you would ask. Both instructors have several degree black belts, show a lot of power/great technique when demonstrating on other assistants, cover almost any question you could have & are very patient, good-natured & friendly. They demonstrate both on other male assistants full speed & force & work with Rita slowly then over & over until she can do it full speed as well.
The chapters are broken up to just kicks, just blocks, grappling, etc.
There is a quick recap in each volume since they teach a lot of info.
There are workouts that include first agood amount of simple stretching in karate & balance moves to help increase your control for Jiu Jitsu, then simple practicing of each move you learned in that volume for about 10-20 min.
There is another chapter of teaching combinations with the insructors calling out moves for Rita to do against a bag, etc. for 10 min.

Disk 2 has lesson 3 & 4. Lesson 3: wrist grabs, clothes grab, shoulder & arm grabs, front & rear bear hugs, recaping what you learned & a short workout.
Lesson 4: front & rear chokes, headlocks, ground attacks, recapping what you learned & a short workout.

This is a great DVD set, the production quality is superb, the camerawork, the style of dvd, the great, very detailed instruction from the instructors, etc.",1156377600,9,1612,4.692579505300353
