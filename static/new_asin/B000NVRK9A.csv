8182037,5,B000NVRK9A,This is fine for the mature history buff. I purchased this item for middle school viewing. Not going to happen.,1399852800,2,111,4.6
8182038,1,B000NVRK9A,"I do not have a large TV so usually picture clarity is okay but this was not and it used a lot of the same old movies versus contemporary photographs while the narrator talked.
I do not think it was even worth $5 and could only watch it 5 minutes both because of picture clarity but also sheer boredom.
I expected more from American Heritage since they have such a good magazine...or had (I do not know if the magazine is still published).
Ken Burn's civil war dopcumentary is much, much better (I would give it 5 stars)but more expensive.
Still, although the price for that high quality documentary is a lot more than this DVD...the whole thing is on one disc which might explain the poor picture quality, I imagine it is many minutes so, broken down, it is probably a much better value and top notch.",1364774400,,802,4.425675675675675
8182039,4,B000NVRK9A,"I taught U.S. History in the 1980s and I wish I had this DVD at that time, it would
have made my job easy.  A good study on the causes and progress of the Civil War.  I
would recommend this to a student and a Civil War buff.  I purchased in the used
category and it looks new and never played, I made a great purchase.",1337126400,,318,3.787878787878788
