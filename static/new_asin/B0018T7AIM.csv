8271060,4,B0018T7AIM,"I always enjoy watching this video.  I found it used in a store several years ago.  It is just fellows hunting and enjoying it.  No monster bucks taken, but lots of good hunting action.  I would love to contact Bill Shirer and Bobby Tucker to see if they are still hunting and doing any filming.  If either of you read this review, send me a note via this comment!",1250640000,,364,4.217391304347826
