7934025,5,B000059PRX,"The Passion and Power of this 1992 ABC TELEVISION remake is displayed more so in this version than the Hitchcock version. John Shea's acting is always great, he is most known for acting as Lex Luther in the Lois & Clark television series. But the best actor in this movie is Marisa Berenson (Barry Lyndon). Her character is always icy and quite intriguing.
BY FAR BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL.",993081600,4,389,4.6521739130434785
