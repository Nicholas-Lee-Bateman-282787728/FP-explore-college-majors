805332,5,6304196660,"This is an awesome movie! From the beginning, when a chorus of professional-looking Marines sing the praises of Christmas at Pee Wee's to the ending, when Pee Wee, having completed his new wing made of fruitcake, helps Santa deliver his gifts, there's never a dull moment.",1034035200,,272,4.934782608695652
805333,5,6304196660,Miss Yvonne sneaks a wave at the hunks building Pee Wee's fruitcake addition and guess what....the dinosaur family is Jewish! kd lang is boyish-skirted-gorgeous singing Jingle Bell Rock...Grace Jones is total trip-weird and if you grew up listening to the 12 Days of Xmas overmuch then you'll love Pee Wee giving Dinah Shore the slip whilst she on and ons. The slow mo pinata scene brings tears to my eyes. Perfect cool segment there with Charro. Extra cool Penny cartoon. We watch it again and again and even sometimes not in winter. Pee Wee is the king of styley art and this video is an American classic.,1008460800,2,607,4.682242990654205
805334,5,6304196660,"When this special first aired, it kept getting more and more incredible as the minutes went on.  All the stars!  All the music!  From the opening production number till Dinah Shore's last notes - a completely entertaining show, and in this persons opinion, the very best hour of television ever. Nice to see Frankie and Annette together again.  Power to Pee Wee!",1001894400,3,362,4.790322580645161
805335,5,6304196660,"This is the best christmas special ever! I watch this movie every Christmas and I never get tired of it. I really liked K.D. Lang, Little  Richard, Oprah Winfrey, Joan Rivers and the one and only Pee-wee Herman. If  you don't have this movie yet, go to a video store and buy it. If you  already own this movie, sit down on the coach at christmas time and watch  it with your entire family.",966124800,,389,4.216216216216216
805336,5,6304196660,"This is a great treat for Christmas, but Pee Wee is always cool. Turn the old Christmas videos on their head and party with Pee Wee and Friends. Includes all the Pee Wee Playhouse craziness. It's a pity that Pee Wee has  been hounded off TV. He's great for kids and adults alike.",933724800,4,279,4.264150943396227

805477,5,6304196660,"I got these movies for my daughter.  She loves Pee Wee.  I have to admit I do to.  I remember being a kid and watching Pee Wee's Playhouse on TV every saturday.  I would use the word of the day everyday for a week.  Every time some one would say it, I wold scream just like Pee Wee.  I guess it is just good clean humor.  This is perfect for kids and families.  No curse words, no violence, just silly antics and absurd humor.  If you remember Pee Wee at all you will love this.  My package arrived on time and was packaged neatly.  I will definitely buy from again",1470960000,,565,4.045454545454546
805478,5,6304196660,"I assume if you're looking at this item that you know a bit about Peewee's Playhouse.  This Christmas special has all the usual hilarity of Peewee's show with a ton more fun added for the holidays.  The guest list is a hoot.  There are cameos from stars like Oprah and Whoopi begging Peewee to let them on his show.  Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon are doing crafts.  Little Richard is trying to learn how to ice skate.  The best are the musical guests.  I'm not a big Grace Jones fan, but she is a hoot singing The Little Drummer Boy wearing a hat that appears to be made out of a sheet of poster board.  k. d. lang does a rousing song with some critters.  To me the camp highlight is the Del Rubio Triplets, three middle aged women dressed up in snow bunny, mini skirts.  The bonus features are an audio commentary track and a Peewee featurette.
The guest list includes...
Frankie Avalon
Grace Jones
Dinah Shore
Whoopi Goldberg
k.d. lang
The Del Rubio Triplelt
LIttle Richard
Charo
Annette Funicello
Zsa Zsa Gabor
Magic Johnson
Joan Rivers

Yes, I remember watching Pee Wee on Saturday mornings many years ago, so I sort of knew what to expect, but when the b-list actors start showing up at the playhouse it's wacky, and nutty, and golly, it's cuckoo!",1418947200,,361,4.402985074626866

805972,5,6304196660,"You can have your Rudolph and your Frosty. This is the real deal, and the only thing in its league is Chuck Jones' ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" (the 30-minute cartoon, not that awful drawn-out movie.)

It starts off with the Marine choir, and has the best opening I have ever seen. Everybody and his brother makes a brief guest appearance, from Dinah Shore to Little Richard. It's innocent enough for kids and has lots of double-entendre stuff for the adults. And it has a great ending, with Pee-Wee realizing that, in his anticipation, he has been too selfish. So he and Santa come to a really satisfying solution. Get it for your kids, and if you don't have kids, get it for yourself and share it with your friends, neices and newphews.",1388102400,,742,4.578947368421052

806314,5,6304196660,"Pee Wee's Playhouse was assuredly the 'children's show' twisted this way and that to appeal to adults, with the emphasis on 'twisted'.  And I guess probably only some adults will enjoy its humor.... including this IMHO Christmas special, best viewed with a whole lot of one's closest friends, a good bottle or two of wine and a joint to pass around.  It's cute and bit bizarre all at the same time.  I usually watch it as a 'prequel' with ""The Dame Edna Experience: The Christmas Specials"".  Both are well-worth your dollars to have.",1260057600,,533,4.698924731182796

I loved Pee Wee's Playhouse  when it was a new show, so I really enjoy re-watching them with my children.  And there is nothing ""bad"" in it or objectionable,so my 11 yr old can watch it too.

It's as insanely & surreally hilarious as the Saturday morning TV show, but it also has a good message about selflessness (without being preachy about it), plus even acknowledging the celebration of Jesus' birth as the origin of Christmas!  My favorite part is when Grace Jones (!!) sings ""Little Drummer Boy"" while at the playhouse (probably the strangest rendition of that song I've ever heard or seen!), when she was misdelivered there!  (She was actually being mailed to the WHITE House -- I didn't know Reagan was into that kind of music!)  Hilarious year-round viewing!!",1106352000,5,649,5.037383177570093

806571,4,6304196660,"From 1988 and broadcast just once, comes this gem from the mind of Paul Reubens. Released in 2004 along with the rest of the ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" output, this stand alone special has been a yearly tradition in our household. Now we can retire our videotape for the DVD format.

The special features are limited, only two, and they are both commentaries. The first one features Paul Reubens, co-writer John Paragon (who also plays Jambi) and Lynne Marie Stewart who plays Miss Yvonne, the most beautiful lady in all of Playland. The second commentary features four of the puppeteers who certainly had a lot to do in the special. The insights and tidbits on both of these commentaries are a great bonus.

The show itself is fast paced and gives you a chance to visit with some old friends. Pee Wee's humor may not be for all, but if you enjoyed the series, you will certainly enjoy this special where holiday traditions are examined and lessons of the spirit of giving are learned.

The supporting cast includes members who have gone on to bigger things including Laurence Fishburne as Cowboy Curtis and S. Epatha Merkerson as Reba The Mail Lady (who is now a regular on NBC's ""Law and Order"" minus the dreadlocks). The guests include Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, Charo, The Del Rubio Triplets, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Whoopi Goldberg, Magic Johnson, Grace Jones, k.d. lang, Little Richard, Joan Rivers, Dinah Shore and Oprah Winfrey. Stars, music, fun, a great package.

The transfer is fresh from the masters with Dolby Digital sound and is close-captioned. Highly recommended if you want to catch the Christmas spirit.",1101772800,26,1620,4.858695652173913
806572,5,6304196660,"Saw this when it originally aired and in it Pee Wee tells Whoopi Goldberg that she may be able to join the Christmas Special not the next year, but the year after. Since then, I have been waiting for it's sequel, but I suppose it will never come.

The Marine Corps singers, Del Rubio Triplets and Charro. Throw Billy Baloney in there and you've got the greatest show on Earth.",1100649600,3,376,4.371428571428571

Pee-wee's list for Santa is so long there won't be anything left for the other children on Santa's route! Pee-Wee learns the true meaning of the Christmas spirit when he is taught the joy of sharing.

From the opening sequence, when one of those military boys gooses Pee-Wee, to the final moment, where Dinah Shore sings to the Pee-Wee mannequin, this show is hilarious and touching through and through. kd lang and Grace Jones are delightful. But I think Charo's performance of ""Feliz Navidad"" is the stand-out. Brings a tear every year. All that, and a holiday message that resonates for kids and adults.

Dinah Shore giddily singing without realizing she is annoying everyone?  Pee-Wee and a group of Marines in a dance number?  The answer is you can't help but enjoy every minute of it.  This special just oozes fun and camp.  But the real incredible thing is that it's all about something positive - selfnessness.  And this moral is never beaten over your head or made overly sappy.  It's simply part of the whole.

Pop this DVD in and kids as well as adults will eventually stop what they are doing to watch the amazing antics.  Afterwards everyone will be full of Christmas cheer be it December or the middle of July.  This is truly a SPECIAL Christmas Special.",1098576000,40,919,4.633540372670807

The guest stars all perform well, the highlight for me being Charo, whose performance possessed a special warmth.  The moral of not being selfish is an admirable and all-too-rare one in this day and age, and I applaud Mr. Reubens for his entertaining yet educational material.  Most amazing of all for me was that it was never boring--like all Playhouse episodes, it keeps one's interest with a good pace and variety.

She could easily have done a cool western swing version or something.  Instead she just shouts the lyrics while ""fake laughing"" the whole time.  Also, I know that she's not known for caring a whole lot about her appearance, but what's with the granny dress and sneakers?

You don't have time to stop and think as Pee-Wee welcomes a bizarre array of guests from Magic Johnson to k.d. lang, as well as all the Playhouse regulars.  Who knew Little Richard could skate?  Why was someone mailing Grace Jones to the White House? (Ronald Reagan was celebrating his final Christmas in office when this came out.)  Why is Frankie Avalon making Christmas cards with a potato?
When Pee-Wee stops to point out the real meaning of Christmas, I was expecting a watered-down ""time for giving and sharing"" message, but he actually acknowledges the religious meaning.
