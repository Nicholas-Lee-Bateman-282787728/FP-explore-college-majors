His son Inder Bhalla (Abhishek Bachchan), however, wanted to be a music star and left India after a particularly bad argument with his father, to go abroad with his friend Ronnie. Inder is a very selfish person and has a negative attitude toward romance and marriage because of seeing his parents fight all the time while growing up. He didn't contact his family for years. When he finally has to return to India on some business, he finds that his mother Pammi, (Supriya Pathak) is in an ashram with Alzheimer's disease and his father is deep in debt and being threatened by a gangster  named Chima (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyuband) and his goons over 2 million rupees he owes him. Throughout all this, there is a girl Nimmi (Asin) who is in love with Inder although he keeps brushing her off. She ends up on the plane with him on his flight back to India because her parents are making her marry a man she doesn't love. Nimmi has an optimistic view of life and love, and doesn't give up on Inder even through all the times he rejects her. Not to ruin the story for you, I will just say that there is more to this than initially meets the eye, and to stick with it, and follow it to the end and you won't be sorry. The ending has a very good and powerful message that everyone would do well to see.",1477785600,,1793,5.469314079422382
