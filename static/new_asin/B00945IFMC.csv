5257085,5,B00945IFMC,"Vincent Price gives a strong performance as John Hayes, an American teacher who lives in China, and is arrested by the Communist government. It certainly is worth the price!",1366761600,5,173,5.0

8535609,5,B00945IFMC,"Mr. Price a master in his element as always he speaks to.us in this body of work not as an actor but as the person he portrays as a teacher of the corruption of man kind and how it is often twisted right back on the innocent people. Yet, this being being g human sees all to well more than the others does and tries to warn the people of corruption of their blindness as to what is going on even behind the scenes.",1466380800,,414,3.9404761904761907

8535611,5,B00945IFMC,Love Vincent Price and he was fantastic in this story!,1434499200,,54,4.5
8535612,2,B00945IFMC,"The best part about this particular episode was the commercial for the 56' Packard. As a kid growing up in the 50s, it was nostalgic.  I love Price for his horror movies, so I was very disappointed in this episode.  I'm sure it was a great story if you like this sort of thing, but right now I'm caught up in the moment of Halloween and my focus at this time is horror and scaring myself.  This didn't fit the bill.",1414108800,,415,4.098765432098766

8535614,5,B00945IFMC,Excellent early screenplay by Vincent Price - one of those hidden treasures you may or may not have seen.  A missionary turns the tide on his communist captors.,1408579200,,160,4.714285714285714
8535615,3,B00945IFMC,"The show was good in spite of the technical shortcomings of kinescope recordings from those days.  I'm afraid, however, that the story, as specifically told, would be meaningless to anyone under 40.  My only other criticism is that the story was so over-the-top ""All American""  that it has not aged very well.
On the plus side, the acting was excellent and the meaning of the story rings as true today as ever.  It just needs a little Rod Serling magic.",1404604800,,453,4.625
8535616,4,B00945IFMC,I appreciate Vincent Price.  The film is thought provoking and informative.  It is somewhat educational on the conditions in China during the middle of the last century.,1383436800,2,169,5.222222222222222
