8419957,4,B004AC6PJE,It was ok. It comes with 2 movie's i think ZMD was more better. That would be cool if they made a sequel with a better budget.,1404691200,,126,3.7037037037037037
8419958,3,B004AC6PJE,"Im gonna be honest...""The Graves"" was a bit of a disappointment but ""Zombies of Mass Destruction"" actually wasn't a bad movie. ZMD is your typical horror comedy in the same vein as ""Shaun of the Dead"" and it scores. This movie isn't PC, people get called names that some might call offensive. Luckily not only did I not care, I laughed. Now, as for ""The Graves"", it was a movie good enough for the scy fy channel or chiller but not pay per view. If somebody told me college kids made this movie I might be ok with it...maybe. Now, im not saying it was a bad movie, it was just too cliche for me, it had everything down to the strong female character from the overused formula for slasher movies. So just to make it clear, I would purchase this movie for ZMD alone, if you liked movies like ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Brain Dead"" then pick this up and enjoy a cheap laugh.",1356220800,,898,4.257309941520468
