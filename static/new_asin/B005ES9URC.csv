8468960,5,B005ES9URC,Excellent book for those wanting to become more effective and supple riders.  The exercises translate into your daily lives as well.  Well written and visually appealing.  I highly recommend this DVD and only wish I could have a personal session with this knowledgeable expert.,1413504000,,277,5.25
8468961,2,B005ES9URC,"This DVD was advertised as ""New"", the seals had already been broken, so didn't appear to be new, when I opened my shipping package. Unfortunately, the DVD won't work on my DVD player (which all other DVDs play on).  My DVD player and my computer say it is ""unreadable"".  Maybe not made for USA?  I gave the product 2 stars, as I did receive a DVD, that isn't new and it doesn't play.  So 2 is the best I can give the item.  I'm going to return it, if the shipping costs are not prohibitive.  I have already spent $$ on DVD and shipping.  Very disappointed.",1381795200,2,556,4.188679245283019
