5402406,4,B00AAA62TI,"You might like this movie if you enjoyed:
The Amityville Horror (1979/2005), The Shining (1980), Insidious (2010)

Long Story Short: In this movie based on true events we get to know the Perron Family, that moves in a new home and experiences horrific events due to spirits living in their house. They seek the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren, so called demonologist specializing in ghosts and spiritual activities.

Review: For weeks I have been so obsessed about this movie that I actually read plenty of reviews and watched interviews, which built up my expectations too high I guess. Judging by what everyone else has said, I was expecting to be at the edge of my seat, biting on my finger nails, occasionally covering my eyes, maybe even scream out loud. But that was not the case. Nonetheless I did enjoy The Conjuring, because it doesn't rely on over-the top gore effects or people jumping out of a dark corner, as a matter of fact certain scenes actually make your heart beat faster just because you think something is going to happen, and then... nothing. But then you don't expect it, and it happens. The cast was terrific. Vera Fermiga is a very charismatic actress, I would almost say like a young Meryl Streep, and she brought life into this movie, but so did Patrick Wilson. And let's not forget about Lily Taylor, who definitely needs more roles.
If you have seen Insidious you will definitely find similarities as far as the shock moments go. James Wan is a great director, who knows how to create an atmospheric horror thriller with great cinematography. His secret is to use his own fears to create the mood of the movie (see interview below).

Rating: 3.5/5

5402407,3,B00AAA62TI,"I saw this movie opening night on July 19th 2013 - - and for the most part, I thought it was pretty good actually.  ""Horror movies"", in general, have always seemed to have been the toughest flicks to make - - and really good horror movies are so few and far that it's not even funny !

So are movies that are made that involve children, and child acting - - those can also be very challenging to make as well. But overall, I think the children in this movie do a great job with in their roles.

THE POSITIVES:  This movie had tenseness throughtout, and the fright moments seemed to build slowly but steadily.  The movie had many great ""things that go bump"" sounds and moments (I especially liked the hand clap game)throughout the movie that amounted to great lead-in's for the climax of the bizarre exorcism (Linda Blair would have puked and chucked green vomit with a devilish smile seeing this, and would have been proud of this scene - as a nice job was done here !)  Nice ""creeky old house"" with classic squeeky doors throughout.  And every creepy haunted house needs the youngest daughter and the creepy paranormal entity to have a wonderful working ""new best friends"" relationship with one another. And this one worked well.  The guy who played the cop was neurotically good - - playing a classic country bumpkin and comedic ""Billy-Bob lawdog"" !

THE NEGATIVES:  I found both leading women (Vera Farmiga and Lily Taylor) a bit ""over-the-top"" in their roles - Vera with her paranormal husband, and Lily with her husband and family.  Both women seemed to have more than a few ""wide-eyed and euphorically-crazed"" smile moments  - - for a couple of these moments, I was waiting for little blue robins to start flying and circling their heads while dousing even more love, tenderness and bliss onto them ! Seriously, a few scenes got so stupid that I was expecting to see Lassie come running out with his heart-warming theme song playing during some of these overly dramatic scenes ! But no doubt the worst cheese moment was the 15-minute ""group hug"" by the family at the end of the movie....just really cornball !

What is clear here, however, is the movie itself was GOOD - - it just makes me cringe that it could have been BETTER....and I mean, so MUCH better !!!!",1374278400,6,2268,4.584158415841584
5402408,5,B00AAA62TI,"I'm wondering if it is possible to un-see a movie...JUST JOKING!

First of all, Anyone who claims that this movie did not scare them...is LYING! I will call them a liar to their faces because it is indeed scary. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone pregnant (my sister is almost 9 months and I told her not to go), or anyone who has a heart condition. Secondly, this movie is not for children unless you want them sleeping in your bed for the rest of their lives. I realize some people may think that I am exaggerating, but when I went to go see it, this movie had 300lb grown men leaving ""going to the bathroom."" I lie to you not people, this movie is a complete nightmare. Forget about every scary movie that you've seen in the 21st century because they won't even come close to this. Saw was gory (not scary) and Insidious moves really slow, and it doesn't pick up to me until about 45 minutes into the movie, but when it did I liked it even though a lot of people didn't. The Paranormal Activity Movies were creepy, but not scary, and frankly they moved really slowly too in my opinion.

Third, this movie doesn't play around; it jumps right into the scares from the very beginning, so you will not be bored or disappointed I promise you. I expected a regular horror movie, nothing really special, and I felt like the trailers were just snippets of the best parts of the movie, but the movie itself was probably going to be mediocre at best. I was WRONG! Those screams are real. When I left the theater, I felt like I needed to recite the LORD'S PRAYER and SEVERAL HAIL MARY'S! I do not scare easily, but this movie not only scared the crap out of me, and I swear I started having heart palpitations right there in the theater. This movie is not about a regular haunted house, possession, or any of the other vastly overused plots they use now days. There is something for everyone, and it plays on your worst fears.

1. Scared of the dark...check!
2. Scared of enclosed spaces...check!
3. Scared of ghosts, spirits, and demons...check!
4. Scared of the things that go bump in the night...check!
5. Scared of any harm coming to your children...check!
6. Scared of being trapped with nowhere else to go...check!
7. Scared of creepy dolls and cursed objects...check!
8. Scared of things jumping out at you; right in your face...check!
9. Scared of old haunted houses...check!
10. Scared of Satan worship, human sacrifice, and witches...check!
11. Scared of demonic possession or becoming a prisoner in your own body...check!
12. Scared of the basement...check!

I really can't say what parts of this movie are true, and what parts were embellished in order to make a great movie, but whatever the case I have a newfound respect for Ed and Lorraine Warren. I was already familiar with some of their work because I used to watch the T.V. show ""A Haunting"" faithfully, and they were on quite a bit of those episodes, and I knew they also investigated the Amityville Horror. With that said, this was the worst, and I can see why they kept it hidden all these years. That family was lucky to have them. I really don't want to weigh my review down with a whole lot of the plot which ruins the entire experience, so all I have left to say is....watch at your own risk!

Lastly, I really have to add this because I read where some people thought certain scenes were ""cheesy"" but it was those so-called ""cheesy"" moments that made the movie even better to me. It's no secret that the demons want to destroy a strong family by using the divide and conquer method to tear apart their unity. Once the vessel that the entity seeks to inhabit becomes so isolated, and broken down, it makes the possession that much easier. There are few mothers and fathers who won't fight practically anything or anybody for their children, and they had 5, so they had to be 5 times as strong to face that evil. The same thing with the Warrens, a husband and wife unit is a powerful thing. They both needed to be there to support one another, and if it's so easy for one partner to abandon the other in their darkest hours. What does that say about their faith, strength, and unity as a couple? Lorraine did the right thing by standing at her husband's side no matter what. I realize those concepts may seem foreign and outdated to some, but those types of relationships still exist in the world. This demon was relentless, and had even started stalking the Warrens' daughter for that matter. They had to finish what they started, or should I say got themselves involved in. Allowing the characters to remember those cherished moments it's what ultimately saves all of them in the end. I thought those parts were lovely.",1374192000,6,4689,4.524764150943396
5402409,5,B00AAA62TI,"Gut wrenching, beautifully filmed and perfectly paced, THE CONJURING isn't just one of the best supernatural chillers of recent years - it truly deserves a place next to ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Innocents"" and ""Poltergeist"" as one of the more memorable cinematic excursions into the paranormal ever produced. That may sound like high praise, but walking out of director James Wan's stunning thriller, I was hard pressed to think of other horror movies that have captivated me from start to end as much as this one did.

Chad and Carey Hayes' screenplay takes the true story of a Rhode Island family's haunting in the early `70s and embellishes it into a film that grips you from its earliest frames, while Wan - the director who single-handedly launched a decades worth of gory ""torture porn"" pictures with the original ""Saw"" - here demonstrates a far greater command of the screen with what many have already called a directorial tour de force. In fact, Wan utilizes a documentary-styled approach that's closer to William Friedkin's 1973 classic than any other supernatural film I can recall, and expertly works with John R. Leonetti's cinematography and a masterful sound design to create one of the more brilliantly directed pictures this genre has seen in years.

The Perron family - led by parents Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston - move into their home in northern Rhode Island and quickly notice standbys of any film haunting: bumps in the night, unseen forces that cause their dog to bark, and an occasional chill that permeates the air. Their five young daughters, though, are quickly put into the crosshair of a supernatural entity that wants more than to just make its presence known, physically announcing itself by grabbing the girls and causing bruises to Taylor that she believes are just the result of an iron deficiency. Ultimately, the Perrons call in paranormal experts Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson), the earliest ""Ghost Hunters,"" who soon realize the family isn't suffering from a noisy oil burner on its last legs causing a ruckus.

""The Conjuring"" carries an R rating but the film's violence is minimal and its profanity nearly non-existent. Wan eschews the gratuitousness of his past works in favor of a less is more approach that's just as scary for what you don't see as what you do (particularly when young Andrea Perron first encounters a ghost, standing in the corner of her room but only visible to her - not the audience). At first, it might be easy to resist the movie's familiar structure, but as the story unfolds, it's nearly impossible not to get wrapped up in the family's plight as the supernatural occurrences increase. The effectiveness is all due to Wan's direction and the uniformly believable performances of Taylor, Fermiga and Wilson, not to mention the unaffected young actresses playing the tormented Perron girls. Yet even with all the chilling moments, you come to care about these people, and the emotional catharsis that closes the picture is something few films in this genre have been able to duplicate (kudos to Joseph Bishara for a moody, effective score as well, with Mark Isham contributing a poignant ""family theme"" that plays a significant role in the film's concluding moments).

""The Conjuring"" is at a disadvantage compared to other films in its genre because it's had to follow classic films like ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""Poltergeist."" For viewers resistant to horror films in general, there's probably little here they haven't seen before, and one could argue the more explicitly visceral elements of the haunting are its weakest asset. Nevertheless, Wan's movie grabs you and doesn't let go until the credits have rolled - and even then, you might be checking the rear view mirror, just to make sure nothing's followed you home. That's frightful filmmaking at its finest, and ""The Conjuring"" is unquestionably the most effective cinematic haunt of this generation.",1374105600,226,3960,5.041221374045802
5402410,5,B00AAA62TI,"It's remarkable that in a genre expressly designed to scare people, so few of its entries actually accomplish that goal. But The Conjuring absolutely does. Smarter and more consistent than all of the Paranormal Activity films put together, James Wan's interim project between Insidious installments exudes both studio respectability and grindhouse urgency.

All of which is why hyperbole aside, The Conjuring is the closest thing to a horror classic modern audiences are likely to get, particularly in an era when genre offerings seem to be at their most disposable.

Ron Livingston (Dinner For Schmucks) and Lily Taylor (Being Flynn) play Roger and Carolyn Perron, parents of a quartet of girls who move into a Rhode Island farmhouse only to quickly discover that it's possessed by supernatural forces. After exhausting all possibilities of dealing with the unseen menace, Roger reaches out to Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), well-known paranormal researchers who have a reputation for eliminating similar threats. But even the veteran investigators begin to think they may be in over their heads after the evil force initiates increasingly violent attacks on the Perrons, forcing them to confront their own painful past as they try to help Roger and Carolyn preserve their family's future.

Although it certainly utilizes many of the hallmarks of other recent paranormal, possession-oriented movies in order to exert its influence on the audience, The Conjuring succeeds for three reasons which might not seem obvious except in comparison to their absence in those predecessors. The first of these is the fact that it's consistent: from the film's opening scenes to its finale, something is always happening. In the Paranormal Activity films, for example, much time is devoted to introducing the characters and then feebly attempting to justify the constant use of cameras in every corner of the house. In Wan's film, the first scene highlights the Warrens' expertise with a ""case study"" featuring a particularly creepy doll, and the last resolves the escalation of supernatural activity that takes place in the Perrons' home. And in between, virtually every passing day and night features at least one frightening moment, often repeated in just a delicate enough way that it both keeps the threat palpable while allowing space for it to evolve or intensify.

Secondarily, what happens to the Perrons happens to all of them. In far too many horror movies, one character will find him- or herself persistently attacked by some evil force, only for no one else around him or her to see it. As a result much of the film's running time is spent questioning whether or not anything is truly happening. In The Conjuring, the supernatural force essentially goes after anyone and everyone in the Perron family indiscriminately, creating unpredictability --and maybe more importantly, a collective acceptance that this is occurring --that keeps the characters and the audience on edge.

Third, the film (or the characters) makes almost no stupid decisions, which is a rarity in a film of any sort these days, but is exceptional in a horror film where, as a byproduct of poor writing or maybe just storytelling necessity, they seem to occur with maddening frequency. In fact, there's a completeness to Wan's vision here that seems to preclude even the possibility of stupidity: the characters take rational steps to explore and address the supernatural problem. The movie gives them the credit of being blindsided by this evil force rather than having them more or less submit themselves to scenarios where scary stuff occurs. And once the investigators join the Perrons in the house, they set up cameras and recording devices in every corner. This creates a sort of first-generation found footage movie within a movie, and eliminates the ""nobody believes me"" argument from the characters' usual repertoire of excuses why their problems continue to intensify.

Wan's interest in making an old-fashioned studio horror film pays off handsomely, because it showcases both the creativity that he developed on independent and low-budget projects and the refinement and maturity he achieved while making those movies. While the movie doesn't skimp on gruesome imagery of ghastly figures and evil spirits, some of its greatest moments of suspense occur while little girls are peering, terrified, into dark corners of their bedrooms where there seems to be no one at all. This sort of expert audience manipulation doesn't come purely from scrimping and saving and working within budgetary constraints that prohibit the filmmakers from showing their monsters. It comes from truly understanding what is scary and how to maximize that suspense,with or without the money to show the monster that will eventually invade viewers' nightmares.

Evidently, The Conjuring is based on case files of the real Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also investigated the house that would become the setting of the iconic `70s horror film The Amityville Horror. I can't speak to the film's accuracy in depicting the events in question, and I generally speaking have no sense of spirituality to bounce off of the events in the film. But there are things in Wan's film that, for the sake of me sleeping soundly, I'd prefer never to see again. The Conjuring creates such an intense and consistent atmosphere of suspense that I would give it my highest recommendations, and yet it's something I will probably never watch again.

That said, it's not perfect; the ""case study"" footage at the beginning, for example, is assembled half as a collection of clinical interviews and half as a mini-horror movie. A later return to that storyline --inside the Warrens' house while Ed attempts to stage an impromptu exorcism at the Perrons' pays off in terror, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense logistically. And some of the finale in the Perrons' house unfolds more like Evil Dead than a bona fide demonic possession, whatever that would perhaps more plausibly look like. But in a movie where shadows are as scary as the most detailed monster make-up, these shortcomings are few and far between. That Wan shows, say, only an incidental shot of the hanging feet of a past victim instead of a ghastly close-up of the entire corpse is a testament to his restraint, and his growing sophistication, as one of the industry's top purveyors of legitimate and long-lasting scares.

The greatest transition that Wan has made since the beginning of his career is one fundamental to the growth of the genre as a whole: moving away from the graphic brutality that was a staple of so much of the past decade's horror movies towards something more emotionally resonant. By ""emotionally resonant,"" that doesn't necessarily mean that Wan is attempting to leave long-lasting, deep-rooted emotional damage as a result of scaring his audience. Rather, it refers to his ability to maximize those viewers' willingness to give themselves over to the experience of watching something, caring about characters and story, and coming out feeling as if there was some effect exerted upon their lives other than rank disgust. Although it was certainly effective (and the best in the series), Saw was a showcase for inflicting pain, contextualized as a series of moral dilemmas. This film chronicles the considerably more relatable struggle for one family to achieve the American dream challenged by an otherworldly threat.

Of course, Wan's latest isn't the first horror film to explore that idea, or even the first since his Saw days to do so. But The Conjuring is probably the best, certainly in a long time. Thoughtful where its competition is glib, featuring substantive and relatable characters, and steadily-paced where most feel lackadaisical, rushed or uneven, Wan has made a truly great movie. And I'm only talking about the parts that I saw from between my fingers.",1374105600,,7922,5.153188180404355

5402412,5,B00AAA62TI,"I saw this picture the last 9th in the Nocturna festival in Madrid and I loved it.

Despite I'm a big fan of horror films I didn't like too much the previous director's film Insidious, neither the last horror films released in the last years (except Drag me to hell or Sinister maybe). But when I saw this film the other day it reminded me why I loved this kind of films.

The only negative point to me could be the conventional of the plot, but in the positive side the technical aspect is great, the sound, photography, direction. Also it has no stupid characters or silly scares, and it has several very tense and creepy scenes.

Almost everything works in this very enjoyable film, so I recomend to all of you who love horror films like the classic ones.",1370908800,22,758,4.4

Amazing movie from start to finish and I think it's safe to say The Conjuring establishes the new standard for true horror in this day and age, leaving gore/slasher horror aside this film brings back and captures perfectly the good old haunted house style of film and executes its tension building and scares like no other modern movie.

James Wan is actually a GOOD DIRECTOR FIRST and then a horror director second. He prioritizes good acting, getting good and creepy cinematography, and actually having a good plot. The choice to go with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga for Ed and Lorraine Wilson was also a great decision. Terrific actors who are believable in their roles.

The make believe Ed and Lorraine Warren just makes this sack of crap even worse and offers it a false authenticity.  The smell of rotten meat could indicate demonic activity?  Check the garbage disposal first.  Maybe there are rats dying in the walls.  I only watched this because some website I ran across put in on the list of ""Best Horror Movies Of All Time.""  Not feeling horrified here.  Despite all of the current fol-de-rol, there are really only two things you need to know to locate restless spirits -- cold air, and a medium who doesn't have his or her head up their ass. The cold air results because the entities need energy to manifest, so they take energy out of warm air and leave it cold.  If this movie scares you, I hate to have to tell you this, but you are pretty wimpy.  I did enjoy the slamming on the walls, kids being dragged across the floor, and tinkling music box Poltergeist moments, although the Lorraine/Mom Poltergeist moments are pretty lame.  Then, of course, we have the Exorcist moments aimed at the little girl -- how very original.

This movie is not scary - try Poltergeist for a well produced ""ghost"" story.

I keep the lamp next to a photo collection of my deceased father. You can imagine that I had a hard time sleeping afterwards. As for the movie, there were many scary parts, anyone that said it wasn't scary is crazy. The tree scene alone did me in.

Two hours later having gotten through it, I confess that the Conjuring is a fine example of what can happen when a tired genre is placed in respectful, recitative hands. Director James Wan is clearly more concerned with telling a well-structured story than pandering to audiences with gore and computer-generated special effects. It is by no means an extraordinary work, but Wan makes an appreciable effort to make a good film that enhances the genre instead of, as is the case with many of his contemporaries, diminishes it.",1499472000,,738,5.008130081300813

5402531,1,B00AAA62TI,"One of worst horror movies I've seen. Does that seem hyperbolic? Let me explain...
It opens with some jarringly speedy exposition about the doll Annabelle, rattled off by three girls who are, ironically, more lifeless than said doll. They are being interviewed by Ed and Lorraine Ghostbuster, two paranormal researchers who try to outdo the girls by talking like they're on an outtake of Law and Order. It's actually incredible how bad they are; they're so unnatural, so shamelessly forced, that I couldn't believe it was real. I thought it was a Tropic Thunder-esque parody of terrible horror exposition; nothing about the set up works in any way.  It succeeds in establishing no tone, no pacing,  no anything except that the doll is possessed, ooga booga. This didn't need to be dictated to us, you could trust in the viewer to understand as the movie goes on and the danger makes itself apparent, and perhaps even build a little suspense. So this introduction is not only clumsy, but pointless. Even if the rest of the movie was a masterpiece, this introduction is so baffling and aimless and quick that it's like a slap that knocks you off balance.  In hindsight, it perfectly complements the rest of the movie.
Cut to present day, early 70s, and its starts with one of the most standard horror cliches ever: ""we just moved into this new house and it's haunted.""  I know this is based on a true story, but could you not make this so predictable that it's numbing?  It's treated like every single movie you've ever seen, so basic and so artless in it's execution that it's painful.
You can guess the entire movie from here on out given this information: house freaks family out, they call the ghostbusting couple, they realize it's the doll (surprise!), possessions take place, big happy Hallmark ending with crying and smiling.  How about some more specific forehead-slappers.
1. Sideburns. Apparently James Wan's makeup and clothing department believes that the key to transporting you to a time period is the most laughably generic stereotypical styles slapped on everything and everyone. Bell bottoms are 70s, right? Put em in!  The only black guy must have an afro, it's canon. And good Christ, the sideburns. Every single male character seems to have them, giant blatant fuzzy cheek worms that do not match the hairstyles in any way. After the eighth guy stepped out of a car with them waving in the breeze, I laughed out loud. They just can't be serious with this, it's absurd.  While you're at it, why not give everyone a Led Zeppelin shirt and have them smoke pot for breakfast? I'd love to see James Wan cover other  eras in history: the 50s? Everyone is Elvis or a housewife with rubber gloves.  The 90s? Everyone is on a skateboard and listens to Nirvana.  The Renaissance? Everyone wears powdered wigs and pantaloons.
2. The jumpscares are atrocious.  Most of the movie is doors closing suddenly, I kid you not.  It's so repetitive and predictable that I just started staring at every open door on screen; the movie takes every chance it can to spook you out with doors. The only other jumpscares (there are three or for, if I remember correctly) are so desperately bad that they have to jack the volume up to unrealistically high levels. The movie is trying so hard to get you, it's hard not to feel sorry for it and give it a pity-jump.  In one repeated ""scare"", a kid's leg is pulled while they're sleeping.  When you're stealing your scares from Paranormal Activity, you know you're desperate.  Whenever the leg gets pulled (it happens at least two separate times, because it's that frightening), a bassy WHOOM sounds off.  Once again, the leg-pulling has been seen so much, even in YouTube videos, that they try to force the fear on you with sound effects. That's all their millions of dollars being put to good use, right? The best one is around the middle of this endurance test of a film, in which a witch-woman leaps off a dresser at the children.  I can't do justice to how silly it is,  just look it up and prepare your chuckle box.  The last one (worth mentioning) is a bunch of pictures falling off the walls and shattering; so it's basically a Scooby Doo cartoon at this point.  The memorable thing about it is just how deafening the sound designers chose to make the glass breaking. It's louder than a skyscraper having all its windows blown out at the same time.  The movie's desperation is so comical you can practically see the beads of sweat standing out from the screen.
3. Nobody is likeable or memorable in the slightest.  I'm not good with names on my best day, but good god these characters are written with such a lack of investment that I would characterize them by their goofy cartoonish appearances, but since they ALL look like that it's still difficult to tell them apart.  The dad is just nothing, he's a black hole of character.  He just walks and stares.  The ""main"" character is either Ed or the mother, and wow, is the mom a tool.  Before she gets possessed by Annabelle and turns into Creepy Screaming Woman, she is a bug-eyed piece of flatbread who scurries around the house essentially being the camera to expose the viewer to creeptastic stuff!  Our daughters are acting so strange, don't you think? There even a slapstick moment where one of the girls gets dragged back and forth in the living room by her hair until someone gets scissors and cuts it, brilliant thinking, it's not like the ghost could grab anything else.  You have foiled the ghoul with scissors.  Ed basically exists, like I mentioned before, to Law and Order some serious expository quaznit on us poor dumb viewers.  He talks about the ""clear"" signs of ghost infestation in the same way the Ghost Adventures crew or Finding Bigfoot team does. He makes tracking ghosts an art, because my god, he's never seen a case like this one.
I'd be more amazed at this movie's open-armed reception if I didn't know what was up: because it's an alleged ""homage"" to 70s horror, that makes it different than, say, Paranormal Activities or any teen slasher flick.  Except that even if it was a well-done homage and not a sloppily constructed mess of embarrassing cliches and predictability, it still wouldn't automatically be a good movie.  That takes effort, that takes a team of people not banking on the gullibility of ignorant modern moviegoers to sell them something ""above"" the standard army if horror films that come out every year.  This isn't above anything, it's a facade.  It's a layering of cringeworthy superficial 70s stylings over the same old story and jump scares that pass for the bottom of the barrel horror shorts you can see on YouTube.  The Conjuring, to me, stands as a shining example to the excesses of Hollywood on horror: indie horror in recent years has shown that an extravagant budget will never replace the good storytelling, genuine creepiness, and sense of fun that is truly valuable when making a film in this genre.  This movie is a flaccid beacon to the misuse of a big budget in filmmaking, but also to how much that budget seems to mean to contemporary audiences.  You are missing the point.",1494720000,,7138,4.712791633145615
5402532,4,B00AAA62TI,"I like movies that are based on a true story.  I live in New England so there seem to be plenty of haunted house movies based on places near me.  The movie was interesting enough to prompt me to do more research.  I'm never quite sure if these stories have more to do with haunted houses or haunted families, but in any case, I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.",1494288000,,371,4.125

5402539,5,B00AAA62TI,"The key thing to remember when watching the Conjuring films is that the center is always the relationship between the Warrens.  They determine what happens and what doesn't.  This makes them distinctive in the horror genre.  The gore and violence is scarcely here.  In its place is well-thought creepiness and possession.  The movie makes a point of grounding itself in reality.  You soon learn why that ghastly tree is present on the cover and what its connection is to everything else.  This is intelligent, story-driven horror.  And while the omnipresent Catholic element may be over-the-top, the producers and writers prevent it from becoming the whole story.  And, of course, with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as leads, well, there is little to disappoint.  This little film proved to be a box office bonanza and made Conjuring:2 happen.  Let us all hope that the relationship between the Warrens remains the center on which all other sequels base themselves.",1491955200,5,967,5.095541401273885

5402541,4,B00AAA62TI,"James Wan is one of the most promising modern horror film directors and with The Conjuring the bar is set high with a full spectrum of talent on display. A triumphant exercise in atmospheric dread, the first hour of the film is flawless, with taut pacing and masterful scares. The biographical nature of the film adds to its credibility, rendering the tale somewhat plausible even for the most skeptical of audiences. The only sequences that shatter the illusion is when the filmmakers opt for painfully obvious digital effects. Cg bedsheets anyone?

Blu Ray Review (1 disc)


A Life in Demonology (16min) - An interesting overview of the career of the Warrens.
The Conjuring: Face-to-Face with Terror (7min) - The real Perron family are interviewed. Creepy stuff.
Scaring the '@$*%' Out of You (8min) -  James Wan talks about his techniques for scaring audiences.",1491782400,,864,5.020979020979021

Scary movies are all right but once they start down that cerebral staircase they begin to lose me and that's too bad - especially since this one had so many high marks for it on Amazon.

I will say that I'm periodically forced to watched the occasional paranormal/ghost story/haunted house reality programs that my partner likes but unlike her, I do not believe all the crap that anyone says about the paranormal - especially when they do not show any repeatable visual evidence of ghosts or telekinetic activities.

Although, just to nitpick, I will say that I like the DVD's cover art better than this (the DVD has the house and noose, which I think is cooler, but it doesn't really matter).

This movie is amazing! I'm someone who watches horror movies year-round. It's been a long time since a movie actually scared me, and The Conjuring absolutely delivers. I'm sure you all know the situation where something is hyped up to you and praised and praised and then doesn't live up to expectations when you see it yourself. Well, The Conjuring not only lives up to its reputation, it exceeds it! Definitely worth having on your shelf. I'd suggest getting a Blu-ray so you can watch it even when the internet's out!",1482019200,,819,4.609589041095891

This turns into a cheesy Catholic vs demon story. Very choppy. Characters not interesting. Then the final straw- the person who must be exorcised.

5402697,3,B00AAA62TI,"I've come to really love the actor Patrick Wilson as a modern everyman in the Henry Fonda/Tom Hanks mold, wonderfully confirmed in the second season of Fargo.  The acting is good throughout this movie.

But as with his Insidious, which I liked, and Insidious 2, which I couldn't finish, I find James Wan's direction merely carefully competent rather than compelling.  I'm a big fan of possession stories - I just rebought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostage-to-the-Devil-The-Possession-and-Exorcism-of-Five-Contemporary-Americans/dp/B00BOQGF80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans</a>&nbsp;-- but I need them to surprise.  Instead, I found here repeated tropes from Insidious:

1.  The spirit will follow, so why bother leaving
2.  Kids in peril (John Saul, anyone?)
3.  The medium/ghosthunters

There's a lot of repetition here if you're trying to follow these extremely well-reviewed series.  I didn't find anything out of the three movies mentioned surprising.  They just seemed to do their thing and wrap themselves up.

There were good moments.  And I liked that they took so long to come; all these movies took time to build, and atmosphere is everything in real horror.  This is real horror, not just shock schlock.  I'm happy and even relieved to see it, what with the focus on simple torture, slasher stuff, and general voyeuristic misery that has all but buried regular horror these past decades.

If you want something traditional rather than some creep with a knife or a video camera setting up misery scenarios, you'll probably find this movie and the Insidious series a relief and pretty welcome. But if you want to be surprised, you probably won't get it here.  You can look away or take a few minutes off at any time and not miss much.  Things unfold the way you'd expect, and then you're done.  They aren't bad movies.  They're just movies done by someone who probably has the talent to do more but just didn't.",1479340800,,2046,5.394321766561514

5402700,4,B00AAA62TI,"Normally never ""creeped"" out by the horror genre. However, this twist on the haunted house theme is very effective. Many of the action devices, i.e., sensing a presence, one individual seeing a ghost in the shadows that others can't see, creaky doors, a spooky basement, a family pet found dead, the old childhood fear of lying in bed in the dark with something pulling at your let etc. really create a sense of dread.

Plenty scary and suspenseful -- and they addressed the question you ask yourself during every movie with a haunting: #NoSpoilers ""Why don't you just leave the house?""

And c) if they don't obtain proof the church will not perform an exorcism.  Only complaint: ring contact lenses and airbrushed skin is not scary (anymore - ""The Exorcist"" was terrifying in its day) I can see people who believe in haunting/possession losing their minds watching this - I've got an open mind but I haven't been scared of poltergeists since I was a kid (and watched ""Poltergeist""!)

5402778,3,B00AAA62TI,"The film obviously is a hit with the younger generation. We old folks will constantly recognize all the classic scary movies this film liberally borrows from. You'll get a Poltergeist vibe, an Amityville Haunting flashback, The Exorcist, The Birds, Chucky, even the Friday the 13th TV series. (C'mon, surely I'm not the only person who remembers the Friday the 13th TV series and all those cursed objects they had to put in the vault?)

The story follows real-life ghostbusters Ed and Lorraine Warren, whose horrific wallpaper in their home is enough to keep any demons at bay. They come to the aid of a poor family who can somehow still afford a huge house. There's just a tad bit of fake blood used but otherwise there's no real gore.

5402794,5,B00AAA62TI,"Development for The Conjuring began over 20 years ago when Ed Warren played a tape of Lorraine's original interview with Carolyn Perron for producer Tony DeRosa-Grund. They made a recording of Warren playing back the tape and of their subsequent discussion which became the basis for the film, which they titled the Warren Files. The title makes more sense but isn't as dramatic, this film is but one story about Ed & Lorraine's hundreds of investigations.

[Mild Spoiler Alert] The central premise of the film is that innocent women accused and executed in the Salem witch trials ""actually were witches, who slaughtered children and pledged their love to Satan,"" and has been described by critics as ""reprehensible"". Every modern documentary about the Salem witch trials has as its basis that witchcraft is a fantasy belief created by white men in power to oppress women - i.e. there is no such things as witches, no such thing as black magic, etc. And while that is the accepted historical analysis that witches and magic never existed, there are stories like that in The Conjuring from that period.

Plenty of modern day wiccans and others have stated that witchcraft is real, that its not evil, and that there are also evil people who historically have practiced black magic. They also believe as the historians do that the witch trials were largely fabricated but add that its based on instances of ""real"" witches. These were oppressed women ""guilty"" of things like trying to sink the ship of an occupying king by summoning a storm, etc. There is a lot of missing context in these tales, and while The Conjuring doesn't provide a ton of such details it goes further than most such films in providing an occult explanation.

Still the film does unintentionally further the narrative that the thousands of women killed in the witch trials probably deserved it, by portraying a women who kills her child not as insane, but as the definition of a witch making a pact with the devil.",1476144000,,1983,4.843657817109144

5402803,4,B00AAA62TI,"This movie was alright for me I think it gets allot of hype because it's based off the Warren's. There's allot of creepy stuff in it fair amount of jump scares, really Christy and some ghosts.  The thing that I find absolutely amazing about it is the directors filmography and costume, you really feel transported back to the seventies which is probably something that will make this film stand the test of time.  It's also got allot of sub plot in dealing with the love the Warren's share fir each other and their good christian nature (which I'm not really into Christy things but if you are hey bonus). It's ultimately more then just a horror, and I like that, but if these attributes are what you're looking for in horror go for it.",1475798400,,736,4.485074626865671

The film was beautifully shot, and the story was captivating. While the final pay-off for the full story of the ghost is a little hokey, the amount of time the viewer spent without reasons for the spooks added to the tension and suspense in the movie.

5402879,4,B00AAA62TI,"Now this is what you call HORROR!!! 

***Spoiler Alert***

A couple moves into a dilapidated house. They have five daughters, Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog Sadie, refuses to enter the house. While playing hide and seek, one of the girls stumbles across a cellar. It was boarded up - why do people not watch out for signs - there is a reason for that board being hammered there!

Weird things start happening - all the clocks stop at 3:07am, Sadie is found dead, the spirit tells Christine that it wants her family dead. The mother, Carolyne seeks the help of Ed and Lorraine - they are renowned demonoligists and they agree to take on the case. Lorraine has a few demons herself.

Ed and Lorraine investigate the house and they conclude that the house needs a exorcism but they need confirmation from the church first. I promise you that after watching this, I felt like I needed an exorcist -_-

It keeps you at the edge of your seat, gripping suspense, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - overall, it is worth your money!",1473033600,,1051,4.654054054054054

It was scary, sometimes due to genuine fright, but also because of some over-scoring (deep base blasts and such).  I wish the movie-makers had had faith in their material more and let the fright come out more naturally.  I am sure the movie suffered because I had watched the Exorcist a couple days before, but no matter.  So watch it if you want to be frightened, but don't expect a great movie.",1472947200,,496,4.52808988764045

5402908,5,B00AAA62TI,"Amazon seems like an odd place to leave a film review, but sure, why not. The Conjuring is not only my favorite horror film, but is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a well-made, genuinely scary, yet positively uplifting story. It scares the poop out of you for like two hours, then blasts you in the face with an emotional resolution that has yet to not make me cry. I get goosebumps just thinking about it. The Hayes brothers are Christians and it contains a number of religious themes, but doesn't rely on them as a crutch or try to sell to the religious crowd. The writing is fantastic, the scares get you, the acting sells it, the directing is engaging, the soundtrack suits perfectly. It's not just a great horror movie; it's a great movie all around. It's rated R with zero sexual content, profanity, or drug use, and very little violence. It got its R rating purely for the horror. This one definitely belongs in your film collection.",1472083200,,952,4.508670520231214

5402993,5,B00AAA62TI,"One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It was scary without depending on jump scares, and the film allows you to become attached to the characters.",1469318400,,154,4.535714285714286
5402994,5,B00AAA62TI,"James Wan is one of my favorite directors. I watched this before finding out he was part of the production and loved it. Great cast, decent script and a good, true to its heritage take on the classic American style of horror films.",1469318400,,231,4.395348837209302
5402995,1,B00AAA62TI,I could have turned the movie off ten minutes before it ended and not cared what I missed. I'm generally a big fan of horror sci-fi movies but this one is highly over-rated. They introduce a scary clown doll that has nothing to do with the story. None of the characters behave logically. The story is a bit of a mess and I didn't care about a single character. I jumped a few times but not in response to anything exciting. Any director can make you jump by flashing a monster face and sounding a big bang.,1469318400,,506,4.22680412371134

5403055,5,B00AAA62TI,James Wan definitely knows what he is doing. This movie is extremely suspenseful but without the typical parlor tricks of other movies in this genre. The story is handled artistically and the acting is second to none. I recently saw the Conjuring 2 at the theater and was equally impressed. I will continue to see any movie James Wan directs. He is definitely the Alfred Hitchcock of today.,1468540800,,390,4.75

I hated it (which equals to one star) because it scared the bejeezus out of me at 4:00 in the afternoon and this grown man is not ashamed to admit that!

The director seemed to have wanted to avoid those predictable moments that you see in many horror movies, and he succeeded in doing that I think in The Conjuring. Supposedly, it's based on a true story based on a family who move into a house haunted by a nasty demon that then targets the family. I know many movies claim they're based on a true story and not sure if it's true with this one, but it didn't matter to me, I enjoyed it either way. Now excuse me while I go watch it a third time! :)",1466812800,,602,4.198275862068965

5403180,5,B00AAA62TI,"The oversized Annabelle doll an instrument of evil pounds at the victims' door looming large over their lives. Once locked within a cabinet at the Warren's house (exorcists of evil spirits) Annabelle still presents as a threat and the genie in the bottle determined to escape.

The main story begins as the classic haunted house with a Stephen King flavour. The family move into their aged and stately home on a mild sunny day fuelled by optimism. The dog instantly senses evil, is dispensed of without mercy - found dead the next morning. On their first night the girls play hide and seek initially unaware of the shadows of evil that engulf them one by one. The evil spirits pursue and terrorise each family member before the Warrens appear to exorcise them from the house. The vengeful spirits initially singles out one child, befriends another and seem to drain the life from the mother. Horror cranks up several notches before the family retreat in fear into a front room of the house.

As the Warrens confront the cruellest and most mocking spirit it fastens its grip on the mother propelling the Warrens to embark on a tense and daring attack on the spirit to save the mother's soul as it undertakes full possession of her. Away from home the Annabelle doll is emboldened and intent on breaking out of the confines of the Warren's garret containing the doll and other evil objects. Even more frightening is that this tale is true. As the Warren's show great courage and imperil their lives to save the family trapped in their home by evil this alone increases the chill factor - knowing that the haunting is real.",1466812800,,1620,4.700704225352113

If they had been significantly more neutral on the subject of religion and the ""based on a true story"" crap, it would have been a lot more entertaining.

The scares are slow to start and when they do finally kick in, it feels very forced at times.  For a movie that is based on a true story and seemingly trying to take itself a bit more seriously than the average fright film, there are too many moments where my wife and I were baffled by the proceedings of various events and characters.  But for what it is worth, my wife was still genuinely freaked out by the movie, so I guess it is creepy to some.",1466035200,,563,4.233644859813084

All horror films are basically the same, the stories just differ, so I suppose it is just getting harder and harder to come up with new twist and turns in the journeys on the way to the end of the ride. This one, however, was good, even though it was the same basic tale of ""family moves to a new place, new place has bad juju, new place is cleansed, and all is well with the world. Same story, but It held my attention a little more than the rest of them. It was well done, and the cast did a great job.

Is not super cheesy.
Great combination of shock-factor and cringe-factor.
Really great angles and shots that only add to the anxiety/fear (not what you would expect from a typical horror movie).
Attention to detail that greatly adds to a fairly well-developed plot (welcomed plot twists throughout).",1464566400,3,351,5.4

5403434,3,B00AAA62TI,"I don't mind suspending my disbelief in the supernatural for a good scary movie. But this wasn't much in the way of scary. It was at least creepy, though. And in good ways- despite the ridiculous script.
We know how the whole ""based on a true story"" drill goes, right? We all know that they change things in movies, yes? And that changes are even expected today and allowed and all that?
So if you have the opportunity to change stuff- why not drop in a line somewhere that talks about how crappy it was that people murdered women as witches. And maybe we could do that instead of pretending that it is acceptable for someone living in this day and age to perpetuate the notion that victims of the Salem trials can still be regarded as evil devil women.
Maybe as long as an artistic license is in play, we could possibly mention that the only thing that could bring a woman to kill her own child then *or* today would be mental illness. The women that were condemned to death in Salem and other places were just women. Just people with families that they loved. Just women with horrifyingly nasty neighbors and community members that allowed their own superstitious hysterics force the hanging or burning of innocent people.
Why not mention that instead of writing asinine lines that equate infanticide as a satanic merit badge? Ug. The ghostly voice saying ""Look what she made me doooooo"" was a turn off.
Okay I'm off my soap box.
The writing is truly pathetic, but it is worth a rental if you can ignore the cave-dude Hayes Brothers momentarily- for the acting. I'm always a Lili Taylor fan, and she doesn't disappoint.
Vera Farmiga and Ron Livingston carry the movie though. Farmiga was wardrobed into something of a puritan caricature, but she keels and swoons her way into a wonderful weirdness. Somehow, Livingston performs everything ""sideburns first"" and it's almost a parody, almost a laugh riot- but it is still okay. He still comes across as believable and you can take him seriously, even with his rather extreme beliefs and extreme sideburns. (That's more than can be said for the real Mr. Warren, anyway.)
Wang's direction keeps it in the genre of horror instead of comedy. And it satisfies the basic expectations of a a horror movie, despite the distractions.
It is a good basic scary movie, without an ounce of originality. The five teen and pre-teen girls (probably never once played Light as a Feather Stiff as a Board of course) could have slept with their covers on their feet. We all know that this has a guards and wards effect of being fully protected. But no. They left their little-girl ankles and piddies without covers or bed sheets- which hello! Exposes you to the evil demonic forces of darkness, people!! So.... the only thing to do in that situation would be to lean over the edge of the bed and look under it, of course.
And then their bedroom door moves and there's a shadow? Or maybe something else?
Awesome. Creepy. Great stuff. I mean, okay- this was the stuff that I scared the sheeot outta myself with when I was a kid. But what it lacks in originality is made up for with primal basics, I think. Get the popcorn out for a rental night, folks!",1464480000,,3181,4.602112676056338
5403435,5,B00AAA62TI,"Based on the files of the Warrens (Ed and Lorraine), this movie is a good scare. From scenes that literally make you jump, to the illusions that are downright cool. I recommend it if you want a good spook flick.",1464480000,,211,4.3

5403542,2,B00AAA62TI,"Very not scary. Annabelle is a gateway for a malevolent entity that is terrorizing two nurses. One thing I appreciated about this little sub-story is the fact that this is one of the case files the Warrens discuss at their seminars. While the doll wasn't as creepy in real life (it was a Raggedy Ann doll), the story did pretty much follow the case file they presented at the seminar. This added to the luster of the film for me. Having previous information from the seminar gave me a little different take. Due to the disheartening state of world affairs, it is all too easy to find videos from Mexico, Iraq, Syria etc - seeing real humans being decapitated, dismembered, disfigured etc after ten years of seeing such traumatic footage I could only manage just under an hour of this film (I left at the sleep walking/wardrobe/ lady above it) scene.
I guess I always doubted the power of horror movies, but this dingdong 'gave me the not too scared willies"" My top scary movie of the last five years would probably be Sinister. I know a lot of people rip on that film, but I felt it was legitimately creepy. It had your standard jump sequences, but the movie did it in a way that was actually scary. You see a movie called Lawn Work and you see a lawn mower and you just cringe at that. You know whats coming and you cant help but cringe at it. Its disturbing and creepy. It really nailed that atmosphere.
The Conjuring was good, but it just felt kind of plain-Jane.",1458864000,,1466,4.433333333333334

Also, there is a scene in the movie near the tree when the ghostbusters name Mary Esty as the spirit whom is haunting the house.  If their referring to the Mary Esty who was hung for whitchcraft during the Salem witch trials, you know it's bogus.  There could be another Mary they're referring to but the coincidence is just a little too convenient.

5403592,4,B00AAA62TI,This was a decent movie about paranormal. I have heard of the couple as I am big into the paranormal and I have seen them on some of the Paranormal shows etc just like most. What I did not like about the movie was that it is so wrong I lost respect for this couple because of the movie. I have to admit yes it may be strewn because it is a movie but the information that they put out there about witches bothers me a lot. The sign on the door to the artifacts speaking about be careful the items were used in Witchcraft and the whole thing about this witch swearing her soul to Satan and killing her child. Really? I mean that is pure ignorance period. Witches or Wiccans do not believe in Satan that is a Christian deity and they can keep him. And they do not perform sacrifice let alone their own children. This bothers me because there is so much misconception about this earth based religion that it is ridiculous. I find it offensive that the movie or the couple would promote this ignorance and yes I get it Hollywood has done it forever but still this couple has their name on this and she is even in the movie herself so that leads me to believe they are misguided.

5403595,2,B00AAA62TI,"Lorraine and Ed Warren gave a lecture at my university in the late 1970's. I was fascinated by their story and  their work. They talked in great deal about the demon-possessed doll ANNABELLE, who is referenced a great deal in THE CONJURING so I knew I had to see this movie. I saw the cast, a good mix of well-known but not super famous actors who usually do a great job.
We've seen this story so many times before. A family, usually short on money, moves in to a new home that seemed to be sold for fractions of its value. Soon, they learn the home is haunted but not by harmless mischievous spirits but rather demons. This time it is the Perron family moving into a crumbling old house to start a new life.  Of course, THE CONJURING is said to be based on a real haunting, as in the AMITYVILLE HORROR.
As the family now feels physically threatened, they seek out the help of demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren. Armed with their demon and ghost hunting cameras and records, the Warrens come to a startling conclusion. This is no ordinary haunting.
Unfortunately, THE CONJOURING comes across as a run of the mill low budget B horror movie despite a more than decent cast. The effects are standard and fairly unimpressive. It was a chore to watch this film despite an interesting premise.
Although Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor do a great job as Lorraine Warren and Carolyn Perron, THE CONJURING is a an all-around disappointing film. So much potential was lost here. The effects are bland and boring on all levels. The make-up seems to have come from a discount shop. Nothing is appealing in this film. Although this film seems to have a lot of fans, I am sadly not one of them despite my high expectations before seeing the film.

As an added note: I bought the Blu-ray version. Although it does not say it on the package, it was a combo pack. It had the DVD and Blu-ray. By chance I watched the DVD and there was only one feature on the making of the film and its scary effects. I checked and the extras are on the Blu-ray. They were actually worth watching. I wish they had been longer. The Perron family reunites for the mini documentary on their experiences in the haunted house. A LIFE IN DEMONOLOGY tells the story of the Warrens.

5403610,5,B00AAA62TI,"One of the finest and scariest horror films made in decades. It doesn't matter if the film was based on a true story, neither here nor there this is a smart horror film. James Wan gets back to basics on using minimal special effects , little soundtrack or back ground noise and choosing a cast we actually care about. The hand claps are brilliant and selecting silence to gain effect instead of trying to sell us a soundtrack. WELL DONE!!!

remote.  I bought the movie with my butt lol and it's Fabulous. This movie scared the Charles Dickens right out of me. I seem to be jumping every at least 2 minutes once the movie picked up, & I had to pause it because my heart was beating just a little too fast. So for horror fans I really think you're going to love this. So if you ever accidentally by Amazon digital movie with your butt It's a sign from the Amazon fire Gods to watch the movie and just enjoy it. Heck put your remote right now on your couch and sit on it and see if it'll purchase this movie right now, and if not then of course use your hands. Thanks ;-)",1454112000,,896,4.033707865168539

5403645,4,B00AAA62TI,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars] Maybe it was all the hype.  I finally got around to watching ""The Conjuring"" and must say it was generally good, definitely above average, and worth your time, though not in the elite group of the best horror movies, like ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Shining,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" (original), ""The Birds,"" ""The Omen"" (original), ""Carrie"" (original), or ""Poltergeist"" (original).  Even ""The Amityville Horror"" (original) left more of an indelible horror impression.  As an example, ""The Shining"" had all the makings of nightmares for the viewer, but I slept like a baby just after I saw ""The Conjuring,"" forgetting the scary parts soon thereafter.  ""The Conjuring"" also definitely took a backseat to ""Poltergeist"" (original, 1982), which had something that ""The Conjuring"" didn't have:  An element of fun within the horror, as odd as that may sound (there's nothing wrong with an incognito sense of humor).  ""Poltergeist"" also had enumerable memorable and/or scary scenes, like Jobeth Williams sliding back into the backyard pool after she thought she was almost out, the odd arrangement of the chairs in the kitchen, Carol Anne sliding across the floor, the tree busting through the window and almost seeming human when grabbing the son, the piece of steak on the counter moving on its own, the paranormal investigator in the bathroom when the light bulb malfunctions, Jobeth crawling on the ceiling, the never-ending hallway, the sequences of the entrance to the closet and its exit (especially when it transformed itself into a monster head when Craig T. Nelson tried to pull the rope too soon), the house collapsing into nothing, etc., while ""The Conjuring"" had, well, mostly just a generalized moderately but convincingly scary aura.  It was also disappointing to read that ""The Conjuring"" may not be based on a true story after all, just on unverifiable accounts from the real-life family (interestingly, ""Poltergeist"" never claimed to be true yet was decidedly superior to ""The Conjuring"").  Ron Livingston (""Office Space"") was also an interesting casting choice as the father, and while his performance was confident and formidable, I kept expecting him to crack some deadpan joke.  Still, it was apparent that the objective of ""The Conjuring"" was to please sometimes hard-to-impress horror fans while simultaneously fulfilling a thinking person's horror-fan standards.",1451692800,,2405,5.307894736842106
5403646,5,B00AAA62TI,Loved this movie!! It was one of my favorites!!,1451260800,,47,4.333333333333333
5403647,4,B00AAA62TI,"Based (loosely, I suspect) on a haunting investigated by real-life paranormal investigators Ed & Lorraine Warren whose body of work also inspired the Amityville Horror; this stock supernatural horror starts in the usual manner with a 1970s (not a mobile phone in sight  hoorah!)  family moving into a dilapidated and isolated farmhouse. Not surprisingly the building is home to an unquiet spirit and many a dark secret.

Much spookiness ensues. [Very mild spoiler alert] The dog refuses to enter the house and there is, of course, a creepy doll, a boarded-up cellar and even a secret passage but this film is rescued from the corny clich it could have become by some excellent performances, a decent script, bags of atmosphere and masterful management of pace & tension with plenty of jumps. Every box on the standard supernatural horror checklist is ticked and it really works rather well; it may not be startlingly original but it does exactly what it set out to do. It doesnt quite rank up there with The Grudge on the scare-ometer (which scares me silly for some reason) but it is definitely worth 9/10.",1451174400,,1107,4.877659574468085
5403648,3,B00AAA62TI,"There is something undeniably creepy about a doll that won't stay where you put it, and the opening of the Conjuring was chilling as a result.  There's no question why the doll, Annabelle, got her own movie.  But she was only a minor part of this one.  Even without her, the first part of this moving -- perhaps the first three quarters, was good and scary.  If you want a good scare, this is a good movie.

But I also like my movies to make sense, and the last quarter of the movie lost me.  It was like watching the Avengers fight all those little Ultron robots.  At some point, watching the Avengers destroy another wave of robots got old.  That's what happened to me in this movie.  The special effects just kept coming and grew less believable.  As a result, they no longer packed the punch that the earlier chills provided.  And -- without giving anything away -- the last quarter of the movie simply didn't make sense.

However, lots of people rated this 5 stars, so they must not be as hard to please as I am.  I'm sure you could do worse than this movie.",1451088000,,1063,4.308080808080808

Allot of ghost and possession movies leave important facts out or maybe the writer didn't think stuff like that was important, just wants to scare you but folks, I think, want SOME backstory so they can appreciate what's going on.

5403702,2,B00AAA62TI,"I enjoyed the movie, not because it was scary, but because it was funny. The scene with the ""possessed"" girl flying around the floor of the house while her family tried to catch her reminded me of how we try to catch our puppy when he has someone's slipper. Also, the movie borrows heavily from other movies, such as The Exorcist, etc. The exorcism performed in The Conjuring, again, seemed funny to me. The secular ""priest"" tries to read from his exorcism book while the father of the girl screams religious blasphemies at the demon inside of his daughter...yet the demon seems to respond to this religious treatment? Excuse me? And the couple who perform the exorcism live in a house that has a basement full of ""possessed"" possessions from previous exorcisms? Of course, the teenage girl in that house wants to go exploring in the basement. Very predictable. I think that the movie would have been a lot better if that mischievous girl had, instead, during her parents' absence, sold off the weird possessed possessions in a yard sale to raise some gas money. Now, watching all of those local folks drag home their ""treasures"" and dealing with them would have made for a good howl! Maybe The Conjuring would consider that for Part II. All in all, I didn't find the movie very scary. Our local 10:00 O'Clock local news is a lot scarier than this flick. Watch it and laugh.",1447027200,2,1374,4.658436213991769

5403734,4,B00AAA62TI,"First off, I do not believe there is enough scientific evidence to prove the existence of demons and evil spirits capable of infiltrating homes and bodies to induce the blender to spontaneously make milk shakes or stimulate hall clocks to reset themselves to a particular time. So I view The Conjuring as a great story, inspired by and loosely based upon a real case study of a ""haunted house"" which Lorraine and Ed Warren investigated and eventually interpreted as demonic possession. (Their other famous case, the so-called Amityville Horror has been under much dispute and scrutiny since their original investigation, which may have been an elaborate hoax.)

Without having done any background research, I hypothesize much of the events as depicted in The Conjuring were exaggerated for dramatic affect. If you can put aside the idea that this is a ""true"" story, there is much to enjoy for supernatural horror film buffs. Carefully timed scenes make you jump from your chair, similar to ""The Shining"", which is something I haven't experienced in a horror film of this sort since ""The Sixth Sense"". Also, the film is not too ""bloody"" but relies more on its scare tactics.

The story is loosely based upon the real-life investigation by the Warren's of a house owned by an American family, the Perron's, in the early 1970's. The film begins with one of the Warren's other cases, the so-called Annabelle doll case, before cutting to one of their lectures on paranormal investigations at a university. The main story thread focuses on The Perron's, a married couple and their five daughters, who move into a house in the countryside in New England. Almost from the beginning, they experience some strange occurrences in their house. The first tip-off is an incident with their dog, who doesn't wish to enter the house. Then creaking doors, strange knockings, and glimpses of apparitions terrorize the family at night, which also fosters the somnambulism (i.e. sleepwalking) of one of the daughters.

When the house becomes nearly unlivable because of the nightly disruptions, the mother Carolyn Perron (Lilli Taylor in an absolutely convincing performance) tracks down the Warren's. They agree to investigate employing a combination of ESP on the part of Lorraine Warren and technological tools via cameras and tape recorders. As they continue to learn more about not only the recent history of the disturbances, they learn the history of the house which tells many secrets. In particular, two supernatural centers for the unrest are unused basement filled with antique furniture and an old tree near the creek slightly away from the house.

While I don't think the Conjuring should be taken seriously as a true-to-life story, it's a horror-fest roller coaster ride. The directing and camera work create the perfect balance of frights, suspense and horror to keep you watching to the next door creaking, relieved when the ""thing"" appears then vanishes. The supernatural malevolence is only gradually revealed, as it should be, until the final denouement. As a horror film, it works well and deserves a place alongside some of the other films of its type, such The Exorcist (still the best film in this genre), and Poltergeist. Simultaneously, is this really how the incidents unfolded in real life? I doubt it.",1446508800,4,3309,5.088397790055248

I thought it was ""top-shelf"" horror but instead it belongs somewhere on the middle-shelf. It borrowed from other titles too much and some of the lines were a little over-done in terms of trying to be creepy or scare the viewer. (No spoilers, but what a little girl says in particular when they pick her up after being frightened comes to mind.)

5403801,1,B00AAA62TI,"I'm sorry, but this film is a rehash of ""The BIrds,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Ring,"" ""Poltergeist,"" and of course ""The Exorcist,"" all great horror films that sand on their own, but this one was so full of cliche, and so unoriginal, I just couldn't take it.  The acting from Ron Livingston, was some of the worst I've ever seen.  He reminded me of his frustrated character in ""Office Space"" too much.  I preferred him much better in ""Band of Brothers.""  This movie was so cliched, it was actually quite funny in parts, and oh yes, all dolls are evil, Chucky will tell you that.

I guess I'm just so sick of the same ghoulish makeup that every scary ghost must have, and the unoriginal ideas, and quest for suspense/scary music at every turn.  Snooze.",1444608000,2,739,4.518796992481203

Other than that, this is your average run of the mill film trying to exploit the haunted house/excorsism theme. If you've seen every movie out there and love haunted house themes, go ahead and rent it. For me, I don't watch movies that often and was hoping for a REALLY good one.

5403832,5,B00AAA62TI,"As a big fan of movies and horror movies specifically, there have been a lot of disappointing horror films in the past few years.  Many of them relied on cheap jump scares, while others have resorted to excessive gore to make their audiences squirm in their seats.  I had heard a lot of positive things about The Conjuring before seeing it, so I'll admit my expectations were high.  This can almost be a death sentence for a film, as expectations have a lot to do with how satisfied you are after viewing!  Surprisingly, my expectations were surpassed.

Even though the trailer gave away some of the scary moments in the movie, there were plenty of additional ones we weren't expecting, which kept us on the edge of our seats.  Throughout the final 3rd act, the suspense was constant, as was the action and guessing games as to how everything would turn out.  After it was all over, we were shocked at the lack of foul language and lack of character deaths.  Shocked in a good way.  The fact that this movie was suspenseful, intense, and scary almost throughout, without resorting to cheap tactics says a lot about how much thought and effort was put into crafting the film.

If you are a fan of horror movies or even movies in general, I highly recommend The Conjuring.  In a world where we're moving to digital and streaming movies, this was one I knew I HAD to own on Blu-Ray, simply because I was planning on watching it many more times in the future.",1443398400,,1455,4.515267175572519

There is a dog which is the family pet, she dies a miserable death. Why is this so often the case with modern horror movies? Any true master of the horror craft can make a decent horror movie without slaughtering the pets and/or random wild creatures (this movie murders both), but for some reason modern horror movie makers feel like they haven't done their job unless they kill off some innocent non-human creatures along the way. I watched the preview several times to make sure there was no pet in this, but the preview lies and doesn't tell you that there's a dog that they're going to kill.

Extremely scary, with overtones of the Exorcist and a reality show with none of the cheese.  This film did not shy away from the aspect of demon possession or unearthly happenings, and I like that they did not apologize for their explanations or their beliefs.  The cinematography was fantastic and I would recommend it to any horror fan, even though there was none of the usual blatant blood and gore.

I have personally experienced a few of the things this family went through, and it nearly drove me insane. Luckily I had a family member who is a devout Christian and who helped me on few occasions. I did not believe in demonic possession per se but the things that happened to me personally made me change my mind. These things are real and I challenge anyone to believe otherwise. I made a mistake by inviting an entity into my home in pure daylight during Easter week and luckily--actually blessedly--I was able to fight it and get some measure of relief. I am extremely careful about NOT interacting with these things and warn anyone who cares to listen to do the same. It--they--will follow you and will not let go until you find someone who is able to help.

5403923,5,B00AAA62TI,"Let's get this straight. Not every Horror Movie is going to scare everyone. Even great one's like this. I watched it and thought it was the scariest movie I have ever seen, thought it was a little repetitive and some parts could've been better. But all in all a great movie. But my friend saw it and didn't even think it was scary. We all get scared differently. Whether it's Jump Scares or Creepy demons looking at you from afar, it's different for everyone. This movie will be scary for some and for others, not at all. It all depends on how they get scared, what type of mood they are in and the setting they are in. Everyone's different and will experience it differently.
As far as the Movie goes, it's great! It actually has a story to go along with it and it's not like usual horror movies where they just focus on Jump Scares and Gore. This builds suspense throughout the whole movie. I thought their was no point that it just ""died"". It was a great Horror Movie throughout and it wasn't rushed.",1438041600,,1003,4.3689839572192515

The most interesting performance was Lili Taylor as Carolyn, who was supposedly possessed by a demon.  Taylor played this part with a hint of ambiguity, as if the putative possession might actually be an expression of something coming from within her own consciousness.  Or that's how I read it.  I think it may be that Taylor is a better actress than the film deserves.",1437264000,,456,4.580246913580247

5403943,4,B00AAA62TI,"very good movie, I know some say un original and a rip off of other horror movies but seriously its horror, I am not watching a new horror film expecting to experience a ground breaking new genre of terror. Almost every horror film made copied another horror film. So yes its not ground breaking but it is entertaining and that's why I spent money on it, to be entertained. The scares are somewhat similar to movies like it. example Sinister and the newer Amityville. A lot of fixed camera shots with low light creepy music and then something jumps out type of scare. The acting is better then most would expect for this type of film and the story is compelling. The things that would have made this movie better would be as if it kept the whole true story part out, and leave the Warrens names out of it. Sorry I am a fan of the two as far as story telling goes  but the taking there word for truth is kind of hard for me to do. In conclusion its not the most original, factual, or scary movie out there. I know some reviews say it is but if you purchase this expecting the scariest film in recent years you might be disappointed. What this film is. It's entertaining and a bit scary/ exciting with good acting and does what a scary movie is suppose to do....",1436745600,,1260,4.2719665271966525

5403951,2,B00AAA62TI,"Fitting that the film has a retro 1970s setting (which is quite convincing and visually appealing), because it really brings nothing new to the demonic possession / exorcism sub-genre. Comparisons to the fear factor of ""The Exorcist"" are, er... sacrilegious. Not a bad flick, but certainly not as scary or innovative as the hype suggests. The primary story also suffers from the production's efforts to embed the sequel, and the result is that it loses focus on just who is the protagonist. For my money, ""The Last Exoricsm"" would be a better use of a couple hours.",1436400000,,565,4.835051546391752

I see complaints about the ""based on a true story."" People please keep in mind all that means is that the storyline has some vague resemblance to an actual event (or alleged event).  So there being scenes in the movie that aren't true or didn't occur doesn't violate that.  I've heard of Ed & Lorraine Warren - and am skeptical about their credibility if for no other reason that they claim the Amityville Horror is a real haunting and I've seen a pretty convincing debunking of that - but that didn't take away from the movie for me.

Yes you've seen that same plot over and again since the 70's but that one is well retold here. This one throws in a couple (one of who is Norman Bates' mother from the Bates Motel), who usually debunk haunted houses as a leaky pipe or something, realising pretty much as soon as they enter that the evil is real in this house.

Let me start by saying I did enjoy this movie. It has some really scary and creepy scenes, which are a lot of fun to watch alone in the dark and get creeped out. But toward the end of the movie, it started pulling way too many of the cliche's out of the hat. The worst and most obvious was the exorcism concept being re-hashed. It really adds nothing new in 2015, and kinda kills the movie for me. The plot is also quite lacking in background, story, and substance. I guess if you don't mind the same cliche stories, you'll enjoy the scares. There was even a cheesy ""fight the ghost with happy thoughts"" scene. Really???

The camera work and scenes were really well done and very well directed. The actors were great too. I did enjoy this movie, but don't listen to the other reviews that say it's the greatest horror movie of our time. It's not. It's just fun and scary.",1431043200,,980,4.320652173913044

5404129,1,B00AAA62TI,"It is alleged, as was ""The Exorcist"" that ""The Conjuring"" is based on a true story.
Indeed.
A pastoral counsellor (a lutheran minister) famillar with the actual events upon which ""The Exorcist"" was based confirmed to me that the realities of the case were greatly embellished and, in fact, bore little resemblence to either the novel or the film. In the words of Eberneezer Scrooge, there was more gravy than grave in the tale. And yet the screenplay was adroitly and cleverly crafted with  realistic characters and a coherent plot.

""The Conjuring"" is completely devoid of both. It is an unimiginative tale, stacked with cliches poached from at least three or four more creative predecessors. There is a malevolent doll cast in the mold of Chuckie from ""Child's Play""; the high-tech ghostbusters we first saw in ""Poltergeist"" with their state-of-the-art demon tracking gadgetry (as well as the persecuted Brady Bunch family we saw in the Spielberg classic), the obligatory yacking of vomitous when the demon is exorcized, a brief redux of Hitchcock's vicious birds, and worst of all a long string of extraordinary phenomenon that happen without any semblence of cause and effect. The sum of these parts, or perhaps the engine that drives them is a script that seems as if it could have been written in a few hours.

Where ""The Conjuring"" fails dismally is in its dramatic arc. I would suggest you could change the order of numerous scenes and the movie would not suffer at all. THAT is the sign of a poorly conceived script. The slow and metriculous set up for the credibility straining events of the ""Exorcist"" is what makes it work. ""The Conjuring"" lacks that pacing and dives right into events in a manner lacking even the slightest cohesiveness. The result is a movie that cannot possibly, in any way, suggest it was based on a true story. Even if we accept demonic possesion as a real-world phenomenon, life simply does not work as it is depicted in ""The Conjuring"". The incredible happens but it is still the result of a logical chain of cause and effect. As I suggested, things happen in ""The Conjuring"" simply becasue they happen"".

I could elaborate further on the other grievous omissions of this film but I'll cite just one: we cannot feel any compassion for the family that has been tormented by the resident demon. There was real emotion between Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blaire in ""The Exorcist"" . We get none of that--or very little in ""The Conjuring"". Every film should have a heart, or, a soul. ""The Conjuring"" has neither. It has cheap thrills for the easily frightened but since these thrills are built upon cliches, they have a short half life. Linda Blaire sleepwalking into a a room where her mother is entertaining friends, staring catatonically at an astronaut, and saying ""You will die up there"" while she urinates in her sleep"" packs a whallop and is scene that stays with you for years.

The best punch that ""The Conjuring"" can throw doesn't even leave a welt--unless your idea of horror needs countless screams behind locked doors that cannot be breached, a half a dozen descents through cobwebs into a haunted basement, and kids tossed around by unssen entities like wrestlers in the WWA.

""The Exorcist"" left me believing for awhile in the theological possibility of demonic possession. ""The Conjuring"" just leaves me.",1430611200,14,3347,4.863157894736842

5404233,4,B00AAA62TI,"Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga) are demonologist whom wrap up a case involving a doll named Annabelle that is used as a conduit for a demonic spirit. The two are called back into action when a family of seven purchases a house ruled by a very evil and powerful spirit that they accidently unleash. -summary

I feel ashamed to say that The Conjuring is a horror film that I put off since its 2013 debut. The reason for this is simple; I refused to buy into the hype due to being swindled numerous times into believing my time was going to be well invested, instead only to want that precious time back for something productive like cleaning my house. This time I can honestly say that the majority in favor of this movie is right, as director James Wan not only managed to craft a truly terrifying horror movie that I believe everyone should see and own, but easily one of the best pure horror movies in the last ten years since its release.

The Conjuring is a near perfect haunted house horror film that dabbles in demonic possession and witchcraft. The plot follows The Warrens as they interview the family, research, and try to combat this evil threat. The film does borrow from films of the past and uses techniques that many would feel to be clich. However, the lack of originality in these things does not lessen their devastating punch. One of the films many attributes contributing to its greatness is definitely the pacing. Wan spends just enough time developing this loveable family for the viewer to feel for them; then suddenly the tormenting begins and it all occurs at a well timed pace. The little noises such as slamming doors, hand claps, are done with precise precision as not to be over played. These things are joined by really clever camera tricks and great use of lighting creating uneasy shadowy effects to help stimulate the viewer's imagination and bringing them into this world.

It's near impossible to talk about this film without further going into how the chills and scares are handled. It's quickly established that this family is up against a mischievous and wicked spirit. Wan sees to it these people are even harassed in their sleep using some of the simplest scare tactics to large effect; perhaps the biggest reason why this approach works is because these are things we can relate to. I'm sure many people make sure to cover their feet in bed, because they believe something will grab them. This movie will see to it that some folks go back to doing it after growing out of it.

The family whom are terrorized are the Perrons, and I have to give credit to them for their believable roles, because bad acting would have ruined some of the stand out moments. Joey Lynn King playing one of the daughters by the name of Christine was indeed convincing in her role; but Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson were the heart and soul of this ordeal, as they were given enough proper background and motivation to help this family. This is among the most memorable batch of characters for me in a horror film.

I must also mention that Wan does not skip on keeping the story interesting in the least. The threat in the house is examined in an interesting enough way. To include he also did his homework on delving into the key elements in recognizing witchcraft, such as the negative reaction towards dogs especially and the rotten, decaying like smell.

While the film did hold my attention from start to finish with the right amount of tension. It definitely suffered its share of flaws. I found the last few minutes to be kind of shaky, and I really didn't see the point or like the Annabelle doll coming into play in any form. It felt a bit too forced and at least for me created a rather puzzling question I'll leave alone. It really didn't serve a purpose outside of more creepiness, but the story paid for it a little.

In closing, with its strong cast of characters, well paced plot delivering perfectly timed scares and tension; The Conjuring is something that shouldn't be missed and I recommend it to movie watchers in general. The lack of nudity, low profanity, and extremely low amount of gore makes this film something pretty much anyone can enjoy.

Pros: Strong characters, right amount and well timed frights, great atmosphere

Cons: Small plot missteps",1427673600,,4314,4.650918635170604

I'd also add that the sound effects really took center stage in this film and made it as scary as it was.  I do wish they'd do away with the ""based on a true story"" angle though; it's just become such a hokey gimmick.  If you're a hardcore horror fan--which I am not-- The Conjuring should score at least an average rating.  I can only handle a horror film once and awhile because I do scare easy.

I now like more of the haunting/suspenseful horror movies. Even after seeing this a couple of times, it can still make me jump when watching it with the lights out.

I was disappointed with how they handled  Annabelle, I didn't like the look of the doll or how far they went away from what actually happened.  It's Hollywood, I get it but it is creepy, there are scary moments but I feel it's a one time watch, you maybe different and feel it's the better than what I say and that's totally cool.  What ruined it for me is I knew about all this before they made a movie, I've been a fan or Ed and Lorraine Warren since I was in Middle School, so I've read most of their books and I don't feel it adapted well to the screen, if it was titled something else and had no affiliation with their work it would be a phenomenal horror movie!:)",1424563200,,733,4.069444444444445

I like to hear my friends and family feedback on the movie so I can decide whether the movie is worth watching. I was really surprised how many people said The Conjuring was a good movie especially for a Horror/Scary movie. The reason I say this is because most of these scary movies that come out are terrible and are not really scary. Anyways back to the topic, I went to see The Conjuring with my younger brother and sister. And I actually liked the movie and I thought it was somewhat scary.  I did jump a few times in the movies and even gasped. I actually laughed as well on a few scenes especially when the little girl was banging her head on the closet dresser door. The fact that this is based on a true story is beyond crazy. You can also guess and figure why certain things happen such as:

(Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert)

They showed the little girl keep sleep walking to the closet dresser and keeping banging her head against it, you know that there is something in there that the evil spirit is trying to show them.",1420416000,,1131,4.3254716981132075

5404489,4,B00AAA62TI,"This is a very good horror movie even for those who are not fans of horror movies. The acting is very good all around, the writing is great, and it is based on a true story. Whether you believe a house could really be haunted or not, this story is based on events that happened in 1971 when a family moved into a farm house. Strange happenings drove them to seek the help of the Warrens, a couple who investigated many cases of paranormal activity, including the inspiration for ""Amityville Horror"".

If you are not big into horror movies with lots of gore (which I'm not), don't worry, this has virtually none. Here the director of movies such as ""Saw"" brings his ability to scare an audience without depending on lots of blood and gore. I would not say it was very scary, though there were moments that will make almost anyone jump. They do a decent job of building up to the scares rather than piling them on; however, this also results in the movie being somewhat predicable at times. All that being said, if you prefer movies such as ""Saw"" and expect horror movies with lots of gore and/or scares at every turn, you will be disappointed here.

I found some of the extras on the discs very interesting. They included interviews with the real Lorraine Warren, members of the Perron family about whom the movie is based, and actual paranormal investigators.

5404512,5,B00AAA62TI,"This movie didn't really scare me to pieces (which takes a lot), but it was still pretty good.  I hate horror movies where the horror revolves around gore and plot is just what takes you from one death scene to another and this movie did a really good job of building spookiness.

As you watch, you get wrapped up in the family and the growing dread that surrounded them.  Instead of just jumping right in to the in-your-face monsters and ghosts, it started off slower with bad smells and shadows and feet getting yanked in the middle of the night and figures that some girls can see and others can't.  All things that people could try to ignore in favor of finding an everyday cause for what was going on...until it was too late and they had face the nasty spirit that had become glommed onto their family.

The basic plot revolves around the Perrons, including a mom, a dad, and their five daughters in the year 1971.  They seem pretty down on their luck as their dad can't even fix up their old car and they have invested their last money into getting this old farmhouse.  First off, they find the basement has been boarded up and, pretty soon, odd things start happening.  (This is one of the quibbles with the show--why didn't they check out the furnace before buying the house or, barring that, why didn't they look for it right away, as one would think knowing if the heating worked would be a good idea?)  Their youngest finds an old toy that, if you stare in the revolving mirror on it, you can see her new invisible playmate.  Another girl begins sleepwalking again, trying to get into an old wardrobe by banging her head against it.  The mother wakes up with new bruises every morning.  Their dog refuses to come into the house.  They all play this ""clapping"" hide and seek kind of game and, pretty soon, someone (something) else starts playing it with them.

Finally, it gets so bad that they go looking for the Warrens, a husband and wife team of self-proclaimed ""demonologists"" who videotape their work and give lectures and have a whole room in their house filled with haunted and demonic objects.  (Another quibble, despite getting a priest to bless the protections on these objects, why have them around where their young daughter can get into them?  This carries over from the beginning of the movie where we meet Annabelle, a haunted doll and, apparently, the lead in to another movie--all of which really could have been left out.)

Once the Warrens show up with their crew to take videos and record the troubles so they can get the Church to come in and exorcise the home, the trouble really begins...and the scare becomes much more in your face.  Which is where they began to lose me, because other movies have done possession and exorcisms before and the plot seemed to take a down turn after it began delving into that rather than the more subtle ghostly aspects.  The nasty spirits you can see are never as scary as those your mind can create given just a few clues and a lot of shadows.

Even so, this is a  pretty good horror movie and would be great for Halloween viewing (after the kids have gone to bed).  I have no idea how much is supposed to be based off a ""true"" story, but its well worth watching if you like a good scare.  There's not a lot of gore in the movie and not really any sex, so its more of a good old fashioned spooky movie.",1414972800,,3371,4.454397394136808

5404531,5,B00AAA62TI,"The movie The Conjuring uses the strong elements that make up a great horror movie to transform a typical storyline into a terrifying and memorable movie. The Conjuring uses the amount of scares, an interesting plot, and strong characters to drive the story and strike fear into the hearts of the viewers. The Conjuring is about of large family of seven who movie into a house in Rhode Island looking for a fresh start at life. Weird and unexplainable things start to occur so the family enlists the help of the famous demonologists named the Warrens to figure out what is going on.
  The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about a good horror movie is the amount of scares or shocks that the movie provides. The Conjuring provides not only temporary scares but also scares that keep you looking over your shoulder long after the movie is over. The story starts off slowly with small scares such as pictures falling off walls, clocks stopping at the same time every night, and of course the appearance of random bruises on a couple members of the family. As the movie develops and mysteries starts to unravel, we start to get a bombardment of larger scares, one after the other, that keep us on the edge of our seat. Larger scares such as the reveal of the ghost, an incident with the demon possessed doll Annabelle, and the final fight between the humans and the demon.
  As important as scares are to a horror movie, there is something that is just as important, the plot. A lot of horror movie lately are so focused on the scares that sometimes they forget that plot is also an important element in a horror movie. Of course scares are extremely important, people watch horror movies to be scared, but even the best scares become boring if the plot of the movie is uninteresting. The plot of The Conjuring is a typical one with a twist. The movie begins as an average haunted house but also thrown into the mix are exorcisms, witches, and dolls coming to life. Bilge Ebiri, a critic from New York Magazine/Vulture points out, Wan [the director], who gave us the first Saw and Insidious, has been trafficking in old-school horror motifs for a while: ventriloquists dummies, possessed dolls, dark cellars, childrens drawings of red faced demons  he knows a good, workable horror clich when he sees it. With all of these different elements you would think that the film would be a confusing mess, but these elements work together in a way that compliments each other and makes this one of the scariest movies that has come out in a long time.
  Scares and a good plot would be nothing without the existence of good characters. It is easy to become disinterested in horror movie characters after the third, I told you not to go into that dark basement alone! It has long been understood that the characters in horror movies do not make the best life decisions, but luckily the characters in The Conjuring do not make us give up on them. It is easy to genuinely care about the family in the movie and to hope for them to make it out of this situation alive. As Manohla Dargis, critic from The New York Times points out, Theyre appealingly real, with an easy intimacy thats strikingly different from the canned version briefly seen in a clip from The Brady Bunch. This familys struggle to adapt to their new environment and the stress from their financial situation puts them in a relatable position for many people, which adds toward the amount of supporters cheering this family on with their fight against the supernatural.
  The amount of scares, an interesting plot, and characters that demand sympathy are all important elements in a good horror movie. The Conjuring proves that scary movies can succeed without massive amounts of gore and pointless story-lines. It is a genuinely scary movie that keeps you on an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film with scares at every corner. It is a must-see for all horror movie fans. Also, as a warning to horror movie beginners who think they should skip all the other horror movies and go straight to The Conjuring, you might want to watch this with the lights on.",1414627200,,4127,4.6735537190082646

5404550,4,B00AAA62TI,"I'm not normally a fan of horror/thriller movies, but I watched this in preparation to go see Anabelle with a friend.  This movie was actually done very well I thought.  They have a very good base story line with a few other subplots that all get a decent amount of screen time such that everything fits together very well and none of the story threads feel like they're just left unfinished.

I will admit that this movie made me jump twice, and that is not easy to do.  For me that means you have to give me a story that is interesting enough that I quit trying to pay attention to whats going on in favor of following the story and trying to put myself in the character's shoes.  And as far as the ""lets go down in the dark basement by ourselves with no light where we just heard a strange noise"" scenarios go, (which are something that I really dislike in movies), this movie doesn't really have them.  In fact, there is one moment early on in the movie that almost seems like a nod to this or poking fun at this where one of the characters starts to go into the dark basement by himself, goes down like two steps, then stops and ask for a box of matches.  While not a whole lot better, this at least made me feel like the character was TRYING to think before he acted...",1414368000,2,1275,4.200819672131147

Oh, yeah..then there's the part where the possessed mom ( who's tied to a chair ) gets lifted off the ground by spirits and the chair is stood on the ceiling ( so the mom's head is pointing toward the ground ).....so what does the guy performing the exorcism say to the spirits? ""DROP HER NOW!"" HAHAHA..... Sure. SMASH HER SKULL! I found myself talking back to the screen A La ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". I laughed so much during this film I got a pain in my side.

This was a entertaining show, and weaved so much truth with error regarding demonic possession, I first wondered why, then it was made clear. It made a couple statements referring to the children in the house needing to be baptized, then to top it off a bachelor priest from the cult of Catholicism said an exorcism could not be done because the family was not part of THEIR church..lol. Which in the real world is a good thing. It goes back to a corrupt Greek text in the 19th century from Wescott and Hort, it has many errors, one of them is leaving out Acts 8:37, as a result most.. if not all English Bibles leave that out...WHY?? simply put after believing Jesus to be Lord who died for the sins of the world..those those wish to be baptized as such need only believe in the Lord Jesus with their WHOLE HEART, not believe in and be a part of a pagan christian cult like Catholicism, Jehovah Wit., Later Day Saints, ...ect, That small piece in this film carries means quite a bit when you look at the millions that have believed otherwise. Christian cult churches have no doubt made a small fortune with infant baptism(like a baby could hold such a belief in their heart..lol.) and conning others into thinking they must belong to some man made religion that uses only parts of the Bible when it suits their needs and when it does not, they craft a corrupt text for English Bibles to be printed with words taken away and added to.(Deuteronomy 4:2, Revelation 22:18-19) I write this because it says based on a true store, thus I think it needs clarification. Based on a true story's from a catholic couple..lol, one of which is a spiritual medium that relates with the demonic spirits..lol, yeah, that sounds like a Christian..lol, more like Christian Cult. Anyone who stills thinks Catholicism is Christian, let me make this simple, the word Christian has in it the word Christ, as in Christ is the only way to God, a very narrow gate, their is not other thus the world CHRISTian, Rome on the other hand makes many compromises, because it is a political system mixed with many pagan beliefs, you only need to google..Vatican Catechism 841, follow the link that says Vatican, so you know you are on the harlot churches website, scroll down to paragraph and you will see what they say about those who worship moon god alah  {841 The Church's relationship with the Muslims. ""The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day.""} what a bunch of BS that is. Now they have a new show out called ""Annabelle"" no doubt a story from this same couple from the church of rome, so cannot wait to see if the catholic cult church plays a roll in it as well..lol, a horror show with an evil church mascaraing as a Christian church, I so cannot wait to see it, I love horror shows, I just need to get past the revulsion of the old harlot scarlet church being mentioned.",1412985600,,3119,4.539964476021314

The acting, production values and quality of the script are so far superior to most horror films that are produced these days. There is an overriding creepiness to the film that provides a wonderful atmosphere of dread. I was astonished to see the R rating, because there is very little cussing and nothing in the language that would justify an R rating. There is also no sex or sensuality in the movie. The most violent part of the movie is the climax towards the end, and it is very scary, but I am not so sure that it warrents an R rating.  Obviously, this is not a family film.

Most are not scary, lack an atmosphere of dread and spookiness, and have terrible stories accompanied by terrible acting. Having someone pop around a corner while you are hit with a sudden blast of music or noise is not scary...it is annoying and cheap. ""The Conjuring"" however manages to create a good atmosphere of spookiness. I was not scared (it takes a lot to truly scare me after all I have been through), but it did manage to make the hair on my arms stand up. The acting was very good, the plot is good and has a somewhat true story behind it, and the subject matter is one that can spook most people if done right. The filming and camera views along with special effects are well done and not overly reliant on CGI. The music was good too. This may not scare the pants off you, depending on what you tend to watch, but it will spook you some and make you think about it afterwards.",1411862400,,1023,4.278350515463917

Patric Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor all did a great job in this, especially Vera. There were a few parts where I felt it was a bit contrived, however overall I really enjoyed this. Especially in a time where horror is severely lacking original ideas and is filled with overdone franchises milking their ideas for one more cash cow, this was a nice introduction of a possible anthology series.",1411862400,,513,4.648351648351649
5404630,5,B00AAA62TI,"Well, here we are, digging into a haunted house story with roots tied to Amittyville.  Those roots are Ed and Lorraine Warren.  Parapsychologists? Ghost hunters?  Demonoligists? Kooks?  Pick your label. I'm going to stay away from doing so because I think they're all of those and more.  Leading lives as people who seek out strange phenomena and try to deal with the darker sides of reality, you might think that they are insane, and you would probably be right.  Some of the cases that they have reported on and been involved with would make even the heartiest of skeptics think twice.  So here we have The Conjuring.  Before Amittyville, which is probably the Warrens' most famous case, we had a big, scary farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island.  The year is 1971.  And the Perron family has just moved in.

The film actually starts with the story of Anabelle, a hugely scary-looking possessed doll (movie coming soon) that runs amok on a couple of college girls, ransacking their apartment and writing notes and being super-creepy.  In steps the Warrens and they put an end to Anabelle's reign of terror, taking the doll with them and stashing it in their personal depository of cursed things in a locked room in their own home.  Here is where you need to drop the whole ""Based On A True Story"" nonsense right off the bat.  If Hollywood has gotten its hooks in it, it's not very TRUE at all.  Sure, there are certain aspects of the film that are based on actual accounts, but in this case, take for instance Anabelle.  In the movie the doll is three feet tall and literally scary as f*ck.  I mean, when you see it, your first reaction is ""Who in the hell would own that doll, let alone sleep with it in their room?"" It is one step away from the creepy clown doll in Poltergeist. Same deal.  Anabelle (the real Anabelle, and yes, she's real) is actually a Raggedy Ann doll.  And she has done some seriously creepy things (if you care to research).  She is locked up in a cabinet at the New England Society For Psychic Research. But she bears no resemblance to the doll in the movie nor do they tell you what she did after leaving the college girls' home.  So, like I said, keep that ""Based On A True Story"" stuff out of the equation and realize that this is just a really scary movie.  Enter the Perron family.  Mom (Lili Taylor).  Dad (Ron Livingston). Five daughters.  The move into the dilapidated farmhouse and everything is going great except the family dog absolutely refuses to enter the house and one of their daughters finds a boarded up entrance to a cellar filled with all kinds of stuff from a rotting piano to various other furnishings.  The next day they their dog, Sadie, is discovered dead in the yard by their youngest daughter April, who also finds a mysterious and creepy antique music box.  Let the serious haunting begin.  At first its subtle.  A slammed door.  Weird sensations. Two of their daughters are accosted by some dark figure in the bedroom.  The ghosties go full out when husband Roger is away in Florida.  Enter Ed and Lorraine Warren.  Their house isn't haunted.  It's infested with a demonic force that is surrounding the family.  Leaving is not an option.  The force will just follow them.  Researching the property, Ed and Lorraine discover that it has a case of the nasties spanning all the way back to the spooky days when the original 200 acre property was owned by an accused witch, Bathsheba, who tried to sacrifice her week-old child to the devil and killed herself in 1863, cursing anyone who would try and take possession of her land.  Since that time the land had been parceled and split and the Warrens discover a plethora of bad things, murders and suicides, have take place in the surrounding properties over the years.  Uh. Oh.

The Conjuring is scary.  Super scary.  From the director of Saw and Insidious, James Wan.  Not the pedigree I would have preferred.  I can't stand ultra-gore tripe like Saw and Insidious was just decent.  Wan outdoes himself here.  Forget both of those aforementioned franchises.  The Conjuring just might be his masterpiece.  There is no real gore here.  There is no nudity or sex of any kind.  No curse words (of the vulgar variety, to be sure).  No ultra-violence. None of the above.  This movie is rated R because it is absolutely terrifying.  The true story aspect tends to lend to that credibility (but like I said, how much? how far?).  The Warrens are real people.  The Perrons are real people.  Anabelle is a real doll.  Whatever else is purely speculative.  All I can say is, if even 20 minutes of this movie is true, those people should have gotten a medal. Seriously.  With the hooflaw that surrounded The Amittyville Horror after Hollywood got a hold of it, The Conjuring should just remain a scary movie.  End of story.  The acting is good.  The characters are real.  You don't find yourself hating them like you do in most scary movies, for making stupid decisions.  The Perrons don't play with Ouija boards or mediums or tarot cards.  They don't invite this entity into their house.  It's already there.  And it's been waiting for anyone to come along and play.

5404633,2,B00AAA62TI,"My biggest complaint about this frivolous Amityville knockoff is that the ""actors"" are just plain unconvincing.

No matter how prominent their sideburns or horrible their clothes, none of them could convince me it was the 70s, or that they were a real family (rather than a group of B-lists collaborating on a project). They couldn't convince me the house was freezing cold, or that there was really a foul stench in the air, or that the ghosts were really terrifying... In fact, not even the ghosts themselves could convince me to take them (or their psychiatric problems) seriously. Don't know why this movie got so many high ratings.

To be fair, I missed the end because I fell asleep. So I have no clue why the ghosts were haunting the joint. And I don't know if the movie redeemed itself in the last 20 minutes. I don't care enough to find out, either.

I don't think people should waste their money on this one. It was a tedious bore. Get The Amityville Horror (1979) instead.",1411603200,,983,4.605714285714286

5404661,3,B00AAA62TI,"This is another film inspired by true eventsor at least events that the people reporting them seem to believe are true.

There was a pair of ghost-hunter/exorcists named Lorraine and Ed Warren, who are played in this movie by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson.  What they claim was their hardest case was the Perron family, who bought a large farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971 and very quickly became terrorized by what they felt was a ghost, or something supernatural.  Eventually they turn to the Warrens who conclude the mom in the family has actually been possessed, and perform an exorcism ritual.

Whats interesting about this as opposed to some other ghost-story?  One: at the time of filming Lorraine Warren was still alive; one of the special features interviews her about her work.  Two: another special feature interviews the Perron family, who bought the house in question.  Three: apparently there really IS a special prayer, orIm not sure what to call it, but a liturgy in Latin that the Roman Catholic church has used in exorcisms.  I think this movie presented a longer portion of it than I have seen elsewhere.  Four: best line, perhapsnot even taken from the movie, but from one of the special features: You people who want to dabble in Oija boards, tarot cards and sances---maybe you WILL contact a spirit [of the departed]or maybe youll contact something ELSEsomething you aren't prepared for.  I give the movie a C+.  I didn't think there was anything really spectacular about the acting, or the cinematography, or the script, or special effects.  Mainly it is of some historical interest for those interested in the history of supernatural phenomena and those who believe in them.  The special features were, I think, more interesting than the film itselfwhich is why I always enjoy seeing films on disc.",1409529600,,1824,4.921568627450981

5404698,4,B00AAA62TI,"Fancy a scare? Want your blood curdled? THE CONJURING has got somethin' for you. It's a terrifying return to classic haunted house horror, ironically brought to you by James Wan, him what directed the original SAW and so ushered in the torture p0rn sub-genre. THE CONJURING is based on the harrowing true-life case files of professional ghost hunters/occasionally debunkers Ed and Lorraine Warren. Thanks to my good pal, the Wiki, I learned that the Warrens were called in to investigate the Amityville Horror case and The Haunting in Connecticut, two celebrated cases that were made into motion pictures. Hoax or genuine, the Warrens and their forays into the occult have been impacting horror cinema for decades.

THE CONJURING chronicles the Warrens' most disturbing case. In 1971, in Harrisville, Rhode Island, no sooner do Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) and their five little daughters move into their new home than they're terrorized by a series of paranormal occurrences seemingly set of when the clock strikes 3:07am. At her wits' end, a distressed Carolyn approaches the Warrens after one of their speaking engagements and implores them to sort out their malignant home.

Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) is the one credible demonologist invested with authority outside the Catholic Church. His wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) is a psychic of surpassing sensitivity who can perceive and communicate with restless spirits. They had braved malevolent haunts in the past, but when they cross the threshold into the Perrons' isolated farm house, they come face to face with their most terrifying, most vindictive apparition yet.

So I don't know about the Warrens' bona fides. But so what? What matters is that this ""biopic"" also happens to be a tremendous horror film. James Wan, who had doled out ghoulish gore by the bucket in past films, pulls off the scares brilliantly, and without relying on lazy techniques and on clich. For one thing, Wan doesn't use loud, jaggedy jump music to stress the scares. Instead he rolls with the subtle, slow burn approach, allows the storytelling to inform the characters and plot, and makes us invest in the imperiled family of seven and on the husband & wife ghosthunting team. Since this is supposed to be a biopic, Wan takes great pains to get things right with regards to historical detail and period authenticity. He injects a realistic feel to this horror show.

It's an exemplary cast, really. Lili taylor and Vera Farmiga may be the two standouts of the bunch as, respectively, the targeted, slowly deteriorating mother and the fragile clairvoyant whose cracks have begun to show. Ron Livingston, by virtue of having not much to do, is the least effective. It's worth mentioning that the child actors handle their business well, with Joey King deserving of serious plaudits. She showed up on everyone's radar earlier that year as Channing Tatum's honorable daughter in WHITE HOUSE DOWN. Joey King is key in one of the film's most shivery sequences as her ""Christine"" lies quaking in bed as a disembodied presence repeatedly tugs at her limbs. That scene works beautifully because King convincingly projects primal, pee-in-her-pants dread. she's awesome.

The frights are these nerve-jangling moments, partly because you genuinely care for the people being victimized. Wan keeps the CGI at a minimum. He fashions a creepy atmosphere and an escalating sense of doom. He throws in startling imagery and the occasional odd noise. But he doesn't fake the scares, the film earns all of them. The third act is a ridiculously intense, supremely scary-ass rollercoaster. It's still not as scary as that drawn-out children's game of ""Hide and Clap."" Evil spirits just don't play fair.

It's an indication of how well thought of THE CONJURING was that the studio's already announced a sequel, ANNABELLE. That one focuses on the creepy, creepy doll featured in THE CONJURING's opening minutes.",1407283200,,3949,5.133748055987558
5404699,3,B00AAA62TI,"This movie was a jump a minute once it got going, and I enjoyed it. But, I must say here after reading so many reviews, this story is NOT true. Ed and Lorraine Warren are not real paranormal as they claim, and the whole paranormal community has let their distain for these two people know. Ed I believe is now dead, not sure about L. Their lies made them and continues to make their estates very rich. These are the two that said the AMITYVILLE HORROR HOUSE was haunted  and still remains so. NO says the current owner and the one before him, and the one before him and so forth since the Lutz left. We know that whole story was false, even the kids later said their mother and step father lied to make money from the story. The Lutz's too are now dead.  So watch this for fun but everything you see here is a little folly written by the Warrens and sold to make money from people who so want a haunted house story. Who wants to see a movie about a ""nice"" house? Not me. So enjoy it, One of the people involved says it did not happen the way the Warrens told it.

5404705,3,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is not a another terrible teen, young adult, slasher horror movie with cheap scares and that is why I give it three and a half stars. It is so hard find any good horror movies with adults and an honest to goodness mature theme and this movie has it. It has a good (not great) story, and the movie is entertaining. They even turn the lights on in a room first, before they go in and they do not walk into that vary dark room that the very strange haunting noise is coming from. Lets face it, logic dictates a normal person would not walk into a dark and scary room unless you are a complete idiot. Those stupid teen, young adult scare flicks love to do that and it is so boring.

Let me make clear that I do not scare easy nor do I believe in ghost or the paranormal and most movies that do come even close to scaring me are based on true to life stories about bent and or sick humans that can really hurt and yes scare others. Movies like, Misery, Silence of the Lambs, Shutter Island and the original Exorcise have scared me and can be disturbing. Isn't it interesting that these four classics are also academy award winners. As entertaining The Conjuring is, it is not academy award material and it did not really scare me. But I did enjoy the acting and I was entertained.

I also do not understand why the movie is rated R as there is hardly any blood, except for some the more in your face scary parts, might be intense. I question if that was what the director wanted an R rating to make the movie seem darker and edgier. Anyway good flick and fun to watch.",1406937600,,1577,4.201320132013201

After viewing the whole spectacle, I'm left with the usual internal gnawing of how much is true and how much is completely made up. There seems to be a huge difference in Hollywood if it's based on a true story or inspired by true events. The latter can deviate so much from the real events that the movie could be unrecognizable to the real participants. It would seem if the real participants refuse to comment on the actual events, the movie gains even more cult status/mystery. And then in contrast, when the real participants do talk, you often think scam.  The 'truth' in these movies only works for me if I know the original participants were on the set everyday, making sure their stories were told accurately....something that is a rarity indeed.",1406160000,2,842,4.6891891891891895

Most of the horror films that are made today focus too much on blood and nastiness to shock the audience. Relentless noises and blood only scare you for a while but after that the movie goes in to  boredom mode. The Conjuring is different as  the accounts are based on real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren ( the  same people who investigated the happenings at Amityville Horror) played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. They investigate strange happenings at a house in Harrisville, Rhode Island.  Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) and their five daughters start to experience strange sounds, birds crashing in to the side of the house, unexplained bruises on the mom's body etc. All the five girls do a remarkable job in their acting because their role was tough. Lili Taylor is amazing as the mother and so is the remarkable chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. They look like a couple in love. The acting and the direction  is the reason to watch Conjuring.
James Wan has done a great job in building the tension and suspense slowly and scaring the daylights out of us. And yes, the end hints of a sequel.",1406073600,,1260,4.657657657657658

5404768,2,B00AAA62TI,"FYI- I don't go into watching a contemporary horror film wanting to criticize it to pieces. BUT; How I long for a return to horror films which at least took the time to TRY to give the viewer some idea of what motivates the characters to put themselves into scary, dangerous situations. Here, it's ""explained"" with a single line about it being what they were meant to do. A LITTLE real ambivalence and feeling torn would've been welcome here. Especially when they have a YOUNG DAUGHTER who could be in SERIOUS DANGER.
Three vintage automobiles does not an early 1970's setting make. Why bother setting it then (despite the true story having occurred at that time) if hairstyles, clothing, general attitudes and slang (""Dude""? Guys said ""Man"" back then, unless they were, like, actual surfers) are going to be so generic? I guess the studio can't risk scaring away its shallow conception of contemporary audiences. And, once again, I found myself shouting at the characters- ""JUST TURN ON THE LIGHTS, for crying out loud!""
I will say this in the film's favor; the score was superb. The scene with the clapping game in the cellar is CLASSIC. Even though I knew what was coming. Thinking of it STILL gives me the creeps. There was a good sense of place inside the house. And I admire the director/producers allowing the ending to just BE instead of adding a typical it's-not-over scary-face jump-scare (sorry if you consider that a spoiler). I sort of recommend it with reservations. There were many sleazy directions it could've gone into but didn't.",1403481600,3,1548,4.823308270676692

I  had to hide my eyes a couple of times.  Prayers before bed time for sure after watching this.  I loved the special features on the blue ray too... they don't make it any less chilling.  If you want to be terrified, this movie will do it for you.  It's scarier than any movie I have ever seen involving Hauntings/ demonic possession.

I could not sleep because of the storm and needed something to watch. So - it was a ""perfect"" setting for a scary movie. The acting is pretty good, not great but what can you expect from a horror flick? The whole side-story about the doll was odd and out of place and did not add anything to the main story. As another reviewer noted the scene with the Perron's daughter in their home also seemed out of place to the movie. My complaint is that I never quite got the full story of WHY the house was haunted and why/how the witch  possessed the mother. I did not even really understand the story of the witch who cursed her land because it was just so much of an off-hand commentary about it. It all flashed by so quickly as if it was not really important.  While Lorraine Warren says there are MANY entities in the house and we know there is a boy named Rory, the story never fills us in on them, it only focuses on the demonic posession.  We find out in passing who Rory is, but only in a ""he used to live there and was killed by his mother"" comment. Either I missed it or it was not explained why the cellar was borded up.  We never know why there was a secret door in the wardrobe or why there seem to be secret passageways between the walls.  The sotry builds and builds on the posession and then at the ""great showdown"" it all falls flat.  It's like Julie Andrews came in and sang ""My Favorite things"" and everything just poof was all better!!! Just think happy thoughts and demonic posession ends! It was such a let down.  It kept my mind off the storm for 2 hours. It did not creep me out, make me jump or scream or flinch or have bad dreams. If anyone had been watchign it with me, I would not have grabbed onto them. You see very little at all of the entities haunting the house or the witch posessing her. It was entertaining and one of the better supernatural flicks I have seen in some time. In the end I was glad I had not spent the $s to see it at a movie theater, except it might have been nice to see it on a huge screen.",1403136000,,2153,4.028103044496487

5404775,3,B00AAA62TI,"Supposedly based on a true story, director James Wan's THE CONJURING is about an unsuspecting family of seven moving into a secluded farmhouse (Why is it always a secluded farmhouse?) that's full of dark, demonic forces.  As the hauntings and disturbings ratchet up in intensity, the Perron family enlists the aid of Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), paranormal ""investigators"" who thoroughly inspect and examine the house--and conclude the structure is in dire need of an exorcism.  Yet there is no time to obtain the Catholic Church's blessing, as the main spirit has possessed matriarch Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor); accordingly Ed Warren must attempt the exorcism himself.  This sequence produces some of the film's scariest--and unfortunately, most laughable--moments, culminating in the predictable fuzzy ending.

Yes, THE CONJURING has its scary moments, but it also has its over-the-top moments, and throughout this extraordinarily uneven film it almost telegraphs its predictability.  The chemistry between Farmiga and Wilson is passing, yet the characters keep getting bogged down when Ed continues to object to Lorraine going with him to investigate, with Lorraine in kind overruling the objection.  It was a convincing device the first time--not the fifth.  The effects are good, the demonic apparitions a tad overdone, and the blood and gore held down to a dull roar.  No THE CONJURING hasn't re-invented the haunt wheel, but for horror fans fond of occasionally jumping out of their seat, this tale should scratch that itch.

5404778,3,B00AAA62TI,"I agree with other reviewers here that 2013's 'The Conjuring' succeeds where most recent haunting/possession/exorcism films fail:  it's actually scary.  Yes, the characters are thinly drawn; the plot is nothing you haven't seen dozens of times before (borrowing obvious elements from 'The Exorcist,' 'Poltergeist,' 'The Amityville Horror,' etc., to tell its 'true' story, and similar visually to the scores of atmosphere-driven supernatural thrillers released in the past decade); the script periodically gets bogged down in inconsequential exposition; and the ending is soft and pat.  But the product as a whole is more than the sum of its parts as it does two fundamental things well-- it pulls you in and, without giving you much of a chance to catch a skeptic's breath, keeps creeping you out-- both of which I suppose must be credited to the skills of director James Wan and editor Kirk Morri.

house are haunted by some sort of evil spirit, and most of them fall flat at scaring their viewers. The Conjuring (2013) which supposedly is based on real life events experienced by a couple studying paranormal activities, is quite the opposite from the rest of them.  This film combines haunted house story with exorcist type of fright. I don't remember last time a horror movie scared me this much as Conjuring did.  The only other movie I can think of would be Sinister (2012).  There are some scenes in the Conjuring comparable only to the great scenes from movies like The Omen (1976) and The Exorcist (1973).

5404784,5,B00AAA62TI,Not too fan of these genre but movie was scary and realistic. Unlike other cheap movies. Great actors and effects,1402531200,,113,4.7
5404785,4,B00AAA62TI,"The plot to this new chiller is hardly original, and the characters are predictable.

However, there are some genuinely good scares, and the set pieces are nice.

The downsides are the ""all witches are evil"" and ""the witches at the Salem trials were really witches""... it was unforgivable hokiness.

The music is good and the creepy doll and music box are a nice touch.

Good to see once, but no replay value.",1402444800,2,409,4.638888888888889
5404786,5,B00AAA62TI,"I loved the movie and the bluray is perfect. Clear and thrilling to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was a newer horror movie, which usually makes me skeptical but this is one that horror fans out there have to check out! Well done.",1402358400,,242,4.4
5404787,5,B00AAA62TI,Not what I was expecting especially since it was supposed to be based on a real story but they never really stay true to real stories I wish they did though. I think it would have been better if they would have done a REAL STORY VERSION (not documentary but story & same with Possession/dybbuk box).,1402358400,,299,4.357142857142857
5404788,5,B00AAA62TI,"Horror movies almost always are disappointing, maybe because what's scary is so subjective and or personal. The Exorcist was SCARY by pretty much anyone's standards and scares like that are few and far between. The kind that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.  Jaws is scary in its own right but a totally different type, the fear of what we know is really out there regardless of how they manipulate the facts.

The Conjuring is creepy and quite possibly the best film about Exorcism since The Exorcist. That's a bold statement because I think the 1973 classic may be the scariest film of all time. The Conjuring has some really good scares and doesn't use tricks to get cheap ones either...or at least they seem warranted and used wisely.

The acting is realistic with the characters reacting normally to these things going on. The demon ghosts are spooky and there is a sense of fear running through you while you watch this film. Scary? At my age it's hard to watch a movie and say it's scary, but this is a great film and it is creepy as hell!",1402272000,,1067,4.461538461538462

5404798,5,B00AAA62TI,"Overall this is a solid scary movie that can be a bit predictable in parts. The story line is solid and a bit different than most ghost stories which is a nice departure from the typical ones coming out these days. There are some suspenseful parts which make it a fast watch. The story line  also provides some nice surprises as the story progresses. The acting, directing and script are well done and I would definitely watch this movie again. I will say that this is definitely not for younger children as some of the scenes are a bit graphic in nature.",1401408000,,555,4.4411764705882355
5404799,5,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is a fantastic film with a solid story and a great cast that any movie lover should watch.  Unlike so many films that fall into the horror/scary film genre, the conjuring does not rely on cheap scares, gore, or a shaky camera to try and frighten the audience.  Instead, the Conjuring more closely resembles the original Exorcist, and has rightfully earned a place next to it on any movie lover's shelf.",1401321600,,416,4.684931506849315

I've watched this movie multiple times with many different people and it is scary every time. I wish there were more movies out there like this one to scare me!!

The only negative I would say was that the end was a little over the top for me. But this didn't stop my enjoyment of this great film.
I hope Hollywood makes more of these. Maybe a Conjuring 2??  (Hint Hint)

5404818,5,B00AAA62TI,"I do agree with some reviewers who said that towards the end it started to go off the wheels a bit, but overall I felt it was a very effective movie. As with all adaptations based on true stories, of course some artistic license is going to be taken, but in this case it doesn't take away from the horrors this family went through. There were some fantastic ""jump"" scenes, especially when Lili Taylor is alone in the dark in the cellar, and is asked if she wants to play ""hide-and-clap"". I DID jump. And here I was watching the film alone in the house at night, all lights off, volume on the TV up pretty high. The Annabelle story at the beginning was also quite freaky. As far as the casting goes, Vera Farmiga deserves top honors for her portrayal of Lorraine Warren, her fears not only for the Perrons but for her own family, her unwavering faith, her belief in everything she and her husband were doing, she was great, I think she really did the real Lorraine Warren a good deal of justice in her portrayal of her. The young actresses who play the terrified children were also great...they were believable, they were so naturalistic it was almost as if no acting was actually required. And Lili Taylor was fantastic as the brutalized, terrified family matriarch. Things did go over the top towards the end, but overall I would say this is one of the best horror films to come out in recent years.",1400371200,,1400,4.45136186770428

From the trailer, I had expected an all-out fright-fest, but was pleasantly surprised to find it a true family movie (there are 2 families - the Perrons & the Warrens) about bad things happening to good people.  When the Perron family ends up in a quagmire of evil they don't deserve and can't even begin to understand, the Warrens try to help them come to terms with it & defeat it.  So, basically, a good vs. evil story, but the actors do such a fantastic job of being ""ordinary people"" - like people you know, your neighbors, etc. - that it's easy to sympathize & cry or cheer when appropriate in the film.  Yes, it has a lot of scary moments, but there is also a lot of affection and kindness, and I never felt the scary moments were overdone.  It isn't the sort of movie that inspires nightmares, but rather it seems to be THE story that inspired all those other films that cause nightmares.  It was not too heavy on special effects, but those that were used added to the story rather than overwhelming it.  BTW - my mom saw it with me and she loved it, too!!",1397433600,,1122,4.289099526066351

5404864,4,B00AAA62TI,"First and foremost this movie is about Ed and Lorraine Warren. As a horror movie fan, the Warrens have always been a source of contention for me. The way I've always seen it, the best case scenario says that the Warrens truly believe in what they do and they offer a sense of closure to those who employ them. The worst case scenario says that they are shameless con artists manipulating the fears of those who employ them. The Conjuring didn't make me believe that they were the real deal - but it made me want to. Much of the credit goes to the talented and eclectic cast, something horror films rarely use any sort of budget on. The Conjuring works with a less is more approach, that what they don't show you can often be much scarier than what they do. It's effectively creepy with minimal gore. The story is a simple haunted house tale but it moves at a good pace and the end result left me satisfied.

I miss quality paranormal movies and this was a welcome change from all the Blood splattering, teenage screaming that are shown in the cinemas so frequently.
The two main characters are very well acted and it's based on two real people - Ed & Lorraine Warren, the whole thing has been filmed and treated with professionalism and respect.
The makers of this film treat the subject with respect and I think that is what made it such a satisfying experience.

5404878,2,B00AAA62TI,"ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a witchy woman that was a Satanist that sacrificed her baby. Then she hung herself. Then she comes back and possesses some other mommies that move into the house. Then she makes those mommies kill their kids. The house is like a big hotel for killer mommy spirits. WOW. True story, bro. But, needs more dragons.

A new mommy moves into the suicidal Satanist's house and creaky doors start opening and all the clocks stop at 3:07 AM. That's eerie as hell... Not really, but it must have sounded good on paper. The new mommy gets crazy Ed and Lorraine Warren to save her family because the Warrens believe in God. The new mommy is not religious but she still gets possessed by the witchy woman. And, she wants to kill her kids really bad. And that's just wrong. If you were a Satanic spirit, why would you want to possess someone that wasn't a threat to your religion? I would only possess believers. But, that's just me. And why doesn't anyone ever get possessed by Jesus and start working miracles? Why is it always the Devil? And why doesn't Jesus ever actually show up at an exorcism? I think he should at least make an appearance once in a while.

SPOILER ALERT: In an amazing plot twist at the end, the Warrens DO save the family because Eddy Warren has a Bible and he reads it out loud. (Although, not very well.) But, for some reason the Warrens can't stop the birds from killing themselves. Why couldn't the Warrens save the birds? What kind of Christians are these people? Is there a special exorcism bird Bible for suicidal pigeons? If not, there should be.

After watching this, I'm absolutely convinced that Andrea Yates didn't drown her children. She was possessed by a demon. Andrea Yates should have hired the Warrens to testify at her trial that the devil made her do it. She could be out of jail right now and baking apple pies for a brand new set of kids. But apparently, God works in mysterious ways. And, the Warrens are hucksters. This is just another one of their hoaxes.

SPOILER ALERT: At first I was frightened because they said that this was a TRUE STORY. But at the end, Ed Warren says that God and the Devil are REAL. So... I know that they just made it all up. Phew. That was close.

Is this scary? YEAH. People actually gave money to James Wan to make this movie and it did make money. And that's really really scary.

2 Stars for making me laugh out loud.",1395187200,4,2413,4.4112359550561795
5404879,3,B00AAA62TI,"The movie I would rate as a ""C"" and that is because this is shortly after my birthday and I am still happy over that. In reality this was a fairly entertaining movie that is unbelivably forgettable. It hasn't been that long since I saw it and I would have a great deal of difficulty in telling you what ""happened"", or more importantly what didn't happen. I did not get scared. There were no real surprises, the acting was mediocre at best but again, it was worth a cheap rental.
DO NOT PURCHASE EVEN A USED COPY as you will not want to waste the space to store the thing. It might make for a good regift if you haven't rented it and seen it already. My suggestion is to find a highly rated 3rd party seller, buy a used copy, be careful taking it out of its hopefully shrink wrapping and when done watching it, regift it to someone you feel deserves a gift of this quality.
I would recommend otherwise to rent this movie or wait a while until Amazon Prime provides it for free for Prime Members. Or look for it on Netflix or elsewhere. Again, I cannot stress enough, you won't want to watch this thing more than once.",1395014400,,1116,4.244131455399061

Perhaps because the film is ""based on a true story,"" the screenwriters were limited in the boundaries they could push, and so the film plays out like a better-than-average haunted house flick, using the same old tactics but better this time. My ideal horror movie is one that isn't afraid to push buttons or defy artistic norms.

Sadly, many offered to tell their story but none ever did so in the wonderful way as they did in ""The Conjuring.""  It is about time that a director and crew took the time to get to know Lorraine Warren and hear the story of the Perrons' first hand.  Sadly Ed Warren has passed away, but he took scrupulous notes and used cutting edge technology (for the time) to document the hauntings.  Ed Warren was the only Church sanctioned Demonologists in the US, that was not a member of the clergy.  He and Lorraine had the power to fast-track an exorcism not because of any office he held, but by the fact that he and Lorraine were held in high esteem by the Catholic Church.  The movie is scary, both with loud sounds and frightening entities, lots of poltergeist activities and extreme tests of faith, but as the Lorraine character said in the movie, ""I think God brought us together for a purpose, Ed.""  Clearly he did.  This is a must see movie and there is another one scheduled to come out at the end of the year.  Different director than in ""The Conjuring,"" so I am scared, no! terrified of changing what worked so very well in this movie.

There are lots of hokey effects derivative of The Exorcist and The Haunting, nothing remotely scary, and as the story lurches toward a climax, actors banging from room to room, in such darkness that it is impossible to know who is doing what to whom.

5404908,3,B00AAA62TI,"I should preface this little review by stating that I have seen a great many movies which use the same setup and scare tactics that The Conjuring did. Therefore it wasn't very scary to me at all. However, if you do not watch this sort of thing very often then it may be quite effective and you should enjoy it more than I did. I did like the opening of the movie which tells a little story of a haunted doll. I won't spoil what becomes of that but I did wind up thinking that that would have made for a more interesting feature movie.

The acting was fine but the story and scares were predictable. If you are looking for this sort of thing then rather watch the superior (in my opinion) The Orphanage, The Devils Backbone, Paranormal Activity (first one only),The Woman in Black, or the first half of Insidius. Those movies, I feel, are scarier and better put together.

  For a modern day almost ""Amityvile"" (they actually went there to investigate), it is really good.  The cast who did the family, I almost actually believed they were one.  The scares, were actually scary.  The gore was minimal (not that I mind gore, but it gets so tiresome when it's overused).  And I was sad that I had not seen this on the silver screen.

But this movie is great because it's one of those that doesn't add too much in special effects but rather leaves more to your imagination and scares the witts out of you.  It scared me so much that after it ended (family was in bed I watched alone), I was too afraid to go shower before I went to bed!!!  That has never happened!!",1393027200,2,440,4.011494252873563

5404950,2,B00AAA62TI,"This movie serves as a big wet sloppy kiss to Ed and Lorraine Warren, from the moment it opens and we see them saving folks from a demon haunted Raggedy Anne doll (Google it) to the final scenes where the two hold each other and look on as the family they've saved tussles in the yard before them like a litter of likable but ultimately helpless puppies.

Now as it happens, the Warren's don't just take on cases. When they get involved, they are likely to help you with your laundry, or fix up that dilapidated clunker you're never going to get to. They're just Good Folk. You might get some snark from Ed if you ask why he puts a thermostat on a camera, but seriously, these are world renowned paranormalists and who are you to question their strange ways?

Ed believes wholeheartedly in exorcisms, but says these are best left for Vatican pros. In a pinch though, Ed can be persuaded to just 'wing it' and get rid of the demon that has made you its 'vessel'.

I have to give the movie a couple of stars because it did manage to make me jump exactly twice. Before watching it, you should know the following additional things:
- Lack of originality. There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen done to death before. We all know that basements are big no nos in a horror movie, that rooms become colder when paranormal activities are going on, that your pets are going to freak out in such situations, that the 'little girl' is going to have an uncanny connection with the spirit realm.
- Too much in common with other Warren cases. You know, like the Amityville horror which they only had a marginal association with. Guess what, same cold factor, dog factor, spooky time of day (3:15 vs 3:07) factor, family circumstance, etc.
- No conjuring. I mean really, if you aren't going to call the movie Poltergeist Redux or  An Exorcism in Schmamityville, at least work the title of your movie into the content somehow. Sheesh.",1392595200,6,1931,4.492877492877493

The sound effects make you jump even if you've already seen it, plus is combinds two true horror stories. One focuses on AnnaBelle the haunted doll. The other, which it mostly focuses on is a very extreme case that the real paranormal detectives investigated.

As a horror fan in movies (especially zombie movies) what I look for is a movie with a well put together story and actors that fit the role good whether they be famous or new at their work it does not matter as long as they draw me in to make the story and the part they are playing feel real. Director James Wan was the first hit for me. James directed the 'saw' franchise, 'dead silence (another great movie), 'insidious' and 'insidious: chapter 2' (both also great) as well as other films. The whole story and the make-up and effects were brilliant I was (as well as the rest of the audience at the movie thearet) were screaming and hanging on the edge of the chair for more.

I know this movie is based on a true story but I don't believe in that or ghost. It has all the elements of the Polyergus movie but they don't use them. The creepy tree, creepy doll and the creepy closet. But nothing happens. The tree has someone being hanged but all you see is the feet. the doll is scary but all IT DOUSE is turn its head around and you assume it colored walls and ceiling and got out of its cage. And the closet or ""wardrobe"" scenes are just funny, the girl keeps walking in to it and you can't help it but laugh. Nothing happens and when you think something scary is going to happen...it doesn't. In my opinion this movie should be rated PG because this is perfect horror movie that has been dumb downto be a PG movie Its just a bad horror movie. Is it afule compared to really bad horror movies?

5404997,5,B00AAA62TI,"This is a genuinely scary movie, due in large part to the amazing performances of Lili Taylor, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga.  In some ways a film within a film, I was initially skeptical of the movie because droves of people told me how bad it sucked.  We must have seen a different movie.  James Wan *never* fails to deliver these days, it would seem.

The story begins in 1971, as Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) move their family into a dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around it with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Perron family wherever they go. To stop this evil, the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this spectral menace at its source that threatens to destroy everyone involved.

It sounds like a redux of the Amityville Horror, and in some ways is, with lots of digital sheen and an increased amount of interpersonal tension: Ed and Lorraine, unbeknownst to the Perron family until later, are struggling with their paranormal abilities due to a failed exorcism they helped conduct in which a man died and Lorraine saw something that scared her nearly to death.  They have a collection of ""artifacts"" which come from each of their expeditions, and which a handyman wisely suggests they burn.  They will find another one from this one expedition as well, a sort of strange music box...

I have to say that Lili Taylor shines as the Jersey housewife who ends up being the victim of possession.  The way her face contorts, the bravery of her performance, just everything, is perfect.  She scared the hell out of me.  Yes, some of the scenes are obviously inspired by ""The Exorcist"", but as with everything else, James Wan makes it his own.

The others were the 1991 made-for-TV movie The Haunting, 2009s The Haunting in Connecticut, and of course, 1979s and 2005s The Amityville Horror.  Controversy has long surrounded the Warrens with many people firmly believing that these events were hoaxes.  The Conjuring is based on the 1971 case of the Perron family in Rhode Island. The film stars Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as Carolyn and Roger Perron who, along with their five daughters, move into an old farmhouse.

Within days of moving in the entire family begins to experience various supernatural disturbances.  Carolyn wakes with mysterious bruises that she cannot explain, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07AM, picture frames fly off walls, and the oldest daughter Andrea is attacked by the gruesome spirit of an old woman.  The couple contacts the Warrens who arrive to investigate the house and determine that the home is haunted by a demonic spirit and will require an Exorcism.  They discover the house was once home to a witch who hung herself from a nearby tree and cursed anyone who came onto the land.

While the Warrens seek approval from the Catholic Church to have an exorcism done, they setup their equipment inside the house to record the ever-more terrifying events.  When the home becomes to dangerous, the Warrens try to evacuate the house but Carolyn becomes possessed by the demon forcing the Warrens to perform the exorcism on their own.  Before long the evil spirit begins to threaten the Warrens daughter as well.

The Conjuring earns points mainly due to its simplicity.  While so many modern supernatural horror films rely on abundant and increasingly distracting CGI for special effects, The Conjuring is more old school relying on suspense and things that go bump in the night.  Its actors behave the way a real person would behave.  Theres not a lot of histrionics such as the usual man of the family who is always too willing to come up with a rational explanation for the events.

But The Conjuring pays for its lack of originality by being far too similar to films like Poltergeist, The Exorcism, and The Amityville Horror.  While it does what it does well with a fair amount of shock moments, there is an undeniable been there-done that tone to the action.  Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are refreshing and likable as the Warrens although the film doesnt help their reputation among some as charlatans by showing them with a room in their house filled with dozens of cursed or formerly possessed items that they have confiscated from previous cases.  While the Conjuring doesnt re-invent the haunted house film it definitely is one of the better entries weve seen in recent years.

5404999,2,B00AAA62TI,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. A family with 5 daughters moves into a house.
2. It's immediately obvious that something is amiss (Ghost Like Happenings).
3. The family is in touch with a clairvoyant and local expert (who happen to be married to each other).
4. The mother is possessed by *something*
5. She is exorcised (in a dramatic way).

My problems with this film are: 1. The suspense is too drawn out (the film is over 2 hours long and 90 minutes would have done). 2. This plot has already been done 1,000 times before. 3. The plot was not very clear. What exactly happened to make the house this way?

5405003,3,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring was finely acted and was well done.
So why only 3 Stars ?

Well maybe it is hard to fairly review this movie if you are more than 20 years old, but it feels like a variation on the Amityville Horror/Exorcist story that has been told and remade at least 100 times over the past 35 years.

So technically you can compliment the fine acting -- but emotionally you can't get into the movie because 40 minutes of non-stop yelling and screaming gets annoying ............. also you have seen or can predict every upcoming scene perfectly.

So younger people -or those who have not seen tons of movies in their life may be far more impressed with this film.

But I wager most people in their 30s, 40s, 50s or older may feel like they have seen this same movie many times before.

Actually, I had the pleasure of talking to a Hollywood film executive at a trade show one time and he told me Hollywood basically operates on a a15-20 year ""churning cycle"".

By this he meant they will knowingly re-hash ideas or do remakes for the current generation of movie-goers because what may be old news to a 60 year old may be a fresh new experience for a 16 year old.",1391212800,3,1163,4.361111111111111

5405015,4,B00AAA62TI,"Before I saw The Conjuring I heard a lot negative complaints that it was merely ""cattle prod cinema"" which I inferred meant a lot of awful stingers were the only thing that would make the audience jump. This horrible clich has been overabundant in many so-called ""horror"" movies for a good while now and I my expectations were low.

Thankfully, there are no stingers. Yes, there are scares and jumps, but the score is completely unobtrusive and there are no cats jumping out of closets or phones suddenly ringing. James Wan knows that atmosphere, cinematography, suggestion, and the unknown can build suspense and horror, and the Conjuring has plenty.

Apparently based on a true story (which I am extremely doubtful of, but not completely disbelieving) a happy family of mom and dad and five young girls move into a large farmhouse bought at a low price from a bank auction. As soon as they cross the threshold things are not quite right and the property reeks of pure, menacing evil. Eventually they call in the help of a local ghost-hunting couple to document the case and research its history.

It was the early 70s, the real Ghostbusters (pun intended) were still in college.

About 80% of The Conjuring works. The dread, the suspense, and the inability to comprehend what is really lurking in the darkness of the house makes for great horror. The girls see...something, but we don't. It's a lot like Robert Wise's The Haunting, which is kind of ironic since Lily Taylor, who plays the mother, was in the 1999 remake of that movie, which was full of all the worst horror clichs and set-ups, as well as excessive CGI. It's like Taylor wanted to set the balance straight by doing a movie that took the opposite, and more intelligent, approach.

John R. Leonetti's photography is very slick, with lots of slow, creeping shots, but I couldn't help but think that a rawer edge, with exploitation lighting, would have helped it look a bit more authentic. There are a bit too many slamming doors scares too, and towards the end it goes off on a completely pointless tangent with the Annabelle doll and does absolutely nothing with it. For the bulk of the running time The Conjuring seems original and groundbreaking, though in the last act it's a jumble of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and What Lies Beneath.

The positives still far outweigh the negatives, and I still recommend the film to horror fans. If only we had a version of The Amityville Horror that was made this way instead of that horrendous 2005 movie. No doubt there will be numerous sequels.

The Blu-ray looks great in 2.40:1 1080p with brilliant DTS HD-MA sound. The extras could have been more satisfying.",1390953600,2,2670,4.75377969762419

5405031,4,B00AAA62TI,"I generally do not buy horror flicks, or anything demonic, vulger and profanity without ceasing. I bought this because it is true and I was aware of it for years, and it involved Ed and Lorraine Warren. Well known and respected demonologists and Christians. I was tempted to go with 5 stars, but feel better with 4. I don't want to encourage the wrong ones to watch this. It is not for children!

When it arrived, I told my brother & hubby, ""Look, I am not sure what to expect from this movie, I didn't get a rating, so if it is too much, I'll shut it down. But, I know it is a true haunting.""  They both wanted to check it out and we watched it all the way through.
They liked it, but it scared them to know it was real. They both knew my history and I gained some respect from each of them for what I went through. I told few people at the time, knowing they would think me crazy. My Christian Agent, stayed with me one night after I broke down & told him what was going on. Well, I made a believer out of him, but he took over and cleaned the house for a couple of days. I had two young teenagers that I sent to live with their father until I could get out of the lease. I feared for their safety. I wasn't really scared for myself the first six months. I knew I had angels looking over me too for a while. But, the darker it got and my not doing anything about it, I was in a war zone of my own, feeling on my own. So, short of two years later, every thing seemed to escalate & my children became afraid. My point is, these things do happen, to good people. I just wasn't as good at the time. I was angry at God over my divorce, some deaths and other things, and took my eyes off of Him.

My only problem with the right help, is having to go through the Catholic Church for approval, when it can take months. At times, that is too late. So, I say find a holy, bold, Evangelical Pastor, that follows the scriptures that gives us dominion over these evil spirits. But, those too, can be hard to find.

The horror is real, very real and although I am a Christian, I lived in a haunted house for two & a half years. Therefore, I know these things happen, but I do not encourage anybody to test the spirits or get involved with the dark side. Yes, there is a dark world out there. This movie was very accurate, as I remember it. Well acted, but maybe just a tinge of embelishment, but not too much. It was a hell on earth. I was so thrilled they had the sense to call in the Warrens.

If you want to be scared, then buy the movie, but never forget, it was real, it happened and still happens today, but even more. So, if you watch it, do not be tempted in any way, unless it is to turn in the right direction. There are only two directions, that's up or down. I recommend it for educational reasons, or if you are going through any haunting yourself. Again, I do caution all who watch it.",1390694400,3,2887,4.031413612565445

I had a feeling I should have rented The Conjuring before purchasing the DVD; instead I listened to friends and read 4 and 5-star reviews.
My own fault. No one broke my arm.

How can anyone compare The Conjuring to The Exorcist?
There IS no comparison. The Exorcist is a terrifying, excellently acted, well-made movie. For any era.

The Conjuring is somewhat scary. I didn't jump, flinch, or feel that 'look-over-my-shoulder,' way, once the movie ended.
What I felt was cheated. A waste of 15.00.

'Based on true events.'

Obviously there are stories, yes, even horror, based on true events. Of course many scenes are fictitious. Normally, people don't keep tabs on their lives, 24/7, so fiction is necessary.
I'd bet 85-90% of The Conjuring is fiction.

Based on true events is also a lie. One example is Blair Witch Project. They said it was a true story. We went to the theater, paid a small fortune to see it. TRUE, my a$$!. Not only was it untrue, it was terrible.
I do not consider movies, with a 'shaky camera,' well-made.
I purchased BWP book..the cover reads. FICTION.

The Warrens: The couple who vowed the house is in Amityville was haunted..demons lurked in every corner. Those who believe Amityville Horror is a true story are, well, naive. LOL.

The scene that irked me in The Conjuring was their discussion about the exorcist.

Before an exorcism, the alleged 'possessed' person must see doctors, psychiatrists and an authorized Bishop and/or Vatican need be notified, NOT any Catholic Church. An Exorcist MUST be given permission which can take months to years to be granted. IF granted.

I haven't seen The Exorcist in ages, but I think there's a part where Chris McNeil/Ellen Burstyn asks Father Damien Karras how to go about getting an exorcism. He replies, 'you have to go back in a time machine,' or some such phrase then explains all that's required..The amount of work involved.
In other words, a person has a better chance winning Lotto than finding an actual exorcist and being granted permission.

The Warrens make it sound simple like they did in the movie, Amityville. Research should be done before making an alleged non-fiction movie.

All in all, I do not feel The Conjuring deserved all the hype or 5-stars. I might have given a higher rating if it wasn't labeled true. I don't like liars.

The story is actually about the Warrens..

5405054,5,B00AAA62TI,"The plot of this film seems like just another haunted house film.  A nice family moves into an old house and nasty things start happening.  We've seen this everywhere from 13 Ghosts to The Amityville Horror.  The thing that makes this film so interesting is that is is based on truth: this is the worst case investigated by real-life ""demonologists"" Ed and Lorraine Warren.  The fact that this is based on truth automatically puts it a head above most other films of this type.  Also the direction by James Wan starts slowly and builds up the tension gradually until the last 30 or 40 minutes when  the film shifts into high gear and all hell breaks loose.  I really liked Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmuga as the real-life Warrens.  (Farmuga is also outstanding as the legendary Mrs. Bates on the cable series ""Bates Motel."")
The blu-ray features 3 short special features including interviews with the real Perron family, the family terrorized in this film.  There is also segment on the real Warrens.  The real Lorraine Warren is interviewed prominently  during this segment (Ed Warren is deceased.)  It is actually nice to see the real people whose story was seen in this film.  Sadly the blu-ray features no deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.

5405084,1,B00AAA62TI,"*SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*

To start off, I love horror movies and I was looking forward to this after all the praise it got, but after seeing it I think I have lost a little faith in humanity when a huge populace considers this a good horror flick. I don't mind the paranormal horror movie trend that has been going on for the past 5-6 years now and this movie had serious potential, but there were just too many flaws. The worst part is that I am a huge James Wan fan for his work in the original Saw movie and Dead Silence terrified me the first time I saw it.

So, what were the problems?

To start off, this movie is shot in a way like it was someone's college final, but with a larger budget. The clapping scene with Lili Taylor in the basement was beyond cheesy and actually made me laugh out loud. I hated Starwars: Episode I because of the abusive amount of CGI George Lucas used, but, in The Conjuring's case, it seriously could have used some in order to make it, you know, more supernatural. The scene where the witch lady jumps from the wardrobe was extremely lame and the only scene I felt genuinely creeped out was when Lili Taylor was possessed.

One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it took itself way too seriously to the point that it's comical. Now, don't get me wrong, I love horror movies with a blend of comedy (Evil Dead 2, Cabin in the Woods, etc...), but The Conjuring obviously isn't trying to be funny. The monologue halfway through the movie makes it seem so pretentious because of the sudden mood shift. As in, ""oh, this movie is so scary that we need a happier change of pace for the sake of the audience."" There are so many horror cliche's that it made many scenes extremely predictable - the dog senses evil and doesn't want to go in the house because it's scared has been done how many times again?

Now for my biggest complaint - Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. These two absolutely ruined this entire movie with their abysmal acting. Every single line of dialogue said by them made me want to pull the hair out of my skull. I wouldn't have minded the cliche scenes if these two weren't cast in this movie. Obviously, there is that whole ""personal tastes"" thing and more power to the people who get scared from this movie, but, to the people who are looking for something ""different,"" - stay away.",1389484800,7,2347,4.373853211009174
5405085,4,B00AAA62TI,"It was done fairly well,good acting and all that. But it was more of the same,just a lot of sound affects and spooky music,not terrifying at all.  It's entertainment and that's about all. I thought Salems Lot was a lot better.",1389484800,,226,4.512195121951219
5405086,5,B00AAA62TI,"Horror has been a mainstay of cinema since the silent movie era.  You wouldn't think there would be anything to add to the genre but ""The Conjuring"" contradicts that theory.  The beauty of James Wan's film is it references old films with a modern touch.  I spotted the influence of the classic Hammer films, Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"", and, yes, William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"".  I think what distinguishes this film from others of its ilk is its humanity.  We actually have characters to root for instead of a bloodfeast.  When the tormented family's dog is killed by the malevolent force you cry along with the kids.  When the mother(Lili Taylor) is possessed by same entity you feel the pain of her kin.  I think what elevates the film is its two main characters, Ed and Larraine Warren)Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga), married paranormalists who along with the love for one another share a religious conviction.  The Warrens are based on real persons and I would love to see them in future cinematic ventures.  ""The Conjuring"" is an intelligent film that I would wholeheartedly recommend to even those who are not horror buffs.",1389484800,,1133,4.884816753926701

This movie should be awarded with an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Patrick Wilson in my opinion.

5405103,1,B00AAA62TI,"In 1971, Roger, Carolyn, and their daughters move to an old farmhouse in Rhode Island. Everything is fine and dandy on the first day, but the next day brings odd events. Carolyn wakes up with weird bruises and the family dog is found dead outside. The weird happenings increase and Carolyn is attacked in the middle of the night and locked in the cellar. The family contacts paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren,who ascertain that an exorcism might be needed. They need to collect proof to send to the Catholic Church before anything can be done. It looks as if the church won't respond in time to save the family, so the Warrens and the family are on their own to save themselves.

The Conjuring is set in the 70's and a throwback to 70's horror films. It doesn't bring anything new to horror and relies to much on cheap jump scares for my taste. Parts of the film are very atmospheric and scary. My favorite part is where Carolyn is awoken in the middle of the night and lured into the basement by disembodied clapping only to be attacked. The scene was used as an extended trailer and made me excited to watch the film. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the only part of the film I really liked. The film was quite predictable and wasn't surprising in any positive way.

The film was surprising in a number of negative ways. First of all, the writers of the film, Chad and Carey Hayes, wrote this film as religious propaganda and it definitely shows. Faith is brought up in extremely obvious dialog multiple times and the entire film just boils down to a very simple good vs. evil story where faith triumphs over evil. The treatment of women is painfully apparent that the lens of the film is one of conservatism and religion. The evil spirit only directly attacks women. Women have been known in the Bible to be weaker then men and more susceptible to evil, causing original sin and things of that nature. On the night the evil starts, Carolyn initiates sex with her husband and we all know how well the Bible treats seductresses. This act basically ushers the evil in to her and of course the husband is merely an innocent bystander in the situation. Watching the misogyny on the screen was infuriating.

The villain of the film is Bathsheba, an evil witch who sacrifices children to Satan. Even after her death, she has been possessing women and manipulating them into killing their children and/or themselves. It's fun to look at the biblical Bathsheba. King David spied her in her bath, fell in love with her, and seduced her. Then he tried to cover up his sin by ordering the death of her husband. I find it particularly ironic that this evil, child-murdering female is named after a woman who was objectified and victimized by a powerful man and probably raped.

The last offensive thing about the film is the treatment of the Salem witch trials. The film puts forth that real witches were killed for the greater good. Not one little comment was made to say that innocent people died at all. Bathsheba could have committed suicide to save herself from a much more agonizing death being burned at the stake. I understand making history fit a story, but justifying the deaths of innocent people is pretty disgusting.

The Conjuring is a misogynistic and offensive film. Even without reading anything into the story, it's merely derivative of so many other things out there and doesn't do anything new or interesting. I don't understand why so many people seem to love this flat propagandist film.",1389312000,12,3510,4.65483870967742

While the story line isn't perfect (I didn't love the way they too the last 30 minutes), it is pretty darn good (not FULL of holes like ""Mama"").  The pacing and building of tension kept me on the edge of my seat in many scenes-leaping out of it in at least a couple.  A few things put this movie above other similar ones for me: 1) the development of the characters-without slowing the movie down, you get a good sense of the main characters and care what happens to them. 2) There is no sex, or ""horror-porn""-style gore or torture, which makes it fine for those who dislike those elements or even possibly for older children who won't be too scared by its [SPOILER ALERT] suggestions that demons can live among us. 3) It is very atmospheric in its depiction of the house and its grounds and New England.

I liked it a lot considering as others have stated, this movie shows u can make a horror film without constant cursing, sex and even gore.  The one issue I had is as with other movies, the portrayal of a ""witch"".  This film, to no surprise considering the Warrens are Catholics from the look of it, or at the least, Christian, they make a witch out to be a Satan worshiping evil hag.  In truth, if you knew anything about witchcraft, past and present, you wouldn't buy into that because witches don't believe in Satan so how could they worship Satan?

Horror is my favorite genera but I'm really picky, it seems too many of todays horror films are not scary so they put adult themes and excessive gore in to get that 'R' rating, the rating a lot of horror fans for some reason don't see in theaters without.  This one steered clear of those and still managed to get a R rating.

I personally would not let a child watch this move, so the R rating is justified.  It had a lot of good 'jump' moments and the acting was well done.

5405208,5,B00AAA62TI,"Set in 1971, the story is said to have been inspired by the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a husband-and-wife team of paranormal investigators. ""The Conjuring"" introduces us quickly to the Warrens, (played by Patrick Wilson as Ed and Vera Farmiga as Lorraine). The couple believe in the occult, but understand that most events are easily explained hoaxes. They lecture at colleges, show film of inexplicable supernatural events and try to determine, with all the false alarms, if there is a credible case to investigate. Lorraine is clairvoyant, which means she sees what most people cannot, i.e., the apparitions which go ""bump in the night.""  Ed may be a believer, but hes also the pragmatist - applying pre-digital technology, (meters to locate and quantify electromagnetic hot & cold spots, motion sensors, monitor-like geiger counters), etc.. in his search for proof of what they're dealing with. Since the film and the actual event take place in 1971, you will find no state-of-the-art ghost detection technology here.

The story centers around the Perron family, (with Lili Taylor as Carolyn and Ron Livingston as  Roger Perron). The couple, along with their five boisterous  daughters, have the misfortune of moving into their dream house, a rickety 150-year-old Rhode Island farm house, which, they quickly discover, is infested by malevolent, vengeful spirits intent on tormenting and/or killing them. The family dog, Sadie, refuses to enter the house, which should have clued the Perrones in that something weird was going on. They ultimately call upon the aid of Ed and Lorraine Warren, who agree to lend their expertise once the haunting appears to be legitimate. Soon they are moving in with the couple and their daughters.

The Warren's discover, through research, that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba, who tried to sacrifice her children to the devil and killed herself in 1863 after cursing all who would take her land.

Well, what a challenge this turns out to be! I was truly scared during several scenes...and I am not easily frightened. This is definitely NOT a blood and gore film. However, The Conjuring, does have some very terrifying moments. With its minimal use of digital effects, director James Wan uses his expertise with the camera work. It is active, erratic and enhances the dread. Often, hell switch perspective in the middle of the scenes, where it will cast doubt as to whose eyes were looking through, and in other moments it will shift from one person to the next, so the viewer doesn't know if the ""point of view"" is human or otherwise!

There are moments when the story does lose credibility. Its climax, for instance, involves an amateur Catholic exorcism that makes The Exorcist,  seem like a chronicled event. But the scares that the film delivers, are deeply, deeply creepy, and consistently satisfying. You want ""Horror,"" well, this is ""Horror!"" ""The Conjuring"" is much more than a run--of-the-mill scary-tale.

The most important measure of a horror movie is to disgust, disturb, shock and/or terrify. ""The Conjuring"" does all this, and it is a well acted, well made, fascinating tale to boot. I highly recommend it.

5405210,5,B00AAA62TI,"OK, facts aside, this move is a big exaggeration from the true story. Most movies have to be this way in order to be interesting though. I think where this movie stands out is creepy Annabelle doll intro story and using legit scare tactics as opposed to cheesy ones used in the Paranormal Activity series. Also, letting you use some imagination before the frightening begins was great.

They casted this movie really well. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do an excellent job at playing Ed and Lorraine Warren as well as giving hope just when you begin to think that the Perron family is doomed. Speaking of the Perron family, the girls that play the daughters are all unknowns and do a superb job in the movie. One of the biggest overlooked stars is Lili Taylor, who plays the ultimate victim in this movie. I must say, I haven't been thrilled with many horror flicks in years.

5405218,4,B00AAA62TI,"Big Question- Before Christianity and Latin existed how did exorcists exorcise??? A lingering question after watching The Conjuring, a film by James Wan.

The age of Scary Movie-esque franchises has turned seeing dead people and being haunted by and evil spirits into mundanely comic events. Sexy vampires, farcical zombies, and ridiculous inside jokes about the worlds end begone! The Conjuring is a big horror film that is actually good and scary. Finally!

Still, Director Wan uses all the old horror tricks to build up the suspense: creeping suggestive crescendos in the score, brief uncertain glimpses of unknown beings, and of course, lots of loud and unexpected jolts.

The film opens as the Perron family arrives at their new home, a large fixer-upper in the Rhode Island countryside. As the family starts their life in the new house the haunting becomes apparent. Clocks stop, doors slam, people scream. Terror drives the family to huddle up in the living room where they spend their nights sleeping together. It makes the spirits calmer, they say.

A little too conveniently, famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren just so happen to be speaking nearby. Mrs. Perron persuades the Warrens to come inspect the house. Lorrain Warren, a kind of clairvoyant, senses real trouble in the Perron house immediately. Using cameras, Holy magic, and Latin scriptures, the fight begins to save not only the house from destruction, but the people inside it as well.

5405281,5,B00AAA62TI,"This movie is full of great scares. Rated R for those chills, I am certain, as there is no nudity and no sex. That is unless you object to a peck on the check between a husband and wife and passing comment by wife that one could infer was about them having made love the night before. If, as I do, have a teenager who likes spooky movies and will not be overly frightened (have to know your kid) this movie will give them a great thrill also.  Based on a true story, from the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren (she is a clairvoyant), the demonologists, paranormal investigators--it starts with brief look at one of their other cases. According to the actual family involved and Lorraine Warren, aside from a few liberties taken for ""cinematic effect"", the basic happenings are true. A minor example of this, the doll shown in movie is super creepy, the real life, just Raggedy Ann (equally as creepy because of its ordinary guise for some, but not Hollywood. Again, with a teen, if they don't really believe that these things are real (mine believes in God, devil, etc. but not that ghosts or demon possession as real) they will get over scare quicker. For those of you (us) who believe in the paranormal, you may need a night light for a few nights after watching (and that teen should probably not watch). As a footnote, there is a fair amount of foul expletives, the worst being G.d., and Jesus called out and not in a prayer, but my kid knows not to say those things and understands that some people use that language regularly or when excited, so again, know your own kid.",1388188800,,1575,4.449826989619377

5405311,5,B00AAA62TI,"Most Horror films these days require gore or forecast their few scares in trailers, making the eventual viewing a disappointment, at best. Not The Conjuring.

Despite quite a few of the startling moments being released in trailers, the viewers aren't robbed at all, as the quality of the script, eerie score, and premise for the content set them up so well that even knowing they are coming doesn't make them less scary! Also, the trailer clips don't contain the downright creepiest moments in the film, which are the ones containing the haunted doll: Annabelle. As a veteran horrow guy, I am rarely entertained by most of what is issued as ""horror"", but this film is in a class not seen since the 60's/70's. Even Exorcist III wasn't nearly as good as this film. That is not an exaggeration.

One detraction I observed was that the film, at times, had a ""documentary"" feel to it, which is fine, but it wasn't consistent. I will need to watch it again to see if it only took place when the Warrens were part of the action. As you know, some films take that approach, especially to convey a sense of reality and validity to aspects of a film, but the deliniation wasn't clear in this film.

Despite the claims of some that film was scarier than most because of the attributed claim that it is based on true events, well, I think that's not true. While I do believe that aspects of the film may have been true, I think it was a frightening group of scenes, regardless! The screenplay, storyline, and acting combined to make this an absolute worthy film of owning, by my definition, which is whether I want to see this film again and again.

Unfortunately, very few film makers manage to finish what they start. The Conjuring was clever and original up to a point, and then the standard issue exorcism ruined it. There are two problems with that approach: 1) It's been done to death a million times; and 2) It isn't a tiny bit scary. If you've seen The Exorcist, you've seen the Alpha and Omega of exorcism movies. There is no reason to watch a retread.

5405340,3,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring"" is a disappointing example of a good horror movie that's prevented from being a great one by a bad ending.  It merges a haunted house story with a tale of possession that has several moments of true spine-tingling horror.  But it's almost ruined by an ending that resolves the possession far too easily and leaves everyone living happily ever after.  The devil doesn't necessarily have to win for a possession movie to work, but it should at least end in a tie with the demonic spirit relinquishing control of its victim at the cost of taking another life or leaving everyone involved deeply scarred",1387843200,,614,4.773584905660377

There were several ""scares"" where I just wanted to laugh.

5405358,5,B00AAA62TI,"Horror movies lately have gone the way of parody films.  No one knows how to properly do them anymore, and most don't even try.  Compare old classic horror films like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th to their respective reboots and you'll instantly notice that new horror film directors don't actually know what ""horror"" means and try to fill the screen time with gore, gratuitous nudity, silly jump scares and/or annoying shaky-cam.

That's why I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  Not only it avoids those pitfalls (it does have a few jump scares, but they're not cheap or unnecessary), it manages to actually tell a good story that can actually scare you.  It might not make you jump from your seat or hide under the covers (it depends on what kind of person you are, really), but it will at the very least creep you out and leave you with an uneasy feeling several times.

The first thing you want to do is ignore the ""Based on a true story"" sign.  That's either purposefully misleading or an outright lie, for obvious reasons.  Furthermore, it doesn't matter, since it doesn't add or take from your enjoyment of the story.

The plot is, quite frankly, nothing new.  A family moves to a secluded house in the woods and it turns out to be haunted, so they contact a somewhat famous paranormal-investigators couple to help them with their problem before they're driven insane.  The plot bringing nothing new to the table isn't really a bad thing, since it's all about the execution.

For starters, the movie counts with an amazing cast.  No superfamous stars or silly Disney TV rejects here.  Everyone, from the youngest to the oldest does a great job with their role.  The visual style of the movie is also very appealing.  The visuals on the movie and the make-up job are excellent, and the little CGI there is does a great job, and it's only used when necessary.

Second, the characters here are well represented.  While they're kind of a clich (specially the family), they're actually interesting and likable people.  They're clich, but they're not one-note.  This is very important, since it marks one of the reasons this movie is not like the awful horror films of later years: you actually care about these characters.  For instance, the paranormal investigators are actually shown to be people who thoroughly investigate the cases to make sure there actually IS something paranormal occuring.  Most movies will just claim these guys are always right and rational people are always wrong, but here, the couple recognizes that most cases of ghosts, spirits or haunting are actually tricks played on people by their own minds.  This marks an important distinction, since in most ""horror"" films these days you hate the main characters so much that you end up rooting for the villain.

Third, I can't state this enough: this movie is REALLY creepy.  There are some parts that will give you goosebumps and make you see things that aren't there.  The end shows up pictures of the actual people this film is based on.  Those old-time pictures are usually quite creepy by themselves, more so here.  There are small bits of the story that are left unexplained, which actually adds to the overall mysterious feel of the films, unlike other films, that leave you thinking ""What the hell?"" here the lack of specific details only adds to the film's appeal.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say there are some times when the movie makes you think it's going to do one of those groan-inducing bad-horror-flick clichs, but it turns out to be something different.

So, again, I think it's a pretty sweet film.  As a last note, the quality of the Blu Ray picture and audio is great.  I haven't checked the extras yet, so I don't know how good they are, but they seem to be a sizable chunk.  If you have a Blu Ray player, that's the way to watch it.",1387756800,2,3867,4.689910979228487

Clairvoyants are familiar with this phenomenon as it manifests in families and places where violence has occurred.  ""Ghosts"" and ""hauntings"" are rarely equated with witchcraft, but are easily found in locations where unspeakable violence and cultural genocide (as in slavery and the Holocaust) has occurred.

5405382,5,B00AAA62TI,"Since people have had the ability to tell stories, they've liked to scare one another. Monsters and goblins, ghouls and ghosts; it's all in good fun, or at least it used to be. Ever since William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (which is still the gold standard in supernatural terror), stories of ghosts and demons have gotten a little less fun and a lot more nihilistic. And while THE EXORCIST has moments where you can catch your breath and have a little fun with the characters, more and more films lately have been notching up the fear factor until you just can't breathe at all, and these films end up being more of an exercise in endless panic and utter nihilism than a smart and well-balanced scary movie. But every once in a great while in the horror genre, there comes a film that allows fear to creep in around the edges rather than constantly erupting all over the audience and James Wan's THE CONJURING is one of those rare films.

It begins with a prologue, first detailing that this is based on a true story, starting in 1969 of the husband-wife paranormal investigator team of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as they investigate some very creepy goings-on with a very creepy doll that has been possessed. Then, onward to 1971, where we meet the Perron family, a clean-cut cute family with mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and father Roger (Ron Livingston) and their five young daughters moving into an old farmhouse in New England. Everything seems idyllic until things start... happening. Loud thumping, smells of rotting meat, strange and creepy objects, tugs on the legs of the children, inexplicable brusing, until the madness implodes one night and they come in search of people that will believe them, and more importantly, help them. This leads them to the Warrens. Of this couple, Ed is the more logical and pragmatic of the couple, looking to actually leave this life behind them for a while so they can spend more time with their daughter. Lorraine is the emotional core, though, who leads with her heart and her apparent extrasensory abilities, and knows that the Perrons need them. Things go back to normal (or so it seems) when the Warrens and their investigative team enter the house, but things quickly start to go very badly for both families as the source of the mystery of this house is solved, and the house, and the evil spirit contained within, begins fighting back.

What makes this film special is the nature of how things progress. Everything seems, for lack of a better term, real. It takes the ages-old haunted house tale, and makes it somewhat procedural in nature. The investigation by the Warrens and their team is something that doesn't seem to be part of many of these types of films. Everything seems to have its place. The film also allows us to care about the families by learning about them outside of just the otherworldly threat. They have everyday conversations; they have problems that people can relate to other than just sharing a paranormal event and Wan is smart enough to include those moments. It makes it scarier to the audience to have people we care about in danger rather than just showing the audience people in danger and have them try and form an emotional connection with them. This is old-school horror filmmaking and it's kind of glorious, particularly coming from the director who introduced us to the SAW franchise. Performance-wise, pretty much everyone is at the top of their game, particularly the leading ladies of Farmiga and Taylor.

There are certain elements that are seem a little too pat, such as the investigation into the history of the house, but this is a pretty economical film in terms of exposition. It wants to concentrate as much on the characters as it does the mystery and the terror of the situations, another rarity in horror. If anything, this film is something of the heir-apparent to the last truly great haunted-house film, Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg's POLTERGEIST. It blends all of the elements of strong storytelling without going too far and leaving us without hope, as most of the modern horror films are won't to do. It also seems like it relies much more on practical effects rather than the over-use of CG effects, which is also a nice change of pace. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why this film is R-Rated. There's no real gore that you couldn't see on network TV, not really any ""suggestive dialogue"", and zero nudity. This wouldn't be a film I would invite a seven-year-old to see, but there seems to be no reason other than it seems to be made smarter and for a more mature audience than most of the PG-13 horror that tends to clog up the cinemas.

THE CONJURING is one of the best haunted house films in a long time, and a film that gives us hope that people can still make scary films that are also intelligent and fun.

5405402,4,B00AAA62TI,"Good news! The film industry has come to realize that there is a solid audience for genuinely creepy spooky movies, and that these movies are not about big budgets, computer generated effects, or blockbuster stars.  The Conjuring is very scary.  Every spooky scene delivers, and this film is filled with spooky scenes from beginning to end.  There are few things scarier than dark rooms, shadows, and things that go bump in the night.  I was especially impressed with the many references to previous horror classics.  Many scenes borrow the unseen ghostly activities you see in the Paranormal Activity movies.  I'm not sure when music boxes first became scary, but there is a scary music box in this film and it is as effective as its predecessors in Burnt Offerings, the Changeling, and the Innocents.  The loud bumping in the Conjuring is reminiscent of Robert Wise's the Haunting.  There is even a scary school bus sound that must be a reference and tribute to the Central Park scene in Val Lewton's the Cat People. Generally the acting was appropriately understated which is consistent with the documentary feel of the film.  Nevertheless Patrick Wilson was a little cold and stiff as Ed Warren.  Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren was warmer but her vintage 1971 clothes and hair styles were a bit off putting and distracting.  I could nit-pick and wonder who in his or her right mind would purchase the doll in the opening scenes of the movie.  No matter.  This movie is about strange noises in the middle of the night in a dark, desolate house with a diabolical past.  The Conjuring will scare you.",1387324800,,1602,4.799270072992701
5405403,4,B00AAA62TI,"I saw The Conjuring in the movie theater back in July. I remember that within the first half hour I knew I was going to add this to my Blu ray collection once it came out in the format. The theater was packed and I don't think a horror film works as effectively when you're seeing it with hundreds of people ( at least for me ). The crowd was well behaved, don't get me wrong. Except for a group of teenage girls who walked out of the theater while giggling to themselves. Perhaps the movie was too much for them? Ha!

Viewing this film in the dark, home alone at 2 a.m. is a better experience in my opinion. It's not a huge film. It's a small scale story that is done with the kind of technical expertise and ingenuity that comes from filmmakers who were raised on this genre. The cinematography and editing can't be faulted.

As for the narrative, I haven't seen this many horror movie tropes and cliches in one film, maybe ever. That doesn't make the film bad. It just goes to show you that these old tricks of the trade still work after being utilized for decades. The set up of the film is the same basic thing we've all seen countless times before, even from this very director, ( he seems to never tire of paranormal investigators ). A family moves into a country house with a long history. Things go bump in the night, then accelerate in intensity until the family seeks the help of these investigators.

It's incredible that the filmmakers can get away with a story that has been done to death hundreds of times. But remember, most people under the age of 18 aren't familiar with the 1970s horror cinema this movie rips off from, ( is inspired by, to be more forgiving). And those movies are too old and crusty for kids to go back to. This is exactly that kind of 70s horror film but with a modern sheen and polish. That speaks to the power of the horror genre that a film with no originality, that could have been conceived 40 years ago, is a big hit with a modern audience.

Audiences over the age of 25 might be bored with The Conjuring. But older people just need to put this film in the right context and enjoy all the chills and thrills this genre has to offer. The biggest disappointment for me was... ( SPOILER WARNING ), that the movie morphs from a ghost story to an exorcist thriller in the third act. That annoyed me greatly, because I love ghost stories, I can even tolerate stories about demons, but possession and exorcism bores me to no end. We're going back to The Exorcist again. Yawn. But within the aesthetic that The Conjuring is operating in, ( 1970s era horror thriller ), an exorcist angle is just the next natural progression. People who like exorcist stories will enjoy this third act much more than I did. I love ghost stories and prefer that angle.

Technical notes about the Blu ray. The film looks terrific. It was shot on the Arri Alexa, a digital cinema camera, but one can be fooled that it was shot on 35mm film. The transfer is fantastic, the sound is of high quality. I also like the lenticular slipcover that this came with. I bought my copy at that major electronics store with the yellow/blue logo. I don't know if the Amazon Blu ray comes with a lenticular slipcover or not. Someone make a comment about that.

If you liked this movie, I would like to recommend ""The Haunted"". It's a made for TV movie from 1991 and it has a very similar tone to The Conjuring. The Haunted was made on a far smaller budget but I think the atmosphere in that movie is rather more effective than the easy, cheap scares that The Conjuring loves. You can find The Haunted on that popular video sharing website that starts with you and ends with tube. Enjoy!",1387324800,3,3685,4.364431486880466

When it comes to true paranormal/demonic possession movies its very interesting to me. I have come to the conclusion that if you play with this stuff that it will ruin your life. Don't mess with something you don't understand. Never know what's on the other side of that door waiting to be unleashed. The inhuman spirit (a spirit that has never walked the earth in human form) was new to me. I had never heard of that before and never thought anything like that could exist, interesting.

5405426,4,B00AAA62TI,"I'd heard about mixed reports about this film, but I'm always interested in a new horror film so had to at least give it a try. It's not a great film by any means, but it wasn't as bad as I'd heard either. The main issue is the story, there's nothing there that hasn't been done a thousand times before. A family move into a new form and are terrorised by a malevolent spirit. A man and a wife who have dedicated  their lives to investigating and where needed removing evil spirits.

While the story might not be anything new it is told well, the level of presentation is very high. The characters are all well played (I'm a big fan of the mother from Bates Motel and she does a good job here as well) and balance the experiences of the film with suitably different perspectives.

The effects and camera work are also strong, so while it might not be new it is very watchable. The horror is not unusual, strange movements in the dark, smells the usual collection of tropes, but again they build upon each other in a polished fashion.

So while it's far from the greatest horror ever made, it is an entertaining film and worth watching.",1387065600,,1135,4.3649289099526065

James Wan is the director of The Conjuring. He has also directed other movies, such as Saw and Insidious. This director directed many scary movies. The Conjuring demonstrates Mr. Wan talent in scary movies.

This movie was directed very well because the movie does not rely on the so-call jump scare, where either someone or an object pops out when everything is either silent or when the audience is not expecting it. Most scary movies rely on the jump scare. This movie relies on being scary throughout the movie. It makes the audience think about the what if scenarios, such as, what if this happens to me. The mother of the family gets possess by the demon and begins to harm the family. By the end of the movie, it will leave the audience with a spooky feeling.",1386547200,,1174,4.666666666666667

5405479,4,B00AAA62TI,"Written by Chad Hayes/Carey W Hayes, Produced by Tony DeRosa-Grund/Peter Safran/Rob Cowan and Directed by James Wan.

A horror thriller well cinematographed and presented based on a true story.
The Perron family (Roger Perron and Carolyn Perron with their five daughters) moves into a newly acquired farm house in the countryside which is actually infested with a demon of the landlady (Bathsheba) who was once the owner of the farm house and who also used to practice witch-craft. She commits suicide after trying to offer her own child as a sacrifice in her practice. Her 200 acre cursed farm house is acquired by different people over a period of time but the witch still hangs around in the cellar of the large house driving away whoever occupies the same. The witch possesses Carolyn and tries to kill her children..
This is when Warren and his wife Lorraine (experts in demonology and un-official exorcists) are approached by Perron to exorcise the witch from the house. After employing different techniques Warren and Lorraine finally exorcise the demon from the possessed Carolyn as well as the house successfully, in the nick of the moment when she the later was just about to kill Christine and solve another complicated case.

Director of Photography and Sound Effects should be congratulated for their exemplary special effects and real horror experience. Even the bravest of hearts would pound at least once while watching this film. The director has given the film an ethnic look by fitting everything so well that one gets a feeling that he/she is transported to the times in 1970s and enjoy the horror thrill. Best audio visual effects guaranteed if viewed on a big screen/Blue Ray with 5.1 surround sound system.

Since the story line is not new, the movie is something like Old Wine in a New Bottle, but still enjoyable with entire family..Reminds one of the old time super hit The Exorcist.

As a former Catholic, I love films involving exorcisms and demonic possession. Great casting and acting all around. I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan who enjoys a good ghost story, possessions, exorcisms, and scary effects rather than exploitative gore (although I do enjoy a good blood bath).",1386374400,,569,4.876288659793815

5405489,3,B00AAA62TI,"Have to say that ultimately I was disappointed with this film. I had built up quite an anticipation to viewing this film once available on DVD due to the hype, buzz, and promotion when released to theaters. But having just viewed it last night, I came away scratching my head, wondering what all the fuss was about.

The Conjuring is just another film in the Amityville Horror vein, with nothing new brought to the table and nothing to make it really stand out of said genre. True, genuine scares are few and far between, and the film suffers from a very slow beginning.

However, after about the first 1/2 hour, things do pick up. A bigger budget than usual for films of this ilk does allow for some impressive special effects. Lili Palmer, Vera Farmiga, and Patrick Wilson do a good job in their respective roles.

Overall, The Conjuring was a mixed experience - I don't regret the two hours spent with this film, but I guess I let myself get caught up in the hype surrounding this movie. It's certainly not one of the scariest movies of all time nor an original story (again, its title could have been The Amityville Horror - 2013), but its fine cast and occasional creepy moments make it worth a viewing.",1386374400,,1208,4.532110091743119

Well, if you knew 8 of your friends had just died by walking out of the house, would you follow them? Probably not. But that's how most horror movies go: You find yourself yelling at the screen ""NO! Don't do that!"" Well, this movie is different. Everything that happens has a logical explanation. I found myself saying ""Well, that sucks, but I probably would've done the same thing... there was no choice."" So that makes the movie that much scarier, because you can see it happening to you!

Ultimately, the truth that runs throughout the movie is the most unsettling.

Imagine the old Hammer horror films from the 50's and 60's......multiplied by 10 fold! You may get the idea.

I'm convinced the few negative reviews are from the likes of the Freddy Kruger, Jason, slasher fan-boys that are neutered to real Gothic terror and horror.

All I heard is how this is not only one of the scariest movies of all time but maybe the best since the Exorcist. I heard from my friends and read reviews on how this is one of the scariest movies of all time.

Well people need to get out of the house more often. I have seen way scarier movies then these piece of garbage and I get more scared on things like Ghost Adventures. I heard the first 30 minutes of the movie is the scariest.

Whatever. Took like almost a hour to even to get a somewhat of a scary scene.

I don't how even anybody can compare this movie as good as the Exorcist. Not even on the same planet. I am glad I got to see this movie for free thru my cable company. This is by far the worst scary movie of all time. The only thing scary about this movie is if they even consider a part 2.

This is the most overrated and overhyped movie of all time. Not one time did I jump out of my seat or get goosebumps. Normally after I watch a good scary movie,I am the type of person that will look around the house and corners and kinda watch things at the corner of my eye. Not one time on this movie.

This movie might have had a shot if they did it years ago like around the time of the Exorcist or even it the 90's. But after all these years with movies like The Ring,Exorcism of Emily Rose,The Shining,It,etc.,there was really no point. Especially after the Ring. All of the scary movies over the past decade have been pretty much the same story line.

And if you like a good slasher movie,this is not it(which is funny. I have heard so many complaints that it is not a slasher movie. I did not get that feeling from the previews).

I just cant believe that this movie has gotten so many positive reviews and everyone talking about how scary it is. I have gotten more scares out of American Horror Story then this crap.",1385683200,7,2090,4.055825242718447

5405546,4,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is *still* freaking me out!  Any film that reminds me of the Amityville Horror is bound to win me over in a HUGE way.  What the Conjuring does remarkably well is allow time to develop not only a story, but atmosphere and horror.  These are crucial details when it comes to horror films.  You can't just throw a bunch of children and teenage daughters together (5 of them to be exact) with a mom/dad and assume we'll all instantly attach/care about them.  You have to allow these characters to develop an identity which is what makes the Conjuring one of the better horror movies out there.  Certainly one of the best released in recent years.  Every one of the family members is given time to shine.

Actually what this movie does that the Amityville Horror does not (at least the original) is include moments of mystery in the storytelling.  It's not always 100% horror and scares.  Eventually the tone shifts in another direction which, in my opinion, is comparable to a mystery film.  With that said, the movie is most certainly a horror movie. The tone just sometimes goes in another direction perhaps unintentionally so to give viewers time to catch their breath.

Anyway the scares begin on a subtle and somewhat harmless note- the family experiences the occasional creeps of closet doors opening and crawling sounds/noises throughout the house, but soon other more serious things begin to happen.  Pictures slam off the walls, birds crash through the windows, visions of a hanging take place outside by a tree branch, bed sheets fly off the clothesline and form a human figure before oddly landing flat against the upstairs window playing with our imaginations since we're not entirely sure a thunderstorm is causing this to happen (one of my personal favorite moments), a young daughter wakes up crying because she believes someone is standing by her bedroom doorway which causes her sister to wake up and question her (second favorite moment) and well, the list goes on and on.

No, the Conjuring isn't as scary as the Amityville Horror.  It comes close on a few occasions, however.  It's absolutely delightful to watch and hear this movie on a DVD player with powerful speakers too.  Yes the film relies heavily on jump scares, but it also includes a remarkable amount of suspense and atmosphere.  The only reason I'm not giving the movie 5 stars is for a couple reasons.  One, the Exorcist portion of the film, though awesome and atmospheric, is somewhat generically written.  And well, the storyline overall is somewhat predictable of a haunted house with typical tendencies and the occasional cliches coming in now and then.  Otherwise, worth watching.

I do think there's one storyline flaw.  The mom/dad tell a visiting paranormal group that the entire family has to live downstairs in the living room because it's their only safe spot, however eventually the daughters go back to their bedrooms which is when the situation gets much worse.  I have a feeling the parents regret allowing their kids to return to their own rooms.  I think the basement and for that matter the entire house (due to the peeled brown wallpaper which was popular in the 70's I know) look believably creepy as well.

Actually, I thought Mama was creepier. If you thought The Conjuring was scary, try Mama. Scary, creepy, and Jessica Chastain was excellent, as were the 2 young girls.

The main problem with a movie like The Conjuring is that it assumes that none of us have ever been to a haunted house movie before (perhaps not an entirely unwarranted assumption given that the characters in these movies clearly never have or theyd know better than to move into one of these houses in the first place).

You know the drill. Unsuspecting family from the city buys an old place in the country. Weird things begin to happen. Ghostbusters are brought in to investigate. Turns out some restless spirits, the victims of various ghastly crimes in the past, are roaming around the place searching for someone to free them from their predicament so they can move on and find eternal peace. Supernatural pandemonium ensues. Roll credits. The End.

This one is set in 1971 (the girls are watching Brady Bunch reruns in the middle of the afternoon long before the show ever went into syndication, but then I doubt that facts are high on the agenda for these filmmakers). Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston play the parents of five daughters who become bedeviled by some evil forces lurking in the dark recesses of the creaky old fixer-upper theyve purchased in rural Rhode Island. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the world-famous paranormal researchers, the Warrens, who attempt to exorcise the demons from the place.

The kind of movie for which a spoiler alert is practically superfluous, The Conjuring is allegedly based on a true story, a come-on that might have been more convincing had the movie not seemed so much like every other haunted house movie weve ever seen. Id like to believe that even ghosts cant be this boringly predictable.

Maybe someday someone somewhere will come up with something new that will breathe some much-needed life into the genre. Till then, I guess, movies like The Conjuring - and there will be many more to come, Im sure - will just have to do.",1385424000,3,1894,4.779816513761468
5405557,5,B00AAA62TI,"""The Conjuring"" is based on a true story, specifically a case investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga), parapsychologists who made a career of examining and finding reasons for otherwise unexplainable occurrences. They have also participated in exorcisms.

Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston) have just moved into a new house with their five daughters. Initially thrilled with their large home, they gradually discover that all is not right with it. Creepy noises abound, a series of bruises appear on Carolyn with no apparent cause, one of the daughters has conversations with a new, unseen ""friend,"" and birds dive, kamikaze-like, into the windows and walls. Concerned for the safety of their family, the Perrons seek out the Warrens, pleading with them to visit the house and see for themselves what is happening.

The Warrens sense an evil presence and agree to help Carolyn and Roger clean house. With their assistant, Drew (Shannon Kook), and loads of cameras, microphones, tape recorders, and movement-sensors, they stake out the numerous rooms of the house. It doesn't take long for ever more dramatic incidents to transpire.

If the plot so far sounds suspiciously like ""Poltergeist,"" you're right. The film is essentially a haunted house tale given an interesting spin by its basis in fact.

The tendency of a viewer -- even a fan of horror -- is to be skeptical until a movie establishes suspension of disbelief. This never quite happens in ""The Conjuring,"" but director James Wan definitely knows how to build suspense and take his time developing tension. The Perrons are a normal family -- no wife beaters, ax murderers, or telekinetic kids among them -- so we identify fairly quickly as Wan unfolds the beginning of what turns out to be an unforeseeable living nightmare. The fact that there are so many children in the household amps the stakes. Is the house possessed or are dark forces targeting this family in particular?

Often, a haunted house film is greeted with the apt criticism, ""Why don't they just leave?""  This question is addressed in one exchange of dialogue. Roger tells the Warrens that the family doesn't have the financial resources to go to a hotel and, when asked if they could stay with friends, asks, ""Who's going to take in a family of seven indefinitely?""

The two female leads provide standout performances. Ms. Taylor's Carolyn is a caring mother with a great relationship with her kids and husband. As incidents and danger within the home escalate, she seems to be especially singled out by whatever is tormenting the house and family.  She morphs from protector to victim and vividly projects the abject terror she feels.

Ms. Farmiga, so excellent as the crazed mother on TV's ""Bates Motel,"" turns in the kind of nuanced performance seldom seen in horror movies. Her Lorraine is intelligent, devout, and dedicated to helping others.  Her clairvoyant ability makes her a valuable colleague for Ed, but the work has taken its toll in the past and the current case promises to be one of the most dangerous of their careers.

As horror films go, ""The Conjuring"" depends more on psychological terror and growing tension than monsters, gore, and gross-out images. It commands your full attention and envelops you in its carefully woven web of eeriness, the other worldly, and human vulnerability as it builds to a climax, at which point director Wan pulls out the stops to shock us with startling images and the characters' reactions. Despite a climactic scene that contradicts rules established earlier, the movie is a powerful exploration of the supernatural.

Rated R for some violent scenes, ""The Conjuring""  is the latest in the creepy old house sub-genre of horror films. Only many of the cliches are absent -- no ominous stranger warning the family away, nothing trapping the family within the house, no monsters, no last-minute natural explanation of seemingly supernatural events. Instead, we have a thoughtful picture with solid characters who act intelligently despite encroaching terror.",1385424000,,4087,5.100299401197605

How accurate those ""true events"" are, I'm not sure, but seeing that line seems to help the mental psych get into the film before it has started.

The Conjuring had some of the best ""scary movie acting"" that I've seen in a while. The kids in the movie were all great and I think it was their acting that really brought the movie around. The scenes were not too over the top to where it took away from the spook factor. Though I think it would have been better (more fun) having been seen in the theater - or with other people that scare easily. The ""jumpy"" scenes were spaced almost too far apart to where it seemed like you were waiting forever for something to happen. Hence, seeing it with a group of people might have made that part a little more exciting.

The story line really wasn't all the different from others. I still prefer Amityville Horror (original) over this simply because I liked the filming and script layout better.",1385337600,2,1101,4.392156862745098

The first time one sees a figure on top of a dressing piece, with the most scary look this side of a Halloween gone wrong, it is time to warm up the car and haul the children out the door, before the evil that lurks starts getting any more funny ideas that the whole family is going to be possessed by evil incarnate.

5405598,5,B00AAA62TI,In this day and age where gore and cgi have replaced tension and effective storytelling im happy to say i consider the conjuring a tremendous success. While many movies have forgotten that sometimes what is so terryfying is what the mind creates and not how much gore can be thrown on the screen the conjuring remembered. There are some cheap scares but not enough to ruin things. And although the narrative is based on a true story i still think it would be effective regardless. The acting was very well done as well. If your looking for a movie full of blood and gore then you will probally be dissapointed with the conjuring but if you enjoy a well told story that evokes that feeling of terror of what lies in the shadows then you will probally enjoy the conjuring.,1384905600,,770,4.507142857142857

5405606,5,B00AAA62TI,"Long before shows like ""Ghost Adventures"" and ""Paranormal State"", there was Ed and Lorraine Warren. Since the 1960's, the pair have been investigating and trying to help people afflicted by paranormal occurrences. This movie is based on a true story about one of their most terrifying experiences.

Half of The Conjuring is a fairly typical ghost/demon possession story. There isn't really anything new in the story itself. It's just your average ""family moves into a haunted house"" kind of thing. But, the movie is so well-done that I loved it. The acting is almost perfect. And the suspenseful bits are perfectly timed. I often caught myself quivering and hoping that the movie would end soon. Not because it was bad but because I was a little TOO terrified.

The other half of the movie is an abbreviated biography of the Warrens and what they do. They're portrayed as a likable young couple dedicated to helping the people who contact them. And, sometimes, the danger they and their loved ones have occasionally found themselves in because of what they do.

In my opinion, it's up there with ""Amityville Horror"" as one of the best movies of its type.

Fun fact: The real Lorraine Warren, who is now in her 80's, appears in one of the audiences while the actors playing Ed & Lorraine Warren are lecturing to a group.",1384905600,,1319,4.771929824561403

When my daughter (8th grade) asked if she could have friends over to watch a scary movie, and they chose this one, I allowed it because it was reasonably clean.  They were REALLY scared by it, but, isn't that the point?  Thankfully, none of them seems to have been ""scarred"" by it.  I liken it to the 1980's film, Poltergeist -- seriously scary, nobody dies a gory death, and there's nothing in it a parent would blush about if watching it with a tween/teen.

I would have kept it more down to earth and used subtlety. I'm pretty sure that most of the experiences depicted in the movie did not happen quite so blatantly. Paranormal experiences are, after all, hallucinations that take place in the visual and auditory receptors in the brain (which is why it's almost 100% impossible to take a picture).

5405649,5,B00AAA62TI,"This, by far in my opinion is the most thrilling, fright filled paranormal film out right now.  The film has no sexual scenes,  very mild language, (No F word what so ever.)
It basically received the ""R"" rating for fright, being overly scary.
The goriest scene in the entire film would have to be the scene where they have to perform a exorcism on the mother.  They place a white sack over her head, where she spews blood on it leaving the viewer to wonder what in the world is happing to her features.
The only other gory scene would have to be where the mother bits or scraps cannot remember which, the face on the cop during the exorcism.
All in all, the cast was fantastic.  Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, playing the roles of the two paranormal investigators ""The Warrens"", and lastly Lili Taylor, playing the role of the mother.
The acting was decent, the film was actually based off the true case files of the Warrens.  So not only do you get the true story of what happen at the farm house and that family, you also get to see scenes of other paranormal investigations the Warrens have attended.  The very begin of the film shows another Warrens case films, being the story of the possessed doll name ""Annabel"".
The film is based off a true story.
All in all, the film was brilliant.  I have a copy, and highly recommend it for the person that likes paranormal stuff, and being scared, to add it to their collection or to at least watch it.

5405691,5,B00AAA62TI,"Perhaps one of the best horror movies of all time. I prefer my horror subtle, yet horrifying and this tale fits the bill. What cinches this movie for me is that it is based on a lesser known case investigated by the famed paranormal investigators the Warrens. The Warrens were famous for their investigation of the Amityville haunting, but their work is much broader and deeper than this case alone. Though as movies do the actual events are overplayed, you still get a sense of the disturbing nature of the haunting at Perron House.  Some might disagree with the approach of the Warrens who could be described as being more traditional demonologists with a strongly Catholic approach the value of their work in the paranormal is profound if somewhat sensationalized.

I've read reviews, not so much on Amazon but elsewhere, that this film contains religious propaganda. I don't want to write a spoiler here, so I won't say why, one way or the other.

5405718,2,B00AAA62TI,"The product being churned out by the film industry continues to degenerate. It's getting discouraging.<---Make that sentence past tense, come to think of it.

Yet another gazillion bucks (relatively speaking) are spent to assemble a team of capable actors, set designers and effects artists, etc. More millions are spent crafting a trailer that truly does intrigue viewers (not as easy a thing to do as many people might believe), a massive ad-campaign is launched and, finally, upon release, most of us who still possess the ability to think in linear terms discover that no one bothered to hire writers with the talent needed to craft an entire and compelling film narrative. SPOILERS AHEAD. Let's get to the film.

There's no reason this could not have been a gripping movie, given the money spent and the team of actors involved. A few original ideas and some deft plotting could have turned this up several notches. As it is, we have a textbook derivative ""story"" (supposedly ""based on true events"" -- which is the first reason to roll one's eyes, whenever Hollywood says that, these days) and a few clever ideas thrown randomly into the proceedings. A large family moves into a farmhouse and discovers it to be haunted. They are perplexed. Meanwhile, a couple of ghost-hunters ""with a past"" are drawn into the mix. One of the most STUPID atrocities committed right off the bat is that the Lady Ghost-Hunter (Huntress?) reveals to the audience the exact nature of the haunting in its entirety. A cackling old witch related to someone involved with the Salem witch scandals used to own the property and hung herself from a tree in the front yard after sacrificing her baby and has threatened to punish anyone who gets involved with her land thereafter. Well, thank you very much! Aside from that being a completely moronic back-story (see below), why tell the audience all of this before the movie gets hopping? Why not keep it a mystery to add an element of suspense for the viewer, and trust me, this film *needs* suspense. Why not make this backstory something the ghost-hunters must unravel during their ongoing investigation? Forget about that helpful hint from Plot Construction 101.

Everything that follows involves your garden-variety Things That Go Bump in the Night, Something Invisible Pulled My Leg, The Clocks Stop a Little After 3AM!, Let's Set Up Some Religious Icons Around the House, Little Amy's Got an Imaginary Playmate, and Who Knew There Was a Boarded-Up Cellar in This Place? drivel. All of these motifs have been used before and to much greater cinematic effect. The whole thing plays like a dreary mashup of Poltergeist + An American Haunting + Paranormal Activity + The Exorcist + The Amityville Horror + Name Your Rip-Off Scare-Flick. Overall, there's not a frightening thing about this movie's impact, though a couple of scary images and gags do work well (the imagery of the oncoming storm and the brief shape-shifting of the clothesline bedsheet, the spiral-mirrored music box, a creepy game of clap-tag). A worthwhile film is not made by a few clever sight-gags, however. The actors, from Lily Taylor to Vera Farmiga to Ron Livingston all do fine work. Even the kids are convincing and obviously talented. Patrick Wilson is about as wooden and silly as the Annabelle Doll that plays an unintentionally funny cameo role, but no matter how competent or incompetent the cast, they can't do much with a hackneyed storyline. On the plus-side, the sets are excellent --very 1971-era authentic-- and the cinematography is solid. Kudos to the crews responsible for those elements. The smartest character in this botched affair was the dog, who knew a stinker (and a haunted house) when she smelled one and had the good sense to croak in her third scene, albeit without much emotional resonance or exploration. How vapid.

This brings me back to the foolishness of this film's backstory and the precipitous revelation of that backstory (see above). Is the crazy old witch a ghost, or a demon, or what? In the very first scene of this flick, the Warrens explicitly counsel a bunch of nitwits that ghosts have no power to cause physical harm. Only demons ""which have never walked in human form"" can do that stuff. Well, this human witch apparently hung herself and stayed on in the house (or around the property) as a ghost. That is, until she possesses the mother ... which would make her a demon? But she was human. And if this witch-ghostie-demon has the power to summon storms and flocks of birds and levitate and teleport and make things fly through the air, why did she hang herself from a tree in her nightgown in the first place? What was she afraid of, with all that power? Gah! This plot has more holes than a bag of Swiss Cheese slices and there's no rescuing a film this ultimately stupid and obvious and gimmicky and incoherent and half-baked. Too bad for Lili Taylor and actors like Farmiga and Livingston; again, they all do their best but it's sad to see them in an expensive project unworthy of their talents. I would like my money back on this one, without doubt. Look to classic older films for your horror fix, viewers. Do you want to know what is the only scary thing about this mess?

The majority of people seem to have lost all ability to discern quality from crap. Think about THAT in the wee small hour of midnight and shiver.",1384041600,19,5377,4.808648648648648

""WE really know the right 'Pass Word' with God""  (wink wink).  They are passing this movie off as true.  Lemme tell you;  God is not someone you pull out of a box at the right time to kick the bad guys butt and put him away.  That's how the movie felt to me.

5405746,5,B00AAA62TI,"When I first saw the film Insidious by James Wan I was definitely impressed with the jump scares, but that's exactly what they were: Jump Scares. There was an emptiness to the family that can usually be turned into something dark and morose and contribute to the overall tone of the film. But the emptiness came from the lack of chemistry between the actors, the computer effects that robbed the atmosphere any real strength, and also some sub-par acting.

Insidious felt like a test run for something great, and then The Conjuring was unleashed in theaters and finally the elements that seemed half-baked in the first Insidious film clicked. The clever camera work, the exceptional acting (and CASTING!) truly shined when the chemistry between the characters bloomed into what many horror films have lacked: Characters worth caring about. Suddenly the jump scares transformed into constant dread as you wished and hoped for their safety. Begin based off of the practiced Demonologists The Warrens, the events in the film also have an extra level of weight that I found welcome.

The Warrens and The Perron Family

These two families are the cornerstone and the heart of this film, not the supernatural events, not the scares, nor the mythos. The central focus should be the characters for these films, at least in my opinion. Spending time with either family seemed like a treat, but when they come together to fight a menace neither have ever encountered it made the battle for their souls all the more poignant. The dynamic each person had with the supernatural and then their interactions with each other in response was the strongest I've seen since The Exorcist. Who was ignored by the spirits? Who was simply being tortured, and who were the spirits trying to hurt by proxy? And the big question in the film that was thankfully fully explored: How do they overcome this evil.

That's what I think I enjoyed most about this film. It's ability to create dread and genuine fear without sacrificing clarity. Your hand was not being held and thankfully exposition was kept to a minimum, but you were always aware of the danger and the state of its intensity. The perfect balance achieved in this film is its greatest triumph. I give this film a perfect score.",1383696000,2,2261,4.849740932642487
5405747,1,B00AAA62TI,"The same old; seen many times before. You would think that demons or spirits or whatever that can be a challenge to God could do better than:
(1.) Open and close doors; make things fall down especially things that are susceptible like poorly hung pictures and frying pans on hooks.
(2.) Make the same thumping sounds that old houses have always made especially contraction as they cool down at night.
(3.) Drag a person by the hair or make them float (levitate, whatever).
(4.) Make a few small bruises just on an extremity every few nights - come on demon you can do better!
(5.) Take advantage of the human brain's built-in capacity to make a problematic scene into a recognizable image such as a face, etc.
(6.) Birds flying into buildings - they must eaten too many fermented berries. Or, birds are the one creature on Earth that demons/spirits really don't like.
(7.) The dog's heightened sense of smell and hearing makes them the first creature to annoy demons/spirits. Demons are wussies.
(8.) The possessed always have to look like an alien and death team up to torture and contort the victim - again what a waste of immense power; demons/spirits you need a better agent.

There are two families that you'll follow during the story. First, a couple that I'll term ""Ghost Busters"" and a family of seven.

Made by the people who brought you the Paranormal Activity series, insidious, Insidious 2 and Sinister, The Conjuring stacks up well against these new horror classics as it appears they have really found a successful formula for making movies that are both downright creepy while having mass appeal at the box office. They have again struck horror gold here with that similar formula but with a solid performance from Vera Farmiga as half of the real life Ghost Hunters Lorraine and Ed Warren, with Patrick Wilson putting in another solid performance as the earnest husband. Lili Taylor gets to add to her impressive career with a nice performance as the afflicted mother of the real life Perron family with Ron Livingston effectively portraying her husband who feels powerless to protect his family from forces he cannot comprehend.

It has fabulous characters, a good story plot, it's told so well---with pitch-perfect acting and brilliant directing.  More creepy/scary than horror---so that was very nice!

The only thing is...there's a story in the story that could also be told.  The couple that comes in to help rid this family of their ghosts has a daughter who seems awfully lonely and vulnerable.  And even though there's a weak ""nod"" to mother/daughter affection with each having a locket with the picture of the other, the couple actually seem to enjoy the troubled family's children more than their daughter.  I kept expecting that to be a strong subplot.  Unfortunately this weaker aspect turns the locket idea into a kind of predictable device as a tool of the evil spirit.

This is not a movie to watch at night alone. If you do you'll be creeped out for sure. This is a fun group-movie to nervously laugh with everyone after the scenes where you all scream out loud together.

5405785,3,B00AAA62TI,"Old house.  Big family.  Old curse.  Weird stuff happens.  Poor dog.

The Conjuring is a ""haunted house"" film, loosely based upon a case of a couple of investigators in the... I want to say '60s or '70s, can't remember without looking.  Right off the bat, ignore hype.  If you have ANY experience with high profile horror films over recent years, you know they don't live up to the hype.  The Conjuring is not the ""scariest movie ever!"" or ""made me wet myself!"" or any of that hype babble, so just... ignore it.

That said, it is a decent run at a ""haunted house"" film.  They explained why the house is haunted enough for me to buy it.  Shock scares are there, but not done to death.  Actors were believable.  The house is just perfect for a haunted setup, a nice old house you would know has history.

My only real complaint, though not really big, are the build around the ""doll"" and then, they didn't follow through.  They could have made it a larger role in the film, especially towards the end, but they didn't take the opportunity.  Also, I think they jumped too quickly to concluding the dog's part in the film.  Animals are great ""ghost detector"" mechanics and I wish they would have utilized that accepted plot tool a bit more before removing it.

Worth a watch, maybe repeated viewing to catch all the ""corner of your eye"" moments.  Buy if you are into haunted house type films",1383523200,,1387,4.476

There were some scenes that were pretty horific and others that were pretty disturbing, but nothing that lived up to the hype. Altogether, it was a reasonably scary movie and one to watch if only to say you've seen it.

5405817,1,B00AAA62TI,"A family moves to an old, isolated farmhouse and soon regrets it. The mother seeks help from a famous pair of paranormal investigators; they soon regret it, too. I regretted watching it, for reasons I will discuss below; spoilers!

Spoilers here! You've been warned! I was so disappointed in this film and I was so surprised to be disappointed because I had seen the trailer and it looked so good and so scary. Well, that trailer was better than the film. Worse yet that scene in the trailer with the laundry blowing in the wind proved to be only a split second in length in the film. What a waste! And talk about unintentionally funny, wow. At one point in the film Mrs. Warren, who claims to be a medium, researches the history of the house and announces fearfully to her husband that it was built by a man who married a woman who had been accused of witchcraft at Salem. Oh noes! Because of course she must really have been a witch! Apparently it never occurred to Mrs. Warren that being a medium was hardly an acceptable line of work for a nice Catholic mom in the 70's and that a couple hundred years earlier she herself would have been accused of witchcraft. Burned at the stake too, most likely, and by her own church! It gets worse: Mr. Warren criticizes the beseiged father because--gasp!--his kids aren't baptized! Well, he conveniently doesn't ask if the parents were baptized--I'm betting they were--and it sure didn't help Mom, did it? The movie is full of moments like those. It is also full of every sort of derivative stuff from other movies and TV shows, so much so that you could play a game with it. Give yourself credit if you recognize: the Annabelle doll from Mysteries at the Museum. Being dragged by the foot, from Paranormal Activity. The dead child who insists on being noticed from The Changeling. The paranormal investigation team ala Ghost Hunters. The unbelieving investigator who ends up believing from Amityville Horror. The creepy closet that parallels the TV in Poltergeist. The flocks of crazed birds from The Birds. The girl dragged around the room by an unseen entity from An American Haunting. The possessed mother who bites an investigator in the neck from The Walking Dead. Yes, I commented drily to my sister that it appeared to me that she wasn't possessed, she was turning into a zombie and it was too bad they didn't have cameo appearances by Carl and Daryl from that show. They'd have known how to deal with Mom and they'd have put both her and the poor audience out of their misery. What a joke. As for the Warrens, I don't know whether to think that they were grifters who preyed on the fearful or people who had problems of their own. Was Mrs. Warren's being a ""medium"" merely an effort by her to work through some sort of trauma in her own life? Did their cases, which forced her to confront ""monsters"" over and over, come from something in her early life such as incest or molestation? Who knows but the film was a mess and I'd love to see what the little robots from Mystery Science 3000 would say about it. Update: Oh, and give yourself extra credit points if you connect the laundry scene with its earlier inspiration: the classic M. R. James story, Oh Whistle And I'll Come To You.",1383436800,34,3235,4.558419243986254

The ghosts were in our house before us so they just wanted some respect and we have come to an agreement and we now live in peace,we are lucky its all they wanted.

5405831,5,B00AAA62TI,"This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. They did use a lot of standard horror devices to make it scary and so parts of it were predictable. That is unavoidable with horror movies these days. The movie is not original, but it was very well done and the predictability did not get in the way with it being terrifying. Perhaps the most original part is combining a haunted house movie with a possession movie. If you like being scared, get this movie.

5405844,5,B00AAA62TI,"I loved the story, but you can tell where Hollywood added some stuff in for dramatic effect. However the true effect of this movie is the terror of reality. While it does have the traditional bangs etc the true terror comes from the fact it happened. Thus it can happen to you. The actual people said that Hollywood refused to put in the most terrifying events, and I really don't like that. One of the reasons is it would be too scary. I feel that in order to defeat evil you must know what you're fighting. Also the adding into the story for drama, especially at the end was a little disappointing to me. But it's all very well done. The film makes it clear that not only does God exist but so does the devil. Without forcing religion down the audiences throat. The acting is great, my only complaint is I wish it was longer. If ever I wanted a movie to be three hours this is it. The moral of this story is beware what you wish for. Since, like many people today, the stars of the film make a living looking for the paranormal. Problem is no one ever asks what if we find something, and what happens if it isn't Casper? I also loved the fact this movie presents a much needed breath of fresh air into the horror genera by making an intelligent, amazing story. It challenges man to rethink his beliefs. I believe in God, but you can't have one without the other. I'm not arrogant enough to think that in this vast universe we're all alone in this life or the next.",1383436800,2,1466,4.258064516129032

5405847,3,B00AAA62TI,"Good old-fashioned scares are both rampant and effective in this film. The effects, music and cinematography combined to make this a beautifully done film.

However, as far as the plot goes, the film contradicts itself. In the movie, the demonologists explain that this was a case of demonic possession, meaning, the entity possessing the house never walked the earth in human form. However, the last half of the movie reveals the fact that a dead witch is haunting the land that was once hers. After establishing the fact that this was a demonic possession, it proceeded to show a haunting by a ghost. (Also, other ghosts possessed the house, all of whom were victims of the witch's crazy antics.)

In summation, great scares, but confusing mixed messages. This only weakens the credibility of the statement ""based on true events"". (As if ghosts and demons did not discredit it enough!)",1383350400,,887,4.946308724832215

I like watching movies knowing that they have truly happened compared to Hollywood's typical formula! Out of all of the movies I have seen having to do with this nature, this one is by far the most impressive and scary! It starts out slowly with basics like noises and then builds up to terror throughout the rest of movie to the end! It was really cool that they showed photos of the actual families involved in this story which made it all the more exciting to me!

The film is based off the experiences of real life paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. This is the type of movie that will make you start ""google-ing"" to the far reaches of the internet to find out about exorcisms, hauntings and demonic presences.  The true life aspects of the movie mixed with the good pacing and effective uses of suspense and old school horror tricks really make it worth watching.  It had us jumping up from the couch a couple of times.

While the overall arc of The Conjuring follows the same path as pretty much every other ""haunted/possessed"" film, there was definitely something about the way the story moved along that held my attention and made for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  I was extremely tense and on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.  I had both dread and eager anticipation for what was going to happen next.  I haven't been able to quite put my finger on what it was about this film that entertained me so well, but it did and I highly recommend this film.",1383264000,,655,4.4789915966386555

5405901,3,B00AAA62TI,"One of the first things I heard about when moving to Connecticut was Ed and Lorraine Warren. Last night (night before Halloween) Ms. Warren gave a lecture to a sold-out crowd at SCSU. Not only The Conjuring, but many other movies have been created based off of their work, such as The Haunted and The Haunting in Connecticut. They are also featured in the book THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, which has been the basis of ten films.

As for The Conjuring, it begins with the story of Annabelle, the possessed doll (Google ""the Warrens Annabelle"" for a creepy tale). I wish the movie ventured more into this tale, but they had to move on to the haunting that took place in Rhode Island.

Once viewers are brought to Rhode Island, everything moves at a nice slow-burned pace. Any creepy moments are signified by the shaking of the camera. Admittedly, this would be a lame technique if used throughout, but it's not. About halfway through the movie, things ramp-up to full scare mode. Things fly off of walls, shadows move out of the corners, doors slam, and the monster shows itself.

Everything worked together nicely until about the end. Movies based in reality are particularly scary to me, but when the ""this is somewhat believable"" moment is broken, the movie lost its effect. I don't want to reveal end-of-movie spoilers, but I think it's safe to say what happens to the person needing exorcised was a bit over-the-top.

Overall the movie was very well done and the acting crew did a phenomenal job. I can't say it's the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it was enough to leave me with the creepy jitters for the rest of the night.",1383177600,14,1626,4.635416666666667

5405907,4,B00AAA62TI,"Directed by James Wan (Saw Insidious), The Conjuring follows the story of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). Some people may remember their names for their involvement with the Amityville haunting in Long Island, which became the basis of a 1979 film The Amityville Horror.

James Wans latest film is a clever re-working of the 1970s-style old-fashioned horror genre. The Conjuring is about an actual case of the Perron family  husband and wife Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor), who moved into a dilapidated farmhouse in Rhode Island with their five daughters. Believing their house is haunted, they ask the Warrens to investigate.

The storyline itself is simple, even familiar. With the atmospheric photography and production design, however, the film manages to be very creepy. What makes the film really work is that scares are delivered in a subtle way, especially in the first half of the film. I never thought handclapping could be this scary.

And perhaps most importantly, thanks to the strong acting from the cast we really care about the characters, even when the skeptics in us refuse to believe their story. But what matters here is the story, and that is very scary.",1383091200,,1263,5.116504854368932

5405911,2,B00AAA62TI,"Every move made by the characters and every scare tactic utilized was predictable. So much so that it lost all its creepy vibe.

5405923,1,B00AAA62TI,"this is kinda cool because I actually live just behind this house (the real house in harrisville, ri) on the powerline grid-
my neighbors who own the farm just behind them knew Roger and Carolyn personally- and their little girls. Roger was a salesman and always away from home, carolyn was home with the children- and she was not mentally stable from what I'm told by a couple of neighbors who have lived here the past 50 years. Roger liked his booze- and his wife a dramatic person- the whole family was unstable. I've actually met the contractor who renovated the house and personally know the family who owned all the land next to the perrons land (which is now mostly owned by Rosenfeld concrete- and I bought my land off of tom Schwartz- who owns all the forest on our block (up to the perrons property) and who's ex-wife Pam used to live in the perron house just after they left. Schwartz bought the property off of the Perron family-

The movie is 100% pure BS and not based on a single piece of documented evidence-at all! The Perron's are simply tale tellers and the warrens simply live for the fame and never accommodate skeptics. There's so many holes and inconsistancies in every single one of the warren's ""cases""- I've read them all. This entire movie is based on nothing but rumor and second hand story tales. There hasn't been a single reported incident in this house since Schwartz bought it and since resold it (hmmmm,wonder why?) This movie is actually pissing all of the neighbors off because of all the people who come and take photos and actually knock on everyone's door to get info about the house- even had the burrillville PD keep people away because it's out of control.

It's amazing how eager people are to believe and accept any premise that hint's to an afterlife.

that being said- it is somewhat of a scary movie; but unlike real terror movies like the exorcist, the conjuring gets you with the typical new-age horror movie scare tactics with use of loud noises in dark rooms - I enjoyed watching it but there were some pretty big holes in the story, for example- why would a man move his 7 member family into a new-england house in the fall without knowing if the furnace was working? According to the movie- the furnace was located in the ""secrete room"" that was accidentally found when the girls were playing ""clap & seek"" in the closet; roger went down into the secrete basement where there was a piano and old furniture, and then found the furnace in the same room, and then told his wife he'd be up in a few minutes, he wanted to try to get the furnace working....??? which means he moved his family into a new-england house just before winter and never thought to ask the sellers where the furnace was- since it was in the ""secrete basement?"" pretty stupid lapse of logic in the story. Too bad I can't post pics- because I have a few of me riding my bike over that bridge you see in the special features section of the dvd ""face to face with terror"" that bridge is less then 1000' from my house just through the woods.

watch the movie- just take Hollywood's version (and perron's tales) with a huge, HUGE grain of salt and don't believe everything you see on the big screen- even the ""based on true events"" which is all total bulls[...].

I drive past the house every day on the way to / from work- it's a nice house since it was renovated- plenty of new cars in the driveway- certainly doesn't look like anyone is being tortured by demons or ghosts in that house...",1383091200,185,3508,4.492163009404389
5405924,4,B00AAA62TI,"I'm a big fan of this genre, so I was excited to see this movie.  It's very refreshing to see a movie of this sort shot in the traditional sense.  Since Paranormal Activity practically every movie in the genre had been of the ""found footage"" style and most are crap.  I'm also a big fan of how this movie doesn't have a lot of the ""cheap scares"" where something just pops out of nowhere rarely with any sort of payoff.  Most of the acting is done well, and the film builds to nice climax.  I gave the movie only four stars because it doesn't break any new ground, but what it does, it does well.

It was a great movie, creepy, one that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up from time to time, and it made me want to never hear a clapping sound again!

I would give it 5 stars for the acting, the story and effects.  I especially loved seeing the real life Lorraine in the midst of a scene at the college.  :D",1383091200,,558,4.0

I purchased the movie for $14.00. Ordered some Pizza with my girlfriend and sit back for what I  knew was going to be an awesome scary night.

Supposedly, according to reviews... ""you won't be able to sleep!"" Really???  It was all I could do to stay awake!

Paranormal activity went over the line about episode 3. The conjuring couldn't even get out of the box.

5405965,4,B00AAA62TI,"I rented this one at the recommendation of a friend during my ""Halloween movie-fest"" tradition. Let's face it: haunted houses have been done to death (bah-dum-CHING), so it would have to take a recommendation for me to view it. The story, as most in this genre do, introduces the family to their new home and lets them get moved in before anything happens. The first thing I liked about this one was that things started to happen pretty quickly, after their first night there actually. At the same time that we are getting to know the family, we are also introduced to the Warrens...a couple who are somewhat famous paranormal investigators. That added another level of interest to the story-line. Without wanting to give too much away, there were several occurrences that had me jumping, and several times that I wanted to fast-forward a little (I call this my litmus test...if I get nervous about what might happen and want to speed it up so I don't get too scared). I did have some of my usual thoughts during horror movies (the way the walls always look dirty in these movies and why wouldn't someone paint them before moving in; I would totally not stay in a house that my animal didn't want to go into; after you know something scary is going on, why would you go take a nap by yourself in another room far, far away). But nothing kept me from getting into the movie, getting scared, and enjoying it. The movie moved along at a nice pace and I would definitely recommend it.",1383004800,2,1480,4.546816479400749

5405967,1,B00AAA62TI,"""The Conjuring"" COULD have been a great B movie -- as it is, the movie deserves a grade of F.
Yeah, it pushes ALL the right buttons -- and does it well! -- and as such, it is the perfect scary movie for empty-minded viewers.

 But great horror movies -- even the B-grade ones -- and their writers and directors, knew/know that horror, like science fiction, is about something else.  It's a comment on society as well.

""The Body Snatchers"" was the perfect comment on McCarthyism, and when resurrected, on the Reagan and G.W. Bush eras that pushed the ""with us or against us"" school of thought.  Same for ""The Thing From Another World"" and its remake, Carpenter's ""The Thing"". ""The Exorcist"", while dated now, did similar things; and so did the original ""Carrie"" (B-grade or not).

But the WORST part about ""The Conjuring"" as a horror movie is the ""based on true events"" angle, especially since it's obviously based, at least partly, on the now-debunked ""Amityville Horror"" b.s. and that Ed and Lorraine Warren claimed/claim all of that was ""real"".  Worse, it uses -- literally -- the memory of those who were persecuted and murdered during the Salem Witch trials, basically reinforcing the neo-Christian Conservative mindset so prevalent these days. Like we need more of that ignorance in America.  Yeeeech.",1383004800,9,1307,4.882352941176471

That was what made Insidious fun - getting the visual references to so many old horror movies. The Conjuring is merely tiresome, even if it is ""based"" on a true story. We've seen it before and done better. If the screenwriters and director had gone for more originality, less ""over-the-top"" theatrics and more subtle menace, it might have become a true classic of horror. Speaking of the script - it starts out well enough but my the third act it becomes overly active including an unnecessary detour to a Warren family crisis which didn't add anything to the story. The few short scenes didn't detract from the momentum, but they only added confusion to an already hyperactive script when the film should have raced straight toward the conclusion. The cast is good, particularly John Brotherton as Office Brad - watch his body language as a typical early 70s macho stud becoming unnerved by a creaking rocking chair. All in all, not great and not bad. You might want to rent or otherwise view before you buy - or wait six months till it retails for 8 bucks.

5405994,4,B00AAA62TI,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this 2013 movie...

The Conjuring (2013) is a ghost story/demonic possession horror movie that is fairly effective at producing some scares.  Although I kept saying to myself, ""I've seen this sort of thing before"", it was a bit better than most of the trashy horror movies that have come out in the past 15-20 years.  It was good to see Lili Taylor in this movie.  I remember her from the remake of The Haunting (1999).  That was a terrible movie (I gave it 1 star), but Lili Taylor did a decent job in that movie and her performance in The Conjuring is no exception.  The Conjuring has a pretty good scary atmosphere and some creepy looking props (I don't want to give anything away).

If you want to see a decent horror flick that came out in 2013, then I pretty much recommend The Conjuring.  At least it isn't a remake of something (as far as I know).",1382918400,4,935,4.3895348837209305

5405996,5,B00AAA62TI,"In my opinion, what makes a truly scary movie is when you know it's based on fact.  I'm not one for a movie that's all blood and gore and leaves nothing to the imagination...this one leaves plenty to the imagination!  This was beautifully directed with just the right amount of eerie silence during which you would find yourself holding your breath waiting for the next scare. The creaking doors, the intense pounding sounds, the tugs and bruising on the family members all caused by mostly unseen objects added to the escalating suspense and set the mood for the frightening climax.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good scare.

BTW, Lorraine Warren appears as herself 44 minutes into the film.  She is the gray haired lady with the black jacket and the white blouse sitting upfront during the lecture.",1382918400,,843,4.786206896551724

That probably added to the spookiness of the film, obviously! I did, however, get pulled in, and did feel the story was done well.

After watching this, my toddler was up in her room crying (just having normal, toddler sleep probs). When I walked in the room, it was pitch dark, her nightlight had turned out, and I thought she was in her bed. As I approached the bed, she was actually in the middle of the room and touched my leg. OH MY GOSH I jumped so far and screamed. Poor thing, scared her too! Then she gets in bed and decides to kick the bed in a very rhythmic kick-kick-kick. It was reminiscent of the closet in the film.

None of this was paranormal and/or hauntings, just my wee mind playing tricks on me after watching this in a dark basement. Really did get me going to the spook side!!",1382918400,,965,4.26775956284153

Other reviewers have already explained the story line adequately, so I'll just tell you that it is a decent effort at spooking an audience and not grossing you out with torture and gore.

This Mr. Warren fellow was a regular guy who happened to luck up and marry a girl whom he had been deeply in love with, a woman who was WAY out of his league physically...she also happened to be bat-s*** crazy.  So he does what any man would do in his situation, to please the crazy and keep the gravy train going in the bedroom, he went along with, and fed into her feminine delusions.

She claims that she's ""SEEING"" ghosts and spirits and she's talking to dead people, and he, like a goof in love is just tagging along, enabling her obvious mental illness, even going as far as to become a self-proclaimed demonologist (WTF!!!).

Why does it seem that when it comes to crazy stuff like this...believing in ghosts and spirits and demons and astrology and psychics, that females seem to always be in the center of it.  It's the most annoying thing in the world to me to hear a female talk this nonsensical, juvenile, psycho babble...maybe it's their period medicine, I don't know, but I know that it's extremely annoying...please ladies keep your psychotic delusions to yourselves.

So there I was Saturday night, dimmed lights, big screen TV,  popcorn and soda by my side.  I even silenced my phone to give it that authentic movie theatre experience. Ready, set, action. The movie opens strong with Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators lecturing at a college.  We're introduced to a video of a former case involving a doll that was  truly freaky.

We like the Warrens, they're open, seemingly legit and not without humor.  Next we are introduced by way of an early 70's song, Time of the Season, a Zombies classic as we watch this nice family with 5 daughters of assorted ages move into an isolated, large old house.  Sadie, the dog refuses to enter which should be a clue that something's not right.  It doesn't take long before action occurs, the usual things that go bump in the night.  Did I see that?  Did I feel that?  Was it just my imagination?  Of course, it doesn't take long for the entire family to come to the conclusion that there's something up.  Enough people have commented about the plot so I won't bore you with my further plot synopsis.  Let me just say, this is no classic.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining enough but there was nothing particularly original here.  Maybe if I didn't see so many rave reviews from fans and critics, my expectations wouldn't have been so high.  To compare this to The Exorcist or state The Conjuring is this decade's best horror film is just misleading.  In my opinion, this is just average.

ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER.

i had no idea about the amityville horror angle....but i quickly got it at the beginning of this movie. this movie rips off every. single. horror. movie. ever. made.

Omen, Amityville, The Ring, ALL OF THEM. and blatantly so. really awful movie that could of been outstanding.

two stars for the house itsself, and lily taylor's country, urban chic haircut. (very difficult to pull off, but she did so)

the same people that 'investigated' amityville horror are the same re-re's who want you to buy this load.
i would buy it, however, if it wasn't so bad. cut it off early. i never do that.

5406065,5,B00AAA62TI,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge horror movie fan, and I'm hard to please when it comes to a good horror film.  ""The Conjuring"" is based on the case files of husband and wife ghost hunters, Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson).  When Carolyn and Roger Perron, along with their five children, move into their new home strange things begin to happen...The youngest daughter starts seeing an imaginary friend, another daughter begins sleep walking and banging her face into a wall, mom wakes up every morning with bruises appearing all over her body, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07 am, and then the really bad things begin to happen.  Enter Lorraine and Ed Warren to evaluate the house to see what is going on.  After a brief tour of the house, Lorraine has visions of death and quickly realizes the evil in this house is trying to attach itself to the family members.  Without going further into the plot, I'll say that the terror in the house escalates fast, leading to a truly scary, and satisfying conclusion.  James Wan, director of ""Saw"", has done a fantastic job of creating a scary and creepy horror movie with enough jolts, jumps, and gore to keep genre fans happy.  With all the garbage remakes, torture horror, or ridiculous PG-13 rated horror movies that have flooded the theaters over the years it's good to see a true scary movie come along.  Fans of classic 70's and 80's horror films will definitely enjoy this.  Highly Recommended!",1382745600,,1482,4.647509578544061

First off the ""investigators"" are a couple of frauds who- when I knew of them in Massachusetts, back in the mid to later 80's- were traveling in company of a defrocked priest who charged exorbitant sums to rid people of demonically possessed homes. Fact is, every single case they investigated was deemed ""demonic."" Sad thing was they even got some media attention. I operated a non-profit investigative agency (just myself, a couple of other like minded fellows and long before the high tech investigators of today)and ran afoul of their fee rates on a few occasions where some folks were genuinely scared of goings on and these ""investigators"" just happened to get to the client first. It doesn't surprise me that the misfortunes of those in real need should be perverted into sensationalism. In summation, throughout all my years of investigating I never came across one authentic case of demonic possession or even a serious enough haunting that couldn't be resolved with a bit of research and understanding. These people are frauds and certainly don't deserve the publicity this film will bring to them. Are they the next reality show? I sincerely hope not.",1382745600,24,1279,4.953488372093023

5406080,5,B00AAA62TI,"when I initially heard of this film and primarily its association with Ed and Lorraine Warren, I had a lot of major expectations. Since I had seen them appear as guests on the Don Lane show in the late 70s, on Australian TV, they made a very strong impression; they spoke of their work more in the sense of a vocation and it was very evident that their strong and positive characters/personalities came through right to the forefront. On the show I saw them on, they played some audio tapes which may have come from the UK or may have been from the US, I don't recall, anyway these tapes were spooky, chilling, and if they ever sold them or provided them as an extra on a new version of this film of some of the documentaries about them, I would buy them at the drop of a hat. The essential point I'm trying to convey is that the character of Ed and Lorraine Go to the heart of the story in the conjuring, and I think you cannot divorce Ed and Lorraine as central and credible real-life characters without changing the story.
 Right from the start of the film the quality of tension underlies the entire film. James Wan makes the light and shade, as well as a couple of jokes, work immensely well for this film. Although I understand that this was scripted, it was supposed to be scripted from real-life, but thanks to the fact that there is no commentary of any kind, we simply don't know. I think it would be appropriate for the filmmakers to either get Lorraine Warren (if she wants to) do a commentary, or maybe have the writers do a joint commentary saying what is adapted real-life, and what is out and out fiction. Overall, at least from my point of view, I would classify this film as the scariest I've ever seen. I have been shut down about this, and told that MAMA, INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, and some other films are scarier, but given what I know about Ed and Lorraine, and that I like supernatural, ghost house type stories (however, this is so much more than just a ghost house story), I still maintain that this is a James Wan masterpiece that takes you on a tour of the dark side.
 When I received the DVD Blu-ray combo was happy to find that the cover was the hologram of one particular scene, and it's pretty cool. I still don't like the ultraviolet option since you have to sign up for two accounts (and they ask you for too much personal material), the file you can stream is only available for a limited time, and the so-called digital download presupposes you've passed over all the personal information before you can get the digital file. Anyway, I really wish the Studios would just can it with the UV garbage and provide a digital download. The Three extras are really great, since you get an interview with the original family, as well as the clearly terrified mother; there is also a special on Lorraine Warren, who takes her work very seriously, and the special feature is a very powerful bonus. The feature with James Wan, is a pleasure to watch, since he is obviously done his research on Ed and Lorraine, and it is clear James enjoys his work, and he knows what scares you...; Which makes his later claim, which he gave in a separate interview that I saw on the BBC, that he is leaving horror all the more devastating: there is simply no one of the caliber of James Wan that I am aware of. I for one, certainly hope he goes back on his statement that he is leaving horror, since I'll be lining up for tickets at the theater, and preorders for combo packs.

Amazon's Fulfillment services in Lexington KY is getting to be very bothersome; I had two orders thrown together in one BAG, and it looked like no care was taken with the orders at all.

Horror films have recently been relying on jump-out scares or scenes of torture to convince the viewer that what's happening is frightening.  These tales force superficial fear on the viewer because the storytelling doesn't get the job done.  The biggest drawback to films such as these is that the eerie feeling doesn't linger.  Once you exit the theater, the movie falls off you, forgotten without trouble.

""The Conjuring"" resurrects the genre of ambient horror, though.  It trades in cheap thrills for something more substantive that sticks to you like cobwebs you can't shake off.  Vera Farmiga is - as always - captivating.  To be fair, the rest of the ensemble does remarkable work here.  Acting, dialogue, and story stop just short of flawless.  The ""based on a true story"" element isn't even needed to propel the eerie mood but certainly doesn't hurt either.",1382659200,4,890,5.075862068965518
5406082,5,B00AAA62TI,"I was terrified to watch this movie when my wife first kept going on an on about it just from the previews! We got it as soon as the store put it out. We watched it and were jumping left and right. We were both scared out of our minds! I held onto her and she held onto me! No there was no cussing in it or gore, but there didn't need to be. THIS WAS A TRUE STORY!!! It was horrifying just to know it could and did happen. I've experienced paranormal activity before, but nothing to this degree and it was bone chilling!!! I'm glad that the family survived and that Ed and Lorraine were able to help the family, but the story was just seriously disturbing! Excellent movie that scared me half to death!",1382659200,5,702,4.131386861313868
5406083,5,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring along with Insidious represent two of the best horror films made in a very long time. Director James Wan truly is a master at the genre. Insidious revived the genre of horror that had become stale and predictable over the last 20 years. With the arrival of Insidious audiences had a reason to be scared for the first time in many years. It's something of a horror classic. In fact it might well be one of the best horror films ever made. It's filled with fresh new ideas, fantastic production values, great unpredictable moments, and some truly scary sequences. The Conjuring may very well be an even better horror movie. Wan manages to fill the film with many memorable and scary moments, while making it completely different in form and style from Insidious. As I watched it I kept asking myself ""Might this be a new modern day horror masterpiece?"" Well not quite, but it comes very close. There are few moments in the film that let's the audience off the hook, it's filled with plenty of genuine scares, and lots of good old fashioned horror.

How many horror movies has there been made that are better than The Conjuring? That is an important question. In my opinion maybe about 10 or 15. Maybe a few more. I've seen everything under the sun, from the most taboo gore films to the most atmospheric of the genre. Despite that this movie made me truly feel horrified several times. It also managed to creep me out big time. The film has some weaker moments, but even those are done to perfection, such as an exorcism sequence near the end. James Wan is clearly a director who knows how to scare the crap out of audiences, or at least jaded horror fanatics like me. Up till near the end I was convinced James Wan's new film is a new modern horror masterpiece. I'm still trying to  decide if that is fitting or not. One thing is for sure, this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in quite some time.

I'm eager to see what Mr. Wan does next. Of Wan's work I've only seen Insidious and this one, and both are truly excellent horror movies, done with style, and class. I'm in awe of Wan and the magic he's managed to create within both of these films. Not since The Exorcist and a few other classics like it have I been genuinely horrified by and felt like I've had the bejesus scared out of me like both these Wan films have managed to do. James Wan is exactly what the title of this review indicates. The new master of horror, and The Conjuring is truly a very well made and genuinely scary experience to sit through.",1382659200,5,2540,4.411513859275053

5406085,1,B00AAA62TI,"I love supernatural horror stories and really hoped this one would live up to it's hype.  And, while I did get goosebumps a time or two and responded to most of the predictable jump out of your seat frights and while there was a subtle eerieness through some of the film, as many other reviewers have commented, the film was very cliched and was really more a compilation of scenes and story lines from countless other films.

And, the appearance of the witch and ghosts was pretty lame - blackened eyes and cracking white makeup.  The Grudge did exponentially better with plain old white and black makeup.  The creaking doors, tossed balls and banging were considerably scarier than the poorly made up ghosts and witch.  Unlike many other films today which overuse CGI, I wish the creators of this film had incorporated even a little CGI to enhance the spooky, but all of their special effects and makeup looked like first year quality film student work.  And what was up with the seeming foot fetishes of the ghosts - couldn't the writers have had the ghosts do more than play footsie and pull hair?

Aside from those awkward points, the overbearing and nearly non-stop pushy religious assertions of the Warren characters ruined this film for me.  I understand the real Warrens and the brothers who wrote the movie are all basically jesus freak types, but whether any of them really believed it or not, the seemingly constant rambling about missions from god and exortations to baptise the children, and submit to god and all that type of BS, as well as the hokey insertion of crosses all over the place was forced and ultimately hollow.  In fact, rather than add to the chill and thrill of the story, the religious propaganda did nothing more than disrupt my viewing of the film.  This cheesy incorporation of clobbering religious aspects was in stark contrast to The Exorcist where the appeal to religion felt organic and ultimately imperative on behalf of the characters and so was completely natural and essential to the plot.

Another weak element was that overall, the acting was pretty sketchy, for instance, I really like Ron Livingston, but in this film, he seemed more like a set piece - a wooden mannequin - than a contributing lead - I don't think his facial expression changed once throughout.  And, while young Joey King was exceptional at conveying terror in her scene with the unseen entity lurking in the dark corner behind the bedroom door, sadly, Lilli Taylor conveyed more a sense of over the top soap opera melo-drama than terror in many of her scenes and that bagged headed exorcism scene was a total joke.  Vera Farmiga just seemed glassy eyed and dreary, except for the very brief scene where the possessed Canadian grabbed her arm eliciting a fairly realistic sense of horror from her character.  And sadly, Patrick Wilson just came across as another religion bully with his character.

Finally, as many others have pointed out, the ending was way too corny - jeebus saves the day - yay!  Seriously???  I give this movie 1 star meaning 'hated it' because of the poor dialogue, weak plot, slow pacing, poor effects, poor acting and overbearing religious propaganda.",1382659200,2,3191,4.804387568555759

Period props, sets, period wardrobe, and make-up are amazing. The special effects are (spot on) with top quality CGI.  This is the perfect ghost/exorcist movie ever, without saying too much. This movie actually makes the original (Exorcist) look like child's play. The title of the movie is also misleading, they should have named it (The Haunted House), that's basically what the movie is about...nothing is really (Conjured up). Thank me later.

This would be up there (and I believe it will be)with  The Innocents, The Haunting, The Changeling, and The Exorcist.  It has perfect pacing, atmosphere, acting, style, and scares.

Seemed more like a bad fiction B-rated horror flick, and about as annoying as those ghost hunter cable TV shows - a lot of nothing portrayed with dark rooms or flashing lights. I thought the best part was the late 60s or early 70s hairstyles, a flash of good music and good old cars.
I'm not sure I believe in all of the Warren's hokum, but I always enjoy ghosts, hauntings etc.
This movie starts off bad with the family dog dying and gets worse from there. There are many disjointed scenes between the Warren family and the family at the farm. I had to keep thinking, who is this now??? My husband fell asleep 10 minutes into the film. I tried very hard to keep involved in the story without missing something important and it was difficult. I just kept waiting for something really good to happen. If the exorcism could be called the ""something good"", well it came. It was tense because of the over the top loud screams of the possessed. It was so loud my dogs moved to another room and I wanted to turn the sound down.
Just so disappointing is all I can say. One more thing to add about this DVD. Why in the world when you buy a DVD must you (the buyer) be bombarded with 5 or more movie trailers?? Really media is just too out of hand.",1382486400,3,1560,4.151815181518152
5406112,4,B00AAA62TI,"James wan did a good job in making the film,  However, I did like his recent film insidious better.  The plot started out great with a few simple doors opening , apparitions here and there and noise. So the family hires a married couple who are ghost hunters too see and inspect the house.  I would say I did like how wan portrayed the apparitions via pictures and the sound affects.  I think  the possessions were to animated . It was difficult too visualize the mother running around the house as a zombie and being possessed.

 Overall its a very good movie but compared to other ghost movies, I would rate this in my top 10 but not top 5...  The only reason I would give it a 4 star rather than a 5 is because of the possession and some parts of the film..  for example, the ghost hunter falls into this hole behind the closet and onto the basement and doesn't even gets hurt... and of course the possession could of been more subtle.

real hauntings like in documentaries don't have ghosts climbing walls and someone turning into a zombie such as Hollywood portrays.. Its more subtle and in a way where you do see images and noise and on occasion you will get intimated by its presence .  A good example is the movie ""the innkeepers""  you don't really see or hear  the ghost until the end of the film  and at some points during the middle of the film  GREAT ENDING!  BY THE WAY

1) the exorcist original version

I try to watch them but I end up turning them off and find them silly/poorly done/bad story/bad acting/etc. Very few scary movies seem capable of holding my attention now days. The reviews for this movie gave me the impression it might be better.

Basic premise: The family moves into a house that has an evil spirit and starts terrorizing them. They ask two known paranormal experts to help them rid their family of the entity.

This basic premise has been done over and over again. Did this movie do a good job? Yes they did.

This movie is not overdone, underdone, it is just right in so many ways. The acting, the CGI and the writing are all well done. This movie kept my attention from beginning to end. In fact, it left me wanting to see more. A rarity these days. I would like for the same makers to make a movie about the doll.

Family friendly: Only scary parts. No nudity, sex nor offensive language.

If you are looking for blood and guts or tons of gore this is not your movie. The movie is not super scary. This is pretty good story telling with better than average acting and the special effects were perfect for the movie. It is like the people that made the movie really wanted to make a quality scary movie. It probably won't win any awards but compared to the competition, it is by far the best scary movie I have seen in a long time.

4 stars for a movie is a very good rating from me. Friends/family know I watch a lot of movies and often ask me for recommendations.

ETA: I have seen several reviewers mention/compare the movie ""Insidious."" I decided to give it a watch tonight. First, I did not realize I had seen ""Insidious"" before until I got to the bed scene. I thought some stuff looked familiar. I rented this movie some time back and turned it off before it ended. I did the same tonight. ""Insidious"" is not even in the same league as ""The Conjuring."" They both have one of the same lead actors but that is it.""",1382486400,10,2094,4.286075949367088

The cast of throwaway characters in this epic fail basically include Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as Carolyn and Roger Perron and their brood of kids and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson playing Lorraine and Ed Warren; Plus various other non essential players.

The tired old premise being that the Perron family move into an old spooky farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere...set up housekeeping and start to hear `noises`. So the Paranormal couple is brought in to banish the evil entity who resides there.

The Conjuring uses every clich in the book in an attempt to scare us but none of it ever really materializes. The players seem to be struggling to appear scared to death at every shadowy corner and try desperately to `react` to all those thumps and bumps in the night...

The viewer gets no real sense of who these people are nor do we care.

But that's totally beside the point.  The main thing is it's not that scary.  It's probably just as scary as the recent-ish remakes of 13 GHOSTS and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.  Not that scary, IMO, although I did enjoy the action and macabre of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL back when I was 16 (haven't re-watched it recently, I don't remember it well enough to know what I'd think of it if I saw it again).  They try to incorporate drama-esque elements in the storytelling, bits of character development and the actors do give it their all, which gives the film a more down to earth and believable feel, but the story was too thin and what little story there was didn't get the attention it deserves.  The focus of the film was the supernatural build-up that made it obvious to the household that the place was haunted.  The paranormal investigating itself takes less than half the film, and prior to then it just seems like 1979's THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in HD.

5406123,4,B00AAA62TI,"Like other films that James Wan has directed ""The Conjuring"" generates thrills and chills mixing old fashioned horror film making without relying on extensive visual effects.

SPOILERS:

Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deal with nasty hauntings. Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) live in such a house where manvelant spirits are threatening their family. Unfortunately the spirits have latched on to the family so no matter where they go, it'll follow them. Carolyn reaches out to Ed and Lorraine hoping that they can help drive the creatures from their home.

A nice blend of the new and old ""The Conjuring"" touches on everything from ""The Amnityville Horror"" to ""The Exorcist"" with a touch of ""The Birds"" thrown in for good measure. Wan skillful merges these different elements and, with terrific performances from his cast, creates a refreshingly old fasioned scare fest that is a nice change of pace from the ""found footage"" flicks.

I did feel that the film lost some of its momentum by the conclusion but, otherwise, it was a fun ride.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray edition looks marvelous. This is the type of film that has long sequences in darkness. The blu-ray transfer has nice detail and the subdued color scheme is largely faithful to the theatrical showing of the film.

The audio is immersive putting us into the house with the family.

The special features seem a bit on the lite side to me but what we do get is pretty good. ""The Conjuring: Face To Face With Terror"" allows the family (and Lorraine Warren, Ed is deceased) portrayed in the film to share their experience.

We also get a featurette ""A Life In Demonology"" focusing on the cases that the Warrens worked on. We also get a glimpse inside the New England Paranormal Museum. Other paranormal investigators also chime in with information about Ed and Lorraine Warren.

The final special feature is an eight minute featurette entitled ""Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You"". Producer Peter Sanfran, Veriga and Wan discuss the making of the film and what brought them to the project.

The packaging also includes a DVD (with all the special features) and a code for a digital download.

A entertaining horror movie with plenty of thrills, ""The Conjuring"" reminds us that you don't need buckets of blood, sex or outrageous violence to scare your audience. As someone points out in the ""Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You"" Wan wanted to avoid ""cheap scares"" and use his skills as a film director (the writers point out that the original script had MORE scares but Wan elected to pull some of them out so that he could build suspense)to pull the audience in before pulling the rug out from under them.",1382400000,,2709,4.814655172413793

5406127,4,B00AAA62TI,"Modern horror films just aren't that scary anymore.  They rely on jump scares, gore, and horny teenagers.  Sure, this started quite a while back; but the films coming out today take themselves way too seriously to even have that ""camp"" factor that makes them so enjoyable.  Make no mistake: there is no camp about THE CONJURING.  There is also almost no gore, surprisingly few jump scares, and nary a bikini-clad coed to be seen.  Instead, we have those bits 'n pieces that make a truly great horror film: tension, suspense, and something actually at stake.

The plot revolves around the Parron family, who move into a secluded country house that, unbeknownst to them, has a sordid, violent history.  Things start happening that very first night, and slowly escalate so badly that wife Carolyn invites the Warrens to investigate.  Ed and Lorraine Warren are the seventies' version of ghost hunters, who've seen and documented demonic possession.  They immediately recognize the evil in the Parron household...and are also forced to admit that their presence may be too little, too late.

Ultimately, THE CONJURING boils down to a possession film, and as such does fall short of the ""greatness"" mark; the only truly great possession film I can think of is THE EXORCIST (although I'll admit, I tend to dislike most possession premises).  CONJURING's conclusion, too, embodies the low-blow theatrics that the rest of the film shirks.  So that's a bit of a shame, that it doesn't end on a strong note.  But getting there...oh boy.  The film truly revolves around atmosphere, using shadows, sound effects, and solid acting to slowly ramp up the tension.  The four adult leads (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, and especially Lili Taylor) are fantastic, though it's the child actors who truly shine (perhaps because it's so hard to find good child acting in horror films; that's one improvement modern horror films have, but it's a very small edge).  The script is solid for the most part, and the direction/camerawork are effective.  James Wan has delivered a solid, truly unsettling horror film.  He may have started the SAW franchise (though the first one, the only one which Wan directed, is actually a darn good movie), but he's been spending his time making up for all the lackluster sequels that film has inspired.  THE CONJURING is a film that can please on almost all levels: people who simply like to get a good scare in with their friends will be satisfied, as will those who prefer a horror film with some depth and lasting effect.  It's not a classic-in-the-making, perhaps, and it's not great, but it's pretty darn good, and pretty darn scary, and those are rare in horror cinema these days.",1382400000,7,2712,4.931718061674009
5406128,5,B00AAA62TI,I HAVE NOT EVEN GOT THIS YET AND I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAID THAT IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT,1382400000,,109,3.5833333333333335

5406130,4,B00AAA62TI,"What do people do nowadays when they're having trouble with a house?  Well, they pack up their stuff, move out, and drop off the keys at the bank of course.  And stop paying their mortgages.  Well, that's at least what people did during the housing downturn in the mid-late 2000s.  If it was OK to do it then, why wasn't it OK in the early 1970s?

I've seen the Warrens on quite a few television shows over the years, and I always found them interesting.  I believe that they were on ""The Haunted,"" which wasn't too bad of a show.  Sure, I didn't always believe the stories -- or the people on the show itself -- but who cares?  It was always interesting to watch other people go through hell while I could just sit back, eat popcorn, and watch.

Which leads me to an interesting review that I partially read the other day about this film.  In that review, someone said that he didn't like this film because it ""wasn't real.""  He used different words than that but I can't repeat them on a family site.  Now, if I were to use his logic, I could make the same claims about movies such as ""Superman.""  ""Superman doesn't exist and therefore you shouldn't watch the film because it's garbage.  And you'd be stupid as well,"" might be my argument.  Well, why do you exactly have to believe in anything to like it, anyways?  Naturally, you don't.  Which is why that review was ridiculous.

What isn't exactly ridiculous:  ""The Conjuring"" itself.  I got a few good frights out of it, and I had a few jump-out-of-my-seat moments, which is really all you should expect from a horror film, isn't it?  Why is ""real"" any good anyways?  The last housing downturn was certainly ""real,"" but I surely wouldn't call it very much fun or entertaining.  But more than that, I've always been a fan of Vera Farmiga, and I thought that she did a great job of channeling Loraine Warren here, even though I believe that Ms. Warren is still alive.

Well, back to the original question, or at least the implication from it:  why didn't this family just pack up, move out, and drop the keys at the bank here instead of sticking it out with evil demons?  Well, back in the 70s, there was something called ""personal responsibility.""  And that's something that I wish would come back, unlike the nasty ghosts in this film.  Unless there is the rumored sequel, of course.",1382400000,2,2338,4.476303317535545
5406131,2,B00AAA62TI,"America is raising a generation of idiots. No, the so-called true story is nothing like the movie and the so-called true story is questionable at best, and an out and out lie at worst. The few accounts of this so-called haunting has no credible witnesses who weren't looking for 15 minutes of fame. COME ON AMERICA, ARE WE REALLY THIS STUPID TO BELIEVE THIS MOVIE COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE?! If you want to see real evil, read the news, because that is scarier than anything in this film.

The actors are brilliantly wasted in this film. This movie has the same formula used in the 1960's Vincent Price film, except the actors are better and the settings cost more money. Nothing new here people. May I quote Albert Einstein: ""Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.""

P.S. Whenever Hollywood uses the words ""based on"" it means 1% what they were told and 99% creative license.

5406133,5,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is one of the better ghost stories we have seen in the last decade or so. James Wan honed in on elements like the dark, shadows, and sound to play off fear from the audience. What also helped was the cinematography and the great camera work that made some scenes even more intense. There was much focus on the characters; especially the Warrens as they became the focus of the movie and how their ordeals in the past would resurrect again.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie even after seeing the movie a second time the scares can come off as comical but are still effective for enjoyment purposes. Some may say that too much is revealed in terms of what the unknown entity may be and becomes less interesting as the film progresses. I would argue not and say the story was balanced and kept my attention all the way through. Own this movie.",1382400000,4,861,4.484076433121019

5406135,3,B00AAA62TI,"As far as the plot goes, for a true story, it was pretty good. The sound effects are what made the movie SCAREY though. I think it was definitely exaggerated a bit, but like I said, how many times can you watch a movie and know that no one in there right mind would open a door knowing it's not a good idea, and after already being terrified enough to poop your pants? Especially children?! I think (I KNOW) I would have told my parents that I'm going to go live with Gramma. (Just an example of doing something crazy, not a spoiler.) It was a terrible thing that happened to this family, but all things considered, and I certainly DON'T mean to downplay their horrible experience, how can a lot of these things be documented as fact when no one was around to actually verify the events. In other words something that happens to one person could be exaggerated a bit...we all do it. The, ""I caught a fish THIS big"" kind of thing.
I guess I'm sounding like the cynic here, and I REALLY don't mean to at all. The true story this movie depicted was truely HORRIBLE, so If you're looking for a SCAREY movie to watch, with the lights off, don't have a bowl of popcorn in your lap if your volume is turned up. Lol. Since I never was much of a horror movie fan, although I've always been scared by the witch on the Wizard of Oz, most are very predictable to me. It's just always been the sound effects that made me jump out of my seat. Trust me though, this movie definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next. So it wasn't a half-bad movie at all, I was just a little disappointed after reading all the reviews saying that it was such a great movie.",1382400000,3,1677,4.2274143302180685

5406161,4,B00AAA62TI,"""The Conjuring"" is my favorite type of supernatural horror film. It has deeper meaning to it than just getting people scared. Everything about it is top shelf solid quality horror. I also applaud any movie that makes people think about the reality of God and the Devil.

The Perron family is terrorized by what they come to believe is a spiritual presence in their home. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren come to the family's aid and discover that it's not only haunted but dwelled in by the demonic spirit of a witch who cursed the land she was hung on. Can the Warrens find a way to rid the house of the evil before it takes a tragic toll on the Perrons?

Although it's based on actual events, everyone knows ""The Conjuring"" has been sensationalized for a movie-going audience. That doesn't change the fact that it demands its audience ponder the existence of a spiritual world outside of the physical one we can see, touch, hear, and smell. It also makes a point of letting you know that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it's not real.

The biggest scares you'll get from ""The Conjuring"" aren't even necessarily the ones you'll see and hear onscreen. I found myself more frightened after the film ended. I was left thinking about it in the ""real"" world. That's the beauty of a great horror film - it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.

Let's just call it like it is. ""The Conjuring"" is the ""Amityville Horror"" of this decade. There's a lot of speculation around the Amityville house, but it's famous and put this movie's paranormal detectives in in the headlines and on TV. This is a story so fascinating that you don't want to believe it. However, somewhere in the back of your head you know it's true.

""The Conjuring"" is rated R for sequences of disturbing violence and terror. There's no nudity in the film. Some bad language can be found as well.

The DVD version of ""The Conjuring"" includes a short featurette taking viewers behind the scenes of the film. It's entitled ""Scaring the ""@$*%"" Out of You"" and features interviews with the cast and crew. It's not much, but gives you an insight into what it takes to make this type of film.

Many Christians and religious folks will no doubt disagree with demonic possession being used as a vehicle for entertainment. I look at it as an opportunity to expose and educate a generation of people who have come to believe in nothing and just live life the best they can in spiritual darkness. I know that's pretty heavy thinking put into what most look at as a horror movie.

""The Conjuring"" has everything you could want in one supernatural film. There's the old creepy house, demons, ghosts, a hanging tree, a freaky doll, and so much more. I can't think of a single genre item it missed. The funny thing is, it doesn't feel over-stuffed or like it's going to burst at the seams. It's just a good old-fashioned supernatural thriller that will entertain and make the audience ponder it well past the closing credits.",1382054400,4,3022,4.635514018691588
5406162,5,B00AAA62TI,"No real blood or guts; just real, old fashioned scares. Based in the '70s and on a true story, this film really hit the mark and scared the crap out of us more than one or two times. Great storyline, well flushed out characters and excellent filmography.

5406163,2,B00AAA62TI,"Take ""The Amityville Horror"" (which has been disproved time and again) and add the film The Exorcist, (which is fiction)  then sprinkle a dash of the innocent people who lost their lives during The Salem Witch Trials (wow, stoop any lower?) - and voila!  You have this film.

The only redeeming factors for me were Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor (who hasn't aged hardly at all..fabulous actress)!.  James Wan's direction in this was almost ""homemade"" (i.e. paranormal activity)...and of course the ""world renowned demonologist"" and his famously clairvoyant wife..(really???) were ready, willing and able to do interviews. Charlatans much?  Hubby is absurd with his cross wielding ""onward christian soldier/warrior stance"". (he is a demonologist, but not ridiculous enough to believe in vampires) *snicker*  And the wife, herself would be called a ""soothsayer"" and therefore, according to their own tenet laws in Christianity - a witch herself.

So, no, this is not for rational people, because as a reasonable, rational human being you will find horrible flaws that make the story even more difficult to believe (I don't believe it at all), and rational movie watchers want to see things less religious, and closer to ""maybe!"" ..that don't claim to be true.  And religion is just TOO real..and too ridiculous.  Even the beginning states that Ed Warren is ""recognised by the Catholic Church"".  ahaha  That was really all I needed to know - yet I did watch it; there were parts that I liked (usually involving Lili or Vera) but the story and direction were flat.  Two stars for the ladies and kid's acting.  Nothing for Wan, religion nor anyone else.  Especially not the Perron charlatan who wrote the book many years after it supposedly happened so that no one can prove it wrong.  Ahhh the ""devil"" really is in the details.",1382054400,5,1821,5.003322259136213
5406164,5,B00AAA62TI,"For most of this movie, I was mesmerized. The performances are terrific, which is not a surprise considering the cast and special props to the young girls who are very good as well. The moments that we are set up are genuinely scary without being too overt. It takes skill to scare. The director did a magnificent job with this film. It still gets to me just thinking of it. And it is old-fashioned in that regard. It rarely gives us the shaky cam look I cannot stand. There is little CGI. Not much blood or gore. I have seen it four times. And it is something special.

SPOILERS

Then we get to the exorcism. That is the only part where I felt the film lost its way. It's not bad at all but doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the film. I guess it is eventual that they had to up the ante on the film level but I was still a bit disappointed.

Not enough to stop me from loving this very scary film. It is a film that is fun and scary to watch simultaneously.

And I enjoyed the extra features, particularly the interview with the family who experienced this (although how much of it is not said). The mother talks about even today she is scared and won't go back to the house. Although I heard from someone who recently said she 'must' go back. And then she won't even watch this film. It suddenly dawned on me that whatever she experienced, it was certainly real to her and to her family.

No matter how much, or how little, of this film is based on actual events, I don't really care that much. Because it is a film. Not a documentary. They are trying to create entertainment. With that in mind, this is one of the very best horror movies ever made. Even with the ending exorcism I feel the rest of the film more than compensates.

If your idea of horror is the bloodier, the gorier, the slashier the better? You will be disappointed in The Conjuring.

If you like your horror subtle with the silent creaking of a door opening sending chills up your spine? This movie is for you.

For this time of year especially, I give it my highest recommendation.",1382054400,3,2055,4.26478149100257

This movie is different sometimes it builds suspense and nothing happens and other times when you think you have time to catch your breath something crazy happens.

Even though it ""loans"" from such archetypes as Amityville, The Exorcist and the Legend of Hell House (to name but a few). My general impression, though, is that some (perhaps significant) sequences are missing (or were cut for whatever reason in the editing room), and as a result there is a general feeling of dangling scenario avenues, of incoherence - it never becomes really frightening. This is particularly true for the ending: abrupt, lacking continuity and somewhat unsatisfying. An element that I found moderately irritating was the heavy reference to christinaty, even though no priest was actually involved. And another aggravation came from the non-use of the demonic doll, extensively shown in the pre-tiltes.",1381968000,3,831,5.303030303030303
5406174,4,B00AAA62TI,"Well, when I stumbled upon this film it looked really interesting, and I gave it a shot. I'm really glad I did. Horror movies of our current generation are extremely predictable and go too far; they have too many special effects, use actors that are well known, show too much gore, and they lack the psychological thrill that old 70's horror movies possess. The Conjuring did not lack mood or psychological intensity at all. It reminded me of the Excorcist and truly scared me. There are some jump scenes (which I admit I am totally freaked out by), but the camera work and pace was really well done. Someone else commented that they thought some of the scariest scenes were in the first half of the film and I agree... They weren't based off of scary faces flashing in front of your face, but just downright freaky! Terrifying music, coupled with down right freakish occurrences make for a really scary movie that you will want to watch again!

For all the positive hype and claims of it being the scariest film EVER,I found it no more scary then the 1979 version of ""Amityville Horror""(I refuse to acknowledge the existence of the modern version)Don't get me wrong,it was a nice little throwback to that film and others and I feel the quality of the product was good. Maybe not as classic and original as the 1963 version of ""the Haunting"" or Richard Matheson's ""Hell House"" but it did have some fun moments. Cannot complain about the acting or cinematography,effort was put into this. But it did fail to elicit any shudders,gasps,or lingering fears. I feel like I should have calmed my chomping at the bit to see this and waited till Amazon brought it down to the usual 2.99 rent/9.99 own. Lastly,please remember,this is just one Man's opinion. It is no more or less valid then those who claim this is cinematic greatness. If you managed to get the absolute chills from this film,then I kinda envy you.

5406179,4,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is a hard film to place: on the one hand you love it for its fresh take on a dried out genre, but on the other the same cliches that it denounces in the first half are welcomed in and made house guests for the second half. It  keeps one foot one step behind and the other forward into uncharted territory. However, one thing is clear: from the haunting violins that permeate its atmosphere to its incredible cinematography, you will be enthralled from beginning to end with its fantastic execution.

The cinematography is pitch perfect. James Wan isn't afraid to use a camera for what it is, a medium for artistic expression. Everything is shot beautifully and the angles are just right, so that they keep things suspenseful and frightening. The soundtrack is phenomenal.  Whether it's a song from the 70s or a screeching violin it creates an atmosphere that is rarely seen in modern cinema.

Vera Formiga and Patrick Wilson steal the show as a ghostbusting couple named Ed and Lorraine Warren (based on the real life Warrens), who must help a family to remove a demonic presence that has taken occupance in their new home. The Warrens carry enough vigor and zeal that you hardly think them crazy for keeping a basement filled with demonic artifacts. They are the good guys in every sense and you'll be rooting for them from beginning to end. The Perrons are a brady bunch-esque family with, gasp, likable personalities. And this is really the strength of the film, the connection between the viewer and the family as they get through their nightmare.

The acting is spectacular, save a few characters (I'm looking at you Deputy Dan). Among the children actors Joey King
steals the show with very believable emotion. You don't have to be a clairvoyant to see that she has a promising future.

The film dipped into comical more times than comfortable. Near the final act it leaves its subtle roots that made it so good, and goes for the modern, in-your-face scares that we've all grown tired of It's more of a lasagna, there's cheese in every bite, but the meat and pasta are still there, and satisfying.

With all this said the movie would be a mere 3-stars. So why am I giving it four? Because the first half of the movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen in the genre. It is truly scary and completely magnetizing. The apex of the film's greatness, unfortunately, is around the basement scene, which, if you've seen the trailer, you've already seen. From there on out the film slowly begins to decline until it ends on a disappointing note.

Perhaps the Conjuring misses getting to the lofty heights of horror giants such as the Exorcist and Alien, but
for how far it has climbed it is an achievement, and for that worth multiple viewings with friends and unsuspecting relatives.",1381795200,4,2800,4.688391038696538

5406186,3,B00AAA62TI,"There are three basic reviews of this film.

THE BELIEVER: Best movie ever, especially when you consider that it's BASED ON A TRUE STORY! So scary to think that there's that kind of evil in the world, but also so reaffirming that there are God-fearing people like the Warren's doing the Lord's good work. Oh, also the movie was well-done.

THE NON-BELIEVER: Stupid, stupid, stupid. I can't believe these con artists are getting another movie made about their hucksterism. Wake up, people. The Warrens were awful people who preyed on the hopes of the ignorant and desperate. Oh, also the movie was pretty much like every other horror movie.

THE HORROR LOVER: Horror movies are my guilty pleasure. I don't care what the story or budget was, I'll watch it. There are a lot of reasons for this, the primary one being that -- as rare as they are to find -- truly great horror movies can have an effect that lasts much longer than many dramas, comedies or shoot-em-ups. There's a vicarious thrill of survival that comes with an amazing horror film that makes you feel alive and appreciate the fragility of your own mortality. Because of this, I'll watch them all. Every single one.

Of course, you can't watch that many horror movies without admitting that 95% of them are just plain awful. Laughable, usually. Maybe 0.09% of them are really great and memorable. The remaining 4.01% are somewhere in the middle, and that's where THE CONJURING falls on the scale.

Is the movie well-done? Absolutely. There are strong performances (especially by some of the daughters), great cinematography and camera work, and fairly seamless special effects.

Is the movie derivative? You bet. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of a single part of the film that is unique. You've got invisible spirits flinging people around. Pictures falling from walls. Creepy kids' voices. Ghosts appearing in flashes in mirrors. Strange bruises. Dogs that refuse to go in the house. A spooky basement. Witches. Corpses floating under water. There's even a creepy doll. For this, I'm afraid it loses major points. If you aren't the horror lover that I am and don't often watch scary films, you'll be suitably scared, I think. But seasoned viewers won't be seeing anything that they won't be able to predict pretty much every step of the way.

Even this would warrant 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if it weren't for a few annoying plot contrivances that really took me out of the film. For instance, the Warrens constantly refer to God (Mrs. Warren is fond of explaining how God brought her and her husband together), but their religious beliefs feel tacked on, shallow, and meaningless. My favorite part? Mr. Warren, fearing for his wife's sanity and safety, suggests that he and her skip this particular spookfest and concentrate their energies on writing a book. Mrs. Warren's response? She scoffs and says with great disdain, ""I don't think God brought us together just to write a book."" Ha ha! Yeah. Since when has God ever wanted people to write a stupid book for Him?

This kind of smugness in the characters is sporadic, but when it shows up, it is very distracting. Another example would be the fact that, for some reason, they keep totems from every exorcism and de-haunting in glass cases in their home. You'd think people this religious would, I don't know, swallow their pride and NOT keep previously possessed dolls in the same house they share with their young daughter. I'm no exorcist, though, so maybe that's a thing they do.

Finally, I was bothered by the fact that the title of the film really has nothing to do with the story, as well as the fact that the credits show us actual photos of the Warrens and the family from the film, really trying to hammer home that all of this was (based on) REALITY. Considering the subject matter, it's a little unfortunate that they try to Blair-Witch it with the hazy line that exists between truth and fiction, and even more so that -- if this story IS true and the Warrens WERE doing God's work -- I really doubt God brought them together just to make a scary movie. Right, Mrs. Warren?

Ha ha. Just kidding. I don't really care.",1381708800,3,4152,4.730290456431535

As an avid fan of horror films I will say that I have seen much worse than this.  The movie has some very popular ""scares"" in it.  I won't give anything away but if you have seen the Insidious films you will find the similarities.  The movie is fun to watch, the acting is campy but in comparison to some other horror films I have seen the acting is decent and the story is pretty good.  I won't get into a comparison between real life and the movie because that matter little to me when watching a horror film.

5406195,4,B00AAA62TI,"'True Story' haunted house and possession movies are a dime a dozen these days. Anything that can be cheaply made by studios to rake in tons of dough at the box office are automatics (this is why Paranormal Activity could essentially continue on forever). In my mind the definitive haunted house movie will always be The Poltergeist, and the standard equivalent of the possession movie will always be The Exorcist. Not surprising right?

However, both of those movies were not specifically based on true stories. This is where The Conjuring comes in. You can only sing the same song so many times before it gets old and tiresome, The Conjuring puts a genuine twist on the story by making it feel like every moment in the film is honest and forthright without using the 'documentary' style filmmaking (which I always thought was a cheap gimmick). The use of the practical makeup helps recreate the feel that The Exorcist gave us the first time we saw it. It is also worth noting that James Wan, director of the original Saw and Insidious, continues his successful efforts here as a horror filmmaker.

The Conjuring will grip and horrify you like very few movies can these days. I promise it will be one of the scariest movies that you will ever see.",1381622400,14,1248,4.69406392694064

WOW. This movie is not perfect, but it's pretty damned good.

I could tell almost immediately that this was a cut above most horror movies. The direction was tight, the music was awesome, and the acting much better than the usual fare.

As I watched this movie longer, I began to appreciate it even more. There were parts of the movie where I knew exactly what was going to happen. ""How dumb do you think I am?"" I muttered.

As it turns out, pretty dumb, because every single time I thought I had spotted a genre cliche', damned if the movie didn't pull a left turn on me and catch me completely by surprise. I watch a lot of movies, and I can't tell you what a rare joy it is for me to find a movie that repeatedly catches me by surprise. It just doesn't happen; but it did this time!

In terms of atmosphere, writing, and acting, I'd place this film at one notch below ""The Others"", and several notches above nearly every other horror film I've seen in recent years. I'm so glad I gave this movie a try!

We actually moved to the very front row so we could enjoy the movie. However, moving away from the crowd didn't help. My friend and I both found this movie to be extremely corny. The acting was pretty good ( I love Lilli and Vera, especially), and the plot was pretty interesting. I personally don't mind when a movie borrows heavily from other films, as this one obviously did, as long as it improves upon the original material. After the first 45 minutes, it became apparent that this movie was not going to live up to the hype. I think the main problems were that the script was sloppy and the special effects were weak and cheap looking. It was particularly disappointing to feel the suspense build....to nothing. In the end, I really found the suspenseful scenes to be disappointing and the script poorly written. It also might have been better had the

5406208,5,B00AAA62TI,"First off, let me state that I'm not the kind of person whom normally gets ""scared"" of movies. I've watched the Exorcist plenty of times. For me, a movie is only as good as it's story. If there are a few scares thrown in, that's always good, but the scares are only going to get you once and then the next time you watch it, you already know what's coming. That being said, The Conjuring actually had me shaking the first time I watched it. The last 15 minutes were more intense than anything in my first viewing of the Exorcist. The comparisons to The Exorcist are inevitable. More so because it's the only movie in league with The Conjuring than because it's the same type of film (demonic entities, exorcism, and possession)

The acting; the story; the sets; the sound design; the camera work; all of it is done perfectly, allowing you to go on a journey with this family and experience the horror as they experience it. The story itself is base on a true one, and all you need to do is Google search it to find out that it's no joke. In fact, Hollywood actually had to dub down this story. The real one took place over a nearly a decade's worth of time, and some of the stuff that happened had to be altered because producers though nobody would actually believe the stuff that really happened if they saw it on screen!

Anyone who enjoys a good thriller or supernatural story owes it to themselves to give The Conjuring a look. It's not really a ""horror"" film per-say, but it's a darn good film regardless!",1381190400,3,1511,4.392857142857143
5406209,5,B00AAA62TI,"Movies I love include ""A Haunting in Connecticut"", the 2005 ""Amityville House"", and ""Dead Silence"" so if you hated those, you might not like The Conjuring.

I loved the feel of this movie, it actually feels like the classic creepy, supernatural, haunting horror movies I remember from the 90's (Before the genre committed suicide). After becoming numb to the mindless ""found footage"", ""crazy serial killer"" and  ""teen scream"" horrors I'm excited that Hollywood is giving tradition another chance. The acting and script are awesome, cinematography perfect.

Bear in mind, I can only name 3 horror movies I love, The Conjuring has joined the list. For all those who hated it because it wasn't scary or the scares were predictable, after watching as many horror movies as I have you realize nothing is original and nothing creeps you out anymore. But for normal people who aren't obsessed with Supernatural Horrors as I am, The Conjuring is extremely entertaining. For horror buffs like myself, its worth a watch.

Just a random fact,  although the case depicted in this film was one of the scariest Lorraine Warren (the psychic who the lead character is based on) ever investigated, she still maintains that the Amityville house is the one case she hopes to never revisit.

5406210,2,B00AAA62TI,"Seriously, I was so disappointed by this movie.  I heard so much about it, especially how it was genuinely scary without a lot of gore or cheap scares.  However, it is absurd.  There is a lot of unintentionally hilarous dialogue from the Warrens.  Once the demonic possession starts, things really go downhill.  I am tempted to give this one star, but I guess it isn't that bad... well, it is pretty bad.  Don't believe the hype, this one is boring and corny.",1381190400,5,459,4.536585365853658
5406211,2,B00AAA62TI,"I'm a bit mystified as to why this did so well at the box office. It didn't feature anything you haven't seen in a dozen other films in this genre (supernatural horror). The scares ranged between a mix of telegraphed ""boo!"" moments you saw coming ten miles away (hence ""telegraphed"") and the unfair (and cheap) tactic of having something suddenly appear out of the corner of the frame accompanied by a loud spike in the music. Come on--does that even count? My neighbor pulls the same crap every Halloween when he hides in the bushes and leaps out at trick-or-treaters. Of COURSE you're going to jump when something appears out of nowhere, we're human beings and it's in our physiology. Scaring people this way in a horror film is low brow.

The performances were fine, no complaints there. The dialogue could have used some polishing, though. ""Something awful happened here, Ed."" Sometimes the trite and corny lines feel like they came out of a Lifetime movie on the subject.

The supernatural presence isn't terribly menacing once you realize this is a by-the-numbers horror flick and no one you care about is in any danger of dying. What you're left with is ""shocking"" footage of the entity dragging people around the house like rag dolls with no subtlety whatsoever. If you like your horror in-your-face and over-the-top, you'll love it.

Make no mistake, this is a modern ghost story and it suffers every pitfall all modern horror films suffer from. Why it stood out of the pack this year, I have no idea. This is not some modern classic although it is VERY modern. It is another part of the ""new"" supernatural horror that seems to be taking over the box office and it has absolutely nothing original to offer.",1381190400,7,1715,4.729096989966555
5406212,4,B00AAA62TI,"...it might be something like this.  The Conjuring is by far James Wan's best film with many ingenious and well rendered visual ideas.  Many people have noted its classic approach to scares, but it is also a very Hollywood take on horror, for better and worse.  The film stars a Sherlock Holmes esque demon hunter, his wife who is a medium, and an almost cornily sweet family who are the victims.  On the plus side the film has some great uncompromising visual effects, lovely cinematography, and a great milieu that reads like a cross between The Shining and The Others.  The Conjuring isn't nearly as creepy or original as either of those films, but it makes up for it in wit and execution.  This is very much the horror movie for people who don't normally like horror movies.",1381104000,5,778,4.601449275362318
5406213,5,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring came out of nowhere from horror-noir director James Wan. It takes the best of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, Sinister, and Dark Skies, and crams it into a 2-hour long roller coaster ride from hell. A nostalgic throwback story, incredible acting, heart-pounding sound effects, and beautiful cinematography make The Conjuring one the best made horror movies I have ever seen. James Wan dowses this movie with a thick fog of atmosphere and layers on the escalating bass notes when the action peaks. One after another, the scares keep coming like roaring train cars, hurdling along the rails at breakneck speed.

Ed and Lorraine Warren are the movie's protagonists. The couple is based on their real-life counterparts, whose paranormal research came into the national spotlight after the infamous Amityville House case. Both actors who play the pair (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga), look as if they have been plucked from the 70's with their retro outfits, folksy manners, and believable reactions to ongoing events. The beautiful Rhode Island home that is the movie's primary set piece is so overflowing with spectral activity and gothic stylings that it should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor during the 2013 Oscars. It's curse is far-reaching to the point that the Warrens own daughter Judy is attacked by the evil entity in their family home, many miles away from the possessed farmhouse.

The family in peril is the Perrons. Roger and Carolyn have five daughters between themselves. Joey King, who plays the curly blond sister, stands out above the rest with her startling performance. The fear ricochets off each daughter and infects the parents, who are forced to seek the Warrens assistance out of sheer terror. Ed and Lorraine set up shop at their country estate, and discover that an evil entity has latched onto the family. Ed is no man of the cloth, and contacts a Catholic Priest to perform an Exorcism. The dumbfounded Clergyman ogles Ed's videotaped evidence, lets out a deep exhale, and informs Ed that the green light would have to come from the Vatican itself. With time running out, Ed takes the demon on mano-a-mano.

Months after The Conjuring's theatrical run, James Wan followed up with the lackluster sequel to Insidious. It seems as if he used all of his good ideas on the former, while the latter's rushed feel could have been the result of pressure from studio executives. James Wan recently issued a public statement proclaiming that he would no longer direct movies in the horror genre, and instead wants to focus on other types of films. This is no surprise as this movie is Wan's magnum opus, and cannot be outdone utilizing the director's current idea bank. The Conjuring goes down as the scariest movie since The Exorcist.",1381017600,5,2773,5.010845986984815
5406214,5,B00AAA62TI,"Oh yes. This is the same director as SAW, James Wan. He has been paying his dues, and with The Conjuring, he has struck wicked, menacing, spine-chilling, demon-breathing-down-your-neck gold.

From open to close, the silences and the suspense are filmed so well, you can't help but be immersed, and actually feel the scares up close and personal.

Based on true events, this tells the story of a New England family who encounters spirits in their farmhouse, and then call in paranormal experts, who help them do battle with some wicked-haunting supernatural powers.

This is the real deal, suspense horror lovers. Check it out.

I believe that the great triumph of the movie is how much it invests in its characters - they are three-dimensional human beings with whom you can identify with (and in a horror movie, that is crucial!). The moment you put yourself in their shoes is the moment the movie wins you over. By the end of the movie, I was in pains over what was happening BECAUSE I cared about whom it was happening to.

After being duped by ""Insidious"" and ""VHS"", I went into ""The Conjuring"" somewhat excited but also cautious, and I was right. Although a decent horror flick compared to most crap unspooling in Hollywood these days, ""Conjuring"" is not all that frightening or for that matter ... original. While it does have a couple of cool scares, the ending was a huge letdown to me; way way too sweet and up, as if the producers and studio was afraid to send audiences out the door with their teeth chattering. ""Conjuring"" is pale compared to ""Sinister"" or ""VHS 2"" (which blew me away at times) but it's not wasted time in front of a screen either. As for the rating, 'R' for being too scary? Hardly. If this is a fact, then the MPAA seriously needs to be replaced with a panel of people who know how to properly rate movies. Better yet, get rid of the whole dumb rating system entirely. This film is a PG-13 at the most. Compare it to the 1976 film ""Burnt Offerings"" which received a 'PG' and yet went places with unpredictable terror and violence, along with an incredibly dark ending, that to this day cannot be matched or will ever be matched by a PG rated movie.

5406228,5,B00AAA62TI,"You don't see a lot of horror movies anymore. Oh sure, you see lots of movies with obnoxious characters meeting messy, violent ends, but that is more revolting than horrifying.

So ""The Conjuring"" has a strangely timeless, old-school feel to its story -- the entire first half of the movie is devoted to building up the creeping, shadowy feeling that something terrible is lurking just out of sight, followed by a second half of nightmare fuel. That second half is a bit less gripping, but still pretty good vintage horror.

Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) move into a rather shabby farmhouse with their five daughters. Almost immediately, strange things start happening -- their dog is killed, birds crash into the house, Carolyn finds inexplicable bruises on her body, and the children are tormented by mysterious things in their bedroom. Then Carolyn is locked in the basement by a ghost.

Desperate for help, Carolyn begs paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) to come see her house. They immediately conclude that there is a supernatural force at work here, and that it should be exorcised. But the malevolent forces in the Perron house are working fast, and the Warrens may have to take matters into their own hands to save the family.

""The Conjuring""  feels like a much older movie than it actually is -- the slightly faded sepia tone, the lack of sex and gore, the old farmhouse with peeling paint, and the antique furniture wreathed in shadows. And with no initial explanation of just WHAT is haunting the Perron family, you're left wondering what is going on.

That sense of mystery is what makes the first half of the movie so intensely spooky -- nothing is seen. Instead, James Wan builds up a slow, creeping sense of horror that seeps into the most innocent of actions, using things that you cannot see -- a nasty smell, a shuffling in the dark, a mysterious bruise,  a tugging on a kid's leg, an unseen specter lurking behind a door.

In fact, the second half is less effectively horrific because we actually start SEEING things (people yanked around on wires, ghosts vomiting themselves into someone's mouth). The movie's biggest flaw is that early on, the Warrens declare that ghosts don't possess people... and yet they never mention this declaration when TA-DA! an evil ghost is found. It's a bit confusing.

It also has uniformly amazing performances -- Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are amazing as the professional demonologists, believing that this is a God-given duty. But they give some nice nuance to their characters, with Ed's concern over his wife's well-being and Lorraine's serene awareness of the supernatural.

And they have equally good performances by Livingston and Taylor, nice ordinary people who find themselves in the grip of something dark and malevolent. And the kids who play their daughters prove that there are excellent child actors out there -- the scene where Joey King tearfully whispers about ""something behind the door"" is enough to make your spine creep.

""The Conjuring"" shows a bit too much in its second half, but it doesn't stop this quietly atmospheric movie from being astoundingly creepy -- partly because of what we never see,",1378166400,4,3252,4.970534069981584

- You get easily offended by the use of religious objects in movies
- You simply don't like this genre of movies

If you don't fit the above criteria, then you might end up enjoying this movie. For starters, it really is kind of old school scary in a way, with wonderful image, sound and focus management to create a suspense environment that will leave you at the edge of your seat.

I read this is based on a true story of Ed and Lorraine Warren. There are many things explained along the movie that to this day are true, and not a product of fiction.

5406233,5,B00AAA62TI,"When I first heard about this movie, I was not all that impressed, even after seeing a couple of trailers.  The reason for this is because of the so-called horror movies that have come out in recent years, namely The Haunting in Connecticut.

Well I was WRONG when I saw this movie!  And I'm glad I was.  Not only is The Conjuring incredibly creepy (and a true story), but it's not scary because of special effects; there were barely any used.  The actors were incredible.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren were spot on.  I really also liked that this movie was basically told from their perspective of what they did for people living in haunted houses.  I was reminded of The Amityville Horror (the original, not the remake) because the events in The Conjuring took place in the 1970s and the director thankfully didn't try to modernize that like they did with Haunting in Connecticut.

The other actors, Lili Taylor especially were very convincing!  I have always liked her as an actress and I'm glad that she finally got to play a different type of character than she usually does in movies/TV.

What I especially enjoyed about this movies was the music.  It was just creepy.  And when you expected something to appear or happen because of music cues...it didn't.  That just made it even scarier.  There were times when I was sure something was going to happen...and then we move to the next scene.  Very well done horror movie and I was really impressed that the classic horror movie was brought back here.  I really hope that filmmakers continue to do this when they make another horror/thriller.

The storyline involving the Warrens is interesting and well developed, showing how their past investigations have taken a toll on them. However, the movie does not give us a lot of background to the Perron Family, leaving the audience unsympathetic towards them.

There were many moments in the movie when the sound track things popping out at the audience make the audience jump.

5406238,1,B00AAA62TI,"What is a ""true story""? Inception is a story, and as far as we accept that it's a story, there's a truth to the events. When we watch the movie, we are all witnessing the same story, and therefore, we can agree on objective facts about the story. There are characters. They have names. Events happen in a particular order. These are all truths, and so something must exist beyond the fiction for us to call a ""true story"". I have no doubt in my mind that the Warrens, those fantastic hucksters, have woven a narrative surrounding this family and some possibly difficult times for them. The question, however, is whether that story, which is itself a truth, accurately reflects reality, or if it was spawned from the imagination with little or no help from reality. That's an important question, even more than just asking ""Is it a good horror movie?"", because now the movie is requiring us to suspend our suspension of disbelief. Anytime I watch a horror movie or play a scary game, I have to temporarily disconnect myself from the world I know (suspend my disbelief), otherwise I will never be immersed enough to achieve catharsis, and the whole experience will be a waste of my time. Indeed, the effort on the part of the creator will be a failure as well, as this is the entire point of storytelling, insofar as I can tell. Because The Conjuring is claimed to be a story that accurately reflects reality (members from the Perron family and the remaining Warren both assert this), I now have to prevent myself from suspending my disbelief in the movie, instead suspending my belief in reality (which is considerably harder to do because I have a lot more experience in reality than I do in the Warren's distorted, funhouse mirror version of it).

**Spoilers here**

The Warrens are a religious people. Their take on the supernatural has a distinctly Biblical tone. The plot could only seem reasonable to the Biblically inclined. I would even say that it's an embarrassingly bad plot, even compared to other religiously themed horror movies, which almost always fall on the poor side of a genre that typically produces poor material to begin with.

***Last chance spoiler alert***

The primary antagonistic entity is a witch. Yeah, a witch. One of the ""first to be condemned in the Salem witch trials"", to paraphrase Loraine from the movie. The witch sacrificed her newborn to Satan, and then committed suicide, which gave her spirit a great deal of physical power (of course.... of course). There are some other ghosts that make a brief appearance, all victims of the witch's power to make a mother kill her child. This is what witches do, no doubt, and clearly those fundamentalist maniacs running the witch trials were right to murder two dozen people - there was a real witch! She actually got power from Satan, and 200 years later, the Warrens were there to finally save the day, God be praised! So, in order to suspend my disbelief for this movie, I have to accept not only the Warrens' version of events, but various Christian doctrines and the ""prosecutors"" of the Salem witch trials. As a result, rather than scaring, or even interesting me, this movie just had me rolling my eyes. Often times, such movies will at least allow a character to go through a crisis of faith, and then I can find value in it - either they lose it entirely, or they regain it with a new understanding, but regardless, the character develops in some way. No so for this shameless faith-fest, where not only does the nasty witch get defeated sans character development, but it's a simple Christian ritual that saves the day, as though there could be no other possibility. True story!

**End of spoilers***

Aside from the inherent ridiculousness of the plot, the movie is generally lame in every other dimension. The scares were typical, uninspired rip offs of every other haunted house movie. This is likely because so many movies we're familiar with today are themselves ripping off the Amityville horror, which is another true fiction from the minds of the Warrens. The acting was generally awful whenever it called for an emotion other than 'frozen in terror''. The dialog is clunky and as difficult to believe as the rest of the film, and it certainly felt like the actors had better things they could be doing with their lives at the time. Characters were cardboard cutouts that stood in for anything we might relate to as a human being, but being so thin, fail to inspire empathy. To be sure, the worst part of the movie is the lack of any real progression from the characters. A true story must still be a story regardless of how well it reflects reality, and for a story to be a story, we have to find the characters sufficiently believable. Instead, no one had any personality, which is surprising for characters based on ""real"" people. No one changed. No one grew, or learned, or became anything different by the end of the movie. Every face in the film is an empty vessel, and watching them was both painful and boring.

For those of you who are wondering whether to watch this movie, chances are good that no amount of bad reviews will put you off. You're either too bored to care, or you're a horror junky and will watch even the crappiest of the crap. If you're a fan of the Warrens, you've probably already watched it and won't be reading this review. If I can sway you from this film, then please accept this warning and go watch something worth your time. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a good one with overt Christian themes, if that's your thing. The Innkeepers, the Woman in Black or Sinister could fulfill your supernatural needs much better. If you can't find a movie that will be a suitable replacement, then think about a new hobby. Music, photography, chess or stamp collecting would all be a far better use of your time. Failing even a new hobby, try just knocking yourself unconscious somehow. Anything is better than sitting through the latest tripe from James Wan, and certainly better than giving more money to the Warrens. The only truth to this story is that the story is so truly bad, and told is such a lackluster, empty and vapid way that a potentially entertaining horror movie becomes a frustrating exercise in reconciling your view of reality with a liar's tale.",1376784000,31,6286,4.683257918552036

5406243,4,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is about two paranormal investigators (Ed & Lorraine Warren) who help the Perron family that has moved into a haunted house. It is partly based on a true story. In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research and opened the The Warren's Occult Museum. They claimed to have investigated over 10,000 hauntings during their career. The Warrens were among the very first investigators in the controversial Amityville haunting. Though Ed passed in 2006 (in real life), Lorraine is still involved as a clairvoyant and trance medium. Automatically the film will be compared to Poltergeist, Amityville Horror and Paranormal Activity. It stands up quite well for modern audiences. As the supernatural turns their lives upside down the film provides shades of ""Poltergeist"" where the family, investigators and a local cop try to gather evidence and suppress the evil. Plenty of jump scares. While it isn't perfect I give The Conjuring some credit for being a fairly good horror movie (Hollywood seemingly hasn't been able to do much of that since the 1980s). The performances are good and the story works but it can be predictable in parts. I wouldn't say it is absolutely terrifying but it does have some good moments. It seems moviegoers can't stomach the old R-Rated horror films anymore so The Conjuring manages to bring some of the old magic back. I am happy it grossed over $100 million in the US and even more worldwide. Hopefully more R-Rated horror movies will be made. Director James Wan also did the original Saw but this film isn't quite as shocking as that one. There isn't much in the way of gore at all compared to Saw but the film works well as a supernatural suspense story.

Just about anything you can think of that could cause you horror from moving dolls to demonic possessions to ghost there are all included in this movie.  And James Wan uses his talents exceptionally well here.  He is unrelentless in creating a constantly intense filled environment where that will make your heart stop many times over.

When I watch a horror film, I simply leave all manner of reasoning and rational thinking at the door and watch for entertainment only.  With this said, I pretty much enjoyed the film.  It was a bit far-fetched but I just overlooked it.

I really appreciate that it did not contain any inappropriate scenes/sexual content and the language was clean.  Hence, I rate it a 3.5.  Wait.

What?

Oh you don't give 1/2 marks?

Okay.  Fine Then.  4.

The movie succeeded in scaring my poor husband to death but failed to have the same affect on me.  It's just that I see through Hollywood's lies.  These ghost/demon films basically depict the demons/entities as immensely powerful and dangerous forces that we are powerless to stop and the only ones that can save us is the Catholic system.  Okay....
Like really?

And people buy into this hype.  I am a believer and I read my Bible so I see past the lies and I'm able to watch these movies and just chuckle.  I've had personal experiences with familiar spirits and demons and yes, it's scary, but Christ did a finished work on the cross and I have power to trample on every serpent and scorpion without being harmed.

5406252,4,B00AAA62TI,"At this point, the catchphrase, ""based on a true story,"" has been attached to so many middling horror movies that it has lost whatever sort of potency it might have once held. Yet, in the case of The Conjuring, the tag created a personal sense of excitement and foreboding. I've met the movie's paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, on a handful of occasions. I grew up in the same part of Connecticut they resided, and would see them at local restaurants and once attended one of their lectures. This isn't to say I particularly believe their claims, but our neck of the woods was known for an inordinate number of alleged hauntings and I always got a kick out of the local color having these kooks around added to our otherwise boring New England town.

This is far from the first film to turn to the Warrens for inspiration, who were allegedly more than eager to see their claims thrown up on a big screen. But it is, as far as I know of, the first time Ed and Lorraine have been the protagonists in a film. Played by Vera Famiga and Patrick Wilson, the duo might be a little bland in their cool professional approach to the supernatural, but they're a perfect vehicle for investigating the paranormal, taking a backseat to the macabre case at hand.

By my tally, The Conjuring is the ten-thousandth retelling of the Amityville Horror. While not specifically based on the 1979 quasi-classic or the alleged real life account, it lifts liberally from the story and the ""facts"" surrounding the event. After introducing the Warrens via the Case of the Obviously Incredibly Haunted Doll, the film cuts to the Perron family settling into their beautiful new home in bucolic middle of nowhere. Right from the start it's obvious there's something up with the house, and the movie takes it's time cranking up the heat from bumps in the night to gleefully over the top demon possession.

It's a haunted house storyline you've experienced a million times before, but The Conjuring really excels in the telling. Director James Wan, still best known the original Saw, trades gratuitous gore for long pauses and dark shadows that build unbearable tension. It's the kind of movie where the audience yells at the screen for the characters to get the hell out of the house, helmed by a director who knows how to stretch the tension until you open you're eyes back up before letting something nasty loose from the dark.

The Conjuring smartly cribs off golden age horror films of the 1970's. But a film cannot function on awesome sideburns and big collars alone; it's the old school camera mechanics, the flat but functional dialogue, the title card slowly rising from the bottom of the screen that make this throwback so refreshingly entertaining. It's the kind of format I could sit through time and time again with little more than a shuffle of the supernatural elements at play to keep me happy and coming back for more. If this isn't a franchise in the making, I don't know what is.",1375747200,3,2984,4.710727969348659
5406253,4,B00AAA62TI,"This movie is about the Perron family, which includes a mother, father and five daughters, who move into their new home in Harrisville, Rhode Island and start to have strange encounters with ghosts.

Upon research, they discovered that 8 generations of a family had inhabited their farmhouse and more than 2 dozen family members had died there - some of the deaths were a result of suicide.
Unable to ignore the ghosts who start having direct contact with the family members, Mrs. Perron traces down paranormal researchers, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to try make sense of their bizarre living conditions.

The Conjuring is a pretty typical ghost/exorcist story. One thing that stands out about the Conjuring is that its based on real life events. While watching the movie, there were many parts that were really scary. I heard many gasps and screams in the movie theatre audience It's worth it to watch The Conjuring atleast once!

If this movie had come out in the 80's it could easily stand as one of the great horror fims in a generation, Problem is it comes out 30 some years later and everything in this movie is old news. I completely agree that you can take 3-4 other Horror movies and throw them in a blender and you get ""The Conjuring""...

With that all said, Im only being so harsh on this film becouse everyone and there brother is saying its the greatest horror film of a generation...

5406259,5,B00AAA62TI,"What better way to do this than to give my thoughts on a horror movie that is being hailed as terrifying and a true scare. Here is my take on The Conjuring.
I have seen my fair share of horror movies; but the only one in recent memory that i actually consider to be scary is Sinister. However for the next few nights, i will be sleeping with a bible close to my bed. SERIOUSLY. For a movie of its genre, The Conjuring is VERY creepy and while it may not scare some of you right away, the thought of this movie increases its scare factor tremendously.
The Conjuring stars a relatively well-rounded cast that consists of: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston, Joey King and the adorable Mackenzie Foy(who played Renesmee in Breaking Dawn Pt. 2). Without giving away the character names or any major details on the characters, I gotta say this: This movie has some REALLY good acting. The moments where these actors are scared; you feel scared right along with them.

I will not say if i do or don't believe in demonic possession, but I have to say............The Conjuring makes you not want to say you don't believe in it. The Conjuring is set in the 1970s, and is based upon demonic possession.
To describe it, its like The Exorcism(which scared some, some it didnt), the ex tv show Ghost Whisperer, and the movie Paranormal Activity (with a relatively higher IQ) all in one. And while there there a lot of unusual and admittedly scary occurences in The Conjuring, I will also say this movie does involve a doll; and unlike Charles Lee Ray ""chucky""....... this doll literally looks like it went to the very pits of hell and had a good time.

I will be buying this movie when it releases on dvd, and even though I am skeptical about the rumored sequel, I rate this movie:

9/10

The best haunted house movie since ""The Others, but wait, that's not quite fair, because this movie also is one of the best possession films I can remember since ""The Exorcist!"" Tense, sharp as a guillotine sliding down it's track to sever your head! Creepy as feeling something bump against your leg in dark muddy water. ""The Conjuring is a relentless horror film!

Yes, it is true, you've seen a lot of these scenarios in other haunted house/possession movies, but ""The Conjuring"" turns all the old clichs inside out, spinning their heads 360 degrees, until they come falling off & landing in your brain, taking a bite out of your mind! This film works, because it is so literately directed, scripted, & filmed. The acting is top notch, as these characters make you feel their terror! The soundtrack & sound effects massage your fears like a clap of thunder in the middle of the night, jolting your senses with electricity! Yes, ""The Conjuring,"" along with ""World War Z,"" are the best horror films of the year, easily burying  the gore laden inferior remake to the "" Evil Dead."" Just like ""World War Z,"" ""The Conjuring"" knows that gore alone does not make the horror film. It knows the true highway to your fears is straight through the mind in a psychological barrage of dread & suspense! One clap from this film, is worth ten bloody mutilations from the new ""Evil Dead!"" Why the comparison? Because their both possession films, & if one of them are going to take possession of your fears, it's ""The Conjuring,"" possessing you long after you leave the theater, while ""The Evil Dead"" is a gore buffet, easily swallowed, digested, & passed through your system & flushed away. ""The Conjuring"" is a three course meal of horror, that will stick to your ribs, & if you believe in this sort a thing, ""The Conjuring"" based on a supposed true story, may just upset your stomach a tad too.

One more thing, if you loved this film, there is a great obscure film fom the 80's with Barbra Hershey, ""The Entity."" Also, supposedly based on true events. I dare you to watch these two back to back, on a dark stormy night!",1375574400,5,2141,4.611548556430447
5406261,3,B00AAA62TI,"When the whole line of movies started, Insidious, Paranormal Activity, and Saw. The producers and directors got together to do many films. Some of which the best include Sinister, Mama, The Possession, The Purge, and The Uninvited. This movie falls short of scares because the basic premise is explained at the very beginning of the film. Which really leaves no room for any sort of mystery, or surprises. The acting is excellent I must say, and the only reason it's rated R is for a few graphic scenes with vomit, slit wrists etc. And it involves children which is also touchy at times. It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just more of the same demonic possession, getting pulled out of bed by your feet, whispering voices type of film we've all become a custom to seeing. I always enjoy films from the makers of the original films, but this one just didn't do anything for me. I think Sinister and Mama are actually much better, and spookier than this. Even though I don't believe in any of it, or scare easily. I actually think what you don't see is much scarier, and loud thumps are much more terrifying. Seeing the lady from The Haunting was a pretty pleasant surprise, as was seeing Patrick Wilson from Insidious.

Actually i think the continuous innate screaming at the end of the movie was really what got people afraid in theaters. But it gave me a major headache. So much so that it became annoying, and i was like ok enough already!! So basically I just can't figure out the high ratings of an 86% from critics, and 87% from fans. I thought the other for mentioned movies deserved much higher ratings. Along with others I didn't mention. The only thing much different was the inclusion of the Salem Witch trials. Other than that it's just pretty basic. I also found the birds, exorcism, holy water and crosses to be pretty cliche'. But as I said it has enjoyable parts, but just don't buy into the hype all the critics and fans are raving about.

5406262,5,B00AAA62TI,"I can count on one hand the movies I'd consider good that I've seen recently in theaters. And I'd consider this one to be better than just good.

Here's a run down of the movie without spoiling anything: Carolyn and Roger Perron move into a Rhode Island home with their 5 daughters in 1971. First bruises appear out of no where, clocks stop, weird smells occur and everything quickly gets worse. As the situation progressively gets worse Carolyn attends a class where Ed and Lorraine Warren are teaching and explaining what they do and about the paranormal. Carolyn seeks their help and has them come to her home to see if they can rid her family and home of this dark presence. The Warrens discover this to be their most difficult and horrifying case.

The film is based on a true story which alone makes it that much more frightening. There's no gore, nudity, and honestly I can't remember any swearing either. So a film being rated R for purely the scare factor should peak your interest.

The acting was great. Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren, Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, and Lili Taylor as Carolyn Perron were the shining stars. The rest of the cast including the daughters all did great also.

Definitely worth seeing more than once. Go watch it!",1375488000,11,1253,4.63063063063063
5406263,5,B00AAA62TI,"Based on a true story, the film opens with an incident in which Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren explain the difference between ghosts and demonic possession, both being similar to owning cats. Ed has a room full of artifacts that would make ""Riley's Believe it or Not"" museum green with envy. Hey don't touch the monkey!

Meanwhile the Perron family has moved into a house in Harrisville, RI, in 1971 BF (before flashlights). They discover their basement door has been boarded over, because God knows spirits can't pass through wood. The Perron family has a pack of screaming daughters, just right for a horror flick.

Needless to say the plot and subplot come together with wonderfully horrific results. Like most films the creepiness builds to a climax. This particular film has some minor religious overtones to it as one would expect with an exorcism type production. Good film to watch in the dark. Take the kids. Zombie soundtrack.

5406265,3,B00AAA62TI,"""The Conjuring"" did scare me, but twenty minutes after I left the theater, I'd momentarily forgotten that I'd just seen it. While I was watching it I got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh. If you've seen 1963's ""The Haunting,"" 1973's ""The Exorcist"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" you've seen three much better films from which ""The Conjuring"" gets its bag of tricks.

Probably any clever film student could make something like this movie. We all know the basic ingredients: a large, old house in an isolated setting. The house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly. It's in New England. It's autumn: cold winds blow skittering dead leaves. An innocent family moves into the house. The family is generic, without too many details; they are All-American and the audience can identify with them. They do normal things like go to the beach and watch ""The Brady Bunch.""

Their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies. There are antique curios that look a bit menacing.

Suddenly, during a quiet night, a strange noise is heard. For some reason, no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting. Rather, they use weak flashlights or match flames.

An innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown. She moves slowly, slowly, slowly, down a dark hall to investigate the noise. The scene is very quiet, very long, and very repetitive. You know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual: a vision of a hanged person, the reflection of a ghost in a mirror, or something truly terrifying, an IRS man there to conduct an audit.

You know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing, the previously silent scene will burst with sudden, loud, and oppressive noise. The sudden vision and noise will startle you, and you will be scared. What you paid the ticket price for. Oh, and the family dog dies, birds act weird, and mom is bruising easily.

At first, of course, everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance. Everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural. Eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something. Just like in ""The Haunting,"" there are loud banging noises. Just as in ""The Uninvited,"" a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house, and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a not-so-bad mother. Just as in ""The Exorcist,"" there will be an exorcism.

So the team of experts is brought in. They speak some ancient language like Latin and possess arcane knowledge. I won't tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you, but I bet you can guess.

I'll just say that at one point, the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch. Satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools. Any sane person would immediately evacuate. At that point a paranormal investigator, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) says, ""Leaving the house won't help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you."" OH COME ON. Vera Farmiga may as well have said, ""You can't leave now because there's still forty-five minutes to go in the movie.""

Vera Farmiga is a scintillating actress. She electrifies every scene she is in. Patrick Wilson is perfect as her husband; they have great chemistry. The movie wastes them, though. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that Farmiga's human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it, and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic, rather than just another ""Boo!"" movie.

""The Excorsist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" are all scary but they are also deep. They present big themes. ""The Conjuring"" avoids big themes. One character tries to kill another, and it's the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl. The movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters.

""The Conjuring"" misrepresents evil and Catholicism. When the Warrens arrive at the haunted house, Lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist. Ed Warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house. In the exorcism scene, Latin is spoken. This isn't true spirituality; it's fetishism - the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power. They do not. Only God has power. I am a Catholic, I pray the rosary, and I believe in Satan. The force that defies Satan is not an object, a rosary, it is rather faith in God.

5406266,1,B00AAA62TI,"Ed and Lorraine Warren have a long-standing reputation of being paranormal researchers. Their reports inspired The Amityville Horror back in 1976. That story was debunked, and the Warrens ended up being exposed as frauds. But that didn't matter - they kept going and making up other stories, which were also disproved. But there are still a lot of gullible people that want to believe Hollywood has discovered scary truths that no scientist or news organization ever found, so the movies keep coming.

The Conjuring is supposed to be based on one of their scariest cases, about the Perron family. The movie is ""based on a true story"" because the Perron family is real and they said their house was haunted. But that's it. Both the movie and the Perron family's story were proved to be completely false. More than that, the current owners of the real house are suing Warner Bros. and director James Wan, for making up a story that is bringing curious people to trespass on their property.

It makes sense that the movie is completely false, because it's also completely bad. There is an endless list of things wrong with this movie, but if you've seen it, here are nine of the sillier things to consider (of course, there are spoilers).

Nine Things About the Movie ""The Conjuring""

1. Nothing ever really happens. Nobody is killed, nobody is seriously injured. The dog is found dead in the yard, and a few birds hit the house, but that's it. Up until the last 20 minutes, the movie is all clapping, matches, banging, and yanking body parts. The only thing that makes the movie scary is the sound editing - which is awesome, I must admit.

2. The story doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's about Bathsheba, a witch in Salem that sacrificed her kid to Satan and cursed anyone that tried to take her land. Then, over the last few hundred years, Bathsheba's ghost would possess people that move onto her land and make them kill their kids. And now that the Perrons have moved into the house, Bathsheba targets them.

Umm, what? There were no actual Satanic witches in Salem, and ghosts don't possess people. And if the Perrons moved, then they would be off Bathsheba's land. Problem solved. Roll credits.

3. If all it takes to show evidence of ghosts and demons is a UV light, stoned college kids would have proven the existence of ghosts a long time ago.

4. Anyway, Bathsheba is a ghost protecting her land in the name of Satan or something. Carolyn actually thinks of the solution - just move. But not so fast. The Warrens tell Carolyn that moving won't help, because Bathsheba has attached itself to the family. Then the funniest quote of the movie happens. Ed says, ""Sometimes when you get haunted, its like stepping on gum. You take it with you.""

Yeah, because gum abuses you in your house at night, and you can't ever get rid of it.

But again, ummm... what? If Bathsheba is protecting her property, why would she leave it to follow a family? Then she would miss the next people to move into her house.

However, to prove the Warrens right, Bathsheba figures out where the Warrens live and goes to their house to threaten their daughter. Oh, and she can also apparently control the weather and make birds commit suicide.

5. If Bathsheba can control physical objects, why does she just squeeze and pull body parts? Speaking of which, when Bathsheba is dragging the girl around by the hair, and somebody chases her with scissors and cuts her hair so she can be free, why doesn't Bathsheba just grab more hair and keep pulling? How is that an escape?

6. Once the family figures out that weird and potentially dangerous things are going on, why doesn't anybody ever think about all sleeping in the same room? Why does everybody still go to their own bedrooms every night so they can get terrorized again, until the Warrens show up?

7. When Bathsheba finally decides to actually possess Carolyn, she doesn't do it at the house. She follows the family to a hotel, and then possesses Carolyn, so that she can drive the kids back to the house to kill them. Which just happens to give the Warrens enough time to also get back to the house.

8. When Possessed Carolyn is tied to the chair, and the exorcism really pisses Bathsheba off, what does she do? Kill Carolyn? Throw objects at the other characters? No, she turns the chair upside down so that Carolyn is sitting on the ceiling, until Ed tells her to stop it. That's all.

Again, I must say... umm, what?

9. The point is made over and over that the only thing that can save them is a Catholic exorcism. But when they do the exorcism, it doesn't work. God can't save Carolyn. Only her memories of a day at the beach can drive out the centuries-old satanic demon/witch/ghost.

The only thing that the movie is good for is a meta-game. Your goal is to count how many other horror movies are referenced or copied in this one, and how many times each movie is referenced or copied. Hint: it's a lot.

After watching the movie a second time, I have a suspicion that director James Wan and writers Chad and Carey Hayes used the movie to play a joke on people. You see, the term ""conjuring"" has two meanings. The first is to call up or command a spirit. The second definition is something that looks magic but is actually fake. Several times in the movie, the Warrens mention that a lot of people don't believe their stories. And remember, the girl kept getting her leg pulled. Literally.

Perhaps the movie was made bad on purpose, to make fun of people who believe this trash. It's a patchwork quilt of random parts taken from other movies with no thought given to the actual story. It was a cynical cash grab, and James Wan made the right bet. It was a monster hit that spawned a sequel based on another Warren case, the ""Enfield poltergeist""... which was also a hoax.",1375315200,32,5822,4.569097888675624
5406267,4,B00AAA62TI,"Horror movies are a dime a dozen and rarely rise above mediocre. ""The Conjuring"" not only rises above the fray, it places itself amongst the best horror films ever made.

Here's the scoop. The Perron Family moves to a new house in rural Rhode Island. They have five daughters and are on a budget. Small, odd things begin to happen in the house. They grow in size and frequency to the point the family knows something is seriously wrong. Much of the odd occurrences seem to center around their daughter Christine. They contact Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) to come and help them out. The Warrens show up, investigate and recommend to the Vatican to do an exorcism. But before that can happen things get so out of hand the warrens must perform the exorcism themselves.

This is one scary movie. The structure is classic. Things start slow. All is well as the family tries to reorient themselves with their new surroundings. Small stuff happens and is shrugged off. Said stuff escalates to the point it can no longer be ignored. Now things reach a fever pitch and all hell breaks loose. There are a few things that work here. First is the script. The family is at the center. You meet them. You like them. So when the doo-doo hits the fan you feel for them. You want them to make it out of this in one piece. Then there's the acting. The adults are all veterans and do outstanding jobs in their roles. It's nice seeing Lili Taylor in a high profile role. She's been more of a cult actress over the years. The kids also do a swell job. They feel like family but each has their own face so there is no confusing them. Then there's the direction. I saw James Wan's ""Saw"" and liked it well enough, but that didn't dig nearly as deep as this. He's really honing his craft. There are a few things that succumb to cliche and others that could easily be considered overwrought. There are also a few jumps scares, but they're magnificent jump scares. Overall though he's outdone himself.

My guess is (my hope is) this goes down as one of the all time great horror classics.",1375315200,3,2089,4.463350785340314
5406268,5,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring, was more than I expected. In the last few years, horror movies released were flops, not scary or full of a good story. The Conjuring is the best by far, a classic Family in Peril story, with a good amount of emotional characters, and very good developement of said characters. The scares are effective, but their mostly creep outs, which really works, there are a good amount of spooky noises, and even a few laughs. All in all, The Conjuring is an effective horror/thriller with a good story, believeable characters, with great creepiness throughout.",1375228800,3,566,4.90625
5406269,3,B00AAA62TI,"The media hype drew me to this film. My curiosity was piqued, and I entered the theater with exuberance and great expectation. I wanted to really like the film, but found myself merely liking it. The problem for me is too many parallels to other horror films of the past half century: The shrouded chair-bound body in the basement with a bare light bulb swinging overhead is classic Hitchcock, as are the scenes of birds flying pell mell into the side of the house, threatening the humans within. Electronic surveillance of supernatural activity in targeted rooms has been skillfully implemented in the recent films of Oren Peli. Loud, thundering pounding on doors and walls was the trademark of 1963's the Haunting. The theme of female demonic malevolence has most recently been well-realized by ""The Woman in Black"", portrayed by Liz White. And demonic possession itself, with a barfing, bruised, baleful female victim was filmed to chilling perfection forty years ago by Friedkin, based on Blatty's novel.

Director Wan has created a well-crafted synthesis of many of the best elements of paranormal possession films of the past fifty years. He is skillful in the timing of classic ""cardiac jump moments"", when a monster pops out from behind a door, in a mirror, or leaps from overhead. His camera angles are interesting and inventive, with some dizzying inverted moments.

The movie is worth seeing. Just don't be surprised if you have a nagging feeling you have seen much of this before, and don't yearn for too much creativity.",1375142400,7,1533,4.984375
5406270,5,B00AAA62TI,"There may be spoilers below.  I will try not to put them in.

Ok, my mom and I went to see this.  We kept hearing how scary it was and I was interested to see what made it so.  That being said.  I did not think this movie was scary at all.  I believe that is because it was not a movie that was made with the purpose if scaring you.  It was in fact made to show you the story of what happened to these people.  A husband and wife with 5 kids move into a new house.  Things start to happen.  You will find out the thing that holds the evil and why it is doing what it is doing.  As far as blood and guys go, I do not believe there was much of either.  There was blood at points.  But nothing like horror movies now a days.  With blood flying out of people heads and what not.  Everything in this movie had a purpose.  That is because it was real life.  I was glued to the screen.  It is all very interesting to imagine something so unexplainable happens.  People believe in things they can see and touch.  This thing is something else.  Something pure evil.  It is basically a modern day exorcist.  But unlike The Exorcist, it really does not show you much of the person or persons who are possessed.  You may see them for a bit, but the movie is really about a GROWING evil within a location towards a group of people.  You find out who and why and see the outcome.  If you are interested in the unexplained or paranormal stuff, I believe you will enjoy this movie.  I have already pre ordered it.",1375142400,3,1497,4.037671232876712

It doesn't get any better than that",1375142400,2,340,4.0
5406272,5,B00AAA62TI,This movie was one I went into with little expectations since most movies don't have that scare factor anymore but this movie really amazed me. It was definitely scary and I found myself having to hold my friend's hand during some parts because of the scare factor.

Lots of creepy, make you jump moments and a bit unpredictable at times. Well cast and not too many slow spots. I was a little disappointed about some of the business with the Warrens- for instance, if I recall correctly 'Annabelle' the doll actually physically attacked people according to one of their books, yet they stayed away from it in the movie. Also, I would have liked more of an explanation of just what happened to Lorraine to get the Warrens so rattled, past their vague explanation.

All in all an excellent movie for anyone interested in the Warrens or who are fans of good haunted house stories and worth the watch.",1374969600,5,759,4.421428571428572
5406276,5,B00AAA62TI,"Poltergeist (1982) meets The Exorcist (1973) in this modern horror classic that only fails to meet perfection because its predecessors already claimed the title by pioneering the scenes and atmosphere that form modern horror filmmaking dogma as we know it today.  But James Wan kicks up the competition and demonstrates his mastery of storytelling and character development in a genre that normally relies entirely on atmosphere and gore-slathered effects to fill seats.

Let's just start by saying that this wasn't just a great horror movie.  This was a solid film and a horror movie based on a true account of Ed and Lorraine Warren's case with the Perron family in the 1970s.  There were loads of scares and--while, yes, they were often ""jump scares""--the creepy tension-building on the approach was finely crafted.  You would know that ""something"" was about to happen and it was going to be scary, but it would still manage to catch you off guard, and you wouldn't feel that the scare was ""cheap.""  Already this film has rightly stepped away from the last several dozen theatrical horror releases by engaging viewers with more than just funny satirical demons and loud noises masquerading as scary things.

Director James Wan's (Insidious, Saw) film is consistent and smart, feeding viewers a steady and even diet of story and character development for both our haunted family and the paranormal investigators.  Instead of taking the first twenty minutes to introduce us to the characters and hope that we invest ourselves enough to care when their lives are threatened, Wan piece by piece reveals the nature of the Perron family, their house and the paranormalists who come to their aid.

Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lily Taylor) have just moved their five daughters into a secluded house in Rhode Island and, as we've come to expect in horror movies, all horror movie houses come with a dark past.  Upon realizing that their troubles eclipsed the simplicity of a sleepwalking daughter and the stress of adapting to a new home, the Perrons seek help from Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), two married paranormal researchers with an impressive rsum  when it comes to purging evil.

The big success in storytelling and direction here is that because Wan presented the Warrens to us in the opening scenes--to set the tone and show us how these paranormal investigators work--and fairly alternated between their college lecture circuit and the escalating situation in the Perron house before the two couples had met.  We weren't force fed some ghost hunters halfway through the movie (or later) who we are ""supposed to like.""  Instead, we've already met them and learned that they're not some spirit hunting hacks who ""hope"" to find ghosts and get evidence so they can be taken seriously.  They hope there ""aren't"" ghosts, they're not in it for the money or fame, and they just want to help people (with an understandably fearful reluctance) utilizing their strange gifts.

Score one for character development and great direction in a horror film, James Wan!

Following in the obvious footsteps of Poltergeist (1982) and The Exorcist (1973), we are met with some very familiar scenes.  However, I felt this was a respectful nod executed with a succinct sense of urgency rather than simply riding coattails and milking past horror axioms for all they're worth.  The Conjuring skips most of the ""are they just nuts"" skepticism that would normally dominate the first half of a movie like this and gets right to dealing with the problem in a surprisingly practical manner.  As a result, most horror moviegoers' maddening frustrations are avoided in this film; no one does anything dumb or too perfectly right, the characters develop to protect their own and don't turn into sudden superhero evil-slaying experts over night, they don't walk into any traps when they should've known better, there are no ridiculous ""Antichrist baby-Hell on Earth-chosen one-omen-gypsy curse-ancient relic-house built over sacred burial ground and angering the spirits"" reasons justifying the spirit or what it wants or why it chose them, and they even address why the Perron family doesn't leave the house and if it would make a difference at all if they did.  All of this is done with simple explanation and for good reasons.

Score for the writers!  By the way, the same writers (the Hayes brothers) will be doing the already announced sequel The Conjuring 2!!!  However I have not found anything indicating Wan's involvement.

As we slowly relax our muscles between creepy tension, scares, ""wait is there more?"" and then the next creepy tension, we wade through some shocking imagery, disturbing shots, a little bit of brief gross stuff (but nothing truly gastro-intestinally gruesome and gore-slathered as we find in Tucker and Dale vs Evil, The Cabin in the Woods, Drag Me to Hell or Evil Dead) and eerie sounds.  Then there's the perfect--PERFECT--atmosphere that Wan spins.  Only with this paramount atmosphere could a small child staring into her dark bedroom corner (as we view nothing but out of focus ""black"") be as terrifying as the most horrible monster leaping from behind a corner drooling all manner of evil yuck.

As most horror is rushed and features a slapped together story-and-victims-sandwich as a vehicle to shock us with cringing brutality, creature make-up and buckets of rubber guts, Wan demonstrates a mature and tactful restraint which, contrary to most horror filmmakers' training, is wildly successful and eclipses most horror of the last two decades!  Even Wan's shot transitions were thoughtfully discomforting and artistic.

The Conjuring is rated R rating but actually seems less scary and intense than Poltergeist (1982)--of course, Poltergeist was WAY scary and I'd keep the kids over 14 to watch it!  I mean, it is scary--very scary.  But the gore is by no means a highlight and I didn't even notice the profanity (whatever there was).  All I noticed was that I was never bored or ""waiting"" for something cool to happen.  I was immersed and loved every minute of this modern classic horror.",1374883200,2,6142,5.066534260178749
5406277,5,B00AAA62TI,"So Summer's almost over, a few Big Hollywood Productions Tanked at the Box office, and this little Gem came out on top a couple weeks ago. Made on a budget of under 50 million, not quite sure. Anyways James Wan knows horror! The movie itself is a nice throw back to the 70s horror. If you want a good old fashion movie with scares here and there definitely check this out. There were scenes that just made my palms sweaty and holding my breath at some points. The prologue, setting up the story of the Warrens and what they do; interviewing a couple of nursing students about their doll Annabelle.... OMG, those scenes were just so nerve jangling! I agree with some of the other reviewers this is probably Wan's best film to date. I did like Insidious too and Dead Silence. And Friday Sept 13th we get Insidious Chapter 2!!! This was the Best film of July 2013!",1374883200,2,861,4.421383647798742
5406278,4,B00AAA62TI,"So do we really need another ghost story movie?  Well, maybe if it is as good as this one.  Directed by James Wan who may be best known for ""Saw"" of torture porn fame, the film relies more on good old fashion suspense, tension and yes, some traditional movie scare tactics.  As they say, the story is based on true events.

This time paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are hired to help the Perron family who just purchased a fixer upper home in rural Rhode Island.  Roger (Ron Livingston) is a trucker and his wife, Carolyn (Lily Taylor) a stay at home mom with 5 daughters ranging from about 6 to 16.  Before they can even get settled they begin to hear things that go bump in the night.

As usual, the events start small.  Smells, rattling pipes, thumping, etc.  Over time, things get more serious including possession.  Wan, to his credit, eschews the gore for character development which includes not only the Perron family but the Warrens who are reluctantly drawn in.  What makes this ghost story more interesting is that it relies less on jump scares and more on constant tension.  The finale is as good an exorcism as there ever was, including the granddaddy of them all, ""The Exorcist.""  Nice performances by all involved helps make this a memorably frightening time at the movies.",1374796800,3,1338,4.690987124463519
5406279,5,B00AAA62TI,"The Conjuring is James Wan's best film to date. It's destined to be considered a classic in time. It doesn't rely on blood, sex/nudity or profanity to get a reaction out of you and truth be told, there isn't anything offensive in it.

And yet it was given an R rating. Why? The MPAA's explanation is that The Conjuring is just too scary. There's nothing you can cut from it that would change the frightening tone that would make it acceptable for kids to be able to easily see it. Frankly, I agree with the rating.

I'm a seasoned horror fan and it's not like I'm calling The Conjuring the be-all-end-all of scary films but it did creep me (a grown man/seasoned horror fan) the hell out and made me anxious as hell all throughout just based on creepy atmosphere, good acting, music, cinematography and the occasional scary but not offensive imagery.

The fact is, this movie would give most kids nightmares and while I think it's fine (and admittedly a little fun) to scare them, it's probably a good idea to have an adult there for some kind of comfort.

Excellent 70's style, complete with fashion, gritty and soft cinematography, interior design of the house and the famous 70's zooms.

The Conjuring, is in my opinion, destined to become a horror classic in like 10 years time once it's brushed off its ""'new horror movie"" reputation. This genuinely unsettling haunted house movie comes highly recommended!",1374710400,2,1410,4.715447154471545
5406280,5,B00AAA62TI,Just saw this movie last night. It's great seeing a suspense/horror movie that keeps everyone in the audience on the edge of their seats. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great leads. James Wan has established himself as one of the best directors in this type movie genre.  First Insidious and now The Conjuring.  A must see and buy for everyone who enjoys these type movies.  Hey - the soundtrack was good too!,1374710400,2,414,4.6438356164383565
5406281,4,B00AAA62TI,"Before I get started on this review, I want everyone to ignore that infamous little phrase that gets attached to films like this. You know which one I'm talking about: ""Based on a true story."" I could go on about the trustworthyness of the Warrens or the lack thereof, but the best thing to do with this film is to ignore all of that. If you go into this with the idea that the Warrens are shameless hucksters, then you'll miss out on enjoying all that this film has to offer. If you go into this thinking that every frame is true or trying to explain to someone how all of this could've happened, you'll suffer the same fate. Just enjoy this for what it is: one of the first mainstream horror films released to the theaters in the summer in a long while.

Now on to the proper review.

I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. Supposedly this did insanely well when they ran this through test screenings and I can see why. The Conjuring had a lot to offer and didn't try to fill its running time by checking off every box on the horror movie cliche checklist. There are some tried and true formats here to be sure, but they're fairly well executed. The movie makes use of a lot of jump scares, so if you're irritated by those I would probably wait until this hits the rental sites. They're all done in good fun and are for the most part genuinely spooky, although I'll say that the jump scares were far more effective in the beginning of the movie.

The acting was excellent in this and whomever thought to hire Lili Taylor should get a huge pat on the back. She's probably the strongest actor in this piece, second only to Vera Farmiga. The ladies genuinely rocked this movie fairly hard. The guys were good as well, but let's not pretend that they were there for anything other than to be played off the women.

Now as far as story goes, this was decent. It's actually a fairly simplistic story line when you get down to it. There wasn't a lot of gussying up of the subject matter, although there was somewhat of a side story that surrounded the Warrens' daughter, the demon, and a doll from the beginning of the movie. I do have to admit that I'm not sure what I felt about that part. The doll's acquisition was shown at the beginning of the movie and largely had nothing to do with what the Perrons went through, except for showing up in one scene. The scare surrounding this scene was decent, but I kind of feel that it was one of the two weakest scenes in the film. The other weakest scene? I hate to say it, but it was the showdown in the end. I liked it well enough and it was entertaining, but it also felt slightly anticlimactic. Most viewers won't feel let down by the scene, although my friends and I all agreed that although this was an incredibly strong horror movie, the ending did sort of leave a little to be desired in comparison with the rest of the film.

In the end though, the concerns are all fairly minor quibbles. This will still be an excellent film to go see in the theaters and something that I'd recommend for horror fans- especially those who love the older stuff. The director took great pains to make the opening and ending feel like something you'd have seen in the older days of horror, which I greatly appreciated. I'd say that this film is good enough to where it's something I'd outright own when it releases on DVD and assuming that the sequel will be as well done as this was, I'll be there on the opening weekend for whatever other movie they make.

On a side note, if you can, see this with a more full theater. I was lucky enough that my fellow theater goers were excellent companions to watch a movie with. They reacted at all the right times, which made everything in the movie that much more scary for myself and my friends.",1374451200,111,3771,4.334277620396601
5406282,5,B00AAA62TI,"Saw this movie the other day, had high hopes for it and boy did it not disappoint. Best horror movie I've ever seen. James Wan knows how to direct. Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious, and now his best work yet, the conjuring, can't wait to see Insidious 2.",1374451200,4,250,4.340425531914893
5406283,2,B00AAA62TI,"The movie starts off with footage from the 70's of these girls who say they thought they had a ghost, and invited her to live in a doll. But the Ghostbusters say it's not a ghost, it's a demon. The doll then gets put into warehouse 13. And now for something completely different. The Brady Bunch move into a haunted house and find a cellar that was boarded up. A demon tries to be a comedian by pulling peoples legs, and trying to convince some of the girls to enter a wardrobe, probably to take them to Narnia. The Ghostbusters are called in to investigate. They discover that the house once belonged to The Blair Witches sister and she has returned as a demon... *record scratching sound*... wait, didn't they say earlier that demons are not human, they are something else? PLOT HOLE... oh well, GAME ON... so the witch ghost is attached to the kids, she just wants to be friends by playing a game and giving the family the clap. Harmless enough ghost. Oh wait, she killed the dog... bad ghost. Now she wants to possess the mother. Sure, latch onto the kids, but take over the mother, makes sense. Better call for an exorcism before someone throws more balls around the basement and stops clocks from ticking. Uh, oh. You've ticked the wicked witch off, she's not only mad at the Brady Bunch, but she's going after the Ghostbusters daughter too. Better drop what you're doing and get over their before that doll from the start of the movie makes another appearance. Now that doll has been reintroduced to show the beginning of the movie was in someway connected to the rest of it, it's time to put the toys away and go back to the Amitiville house for a wet t-shirt contest of holy water and growling. Throw in a kid who is too stupid to find her way out of the bottom of the house, and then have the power of love be a curious thing, make one women weep, and the other one go back to hell.

So, best horror movie in years, ey? Pffft. I don't think so. More like typical horror movie of the last few years, take a dragged out boring first half, pick up speed and get interesting, and then have an ending that does not pay off well. Sniff, Sniff... what's that smell? Is it a fart? No it's the stench of movie makers expecting to make a sequel before they even know if anyone want's to even have a sequel. Perhaps the sequel will explain why so much sub story was put into wondermind woman's horror of a previous case, only to not pay off in the end. It's like they added that, and the doll, and the premonitions or visions as a last minute addition to just add something more to an otherwise pretty slow movie with not much happening most of the time.

Trust me, don't bother seeing it in theatres, nor hire it on whatever... just wait for TV and be thankful you didn't waste money on it. Real horror movie fans will see it the way I have, not just be in this fad at the moment for horror movies with half finished scripts that are completed by Twilight/Beiber fans for the finale.",1374451200,14,2983,4.334525939177102
5406284,5,B00AAA62TI,"This movie was actually very creepy and is the perfect haunted house/ghost story movie. It gave me chills, and made my date grab tight on my arm. It was very believable that it took place in the 1970's. Other movies that take place in the 70's tend to over-do that. When Carolyn and Roger Perron move into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island with their five daughters, they begin to have paranormal occurrences in the house from shadow people to clocks stopping to being pulled by a ghost. They hire Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. They soon must deal with the house and the possession of Carolyn. I would compare this film to the original 'Amityville Horror' If you want a great horror flick to actually scare you, I highly recommend THE CONJURING!!!",1374364800,4,768,4.696296296296296
5406285,2,B00AAA62TI,"And unfortunately they have NOTHING to say.  So disappointed in this one.  I was a huge fan of Wan's ""Insidious"" and ""Saw,"" but this was really just much ado about nothing.  After I left the viewing, I thought the film should be retitled ""The Warren's Love Story.""

The possibilities were endless, but the director and screenwriter couldn't seem to make up their minds what they wanted to do.  If you plan to scare me, you're going to have to come up with something more than a unseen whatever pulling someone's leg.  I asked myself about a billion times why the family did not get rid of the infamous dresser, but then I don't think it would have really mattered.  When the backstory finally came into focus--so to speak--the movie did pick up a little, but before that I thought the movie was (I'm sorry to say) just plain old boring.  I mean, all this paranormal ""stuff"" was happening and all the family could do was have blank stares and dumb looks.  The ""jump"" moments in the movie did not work because the way any particular scene was shot, you KNEW something was going to happen.  The side story about the Warrens was not interesting and did not make one iota of sense.  In fact, towards the end of the film, the movie was just all over the place.  Had the filmmakers made more of the movie as intense as the exorcism, they might have had something.

This movie is rated ""R""...for no apparent reason.  I counted one cuss word; there is no nudity, very little blood, and certainly no gore.  Perhaps before the year is over, someone will be able to conjure a REAL scary movie.",1374364800,14,1581,4.479020979020979
5406286,5,B00AAA62TI,"I absolutely loved this Movie, I have Been waiting for the longest time for someone to pick up where paranormal activity left off. Only in a much more realistic manner than Paranormal activity. And not only that, Its a true story about 2 things in one movie,the warrens, Ed and Loraine warren and the home that was haunted in Rhode Island. This was a realistic account of what Ed and Loraine Had ton Go Through In a Lot of their cases. Cant Wait for this Movie to come out on Dvd/Blueray. I hope they Make More Movies about the warrens case files, or a sequal to the conjuring.",1374364800,2,577,4.351851851851852
5406287,5,B00AAA62TI,"From time to time, it's nice to indulge in a good horror flick.  This is a genre that's seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years, but the evolution of horror movies themselves is an interesting story.  At one point, Frankenstein and Dracula were the scariest guys on the block, but eventually had to make room for zombies and werewolves.  Then, Alfred Hitchcock came along with his own set of foes, including The Birds and an innocent looking motel owner, named Norman Bates.  Psycho kick-started the ""slasher"" sub-genre, which eventually led to the creation of iconic villains, such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddie Krueger.  After a period of constant sequels and cheap knock-offs in the 1980s, slasher films turned into more a joke than anything else.  However, horror found new life in hits like Scream, The Blair Witch Project, and The Ring - which has evolved into the horror genre we see today.  Now, it's no longer about the bad guys trying to get the babysitter.  It's about the innocent families at home and the pesky evil spirits that are trying to ""get"" them.  Films like Paranormal Activity, Dark Skies, and Mama have fascinated audiences, so it's no surprise the newest horror/suspense film, The Conjuring, is also enjoying early success.

Directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious), The Conjuring tells the true story of the 1971 events at a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island.  Roger Perron (Ron Livingston), along with his wife, Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and their five daughters, recently moved into a new farmhouse.  Suddenly, strange events begin taking place at night, leading the family to contact a married couple that specializes in supernatural occurrences.  For years, Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), have dealt with mystical dark forces and believe they can assist the Perron family with riding the evil that has taken a grip on the innocent-looking farmhouse.  Mackenzie Foy, Joey King, Hayley McFarland, Shanley Caswell, and Kyla Deaver also star in supporting roles.

There's very little not to love about this film.  From beginning to end and from top to bottom, The Conjuring is one of the best horror flicks in quite some time - and the praise should go squarely to the masterful cast.  It's not uncommon for horror films to flourish without well-known star power, and The Conjuring is no exception.  Sure, there are plenty of recognizable faces in the film, but it's much more likely that you'll be wondering where you've seen them before instead of being able to recite their previous roles.  Regardless, the entire cast leaves little room for criticism, spreading the workload relatively evenly and often becoming so involved with their roles that occasionally you'll forget it's still a movie.  These relatively unknown players bring their A-game and provide for an absolutely superb viewing experience.

The Conjuring is actually based on real life events in which Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated a farmhouse.  In case you've never heard of the Warrens, they are most well-known for their involvement with the Lutz family during The Amityville Horror case in the mid-1970s.  Regardless, The Conjuring's plot feels like it could have easily been called The Exorcist, or at least a clever prequel in some way shape or form.  Although the plot of The Conjuring has very little in common with the plot of The Exorcist, it's hard not to mention the similar subject matters - especially since The Exorcist is regarded by many as one of the greatest horror films ever made.  Like The Exorcist, The Conjuring also plays heavily on the theme of good vs. evil and the vulnerability individuals create for themselves if they aren't overly religious - even though it's hard to imagine a religious family fending off the evil spirits in this film.

Going with the same theme as Evil Dead and Mama, the house is a creepy place to be at night.  Why not play off something so simply when it works so well?  The Conjuring does a marvelous job of using one specific setting to feast on the fears of viewers and it does so in such a clean, well-constructed manner.  The film appears to be such a low-maintenance production, but it works well, moving from room to room, and using every inch of the house to the film's advantage.  Each area is a pivotal location for the progression of the story, which obviously includes the basement.  It seems like such a played out place to have the most importance scenes of a horror flick. However, it sets the tone of the film from the moment the Perron family discovers it (yes, they had to discover the basement).

Speaking of pivotal pieces of the film, there are no more pivotal objects than the props themselves, which are of dire importance to the plot-line.  For instance, Ed Warren keeps an ""evil museum"" of sorts in which he stores items from each of his cases - one of which is a freighting doll that provides for an extremely creepy opening scene to the film.  Aside from the doll, a bizarre music box with a circus theme (and of course a clown is inside) and a mirror within creates a method for seeing one of the spirits within the house.  Either of these two props alone could easily keep someone that's easily spooked awake at night.

For reasons beyond comprehension, horror movies are a popular means of entertainment.  Not only are they popular, but they've provided some of the most unexpected hits in recent memory.  Obviously, moviegoers love to be scared, only without the consequences (which says a whole lot of bothersome things about society) - yet that doesn't change the fact that these movies provide for chilling and terrifying fun.  While the majority of horror films are either a major hit or a complete miss, The Conjuring absolutely earns high marks for its effort.  The film includes a great cast, well-rounded plot, and enough suspense to leave wear marks on the edge of your seat.  While this film is clearly only for a small target audience (teens, young adults, and horror fans), it will appease skeptics and be loved by horror buffs.  So, if you're even slightly interested in the horror/suspense genre, don't waste another moment - get to the theater!  There won't be a single moment in the entirety of this film that will leave you disappointed.  Enjoy.

5406288,5,B00AAA62TI,"""The Conjuring"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Based on a true story, this horrifying tale follows world renowned paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren who were called upon to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in a secluded farmhouse. Forced to confront a powerful demonic entity, the Warrens find themselves caught in the most terrifying case of their lives.

The cast led by Vera Farmiga (excellent as usual as Lorraine Warren), Patrick Wilson (solid as Ed Warren), Ron Livingston (also solid as Roger Perron) & Lili Taylor (also excellent as Carolyn Perron) is excellent. The directing by James Wan is excellent. The story & screenplay by Chad & Carey W. Hayes is excellent.

The music by Joseph Bishara (also plays the demon Bathsheba) is excellent. The cinematography by John R. Leonetti is excellent. The film editing by Kirk M. Morris is excellent. The casting by Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy is excellent. The production design by Julie Berghoff is excellent. The art direction by Geoffrey S. Grimsman is excellent. The set decoration by Sophie Neudorfer, set dressings by Kip Bartlett, set designs by John B. Josselyn is excellent. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is excellent. The make-up effects designed by Jerad Marantz is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Chris Bailey & supervised by David Beavis is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Ray McIntyre Jr. is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer & Norb Phillips is excellent.

This is an excellent, well-made, well-done and well-crafted supernatural horror-thriller that is entertaining, intriguing and interesting. It is also scary, as well. James Wan has possibly made, what is, his best film of his career, so far, and the best horror film of his career, as well. Vera Farmiga & Lili Taylor both give excellent performances and Patrick Wilson & Ron Livingston both also give solid performances, as well. This is one of the best films of the summer season and one of the best horror films of the year (actually the best horror film of the year, thus far) and of recent memory, as well.",1374278400,3,2117,5.0085227272727275
5406289,5,B00AAA62TI,"James Wan is a horror director that might have finally peaked with this one. His first SAW film was the best of the bunch and while Insidious had flaws, it also had some great scare moments and visuals. The Conjuring is a near perfect ghost/demonic possession movie. The scares are not cheap and they are 90% effective. A couple felt a little forced, but overall this is one the creepiest movies I have seen in theaters.

Based on a ""true story"" that takes place in 1971, a family becomes the victim of some evil forces in their new house. Two paranormal investigators are brought in to gather evidence. They are based on the famous couple that also investigated The Amityville Horror years later.

The acting is great all around from the kids and adults. I like how they didn't use any big name actors. Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are relatively well known, but thankfully no huge star power here to completely take you out of the film.

Very little gore, no foul language or nudity in a horror movie? Believe it or not, this thing earned the R rating for pure scares alone. Now don't get too overhyped or anything. I personally didn't jump in my seat or want to cover my eyes (though many scenes are quite chilling), but plenty of people around me did.

This is the first movie that has made me want to review it in a month. The Lone Ranger (2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars) and Pacific Rim (3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars) didn't surprise me enough to warrant my time reviewing them.

The Conjuring is my favorite film so far this year. Let's leave it at that.",1374278400,442,1570,4.4
8548978,3,B00AAA62TI,"AN ATHEIST PERSPECTIVE...
Obviously, I don't believe in Gods or Devils, Angels or Demons and What rubs me the wrong way is how the family is depicted as non church going folks like that makes them susceptible to such nonsense like demonic possession. WRONG!!! Just my two cents but believing in a God opens the door to believing in the Devil. I keep that door closed so I don't have to deal with either imaginary being.
That said, I thought the film was a typical GVE fantasy but had a realistic believability. Made to look somewhat amateurish in shooting not much frills and CGI. Good story. Good directing. Great acting!!!",1530316800,,624,4.681818181818182
