7071408,5,B00UUOV8D4,I sure hope the remaining 5 seasons of this series get released sometime soon. I guess the first 2 seasons (while waiting for the 3rd to be released) will have to do for now. In 2004 years ago a pair of episodes from the 8th season of this show were released by Sony Entertainment on a DVD inside a box of cereal. Ep 4 Four On The Floor & Ep 24 No More Parties - Almost. And boy were they fun to watch!! I'm glad that full season sets are coming out as this show is TV the way it should be shown.,1257984000,5,496,3.825242718446602
7071409,5,B00UUOV8D4,"I wrote a review which covers all of the seasons of this show.  They are great, and I can hardly wait for it to be available.

Thanks,

7071410,5,B00UUOV8D4,"Wow, talk about fast releases! I am not even finished viewing The Donna Reed Show's Second Season and Arts Alliance announced that Season Three will be available to purchase on December 1st,2009! In this Season 3, there are 38 episodes which will be featured on 4 discs with bonus material. With only 5 more seasons to follow, it looks like we'll have The Donna Reed Show's complete series faster than any series ever put on dvd. I just hope in all this speed that they keep the film quality as good as the first 2 seasons, as the quality is good, but not great. After seeing The Lucy Show's remastered quality that is almost pristine perfect, this show looks passably good, and I hope they keep it this way.

In this third season, daughter Mary is now 16 and learning to drive. Brother Jeff is now a teenager himself at age 13. Donna Stone starts to show a little ""woman's liberation"" when she wants to start her own business and teaches a Japanese Geisha wife how to become more American by not catering so much to her husband. There are great guest star appearances as well by Jay North as Dennis the Menace and poor Mr. Wilson, along with Tony Martin, Harvey Korman, Jack Albertson, George Sidney and more. It's another great season in the Stone family as you watch family life in America in 1960 and 1961!

7071427,5,B00UUOV8D4,"I grew up watching this show, and it's such a great example of what TV was in the 60's.  I would much rather watch something like this that was genuinely funny without poking fun at anyone or their beliefs than anything new that is on TV today.  People had respect for each other back then.  I never watch major network TV today.  I watch some cable channels, but I most enjoy watching TV shows that I enjoyed growing up and before TV got so raunchy!  The story lines were fantastic!",1400112000,,483,4.322222222222222

I love the show and the respect and dignity displayed in a real and loving way among the characters on the show; unlike today's t.v. families.  THESE are great! I can't wait to purchase the other seasons. Bonus features are worth the set alone, great current interviews, old stills from the production of the show; in color!!

7071443,5,B00UUOV8D4,"Wax nostalgic while you wonder where all those years went.

The Donna Reed Show was among the best of the family situation comedies produced in the 1950's and 60's.

Its gentle story lines, brought to life by able writers and a superior cast, continue to shine, even in the face of today's sometimes less than genteel television climate.

Donna Reed, and her real-world husband, Tony Owen, meant to invent an idyllic family that viewers would come to admire: a wholesome wife of grace, beauty, charm and wit that any good husband could easily adore; the dependably competent and always-agreeable husband who always backs her up; and, two children who manage to suffer gracefully all the usual trials and tribulations of growing up in a small town.

And, they succeeded.  The show aired some 275 episodes over a span of nine years, 1958 to 1966.  Each episode, without exception, is a gem.

By today's television standards, the show is a rose among thorns.

Each show in this DVD is faithful to its exact original airing, including its introduction and closing credits, absent only its original commercials. Cast interviews are also included.

The Donna Reed Show is charming.  If you can go back as far as the 1960's without rolling your eyes upward for the corny wholesomeness of it, it us well worth not only a look, but a coveted place on your media shelf.",1292025600,3,1359,4.793991416309013
7071444,5,B00UUOV8D4,This is an excellent family show.  For people interested in not having smut brought into their homes and having their intelligence offended this is great.  My daughter is 15 and wants all the seasons.,1279497600,4,200,4.852941176470588
7071445,5,B00UUOV8D4,"When is the donna reed show coming out i havn't seen it come out on dvd yet in 2010. i wonder if the fourth season is coming out in 2010 don't tell me going to stop coming out on dvd. i thought it was a good show and i was hoping it would sell good on dvd. i used to watch it when it was on american satelitte, nick at night i think. when i first watched when it came on i really enjoyed it. i'm waiting for her tv show to come out on dvd but if they're coming out on dvd it's no sense for me to buy them if they're not all coming out. not everyone buys them buys them over the internet they buy them in stores because they're cheaper. i'm a good fan of classic tv and i'm waiting for these shows to come out on dvd. So come on people tell them to get off their butts and bring out thses great shows on dvd. i'll be waiting for the fourth one to come out so don't take so long this time.",1275782400,,887,3.723404255319149
7071446,5,B00UUOV8D4,"In my opinion season 3 is by far the best. I have not seen this program in years and I had forgotten so many of these wonderful old shows. I can't deceide which I like best but the one that surprised me the most was the episode called, ""Donna Redecorates"". Jay North guest stars as Dennis the Menace and what a great treat this was. Hopefully someone will release Dennis the Menace on DVD. The sound and quality are excellent and each show brings back so many wonderful memories. The clothes, hairstyles and values are so beautiful that it really makes me what to go back to those simple times. I would recommend this set to any fan of classic TV. It is well worth the price and I hope season 4 comes along soon.",1268352000,3,712,4.281481481481482
7071447,5,B00UUOV8D4,"I bought the first season DVD for my daughter - age 39.  She and my granddaughter started watching the show together and they are hooked.  The following Christmas I purchased seasons two and three and they were estatic.  Last time I visited all three of us watched several episodes together.  The shows are filled with positive values and lessons to be learned.  No sex, no violence. Some will say this isn't reality, but I'm glad my granddaughter enjoys watching Donna Reed and learns positive life lessons and what can be wrong with that?
It was a great show when it first aired on TV and even better now when there is little else on television showing a clean-living family.",1265414400,10,677,4.65546218487395
7071448,5,B00UUOV8D4,"I think this DVD is great and is VERY enjoyable.  I rate it 5 stars.  I did want to mention, however, that some reviews are saying the opening and closing credits are complete and correct for season 3. I've only watched about 6 episodes so far, but 1 episode had the ""first season"" opening credits, another episode only had 10 seconds of closing credits (butchered by the way) with a ""Columbia Pictures Television"" logo at the end of it.  On some we don't see the ""Screen Gems"" logo at all.  So it isn't perfect like others think, but its a good job overall.  The Paul Petersen/Mary Owens interview is great.  Whoever produced that did a remarkable job.  Paul Petersen sings ""My Dad"" in it, cool!  This is really a great show, and the older I get, the more enjoyable it becomes!",1260489600,7,778,4.468085106382978
7071449,5,B00UUOV8D4,"SUPERB! EXCELLENT! I just recieved my DVD set of The Donna Reed Show Season 3 (1960-1961). The video and sound quality are simply amazing. A job very well done. Every episode is complete with the correct opening and closing sequences. A couple of the episodes actually have the original commercial bumper by sponsor Campbell's soup (""We will be back in a moment"" with the Campbell's soup helpers holding the sign. This is not the full 60 second commercial, it is the bumper at the half way mark of the show to let you know they will be right back - it's a nice original touch). There is also a 2009 interview with Paul Petersen on disc 4 which is not to be missed - he is a very interesting and articulate speaker and his memory of details of the cast and crew are very enjoyable to hear. Now, with season 3 here at last, I can hardly wait for season 4 to be released!",1260057600,5,868,4.298780487804878
7071450,5,B00UUOV8D4,"New Update for August 29, 2012: It was just recently announced on the ""We Love The Donna Reed Show"" page, that 'Season 5' of this great series will be coming out on December 4, 2012!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!! Can't Wait!!!!!!!! I can see a lot of holiday shopping bags being filled with gifts of 'Season 5' DVD Sets!!!! :-)

I had received in the mail the 'Third Season' regarding ""The Donna Reed Show"" on November 30, 2009. One day before the actual release date!

What a 'Grand Season' of Episodes you will discover in this 'Season 3' DVD Release! I enjoyed all the Guest Stars, including Actor Jay North from the ""Dennis the Menace"" TV Series, who was very close to making Donna Stone lose her temper, when he did indeed 'Guest Star' during this third season of ""The Donna Reed Show"" in playing his 'Famous Role' as ""Dennis Mitchell"" in the episode entitled, ""Donna Decorates"" which had originally aired on September 29, 1960. And Singer Tony Martin was 'Great' in the episode entitled, ""Tony Martin Visits."" I also liked the scene where the 'Stone Family' meets Lassie!-in the episode entitled, ""The Stones Go To Hollywood."" There are so very many Great Episodes on this 'Season Three Release' that it was truly a Fantastic Christmas Present!!!!!!!!!

All 38 Episodes concerning (The Donna Reed Show/Season 3) are Complete and Uncut!!!!! What a Relief!!!!!!!! I hate edited episodes from Vintage Classic Television Shows!!! And it appears to me that these season three episodes for the most part, do have a sharper picture resolution compared to the Previous Seasons 1 & 2.  Although, in a few episodes the contrast seems either a little too light or a little too dark, but mostly throughout these 38 episodes the contrast is fine!

The 'Rare Christmas Greeting' from the Cast Members of ""The Donna Reed Show"" is fun to see, with a very clear picture image, and a nice audio too!

Furthermore, the ""SPECIAL FEATURE"" with Paul Petersen and Donna Reed's (Real Life Daughter) 'Mary Owen' is quite interesting to watch, and is certainly not to be missed! There are amusing inserted scenes from ""The Donna Reed Show"" in between a 'Candid Discussion' of this TV Series, where Paul Petersen takes over after so many minutes into this very Cleverly Produced, and Fun Special Feature! It is close to a half hour in length!!

I JUST LOVE THIS- DONNA REED SHOW SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Special Update: GREAT NEWS: 'SEASON 4' regarding ""The Donna Reed Show"" will definitely be 'RELEASED' on DVD sometime in 2011!!!!! There is no exact 'Street Date' as yet, but it 'WILL' be Released! This is a very rare season release, since the ""Nick at Nite"" TV Network which had aired this wonderful family series for nine years, had only aired two episodes from this very elusive 'Fourth Season' of ""The Donna Reed Show"" and the episodes were ""A Rose is a Rose"" and ""Mouse at Play"" with the latter including guests stars Cloris Leachman and John Astin.

7071451,5,B00UUOV8D4,"This has to be the most physically attractive TV family in history, LOL. But what counts more is the acting, the story lines and the way little family problems were handled. Father Knows Best was out for four years before ABC did this one. That series was very good and I love it to this day, but it doesn't measure up to the Donna Reed Show. Jane Wyatt carried that series, but this series has all four major characters equally contributing to the excellent result. The only show possibly better in those days was Leave It To Beaver. A must have for vintage TV fans.",1258761600,4,567,4.40952380952381

8708438,4,B00UUOV8D4,"Let me say from the start that I do not own this set. I do, however, own sets 4 and 5 which MPI made. There seems to be a general consensus among commentators here, that the ""digitally remastered"" sets 1-3 are a reason to double dip and buy all over again. I almost got suckered into double-dipping for that reason. MPI claims they remastered, Virgil did not.

So I got out my set 3, a Virgil product and compared it to my MPI set 4. There is no difference in the picture quality I can tell, as both are quite good. Ironically enough on the first freeze frame I did to better compare, on the MPI I had come across a very large blotch of black, which ought to tell you if MPI digitally REMASTERED set 4, they did a quite lousy job, and in fact I would take the Virgil even without that, for a very slight edge, if any.",1513814400,,817,4.074534161490683
