2672594,3,B000JJR0QO,"This movie, although far from the quality we have come to expect is interesting in its own right.  It is worth an hour of your time and follows Gardiner's usual rhetoric.  Again the information was interesting and informative but slow at times.",1204070400,,244,4.785714285714286
2672595,3,B000JJR0QO,"""This is the story of a belief system that has been lost in the mists of time and can now be revealed again..."" The story begins in Avebury, England, where can be found an arrangement of large natural stones that look like the shape of a snake from above. Numerous ancient sites and symbols are used to examine the role of the serpent in history. Original music and music videos are included.",1201219200,,392,4.458333333333333
2672596,2,B000JJR0QO,"Though the information was intriguing the background music made it the worse DVD I have ever watched. Very very poor choice of music, disruptive to the point I did not want to watch anymore. Waste of money, any chance I can get my money back?",1200614400,8,242,4.4
2672597,1,B000JJR0QO,"Philip Gardiner is obviously an intelligent man with loads of knowledge on esoterics, cults and religions of the world.  Why he would produce such an annoying amateur production is as much of a mystery to me as these serpent cults.  He presents tons of similiarities between religious icons from Osiris to Krishna to Christ and Zoroaster.  Those similiarities are obvious to any thinking person and sophmoric as a foundation for this video.  Snakes are prehistoric animals which exist on almost every continent.  Of course there are snake and dragon myths in many cultures.  I'm tired of all this thin conjecture and emphasis on anthropamorphism.  What's with the idiotic soundtrack which goes from heavy metal to choir practice without rhyme or reason.  The sound quality is sub par, the visuals are pathetic.  My final comment THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSucks.",1190592000,11,856,5.281481481481482
2672598,1,B000JJR0QO,This DVD is a poor representation of stories. Baseseless and without any true substance. Apart from the content the quality of the picture is sub-standard.,1182384000,,155,5.24
2672599,1,B000JJR0QO,"This DVD was a huge disappointment and waste of money.  I wanted to rent it first, but could not find it anywhere.  I took a risk based on the reviews on this site.  The heavy metal that is on half of the DVD is irritating, loud, and hard to get past.  The visuals are superimposed one on top of another.  They also melt from one scene into another or are moving up or down the screen through out the majority of the documentary.  It is difficult to focus on any one scene before it is blended into the next overlay.  There may be some great scenes, but I feel like I never got a decent look at anything.  The information sounds like it would be interesting, if there were supporting sources behind it or explanation of how it was come to.  The commentary jumps from one place to another, as though it were an obvious, conclusive leap.

It would be difficult to get through this DVD for the music alone.  Perhaps his books are better.",1170633600,16,934,4.28
2672600,5,B000JJR0QO,"Man, if this guys books weren't good enough, he then goes and lands one of the most visually stimulating DVD's on the market right on our lap. This is full of beautiful imagery from around the world with music to make you cry, laugh and just jump for joy. Soul Path - the band - have done a remarkable job on the underscore and I have just popped and bought the accompanying album.

The depth of knowledge revealed by Gardiner on the ancient serpent cult and his revelations on the true bloodline (ha ha) are inspirational and I implore everybody to buy this and ABC to put it on the TV at prime time!",1163203200,5,601,4.271929824561403
2672601,5,B000JJR0QO,"""We are immortal -- once we know, and separate, good from evil!""

As an acclaimed independent scholar of mythology and the original Christian scriptures written by Gnostics, I was simply awe-struck to watch this audio-video masterpiece unfold as so many heretofore deeply-buried hidden truths were revealed to the viewer. I mean to say, it has taken 2-thousand years to grasp the significance of these genuine traditions, religions, and rituals of the ancients and then to get this mind-blowing, life-altering information past the self-proclaimed, orthodox, ""guardians of the truth,"" why it's almost too good to be true now! Yet wait until these revelations really do percolate to the top of the food-chain, they will certainly be branded, if not banned, once again as ""poisonous New Age propaganda"" in the same way that all truth seeks to set us free from those that seek to control us. Why? Is it because God is within us? Why is it that Jesus Christ, Michael the Archangel, or the Virgin Mary, for instance, are accepted as the ""personifications of the divine?"" Watch this DVD and learn why those in authority venomously rant and rave: ""They are a handful of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous dark delusions of the past."" Do we? Or are we seeking to remove the blinders from our inner eye that those in power still want to keep fastened tightly-shut, the mind's eye that Jesus told us to keep single to the glory of God! Yet the question remains as poet Christopher Fry asked us in his poem titled The Sleep of Prisoners, ""Will we wake, for pity's sake?"" Well, will you?

8150925,5,B000JJR0QO,I have enjoyed several of Philip Gardiner's videos.  This is no exception.  I am happy with the service and will order from these people again.,1525478400,,143,4.68

8150927,5,B000JJR0QO,"Mankind has been worshipping serpents for much longer than could be imagined.  The serpent is an obvious symbol of many things that humanity respects--power, cunning, sexuality.  Gardiner is an expert on the subject which makes this that much more interesting, because he is obviously so passionate about his field.",1374883200,,315,5.408163265306122
8150928,4,B000JJR0QO,"I'm no biblical scholar, but I know enough to realize the snake's importance in the scripture. This is an insightful and informative look into the snake's role, symbolism, etc. as utilized by the ancients. Quite good. They should show this in school.",1374883200,,250,4.976190476190476
8150929,1,B000JJR0QO,"I was extremely disappointed with this video.  I am an avid fan of mythology, ancient mysteries and archeology but your not going to find much of that in this video.  To put it bluntly the video contains lot's of blurred or photoshoped imaging, good vocals by Gardiner but short explainations of the subject matter ie the serpent societies and absolutely horrible thrash, death metal music which completely makes one forget what the narrator is saying.  Absolute waste of time if anyone is actually serious about learning the ancient mystery's and with the music being a polar opposite of the subject matter it's hard to glean any information nor retain anything Gardiner may be trying to convey.",1332720000,,696,4.982758620689655
8150930,1,B000JJR0QO,"There may be some good info somewhere in this video, but it is just very irritating to watch.  The constant double exposure and fading in and out between images makes it hard to concentrate on what the narrator is  trying to convey.  It is sort of like a project for film techniques class.  The soundtrack is great if you like punk, but does not exactly add to the experience.  If you want an art movie, buy it.  If you are looking for the secrets of the universe, buy a book.",1243382400,3,476,4.233333333333333
8150931,5,B000JJR0QO,It is truly amazing how serpents are represented in ancient symbols and structures. Serpents are woven into our history through Greek mythology and Christianity. I've never seen the serpent revealed in such a light.,1236124800,,215,5.352941176470588
8150932,1,B000JJR0QO,"I was really eager to see this video, and very interested in the subject matter.  But, the video editing makes me seasick, and ultimately, I had to turn it off.  Nearly every scene consists of two or more images that are superimposed, and swirling or moving in opposite directions.  All the other video effects are over-used, too; like someone who went crazy with Adobe Photoshop.  Too bad; I think that the author may have had some good content, but if he ever makes another video, he needs to get a competent and qualified editor to do the post-production work.",1231545600,5,563,4.656565656565657
8150933,3,B000JJR0QO,This DVD has some great information and shows some really weird old depictions of serpents and how they were a common fabric of life.  I was a little disappointed in the presentation overall but I it is still worth the view.,1209254400,,224,4.463414634146342
8150934,4,B000JJR0QO,"Rent this along with Gardiner's other films on secret societies, codes, etc....this is a ""must see.""  In this piece, Gardiner continues the conversation he starts on the serpent cults in Secret Societies.  He focuses on the Holy Grail and the Elixer of Life.  There are major links here that I never knew about.  Learn why so much of this information has remained hidden and how it can benefit us in contemporary society.",1206057600,,421,4.805555555555555
