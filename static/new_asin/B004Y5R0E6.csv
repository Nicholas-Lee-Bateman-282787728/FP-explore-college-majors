""Karen Cries On the Bus"" (2011 release from Colombia; 98 min.) opens as we see Karen (played by Angela Carrizosa) sitting on the bus, in tears. Karen arrives at a cheap boarding house where she rents a room, and it is only later that we find out she has just left her husband. Later on, Karen's mom arranges a 'reconciliation' meeting between the two of them and Karen temporarily returns to him, but not for long. Karen makes the acquaintance of Patricia, who also rents a room in the same boarding house. Meanwhile, Karen is desparate to land a job as she is almost out of money. Then one day, as she takes a coffee break in a local cafe, Karen's handbag is stolen, leaving her penniless, literally. What is she going to do now? At that point we are about half-way into the movie. Will Karen and her husband reconcile? Will Karen find a job? What will happen to Patricia? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out.

Couple of comments: kudos to writer-director Gabriel Rojas Vera for bringing this slice of life out of Colombian society. While the plot is of course important, this is as much a character study of a woman trying to gain her independence than it is a 'soap' about divorce. The tone of the movie is never melo-dramatic, but instead is restrained in the best of ways, hence feeling realistic. Kudos also to Angela Carrizosa in the title role, as she is front and center of this movie, in fact, as I'm thinking about it, she may very well be in every single frame of the movie. At one point Karen is having a discussion with a friend who asks ""so what do you do?"", and Karen, eager to avoid having to admit she's separated, simply says ""I'm repainting my life"". How true and what a touching moment. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Karen Cries On the Bus"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1372723200,3,2244,4.404819277108434
8447921,3,B004Y5R0E6,"The title of this film refers to the way in which its protagonist manipulates well-meaning strangers to provide her with money which she needs to survive given her relinquishment of a financially comfortable but ultimately deadening marriage to a shallow, self-absorbed man who cannot see Karen as a person in her own right to save his life. Beautifully photographed and well acted, Karen Cries On the Bus is a gritty, often disturbing examination of the profound difficulties generally encountered when a socially isolated individual possessing little native talent is precipitously thrust into society with no resources except the wile and determination to make it on her own whatever the cost. My problem with the film was that I often found Karen to be an unsympathetic character but that did not stop me from remaining absorbed by the film-making throughout. 3.5 stars.",1351036800,4,874,5.205673758865248
8447922,5,B004Y5R0E6,"As the title might suggest, Karen Cries on the Bus begins with it's title character sobbing on a bus. Her destination is the city of Bogota, Colombia, though she has little money and no job to support herself. It's soon learned that she is leaving her husband. This emotional opening sequence alone is enough to illustrate the trials of life and the difficult journeys we sometimes have to make.

The character of Karen (Anjela Carrizosa) could be anyone. She's portrayed as an average housewife, who we assume has been living a comfortable life with her successful husband. Like many of us, she has regrets about her life. Though unlike most people, Karen makes the drastic and life changing decision to leave her husband and try to find herself. This particular scenario doesn't just apply to marriage. It could be someone who decides to take a leap by quitting their job and starting a new one. Taking action to find oneself is scary and not without risk.

Karen takes on the challenge of starting a new life in the big city. At her new apartment Karen meets Patricia (Angelica Sanchez), a young hairdresser/party girl who could almost be the opposite of Karen. The two form a friendship which ultimately influences Karen to take more risks. Patricia could almost represent youth and adventure, something Karen likely has missed out a lot on.

The scenes of Karen in her apartment, a rotted and infested building, remind us about how bad some people have it. Once her money runs out, she's forced into the life of a beggar and small time thief. This is reality. How many times have you been approached by someone telling you they need money to get a bus or taxi? Do we ever stop and think about the story behind those individuals?

I choose to focus on these real life questions and situations because that is the idea behind Karen Cries on the Bus. It's not just about a woman seeking fulfillment and true love. While the film does indeed follow a woman and her pursuits to find independence, Karen could be seen as a symbol of any person facing the daily obstacles of life. Though because it is told through the eyes of a woman, this slice of life is definitely a welcomed testament of female empowerment.

Everything in the film feels organic. From the run-down apartment to the city streets to the people at the bus stop. The simplistic manner in which the film is shot is incredibly powerful and brings a true feeling of realism to the picture. The film also primarily relies on natural sounds. This is something I've always appreciated in movies as I feel that natural noise and silence often are much more effective than overly dramatic and pretentious music that distract from the true emotion of the scene.

The director's intent was to incorporate the whole city as a character in the film. This technique, when done right, certainly makes a film feel much more involving for the audience and I have to say that Gabriel Vera did about as good of a job as one can. Angela Carrizosa's acting made me wonder if she shares similar experiences as her character. The character of Karen also hit home with me in places as well. I related to her initial introversion and hesitation to step out of her comfort zone, and Carrizosa did a very applaudable job at portraying those small but important character traits.

Karen Cries on the Bus is a remarkable example of realism that not only tells the tale, but it puts the viewer right in the middle of it which in turn causes us to study our own lives and maybe even try walking through the shoes of another.
