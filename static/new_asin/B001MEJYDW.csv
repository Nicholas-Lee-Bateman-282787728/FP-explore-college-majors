3696393,5,B001MEJYDW,"I had the opportunity to catch this film at Austin's Fantastic Fest and was blown away. Not at all what you'd expect from a first-time director shooting on a limited budget and tight deadline. Polished, tight script. Solid acting. Great cinematography and superb production quality all around. Most importantly, this was just a blast to watch. I've already pre-ordered the DVD and am looking forward to watching it again.",1229040000,4,421,5.115942028985507
3696394,5,B001MEJYDW,"Directed by Ben Rock, the production designer on the ""Blair Witch Project"", I saw ""Alien Raiders"" on the last night of the HP Lovecraft Film Festival (Portland, Oregon), after a long night of carousing with the Darkest of the Hillside Thickets (an awesome Canadian punk rock band).

I have a tendency to doze off during some of the duller, more academic movies that play at the fest, but NOT THIS ONE. I was wide eyed the whole time, drawn through the story by some amazing writing, acting, action and direction that was very tight.

This is a low-budget movie, sure, but they squeezed every drop of excellence out of every dollar; nothing is wasted or superficial. When you need to see an effect, you got an effect. To me, this is way better than most big-budget movies that sacrifice story for excessive CG effects which turn the picture into a long demo reel for the CG effects houses. I want story and characters, damnit! In ""Alien Raiders"", I sure got it, in aces.

If you have played a Delta Green role-playing game scenario, or any modern day horror game, or like the more action-y parts of ""The X-files"", you will LOVE this.

This movie contains graphic violence, two scenes of torture (not as excessive as ""Saw""), gunplay, intense action and drama, and language.

Definitely worth picking up; this would a great series.

PLOT WITHOUT SPOILERS: A group of armed gunmen hold up a supermarket in the desert southwest, taking hostages. But these aren't normal robbers, and those aren't normal hostages. Yes, aliens are involved, as you can tell by the horrible title.",1228867200,6,1572,4.761029411764706
3696395,4,B001MEJYDW,"Despite the title, which suggests an extraterrestrial gun-and-gore ballet, Alien Raiders is a smart little film worthy of any DVD library with sci-fi and horror titles.

When a remote grocery store is taken over by armed gunmen, what ensues is not a robbery, but a search for aliens.  I enjoyed this at Fantastic Fest, where it sold out, and had enthusiastic audience response.

It doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience, and smartly teases with backstory references without revealing too much.  Do check it out.",1228521600,5,521,5.094117647058823

3696437,4,B001MEJYDW,"This film picks up as the story is already in motion for the characters which can be confusing to the viewers sometimes however in this pic it stays smooth and understandable. There is almost a subdued overture to the film due to the constant Christmas muzak in the background and lethargic profiles of several of the cast. Here is the set up: a group of renegade hunters take over a supermarket in a small town while tracking down an invading alien species. It almost seems like a generic robbery by the over-dramatic until they hit the store and the employees realize that something is off about the gunmen. The harsh cruelty of the assailants sends the remaining store workers into a  panic and fear becomes the emotional norm throughout this film.

The action and acting in this film was plausible and fluid between the actors as they battled wits back and forth over the cruelty and importance of the situation. The scenes were well thought of and seemed almost unrehearsed much like a one take scene set up. The action doesnt stop from moment to moment with blood and screams and back and forth between the alien hunters and hostage negotiators and aliens busting out of bodies and store personnel dropping like flies. The special effects on this film were thought out they actually put the money in the right place with using organic and true special fx such as blood guts and prosthetic and such instead of depending on CGI like a lot of small films do these days. I think that is why I like this movie so much. It will be timeless were as most of the CGI stuff always seems dated.",1431216000,,1589,4.571929824561403
3696438,5,B001MEJYDW,"Like most DVD covers, the illustration is misleading and the title incomprehensible.  This is more a taut little thriller than a sci-fi flick.  It owes a lot to John W. Campbell, Jr.'s novella ""Who Goes There?""  The point being, how do you expose someone who looks human but carries and alien inside?  In this version, they have people who can sense them.  The movie takes place at night, in a grocery store after it has closed.  A group of masked assailants/vigilantes enters the store and begins shooting customers, disregarding most in favor of those identified as being one of THEM.  When their ""spotter"" is shot and killed pandemonium breaks out.  They now have a force of police surrounding the building and they are trapped inside with one or more infected people capable of infecting them.  Now comes the hard part, who's who?  They have a unique method to determine who might be infected.  Ouch.

Tense and absorbing, the story is filled with suspense.  Loved the no nonsense approach.  This was a happy find.  Definitely a keeper.",1429833600,,1040,4.829545454545454

3696444,2,B001MEJYDW,"An alien parasite creature feature with alien infected, zombie-like creatures who chase people around a grocery store. Not much original in the film. Alien parasites that either reanimate dead corpses, or create ""zombified"" mutants has been done many times before, not too mention the fact that the whole ""zombie"" genre of films is getting so stale there is more mold on it than a zombie's rotting flesh! And yes, we have seen the whole ""creature in the grocery store"" before, but to better effect and chills - ""Mist"" and ""Splinters"" (convenience store) are but two examples. Even the scene where a captive's little finger grows back after being cut off looked remarkably like a similar scene from ""Species"" - right down to the way it grows back.

3696467,4,B001MEJYDW,"I have to agree with other reviewers. Alien Raiders is a lame title that hardly lends itself to what this movie is about. Now that we have that out of the way what about the movie itself? It's a different take on the alien invasion genre, and that's what makes this movie so unique and entertaining. Its not a perfect film, but it can't be denied that this movie will make you get into whats going on and keep you held through the conclusion. This is the kind of film making that you don't see so much from a direct to video production. It's worth checking out if you are into sci-fi thrillers with a taste of horror.

Alien Raiders is about a group of normal people who have become alien hunters. They narrow down their search to a small town grocery store and go in like psychopaths taking hostages. From here the story unfolds. The aliens they hunt take over human bodies, so figuring out which ones are humans and which are aliens can be tricky without help. That's essentially where the story gets you to. You have a set of hostages and the hunters have to figure out which ones are the aliens. The themes have that paranoid feel of movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Thing. The approach they take on this theme is what sets it apart. From the beginning of the film you don't know what's going on. As the story progresses you start to know a little more. The plot continues to feed you tiny nuggets of background story and plot progression. In the end you have one parts thriller, one part mystery, and one part horror film with all the speculation and wondering about who and what that makes this kind of film good.

The movie may not keep you at the edge of your seat, but it does keep you interested. I don't think Alien Raiders was made to be an intense thriller. More like an intellectual thriller that relishes keeping you interested in the little details. I do have to say that as the movie comes to it's conclusion that sense of mystery and thrill gets replaced with your standard monster fight and ultimately a disappointing and utterly predictable ending. I wasn't impressed with how they chose to wrap up the plot, but I did enjoy the ride.

This being a direct to video production the film budget isn't all that big, but they do a lot with the resources. You forget it's low budget (until the ending) because the story gets interesting and the way it's shot and the way the script flows will grab your attention. Make up effects and such are serviceable and actually work better than if they would have tried it with computer animated effects. The cast is diverse, which helps with the whole, ""who could be the alien?"" feel.

This DVD is not a bad package. The video is good and the sound is really dynamic during the scenes where that counts. The packaging is a little misleading as you don't get to see any spaceships or groups of crawly creatures anywhere om the film (I guess that fits the whole theme of having a title that doesn't represent the movie as well). The extras have some pretty neat items as well.

Hidden Terror: The Making of Alien Raiders - Your basic making of documentary. It's not one of those marketing fluff featurettes as it does have some real meat in the bone with explanations on the movie's origins and the methodology they went with in making it.

Blood, Sweat, and Fears: The special effects of Alien Raiders - A second documentary focusing on makeup and gore techniques. It is brief with not a lot of content.

Tape #9: Sterling Explains Alien - This is an interesting extra. It's done like those tapes found in the film and holds some neat details on the alien creatures. It goes through the origins of the creature as well as a sort of retrospective from the film. It's done like a scientific analysis which adds a little authenticity if not an exciting extra.

Tape #12: Spooky's Job - Goes into more details on the character Spooky and his ability to sense the aliens. If you had questions during the film about this guy this 'tape' does a lot to explain things.

Whitney Cam - A little Facebook/MySpace looking video of the character Whitney and her day to day musings of her normal life. Doesn't lend all that much to the whole package, but a little interesting nonetheless.

Alien Raiders is a neat concept that is well executed up until the final conflict of the film. While I hate that the film went for the cliched' and often traveled road in the end the majority of the content of the film makes up for it. Most sci-fi fans should find something to latch onto in this film, but it's mostly for those interested in body snatcher type films.",1383609600,2,4615,4.470308788598575
3696468,3,B001MEJYDW,"OK, this movie turned out to be quite a bit better than expected... somewhat predictable, but still definitely worth the watch.  I'd like to be able to rate it 3.5 stars.  It pretty much kept me on the edge of my seat... kept me watching... good acting, and I never got bored.  If you're into sci-fi / alien movies you should see this one... it won't disappoint you.",1382227200,,366,4.352941176470588
3696469,1,B001MEJYDW,"True. The title is a misnomer and the DVD cover is misleading. There is a creature, but we see very little of it. Humans possessed by it do a lot of screaming and running and hitting and biting. The possessed kill people, but we don't really see it, we just hear it as the killing occurs off-camera. Inexplicably the supermarket building shakes to its foundation while we hear a huge roar from the beast. Yikes, it even looks and sounds like an earthquake. If the creature is inside its host, where does the enormous roar come from? In the end we are able to see the creature but at a distance, and only very briefly. Very briefly. Very disappointing to notice that it is the size of a small dog (definitely larger than a Chihuahua) with the skin peeled off. We are never allowed to see its face, if it has one. And we notice too that outside of its host it really does not fight much. Inside the host, well, it's the human who does all the stalking inside the supermarket. Where did it come from and what does it want? It's never clear. Are there others? Don't know. About 98% of the movie takes place inside the supermarket. Boring. Outside there is no sense of city life besides the police cars parked in front of the supermarket. On the other hand, the acting was okay for the most part. If we take the lame creature out of the picture this would be a 3-star hostage movie. I hope to God they don't dare think of making a sequel to this AWFUL, low-budget disaster.",1377043200,,1468,4.341818181818182
3696470,3,B001MEJYDW,"It's not often that I actually lower a rating based on the ending but... this is one example where I feel I have to.  It's REALLY bad!  It ends too soon!!  At least 5 more minutes of action is needed to properly end all the alien chasing suspense and excitement on a satisfying note.  The way it just suddenly ends (without spoiling it) is just... meh.  Terrible.  Simply put, it's an incomplete ending.

Otherwise, the movie is pretty good.  A group of masked men that we initially believe are robbers break into a grocery store and begin shooting a select few people not because they're vicious/compassionless killers but because they believe one of the customers is disguising themselves as an alien.  So far, very promising.  The men take all the customers/victims to the back room and figure out which one is actually the alien.  Meanwhile the victims come up with ideas on how to escape.  This is totally enjoyable writing material.

Carlos Bernard, or Tony Almeida as I've grown to know him as, is the leader of the group and he's absolutely terrific as an actor.  I believe this is the first time I've seen him star in anything after his 24 days.  The pacing and acting is reminiscent of the TV show 24 as well however instead of Jack Bauer saving the day, it's pretty much Carlos Bernard and his group attempting to convince the cops outside the store there's a clear purpose in them being there.  Of course Carlos is smart and knows that mentioning an alien secretly roaming through a grocery store isn't going to win over the cops and make them believe a single word he says.  No siree, so Carlos is reluctant to mention this part.

Eventually, the alien is revealed!  Actually it's revealed in more ways than one, which is a surprise.  Again, I won't spoil what I mean by this.  Let's just say, there's more than one person who's an alien.

But... the ending.  While I suppose it's a little surprising which character ends up experiencing alien tendencies, it doesn't change the fact the movie should NOT have ended on *that* note.  Really awful writing there.  Otherwise, a quality movie.",1374192000,,2101,4.659400544959128
3696471,3,B001MEJYDW,"I'll start off by saying that this was actually a decent film. I'll also say that you're going to have to throw out your sense of logic to make it decent.

SEMI-SPOILER WARNING HERE: So as you can already tell just by reading the title of the movie, this has some aliens in it. The movie opens to an action packed ""robbery"" and here is where you must drop your brain off at the door. The motive of the robbers, terrorists, whatever.., is noble, but their method is rather poorly thought out. Not to ruin the movie or dig too deep into the plot, but quite a bit of the 'drama' that was forced into this movie by the writers could have been prevented by the captors stating what their intentions actually were. I'm not going to say what statement that is, but it is fairly obvious to anyone that watches this movie.

Some rather ridiculous scenarios occur throughout the film as well. The captors, police and hostages get quite a few ear-fulls and eye-fulls of some rather insane occurrences, yet they are still unwilling to accept these happenings and their reactions are rather unbelievable. As usual, the police seem to pull off some forehead slapping maneuvers as well. Such as unloading massive amounts of rounds into an ""innocent"" instead of:
#1. Their target
#2. The giant, rabid, beastlike individual who seems to be posing the biggest threat

The film itself? Frankly, I've seen alien movies from the 50's and 60's that were far more scarier and better produced than this.  There was obviously not much of a budget for the movie.  I think the premise was great and the story line had a lot of potential.  But, again, if the producers don't have the budget to pull it off, then it won't work, which was the case here.  They must have been allotted about a hundred bucks for make-up because the alien ""monster"" wasn't impressive at all (for the couple of split seconds you actually saw it).  I kept waiting patiently for things to pick-up and go to the next level but it just never happened.  I was expecting this to be something spectacular like ""The Mist"" or ""Splinter"" (a fine example of a well-produced straight-to-DVD Sci Fi movie) but ""Alien Raiders"" turned out to be a poorly written/produced disappointment. I'm giving this movie one star because of Rockmond's and Matthew's performances, which salvaged the movie from being a total disaster.

3696503,3,B001MEJYDW,"""Alien Raiders"" (2008) is generally regarded as a really good sci-fi flick, despite being low-budget (shot in 15 days in Inglewood, CA).

THE PLOT: A mysterious team of armed individuals invade a supermarket at closing time. It soon becomes clear that they're not after money or goods, but something sinister and unearthly!

The director, Ben Rock, said he was mostly inspired by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing (Collector's Edition)</a>."" The best way to describe the film is to say that it's a combination of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hidden/dp/0780628586/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hidden</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist/dp/B0010X745K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist</a>,"" but not as good as either. This isn't to say that it's not worth checking out, as long as you're a fan of the genre; it's just that those two films are better, particularly ""The Mist.""

""The Hidden,"" while far from a great film, works better simply because it's less one-dimensional and confined. ""Alien Raiders"" begins and ends in the supermarket, that's it. Despite this, ""Alien Raiders"" is put together well, has an effective cast, a realistic vibe, and drums up some decent suspense.

Carlos Bernard and the beautiful Courtney Ford stand out in the cast, but all the main actors are effective.

Unfortunately, the one-dimensional setting works against the film. ""The Mist"" had the same problem, but was able to overcome because the long supermarket sequence is bookended by a prologue and, especially, a truly spectacular climax (the entire sequence after the group leaves the market). This wouldn't have been a problem for ""Alien Raiders"" if it was a one-hour TV show, but at 85 minutes the story drags in the middle and loses the captivating power of the opening.

It also lacks the depth of ""The Mist"" (if you don't think that film has depth, read my review). Like ""The Hidden,"" ""Alien Raiders"" is just a straightforward movie about some kind of covert alien invasion.

Yet maybe there's some depth: I was able to draw an interesting parallel between the infected people in the film to demon-possessed people, particularly in the Old Testament period where there was no hope of deliverance except to kill the individual.

FINAL WORD: This is a decent low-budget sci-fi film with a good cast, good acting and some real suspense here and there, but it's simply not as good as the movies it's compared to - ""The Hidden,"" ""The Mist"" and ""The Thing."" The setting's too limited and the film doesn't contain enough positive elements to grant it anything above 3 Stars.

3696504,5,B001MEJYDW,"As my title for this review infers, the story is a very plausible one but the way it's told is not. I wish to give no spoilers here. That said, with regard to the alien, it makes me all too aware that senseless violence and conflict has to be included in order to enhance movies for today's audience. Given today's mindset of society and the known tools available, I'm sure this ""raid"" (IF .. it were to actually happen) would proceed in a very different light.

3696574,4,B001MEJYDW,"A group of armed men and women take over a grocery store in a small town in Arizona. At first it looks like a robbery but as they gather the employees and customers they are looked at by one member of their group and shot on sight on his say so. One of the customers turns out to be a local cop who manages to call the robbery in and start shooting bad guys. When the dust settles the store is surrounded by police. The ""robbers"" gather all of the remaining employees and customers in a backroom. Slowly their actual purpose for being there emerges, as does their back story as the police investigate outside.

I was pleasantly surprised by Alien Raiders. I bought it for $2 at a Blockbuster going out of business sale and didn't expect much from it. Low budget and made by a small studio is usually a recipe for bad acting, writing and story telling. But the Alien Raider story, while borrowing ideas from sci-fi that went before it, told its story in an imaginative way. The writing and acting were also a notch above what I expected and it was nice to see Carlos Bernard, one of my favorites from the TV series 24. With a small budget there weren't a lot of special effects, mostly some heavy make-up. The title is a bad one, but the movie was good.",1338163200,,1252,4.305084745762712

I glanced at the four out of five stars rating and the total of forty-four user reviews and thought ""okay, what is this?""  After reading a few reviews I decided I'd give it a shot, especially since it has actors from three shows I enjoyed: Dexter, 24, and Prison Break.  I did enjoy this movie, the team behind it did an excellent job casting.  These actors helped create a good aura of suspense throughout the film and it's refreshing when that happens in a horror/sci-fi movie.  I wouldn't classify this as a 100% sci-fi film or horror either so it's somewhere in the middle.  If you're into this kind of stuff and don't mind much a back story then this is a good movie to check out.  It's worth the three bucks for sure.

It's not without it's failings though.  The characters are rather one dimensional, not really even switching tone throughout the film or exposing any other side of themselves.  Also, although I personally don't mind the back story missing, some might and understandably so.  You won't find out what happened before all this mayhem breaks out and the opening is very ambiguous.  This isn't a problem I suppose, but it does add to the feeling of not really knowing what's going on throughout the majority of the film.  But, maybe that's the point.  We may be supposed to left to wonder what has happened to cause all of this, perhaps there is a sequel in store.

In the end, everything works out pretty well, the cast does their part, and we end up with a good little hour and a half entertainer that is better than a lot of sci-fi/horror junk out there.

A terrorist group seizes hostages in a small grocery store, claiming to be hunting humans hosting alien lifeforms. This is an excellent example of a low-budget, high production value release that is able to effectively build suspense with minimal on screen violence and gore. The familiar grocery setting becomes a dark and foreboding prison using clever lighting and framing techniques. The film feels claustrophobic and confined, but at the same time it takes full advantage of every inch of the store to provide new and interesting shots within the single location. Each of the actors provide solid performances, and despite its title, the film never trips into the pitfalls of most SciFi Channel originals of the same theme and budget. The FX also stand up to any major studio release, and the scares never feel forced. The film draws heavily from THE THING and other inspirations within the genre, but still has many original offerings and comes recommended!

Well 2 minutes, that's all it took. I could not turn it off. I had to watch every wonderfully written minute of this movie.

3696663,4,B001MEJYDW,"Alien Raiders (2008) is a tense, gripping, darkly atmospheric, science fiction thriller, where the action gets off to a fast start.  Violence suddenly erupts in a supermarket in Buck Lake, Arizona, when a group wearing masks, and armed with guns, enter the store looking for someone, or something.  As the story unfolds, the reasons for what is happening are revealed gradually, as the story unfolds.  Spoilers are ahead, so proceed at your own discretion.

Carlos Bernard (24) is Aaron Ritter, the leader of the group that is seeking to identify and exterminate, any carriers infected by an alien creature.  Infected humans appear to be normal, so the group uses a 'spotter' who has the ability to detect the alien's presence.  Anyone detected is shot immediately, however when the spotter is killed, the group is forced to resort to other means to indentify who may by infected.

With the police outside, the group releases those found 'alien free', and barricade themselves inside the mid-sized market.  Six customers and store staff remain to be tested for alien infestation.  The police are led by former hostage negotiator Seth Steadman (Mathew St. Patrick), who's stepdaughter Whitney (Samantha Streets) is one the hostages.  Ritter is an ex-employee of Jet Propulsion Labs (JPL).  JPL employees, including Ritter's wife, were among the first victims of the alien, brought to Earth by an extra-terrestrial source.

Ritter's group includes Sherry Sterling (Courtney Ford), who conducts tests and analyzes tissues, while Kane (Rockman Dunbar) and Logan (Tom Kiesche) keep watch over the prisoners.  The test is grisly, but it produces results, as an alien is uncovered, and violently tries to escape.  The prisoners make an attempt at freedom, but another alien makes an unexpected appearance, and hell begins to break loose in the market.  Steadman enters the market with a replacement spotter (Bonita Friedericy), hoping to rescue his daughter.  In dealing with the alien, Ritter and Sterling both do what they have to do, while the inept police mostly stand around watching.

At a certain level, Alien Raiders works as a fairly effective and suspenseful thriller.  The writing is solid, and the alien backstory seems to hold up, although the creature bears some resemblance to the Alien facesitter, and bursts out of the chest in similar manner.  The acting by most of the cast is pretty good, particularly by Joel McCrary as the store manager, and Bonita Friedericy.  Ritter is kind of reminiscent of Tony Almeida from 24, wielding a gun, and giving commands in a low whisper.  Courtney Ford is very cool customer, with some striking eyes.

Under a little critical scrutiny however, cracks in the film do appear.  The scale way off.  The market is not that big, but there seems to be an unrealistic number of back of the house spaces, featured in the film.  The store is so small, yet it takes so long for people to move from place to place.  In this confined space, the alien is somehow able to remain hidden, pop out, and then instantly disappear.  The lights are turned off so the police can't see what is happening inside, but if they were turned back on, it would be much easier to hunt down the alien.  While Ritter and his group start out ruthlessly slaughtering carriers, they later become a little too complacent about dealing with potential aliens, and this lack of vigilance ends up costing them.

Still, if you don't dwell too much on its faults, director Ben Rock's film is a fun time, sort of reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982).  In the mostly dark settings, the special effects are quite effective, and a nice set of extra features adds to the flavor of the whole package, with in-character clips featuring Sterling and Whitney.

3696686,4,B001MEJYDW,"Alien Raiders / B001MEJYDW

*Spoilers*

I went into Alien Raiders expecting to make fun of it, MST3K-style. It was rated incredibly low on Blockbuster, where movies are generally over-rated in my opinion, and it was low-budget enough to have completely flown under my radar when it first came out. Nevertheless, I figured I like aliens, I like Hastings, and I like B-movies, and ""Alien Raiders"" was welcomed into the house.

To my genuine surprise, this is a really very decent movie. The action starts quickly, with the raiders taking over the supermarket in what seems like an over-powered midnight heist gone very bad. When the raider named 'Spooky', however, starts grabbing people's heads and declaring whether they are infected or not - and therefore whether they should live or die - we were instantly hooked. The apparent craziness on display is palatably real and even though we *knew* aliens would make an appearance in this film, it was hard to not place oneself in the mindset of the store shoppers and employees, desperately terrified of these apparent psychotics with guns.

There is so much to like about ""Alien Raiders"". The action is slow-paced - this is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie, per se - but I like the build-up. The monster and effects budget was low, resulting in very few clear shots of the aliens, but I frighten easily and therefore this was not a minus in my book. The written dialogue is absolutely superb, with several genuinely funny bits - we've been quoting ""Manny the Man"" since we first saw the movie last week. Perhaps best of all, the characters seem like real people and genuinely react realistically to the insanity of the situation around them, with several of them just going into a realistically calm shock, rather than the more usual movie technique of having them hop around and hyperventilate noisily.

I think a potential complaint for some viewers could be that the viewer is given extremely little in the way of exposition, explanation, or backstory, but I *like* that - I've become so bored with the tedious and near-mandatory ""five years ago..."" backstory/flashback that it's nice to just sit back and view things from an outsider's point of view. It's a tricky thing to pull off, but ""Alien Raiders"" does the job nicely.

The movie isn't perfect, of course. Some of the characters behave stupidly, although not as many as you might expect in a suspense/horror movie. It seems kind of noble-yet-stupid in retrospect that the raiders didn't just blow up the mini-mart rather than picking off the aliens one-by-one, given how incredibly difficult to kill they are when cornered. It also seems terribly convenient that the aliens won't venture outside when they're visibly poking out of their host bodies. And, of course, the shocking twist ending is about as predictable as the sun rising in the morning. Still, I recommend ""Alien Raiders"" as a fun way to pass an evening.

3696687,4,B001MEJYDW,"I am not normally a fan of modern horror movies, perferring the more genteel gothic style of the classic Universal black & whites. That said, this little gem was quite a pleasant surprise.

The film borrows from a variety of past genre successes, but that's always to be expected in a direct-to-video relase. where this film succeeds is in it's very tight direction and uniformly excellent performances from a cast of virtual unknowns.

I was able to guess the film's final twist, but there were several little flip-flops all through the movie, most of which took me by surprise. And I love the way the film never quite spells everything out. As a viewer, you need to fill in some of the backstory for yourself, just as the hostages inside the grocery store do. The concepts of good guy/bad guy get stood on their head throughout the film with your sympathies shifting with each new twist.

The bonus features are nice and reveal a ""Blair With Project"" style approach to the making of this film. Not surprising as director Ben Rock was Production Designer on that fabled film.

The gore should be enough to please those that like that sort of thing, but they never go over the top and are highly motivated by the plotline. As I said, I am not a gore fan by any stretch of the imagination and I was not put off by the occasionally grisly goings on.

Highly recommended!",1247961600,,1368,4.56734693877551
3696688,5,B001MEJYDW,"ALIEN RAIDERS

This is a really good independent flick that has a cool story line mixed with some good acting. This may not be an Academy award winning film but it is a cool flick full of blood and some great visuals. This is one of the better sci fi films I have seen in a while, and know I don't mean the Sci Fi Channel. After buying this one I kinda held off for a while always skipping over it for other titles, until my brother spotted this. After he said ""let's watch this one tonight"" I agreed and in it went, I should have watched this much sooner.

It is just a normal night for the employees and customers at the Hastings supermarket in Arizona, that is until a bunch of gun wielding maniacs take over the store. They begin shooting and picking random customers off one after the other, or is it random. Turns out that some of the people there are not what they seem to be and are hiding a deadly secret about their identities. Turns out that some of these people are alien like creatures that these hunters had a hand in releasing out on the public, oh well. It helps that there is a person who can see these things, until a cop in the store blasts him away. Now they are forced to hold every one hostage and find out who is who or should I say who is what the old fashioned way. If you are wondering what that is all I can say is it involves cutting off fingers and a lot of blood. But as time goes on the police build out side and something mean, big, and nasty is loose in the store, sounds like another Friday night.

I found this film to be very interesting and insanely entertaining because the characters and story were very fun. Also the hunters past is discussed and does not leave you wondering how they came to have this job. Add in the fact that the writing is sharp especially for this type of film and the acting is very well done and you get a cool independent flick. I would recommend this film to any one who enjoys having a good time, this movie is perfect for a weekend flick.

Director Ben Rock keeps things moving at an excellent pace and is not afraid to keep things lively, very well done sir I commend you. And of course writers Julia Fair and David Simkins did an excellent job on this film with some smart dialogue and a very interesting story. Of course like I said earlier the acting is good as well like Rockmond Dunbar {THE FAMILY THAT PREYS] and the rest of the cast, excellent job done by all. This is a fun film that I think is well worth a purchase so you should skip the rental, buy this now.",1246147200,2,2538,4.1629327902240325
3696689,5,B001MEJYDW,Like others I must admit I was a little skeptical about the movie just with the title.  But I like horror movies of all sorts.  Even the B-movies are fun to me.  This however didn't seem like a Saturday Sci-Fi Channel all day thriller.  It had a solid story and all of the unknown actors and actresses played their parts well.  As soon as the movie starts you are thrown right into the action and story.  Then it just keeps on pumping all the way through.  This one is definitely a movie for all of you fellow horror fans out there.  You have to check this flick out.  It is a must see.,1240099200,2,586,4.115044247787611

3696693,4,B001MEJYDW,"The titler should be shot, but the rest the production and cast did good. This deserves three and a half stars but I rounded up to four. This is one of the best B movie SciFi's I have seen in awhile. Almost like a cross between ""The Mist"" and ""Alien"" it doesn't seem like anything else I've seen, and I've seen a lot. A surprisingly professional look to the costumes, sets, and F/X. Good job casting, directing, and producing. What appears to be a mercenary group takes over a grocery store with several civilians inside. By the time the police arrive they have killed several people and we have pretty good idea as to why.

As the story unfolds we actually feel sympathy for those killing people and taking other measures to find their quarry. Afterall they have a pretty good reason and if the title hadn't given it away before the movie started you might have actually been in suspense for a little while. Hence why I think even I could have come up with a title that wouldn't sound so lame and give away to much. Overall a good SciFi that will give some of the A listers a run for their money. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.

I took a chance on this one and was rewarded with a film that manages to combine just about everything in the genre and explain it all at the same time. The film is fast paced, the special effects are good and you don't have someone telling you what has happened. You pick it up in bits and pieces and put them together. A bunch of robbers hit a supermarket and start picking off customers by having one of the robbers touch them. They happen to come in just as the detective of the local police department is leaving. The robbers don't want money and turn out not to be robbers after all. They are a group of self-made commandos looking for someone (or thing) in particular. That's it. I can't go any further without spoiling the film. It's an Independent Film with a good cast and comes at a great price. Get it - You'll enjoy it.",1236816000,37,971,4.282608695652174
3696735,4,B001MEJYDW,"""Alien Raiders"" is a low-budget sci-fi/horror film that would have been right at home at a 1950's Saturday matinee.  The movie has a great opening.  At just after 11 P.M. on a typical evening at an Arizona supermarket, a group of masked, heavily armed intruders kill several employees and shoppers and hold the remainder hostage.  What we assume soon turns out to be just the opposite, however, as we learn that an alien infestation has been discovered and tracked to this store on this night.
 The film has no name stars, but that's par for the course with many genre films.  What matters more are the special effects and the originality of the script.  ""Alien Raiders"" is far better than most.  Working with a limited budget, director Ben Rock wisely keeps glimpses of the creatures brief and deeply shadowed.  He builds tension and provides some actual characterization along the way.  At a mere 85 minutes, the R-rated film moves quickly and seldom bogs down.  Viewers may notice similarities to Stephen King's ""The Mist,"" but ""Alien Raiders"" veers off into fresh territory.  Bonus extras include a making-of featurette and a behind-the-scenes look at the picture's special effects.",1235779200,,1186,5.0

This film really deserves theatrical release .. it is maybe the best made-for-dvd picture I've ever seen.  The film was shot during the writer's strike - so they were able to get A-list actors, lighting crew, special effects, camera men, etc.

It is a very tight, well produced movie.  I was captured by it right away, and stayed on the edge of my seat for the whole thing.  I highly recommend it.",1235520000,,588,4.4392523364485985
3696737,4,B001MEJYDW,"Pay no attention to the ridiculous title, this flick from Raw Feed is a pleasant surprise indeed for fans of the sci-fi/horror genre.  Alien Raiders starts off with a group of heavily armed people invading a local grocery store and taking hostages.  Soon enough, it becomes clear that this group isn't there to rob the place, but find the hosts of some evil aliens.  While Alien Raiders sounds like a run-of-the-mill, straight to DVD, D-movie flick that is probably best suited for rotation on the Sci-Fi Channel, it's actually better than you'd expect.  Everything from the acting, to the makeup effects, to the action sequences are so well done that you'll be surprised how much better Alien Raiders is than a majority of the sci-fi flicks that see theatrical releases.  While it is a little too darkly shot (especially towards the end), Alien Raiders is a surprisingly good sci-fi/horror flick that delivers the goods.  All in all, if this genre is your thing, you should definitely give Alien Raiders a try at the very least.",1235433600,2,1029,4.851428571428571
3696738,4,B001MEJYDW,"This is a perfect direct-to-video production.  It reminds me of the 90's, that glorious era where films and series of films were made specifically for video and late night cable consumption.  Direct to video replaced the double feature grindhouses and the drive-ins.  This has all the ear-marks of something Roger Corman would have produced in the 80's and 90's.  It's a stock pile of genre conventions--commandos taking charge, a small town, hidden aliens, not knowing who is a monster, down and dirty characters mixed with average Joe's.  This film borrows from some of the greatest films and books ever made, and like Francis Ford Coppola says, ""If you're going to steal, steal from the best.""

Well, a bunch of black-laden commando types(aliens, the puppet masters) invade and trap some average folks in a grocery store(the mist) on the search for a King Alien that is hiding in one of the shoppers(the thing, the hidden, invasion of the body snatchers, etc).  The story behind why it takes place in this location and the hows is long but not overly-complicated to anyone who is a veteran of B movies.  The characters are shaded if not fleshed out.  They are all archetypes and are all performed well.  There's only two unlikeable characters and at the end you don't really hate them.  There's even an honest love story thrown in--which is never a good thing to be in horror, honest or in love!

The effects are very good, but don't linger on the screen for too long.  The pace is quick and the violence comes in spurts.  The director, on a making of feature, states he wanted to make the goriest film of all time, but somehow he had to settle for more atmosphere and set-up.  This is a good thing.  Without relying on bloody special effects he made some cliche'd moments really work, and when he does finally rip with the red stuff it's more effective.  There's even a great 'test if they're an alien' scene that is similar to the one in Carpenter's The Thing that ends on a gruesome note.  But it's a note that one may be able to relate to on a primal level.  I know I did.

Don't expect brilliance.  Don't expect something totally original.  This is just ready to please, B movie, Action-horror at its best.  This could never play in the theaters and it never needs to, it wasn't designed for it.  And yes I said HORROR, there's nothing Sci-Fi about this thing beyond the aliens.  There's no science or even pseudo science.  No hypothesis or ruminations on the future or the past.  Aliens are just the monster of choice and why not, they can look exactly like people, and that must save a ton of money in special effects....",1235001600,2,2631,4.614224137931035

3696743,5,B001MEJYDW,"Moderately scaled indie film, but really quite excellent. Just pretend the title doesn't exist. Tape over it with your own, more clever title. But it's a very tight script; the ""robbers"" from the beginning have a sordid history that unviels throughout the film, but you're only told what you need to know to enjoy the movie and wonder about these people. The action is tastefully full of gore, but rarely does the movie hold too long on the squishiness. And there's no UFO, ignore the cover, but there are aliens.

Anyway, it's a solid 85 minute romp, and I'm really glad I saw it. It plays on some cliches, flips over others. Tis a good time.

You can tell this film was done on a shoestring budget, but only by the very few couple of CGI moments. Everything else is top notch. The suspense is intense. The action is no joke! The makeup is incredible for a movie that starts off looking like a high-school film project. I swear I haven't been this surprised in a long, long time.

I've seen many big budget sci-fi movies fail miserably where this one succeeded. Heck, I hope some studio decides to buy the rights and remake it or make a part two. It's that good. This genre is littered with gore and aliens that all feel the same. This one seems to blend some classics with some of backdrop of 'The Mist'. The cinematography evolves and gets better as the film goes. The sound is surprisingly great on my home theater. Honestly, I'm speechless.
