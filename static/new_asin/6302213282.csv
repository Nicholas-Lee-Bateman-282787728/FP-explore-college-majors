437576,5,6302213282,"Ok first things first. It has the cliff hangers. That is important to me. The story line is pitiful, but I loved it. These guys just can't  aim and shoot and hit anything. Now watch the secretary. She hits what she aims and gets her man. In more ways than one. So corny I just loved it and will watch again. Picture is nice and clear and sound is good. What more could you ask?",1474070400,,377,4.026666666666666
437577,4,6302213282,"By the time Republic made this 1950 serial, the money-saving factor of using previous scenes from earlier serials had become prevalent.  For instance a climactic crash between a car and plane was lifted from the 1946 CRIMSON GHOST serial, a superior effort (and more deserving of this deluxe treatment, IMHO !)  Be that as it may, I still enjoy that big door coming down and almost squashing Kent (I actually saw this on a Saturday matinee when I was around 8).  And I love the music, even though it's repeated ad nauseum throughout the various chapters.  The title card with the space ship zooming across the screen and the wonderful swirling strings, then...BOOM ! that brass doom note as the chapter cards come up.
The composer(s) and music editor(s) took these films dead seriously...and I love it....nothing compares today.",1473811200,4,828,4.9352517985611515

437584,4,6302213282,anytime you get martians wanting to take over earth via any manner of takeover you have to watch.  it's a decent serial.  it is one for people who like movie serials a lot.  it's back and forth.  it's not violent.  james craven is in it in his best role as the scientist bad guy who helps the martians.  walter reed is in this one and then in government agents vs. phantom legion (which has no phantoms and not enough to make a legion).  see this one first before that one.  you'll be familiar with reed and his history a little more and have more of a familiarity with him.  harry lauter is yet again a henchman.,1367280000,3,613,4.2155172413793105

I clicked on it thinking it was a preview and I wound up watching a whole episode before I knew it.  Mandatory fight scene was better than Radar men.

437684,3,6302213282,"This serial is good, however this DVD is not.  While the serial has 12 episodes, the DVD menu only lists EIGHT (?) and the DVD menu entries drive you to DIFFERENT EPISODES that you would expect.  So -- if you select EPISODE 7, it actually takes you to episode 11.  If you select EPISODE 8, it takes you to episode 12 (which, in the case of the DVD that I got from WAREHOUSE DEALS, then freezes up a few minutes into the final episode so you can't see the final episode).  There actually are all 12 episodes on the DVD, the issue is just that the DVD menu is messed up.

I am re-ordering this DVD from AMAZON hoping to find a copy that plays all the way through as apparently WAREHOUSE DEALS does refunds but not replacements.

As for the serial itself, the most noteworthy aspect is the ""rising sun"" logo on the tail of the ""flying disk"" (actually a bat-shaped airplane).  The logo is due to the airplane prop originally being built for the serial KING OF THE MOUNTIES about a Japanese invasion of Canada during WW2.  The rest of the serial is basically cuts from THE PURPLE MONSTER STRIKES and KING OF THE ROCKET MEN.",1326672000,8,1118,4.341346153846154

The chapter index for the serial is horrible.  This serial is 12 chapters long, yet the index only shows 8!!!  When you select chapter 4 it plays chapter 6!!!!!!!!!

437687,3,6302213282,"Memories of the ""semi-disc"" had flitted through my memory for years before I finally tracked down a copy of this old Republic serial. It's an entertaining diversion for those who can put themselves in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. The DVD has almost no liner notes and the most basic on-screen menu, but the video and audio transfer was clear and sharp. Recommended for fans of Republic serials; others could probably find a more useful way to spend the time.",1283904000,14,466,4.626506024096385
437688,3,6302213282,"Good Fifties Republic serial, typical sci fi plot for the era, decent acting, lots of action,
Pretty cheesy by todays sci fi standards, but a good Saturday night B movie of the era.
One of the better Republic cliffhanger serials, Martians trying to take over the world are foiled by the good guys,
Edited into a movie length feature called Missile Monsters in the late Fifties.
My only complaint is the DVD picture quality is really bad, about the same as a VHS tape dubbed onto DVD,
Watchable, but not nearly as good as it should be.
Four stars for the feature!
One star for the DVD picture quality!",1258761600,29,600,4.513761467889908

437691,5,6302213282,"This serial has plenty of action as a Martian lands on Earth and uses the help of an industrialist to help take over. He stows his flying disc in an active volcano, of all places. This serial reflects the fears of the times that foreign powers would infiltrate to seek atomic secrets for world domination. After all the cold war had begun. But don't woory, the Martian never gets close to his nefarious plan as the hero, who has his own plane, thwarts the Martian and his henchmen at every turn, although their are a lot of close cliffhanger calls!",1241049600,,548,4.49
437692,5,6302213282,"This serial is a fun look into early sci-fi. A Martian crash lands on earth and gets an inventor of special ray gun to help him in his efforts to take over the world. The Martian builds another flying disc and uses an active volcano as a hide-out. Can the dashing air patrolman, Kent, thwart this plot? Plenty of fights and cliffhanger endings to each chapter. You can see the cold war paranoia in this serial, as the Martian has a vague Russian sounding accent. All in all, fun for any collector of retro scifi.",1235606400,2,512,4.4

When you see the Olive logo and Republic Eagle logo fade, then you know that anything can happen, and usually does, only  this time it  happens in blu ray
picture and sound that puts you right in the theater with all the action. Olive Films is second to none when it comes to these great Republic Serials. The complete Republic Library is owned by Paramount Pictures and with their collaboration with Olive we hopefully will see many more releases in the future. I will not go into storyline and action as it has been covered very nicely in other reviews. This is an excellent blu ray restoration of a 67 year old film that is surely to please even the pickiest of old school serial buffs. I am 100%+ satisfied and highly recommend it. Thank you again Olive Films for your excellent work.
P.S. Don't watch all 12 chapters back to back. Maybe one a day or every other day, or weekly as it was intended to be seen. You will get so much more out of it and really be anxious to see how he got out of last weeks cliffhanger.

Nice transfer and clean sound, though I found the sound a little low. No extras but still worth the price. Olive can get me hooked on these serials if they keep up the good work. So if you like this one, check out Commando Cody from them, it's even better.",1490572800,2,403,4.246753246753247
