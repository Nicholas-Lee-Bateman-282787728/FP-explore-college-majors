461514,5,6302405696,"What would it happen if you break the neck to logic, conventional social principles set out of context and play with the sense of the words meaning? What if you bet to exchange certain components of our quotidian way of thinking, becoming a messy puzzle? How amount of truth are you able to bear?

That far premise that enlightened the mind of Luis Buuel in The exterminating angel, reappears with major vigor, irreverence and petulance. This genial Spanish filmmaker simply disorders the rules that govern our real world through dreamy, cynical and surrealistic vignettes, where the Status Quo can be demolished with a simple lash of fingers. Costumes, moral, ancestral codes, elemental logic, pattern behaviors are broken with impeccable cold blood, perhaps to intend us to convince us we can live another different world , just rearranging the basis that support the enormous building of our normal behavior.

The initial shot comes from a Goya  painting and finalizes with the astonishing feared ostrich trying to hide from us in the zoo.

Knowing the heavy burden of surrealism that always accompanied Don Luis, and being perhaps the lonely Ambassador in the Sixties of that discolored flag, many elements might escape your solid and logic perception, just turn around it and think it over.

A glorious imagination ` s triumph.",1135814400,,1332,5.091743119266055
461515,5,6302405696,"I'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that Buuel's later films do not show this Spanish master at his best, that his earliest films---his famous collaborations with Salvador Dal, for instance---show an edgier, more fascinating Buuel. Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more entertaining than DISCREET CHARM.

There is no plot to speak of in PHANTOM: this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds Buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images. Monks pray for a woman's sick father, and then play poker with the woman and smoke. A group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets, and go to the bathroom to eat in private. Two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter---even though she's right there in class when they call her name. In the universe Buuel concocts in THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY, anything goes.

The amazing thing about this movie is that, instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches, THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY has a broad theme to support its free-form structure: it's Buuel's comic vision of freedom run amuck. Sure, the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but, as Buuel seems to be suggesting, even freedom has its limits. The opening scene of the movie is set in Toledo, Spain in 1808, as Napoleon's troops attempt to liberate the Spanish and are greeted with cries of ""Down with liberty!"" There can be times when we want the assurance of authority, rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please.

Buuel doesn't take a stand one way or the other, really; he's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea, and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film, and its content. Almost anything and everything he can think of---within the bounds, I suppose, of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career---is thrown into this movie, and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure, I found its elegant chaos exhilarating.

Only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this. I think Buuel pulls it off triumphantly here; somehow, he makes the movie seem almost logical, the way it progresses. THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is a sheer delight. Highly recommended.",1128124800,15,2542,4.850230414746544
461516,5,6302405696,"Bunuel is an acquired taste to be sure, but fascinating once acquired.  Throwing away any semblance of traditional narrative, Bunuel works with film as Magritte and Dali did with paint, using surrealism to cast absurd light on institutions which comprise weird reality.  By turns funny, disturbing, and thought-provoking.",1124755200,2,321,5.666666666666667
461517,5,6302405696,"Bunuel turns things upside down in this social critique which, surely, ranks as one of his most effective films. While this film drifts through the surreal world we would expect of Bunuel - the commentary it makes is indeed serious and quite thought provoking. If we, as viewers, are shocked or find humor in the scenes of this film we should stop and ask ourselves - Are we as liberated as we think we are? If you find using the toilet in front of your friends and going off to eat in private absurd - you are not the open minded person you think you are.",1118361600,7,556,4.254716981132075
461518,5,6302405696,"Luis Buuel began his career filming a short film, Un Chien Andalou (1929), together with Salvador Dali and they agreed on one thing before making the film - the idea that each scene should not reveal anything in regards to rational thought.  At the end of his career Buuel made The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), which won the Oscar for the best foreign film in 1973.  Winning the Oscar and the success of the film gave Buuel an opportunity create whatever he desired.  Consequently, Buuel returned to his accustomed traditions of surrealism and the workings of the subconscious through a cinematic experience that would leave many scratching their heads and applauding simultaneously - The Phantom of Liberty.

The Phantom of Liberty, in essence, is not a single film in the traditional sense, as Buuel moves away from cinematic convention by breaking the rules of filmmaking.  The principal distinction from other films is that Buuel draws the audience's attention to the film by presenting an idea that he slowly makes more interesting by introducing additional stimuli that build up the intrigue.  However, when the intrigue enters the climax Buuel simply leaves the story where it become most stimulating.  At this point he starts over with another less interesting story that moves forward with new intrigue that once again intensifies, and as before he tosses away the intrigue by starting over.

One of these stories within the film opens with ""I'm sick of symmetry."", as a man sits down watching the fireplace and a large preserved spider.  The man stands up while picking up the spider, as he shortly after slides the clock above the fireplace to the left and places the spider on the right.  This scene has nothing to do with what is about to happen, but it offers a brilliant analogy to how simple it is for Buuel to break the chains of cinematic convention in this film.  Yet, the film has a common thread that continues throughout the film, which brings to mind Marquis de Sade's literary works.  Much of the film offers suggestive sexual and erotic situations where some are more overt than others.

The opening of the film takes place in 1808 during Napoleon's occupation of Toledo where the French Army executes captured resistance while the officers are getting drunk within a church.  One of these drunk officers finds a sculpture of a kneeling woman attractive with which he tries to make advances on, but to the audience's astonishment the male kneeling statue next to him stops the officer with a resolute smack to the head.  This is one of several scenes in the film where a character presents deviant sexual behavior.  There is also the man who advances on a prepubescent girl on the playground, the family that defecates in the living room, and the four monks that play poker with the lady in a nightgown.  None of these scenes are explicit in nature, but the mere situation provides strong suggestive notion of the sexually tense moments that also have strong surreal ambiance.

Each moment in the film surrounds a surreal element that causes a cerebral conflict.  These moments seem dreamlike, but with enough reality to keep the audience guessing of what will happen next.  For example, there is a man who tries to go to sleep and is visited by an enormous rooster, a candle carrying woman, a postman who delivers a letter, and an emu.  Later, the man visits a doctor, as he found the night extremely disturbing to which the doctor responds that he must see a psychoanalyst.  To convince the doctor the man shows the letter that he received from the postman that visited him during the night in his bedroom.  Cleverly, Buuel displays the workings of the surreal in the subconscious, as he let reality converge with dream.  This makes it more difficult for the audience to separate the two, as they simply fall into what seems to be a blender that mixes anything that falls inside.

Visually The Phantom of Liberty offers something like a stroll through an art museum's section with surrealism, which suggests that Luis Buuel is not simply a film director trying to tell a story in the traditional sense.  Through Buuel's direction the audience can experience a plasticity in the manner the film moves along, but it is idiosyncratic in contrasts to the other cinematic geniuses such as Kurosawa, Fellini, and Bergman among others.  It is the peculiarity of Buuel that makes him unique, as he did not try to do what has already been made.  Instead he took the step into the unexplored and brought back from the deepest corners of the human psyche several experiences that none have ever been able to match.  Thus, the Phantom of Liberty offers a distillation of Buuel himself.",1117497600,8,4713,4.834371108343711
461519,5,6302405696,"Made two years after 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie', this film is both similar to and different from its predecessor: it is episodic and bourgeoisie is one of its main targets, but it contains more shots and scenes (it feels more dynamic), its tone is somewhat cruder and it is mostly geared towards individual quests, whereas 'Charm' usually dealt with almost all of the main characters at the same time; the 'Charm' elements 'Phantom' tends to recall are the stories that were told by supporting characters, and the bishop character himself (the man who played him, Julien Bertheau, has another very good role here). As strange as it may seem, the narrative is fairly linear throughout since the apparent breaks always flow from what has just gone on, although Bunuel characteristically chooses the most unpredictable transitions; it reminds me of a painting by the surrealist Yves Tanguy, 'Le Ruban des Exces', in which abstract forms mingle audaciously from the left side of the picture to the right without any interruption. Authority figures - policemen, judges, doctors, teachers, clergymen, parents - are first established in their customary roles only to lose their power and dignity soon after, often in surprising ways. The film's vignettes have been deemed 'existential' - I'd argue that the absurdity Bunuel considers here is not a source of anguish, but of art, absurdity being a means for the artist; it also hides a meticulous structure. This work's reputation is not quite as high as that of 'The Discreet Charm...', but it might be even better.",1081728000,5,1571,5.06949806949807
461520,5,6302405696,"Another great work by Luis Bunuel, The Phantom of Liberty has more outright humor in it than probably any of his other films.  When the private and public functions of eating and evacuating are reversed, and monks congregate in a room to watch a man get spanked by a dominatrix, and a soldier passionately kisses a statue, and a haughty professor's butt gets tagged with a full-of-pins paper cutout by some immature cadets, you know you're having fun.
Here it really seems as though Bunuel was essentially making fun of his own intense desire to engage in biting satire, because the feeling is much more of letting loose with some laugh-out-loud antics rather than the need to mercilessly slash and burn social conventions.  This is a much lighter film than one would typically expect from Bunuel, and yet that is not at all related to its significance.  It's a sharp piece of cinema, full of irreverence that, as many have already indicated, is closer to Monty Python than anything else.
Bunuel's sense of fun here does not require a plot, just as many of his other films don't.  But in this film the lack of formal narrative actually seems to work better than in several of his other works; we keep waiting for the next scene to see if it will top what we've just seen--regardless whether there's logic in the seguing or not (there almost always isn't).
A lot of fun and very highly recommended.",1061596800,23,1397,4.666666666666667
461521,5,6302405696,"The Phantom of Liberty is made up of a series of surrealist vignettes held together by the loosest of narrative structures - Think of a Monty Python episode without the laughter-track. The opening scene has prisoners facing a firing squad, defiantly clenching their raised fists, and shouting, ""Down with freedom"" and ""Long live chains."" This pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film. In another memorable scene, guests sit down at the dining table, but instead of chairs, they sit on toilets. To talk about food at the table is the height of vulgarity. There are other scenes just as good. This film may sound arty-farty, but it works and works brilliantly, and in no small part due to Luis Bunuel, who directs with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of effect. Don't let the surrealist tag put you off. This film is fun and was meant to be so. This may not be quite up there with the rest of Bunuel's classics : Belle De Jour, Simon of the Desert, or The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, with which The Phantom of Liberty has something in common; but it is still a minor masterpiece and will delight and baffle in equal measure.",1054684800,4,1143,4.526570048309178
461522,4,6302405696,"How does one describe a Luis Bunuel film? Moreso, how does one describe this particular Bunuel film? Take for example a scene where a man is taken to court found guilty, but, in this film guilty means you are set free and turned into a celebrity lol. Take for example a scene where a mother and father are called to school due to the fact they say their daughter is missing. At first we are shocked to hear this, then we find out that the girl is actually still IN the classroom, but, no one pays attention to her. Her mother and father are speaking to her, and continue to talk about trying to find their daughter lol! It's because of truly inventive and funny moments like this I'm able to say this is one of Bunuel's best films.
 ""The Phantom of Liberty"" was a sequel to ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"", while, this film has not aged as well as ""Bourgeoisie"" I feel ""Phantom"" is a better film. Bunuel's cynical humor seems to gel better here. He's was able to express his ideas better in this film. And entertains us moreso here.
 Despite the fact that this film is out-of-print in the US, my local library had a copy of it, if anyone ever gets a chance to rent this film or buy it, do so! Even if it's only for the fact that it's rare. If your a Bunuel fan, this film should entertain you. If your not a Bunuel fan yet, this would be just as good a place as any to start with to get a feel of Bunuel's style.",1015977600,,1420,4.16
7825550,4,6302405696,"Im one of the rare few who actually prefer this film to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, which immediately preceded it in Bunuel's career. For me The Phantom of Liberty is even more playful, daring and fun. According to the introduction by co-writer Jean-Claude Carriere on the Criterion release, Bunuels strategy was to set up a whole series of stories, but never complete one, to move off onto the next just where wed normally get the satisfying conclusion. But Bunuel saw that life doesnt work like that, and has great fun leading us away with some supporting character, right when wed normally be expecting answers and resolutions.

In the broad scope, the theme could said to be how human beings confuse liberty with arbitrary, and how we don't question the absurdity of our institutions, religions, social conventions and even our own behavior with those we love. But the film is WAY more fun than that dry explanation makes it sound. Bunuel is a philosopher, but hes one by way of Monty Python, making us laugh at ourselves, even as he quietly acknowledges the tragedy under all our bizarre behavior.

7825552,3,6302405696,The Phantom of Liberty is straightforwardly surreal and absurd. The film has a knack for maintaining interest by making one alternatively wonder at what strange thing will happen next and to what extremes it can be taken. It is also amusing enough to earn a passing grade.,1444262400,,272,4.808510638297872
7825553,5,6302405696,"Much ink has already been spilled on this seemingly enigmatic film by Luis Buuel. Hereafter, an attempt to analyze some of the obvious and hidden aspects of this masterpiece.
The film uses two notions of the word phantom: specter (menace) and illusion.
The film also plays on many levels: political, religious, social, mental / physical, symbolical, psychoanalytical.

Political
The slogan Down with liberty is heard at the beginning and at the end of the film. Its message is clear.
First, we witness a staging of the famous Goya painting The Third of May, 1808 where Spanish prisoners, shouting this slogan, are shot by the French Republican army. 'Down with liberty means here 'Down with the French Republic and its sans-culottes, the defenders of the progressive motto Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'.
At the end of the film, the spectator vaguely hears a crowd (apparently a manifestation) which shouts the same slogan. The film was shot during a period when the Communist Party in France still had important political and social clout, especially through its trade union. This party was at that time heavily influenced by a totalitarian state, which was fundamentally opposed to certain freedoms, including political ones. 'Down with liberty' means here also 'Down with the French Republic'.

Religion, Justice
Religion (Catholicism) was (is) also threatened by liberty and the sans-culottes. The viewer assists at a desecration of a church and of holy bread by the French Republican army. In addition, for L. Buuel, representatives of the Church are corrupt: in the film, monks play cards and drink alcohol.
A sniper kills people indiscriminately in the street, apparently to sow panic among the population; so, it's a provocation (an utmost topical issue). He is condemned, but the sentences of the judges are not respected. To the contrary, the sniper is set free and congratulated by the judicial administration and by part of the population: down with liberty of justice.

Physical and mental life
A challenging aspect of the movies by L. Buuel is the dissociation between the physical (time, space) and mental (sentiments) reality.
One can see a perfect example of this dissociation in another film by L. Buuel (An Andalusian Dog), where a father slaps his son, followed by the text 'thirteen years later' and the action continues. In other words, in a split of a second (the slap) the son becomes thirteen years older (psychological time).
This dissociation is (perhaps) an explanation of the sequence of the film where a girl disappears while being present. She is physically present, but not mentally for her parents.

Illusion
Freedom is an illusion in matter of instincts (like for the animals of the zoo). In this regard, scenes of sexual deviances are constants in the films of L. Buuel as are dream sequences. Other psychoanalytic elements in this movie are anal fixation (a dinner where the guests are sitting on a toilet) or a split personality (the two prefects at the end of the film).
Liberty as an illusion is the basic outline of the screenplay: the journey of the characters is all the time disrupted by unforeseen encounters, accidents or bad weather.

The end of the film is a shot of an ostrich head, as if L. Buuel exhorts the spectator: don't put your head in the sand like an ostrich, but do face head-on the (hidden) reality as the bird on the screen.

7825555,5,6302405696,"An absurd piece of surrealism/comedy from Luis Brunuel, released in 1974. It has a lot of well-shot and nicely-acted scenes of absurdity that don't say anything about anything. It is an ensemble performance with no plot, just episodes that connect to each other and wander out of each other. Starting off with Napoleon's troops in France, and a statue coming to life to smack a cheeky legionnaire. A park pervert gives pictures to young girls, but it's not what you think it is (very funny). A man muses ""I hate symmetry"", while looking at a framed spider. He has a conversation about spiders with his daughter, time breaks down, some chickens wander by mistake, and a postman delivers a letter in his bedroom. The doctor tells him it is a dream, but then he can't explain the letter. The doctor's nurse asks him if she can have time off to visit her sick father, then she drives off, encounters a tank with three soldiers that are hunting foxes, then she checks into a crazy hotel that has poker-playing priests, a flamenco dancer, and a businessman who is traveling with his dominatrix (the woman on the cover). There is also a woman having a romantic getaway with her nephew (!?!?!) and there is passion and violence in their encounter, which is troubled but ends happily. One of the men in the hotel gets a lift from the hotel to the next town, where he teaches gerndarmes who are more like school children. People come and go, there is no discipline, and he's left with the worst two students in the class. The next scene in the movie is one of the best - it's the dinner where everyone sits at toilets around a table, then excuse themselves to go and get a bite to eat on their own in another room. The conversation is funny: in 20 years, there will be seven billion people in the world, each of them releasing 12 pounds of excrement and urine per day - that's 72 billion tons of the stuff every day! Then there is the case of the girl who disappeared from school, but she's there the whole time. They file a missing person's report, checking her out to see what she's wearing. Then months later she's found again. Another very good sequence is about a man who thinks that people who are cruel to animals should be executed; he turns out to be a sniper who kills a dozen people before he's apprehended; he's given the death sentence, but then wanders off and is treated like a celebrity. Finally, there's the man who meets a woman who looks just like his sister, he reminisces about the times that she used to play piano for him in the buff. The end of the film is a collection of zoo animals.

The movie is extremely well made, very funny, and consistently fascinating. The director plays trick after trick on the audience in a very classy manner, and nothing is as is expected. Beautiful.",1314316800,,2796,4.4931237721021615
7825556,5,6302405696,"Luis Bunuel was a director whose work spanned decades, countries and styles, yet, throughout, maintained a keen eye for satire and a talent for presenting surreal imagery.

This film is possibly the best example of these aspects, and is arguably his best. The dinner table scene related by the teacher is one of the most hilarious scenes I've ever watched, and like most of the comedic scenes in the film, never falls flat. Although the movie is essentially a collection of skits, they are tied in effortlessly, and do have common themes running throughout (the hypocrisy of authoritarian organizations, particularly clerical).

I think this is a really good example of Bunuel's work, for those who have heard or read about him and want to find out more. Sure, many will recommend Un Chien Andalou, which is an undisputed masterpiecek, but The Phantom of Liberty is a very different film made at a different time, and epitomises Bunuel's later work (after his return to Europe). Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in world cinema, or generally, those looking for humour with a purpose.",1225670400,,1097,4.9890710382513666
7825557,5,6302405696,"This film is my favorite of Bunuel's work.  It's similar to a full length Monty Python episode, except it's in French, and the women are much better looking.  It's very funny, surreal (of course), and strange, yet it makes a great deal of sense.  The scene where people defecate in public and eat in private is hilarious, the scene where the priest gives children normal cards to play with, but the adults think they're pornographic is great too.  The monks playing poker is quite a vivid image as well.  Does this all make sense?  Of course it does.  All of Bunuel's films make sense in their own way.  The final shot of an ostrich is a great way to end this film.  I remember showing Bunuel's final film, That Obscure Object of Desire, to my sister, and as open minded as she is, she hated the film and the ending.  She probably would have hated the ostrich ending in this one.  For those who think Richard Linklater's Slacker was great should watch this film.  The story structure (such as it is) of Slacker is exactly like the one here.  Slacker is a good film, but The Phantom of Liberty is far superior.  I love later Bunuel.

7825558,5,6302405696,"This excellent collection of satirical vignettes is my kind of movie - crazy, dark and comical, it goes any direction it wants and does not follow any rules. When we try to grasp for the meaning, it is like a ghost, a phantom that ""leaves us with a wisp of vapor in our hands"" and disappears - very much like the liberty, the freedom the humans try to find but instead could only see its phantom disappearing. The film follows many characters on its way shifting effortlessly and playfully from the central ones to the minor ones making minor ones the central and going back and forth from one time period to another. It opens in Toledo during the Napoleonic occupation then jumps to the modern day Paris. It could've gone anywhere and introduced me to any character - it still would've been enormously interesting because it was made by the master who had never lost his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his memory that consisted of the strange and amazing images, his sense of humor, his childhood dreams, his fantasies, dark and shining and who was able to throw them all on the screen like no one ever was able or will be able to do.

7825559,4,6302405696,"Harpo, Chico and Groucho, that is, more than Karl. Amusing and entertaining through and through, but not the pinnacle of Bunuel, which, in my eyes, is Tristana. But I've only seen 6 or 7 of his films. The extra feature, The Celebration of Chance, is invaluable. Bunuel's works are greatly helped by the commentaries of Jean-Claude Carriere. Carriere remarks that the title is an allusion to Marx. The truth is that the pursuit of liberty (or the idea that it can ever be attained) is, and has to be, illusory; and the movie medium actually accentuates the doomed nature of the search. No matter how much you twist and turn, invert the world, run counter to convention and reverse reality, the prison which fetters human perceptions can never be escaped. This is not exactly new. In fact there is a passage in one of Lewis Carroll's lesser known works, where the crowd shouts something like: Longer hours! Worse pay! Illogic has always had its adherents, and the non-sequitur has been known for centuries. Bunuel enjoyed the freedom in this film to do exactly what he wanted, and in one sense it is an expression of the fact that even with this freedom, to ignore plot, character development, cause and effect, the movie-maker is still constrained --- by something. The wish to produce a work of art, perhaps? Taken to its absurd extreme, the artist would end up in total solitude creating a work which he instantly destroys. The film has to be seen, however, and the one star has only been removed by a personal desire to be perverse. Wonderful cinematography, perfect performances, superb scenes and dialogue.",1170028800,5,1610,4.815884476534296
