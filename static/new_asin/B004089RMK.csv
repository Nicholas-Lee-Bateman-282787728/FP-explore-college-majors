8412221,5,B004089RMK,"Good story about the Battle of Fort Sumter. Great views of the fort and the city of Charleston from the harbor, the air, and the ground. When I was returning from a vacation trip to Orlando when I was 10, me and my family went by boat to Fort Sumter when we stayed a night in Charleston.",1513728000,,287,4.052631578947368
8412222,1,B004089RMK,"This was a very interesting perspective and a great study in presenting ones viewpoint. If I was teaching a class of the Civil War this would not be among references I would use.  If I was teaching a class in ideology or how to persuade public opinion I might.  The facts they present are fairly accurate and correspond to what I have read elsewhere.  But the interpretation of those facts just made me laugh at times.  And when they began to mock Lincoln's voice it lost all credibility. The fact that it was produced by Confederate Pictures I guess says all.  As I am interested in the Civil War and I am trying to study it from a historical perspective I felt very dissapointed.  Probably will just pitch it in the trash, and look for unbiased information elsewhere.",1502582400,,769,4.536231884057971

8412224,1,B004089RMK,The writers of this historically inspired fiction are either comic geniuses or completely inamorata of the historical record.  They do a great job twisting the truth and spinning history.,1425600000,,187,5.448275862068965
8412225,4,B004089RMK,"This is a very good and informative documentary.  It is not, and does not claim to be, fair and balanced.  This documentary was written and produced by southerners for southerners.  It is, however, very well researched and presents a strong case placing the blame for the war squarely on the side of the North.  I would recommend that all serious historians view this film.  Many facts, original documents, letters and telegraphs that tell a very detailed (and different) story about the decision to go to war in 1861 are presented.  Whichever side of this conflict you side with, you will not be fully informed without viewing this film or reading the references listed in it.",1391040000,3,677,4.843478260869565
8412226,4,B004089RMK,"Very comprehensive examination of the false flag incident known as Fort Sumter. With help from press ""sensitive"" to his cause, (sound familiar?), The newly elected President Lincoln could have ended any disputes in a non aggressive manner at many points, but chose the path that we now read about in our history books, both historically correct ones, and the works that lead us to an alternative version of reality. The participant's own words verify the premise stated above, in this piece.  As good as attending a free week of lectures on this subject at any good university, in my opinion.",1356912000,3,592,4.92
8412227,5,B004089RMK,"All Southrons should order a copy of this DVD, it's that important.  It covers the historical record in detail, demonstrating beyond doubt the duplicity of the Buchanan cabinet, many of whom then served Lincoln.

The point out the Tenth Amendment protection of state powers, and I add to that, that Article III, Section III of the US Constitution defines treason as making war against a state.

That Lincoln, his cabinet, and all ranking commissioned officers in the United States military at the time committed treason is fact supported by the record in this documentary.",1338422400,6,572,5.0638297872340425
8412228,5,B004089RMK,"George Wills has done an excellent job exposing the truth behind the Fort Sumter incident in April of 1861. The history books have usually pointed the finger of blame at the South for starting the war by firing without provocation upon the Union troops stationed at the fort. Wills' research proves differently - specifically, that the Confederates at Charleston were cunningly maneuvered by Abraham Lincoln into a no-win situation. As with all modern wars, a self-righteous veneer was concocted by the Lincoln Administration to hide the true economic reasons for waging a devastating four-year war against the Southern States. Get this DVD and check out Wills' resources for yourself.",1297468800,7,685,5.293577981651376
8412229,5,B004089RMK,"I think that George Wills' DVD, ""What Really Happened at Fort Sumter,""  is a magnificent contribution to the Sesquicentennial--for which the liberal media are running out all of their big guns to try to discredit and silence conservative America once and for all.  This DVD nails down the important points to demonstrate that the war was unquestionably provoked and triggered by Mr. Lincoln, and it does so in a way that cannot be successfully refuted.  -- Frank Conner",1296086400,6,469,4.987179487179487
