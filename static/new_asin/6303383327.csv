640866,5,6303383327,"One of my favorite childhood movies. Don't know why everyone's giving it such a bad rap - it's not for adults. It's a little dated, since it was set in the '90s (a reference to Baywatch would make your kids go ""huh?"") but it's a movie about every kid's fantasy - a summer camp with no adult supervision! I love how the kiddos start off crazy, then learn how to really help each other to pull the wool over their parents' eyes. And I absolutely love how they seem so vulnerable at times, reminding the viewer that they're just children, and they do need adults. It's funny, charming, and will always hold a special place in my heart.",1436572800,3,632,4.364406779661017

641062,4,6303383327,"I loved this movie when I was young, and I still love it! It's good to see movies we watched when we were growing up that had a little PG13 rated undertones that can still relate to kids today.

It's a movie for the entire family.  Thank you Amazon for being the only place I could find it!",1200096000,,245,4.170212765957447
641430,4,6303383327,"This movie was the reason I joined up with Amazon, thus, as everyone can guess, it can't be bad. Right? Right!

Let's start with the movie: it's very amusing. While there are only very few truly funny scenes (most notably the car wash scene with Cristopher Lloyd), the whole movie is lighhearted and easy going, with nice characters with whom you can identify. And altough there are a bunch of them the most important are 5: Mud, Gaby, Trish and Zach - the 4 main kids who originate the camp idea - and the adult they blackmail into helping them, Dennis. All have their quirks, all come to terms with them. And some come together in the process, which you, as the viewer, will if not love, then atleast like a lot. All in all I can say this is one decent family movie, which both the kids and the adults ought to like.

In other words - highly recommended!

Lets go to the next part - the packaging. While the extra features are few (Spanish audiotrack + chapter menu) the enhanced 16:9 transfer is excellent. You'll probably enjoy it even on a computer, as the final resolution is big enough for even 19"" monitors. The sound... well, this is the only detail I can complain about - the package carries a ""Dolby Digital Surround Sound"" notice, which ain't true - both audiotracks, while in Dolby's format, are only stereo. But as this ain't really a movie where you can do much with surround sound then this shouldn't be a reason why to skip this release. Besides the number of channels audio is fine.

So, to take it all together: very nice movie with very good picture and more than decent audio. And while there are practically no extras it's no reason why your family shouldn't own a copy of this DVD.",1169251200,2,1704,4.451923076923077

Some moral lessons, lightly delivered, but the highlight of the movie is Jonathan Jackson's performance, with a young Andrew ably Keegan supporting.

The high-speed turnarounds, when the parents come visiting expecting completely different camps, provide an exciting denouement & round off a fun movie for all the family.",1128643200,2,599,5.43010752688172

It is almost a five-star movie in my opinion, but I can't give it more than four because some of the scenes are just plain corny and/or ridiculous. And yes, as one reviewer mentioned, the parents are represented wrongly, in that they never suspected anything, which does not seem real.

On the other hand, that same reviewer mentioned that he did not finish watching this movie because of cursing. I seriously do not know what he is talking about. I only remember very occaisional and rather mild swearing.

641498,3,6303383327,"I have been reading the reviews, most of which are obviously written by teenagers or preteens.
My husband, also 30something, tuned into this on cable the other night. and we both sat and watched the whole thing.  It's ""Lord of the flies"" set in modern day, but much more fun to watch.
Christopher Lloyd, best known as ""Reverend Jim"" on t.v. show Taxi, and ""Doc Brown"" in the Back to the Future movies is the only known star that shows up in most of the movie.  He plays the authority figure throughout the film when the parents' aren't.
It's a ""let's see how much we can get away with while the parents aren't looking"" movie.  and I have to admit, it was pretty cool..Both my husband and i were thinking: That is cool..I wish I could've done that.  It's a fantasy for younger teens.  Basically, some rich kids pool all their summer camp money together and create their own fantasy camp and their parents think that they are all at the camps they were originally supposed to go to for the summer: fat camp, computer camp, drama camp..  instead, it's just 'HAVE FUN ALL SUMMER camp..OR Camp Nowhere at some run down land that Lloyds' character finds.
The teens all come together and help Lloyd from going to jail.
It's a cute little film that certainly isn't one of the most classic of the teen genre, but certainly is entertaining enough.
A lot of silliness goes on, and eventually chaos!!!  the parents want parents day..of course, they have to get caught eventually, right?

Although I'm 17 years old, I still find this movie very enjoyable. It's about this geeky kid named Mudd (Jonathan Jackson) and three other kids (including Andrew Keegan), who come up with a plan to make their summer vacation the most fun vacation they've ever had - by creating their own camp called Camp Nowhere, with the help of an ex-drama teacher named Dennis (Christopher Lloyd). The camp was just supposed to be for the four of them, but then a bunch of other kids find out about the camp and they end up going to the camp, too! It's a wild and crazy summer for the kids with no rules or responsible adults. The kids get to do whatever they want, while their parents think they are away at computer camp, weight-loss camp, military camp, or drama camp! And of course, they've got megabucks to spend on whatever they want from the money their parents paid for the camps. But then their parents come for parents' day and they have to prove to them that they are really at the camps their parents thought they were!
This movie is very hilarious and fun to watch with your friends. You can watch it over and over again without ever getting tired of it. With an allstar cast including Jonathan Jackson, Andrew Keegan, and Christopher Lloyd and a great script, how could you go wrong? If you haven't seen CAMP NOWHERE, I definitely recommend that you do.
