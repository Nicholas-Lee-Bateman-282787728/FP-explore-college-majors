1849353,4,B00008K76Q,"I will not bother to write a different review for each Zatoichi movie.  I have all twenty six of his movies and have watched all of them multiple times. Although the believability of a blind swordsman is next to nill, Zatoichi makes it believable because you will fall in love with the character.  Shintaro Katsu is one of my all time favorite actors.",1357171200,,351,4.555555555555555
1849354,5,B00008K76Q,"Another beautifully crafted film. This one has a slightly different twist in that conflict arises over control of a waterway. No vague notions of honor or noblesse oblige here. Basically, it is a rare Zatoichi film where both sides have a clear agenda from the outset. While it lacks some of the suspense of a typical Zatoichi film, it does keep the pacing moving.",1198800000,,364,4.703125
1849355,5,B00008K76Q,"This 7th episode of Zatoichi, starring Shintaro Katsu, is another gem in the long running series. In the opening scene a shot rings out. Ichi has been shot by an assassin. Not to worry, there are plenty of episodes ahead. He's shot, but it's just a flesh wound. Apparantly not even bullets can stop Zatoichi: Just bad marksmen!

With the summer festival fast approaching, rights to the waterway become a problem when unscrupulous officials, and corrupt yakuza bosses play sides against one another. That is where our protagonist Zatoichi enters the fray. There are some great fight scenes involving Ichi and the ""gangsters"" he's up against. One in particular involves a showdown in the river-bed. A hilarious scene of disappearing samurai.

And then there is the stuttering yakuza boss Yasugoro. Ichi gives him one hell of a time. And then there's Bekinichi' son Seirecko, the antagonist who shot Ichi in the opening film. ALL these character make for another delightful and entertaining Zatoichi-fest. This episode brings with it beautiful cinematography, and wonderful scenes of the Japanese countryside. This 7th entry of Zatoichi is truly rich in magnificant colors. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1157241600,6,1202,5.255208333333333
1849356,5,B00008K76Q,"This is number seven in the series, and again, absolutely totally entertaining in every facet of filmmaking.  Master Ichi pays a visit to a gang boss to thank his daughter for saving his life, and of course gets caught up in one of his more entertaining plots.  This boss is pretty much a good boss, and is planning a fireworks show for the people in his area.  Another boss, the bad boss, wants to gain control of the concessions at a local river crossing.  Now this is a pretty silly plot to say the least, but everything is played out as if this was a good enough reason for a total gang war.  There is the usual humor with Master Ichi, that makes his character one of the most beloved in Japanese film history.  Many many memorable scenes in this episode, but right at the beginning Ichi is being bothered by a fly as he tries to sleep.  He takes out his sword, listens very intensely, and lightening fast raises his sword and slices the fly in two.  Precious, to say the least.",1107820800,62,982,4.327868852459017
1849357,5,B00008K76Q,"This is one of my favorite Zatoichi films. The best thing about Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) is that he can play a role with such sincerity and emotional involvement that he can pull you in to any one of his roles. He has had quite an acting career in Japan, this being his 7th Zatoichi full length feature. I think this is where the movies started going in a different direction. All of the movies are great. But this one in particular starts to show the true cinematography and action that really defined these movies and Katsu as truly ahead of there time.
The funny thing about these movies are,you don't even need to like martial art movies to like Zatoichi. ALL of the movies have an intricate plot and story line. Very impressive!
I'm extremely excited that they finally came out with good transfers to DVD of the Zatoichi movies. Very good Quality and a very good movie.",1048032000,36,875,4.544303797468355

7985013,4,B00008K76Q,"Instead of fighting with their fists, he fought with his wits and his sword.....and a healthy dose of a good script.  Of course Zatoichi was too quick, but it is still good escapism viewing.",1379548800,,190,4.588235294117647
7985014,5,B00008K76Q,Another of the great series that most people in the US know nothing about. I loved it from the moment I saw it. Bib big fan now. Just sorry there is nothing really like it now. I guess nothing will ever compared to that time period.,1368489600,,232,4.065217391304348
