6229981,5,B00HVJZ576,"Just delightful, the sort of iconic extrovert role Mary's fans loved to see it.  Well worth the effort to see.  Excellent print quality.",1454284800,2,136,4.869565217391305
6229982,5,B00HVJZ576,I have long been grateful to silent movies they taught me to read facial expressions and body language! But soon I got taken in by the creativaty and the stories and the acting and the unfamiliar actors/actresses. Mary Pickford is one of my favorites! Pollyanna is a delightful story and Marys acting is top notch in my opinion. The story of Pollyanna is fantastic about an orphan girl dealing with the blows life sends her and triumphing with her glad game! It is more than enough to teach anyone about cheerfulness. Amazon rating:1 star due to horrible employee treatment.,1434931200,2,574,4.808080808080808
8636513,3,B00HVJZ576,"I realize that Mary Pickford was a great star, but when she made this film, she was 29 years old playing a character who was 11 or 12. She was a very diminutive person, but her face still looks like that of a mature adult. Ironically, it's kind of fun to watch for exactly that reason.",1486166400,,285,4.107142857142857
8636514,5,B00HVJZ576,It was good to see how the older movies (silent type) evolve. But the lesson is still the same; be positive in spite of the negative behavior of others.,1485388800,,152,4.275862068965517
8636515,3,B00HVJZ576,"It was interesting to see a movie with Mary Pickford, but I had a hard time sitting through the whole movie.  I am much to acclimated to our modern day.  I love this story and it was an interesting way to see it portrayed.",1483920000,,222,4.0227272727272725

8636522,5,B00HVJZ576,"Mary Pickford's silent 1919 Pollyanna. It is slightly different from the 1960's Pollyanna. This one had us laughing. This was a good one, it has a good teaching story on appreciating what you have and the good things in life.",1469750400,,225,4.65
