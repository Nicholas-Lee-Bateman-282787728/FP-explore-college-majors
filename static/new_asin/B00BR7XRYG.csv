5668330,5,B00BR7XRYG,"From the director/writer who brought us ""Identity Theft"", James Ward has done it again! Using his ""body-switch"" playbook, he has upted the antie with another winner! Increased production values, more locations, and a larger cast makes Ward's latest indie movie move into the world of theatrical-looking releases. His efforts of writing are never condescending or blatantly crass, going for the ""shock value"" most indie film makers go for these days. Instead, Ward carefully crafts his movie with an obviously eye for flair and comedy without having to stoop to the lowest common demoninator of F-bombs, gratutious sex, or 'dick jokes'. ""The Hit Girl"", although a movie about an assassin, has so little blood that it reminded me of an early John Carpenter and his movies. This is an enjoyable movie that you can easily see that the actors were having as much fun making as was the crew. And best of all, the acting is a cut above the usual smaller indie films which pull acting talent wherever and whenever they can find it. Ward cast many of Ventura County's theater people in his movie for his talent pool and it shows on screen...another feather in his resource cap. I, personally, am looking forward to his next endeavor!",1363046400,2,1224,4.889423076923077
5668331,4,B00BR7XRYG,"Spoiler alert: Ignoring the admonition to ""be careful what you wish for,"" a ""good guy"" hit man finds himself transformed into the body of a teenage girl. With an assignment still looming, he (she) needs to first figure out how to meet the physical demands of the job, while keeping a low profile. Ella Celina Bowen provides a credible, kick-ass performance as the hit man trapped in a girl's body, and James Castle Stevens delivers as an amusing, affable hit man. A fun adventure, directed with humor by James Ward.",1362960000,,515,4.733333333333333
5668332,5,B00BR7XRYG,"We loved watching this movie! We found it to be action packed and filled with laughs!

My husband and I both found the writing & directing to be superb! Awesome job!

The entire cast deserves major applause for delivering some of the best acting we have seen!

This is definitely one we are recommending to friends and are watching again! :)",1362960000,5,341,4.557377049180328
5668333,4,B00BR7XRYG,"Had a good time watching it.  Tons of nods to 80s sci fi films in the script, laughed several times.",1443225600,,100,4.0
5668334,5,B00BR7XRYG,"I recently learned about this movie after finding James Ward's YouTube account. After seeing the youtube shorts he's produced I rented this movie. It was definitely the best hour and half I've spent recently. I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that I not only have watched it several times (Amazon rental is for about a week), but I also bought the DVD for my collection.

If you have not seen this movie or saw any of James stuff on YouTube, you really should. You will really enjoy all of his work.",1443139200,2,501,4.445652173913044
5668335,5,B00BR7XRYG,It's funny and well thought out. I'd love to see a sequel,1442102400,,57,3.8333333333333335
5668336,5,B00BR7XRYG,"I loved this movie! Fans of magical age regression and transgender transformation stories definitely won't be disappointed, because this film serves up a few of our favorite tropes and makes them seem fresh again. (There is actually a valid plot reason for the transformed guy to wear a sexy schoolgirl outfit, for instance.) It's a fun and surprisingly sweet movie, and the characters have more depth than you'd usually expect in a high concept, gender-bender comedy. It is violent at times, but then again this IS a story about a pro killer and we're not talking about a lot of gore or anything. There is some dark humor here, so go in knowing that while it's a very cute, funny movie it does have an edge and it's not just rainbows and fluffy kittens.

I could definitely see some improved technique since James Ward's previous movie, Identity Theft. While I did enjoy Identity Theft, this movie had sharper scripting and cinematography, and a more professional sheen to it overall. The two lead actresses were great, and I was especially impressed by Ella Bowen, the actress who played Jessica. (Minor spoiler warning:) There's a scene where she sings, and she has to play a man in the body of a teenage girl, singing a song well, while being SURPRISED that she can sing like that. That is a hell of an acting challenge, and she totally sold it.

Definitely give this film a look. It's a lot of fun, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what Ward does next! (Dare we hope for a sequel?)",1436140800,2,1494,4.633962264150943

5668343,3,B00BR7XRYG,"Not bad at all. It has a lot of rough edges but it makes up for that by having a lot of heart. The main characters were acted well, the music was decent and the story was very focused, there are many Hollywood movies that have million dollar budgets and utterly fail because of horrible writing.  The villains were a little cornball and cheesy but the main actress does a very good job of convincing you that she is a 44 year old hit man.  Overall the movie was impressive considering the limited budget and resources at Mr. Ward's disposal.  I would be curious to see what he could do if he had a Hollywood budget.",1411084800,,615,4.2844827586206895
5668344,5,B00BR7XRYG,This movie was awesome. I loved the jokes and the tone of the whole thing. I also liked how the TG was definitely a factor that was reflected in the film.

5668347,5,B00BR7XRYG,"I really liked this independent movie. It had a good story of how a 220 pound, 44 year old hit man is transformed into a teenage hit girl and the problems that come with that change. He is still him in a much smaller more emotional body.",1404432000,,237,4.0638297872340425
5668348,4,B00BR7XRYG,"The story was nicely written, and the dialog felt reasonably 'real'.

The lead actors Bowen and Arnstein did a very good job overall, with only a few stiff exchanges. The other actors were mostly competent, with one notable exception. Fortunately, it wasn't a large role, and the issues easily ignored.

As noted, it's a solid example of the transformation story, with some interesting twists and turns. There's some depth to it, but not enough to keep it from being a good candidate when looking for a mindless-action-comedy, and enough depth that those looking for more may be satisfied as well.",1403308800,,597,4.96
5668349,5,B00BR7XRYG,"Rented this on amazon prime, i thought it would be a bad movie turned out it was funny and i watched it 4 times, for the rental price you get the moneys worth and its very good movie too, highly recommended and a 5 stars.",1402704000,,221,3.933333333333333
5668350,5,B00BR7XRYG,"In my opinion better than some of the high budget more famous sex change transformation movies out there. Better yet it has the best transgender (TG) transformation ending I have ever seen. Some huge spoilers follow...

From the roleplaying game start I knew right away this one was going to be a keeper. Plenty of laughs in this movie all the way through. I only rented it but now I'm going to buy it to watch whenever I want again and again. Just in comparison, the higher budget movie ""Switch"" does not stack up to the quality and comedy of The Hit Girl as far as I'm concerned and Ella Bowen does a far better job acting the part of the male turned female hero/heroine than any TG/TF movie I've seen by far. Extremely believable acting here and funny, funny, funny. I don't want to ruin the clever comedy but when the two bloody nosed girls came out of the audition house the comment from across the street from the bad guys was absolutely hilarious.

The story itself had me fooled at first since right away you go into it thinking the hit man is the bad guy, which in fact he's not as we later learn. That he has to continue his latest mission even after making a dumb wish that got granted, turning him into a teenaged girl sets up for the upcoming hilarity that is a treasure to watch unfold. The story progresses along at a nice pace and we learn that there's a way to undo the wish - but wait, there's more! Instead of being able to change back right away the new girl has to finish her assassination job and save the day by rescuing a kidnap victim. The transformation device is on the scene by now and things go terribly arwy for one extremely unlucky bad guy (well they're all unlucky by this point). Then as it turns out the transformation device, a statue with scales a.k.a. justice style, has the scales reset to even out after every use. Time must be waited between uses and the scales can be tipped back again but... Well, you'll have to see it for yourself.

Excellent movie. Highly recommend it and looking for more from this team.",1398470400,2,2051,4.377952755905512

5668353,4,B00BR7XRYG,"People will likely give this one a 4, if they took into account that about everyone was new to this honest reviewers would be giving it a 6.

5668365,5,B00BR7XRYG,"I saw this movie advertised on another web page  earlier this yr. Then  in a random search here. I came across this movie. Surprised at all the positive reviews .I decided to give this movie a chance. It didn't disappoint. An odd mix of tough guy,teenage,slapstick and a little crude humor this is just one funny ride.acting and sets were good,the sound track seemed too be a bit off had to adjust volume for action scenes and some talking(if was possible id give it 4.5 for this).Warning may have spoilers.
 The movie in a nutshell -Bill is a hit man ,who takes a job in his old  neighborhood. He decides too visit  his sister and his niece who still live there. His sister's work allows her too bring home museum .pieces,one of which is a statue of a woman holding scales. Bill is talked into babysitting his movie buff niece ,when his sister is called into  work over night. At one point they end up in the same room as the figure. He leans on it and says he'd rather have the problems of a teenage girl as opposed too his own. From going too bed 44 yr old man to waking up 14 yr old girl. Life or is it magic has thrown Bill now dubbed Jessica -quite a large curve .But the job must get done. So begins training ,quite humorously too as those manly heavy dumbbells along with  those big guns,aren't going too cut it anymore. Not when his new smaller body can be pushed around by bigger girls. Its the smaller dumbbells,and guns for this kid. Adding too this is learning new life lessons from other girls,niece and his sister. Can she get the job done? Will she go back too normal?

5668367,5,B00BR7XRYG,"I'm usually not a fan of indie films, being spoiled by all the shiny big budgets of big studios. That being said, I appreciate true talent, and the ability to tell a good story.

I was immediately drawn into the movie from the beginning. It had good structure, great story, and flowed without inconsistencies or plot holes. The actors were great and the ensemble worked together very well and seemed to have a real chemistry. Half way through I forgot I was watching an indie film. It had a very Whedonesque feel, but completely fresh and original in its timing and humor. The dialog was catchy, and I was laughing throughout the movie. The sets/locations, costumes, props, and special effects all were surprisingly well thought out and well utilized for an indie movie on a budget. Everything worked.

A lot of thought and heart obviously went into this film to give the viewer the most entertainment value possible.  I highly recommend this movie and look forward to seeing more from this studio in the future!",1366416000,3,1012,4.771428571428571

The story is engaging, the people (except, of course, the bad guys) likeable, the dialogue funny and surprising and the ending was superb. This was worth my time to watch, and I'll enjoy sitting through it again. I'm familiar with an awful lot of the ""tg-transformation"" tropes, but James Ward managed to surprise me and engage me with a story that, once you accept the premise, never once strained my suspension of disbelief and got me to laugh like hell.

5668371,5,B00BR7XRYG,"Wow!  I love supporting indie-anything, and this endeavor by indie film maker James Ward really delivers!!  The Hit Girl is a surprisingly well-rounded effort; the script is fresh and entertaining; the characters are extremely likable; the acting is extremely well done, and the cinematography is pretty darn seamless - - nothing jarring to take you out of the moment while watching.  I hate to sound like a skeptic by using a word like ""surprisingly"", but the quality of this movie is much more ""mature"" than I was anticipating.  I am willing to compare it to Robert Rodriguez' first effort, El Mariachi, which was more low-budget-looking than The Hit Girl, in my opinion.

I am the mother of 4, but my kids are all >13+ yrs now, so this movie was appropriate for them all to enjoy.  No gratuitous language, some violence (after all, it is about a hitman, errr, hit girl!), and some fairly tame strip club action, but overall a movie that parents can enjoy with their teens.  There is plenty of humor, subtle humor, not in your face farce humor.  I am a sucker for strong female characters who are forced by circumstances beyond their control to conquer their fear and discomfort in order to defend and protect others (a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and I have to say, the characters of the hit girl and the niece were strongly written to fit that bill.  As the mom of girls, I really appreciate that!  I highly recommend The Hit Girl!",1363305600,11,1437,4.644268774703558

Not easy to play a guy now girl like those freaky Friday type movies. For an indie studio this was made really good on a budget!! It is worth the watch for the humor and action.
