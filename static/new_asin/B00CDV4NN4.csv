5716866,4,B00CDV4NN4,loved it! super fairy tail fan! I just wish Funimation would stop releasing it in chunks....it's a lot of money for the first season. :(,1377302400,,136,4.48
5716867,5,B00CDV4NN4,This Anime is absolutely amazing. The storyline is very cool along with the characters and the role they play :) This anime is like a 10 woahs and a half; highly recommended to everyone :D,1377216000,,188,4.4
5716868,5,B00CDV4NN4,"First off there are numerous of reviews that give you all the in and outs of anime and a series I tell why I like it
I got to see a few episodes on Hulu I had to own this series love the characters and story lines
I bought the second collection then the next installment and today the next one out will be here
So unless you want to get hooked and have some fun stay away from this one LOL
Sorry for the same review but I feel the same way about all the ones I have watched made a slow summer allot more fun",1376956800,,507,3.7476635514018692
5716869,5,B00CDV4NN4,A combination of One Piece and Rave Master this is an awesome series. Will recommend anytime to anyone looking for something new and ongoing,1376611200,3,140,4.875

5716871,5,B00CDV4NN4,"been waiting for this since forever, now i finally got this yesterday, if you like Fairy Tail get it, first you get 25-48 episodes, on both Blu Ray and DVD. Second the price, i love Funimation since they release 2 versions of Fairy Tail first in Parts that have better packaging and they release earlier than the collections for around $30-$50 dollars. Where as the collections come like 2 months after with a price of $30 on Amazon. As for what i think of Fairy Tail is pure epicness. Seriously i love Erza, well thats my review. 10/10. Also someone noticed the product says 1.33 aspect ratio, its really in 16x9 wide screen format wich means no black bars on the sides or top down.",1375401600,24,683,4.472
5716882,1,B00CDV4NN4,"Product wasn't as advertised. DVD was episodes 13-24, those are already included in season 1, not sure why this set was sent but it was wrong. Product being purchase was to be episodes 25-49.",1504483200,,191,4.647058823529412
5716883,2,B00CDV4NN4,"It was a nice price, but it took a while to get here and the DVDs are REGION LOCKED so now I have to buy a new DVD player. If you don't have a region free DVD player, or one that plays region 2 DVDs than your out of luck. One the good side they are in perfect shape though, so that's good. All I gotta say is check your DVD player and region! And ask questions.",1503100800,,361,3.7012987012987013

5716926,5,B00CDV4NN4,"My favorite anime. I was a little worried about switching to the English dubs after watching season 1 in Japanese but after a few episodes, it was completely comfortable. The story is really well done and the characters are all lovable in their own way. It is super family friendly (unlike several other good animes) and we all watch it together when a new disk arrives. We've all taken to Fairy Tail so much that the entire family cosplays at local conventions.",1441497600,5,462,4.646341463414634

5716941,5,B00CDV4NN4,"The Fairy Tail series is one of my all time favorites.  It is nearly nonstop unadulterated awesomeness.  There is action, emotion, excitement, great music, quality art, etc.  Everything that makes a great anime.  This is a shonen through and through, though. If you are into more mature anime, this probably isn't going to be your cup of tea.  If you like anime like: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece, you'll like this one.

The second collection contains one of the best arcs in the series in my opinion.  A good cast of characters is introduced in this collection.  It has a decent amount of character development, too.  I think this is better than the first collection, personally.  A must watch!",1424736000,,696,4.773109243697479

5716957,3,B00CDV4NN4,"Let me be clear on this before my critical nature takes over, collection 2 was good and enjoyable and all that, and if you're looking or a good anime show to get involved with, then Fairy Tail is definitely the place to be. But collection 2 just really can't compare with collection 1.

In collection 1 the action and character development felt relaxed and natural. I loved the character introductions and character arcs, especially Gray's, seeing as how he's favorite character (along with Erza), and I'm not going to lie, it brought me to tears more than once. Collection 2 on the other hand just isn't that good. Which is surprising, since the first half is devoted to Erza's backstory. The badguys just seem really random for the most part, and the action is really pretty lame.

SPOILER ALERT But the second half of the collection is mainly about Laxus betraying and starting to take over Fairy Tail, and his three followers act as his minions. None of those three have even been seen before, so that loses major points in my opinion. I honestly can't tell if I'm supposed to sympathize with Laxus or not.. They made the same problem with Erza's character arc. It's impossible to sympathize with anyone, (even the main charcters), and it really just came off as boring when compared to the first collection.

Don't get me wrong, collection two is still entertaining, but in the end I feel the cons overcome the pros. The badguys are one dimensional, the lessons learned by the goodguys don't last for more than episode they were exposed in (especially Erza's which are utter dumb). Bottom line, it's still entertaining, but not nearly as good as the first collection, and the characters are more boring, and the fights aren't as good. The Loke arc is abosutely awesome, and it reveals some more about Lucy and her character, but it really only lasts for 2 episodes.

If you liked Fairy Tail collection 1, then you'll probably enjoy collection 2. If you didn't like collection one,  then this isn't going to pen any new doors and you probably shouldn't buy it.",1413504000,,2064,4.722222222222222

""Tower of Heaven"" introduces the complex Jellal who is a major player in the events of Fairy Tail. ""Fighting Festival"" finally shows what Laxus is capable of. These arcs really help Fairy Tail show what it can do as a shonen anime and if that is your thing, you should check it out. For those of you who like intense fights, Natsu vs Jellal is the best fight the series has had thus far. So check it out, it's worth it!",1398556800,,522,4.336734693877551

I figured it was a one time error, put in the first disc of Collection 2 and the same thing happened no audio for trailer then my player shuts down. The Dvds work fine but I really got it for the blu-rays.

The Fairy Tail Collection Two set is a nice set. It comes with both blu ray and dvd which is something i really enjoy. The picture and sound quality are crystal clear on my tv. The discs hold well in the container so there is no worry of them coming loose and scratching up. It is the official funimation release. It comes with a jacket over the case which looks pleasant.

5716996,5,B00CDV4NN4,"wow, much anime.
24 episodes for 22$? that's less than a dollar per episode.
very generous. so affordable.
such value.

This is on blu-ray, so how is the quality?
Keep in mind, this season aired before the HD revolution went mainstream.
the episodes are in widescreen, however, obviously, they are an upscale.
that is not bad, per se, but you can expect a little bit of blurry-ness which is still better than watching DVD quality.

however, this includes both DVD and blu-ray so if you want to watch it on DVD instead, go ahead!

the story in this arc shows the beginning of the romance between grey and juvia, don't miss it!
it also revolves around natsu and gajeels rivalry.",1386806400,4,676,4.616666666666666
5716997,5,B00CDV4NN4,"If you are looking at buying Fairy Tail: collection Two, you already know that Fairy Tale is one of the best Anime series currently in production, and should be watched by anyone who appreciates a good story.

What you get in this pack is a double copy of the episodes listed, 1 set in DVD form, 1 set in Blu-Ray form.

I keep the Blu- Rays for myself, and loan or give out the DVD's to try and spread interest in Funimation products, who does an outstanding job!

What is missing, I would LOVE a digital download with this product.  I would LOVE to be able to download this series to my devices before a trip, or have them more easily accessible.

Story is great, Blu-Rays are good quality... Give out the DVD's... Still want digital copy to come with the package... GO FUNIMATION! I CHOOSE YOU!",1384819200,18,796,4.387755102040816

I bought this looking to expland my Blu-ray HD collection.  Blu-ray upscaled SD to ""HD"" is useless to me since I already have a DVD player that upscales to 1080p resolution.

Its not completely worthless considering they don't have the DVD collection (just the combo), but when I buy a Blu-ray I expect native HD.  I consider this a bait and switch.  They baited with native HD anime and gave me SD anime upscaled into 1080p.",1378944000,5,552,4.525252525252525

just in this dub i don't get the familiar.. like feeling of connection. that and watching fullmetal alchemist and having todd voice ling, being a such a funny character. he has a great voice haha..
