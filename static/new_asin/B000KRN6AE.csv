2697069,5,B000KRN6AE,I saw the Foo Fighters live show from Wembly Stadium on Axis Television a few months ago. I've been following their current 8 - part series on HBO. I really love this hard working band lead by  Dave Grohl a great musician who got his start with Nirvana playing drums. After Nirvana's un timely demise  Dave Grohl put together some songs and used the name Foo Fighters which stuck and a new band busted out from the ashes of Nirvana. Foo Fighters live from Hyde Park is a DVD that you might and should add to your collection. The show is raw gritty and amazing. RG,1416960000,,563,4.30188679245283
2697070,5,B000KRN6AE,"This show is phenomenal. The Wembley show is great and any fan of rock & roll music needs to own it. But the Hyde Park '06 performance might even be better. The Foo Fighters' performance here was relentless and played with an infinite supply of energy, even more-so than they're usually known for. Raw energy.

All of the Foo Fighters' DVD/BD releases have their own reasons to be owned and it's hard to pick a favorite, but if you want raw power through the band's guitars, Hawkins' drumming, and Grohl's emotional vocals, you need to own this. Another thing... the crowd participation is very audible on certain songs and it adds a lot to the performance. It reminds you that the Foo Fighters have written some pretty anthemic stuff. Check out about 2 min 30 sec into ""Best of You"" to see what I mean.

Plus... Lemmy, Roger Taylor, & Brian May. Shake Your Blood, We Will Rock You (instrumental), & Tie Your Mother Down (Hawkins on vocals). Enjoy!",1388793600,2,948,4.603550295857988
2697071,1,B000KRN6AE,"I bought this DVD about 4 years ago as the Foo Fighters are one of my favorite bands and I will buy about anything they put out. I have tried this DVD in about 4 or 5 different DVD players, in my Playstation 3, and in my Sony Blu Ray player and it will not play on any of them, I guess due to the region encoding.  I own at least 50 concert DVDs/Blu Rays including about 3 others from Foo Fighters and this is the only one I have had problems with.  I think it did play on my computer but I purchased it to play on my home theater systems instead of on the cpu.",1347494400,3,561,3.786324786324786

2697073,5,B000KRN6AE,"The Foo Fighters are just on fire in this show. 85,000 screaming fans packed this show which started at dusk, and got darker as the show went on. The songs sound great, the crowd was lively, and they just rocked. Great show, I've got in in my Tivo and watch it all the time.",1201564800,5,274,4.092592592592593

One hell of a show I must say. I watched this years ago on my computer so it's nice to have a hard copy even though I can only play it on my xbox.
