4509320,5,B004ZJHSYS,"This is such a great series. Richard Griffiths, Malcom Sinclair and Maggie Steed are terrific actors and work together beautifully here. I wish Bella Enahoro and Ashley Russell had stayed for the entire run, as they were great in their roles.  I am so sad this program is now over.

I love this series because there is no gore in it.  It is not loud or pounding or gory.  Isn't that nice.

All that aside, the dvd quality is NOT great in this last of the series, but maybe I just got a dud. The first dvd seems quite over-exposed and even with adjustments cannot be made to look good.  Also, the sound is muffled.  Very distressing when you have to turn on subtitles to understand one's own language!

LOVE this last set of shows, LOVE the entire series, but DISAPPOINTED in the dvd quality.",1314748800,5,791,4.406896551724138
4509321,3,B004ZJHSYS,"The stories and performances are on a par with the earlier series, but many of the episodes are ""washed out"" - it's as if the brightness setting is on high and there's little to no contrast.  It's either defective or a very poor quality production, but it does affect the viewing experience.  too bad...",1314144000,5,303,4.592592592592593
4509322,5,B004ZJHSYS,"From what I understand, season five (5) of ""Pie in the sky"" is the last season for this great British series.  After viewing Season five (5) of the series, the aforesaid fact saddens me a great deal because, per usual,  this season has loads of gorgeous food for me to salivate over, wonderful mysteries that kept me guessing ""who done it"" combined with loads of humor that kept me laughing out loud.

Season five (5) on three (3) discs with eight (8) episodes is superbly directed and acted.  Richard Griffiths as Henry Crabbe the proud and dedicated owner and chef of the restaurant ""Pie in the Sky ""plus being a very good detective solving heinous crimes is delightful in those dual roles in the series.  Maggie Steed, as his accountant wife is wonderful supplying many very funny moments especially when she gets in the middle of one of Crabbe's crime cases as she does in this splendid Series five (5).

After viewing Series five (5) of ""Pie in the Sky"" I know that I will sorely miss this program.  This season just reeked of good food, good mysteries and humor.

4509323,5,B004ZJHSYS,"Judge James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict-- Henry Crabbe's adventures come to an actual close in the final episode, written by series creator Andrew Payne. Even though it's one that lets viewers know that Henry Crabbe will still be making steak-and-kidney pies, it's a wrap-up anyone who's invested in the first four series will want to see.

Through it all, the conflicts with Fisher grow; the security jobs mean that Henry's sharp police instincts aren't generally wanted. This conflict provides a thread running through the last season--sometimes absurd, as in ""Squashed Tomatoes"" and ""Pork Pies,"" but more often dramatic. It gives Richard Griffiths one last chance to show that his food-loving character isn't a one-note joke. The one disappointment is that you don't get to see the same level of character development in the supporting cast, particularly Gary (Nicholas Lamont), whose alcoholism has been dealt with in previous seasons.

The picture and sound are decent for a '90s British TV series.

4509324,5,B004ZJHSYS,"The twist of discovering crimes while on mundane duty as security brings a fresh new plot concept. Perhaps season 5 of Pie in the Sky, the concluding season of this series, is the best of all. Goodbye to DI Henry Crabbe (Richard Griffiths) but not without a full season of tasty plot recipes. Viewers will not know from these episodes that season 6 did not happen (I wonder if the cast knew.)

Maggie Steed (`Clatterford') is back as wife Margaret and prominent in action for each episode. Malcolm Sinclair as ACC Fisher, always in Crabbe's face, never lets up. Nick Raggett (Henderson the veggie grower and kitchen help) as well as Nicholas Lamont (Chef Gary) return as well. Some new faces fit in so well they seem like regulars from the start.

All 8 episodes have SUBTITLES and multiple plots of crime and restaurant action. If you are new to ""Pie in the Sky,"" I'd really recommend beginning with Series One and then continuing through all 5. But it is NOT necessary, just sit back and enjoy the humor, detective work, characterization and interaction. The cast is like family.

1 SQUASHED TOMATOES: Begins with Henry ordered to head of the Public Duties Squad, or private security team. Help is not the former Cambridge, but now W.P.C. Morton (Mary Woodvine-`Space Precinct') and PC Guthrie (Derren Litten-`Perfect World') and fill the spots well for 7 episodes. Area residents target the new development Crabbe's crew must protect. Meanwhile, Henderson's Green Zebra tomatoes don't conform to gov. reg's. In the kitchen, Gary dislikes Nicola's replacement, Sally (Marsha Thomason-an early look at this big-yet-rising star).

2 UGLY CUSTOMERS: Crabbe's team must protect a jury of a fraud trial. Jury intimidation gets very confusing, and includes foreman Dunfries (Keith Barron-`Haggard'). A restaurant customer threatens a legal charge. Crabbe seems to be coming and going, as always.

3 PORK PIES: A meat factory & animal-rights investigation offers surprising Trubbs sausage stuffing facts. Rich widow Julia (Sheila Gish-`Highlander'), Margaret's friend, struts her stuff for a dishy young broke pilot (Julian Wadham-`Middlemarch'). 2 spicy plots for Crabbes to deal with. Watch this one with a banger (sausage) sandwich.

4 CUTTING THE MUSTARD: Henry's team looks for bullies at a boarding school. They discover something being made in the school chem. lab. Gary concocts his own compound in the Pie in the Sky kitchen. The mustard could go national. Both locations get spicy before all is spread in the open.

5 RETURN MATCH: Fisher wants Kirk, aka DC Thomson (Neil Stuke), ex-pro, playing for the police soccer team. But Kirk has a drink problem and is suspect in local crime. Crabbe's team finds much more to do than football.

6 THE APPRENTICE: Is a new teen kitchen help, $$ theft, and teen disappearance connected? Crabbe tracks Nicky to a violent gang. An evil female instigator of the gang is played by Kelly Reilly (`Poldark' `Sherlock Holmes'). Nicky gets new job training--this time with the police. You get to see a short but sweet ballet dance by twin little girls.

7 IN THE SMOKE: Mr/Mrs Crabbe holiday in an ex-cop's empty London flat. Margaret finds a packed suitcase, a phone message warning, and a corpse, while Henry finds a hiding killer. On the savory plot side, the restaurant temporary help comes in the form of a bickering spouse duo. Kevin (Benedict Sandiford-`Garrow's Law') is squabbling with wife Carol (Nicola Walker-`MI-5' `Touching Evil') causing Pie in the Sky ruckus.

8 SMELLING OF ROSES: Crabbe can't smell or taste. But something still doesn't smell right when fisher orders an investigation of a businessman. Why? For what?  Another HUGE steak and kidney pie is presented for your visual feast without a recipe, or smell-o-vision. It's criminal! And what will happen to the restaurant and staff for this final episode of this final season? I'll not SPOIL the fun.

It's is sad that history proves Pie in the Sky did not continue after this season. Sad, as all 5 seasons were quite enjoyable. Top notch, bully entertainment pastry! A different drama mix of crime mystery and food fun. Well worth owning, and a return to series one for a full 5-series repeat viewing. Entertainment as BIG as Crabbe's BELT.

4509328,5,B004ZJHSYS,"Was unable to see disc 3, episodes 7-8 because the disc was thin and in trying to remove it from the holder it cracked in half. This is the second time this has happened to me and I was not using undue force. All of Pie in the Sky series is delightful with an interesting cast of characters and ever changing script. Takes a little getting used to. I am just sorry I could not see the conclusion,",1411257600,,396,4.089743589743589
4509329,4,B004ZJHSYS,"As cop dramas go, PIE IN THE SKY has a unique premise. The portly Richard Griffiths as a want-to-be-retired police inspector whose great passion in life is operating his restaurant, named Pie In The Sky. Forced to stay active in the service to appease his incompetent superior, Griffiths as Henry Crabbe is a joy to watch as he struggles to balance his professional obligations with his preferred vocation.

By Series Five, the last in the collection, the producers seem to be more concerned with enjoying the characters interactions rather than serving up a good plot. This is OK as the characters are fun, but there is a definite sense that the series is winding down.

This is cop drama light, but it is good light, like a souffl might be instead of a heavy meal. Sometimes thats exactly what you need.

Actually the scenes involving food are most enjoyable and clearly the producers have taken real delight in this important aspect of the show. Crabbes disgust at others (including his wifes) lack of appreciation for fine food is an ongoing theme that never runs out of steam. One can easily imagine the cast sitting around and enjoying the delicious meals in between scenes. The caterers mustve been especially good having to live up to the high standard set in Crabbes fictional restaurant.

Fans of the show will love the resolution to the series which plays out quite naturally in the final episode. This is a gentle series. Still a cop show, to be sure, but with little violence and a lot of time taken to savour the characters as well as the food.

PIE IN THE SKY definitely hits the spot.",1397433600,,1600,4.679715302491103

We own the entire series and are sad that season 5 is the last of it. Richard Griffiths, whom sadly most people only know as the mean uncle on Harry Potter, is a delight. He also was in the film ""History Boys"". The man is talented with many layers to his portrayal of Inspector Henry Crabbe. He passed away this past winter and we shall miss him and his work. The supporting players in this series have roles that you come to love and want to follow as well. It is easy to see why the series was such an hit in Britain. I encourage you to consider buying season 1 and then adding each one. It will be one you will watch again and again.",1367539200,2,785,4.006369426751593

Which brings me to the sole negative point - we purchased the discs the day they were released, and just recently got to the third disk, which turned out to be damaged. We are a couple weeks beyond the return period, so we will be buying a second set to get the last disk.

Check the disks when you get them!  Four stars only for issues with the physical media.",1316217600,3,516,4.079207920792079
4509343,5,B004ZJHSYS,"I had the opportunity to watch a few of the individual ""Pie In The Sky"" programs on a local PBS station around 2006 or 2007, and was looking for some more.  It took until a couple of years or so ago for the first series to be available in the U.S. on DVD.  Over the next few years all the series - except for this one, Series 5 were available from Acorn.  Now that Series 5 is available, I can honestly say the whole project, from Series 1 to Series 5 was consistently well-above-average.  The writing always made the ensemble characters, even when the cast members changed, worth viewing and understanding.  ""Pie In The Sky"" seldom had a lot of action, but the stories were worth watching because of the characters.  I'm as pleased with Series 5 as I was with the first four.",1315958400,7,776,4.354166666666667

He is kept from totally retiring by his boss who realizes that the chef/cop's (Henry Crabbe)case closure numbers make him look good.  As a result, Crabbe is forced to split his time between his cop job and his chef job. The viewer comes to know both Henry's police co-workers and his restaurant's staff.  Both of these groups are played by strong supporting casts that one comes to love as much as Henry Crabbe.  If you have not yet seen the series, I would recommend starting with season 1.

Henry Crabbe, DI and chef, is a kind, honest, truth-seeking individual with a very big, kind heart.  You see this in each episode.  The mysteries/detecting are not deep nor involved but satisfying in their conclusions.  The real heart of this wonderful series lies with the characters and within Chef Crabbe's kitchen.
