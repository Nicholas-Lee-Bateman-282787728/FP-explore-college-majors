8324387,1,6305701334,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. They claim ""beatifully animated and delightfully told-hours of entertainment!""The animation is sure nice, but the language is not what I would call ""delightful"". To my biggest shock every second word in this Children's (!) movie is ""stupid"". One wonders how the filmmakers talk to their children at home. My 5 year old son loved the movie, but I had to tell him that this was the first and last time that he watched it, because this language is just not aceptable.

I would not advise anybody, who cares about how their children speak to buy this DVD. I will not buy more from this series.",1169078400,,627,4.598214285714286
