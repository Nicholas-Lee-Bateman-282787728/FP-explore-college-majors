8748975,5,B00AOURDV0,"I very much enjoyed Amalfi Excursion by Virtual Walk. I got it because it was a similar location to some that I visited but needed more time to enjoy. I had wanted to experience walking the island, briefly visiting the little villages. The Amalfi Excursion allowed me to do that while on my treadmill or elliptical machine. You can enjoy a description with a travel guide or just natural sounds. There is also music if you prefer. I very much enjoyed the description of what we were passing. Otherwise I think I would have missed out on some of it, not knowing what it was, as is typical on real-life travel excursions. I'm going to see if I can find similar videos for some of the islands and locations that I did visit in real life, but didn't get to spend as much time as I would have liked. The exercise benefits are excellent as well. The exercise stays at a good level because there is lots of climbing. The time just seemed to fly by. This is a good one to view over and over again.",1384732800,2,989,4.294117647058823
