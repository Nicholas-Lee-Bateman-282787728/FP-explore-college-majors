5050608,5,B0072HTWQM,"Appealing to nearly 2 million weekly viewers, The Bridge (Swedish - Bron) (Danish - Broen) aired in the autumn of 2011 every Wednesday night at 8pm in Denmark and 9pm in Sweden. Danish network DR screened episodes a week after their Swedish SVT counterparts before the Danes caught up by screening a double episode to conclude on the same night as SVT.
The Bridge is probably best described as a mixture of three recent popular Scandinavian acquisitions on UK television, Wallander, The Killing and Those Who Kill. Considering that all three of these series along with Danish political drama Borgen are all set within an hours journey of each other in the resund/resund (S/D) region, The Bridge should have something to appeal to fans of all Nordic series.
Unlike the other Danish shows, you won't find many actors from the other programmes here with the exception of the lead male Danish policeman played by Kim Bodnia (guest appearances in The Killing 1 and Those Who Kill) and a very brief appearance by Nicolaj Kopernikus (Vagn - The Killing 1) as the father of a hospital patient.
The discovery of a body at the exact halfway point of the Oresund Bridge leads to the arrival of the Copenhagen and Malm police forces who decide to work together to unravel the mystery. The finding on the bridge is actually the top half of a prominent Swedish politician and the bottom half of a Danish prostitute. This discovery is only the start for a chain of events which test the resolve of Martin (Bodnia) and Saga (Sofia Helin).
Both countries opted to stay out of the euro so we see Martin have to borrow some Swedish kronor from Saga while in Sweden. We also learn that as a Danish cop in Sweden, Martin is not allowed to be armed. To be fair although they both speak similar closely related languages and can understand each other nearly 100%, we learn that both Sweden and Denmark are more similar than both characters would think.
The production appears to be more Swedish than Danish through my eyes and more of the scenes take place in Sweden's third biggest city than in the Danish capital. That's not to say that all is quiet in Copenhagen - police corruption, riots, the killing of an immigrant, we also see how solid the marriage of our Danish cop is. Crossing the bridge we have a very different policewoman who is quite unlike any policewoman seen before on TV. When we see Saga out of business hours is when we discover the real lady and learn about how she became the way she is today. As with other Scandinavian series we are exposed to alot of character background which makes this a very solid drama.
Although DR and SVT are involved in the making of the series, independent production companies are involved too. As is standard with most DR dramas, each episode of this ten part series is around 58 minutes long and each hour spent watching this will fly by. This is certainly better than the vast majority of BBC and ITV drama output and Five and Sky's acquisitions from the US.
Apparently a second series has already been commissioned which is definitely something to look forward to. In the meantime I'm going to try some Danish drama set in the Fifties&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Better-Times-Krniken-Krnikan-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-0-Import-Denmark/dp/B0018U8832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Better Times ( Krniken ) ( Krnikan ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 0 Import - Denmark </a>].",1332806400,3,3445,4.920962199312715
5050639,5,B0072HTWQM,"I wasn't sure if I would like this having English subtitles, but this is one of the best series I've ever seen in my life.  Saga is so focused on her job she has no social skills at all, but it keeps the show from being boring!  The whole team works well with each other.  This was SO good, I got the second season and I am awaiting the third. What I like best is that there is very little swearing.  Hollywood over does the language so reading an English subtitle is better to me!  There is no Hollywood sensationalism, but The Bridge is a sensation all its' own!  I have gotten all three seasons of The Bridge and love everyone of them.  Don't be fooled by other ""The Bridge"" movies.

5050641,5,B0072HTWQM,The Bridge is one of the best police shows ever. In recent years only the US The Wire and France's Spiral are in my opinion better. A body is found on the bridge which connects Sweden to Denmark. Whats more it is at the centre of the bridge half in each of the two countries. A detective from Malmo in Sweden and one from Copenhagen in Denmark are paired together to solve the crime. They are an odd couple Saga has mental health problems she is unable to tell a lie even if telling a lie is the kind thing to do. She is blunt to the point of rudeness with no regard for the social norms and sees nothing wrong in changing her shirt in a squadron full of male police officers. At least she has bra on underneath. Martin is more wordily married and divorced a few times he gives the impression that he does not take his work to seriously and struggles with Saga's  behaviour. She sometimes takes his advice knowing that others find her behaviour strange. Martin is of course despite his more relaxed attitude a dam good cop.. This show is out of the top drawer and the good news is that seasons 1 and 2 are just as good and maybe even better.,1501372800,,1141,4.210045662100456

5050643,5,B0072HTWQM,"Read an article on the internet BBC news and culture site, which specifically referenced this tv series in connection with its overview of Malmo in Sweden, and was hooked. Wanted to know more, especially since Scandinavia seems to be en vogue at the moment, and have seen bits and pieces of other exports from that part of the world, along with a few of the hot actor/actresses/directors on the scene that hail from the various countries. It doesn't hurt that in some ways, this is reminiscent of the also voguish sociopath-like characters that entire series are being built around now: 'Sherlock', 'Dexter', and 'Elementary' to name the hottest ones in the media these last few years, and the many movies that also feature ambiguous psychological characterizations that suggest psychological pathology vs autism vs artificial intelligence. It doesn't take long to become intrigued by the main character Saga in this first season of 'The Bridge', and then to find yourself fully engaged in not only the storyline but the ancillary characters, and with only ten episodes of approximately 55 minutes each, the last scene from the last episode definitely leaves you wanting more. It is telling that this one Swedish/Danish series, which gets its name from the Oresund Bridge that connects Copenhagen, Denmark to Malmo, Sweden, has been remade several times over--relocated to other locales and with other foreign actors in these various other countries. I have not seen the other remade versions, but from fan postings, none so far can compare with this original 'Bridge'. Definitely 'Must See TV'.",1496275200,4,1595,5.162162162162162

I wish it was dubbed in English as well as having subtitles because unless you can speak Swedish (I can't), some of the nuance is lost.

5050679,5,B0072HTWQM,"This moody, strikingly photographed mystery program is anchored by the brilliant, funny, ultimately touching performance of Sofia Helin as autistic Swedish homicide investigator Saga Noren of the Malmo County Police. When a dismembered body is discovered straddling the border between Denmark and Sweden, she is forced to team with a rumpled, morally flawed Danish detective to solve the murders. A series of even more bizarre crimes follows, and the two scramble to stop the killer, while dealing with domestic problems. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, but the mystery is ultimately unsatisfying. The Hannibal Lector/Jo Nesbo style villain was a let down for me. These calculating loonies who can seem to do anything (reprogram a car, hack into police computers, steal identities) and anticipate any counter move are a cliche by now. It also seems hard to believe that such a rage filled person could plan for five years without killing. The killer's ultimate motivation is a letdown, calling into question everything that came before. At the end, some characters simply disappear from the story, and, most disturbing, the script requires the Danish detective to be clueless at just the right moment to move the plot forward.

So why the five stars? Because the characters are so much fun, and until it starts throwing curves towards the end, the mystery is compelling and suspenseful, leavened with humor as Saga navigates the bewildering world of normal human relations.",1470182400,,1481,5.196652719665272

5050682,2,B0072HTWQM,"Season 1 is a sleazy potboiler that portrays police detectives as promiscuous, obsessive-compulsive, vengeful, and shallow.  The script's wider frame of reference blames a stereotypically-drawn godless Norwegian middle class for all that ails Norwegian society.  The audience is led to believe that only the de-classe young female detective Saga who eschews civility can save Sweden from its insidious depravity.  Subsequent seasons will no doubt follow Saga's passionate pursuit of her defined-benefit pension.  I'll be skipping subsequent seasons.  Might read Sartre's NAUSEA instead; surely, it depicts the absurd more adroitly than ten episodes of sex, violence, and dinner reservations in Copenhagen.",1470182400,2,705,6.01

5050693,5,B0072HTWQM,"I approached the series with some trepidation; I am not fond of overt violence or sex; but I love a good mystery. One gets  jolted early when the body actually turns out to be two. Long shots for extreme gruesome scenes and that works throughout the first 10 episodes. Sex is restrained and somehow a couple of nude scenes although natural but seem superfluous. The side characters step in and out: and there is no compromise: it is not a sugar laden soap opera. Now the mystery part is brilliant and one has no chance to think it through. The suspense is relentless and piles up. Very deliberate fast pacing, otherwise the inherent weakness of the plot would show (how can a person without help carry out such far reaching crimes, no matter how well trained -FBI is mentioned?
But what lifts it out of the ordinary and hence the five stars are actually the stars themselves. Sofia Helin, is just about outstanding as Saga Noren, the Swedish detective. Everyone who works with her knows she is odd. But how odd? You have to see to believe it. She may or may not have Asperger's spectrum, but she deals with reality, with rules and regulations, and statistical knowledge at her finger tips. She is emotionally blunted and as the Danish Detective whose role is complicated and essential to the plot, Martin, points this out, she tries to change. Her first attempt at 'just gossiping' is outrageously funny. The events leading up to the climax are like a logical Sherlock Holmes story; and the bang up ending, in which Saga plays the central part is . . . like the rest of the series: great.",1453766400,5,1588,4.591549295774648

5050695,5,B0072HTWQM,"Okay, I think I like Spiral a tiny bit more but this is also very good.  I didn't understand how some characters fit in at first but eventually it falls into place.  The reason I liked it was that although it pushes realism a little more as it pertains to the perpetrators, it can then come back and be more realistic in its portrayal of relationships.  The main characters are great actors as are the supporting characters so I would definitely recommend this series.",1453680000,2,468,4.5476190476190474
5050696,5,B0072HTWQM,"I must confess I'm only halfway through the first season. But so far I am a fan. Having a female hero with some form of Asperger's is handled well - intrinsic to the story and not a stunt, as it could have been in a typical TV show. I saw a review somewhere that said this was like the first season of the Swedish Wallander. First, understand that season was a 9/10, and season two is a disappointing "":OK"": 6.6/10. Yes The Bridge is reminiscent - same quirky, sharp narrative. Kind of like we Bergman would have made if he was doing TV today, and could focus better.

The Bridge is moody, existential and upbeat at the same time. Maybe that's Zen. Very intriguing. Draws one in to an energetic Nordic solitude thing. I love it!",1453507200,4,728,4.352941176470588

5050698,5,B0072HTWQM,"This series is totally entertaining. This genre has certainly been put through it's paces, but The Bridge is refreshingly original.
 The two detectives are definitely flawed. Swedish Saga is a brilliant detective, a straight arrow, all situations are black or white and she sees no shades of grey. Danish Martin is a little less by the book, more compassionate but more hotheaded. Combining their strengths they search for a vengeful serial killer. The killer is beyond diabolical.

5050714,5,B0072HTWQM,"The resund Bridge, which flows from Copenhagen in Denmark to Malm in Sweden, is the longest bridge in Europe. Denmark and Sweden are good neighbors and this friendship can be seen in this concrete bridge.

'The Bridge', a series made for TV by the Danish is quite a production. I have viewed the U.S. Version, and though it was good, the Danish version is spectacular. This ten episode series held me on edge for every episode. The main protagonists, Saga Norn, played by Sofia Helin, is a Detective in the Malm Police Department, and her counterpoint, Martin Rohde, played by Kim Bodnia, is. Detective in the Copenhagen department. Each if these characters bring a breadth of fresh air, but it is Saga, who is on the Asperger's syndrome, who is the most fun. She tel,s the truth, has not learned the social norms, and marches to her own drummer. She is intelligent, and she is the best detective in Malm. Her colleagues call her 'odd'. Martin, is slovely dressed man, a little overweight, with a charming grin. married three times with five children by different mothers. Many affairs, it seems, and his current marriage is iffy. These two, however, work very well together. Martin teaches Saga about social skills, Saga teaches Martin how to tell the truth and how to be a good detective. This couple completely different, but good together as detectives. No romance in this series between the two.

A body of a woman is found in the middle of the bridge spanning Denmark and Sweden. Thus both countries have the law involved. The woman is cut in half, the upper half in Sweden, the lower half in Denmark.  Thus begins one of the most convoluted series in television. It is mind blowing, so well written and acted, that it us difficult not to continue watching.

The series has ten episodes, each almost an hour long. The scenes of Malm and Copenhagen are beautiful. The bridge is also beautiful, and it makes a visit to the Oresund Bridge a must see. This is one of the top ten best series for me. A chuckle at times, but tense anxiety the rest.

5050715,4,B0072HTWQM,"This is the original Scandinavian Detective/Mystery series, which has since been emulated to superior effect by the American series, The Bridge.
Basic plot centers on cooperation between Sweden and Denmark in solving a strange murder case.  As investigation ensues, others are murdered.  It is, of course, the investigators' mission to solve the mystery and apprehend the murderer.  This unraveling makes for an entertaining plot.

The principal actor is a woman who is slightly autistic (Aspergers?).  She interprets literally others' wry, ironic comments.  She also lacks the interpersonal sensitivity to know when she should be quiet or how to respond tactfully to others's pain and discomforting moments.  She easily offends others and is often interpersonally rescued by her detective partner.  She is also an open book, saying and doing whatever comes to mind (or body), which also makes for disarming scenes.  There are two principal actors, the partners investigating the murders.

The plot is convoluted and not all that clearly unraveled, which is one of the reasons I give it four rather than five stars.

The supporting cast is good, but not celebratory.  In fact, many of them are placid and uncomplicated, which might facilitate actual detective work, but which makes for less interesting viewing.

The American series is actually much better than the Scandinavian series.  The American series has the same basic plot, detectives from two different countries (Mexico and the U.S.) collaborating in solving murder mysteries.  The American version is, however, better in almost every respect:  The plot is more complicated but easily understood, the supporting cast is excellent, and their roles so entertained that there are several interesting, provocative subplots.  I highly recommend the American series over the Scandinavian one.  Viewing both gives one an opportunity to contrast two presentations on essentially the same plot.  This comparison could be used to good effect in a film class.",1440201600,,2009,5.44336569579288

I could watch her all day long. The first episodes are very enthralling indeed, as a genius serial killer is on the loose in Copenhagen and Malmo. What the guy (assuming it's a guy) gets away with is amazing; the way he stays ten steps ahead of the cops remarkable. This criminal is like Moriarty reborn, or something along those lines.

A story like this needs a brilliant payoff, and my wife and I were looking forward to one. But when the payoff came, our reaction was this: He/she did all this incredible criminal planning and execution to prove what point? Why would anyone go to all this trouble to perform such a simple act of revenge?

5050747,2,B0072HTWQM,"Danish films have traditionally been intense, both in their hand-held filming technique (their outstanding film, The Celebration, started it all), but this series is a bit of a disappointment.  At times, you want to give this film four stars and at others (especially during the last two hours), you want to give this film a mere one star.  The Americanized Fox version will follow this same theme and one can only hope that it's ending veers in a different direction, one that is satisfying, especially after a ten-hour stretch.  So first off, yes, this is ten hours of one case, the bridge being the common theme bringing both the Swedish and Danish police together, which is unusual in those countries, their policies and methods of handling a case quite different from each other (the script was read by both police departments and the differences were approved as truthful).  A body is found on the bridge, one placed exactly on the border line, only the body turns out (quick but small spoiler) not one but two people.  From this point, the main Swedish investigator, Saga Noren, butts heads with Martin from the Danish side, a carefree but dedicated investigator who has more than a few skeletons in his closet.  Saga, dealing with something similar to Aspergers, is quite able to function within the police department but does so rather bluntly and without fearing the reactions her comments bring.  This pairing goes well, the two styles lending their own observations in the case, as lead after lead goes dry.  Which leads to the second point which is that by the end of the ten hours, you'll begin to look back and realize that somewhat like a bad book, the leads that kept you so glued to the screen throughout each episode --the corporations, the affairs, the poisonings, the homeless-- actually have almost nothing to do with the story.  At the time, you feel that you are actually getting somewhere, which is the point of the film, that many actual police cases spend time following a tip that ends up a dead end.  But by the final two hours, you begin to get a feeling that maybe you're going to be shortchanged, that they are indeed going to wrap this up and do so without satisfaction.  The super-smart villain has suddenly turned a bit dumb and then just as suddenly, it's over.  Ten hours, you think, what you could have done with that time.  Admittedly, the acting is quite good, the film starkly dull in color, something purposely done to create the brooding atmosphere (the scenery pretty much stays the same so don't expect a travelogue here).  And once again, few people smile as if to add to the dreary mood (no wonder the nightclub scenes are so full of loud music and drinking and drugs, as if the few hours of escape make up for the return to an unwelcome reality).  All in all, perhaps watch the first disc of three episodes and see if this series is for you.  It will definitely grab you; but like a beautiful exploding fireworks display, the different sparkles fade quickly and soon you are back to a dark sky, thrilled for a brief time, but forced to return to reality.  Was it all worth it?...that will be up to you to decide.",1418515200,4,3160,4.644524236983842

If you can handle subtitles, THE BRIDGE is likely one of the finest cop tales you will ever see.

5050791,5,B0072HTWQM,"A number of outstanding programs from Denmark and Sweden have become available in North America over the past few years. Shows like Wallander and The Killing have been enormous hits, to the point where they have been re-made in either England or the U.S. This is understandable as many viewers just don't like subtitles. Accessibility is what it's all about in the film business. Appeal to as wide an audience as possible.

But for this reviewer, there is nothing like the original. Having recently enjoyed a number of European programs, many made available here in North America by a company called MHz Networks, who specialize in such programming, I've become hooked, waiting for that next great show to come along. After Borgen, the three season political masterpiece that came out of Denmark just a few years ago, it's been both fun to anticipate what that show might be and frustrating to watch shows that, while good, aren't quite up to the high standard set by Borgen.

Well, THE BRIDGE comes awfully close to being that elusive next masterpiece. A co-production between Sweden and Denmark, this ten-part police procedural derives a lot of its dramatic power by setting the first murder at the precise point on the Oresund Bridge that divides Denmark from Sweden. Who is in charge is the first obvious question asked. The answer, both countries. While most of the office scenes are set in Sweden, with Saga Noren (played by Sofia Helin), the leading homicide detective in the Swedish city of Malmo apparently in control of the investigation, the Danish presence is more than adequately represented by Martin Rohde (played by Kim Bodnia) Copenhagen's leading homicide detective.

As good as the plot is, and as thrilling as some heart-stopping moments are, the real thrust of the series is the interaction between the socially inept, cut-to-the-bone truthfulness of Saga and the more laid-back, family man Martin. As radically different as they are from one another, Saga and Martin are by no means one dimensional characters and their life decisions, their values and their ability to separate blatant truth from, at times, more appropriately sensitive responses, is one of the most compulsively watchable aspects of THE BRIDGE. The title of the show also comes to stand as a metaphor for how these two characters will bridge their differences and learn to work together.

The style and look of the series is also important to note. Lovers of old films continue to watch Film Noir with the sort of veneration the best of that genre deserves. Where are the heirs apparent today? Right here in shows like THE BRIDGE, which is mostly shot at night and carries with it a gloom and oppression that seems inescapable, all basic qualities of Film Noir.

There is a lot of darkness in ten hours of relentless murder investigation. Be warned that the show's world view isn't exactly life affirming. But it is not a world without hope. Central to that hope is the idea that a healthy domestic relationship is the most important aspect of life. While many of us might say there is a little more to living than that, important as such things are, in the dramatic world of THE BRIDGE, this is most appropriate, at least for now. Relational respite from the worries of the world are high stakes indeed.

Apparently, season two of THE BRIDGE has been produced and a third is being written. Maybe the characters' respective world views will mature and grow...

Meantime, don't be put off by the subtitles. THE BRIDGE is worth the time and effort.",1403913600,8,3537,4.885

reason for the four stars....the middle episodes chased leads, and while interesting, did little to move the main story arc along... that said, it was still a excellent ride.

Spoiler alert!
The (unseen, until the end) killer suffered a ruined marriage - he lost his wife and son in a car accident, lost his job - he has lost everything that he thought he could count.

He blames ex partner and once best friend for ruining his life, his marriage - for the loss of his wife and son in a car accident, and his career as a policeman.  He fakes his own death.  He has plastic surgery and reinvents himself and plans a very complicated plot for revenge, over many, many years.

Anyway, as the two leads chase the main villain, there is a moment in Episode 9 where Saga does something so foolish, it almost ruined the series for me. I hate when a villain succeeds in doing something not because he or she's so clever but because our protagonist does something no trained police officer would do.

Her male counterpart is a charming flawed hero. The central story gets much more attention in this version, but the subplots are fascinating.

5050814,5,B0072HTWQM,"This series was a brilliant piece of television to rival The Killing with the added dimension of the humour injected into the relationship between the two lead investigators due to the Saga characters only marginally developed social skills.  As in The Killing there is one male and one female lead although, as also in The Killing, the female lead investigator is the more naturally talented while the weaknesses and foibles of the male are all too clearly on show.

A series of seemingly conscience driven murders occur the first of which is that of a Swedish politician, whose body is found straggling the border between Sweden and Denmark on the Oresund bridge, which joins the two.  It seems to be the murderers aim to highlight various social ills afflicting society and (s)he chooses a somewhat ironic way of achieving it: e.g. the plight of the homeless is drawn attention to by the murder of various vagrants!  The fact that the politicians body is found half in Sweden and half in Denmark means that the police forces of both countries are forced to cooperate in solving the crime.  Thus we have the Swedish Saga teamed with the Danish Martin, which sets the scene for a whole series of usually humorous misunderstandings of a social and sometimes sexual nature!

This is not the only source of enjoyment:  the acting is uniformly excellent and it looks great and is often visually stunning  the English language remake, The Tunnel is far more drab!

Once you get the hang of reading subtitles it gets easier and easier to watch the film and only focus on the words out of the corner of your eye. And this 'skill' just opens up a whole world of amazing films/TV shows you can't see on american TV. In fact if you do what I finally did and get a multi region DVD player you can reward yourself with ALL kinds of great cop shows available at Amazon.co.uk not possible to watch on US DVD players.

This wonderful, intense, far fetched at times, cop show has 2 partners with totally different personalities and you come to have great affection for both of them by the end of the show. Season 2 is being released on Amazon.uk in Feb and I can't wait to see it.",1388534400,3,976,4.219251336898396

because halves of different corpses are found on the bridge between sweden and Denmark, a police detective from each country is assigned to catch the serial killer responsible.  this killer is especially drawing attention to socioeconomic class inequities with the victims.

the woman detective is beautiful but wholly without people skills because she has asperger's.  she is very good at her job but tends to offend everyone.  the male detective is her opposite and has been so engaging as to attract more than one wife and have children from all.

this series was remade in English language in the USA by placing the story on the bridge between Mexico and Texas, with a detective from each. I've watched the opening episode of the remake and it is following the original verbatim except for the regional differences.  both series are titled THE BRIDGE.

That being said, I'd heard phenomenal things about the show, and seeing FX had picked up a US made redo, I wanted to judge all the hype.  Well, it's well deserved.  I was sucked in almost immediately, and had watched the ten episode first season in two days.  I did not purchase from Amazon or an Amazon seller, but got my copy used through a US  eBay seller.  I had no problems playing the show subtitled in English (another reviewer mentioned problems with his/her copy not being subtitled).

The show is gritty, cold, well scripted, well acted, and I'm craving season two.  FX has done a great job with some recent shows, so I'm crossing my fingers they do The Bridge justice.

The story is just a sick idea that some sick person dreamed up. And because the basis of this plot is what the episodes unfold the entire show is just absurd.

5050863,3,B0072HTWQM,"If you value your tense denouements don't read this.

I liked the series very much, except:
except for the last reel, in which the 18 year-old boy we've gotten to know and love is brutally, sadistically tied up and put into a box and boarded up in the killer's house where he suffocates to death.

We have signed on to a murder mystery, in which the murder(s) typically occur at the beginning and the detectives work puzzles finding the murderer(s). Usually a loved character is not found murdered in the last scene.

I was left bummed out, depressed for more than two days. That's why this warning: get your defenses up.

I cannot speculate why the writers did this to us, showing extreme suffering, then the loss of someone we'd grown to like a lot (the Danish detective's son). I won't even try. But, I object. Traumatizing your audience -- in an otherwise good story* -- should not be allowed.

*There were several, notably one in particular, red herrings, such as the strangestrange man Anya, the runway, stays with, which, I thought, were NOT integrated into the plot but left too many questions. The new characters came on as if they were new stories entirely. Earlier main characters just fall away. As they do in real life?

The characters, Martin and the Aspergersish  Saga, are consistent, and interesting.

I was looking forward to series 2 but, if they are going to treat us this way, killing a character without even any scenes or time taken for a funeral, to see the effects on his whole family, to give them and us rituals for mourning, is cold. Rather like the detective Saga. The father cries, then thinks about something else and smiles. Bunk.",1365033600,2,1662,4.667808219178082

However, having seen only the BBC version with subtitles. I was dismayed that certain key facets and details of the story were not  adequately clarified;Incidents happened and are developed but not explained (perhaps the Swedish/Danish versions are more complete ),i.e.,but why was  one of the detectives in certain houses or sites in the first place? The reliance by the main characters on their intuition without giving comment is important in the unravelling of the main story. A number of ""contrived ""coincidences weakened the piece at crucial turning points. The final hour of the series seemed  padded---the final resolution could have been incorporated easily earlier on.

Also, since this is a Region B blu ray disc you may run into issues playing it on your player.

At the time of writing this review the product has yet to be released, and my review is based on the airing of the series on BBC4 from the UK.

The Title of this latest offering from Scandinavia refers to Oresund Bridge, which connects Copenhagen with the southern Swedish city of Malm&ouml;. The opening sequence sees the `staging' of a female body on Oresund, where one-half is literally within Swedish borders while the other lies within Danish borders.

Our two main protagonists in the Bridge Rohde (Danish Cop) and Nor&eacute;n (Swedish) team up against a self-righteous serial killer drawing attention to the ways in which the two countries' governments seem to neglect the poor and needy. He attaches notes to the corpses saying things such as: ""Had there been no victims, you would have found no victims."" A thoroughly engaging police drama and well worth a look. There are other side stories that seem to have no connection with the main theme, but this viewer thinks that as the series progresses we will see a convergence of plot threads.

To the main two protagonists then:We have Nor&eacute;n Saga (female Swedish Police officer) when it comes to police procedures she is professional and very competent. As soon as it comes to interacting with other people, she's lost and lacks any social skills. There is a hysterical scene in which she tries to chat up a man in a bar, displaying a pulling technique that makes The Inbetweeners look polished by comparison. Although not directly implied it is clear she has a form of Asperger's.

While Martin Rohde (our laid-back Danish Police officer). He has a slightly alarming habit of massaging his groin area - but has the excuse of having just undergone a vasectomy. From a recent news article apparently Martin fulfils the national stereotype, as perceived by Swedes of Danes, he's had a lot of wives, he drinks a little too much, and he's not taking care of himself."" While Ms Saga, is seen as an odd, but stereotypical Swede, as perceived by Danes. Martin Rohde has to tread carefully in more ways than one, as he is obliged to team up with his Swedish detective Saga Nor&eacute;n (Sofia Helin), a woman gifted with all the logical braininess of Mr Spock but with even fewer people skills. Her wide-eyed accidental rudeness quickly becomes an icing on the cake for this series. A great series that leaves us a quirky narrative and funny too boot. Not to be missed another fine offering from our Scandinavian neighbours. Please do not put off by the subtitles.

Sofia Helin steals the show with her amazing performance as the brilliant, dedicated, and autistic (Asperger's) Swedish detective Saga Noren. Her Danish counterpart is in many ways her opposite, but they learn to work together. They help each other to identify and capture diabolical criminals, and also to overcome their serious personal problems. There are many underlying themes of this show, including international cooperation, social isolation, fighting terrorism, and the meaning of friendship.

This original version of Bron/Broen (The Bridge) was so good it inspired several other remakes in other languages.  The US version just didn't work for me and I think it was because the character that Sofia Helin created in this original version was what made this series so good.
Sofia Helin brilliantly portrays a functional person with a mental condition but the series leaves it to the viewer to guess it's aspergers. It shows her struggle to deal with her other detective coworkers when she can't really feel emotion.

The murder crimes are dark.  She is their best detective.  When she has to sensitively deal with victims next of kin she fails miserably in
an almost humorous fashion.  It's like Monk but only in concept. Not in the approach.

She is forced to work with a detective from Denmark.  He likewise does not want the partnership.  But they grow to be friends
and they change each other.  In this sense it is a lot like the two detectives in The Heat Of The Night(the movie).

My only complaint is there are many pretty blonde female characters in this show.  Sometimes I get confused as to who's who.  It's easier for us gentle viewers to keep track of the characters when casting directors choose actors who do not look alike.  I guess that's hard to do when there are so many beautiful blonde actresses in Sweden.  But why am I complaining about that?",1506384000,4,1437,4.646825396825397
