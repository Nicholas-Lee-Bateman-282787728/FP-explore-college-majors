5464990,5,B00APOQR4E,"This is a Danish, Swedish and Czech co production about the life of god old mad King Christian VII of Denmark. Set in the Eighteenth Century when he needs a bride and a suitable wife is found in the English court in the form of Welsh, Caroline Mathilde played beautifully by Alicia Vikander  (`Anna Kerenina'). When she arrives at court it doesn't take too long to realise that her betrothed is a bit of a cad. He has beastly table manners, rude as I don't know what and is as much fun in bed as a randy cockroach - so love was never going to blossom. But she manages to give him an heir anyway.

Meantime's the somewhat eccentric King goes on a tour, or progress, of Europe where he finds himself in dire need of a physician. Enter Dr. Johan Freidrich Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen - `Casino Royale') who is by all accounts a silver tongued charmer. But apart from that appendage he also has dangerous ideas in the new thinking department - yes he is part of the enlightenment movement that is sweeping across Europe. Ideas expounded and fuelled by the writings of Rousseau and Voltaire has meant a new imagination has taken hold and Queen Caroline is in for a bit of enlightening herself. So when the King decides she is too serious and that with the help of a physician she may improve her temper, Dr Struensee jumps at the chance like a school boy up for a game of conkers. What ensues is passion in the bedroom at court and intrigue that will set them on a collision course with all vested interests in Denmark.

This is a sumptuous production that gets right into the very fabric of the times and is as visually rewarding as entertaining from a plot perspective. The acting is effortless in its execution, so much so that you are swept along with the entire thing. This is a film where you just lap it up. The cinematography is just brilliant and everything seems understated by what is actually unfolding on the screen. Director Nikolaj Arcel (`The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' 2009) has taken a truly unique script and made something remarkable and all the more so because of the collaboration involved. It is in Danish, English, German and French with good sub titles even though they are all in white which causes a few problems but I managed fairly well and in no way irritating enough to detract from what is a great film experience truly exceptional.",1354752000,168,2359,4.519906323185012
5464991,4,B00APOQR4E,"""A Royal Affaire"" (2012 release from Denmark; 137 min.) brings the true story of Caroline Mathilda (played by Alicia Vikander), the English teenage princess who married King Christian VII of Denmark (played by Mikkel Flsgaard) in the early 1770s. Caroline's dreams of a fairy tale-like marriage are soon destroyed when it turns out that the King is utterly insane. After the royal couple's first child is born, Caroline becomes attracted to, and eventually becomes romantically involved with, the King's personal physician, Struensee (played by Mads Mikkelsen). As it happens, Struensee's role is much larger than just being the King's physician, as he has substantial influence over the King's political actions as well. Soon Struensee and Caroline are using the King as a pawn to advance their political ideas of freedom of speech and other such ""radical"" ideas. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, kudos to the producers who worked with a budget of 46 million Danish Krone (about US$ 8 million, mere peanuts in Hollywood terms) and bring us a grand scale historical drama, the likes of which we don't get to see made very often in Europe. The overall feeling of the movie is quite epic as a result. Second, also kudos to Mads Mikkelsen for his portrayal of the German physician Struensee, it is quite the tour-de-force.

This movie premiered at the 2012 Berlin Film Festival, to great acclaim, and rightfully so. I saw this movie on a recent home visit to Belgium, and the particular theatre and screening where I saw this was well attended. I think this movie has some legs, and it will be interesting to see hw it will do in the US market as well. Meanwhile, if you like historical dramas or are simply in the mood for a quality foreign movie, ""A Royal Affair"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1351814400,395,1915,4.835365853658536

5464996,5,B00APOQR4E,"I saw this in the theater when my husband (who is a film scholar) was out-of-town and I was so impressed by it that I bought a copy, to try to convince him to watch it.  For some reason, that endeavor was like pulling teeth, but when we finally watched it together a few nights ago, my husband had to admit that it fully lived up to everything I had said about it.

The film is based on a staggering series of events that had an explosive impact on Denmark, just as Europe was being transformed by the Enlightenment.  The acting is truly exceptional... not only, as one would expect, from Mads Mikkelsen, but also by the two actors who play the king and queen... we were particularly amazed to learn in the extras that the actor who so masterfully plays the king is new to film acting!  The writing and direction are superb.

When interviewed at the Berlin Film Festival, Mads Mikkelsen said it was his favorite of the films he has starred in... HIGHLY recommended!",1508630400,4,965,4.429378531073446

But he was also very,very good..but this is what make's people like this star's and I think it was only the first or second film for the guy who played the king..also I liked Mads Mikkelson..did he steal the show though? No I wouldn't say so.but still was a great movie! Very well done! It was worth the wait!

5464999,5,B00APOQR4E,"This film is an absolute must see! It is an absolute master piece of 18th Century Danish history. This is another great example of what is written in a text books about a nation's history is often diluted and often wrong. Overview Danish history glosses over much of this story, but this film brings quite a bit of detail to light. This is the true story of a German doctor brought on by the counsel of the King of Denmark, Christian VII, who suffers from some form of mental illness that effects his judgement, his marriage, and his public behavior quite pervasively. The Doctor is able to improve to some degree the 'mad' kings behaviors and in time guides Danish policy in concert with the Queen, who, from the title, is involved with him. The three bring reforms to Denmark ahead of other European nations and America in the Age of Enlightenment. This film was done on a fairly low budget, but it looks grand. It takes place in several of the castles in Denmark that add to the grandeur, but some of the scenes show an attention to detail that will impress. Lastly, it is appropriate for Americans to see this film in light of the 2016 election. It is also a story of how the 'establishment' will go crazy when they lose power to an outsider.",1507420800,3,1246,4.469298245614035

5465006,4,B00APOQR4E,"1770's and 80's Denmark -- well acted with a lot to ponder. Certainly everyone was struggling to come out of the middle ages. The wealthy needed to start sharing and caring and this may be more important than the rejection of religion which is central in this movie.

Questions that are left latent: Was the Council less democratic and more evil than rule by a crazy self-indulgent king?  Is the religion they are demonizing Catholic or Protestant? What advances had the Protestant reformation already put into play?  I suppose it didn't matter to the rebels of the age of enlightenment, but I think it would have added some subtlety and depth to paint some of this ambiguity into the picture.

This movie is ideological about the secular age: no sharing of blame, nothing but light and goodness on one side, evil on the faith side.  Reading Roseau's biography about his treatment of his babies and his wife should make it hard to whitewash the age.  Nevertheless, the enlightenment brought light to the cruelty of the age, even though it could not stand true to its intent anymore than the age of faith could.  Well worth watching.",1495929600,,1132,4.744897959183674

However he went too fast, too much and ultimately led to his downfall although he did try to introduce vaccination and health care (shades of Obamacare !)

I couldn't help but think of how vile the Republicans and Democrats are in USA, taking all of US for granted, as I watched.

5465110,5,B00APOQR4E,"I really liked this movie.  It's a true story about an English duchess who is sent to Sweden to marry the young king, Frederik 1st.  He is a rather odd man who clearly has deep emotional problems  and possibly a little mad.  They do consummate the marriage and live as husband and wife for a short time.  She becomes pregnant and has a son who is the heir -apparent.  The king and she have a strained relationship following the birth of the son and she can barely stand the king's ridiculous rantings and behavior.  The country is being run by a council of men who treat the citizens terribly
and keep them downtrodden and terribly poor.  No money is spent on roads, health matters or anything else that would improve the country.  Then a doctor is confronted by two men who have been pushed out of the palace by the council.  They feel that if he can become the king's doctor, he can vouch for letting them back into the court.  He is a liberal who hates the domination by the council.  He and the king become close friends and he gets the king to do away with the council.  So they make many good changes to the country.  In the meantime, the doctor and the queen start an affair.  It is well hidden from the king since he and the queen no longer share a bed.  The story continues with several twists and turns and eventually the queen is kicked out of the palace.  I know none of the actors but the acting was very good.  The scenery was beautiful.  Will watch it again.",1475020800,3,1473,4.290909090909091

5465143,5,B00APOQR4E,"A true epic that reads like a made-up story. The 18th century costumes, the scenery, add to the film's verisimilitude. The true protagonist of the story is the king's physician Mads Mikkelsen) who, despite humble beginnings, replaces the king and royal council in controlling the affairs of the state and directing it toward accepting Enlightenment views in the framing of its laws. This enormous power spills over to his control of the king's marriage bed. Unlike some viewers, I found Mikkelsen ideal for this role. His Jack Palance-like looks add a special charm to his character. Alicia Vikander as the Queen and the actor portraying the somewhat deranged king provide wonderfully persuasive performances. A clear 5-star film for me.",1474243200,,737,5.201680672268908

Parents need to be warned the sex scenes between Caroline and her doctor boyfriend are explicit and inappropriate. But the movie was otherwise pretty good and explored a very interesting episode in 18th century history. One of the few Danish episodes that has managed to get famous outside of Scandinavia. The doctor is a little romanticized -- I personally feel he was more of a cold, ambitious character in real life-- but sentimentalizing is normal in a chick flick.

5465252,5,B00APOQR4E,"I rented this movie for one reason only.... Alicia Vikander. I had already seen her in ""Pure"" (her first feature film), which I rated 5 stars, and Ex Machina which I rated 4 stars. She is an amazing young actor who has a bright future, especially after having won an Academy Award for her role in ""The Danish Girl"". As for ""A Royal Affair"" (which is based on historical facts) I ended up being more fascinated by the story than by Alicia's acting. Now, don't get me wrong, she plays her character very well, but she gets over-shadowed by the 2 male leads ( Mads Mikkelsen and Mikkel Flsgaard) who were magnificent. Other reviewers do an excellent job of describing the movie (at least the 5 star reviews do), so I'll not duplicate them, and will end by saying that I was so intrigued by the movie's story that it prompted me into reading all that I could find online concerning Denmark and the European ""Enlightenment"" in the latter 18th century. Such was the power of this movie for me. But, you don't need to watch it for historical purposes. It stands on its own with its screenplay, acting, sets, costumes, and music score.",1473292800,,1127,4.529411764705882

It does use subtitles, but they are only a minor inconvenience and the narrative is well worth putting up with them.

I am a believer that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" and this truth is well-acted in believable surroundings. An excellent production with a forgivable flaw in continuity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie begins with the exiled queen speaking to her deceased lover's horse about him. Nowhere did I observe that the doctor had a favored horse or favored horses in general; this did not come through to me. Neither does this:  how she came to acquire this horse and get it into Germany. This is a small thing and I am hereby on alert to be more careful when I view it again. Maybe I've missed something.

Yet, I find I have the same aversion to the casting as I did four years ago and that is why I take 2 stars off -- for the casting of Mads Mikkelsen.  This part could have had so much pizzazz, justifying the romantic swing of the movie.  Mads is too dour, too stiff, too deadpan non-attractive.  when he does smile (a rarity in any movie he's been in) it is almost embarrassing, it seems so forced. I don't understand the appeal for this actor, though it goes to show how he landed Hannibal.

5465347,5,B00APOQR4E,Wow incredibly good film. I was hooked from beginning to end. I loved how realistic and human the characters were. Nobody was completely good nor completely bad. Definitely thought about some common themes that run through anybody's life such as trust and freedom to think for oneself. Just reminds us how far we've come as a society and how grateful we should be for the brave people who have given us this freedom.,1472860800,,416,4.712328767123288

The settings are generally lush, the good and evil, the mediocre fairly well defined. The actors are obviously committed to bringing realism to their roles and so the film entertains and enlightens at the same time.",1472774400,,398,4.782608695652174

5465370,5,B00APOQR4E,"Alicia Vikander, the only famous member of the cast, gives a heartbreaking portrayal of the 18th-century English princess who was married by proxy to the mad King Christian of Denmark before she ever met him. She managed to bear him a son before his insulting, erratic behavior alienated her to the point that she could barely stand to be in his presence, at which time they began to live totally separate lives, except on those occasions when affairs of state dictated that they appear together in public. Slowly she falls in love with the king's doctor who, influenced by  Enlightenment ideas, attempts to help the peasantry of Denmark. When jealousy and the loss of their prerogatives inspire the aristocrats of Denmark to destroy them both, the doctor and his lover suffer horribly for their love and idealism. The ending of the movie is uplifting, however, as the queen's account of their lives written while in exile in Germany inspire her son Frederick to be a better, more humane ruler than his father.
Wonderful acting, period music, beautiful costumes, and excellent cinematography add to the beauty of the movie.",1472774400,,1123,4.973404255319149

It is the tragic and true story of the young Queen Caroline Matilde of Denmark, her erratic and mentally unstable husband King Christian, and the German royal physician Johann Frederich Struensee. Power struggles within the court, a medieval power structure in Denmark that suppresses it's people, and two people who are enchanted by the spirit of the Enlightenment, and then, each other. The acting of Alicia Vikander and Mads Mikkelsen as the doomed lovers is heart-breaking. The costumes and sets are lucious. This story is part of Denmark's history, the cultural and political collision and two people caught in the crush of history.

5465427,5,B00APOQR4E,"Struennse suffered died for committing adultery, his negligences to the people confounded with his love for Caroline.  The Court that Frederik abolished, lied, and met their fate.  The King, who practiced sin, was well still the King.  How the court ever was ever to get back in power, was written in the script.  The story is of documentary style, but still a fictional drama.  The greatest suspense was when the Queen got pregnant with the doctor's child.  Interesting, how Struennse, the Kings trust and friend, manipulated the King, and cared less for him after he fell in love with Caroline.  Demonstrative for today's day and age, otherwise, this compulsion to review the film would not be here.  Perhaps anyone else may see the seriousness of adultery and lying.  The doctor's original activist for human rights was undamaged, and reinstituted by Frederik.  The story shows how people in power can  mislead by their personal interests and women..  Whether that be power, money and love.  Especially if those women who have power, are sinister, and are greedy.  And  by a beautiful and sexy Queen. Queen Caroline lost both children, and died sick and alone from her tempestuous and sordid affair.  To say the King of Prussia lost his head for her is an understatement.",1472601600,,1274,4.938679245283019

The 17 year old sister of  Englands  King George III  who became the tragic Queen of  Denmark was beautifully portrayed.  Historical record indicates the Queen died in exile in Germany at age 24.  Movie is well worth viewing in my opinion. I give it 4 and a half stars.  The dialoque for non Danish speakers is not really a problem.  The subtitles work well.

5465453,4,B00APOQR4E,"An excellent piece of historical fiction. Based on actual events the movie describes a scenario that has occurred more than once when enlightened thinkers face the powers that be. The love story is almost incidental, however necessary, but it completes the characterizations at the end. It's not clear whether the love story is historically accurate (i'm sure you can check it out) but it is integral to and succeeds in completing the story.

Anything that engaging is obviously a testament to the excellent acting, direction & editing. Had the film been too slow, the music inappropriate, or the story not reflected so well by movement, expression, and voiceless storytelling, the brain would have been taken away from the memorizing  story and been reminded that  I was reading subtitles rather than being told a fascinating story.  I guess I was suddenly fluent in Danish! The nice thing about history is that it reminds us that lives never simply disappear, there is always a trace influencing  the future. I always wish the dead could see the ultimate value of their lives.  It was lucky that the real story was written and passed along so it could make such a direct impact.  It was interesting to see that Denmark, always viewed as very progressive, had the same bleak systems in the beginning. Even though the US had a birth from revolution it still had the same sort of system relying on slavery, indentured servitude, and ""marriage"" until each of those systems were changed by different forms of rebellion,  even the personal quiet ones.  When I hear (read) people complain about subtitles, I do think there are some very bad subtitled movies, but it's because it just wasn't a good movie and the subtitling really underscored how bad it was.",1471305600,,1432,4.860082304526749

5465595,5,B00APOQR4E,"I've seen this film three years ago and now I saw this last night again. The difference was I now know Alicia Vikander more since I saw her other movies, I mean even her most difficult to find movies like <Pure><Hotell>.
Even though I like Alicia so much, it was not surprising that Mads Mikkelsen was such a great actor that he rulled the film and I felt like Alicia was not the main actor to me. She was merely the supporting roll.
As we all know Mads Mikkelsen was starred in great movies like <THE HUNT>.
It will be a shame to talk about the story I will be brief. The mentally ill and childish king marries Alicia, a beautiful queen and she was at first suffering from his strange behavior, but she begins to understand him.
When the king found out the doctor Mads Mikkenisen who knows how to deal with any kind of people in his own way, they become friends and finally he ends up with even make him the most powerful man who rulls the kingdom.
Mads Mikkenisen on the other hand madly falls in love with the queen Alicia. They make love every night. They even have a baby.
Finding out that, the mother of the king tries to re-summons the former statesman. She succedes and they all gatheres and kills Mads.
The queen end up with living outside the palace in her girlfriend's house.
The cinematography was more then just beautiful. It was top class art film.
The music is all classic beauty.
Alicia did her best but because of her roll, she was kind of one dimentional charactor. But because she was naturally so beautiful, I honestly didn't care. I was just happy to see her whenever she appears in screen.
Seeing Mads Mikkenisen is just blessing. He can do any roll, I mean any roll at all. He is the actor of the century. Sometimes so warm hearted man, sometimes so evil.
Also the king's roll was good too. The director cast the actors very well.
The running time was about 130 minutes but I never felt boring even a single minute. And I also never thought that this was my second time watching this film.
If you want a movie that actors are so well acted, this is the one you should see.",1458086400,,2095,4.333333333333333

5465643,5,B00APOQR4E,"Don't blow off this film just because of the lame title, turgid start and the fact that it's a costume drama.

Once it gets going there is just as much betrayal and intrigue as any season of Game of Thrones (only this is a true story, not a pastiche rip off of every myth in history). The acting is uniformly excellent, the love interest (AV) is REALLY good, better than the blonde dope with the chipmunk cheeks and the dragons who likes to take her clothes off.

MM is fantastic, and the guy who plays the King is great in a crucial role. The film wouldn't work without him being excellent.

Also admirable are the production design and overall palette of the film. A lot of grays and creams, not many bright colors. The music by Gabriel Yared and another guy is also very good. All in all  a lot of production value for what must have been a modest budget.

Particularly good is the way the director contrasts the life of the nobility with the lives of the peasants. He doesn't beat you over the head with it, which is refreshing. It will help to have a least a passing knowledge of the contemporaneous French Revolution (which is the elephant in the room, of course). If you know who Voltaire, Robespierre etc are, and what happened to much of the nobility, you will be in good shape.

If you enjoy mad kings you might also enjoy ""Ludwig"" by Luchino Visconti. With out-of-this-world casting of Romy Schneider and Helmet Berger (disclaimer: running time is nearly 4 hours and it's hard to find) but worth it.

Mads Mikklesen (villain in Casino Royale) is marvelous as the Royal Doctor, Alicia Vikander as the beautiful young queen married to a crazed king. The illicit love affair between queen and doctor is found out with tragic consequences. For me this is hard to watch but I've always been a sucker for such romances, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, et al. There are behind the scenes politicking by queen and doctor as they try to change Denmark's archaic and outdated laws, so you feel yourself routing for them in that way too.

After being married to the slightly off-kilter King of Denmark, the Queen finds solace in her relationship (and subsequent romance) with the royal physician. Their enlightened ideals create swift policy change and bring about a revolution in Danish political history until their affair is discovered and severe consequences result.

What did I think?

Not quite the bodice-ripping, passionate tale that its title might suggest, the film does manage to effectively convey the historical implications of the events in the film. It adheres a bit too strictly to period-piece conventions and doesnt do much to invest reason to care about the relationship between the lovers. Historical accuracy is given priority over the romantic swoon factor, which makes everything feel somewhat dry. Only Mikkel Folsgaard as the mad King injects a bit of humor and liveliness into the proceedings.",1431648000,,897,5.392857142857143

5465700,5,B00APOQR4E,"For many people outside of Europe, it was  the Unit One police series from Denmark that introduced  Mads Mikkelson.  Whereas in that popular series he played the joking womaniser who occasionally did some police work next to his offbeat sidekick, Mikkelsen has to carry this role without an obvious male on screen comparison (although Folsgarrd as the mad King Christian V11 gives him a good run).  This role requires a more thoughtful, more nuanced response as Dr Struensee,  the royal doctor and Queens lover , and,  propagator of policies of the emerging Danish Enlightenment. Producer, Nikolaj Arcel does not let Mikkelsen dominate the screen, working with a top supporting cast such as the gorgeous Alicia Vikander  (someone to watch in the future ) and Mikkel Boe Folsgarrd as Queen Caroline and mad King Christian V11.  The costumes are magnificent and the locations around Copenhagen are vivid and eye-catching.

However, this movie has been the best of this kind that I have seen.  It isn't incredibly depressing and it actually makes you appreciate the three characters and like them.  In most movies like this I find them depressing and almost painful to watch.  I was shocked that I actually liked all characters who were involved in affairs and arranged marriages.  It was because they were all presented in a way that made you understand them, like them, and enjoy the story.

It was very interesting to see some Danish history and hear about some of the great strides that were taken during this reign.  It was uplifting and the dialog and acting were great.  The romantic relationship was actually believable and I really felt for the characters.  In a lot of movies like this the relationships are not believable but they did a good job here.  I definitely ship the queen and Struensee heh.

The only thing I did not like was the ending.  It ended on such a sad state.  I felt so depressed and I cried a bit at the end.  On the other hand, the letter to her children and the text about what happened afterwards at the end was a bit uplifting.  But I would have preferred to see her son actually overthrow the government and reinstate Struensee's laws.  I feel they could have easily made a totally awesome part two to this movie showing this.

As a result, I am taking 1 star off due to the depressing ending.  I did not like the movie ending on a note where ""evil triumphs"" so to speak.  The text at the end was just not enough to promote this to a real 5 star movie.  I know that this is about history and history should not be rewritten, but I still feel that the way that they presented the end diminished what could have been a feeling of ""this movie is awesome!!""  it which would have warranted 5 stars.  To see her son kick those jerks out of the court would have done that.

Overall though, this movie was quite good for its genre.  On a side note, I really wanted to read the full letter that the queen sent to her children.  I will probably google and see if I can find any real letters she sent them.",1422316800,,2321,4.275862068965517
5465737,5,B00APOQR4E,"""En Kongelig affaere"" is an R-rated Danish/Swedish production (it opened in March, 2012 in Denmark) based on a novel by Bodil Steensen-Leth. The story is about King Christian VII, an insane king of Denmark, whose young wife falls in love with the royal physician. Pretty tawdry stuff, huh?

That's what the over-simplified publicity says. I say that this multi-layered historical drama is absolutely wonderful from beginning to end and it makes us want to re-examine what the history books have said. Every character is fully developed, the costumes and locations are carefully reproduced and the story is based on real people, for better or for worse.

It stars:
  * Alicia Vikander (""Anna Karenina"") as the young queen Caroline Mathilde, a member of the British royal family, wed to a Danish king and forever exiled from her homeland. Her situation is little better than slavery, her duty is to bear a heir, nothing more. Her beloved books are sent back to England because the censors don't approve. The camera LOVES this young woman's face!
  * Mads Mikkelsen (""After the Wedding"") as the German-born physician Johann Friedrich Struensee, a reform-minded Free Thinker, who is opposed to serfdom (which is another word for slavery), eager to tax the rich to pay for orphanages, rid the streets of sewage, and vaccinate the general population against smallpox (radical ideas, indeed). This fine actor had us on the edge of our seats!
  * Mikkel Boe Flsgaard (Lots of Danish TV) is wonderful as King Christian VII, selfish, immature, spontaneous, easily misled and cruelly managed by his self-serving council. As he starts to authorize the reforms suggested by his physician, the privy council fights back. This actor makes us wonder how crazy the king really was...

This mixture of Danish, Swedish, French and German (yes, captions) has a voiceover reading a letter from the banished Queen to her children, one of whom, history tells us, is the future King Frederich VI, who transformed Denmark into a modern country.

Seattle is a movie-going town, but even I was surprised by the standing-room only crowd in one of the last local theaters where it is playing. I guess the folks who missed it will have to see it on DVD. Of course it being nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2013 Oscars hasn't hurt, either.

5465740,3,B00APOQR4E,"A ROYAL AFFAIR has distinct intertextual links to Nicholas Hytner's THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE in its portrayal of a mad king (Mikkel Boe Flsgaard) who prefers his dogs and mistresses to marriage to a 17-year-old British heiress Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander).  Both of them develop a close relationship with German physician Johann Friedrich Streuensee (Mads Mikkelsen): the king regards him as his closest adviser, while the young queen falls in love with him.  Eventually that ""royal affair"" proves the undoing of both Caroline and Streuensee.

Told in flashback by the now-banished Caroline, A ROYAL AFFAIR creates an unsympathetic pictue of Danish court life in the mid-eighteenth century, one where the King is ruled by his cabinet, and where intrigue is rife.  No one can ever be sure of their jibs, especially when the King is so eccentric; but while they are in power, they exploit his weaknesses for all they are worth.  The Danish court are explicitly racist in their attitudes; not only do they mistrust Streuensee for his closeness to both monarchs, but they resent his presence on account of his Germanness.  The only way to force him out is to insist that he does not ""think like"" a Dane, and therefore cannot be allowed to influence government policy.  While the King stoutly supports Streuensee, he lacks both the guile and the self-possession to protect him.

Shot on location in the Czech Republic as well as in Denmark, Nikolaj Arcel's film creates a claustrophobic world in which every gesture can be interpreted as political.  The environment is as formal as the costumes; no one can ever have sufficient temerity to speak for themselves.  The exterior shots are familiar from most Anglo-American costume dramas (carriages pulling away from stately buildings, elaborately costumed balls etc.) but here they are invested with added meaning, as many of the landscapes outside the court appear both bare and poverty-stricken.  Clearly the King and his courtiers are too preoccupied with their own intrigues to worry about the people.

The pace is slow-moving, but this gives us a lot of time to focus on the protagonists' expressions - specifically the public faces that they show to the world that mask rather than disclose their true feelings.  A ROYAL AFFAIR is a savage denunciation of hypocrisy - although it might focus on the past, its politica significance remains significant today.",1421539200,2,2415,5.098984771573604

The performances of Mikkel Boe Fasgaard as King Christian the VII, Mads Mikkelson as Dr. Struensee and Alicia Vikander as Queen Caroline are all outstanding. Briefly the King is a nutball, his new wife and Queen falls for the King's best friend and advisor the German Doctor and Court intrigues begin. This movie is in Danish with English Subtitles only.

How could I watch a foreign movie, that I won't be able to understand?  I was wrong!  The remarkable acting, their beautiful danish accents, and the costumes just sweep you to their point in time.  This movie blew my mind away.  Such a great story based on real life events.  It was easy to follow the storyline with the subtitles, they weren't distracting except for a few times when the actors spoke too fast.  This is a wonderful story about mental disease, love triangle, death and hope.  The movie starts out with Princess Caroline Mathilde meeting her future husband for the first time.  I was eager to see him, but something was off about him; come to find out he wasn't exactly sound.  However because of his mental illness, Caroline is able to meet the love of her life. Dr Struensee gives her hope; for change; a new Denmark. The ending was expected;  unfortunate.  I wished that the King would have been able to do more to save Dr Struensee's life.

Suggestions to the audience rather than explicit content is better story telling, and, in my opinion shows greater confidence in an audience.  This is an incredible story: emotional, complicated, and profound. Based on what I've read, there was a real effort to be historically authentic and sympathetic, as well.

Why does the King of Sweden have a Nahtzee father in law?

Why did Marie Antoinette cheat with a Viking courtier?

Struensee was like the German version(ancestor) of Genyosha i.e. pick any opposition movement to the party in power - if it's monarchy, overturn the dynasty by setting up teahouses all over China and pour liberally as malcontents suss out a takeover, if it's KMT, train CCP; if it's CCP, offer training to democracy movements and ethnic minorities in exile in of all places - Mittel Europe.

But when the Weeping Angels using vicious locals get what they want, they'll change their tune:

Who killed Aung San Suu Kyi's father?

Whilst Aung San was in Japan, the Blue Print for a Free Burma, which has been widely but mistakenly attributed to him, was drafted.[6] In February 1941, Aung San returned to Burma, with an offer of arms and financial support from the Fumimaro Konoe government of Japan. He returned briefly to Japan to receive more military training, along with the first batch of young revolutionaries who came to be known as the Thirty Comrades.[2] On 26 December 1941, with the help of the Minami Kikan, a secret intelligence unit that was formed to close the Burma Road and to support a national uprising and that was headed by Colonel Suzuki, he founded the Burma Independence Army (BIA) in Bangkok, Thailand.[2] It was aligned with Japan for most of World War II.[2]

The former capital of Burma, Rangoon (now Yangon), fell to the Japanese in March 1942 (as part of the Burma Campaign in World War II). The BIA formed an administration for the country under Thakin Tun Oke that operated in parallel with the Japanese military administration until the Japanese disbanded it. In July, the disbanded BIA was re-formed as the Burma Defense Army (BDA). Aung San was made a colonel and put in charge of the force.[3] He was later invited to Japan, and was presented with the Order of the Rising Sun by Japanese Emperor Hirohito.[3]
Aung San in Burma National Army uniform.

On 1 August 1943, the Japanese declared Burma to be an independent nation. Aung San was appointed War Minister, and the army was again renamed, this time as the Burma National Army (BNA).[3] Aung San became skeptical of Japanese promises of true independence and of Japan's ability to win the war. As William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim put it ""It was not long before Aung San found that what he meant by independence had little relation to what the Japanese were prepared to give - that he had exchanged an old master for an infinitely more tyrannical new one. As one of his leading followers once said to me, 'If the British sucked our blood, the Japanese ground our bones!' He became more and more disillusioned with the Japanese, and early in 1943 we got news from Seagrim, a most gallant officer who had remained in the Karen Hills at the ultimate cost of his life, that Aung San's feelings were changing. On the 1st August 1944 he was bold enough to speak publicly with contempt of the Japanese brand of independence, and it was clear that, if they did not soon liquidate him, he might prove useful to us...At our first interview, Aung San began to take rather a high hand...I pointed out that he was in no position to take the line he had. I did not need his forces; I was destroying the Japanese quite nicely without their help, and could continue to do so. I would accept his help and that of his army only on the clear understanding that it implied no recognition of any provisional government...The British Government had announced its intention to grant self-government to Burma within the British Commonwealth, and we had better limit our discussion to the best method of throwing the Japanese out of the country...""[7] He made plans to organize an uprising in Burma and made contact with the British authorities in India, in cooperation with Communist leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe. On 27 March 1945, he led the BNA in a revolt against the Japanese occupiers and helped the Allies defeat the Japanese.[2] 27 March came to be commemorated as 'Resistance Day' until the military regime later renamed it 'Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) Day'.

__________

So there was suspense: would the liberals defeat the Tea Party of the time? What side would mad King Christian VII of Denmark support (quite unpredictable as you can imagine). Best of all for the love story was having the two outsiders, Mathilde and Struensee, cling together for intellectual, political, moral, and selfless reasons, not just because they were both ""hot.""

It wasn't Christianity that caused serfdom, for instance, or made some masters cruel, or demanded censorship.

5465878,5,B00APOQR4E,"As others have said, this film is based on a true story which is also an important story, especially for Denmark but also for the vastly more liberal Europe that was in the process of being born. The story begins with the arranged marriage between King Christian VII of Denmark and Princess Caroline Matilda of England.  By the time the princess was born her brother was already King George III of England, the same king who presided over our own revolution as well as the uneasy union of Ireland with England, making him the first true monarch of the UK.  One valuable thing the movie does is to flesh out the very appealing character of Matilda, who was both informal in her manners and a great reader, always curious about, and sympathetic with, the ideas of equality and liberty which were gaining traction in her lifetime.  Evidently the realization that their young queen was always considered charming and bright is new even to Danes, who learn the rudiments of this story as schoolchildren much as we learn about our revolutionary figures when we are that age, which is to say, as little more than stick figures.  Naturally enough the Danish focus has always been on the king whom Matilda married and their son, who became a very great, justly famous king.  At the age of fifteen, Caroline Matilda voyaged to Denmark where she found that she was unlucky in her marriage.  Whether Christian was mad or merely erratic, whether he was homosexual or merely inclined to confuse his wife with his daunting mother, he was always viewed as a foolish child by the nobility who controlled him and, through him, the country.  Their wish was to insulate Denmark from the modern ideas beginning to permeate Europe while preserving and maximizing their own wealth and power.  Social change began when a brilliant German doctor, Struensee, became Christian's first friend and, gradually, his sole political advisor. Eventually, however, for whatever reason (possibly bi-polar illness), Christian sank into a catatonic depression that left Struensee in power as de facto king -- and a very energetic king, too, issuing some 1,069 cabinet orders in about ten months.  During this time the two free-thinking foreigners, a low-born German doctor and the English Queen, almost certainly found both joy and solace in the queen's bed, forming as a small and very happy family into which the queen bore a daughter who was almost certainly fathered by Struensee.  These events comprise most of the movie which is a joy to watch, beautiful, fascinating, and very erotic.  Perhaps because the acting is so very good, the film never becomes either a preachy history lesson or a stilted costume drama.  Of course the preternaturally gifted Mikkelsen is a joy to watch, but so are the young Swedish actress who plays the queen and the novice actor who gives a masterful performance as the unfortunate king.  Still, even as we enjoy watching the two sensual and charming lovers, we realize that they are behaving very unwisely, failing at every step to protect themselves from the malice of the nobles and the superstitious rage of the people over whom the nobles have great influence.  Struensee's worst failure may have been scorning to form any coalition of power with the few nobles who might have been able to protect him from the many nobles who believed that both he and the queen were flouting all Danish custom while demeaning the beloved monarchy.  Therefore, for the two lovers, the ending had to be sad, and because the movie has so much emotional power from the first scene, of course their downfall is sad to watch, although it is also brief.  Moreover, as we learn in a final summary, in some sense the revolutionary doctor and his queen will triumph in the end, because the Denmark which they wanted so very much to create was soon recreated by Caroline Matilda's son, Frederick, who outdid Struensee himself in bringing about a famously bloodless, and even more liberal, revolution.  And that revolution has, of course, endured.  This is a movie I can unequivocally recommend as emotionally and aesthetically irresistible.",1396742400,,4117,4.916305916305916

Its Denmark at the time of the Enlightenment.  The young King Christian is borderline insane --although, in the most complex performance with the most complex character in the film, Mikkel Folsgaard shows us many sides to this tormented soul.  But the film focuses on the more straightforward young Queen shipped in from England, miserable in her loveless marriage to this sad clown of a king, and a very well intentioned German doctor and free-thinker, who feeds the Queen's intellect, and ultimately her body, while calming and befriending the young King, and working with him to bring in new laws that took Denmark out of the dark ages.  All this doesnt go over very well with the sitting court, who are loathe to give any power or economic freedom to the people, and so scheme to fight back.

Other than the King, the characters tend to black and white portrayals, but the actual steps of this true (if somewhat romanticized) slice of history make for a quite engrossing film.",1395964800,2,1131,4.99468085106383

5465890,5,B00APOQR4E,"This is a beautiful movie that is masterfully directed and wonderfully and convincingly acted.  The view feels a genuine sympathy for the English Queen Caroline who is whisked off to Denmark to marry King Christian who is, at the very least, extremely eccentric and might even be mentally disturbed.  At the beginning of the movie the viewer develops a strong dislike for King Christian, but once you see how he is treated and patronized by his council, you begin to develop more than a little sympathy for him as well.  Caroline, being so very young herself, fails to understand the young king and his debauched and weird ways and the two become estranged.

Alicia Vikander plays the part of Queen Caroline extremely well.  Her starstruck princess act gives way to her disgust for her new husband while still playing the part of a dedicated mother.  Vikander resists the temptation to overact many of these scenes and gives them a grace and nuance all their own.  Mikkel Flsgaard is especially good as the mercurial,eccentric, and highly changeable King Christian IV.  His fickle moods are convincing and quite well done.  His character is also well developed in the story.

Later, the king is given a court companion, a German physician Dr. Johan Freidrich Struensee, who is also an intellectual child of the Enlightenment.  His friendship with Christian changes him for the better, and with the help of Struensee, and Queen Caroline, with whom Struensee has an unfortunately love affair, Christian brings modern reforms to Denmark.  The star-struck lovers and reformers are doomed, however, by the nobility whom they have royally ticked off.  Their affair is discovered,and Caroline is exiled and Struensee is executed.

Danish film icon Mads Mikkelsen does a remarkable job playing Struensee.  He embodies the intellectual passion of the 18th century reformer and the carnal passion for the Queen that eventually dooms him.  Mikkelsen gives an outstanding performance that, in many ways, makes the story.

I must also give kudos to director Nikolaj Arcel who expertly constructed each scene with enough attention to detail to make this a period piece that really drew the audience into the times and the narrative of the story without cluttering it to the point of confusion and weariness.

Perhaps the script was a little more modern than may have been authentic, but this is a small price to pay for such a great film.  Highly recommended.",1394236800,,398,5.1875

5465898,1,B00APOQR4E,"The true story on which this film is based, is full of drama and conflict. This film, unfortunately, barely touches the surface. It is a monotone Danish history lesson which is far too long.",1393200000,6,190,4.617647058823529
5465899,4,B00APOQR4E,"This film was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2012.  It my opinion, american audiences have greatly missed on such wonderful costume drama and it is unfortunate that film did not receive as much publicity in the US as it should.

It is a historical drama set in Denmark at the time when Voltaire was making his mark in France.  Europe was comprized of countries that lived in feudal social strata.  There were kings and queens and nobility and then there were indentured servants.  At the same time the age of enlightment was becoming to make its mark and many proponents of this philosophy were considered to be enemies of the state.

Caroline was a young British princess promised to marriage to Denmark's king since she was a child.  He upbringing was marked be her education about Denmark, danish language, fine arts and subordination to her future husband and king.  She is thoughful and sensitive creature and she willingly accepts her fate as she sees it as a part of her royal duty.  Danish king on the other hand is immature and weak.  He is not happy about his destiny of being a ruler since he prefers havign fun, going to the parties and chasing other women.  Their marriage is an arrangement, until one day new doctor comes to the court whose only task is to manage increasingly unpredictable young ruler.  This moment changes destiny of all three people involved, as well as history of Denmark.

At the time, film drags on, but it is interesting to watch court intrigues, rush for power and prestige, fabulous costumes....  Game between autocracy and democracy is blurred and everyone is interested in keeping their power, money and influence off and on the court.  Before long these three young people are entangled in the private affairs and affairs of the state and for such young and inexperienced people without strong political backup it is a game of self destruction when it is only a matter of time when their house of cards will fall right under them.

For anyone who likes good historical drama, this is a perfect film.  It is in Danish language, so if you are not into reading subtitles, this movie is not for you.  All actors are wonderful.",1393113600,,2179,4.689473684210526

My heart was shattered by the time it was over and somehow I was affected by this movie for a couple of weeks lol. Just really fell in love with the two main actors. But alas.. tragedy wins again. Definitely one of the best period pieces I've ever seen. I definitely recommend.",1393113600,,440,4.25

5465902,3,B00APOQR4E,"The movie seemed too last forever. This period piece reflected the division between the aristocracy and the common folk, the ""haves vs the have nots"" and the beginning of social change in Denmark. It was an ok movie, just slow.",1392768000,,227,4.7

The acting, the story, I loved everything about it! I would give it 100 starts if I could!",1392422400,,266,4.34
5465904,4,B00APOQR4E,"This was a history lesson, and although I have no idea how accurate it was, it has been my experience that a lack of action and over-the-top scenes probably means the movie has stuck fairly close to what was documented in the history books. The portrayal of the politics involved in these royals' lives was very interesting. You could ""feel"" how the King and Queen were at the mercy of those around them. Even when they tried to break free and make their own decisions it only lasted a few moments and came with reprisals. The costuming and locations were believable and made me feel as if I was watching the actual events of the late 1700s. Other than the subtitles, which one gets used to, this was a completely enjoyable movie for me.",1392163200,,737,4.507462686567164

It's almost cartoonish with the extreme personalities of especially the men.  Of course there is a lot of sexual immorality.  I suppose the story does give some insight into what the arranged royal marriages were like.",1391385600,,406,4.534246575342466

5465912,5,B00APOQR4E,"While obviously for fairly mature tastes, A ROYAL AFFAIR is a film that has it all.

--An engaging and compelling plot: Even if a film about the 18th-century Danish monarchy doesn't sound so thrilling, it is. Much suspense of the slower, intelligent kind. Complex but clear layers. Romance and some sex.

--Fine acting by all of the major and minor players. Mikkel Boe Flsgaard as mad King Christian VII convincingly--and amusingly--steals the show. Alicia Vikander and Mads Mikkelsen also give very memorable performances. Great costume design as well.

--A lucid illustration of the purpose and effects of the Enlightenment, showing it rather than telling it and never becoming heavy-handed or preachy.

--Nice blend of moods: poignant and melancholy in places, laugh-out-loud funny in others, but always straightforward and realistic.

I could go on and on here, but suffice it to say that A ROYAL AFFAIR is a wonderfully rich experience and one of the best all-around films I have seen in quite a while.",1391126400,,1007,5.115853658536586

5465922,5,B00APOQR4E,"I am completely amazed by this movie. I felt like I was there with them in the. I believe this is almost EXACTLY how it actually happened in the 16th century. She was so young, if she only knew then what they did was going to shape history forever. The three of them had complete love for each other. I believe you love all people differently and this is proof. Christian was indeed mentally ill but he had a good heart. I think he fought within himself his whole life. I think everyday was a battle with his mind first then the rest of the world. And I really believe since Johan was truly a man above men, He saw Christian just the same as one of the common people suffering because they were different from the nobles. In return I believe that is also the reason Christian loved Johan. He was his first best friend, a brother he never knew he could have. I'm sure he felt acceptance and personal gain to his confidence. I think a combination of these things made Caroline love them both but also realized she loved Johan first. She knew he was a little off but he couldn't help it. Plus the way he was treated by the people who surrounded him was horrible. She was only 16?! She was a known free thinker. When she really got to know Johan for the great free thinker he was and his connections to them, it was finding what she had always imagined the love of her life would be. I think she handled herself quite well considering the times they lived in. Thank you again to this entire cast. I have already sought out other movies by Mads and Alicia. Loved this! I LOVED IT!!",1389484800,,1576,4.256666666666667

5465924,5,B00APOQR4E,"The acting was amazing and the dynamics between the German, the queen, and the king was intriguing. My favorite actor was the king. In the beginning it was easy to hate him, but as the movie progressed you begin to see his humanity through his child-like qualities. It wasn't the affair between the queen and the German that stole my heart, but it was the friendship between the German and the king. This is what made it difficult for me to accept the affair, because the king loved the queen like a mother and the German like a best friend.

The use of the council men, propaganda, government, the people, and the Enlightment made the message at the end difficult to ignore. Some of us are so easily led by the propaganda of the news and news papers not realizing that it is only half of the story. We make are decisions and assumptions based on a one sided story that neglects to tell the whole truth. How far propaganda can go is revealed and unsettling at the end of this movie.",1389225600,,982,4.395604395604396

I'm not going to tell you what the movie is about, you can read that in the other reviews or in IMBD (which rates this 7.5 out of 10).

A ROYAL AFFAIR is the true story of a doctor plucked out of treating Denmark's indigents to become the young king's royal physician. The Danish King Christian VII is ... well, he's peculiar and maybe a little insane.  He has an arranged marriage to one of England's princesses.  Imagine being a well-educated, progressive, 14 year old princess and getting sent off to marry someone who is rude, crude, and repulsive.  Makes you glad to be a commoner, eh?  The King and his wife both come to love this doctor (in different ways) and this doctor influences them to start a revolution to free us, the commoners.

Gripping story.  Watch the movie then research the history or research the history then watch the movie.  It is really a great movie.

Maybe I should have rated it 5 stars ...",1385683200,,1068,4.597883597883598

At first, I was hesistant to watch it because I was afraid it was going to be another sappy, melodramatic romance about adultery. However, I love history and period films enough to give it a shot. It snagged me from the minute I started watching. The pacing of the story, the characters, the acting, the cinematrography -- it was all very wonderful and intriguing. It had a surprisingly ominous and suspenseful feel. Even when things are good and happy, you just know it's not going to last for very long. I'm not going to recap the plot because other reviewers have already done so. All I will say is that A Royal Affair is definitely worth a try and is much more than what it may seem to be (I went in knowing nothing about it, so...) Also, I would recommend it for people who normally find history boring.

This is the first film I have ever seen featuring the Danish monarchy and one that takes you into their personal lives during a time called the age of Enlightenment that was sweeping Europe in the 1700s.  Enlightenment did not come easily to Denmark because the changes would significantly reduce certain powers of the aristocracy and the church if more freedoms and services were to be provided for the betterment of the people.  This film is a peek into the Danish perspective of the historic metamorphous to a more social society.  And, it provides a glimpse into royal protocol and the private lives of some key players as well as the strategy that launched monumental changes and the sacrifices that were made.  I found this film intriguing.",1383868800,,990,4.869047619047619

5465962,4,B00APOQR4E,"""A Royal Affair"" (En kongelig affre) is an account of the love affair between Queen Caroline Mathilde of Denmark and her husband's physician, the reformist Dr. Johann Struensee, in late-eighteenth century Denmark that led briefly to sweeping political reforms in that country. This account draws heavily on two novelizations of the relationship. In 1766, a teenaged Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander) arrives from England to marry King Christian VII of Denmark (Mikkel Flsgaard), not realizing that he is mentally ill, childlike, and prone to outbursts. The King's jealousy of his new wife causes him to mistreat her, and the Queen, in turn, openly resents her husband. In 1769, the King returns from a trip abroad with a new physician who is able to calm his mood swings. Dr. Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen) is a radical Enlightenment thinker, however, and finds the Queen like-minded.

Director Nikolaj Arcel has made a beautiful period film. The cast is beautiful too, conspicuously moreso than these people were in real life, though Mikkel Flsgaard does look a bit like Christian VII. Mads Mikkelsen is downright swarthy and much more masculine, by modern standards, than Dr. Struensee. The Danish film industry is learning from Hollywood. These are attractive people in attractive costumes, against a backdrop of gloomy Denmark, where the Enlightenment had not yet reached. The reformers must fight pestilence, abusive serfdom, a budget crisis, and powerful reactionary forces. The language spoken in the film is Danish, which would not have been the case in reality. German and French were spoken at court. Queen Caroline Mathilde didn't speak Danish, in fact. But the filmmakers understandably wanted to emphasize the story's Danish-ness.

The Queen and Dr. Struensee are painted as flawed but heroic and ahead of their time. I'm sure they were those things, but they went out of their way to flaunt their affair in a socially conservative culture, and they tried to do too much too fast with limited resources and without the support of key factions in the government. It's interesting that the film chooses to make the couple more discreet than they actually were and de-emphasizes their libertine convictions, though those were as much a part of their ideology as their views on social justice. ""A Royal Affair"" is an enjoyable film that brings pivotal events in Danish history to a broad audience. The camera loves Alicia Vikander, who is Swedish and has since taken a number of roles in Hollywood films. A lot of credit is due Mikkel Flsgaard as well, for making an annoying King who often does the wrong things sympathetic and comprehensible.

Mads Mikkelsen is one of my more favored actors. However, there is nothing holding the spine of this film firmly together and where Mads should have led with passion, his talent is looking stone-faced and immovable.

Ergo, there is really nothing driving this story in the sense of a spine or single point of view. Where Mads could have led with a personal stamp of emotion and raw drive of the character to succeed at his goal, he merely poses and styles himself as economically as possible, it seems.

In better portraits of the real Streunsee, one can see a knowing, penetrating blaze in the eye npt pertaining to Mads' characterization at all:

5465980,4,B00APOQR4E,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Who knew? The history of the Danish Royal family is just as fascinating as the British Monarchy. 'A Royal Affair' is a historical drama based on the 18th century machinations of the court of King Christian VII of Denmark.

The film begins when Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, travels to Denmark, to consummate her arranged marriage to King Christian VII. Keep in mind that Caroline was only 15 years old when she got hitched to Christian (Alicia Vikander, who plays Caroline, was about 24 when the film was made). To put it mildly, Caroline is shocked when she discovers that the King is not the prince of her dreams. In fact, he's both coarse and possibly mentally ill.

'A Royal Affair' is most fascinating when the focus is on King Christian. Was he really mentally ill? Some say he would have been diagnosed as schizophrenic today and certainly he had a number of 'meltdowns' that would suggest that he was seriously off his rocker. My theory is that he probably would have been diagnosed as bi-polar and placed on medications, if he was alive today. In addition to his violent mood swings, the King alienated his wife due to his debauched lifestyle. He was a frequent visitor to brothels and had relationships with prostitutes.

Right away we see how out of control Christian is, when he humiliates Caroline, while she's playing the harpsichord in front of members of the court. The uncouth Christian comments on her ""fat thighs"" and she flees the room in tears. Eventually, Caroline must endure having sex with Christian in order to produce an heir. The second act concerns the appearance of a German national, Johann Friedrich Struensee, who becomes the King's personal physician and confidante. The affair that develops between Caroline and Struensee is rather perfunctory. Bored and disgusted by Christian, she turns to the German physician after she's attracted to his liberal world view (Struensee is a proud promoter of the Enlightenment, the liberal philosophy sweeping Europe at the time).

Eventually, Struensee gains influence over Christian and convinces him to dismiss the conservative council which basically rules the country. For a short time, Struensee is in charge, and issues new, progressive laws, that enrage the conservative coterie of landholders. Struensee ends up getting his head chopped off after the conservatives intimidate the king, who ends up signing a warrant for his arrest. Caroline is deported to a Danish colony in Germany, where she ends up contracting scarlet fever and dies at the very young age of 25.

In the closing narration, we learn that Christian's son, King Frederick, eventually re-institutes many of Struensee's reforms and is hailed as a progressive hero. According to Wikipedia, Frederick did indeed issue progressive laws while he was regent and his father was still alive. But after he became king, he reverted to conservatism and sided with the monied interests.

'A Royal Affair' is an extremely well-made film about quite an interesting period in Danish history. Do not expect many fireworks when it comes to the actual affair between Caroline and the doctor. The two principals have little chemistry together. But the king's personality and the politics are fascinating and the film is beautifully photographed. 'A Royal Affair' well deserves it's ranking by the Academy as Best Foreign Film.",1374537600,,3410,5.098566308243727

The writing seemed natural. The king is described as ""schizophrenic"" but he's clearly NOT schizophrenic. Maybe schizotypal (if that makes any difference to you). The story itself is compelling. It was easy to get drawn into it. If you like human stories, this will probably appeal to you.

However, were we supposed to be sympathetic to the doctor? Sure he has enlightenment ideals, but he instituted them in completely manipulative and power-grabbing ways. He slept with the wife of a friend who trusted him, no matter if he was mad. That makes it worse actually, as the King was his patient. Then Streunsee took over all the power from the cabinet, and kicked everyone off of it but himself and the king, and then made the king sign over all power to him. Struensee abused and used the King for his own ends. The movie acts as if Struensee empowered Christian to be a true King, when all he really did was use him as a puppet to accomplish his own agenda. Nevermind that his agenda was enlightened; it was thoughtlessly, drastically, and dictatorially enforced, in a way that seemed to do more harm then good. And (although understandable in one sense) I saw nothing particularly attractive or captivating about the affair between him and Caroline. It just seemed like two self-consumed people destructively following their own passions at the expense of everybody else.

I'm reacting to the framing of the movie as a letter from Caroline, justifying her actions to her children. But basically her account seems to show that all the accusations were true, except for the actual plot to kill the king. And the movie ends with the implication that Frederik was inspired to follow in Streunsee's footsteps, when the actual storyline of the movie really portrayed Struensee's (dubious) methods rather than his ideals.

Of course, as I said above, I know nothing about the real character of Struensee or the actual way things occurred. I am only reacting to how they were portrayed in this movie. So, I enjoyed the movie, because I thought it portrayed the sad realities of politics, reform, and palace intrigue.

5466001,5,B00APOQR4E,"This Danish film tells a harrowing tale of political machination, sexual intrigue and revolutionary zeal that accompanied one of the country's most tempestuous periods: the era of the mad King Christian VII where everything is possible. The main players in this comic opera made for history are a king in the advanced stages of syphillis, a Prussian court doctor who likes reading Voltaire and had an eye for the queen, and the royal courtiers who feel aggrieved that their power is being eroded by an outsider preying on the affections of their king. It is the eighteenth century and the age of reason is only just starting to break through into the tyrannically-run courts of Denmark: the nation still allows, serfdom, favours authoritarian rule, and taxes the life out of the common folk. Change is the air, however, and it is about to come about by a crazy monarch and his idealistic doctor forming the most improbable alliance to shake a nation out of its stupor. But as the film shows, this would never have happened unless the good Dr. Struensee had not formed a liaison with Queen Caroline who was a prominent advocate for reform in her own right. The relationship blossoms into a love affair that leads to the doctor strangely gaining the confidence of the crazy kings and taking over the running of the nation's affairs. With the age of enlightenment finally arrived in Copenhagen, one can be sure that traditional forces will push back big time. Revolutions are just like that. What starts out as an ideal, morphs into an idea, only to become a chain of uncontrollable events usually resulting in unintended consequences and tragic outcomes. This film very masterfully covers this history by representing the often strange and violent course of history a nation has to take to come of age. While there is plenty of political and personal romance packed into this story, political tyranny, fear, and corruption are equally compelling opponents in the fight for the hearts and minds of the people. If revolutions have any value, it is the process of change that they start that is often completed long after the turbulence is over.

At the Danish court, however, looking at the troubled king's erratic behavior, Caroline realizes that her marriage will be a disaster. She was not as lucky as the young Queen Victoria.

The debauched king gets ill, and a skilled doctor and radical thinker Johann Friedrich Struensee (charismatic Mads Mikkelsen) is called in. That's where the story becomes really interesting. While acting as the King's advisor in political matters, Struensee starts having an affair with the Queen.

I hear everyone in Denmark knows these historical events. Set in the late 1760s and early 70s (about two decades before the French Revolution), ""A Royal Affair"" offers an engaging look at a unique era in Danish history, when so many progressive ideas were put into practice. Interestingly, the historical events also served as a basis of a 1935 British film ""The Dictator"" with Clive Brook as Struensee. Does anyone know where I can see it?

Mads Mikkelsen is compelling as ever (and he once again gives an outstanding performance in the same year's intense drama ""Jagten""). With slick storytelling and powerful acting, ""A Royal Affair"" entertains as a historical drama and romance.",1369526400,,1409,5.28125

But in the end, I kept hoping for some redemption of all the sadness and tragedy, and there was none. Illness, death, betrayal, loss, and grief are the theme of this movie.

5466022,4,B00APOQR4E,"Up for an Oscar for best foreign language film, this Danish import delves into the true story of a British noblewoman betrothed to King Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Folsgaard).  Destined to never see England again Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander) is charged with delivering an heir to the throne.  The problem is that the young king is a bit shy and a bit touched in the head.  He is controlled by a counsel of advisors who pass restrictive laws and just tell the King to sign them.

In what appears to be a rare opportunity, the new Queen entices Christian to perform and they manage to produce a healthy boy.  A couple of displaced Danish nobles are diplomats in Germany and convince Dr. Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen) that he should become the King's personal physician.  King Christian and Dr. Struensee become quickly connected as the doctor accepts the King's odd behavior.  As comely Caroline must remain chaste while her husband engages prostitutes, her connection with the handsome doctor portend problems ahead, both romantically and politically.

While Struensee and the Queen conduct their clandestine affair, the King listens more and more to Struensee's counsel over the objections of the collective advisors.  Together Struensee and Christian remove arcane obstacles to freedom like censorship.  When the Queen becomes pregnant again, she must entice the King to visit her bedroom, long neglected.

Adapted from Bodil Steensen-Leth's novel, director Nikolaj Arcel delivers a beautiful film.  Glorious photography (Rasmus Videbaek) flows throughout the film.  Excellent costumes and the elaborate sets distance the film from lesser efforts.  The film certainly has its soap opera moments but who cares.  The intrigue of the various interwoven plots, secrets and betrayals give the film an almost thriller feel, especially in the final act.  Even with an R rating the film eschews gory violence and even the bedroom scenes are not very explicit.  Well done.",1368489600,2,1973,5.252396166134186

5466038,3,B00APOQR4E,"A 15-year-English girl of royal descent is married off in 1766 to her cousin in Denmark, a country still stuck in many ways in the mediaeval era, a nation with a repressive system of government where peasants have no right and can be treated like animals. There's a slight problem with her new husband: he is mentally ill. The king hires free-thinking German doctor Johann Friedrich Struensee as his personal physician. You know what's coming next -- the queen falls in love with Struensee, who gradually takes over more and more control and is soon running Denmark. He introduces a series of laws to make the peasants' lives easier, thereby angering the Royal Court, who plot their revenge. The film is beautifully shot and features some good performances, but at 2 hours and 17 minutes is half an hour too long. We have one too many scenes of the king's advisers over-ruling him; the other challenge is that Struensee never really comes to life. We don't know what drives him and -- crucially -- we don't see how his many changes improve the life of average citizens, who remain largely off screen.

This production has a memorable cast, extraordinary scenery, fabulous artistic direction and agile direction.

5466066,3,B00APOQR4E,"There are some high points and low points to this film:

The Good:

-Getting to root for Mads Mikkelsen as the good guy as opposed to being slightly uncomfortable at one's strong attraction to the villain (a la Casino Royale).
-Alicia Vikander is visually appealing and while she falls just a tad short of Keira Knightley level charisma (the princess of period dramas doesn't have to fear for her crown just yet) -- she still does a lovely job with the material.
-Mikkel Flsgaard gives a heartbreaking performance as the mad king.  Repugnant at times, he still manages to generate tons of empathy as a man with the mental ability of a 13 year-old, manipulated by everyone around him, even his closest friend.  His performance is reason enough to watch this movie.

The Not-As-Good:

-Mads Mikkelsen's performance is at times too internal.  I wouldn't call him wooden.  He just never lets us in enough during the pivotal love scenes for us to become truly enmeshed in the love story.
-The chemistry in the sex scenes is hot; the love scenes are tepid and not all that believable for a movie called ""A Royal Affair.""  On the other hand, perhaps that is rather telling: the real ""affair"" here is the protagonists' quest to create a better Denmark.  And that is indeed compelling to watch.
-The whole movie has a rather fated quality to it.  You watch the characters make stupidly poor decisions at times and may find yourself shouting at Struensee in particular, ""You're smart enough to force social progress but can't be bothered to watch your own ass in a royal court?""  The inevitable denouement is frustrating because there's an overwhelming feeling that the characters could have changed the outcome of their own fates.  I would have liked to see the filmmakers pit them against a real antagonist, not the lazily bumbling council members who finally get around to tackling them.  The only really scary one is the manipulative Queen Dowager, but she's not given enough of an arc to make it seem like she was the true architect of their losses.

Summary: if you're looking for an 18th century fancy-dress movie where you'll get really wrapped up in the lives of the characters, rent ""The Duchess"" instead.  If you're interested in learning more about the history of the Danish royal family and the evolution of the country's progressive attitude to its internal affairs, check this movie out.",1365033600,6,2392,4.825980392156863

5466068,5,B00APOQR4E,"The Danes have done it again! A ROYAL AFFAIR (En kongelig affre)  is  a brilliantly  executed and performed step back into history  that succeeds on every level.  Based on historical fact and the  Bodil Steensen-Leth novel `Prinsesse af blodet' as adapted for the screen by Rasmus Heisterberg and writer/director Nikolaj Arcel, it blossoms from the opening touching moments to the grand and gory closure.

The story can be summarized as follows: In 1767, the British Princess Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander) is betrothed to the strange and deranged King Christian VII of Denmark (Mikkel Boe Flsgaard), but her life with the near bipolar monarch in the dank and dark kingdom becomes oppressive: Caroline is disliked by the dowager queen Juliane (Trine Dyrholm) and her confidant Ove Hegh-Guldberg (David Dencik) who both would prefer Christian be de-throned, and Caroline must submit to the somewhat distracted and loony acting king on her first night in the palace - but the king's interest soon lags for want of prostitutes and frivolous parties. However, Christian soon gains a fast companion with the German Dr. Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelson), a quietly idealistic man of the Enlightenment. As the only one who can influence the King, Struensee is able to begin sweeping enlightened reforms of Denmark through Christian even as Caroline falls for the doctor. However, their secret affair proves a tragic mistake that their conservative enemies use to their advantage in a conflict that threatens to claim more than just the lovers as their victims.

The cast is extraordinarily fine, not only the three main characters (Mikkel Boe Flsgaard finds just the right delicate balance for Christian's moments of sanity and flights of lunacy) but all members of the court and the masses of people living in the last country to move into the age of equality of all peoples.  The story is beautifully photographed by Rasmus Videbk, the stunning costumes are by Manon Rasmussen and the important musical score is in the capable hands of Gabriel Yared and Cyrille Aufort. Though the film is lengthy it is so rich in history and passion that it moves very quickly.  Highly recommended, especially for lovers of historical drama.

5466069,4,B00APOQR4E,"Good movie about a piece of Danish history that I was unaware of. It was told well, and the acting was great. I only wish they had included more about the young prince who would later turn things around for the better once again.",1365033600,,229,4.2272727272727275
5466070,3,B00APOQR4E,"I had heard so much about A Royal Affair that I was almost frothing at the mouth when I popped the DVD into my DVR. Unfortunately, it didn't really do it for me. That is not to say this isn't a beautiful film with costumes to die for... because it has all that. What this movie didn't have for me was passion. I never felt that Caroline was really there emotionally as a character. King Christian VII of Denmark is emotionally disturbed but strangely loveable. He isn't cruel or unfeeling, he just doesn't want to be king, or may he doesn't want any responsibilities. Doctor Struensee is tossed into the royal court because King Christian likes him, or rather Dr. Struensee knows how to deal with the king.

As the film progresses Caroline, the queen, has a long love affair with the doctor, and between the two of them they ""manage"" the King to begin enacting reforms for Denmark. The realization that this movie is based on fact was a major selling point for me. That the events happened is not so surprising. I mean, there was a reason the common folk rebelled and overthrew most of the monarchs in the world. They were either so inbred as to be mentally challenged or so removed from the needs of their population and inept that the populace was willing to try anything new.

So, as with everything, this is based on my opinion. It could have done with a tad more passion between the actors.",1364947200,11,1395,4.488188976377953

It's a fascinating look at how the basic foundations we all grew up around (at least here in America) like all men are created equal, were considered way ahead of its time and revolutionary back then. Add to that, a foreigner like Struensee, being the proposer of such reforms, and an increasingly hostile conservative and obsolete staff with pretty much absolute power what with an easily manipulated King, I think it's a terrific historical drama with much relevance to today's times in terms of politics.

5466085,5,B00APOQR4E,"A Royal Affair is a fabulous dramatization of a true story about Caroline Mathilde, a younger sister of  King George III of England who was wed to the unstable King Christian of Denmark at the ages of 15 and 17 respectively. If this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, then you know where this story is headed.
The young Queen quickly finds out that she has married a bit of a whack-job, but endears herself to Denmark by quickly providing a royal heir.
Her loony King Christian then announces that he is leaving for an extended tour of Europe, to which she replies the Danish equivalent of ""So? What do I care?"". Oh, did I forget to mention that this film is in Danish with English subtitles? They would actually have been speaking German in the Danish Court of the time, but it's a Danish film so let's not quibble about that.
Christian brings back a certain German Dr. Johann Struensee with him from his Grand Tour, who as well as befriending and acting as a calming influence on the young King, brings some radical notions to Denmark like smallpox vaccination, freedom for serfs and the abolition of torture. He is able to use the King's power to drag Denmark into the ""modern era"" of The Enlightenment. This film takes place around the time of the American and French Revolutions to give some context.
Dr. Struensee finds a kindred spirit for his progressive ideas in the young Queen and, well, let's just say that the history books seem to agree that her second child, a daughter, was fathered by the good doctor!
If you enjoy a gorgeous, slow political romance then this is your film. Just make sure you see it with someone who is also into that kind of film. The Squire (my husband) was OK with this one but only just! :)",1361664000,17,1735,4.507936507936508
5466086,5,B00APOQR4E,"The subtlety of Per Olov Enquist's novel The Royal Physician's Visit is rivalled, in another genre, by this historically faithful and beautifully produced movie. It convinces you at a visceral level that absolute monarchy was not a good idea. The movie fully gets across what a marvelous feat were the young German physician Johann Struensee's Rousseau- and Voltaire-inspired reforms when he reached a position of power through intimacy with the mentally unstable young King of Denmark. The love affair between Struensee and the Queen is intensely romantic and suspenseful, and likely to send the viewer on a quest for more movies in which the principal actor is Mads Mikkelsen. Too bad this terrific movie was not shown for a longer time, and in more movie theaters, across the U.S.  I look forward to Mikkelsen's next movie, The Hunt--to reading more Enquist novels--and to finding out more about the doctor, statesman, and lover Johann Struensee.",1360454400,9,949,5.162337662337662

5466088,4,B00APOQR4E,"A ROYAL AFFAIR at first looks like its going to be a film that focuses on the marriage between Caroline Mathilde and the Danish King Christian VII, but the film is not really about this arranged marriage so much as it is about the friendship that develops between the Danish king and a small town German physician, Johann Streunsee, who Christian meets while on a European tour. Virtually everyone in the Danish court treats the king as if he were suffering from some form of mental illness, but whether they really believe he is mentally ill or whether this is merely a convenience that allows them to ignore his political will and exert their own, is never altogether clear. Whatever it is that the king lacks, however, is filled perfectly by the German doctor who seems to be the only person who has ever made any attempt to get to know him. The two get along wonderfully. With Streunsee as a companion and tutor, Christian becomes far more sociable and far more confident in his own opinions and thus far more effective as a king. This friendship is by far the most interesting and moving relationship in the film. So when the doctor begins an affair with the King's beautiful wife, Mathilde (who remains only a partially developed character here), we are intrigued but this relationship, the royal affair, remains relatively secret to all but a few while Struensee and Christian together transform Denmark into an Enlightened country (or at least come very near to doing so). However, since this is the 1760's, the Danish nobility feels threatened by Struensee's authority/power which they righfully perceive to be undermining their own authority/power, so they decide to retaliate to save themselves and the country (or at least their version of it) before its too late. ""The Royal Affair"" is just the scandal they need to turn the people (and perhaps Christian himself) against the ""dangerous foreigner"" Struensee. Its an excellent and true story but it is based on two separate sources (one that focuses on the doctor's story and the other that focuses on the queen's) and the film never completely resolves its twin interests and this results is some narrative confusion: The film is framed as the queen's story (beginning and ending with the writing and delivery of her memoirs to her children) but the bulk of the film is dedicated to the doctor's story (and we are much more invested in his story than we are in hers by films end as he is the more remarkable character played by the more remarkable actor). Viewers will likely forgive the film this minor flaw as its such a sumptuous and intriguing Enlightenment ride. And I suspect the thing that will linger in the viewer's mind days after the film is over is not the affair (which was fairly generic) but the relationship between the lonely king and his remarkable friend.

5466089,5,B00APOQR4E,"Swedish cinema (Danish colaboration) continues to show us what our movies, sometimes, only wish they could be - with just a fraction of the budget.  This is so much more than costume drama and is based on true events.  Whether you like political intrigue, the progress of human freedoms, costume drama or star crossed love, this movie will impress.

Early 1770's - Young, progressive English Princess Caroline Mathilda is sent to Denmark as the bride of King Christian VII.  Her teenage romantic hopefulness is answered almost immediately in her first meeting with the young king who seems foppish and immature as a young child at the very best.  Her early fears are confirmed as the young king appears to be mad and is manipulated and marginalized by his corrupt counsel.  The archaic, essentially still feudal, system is causing the people to suffer and die while corruption funnels away the county's finances into ruin.

Enter a German Doctor Struensee.  He is brought to court to help control the king's wilder behavior in spite of his views on human rights and ideas about modern governance (which he initially keeps secret).  He finds that being a friend to the king and showing a modicum of respect actually helps calm him and moderates his loathfull behavior to the queen.  Queen Caroline then finds that the very one she thought was her enemy is actually her best ally, like mind, confidant, and eventually lover.  The older doctor can of course not resist a woman so beautiful, young and of high standing that he could never dream to win.

Their alliance, along with several other courtiers brought in, helps to seize control from the corrupt council and begins to affect policies of good governance which benefit the people immensely.  The ""how"" is very engaging and the entire process is an epoch and a treat.  Sacrifices are made along the way and one might ask if it was all worth it.  The policies enacted by Denmark were noted by great thinkers you would immediately recognize and were a shining light in Europe which was itself in turmoil of great change.  This movie was beautiful and romantic.  Yet, it also makes one ask questions of themselves at different points.  I wondered where my thought would have fallen back then.  I am a moderate conservative.  However, the principles of governance and human rights proposed at this period were considered very radical and progressive for their time.

Again, I asked myself if the sacrifices were worth it.  But, Struensee won the love of a beautiful young queen , became primary consul of a nation, and changed the world.  He is immortalized.  What would one give for that?

This is a shining example of what Swedish (and other Nordic countries) are accomplishing with their cinema right now. Stories of great depth and character development that Hollywood often refuses to attempt.  Only after movies like ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" or ""Battle Royal"" (Japanese), Hunger Games as we know it, gain such world acclaim does Hollywood come back and copy them.  I love the two Holywood productions I just mentioned, but it took someone else proving their value before they were willing to do stories like that.

Alicia Vikander is hauntingly charming as Caroline, not so exotic that it's excessive.  In other words - perfect.  Mads Mikkelsen has so many terrific roles to his credit I should hardly even have to mention it.  Yet, his role as a marginally attractive, slightly older man that wins a queen with ideas is completely beleivable, never overdone.",1358726400,8,3520,4.89527027027027

5466091,5,B00APOQR4E,"Yet again another fantastic film from Denmark with over two hours of absorbing drama. Period dramas from the 18th Century are not my favourite pieces but this certainly held me captive.
The little known story of King Christian of Denmark who is a little insane and his marriage to his English queen who succumbs to his German physician Straunsee is wonderfully told with excellent attention to period detail.
The film is mostly in Danish with English subtitles although there a couple of scenes in English at the beginning of the film.
Viewers of recent Danish TV drama acquisitions will recognise a number of faces in this film including Sren Malling (Torben Friis - Borgen / Jan Meyer - The Killing), Sren Spanning (PM Lars Hesselboe - Borgen / Kornerup - The Killing), Bent Mejding (Mayor Poul Bremer - The Killing) as well as David Dencik and Mikkel Boe Flsgaard who have both appeared in Those Who Kill. The star of the piece Mads Mikkelsen plays his role as the German physician very well. Mads can also be seen in Danish series Unit One out on DVD in Jnuary 2013.
If you like Danish films or have an interest in European history then this is ideal for you. Well worth a rewatch.
It is also interesting to see how different the role of Christiansborg Palace has become from the 18th Century to the 21st Century Borgen as we see it today with PM Birgitte Nyborg.",1357516800,92,1367,4.60655737704918
