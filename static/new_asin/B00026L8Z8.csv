I would suggest you go to your local blockbuster and rent this or buy it because i gurantee you it will be the greatest experience you will ever have. Watching this film is liek staring into the face of God and seeing him smiling back at you saying, you are my most wonderous creation. I am born anew in its genious.",1086998400,,490,4.395604395604396
8022855,4,B00026L8Z8,"First off, I gave 4 stars for the entertainment value, not because this is a good movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the God awful acting and effects. I also loved the Zack Morris look alike, that dude was hilarious. Anyone wanting to learn about how to not make a movie should watch this. I will say, I liked the legend about the witch, it just wasn't executed well at all.",1457568000,,367,4.333333333333333
8022856,5,B00026L8Z8,"If you look you'll see that this incredible piece of crap is selling for $21.99 here on Amazon. The people that made the Fanglys should have to pay everyone that tried to watch it at least double lol. We got through most of it I think but decided the featurette  in the extras would have to be better. Believe it or not it was WORSE! Yes, no kidding. The director comes off as a seasoned film guy but fails really bad. The best scene in the film was, uuhhhh, hmmmm, well there wasn't one:) The worst scene in the film was the film hahahaha. If you have a couple of hours of your life to throw away by all means go buy this sucker except then you'll be the sucker...along with the rest of us that believed the dvd cover. To some this film up...lololololololol!!!!!! Oh, I tried not to give this flop any stars at all but I have to so I'll go ahead and give it one.",1225238400,,863,4.106508875739645
8022857,1,B00026L8Z8,"This was the most craptastic horror movie I have ever seen. This made movie night at my friends house the loudest and most raucous night ever. If you have no sense of humor do not watch this movie. It appears to be a film student's failing midterm. The description mentions a ""clan"" of cannabalistic hillbillies; apparently ""clan"" means two ""people"".

So terribly bad that I must warn anyone who is being dared to watch it (that should be the only reason, and then only if you are getting paid a good sum, otherwise its not worth it) DO NOT EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING THAT WON'T TASTE GOOD THROUGH YOUR NOSE; YOU'LL BE LAUGHING SO HARD YOU WANT TO DIE.

Yea, it's that bad.",1124236800,3,668,4.4227642276422765
8022858,1,B00026L8Z8,"It really doesn't deserve the one star I HAD to give it...come to think of it, had I the choice, I would have given it 5 NEGATIVE stars!  Absolutely HORRENDOUS...how this thing was even released to the general public I don't know.  I usually hate it when people give reviews like this, but those of you who have seen it should understand.  If I didn't know better (and, come to think of it, I DON'T!) I would think this was a slightly above average high school film class student film.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  DON'T EVEN RENT IT!!!",1122768000,,528,4.402061855670103
8022859,1,B00026L8Z8,"Corny acting, corny ""special affects""...horrible plot. The 1 star is for the retard eating flesh off a bone. And can anyone answer what the hell kinda animal was in the cage?",1111968000,,174,4.645161290322581
8022860,1,B00026L8Z8,"I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST, WORST, WORST, ...DID I SAY... FRIGGREN WORST, WORST, WORST, WORST,...OH HECK I'LL SAY IT AGAIN...THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!  MAKES ME WONDER WHY FOLKS WASTE THEIR TIME BOTHERING MAKING A MOVIE!  CHRIST I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER FILMING THIS AND IM BLIND, DEAF, AND MUTE... AND HAVE NO ARMS OR FEET!  GET THE POINT! :) HAHAHAHA!",1110585600,,375,4.485294117647059
8022861,2,B00026L8Z8,"I gave it an extra star for the leg (femur bone) scene, other than that: bad footage, bad sound, bad acting, bad special effects, bad story line, bad title....

not worth a rental (however not as bad as half caste)",1094342400,,214,4.35
8022862,3,B00026L8Z8,"i love low budget flicks!! so in my opinion anything BAD about this movie has nothing to do with the quality of the camera/actors or the size of the budget itself.  the problem is in the story & the setting. first off the story is toooo jumpy for a low budget flick there are to many""MEANWHILE BACk AT THE RANCH"" scense!! some scenes were VERY VERY clever & then some scenes were just rediculously unrealistic & not scary or funnnny!!the makeup for FANGLADY was great don't get me wrong but some of the special efx in the ending scene were just to much for the budget if you know what i mean(while everything else looks low budget they save all there money for a special effect that knocks the movie off the train tracks i mean if you have a movie about a redneck cannibal family keep it that way don't add STUPID DUMMMMM magic 80s special efx!!! low budget means RAW keep it that way!!!!!!!!!!!!) & as far as the  setting goes the movie gave me no feelings of isolation at all it felt like it was all done in someone's back yard!????! the trees were way to far apart for it to look anything like deep isolated woods & the ("")(un"") spooky road that you drive down to get a glimpse of FANGLADY!??? sorry didn't fool me its not even a road horror fans it looks like someone's dirt drive way!!???? bottom line is that this movie could have been much BETTER!??! 50% CREATIVE TO THE BONE but the other 50% IS SO DUMMMMMM THAT IT RUINS IT FOR ME !! BUT THATS JUST ME!!???!! p.s. if you want a goooofy/retarded/scary/funny bone pinchen/laugh fest of a great  indy low budget horror flick then i recomend ""REDNECK ZOMBIES"" LATER ON FELLOW HORROR FANS!!!!!!!",1089072000,,1649,4.417763157894737
