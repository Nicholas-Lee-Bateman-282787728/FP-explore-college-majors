1976377,2,B00018J9VW,"I bought this dvd along with the book - I like a visual aid to exercise with, as it keeps a flow, and helps ensure you're doing things properly - and a text sometimes gives you deeper info.  I found the book good, lots of info there.  The DVD could have been good, but it is too difficult to follow along for a total beginner.  There is no commentary whatsoever.  Which means that even when you should be looking another way, you have to watch the screen constantly to know if it's time to do something else.  I have an enormous collection of workout DVDs, and this has one of the laziest productions I have ever seen.  With the technology available on DVD, there should have been an option to have a voiceover or not.  Thus, one could learn with the voiceover, and later practice without it for a more zen session.  I though at the very least there would be titles on the screen each time a new movement was introduced, but no, nothing.....  pity.  I shall have to stick with my Garripoli DVDs.",1188691200,27,995,4.3297297297297295
1976378,5,B00018J9VW,"Qigong (Chi Kung) is a Chinese art and science that means working with and cultivating the vitality of life. This DVD is an outstanding method to learn this ancient and modern tradition for staying young, healthy, and in harmony with yourself and the world around you.

This DVD's many exercises are simple and easy to do--everything is clear and to the point.  An added feature is that Shoshanna Katzman (both author and person doing the movements) does not talk as she does them.  Any discussion comes after.

Yet paradoxically the DVD is encyclopedic in its coverage. Shoshanna has studied for many years with masters and has made a vast wealth of practical knowledge easily available to anyone who wants to learn.

The DVD may be used alone, but there is a book, Qigong for Staying Young by Shoshanna Katzman that is a wonderful addition. I strongly suggest getting them both. It could be the best purchase you ever make.",1161302400,20,925,4.7924528301886795
1976379,5,B00018J9VW,"An EXCELLENT Primer to every QiGong and/or T'ai Chi Practitioner and Teacher ! ! ! A must have indeed.
Don't miss this wonderfully and well researched QiGong DVD (w/ accompanying GuideBook)written and produced by concurrent NQA (National QiGong Association, USA)President, Acupuncturist, T'ai Chi and QiGong Master Shoshanna Katzman. In one word, 'Awesome'. Everyone in Hollywood must have a copy of this expertly produced DVD. Congratulations ! May the Power of the Universal Qi bring more gifts your way.
The one thing that I enjoy the most are the 5-Healing QiGong. Get a Copy and you will get the benefit of it too. Trust me.
Shalom ! En Sh'allah ! Mabuhay ! Exelente ! Superiore' .  .  .",1084492800,35,692,4.905982905982906

8007790,5,B00018J9VW,"I bought the book, it explains all the poses. The video is just her doing the moves. It's kind of hard to pick it up - but it can be done. I feel so calmed and energized afterward. I haven't done it daily but I know that if I do it'll be immensely rewarding.
Btw I am 23. These exercises work for me when I want something slow and easy. But sometimes I do yoga when I want something more intense. It's great for women of all ages!",1487289600,,430,3.897727272727273
8007791,5,B00018J9VW,"Very good exercise tape, very easy to follow.",1482192000,,45,4.75
8007792,4,B00018J9VW,"I bought the book years ago, then found there was a video tape.  Now that my vcr has died, I ordered the dvd.  It's exactly as the tape is, even though it's been years since I got it.  It's worth getting the book to go with it, as it explains much more than the dvd does.  There's enough on the dvd to get you started and enable  you to be able to learn and do it on your own.  The one two-week time period that I was able to do this every day, I felt wonderful and full of energy.  Try doing it facing different directions and at different times of the day for different results!",1373155200,3,580,3.9482758620689653
8007793,5,B00018J9VW,"This video clearly shows how simple the movements are in this form of exercise.  It's easy to watch and follow.  You know, getting started with any form of exercise is tough but this program makes it possible for ""couch potatoes"" to start improving their health.",1359331200,,262,4.8
8007794,2,B00018J9VW,"As a long time martial artist and Qigong practitioner; I have to say this DVD is awful.  In the warm up section the hip rotations are done far too quickly and the demonstrator looks really stressed out.
The woman doesn't say one word throughout the entire DVD!  There are many good Qigong DVD's; this is not one of them.",1318204800,6,320,4.406779661016949
8007795,5,B00018J9VW,"I LOVE this DVD.  I purchased it along with the book.  The book definitely helps understanding the moves and for learning to practice the moves correctly.  It has a TON of very useful information!!!  The DVD itself is a lovely practice in a wooded, serene setting.  There is no talking -- just Nature, qigong, and a quiet, oriental-sounding music background.  Heavenly!!!  Once you learn the routine, which is about 20 minutes long, you can practice all or parts of it on your own to your own pace.  I like to practice outside like Shoshanna does in the DVD.  You can feel the qi warming your hands, and eventually feel it in your body.  She covers all the bases -- warm up, waking up qi; tapping for qi; five healing sounds; playing with qi; qi mind, qi body; energize endocrines; knitting strong bones; nourishing three treasures (my personal favorite!) and warm-down, closing the circle.

I was a beginner coming to this DVD/book and I was able to completely benefit from them.  I took the time to learn from the book and practice with the DVD.  It is a very enjoyable, loving experience for myself.  I just feel really good from practicing this qigong with Shoshanna.",1291075200,6,1171,4.676470588235294
8007796,3,B00018J9VW,"I first bought the book Qigong for Staying Young and then felt that I needed to see the exercises being done to get them exactly right, so I ordered the DVD. On the DVD, the author demonstrates the session, but without any instruction at all, no explanation of how the breathing should coordinate with the movement, or of the visualizations mentioned in the book. The viewer is left to guess at what the healing sounds are if it's not entirely clear from Katzman's pronunciation. It would have been ideal as a previous reviewer mentioned, if there was a soundtrack guiding you through the first times that could then be shut off, but as it is, it is inadequate by itself to understand the exercises, and in light of this, $25 is far too much to pay for the DVD. It should have been packaged together with the book. That all being said, I do like the workout very much....",1228953600,21,871,4.484276729559748
8007797,5,B00018J9VW,"I've read the book, Qigong for Staying Young and practiced the set  Shoshanna Katzman describes in great detail in the book. What I wanted was a video that I could practice with, not a video that takes the time to reiterate the philosophy and details found in the book. This video is perfect for that need. Katzman leads me through the exercises each morning. She does the exercises in a lovely green forest, which itself is soothing and in winter will give me a dose of summer. There's also inobtrusive music that complements the movements and mood. Thanks, Shoshanna Katzman, for helping me help my 60 year old body feel better each day.",1224460800,7,639,4.654867256637168
8007798,5,B00018J9VW,"This well written and detailed instruction is fabulous especially when combined with the DVD of the same name.  Fun and great to share with others, family & friends!",1213315200,2,165,4.892857142857143
