-The DVD and compact pamphlet sized tab is perfect. Pamphlet its in the guitar case neck pocket.
- The split screen and anecdotal chord voicing/fingering discussions are at a good intermediate level. Might bore guitar pros, but he does a good gob of referring viewers to the tab as opposed to spending too much time on the simplest stuff.
- Like Fred's intro stories and direct connection with the 1960's Jerry Garcia and GD. The cousin's Banjo Teacher Jerry story for example, is great.
- Fred generally glues his pinky and ring finger to the pick guard.  So although his arrangements are advertised as fingerstyle, there's nothing stopping a guy or gal from using a pick with middle and ring finger dedicated to the melodic accents in most of his arrangements. This ends up being kinda Jerry-esque without going through the palming the pick hassle.

Some songs come alive (Alabama Getaway, Deal, Truckin') come alive in his arrangements, and are good foundations for jamming (especially when they are in keys/chord voicings true to the performed versions). Others are just solid standards (FOTD, UJB, Ripple). My least favorite is Sugar Magnolia (in C Major!) - maybe he felt he had to include a Bob song. Touch of Grey is kinda creative, and you can capo up his Key of D major transcription for a play-with-the-recording feel.

For someone who is sick of strumming open chords and wants to start journeying up the neck for alternative voicings, Fred does a good get-your-feet-wet job for you in this DVD. Guaranteed free of mixolydian discussions though. Even with all the guys on You Tube sitting in their bedrooms, this one is still worth the money imo.",1428451200,2,1665,4.876325088339223
