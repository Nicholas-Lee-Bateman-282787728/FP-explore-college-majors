8465411,5,B005CGN23O,What a great collection!  It's so nice to see all of these old shows and watch Dean martin in his original comedic personality.,1465862400,,127,4.521739130434782
8465412,1,B005CGN23O,"What seems to be a great listing of content...isn't. There are NO Dean Martin songs included (much like the Time Life DVDs) and most of the clips (such as the Bing Crosby and John Wayne segments) are lifted from previous DVD collections. They even cut all the songs from the public domain Sinatra Timex Special with Bing and Dean. Avoid with all cost, unless the cost is below a dollar. I can say that the clips with Groucho and Don Knotts are good.",1365724800,5,449,4.421686746987952
