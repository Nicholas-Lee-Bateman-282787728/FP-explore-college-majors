8559145,4,B00AY9V3I0,"Made for Canadian TV and NOT another conformist Hollywood bubble bath. Sometimes less is more. Too bad the general public are used to overly slick flicks with predictable plots which amount to little more than hollow, big budget eye candy.
This here is a minimalistic and pared down to its essence lower budget Indie thriller with unpredictable plotting even if it is a tad formulaic.
The story is not unrealistically overwrought like some other films that were made in the USA and cinematically released and hence better known than this modest little gem starring Mischa Barton who knows the value of understatement, i.e. not overacting/reacting like is often the case when an actor takes on a roll like this.

A solid 3 star movie that gains an extra star for having a uniquely different stylistic approach than USA TV movies and for Mischa Barton being, well, who she is which adds another unique flavor.",1510790400,,907,4.8896103896103895

8559147,4,B00AY9V3I0,"Cyberstalker (you'll more likely find this on DVD under the title Offline), isn't that bad for a stalker film.  It is obviously low budget and likely originally made for TV or straight to DVD, and follows the usual criteria when that is the case of a length of being around an hour and half in length, not having a lot of locations in the film and using mostly unknown actors with a former well known face actress from a popular TV show no longer on air, (in this case it's The O.C.'s  Mischa Barton).  This movie was made in 2012 six years after The O.C. and it first starts Mischa appears as (Aiden Ashley) a school girl and I thought there is no way she is passing as someone of school age years, but after some events play out in her parents house, we go to the present (13 years into the future).  Aiden is now living off the grid, paranoid under a new name and shuns anything with technology to avoid the stalker from the past ever catching up with her.  Although ridiculously she hasn't changed her first name.  She paints for a living is getting pressure from her art mentor and gallery owner to let him promote her work online.  Meanwhile an old man now cop is flicking through his old cold case file, and mentions to another officer how he wishes they had caught the guy and how Alicia has disappeared.  The other cop does a simple Google search and finds her online much to the old cop's amazement.  So he contacts her through her profile, of course the profile belongs to her obsessed stalker.

This is the type of film where you'll pretty quickly guess who her stalker actually is, it's more of a well let's see how this plays out before Aiden works it out type of viewing experience.  Sure it's a film where you constantly say out loud, as if you'd do that, or why if she's paranoid about security would you do that?  But it's a fun stalker film, where the stalker talks like The Joker from the old 1966 Batman TV show in the times we're just seeing his hands on the keyboard when we're not supposed to know his identity.",1463529600,,2035,4.3403693931398415
8559148,1,B00AY9V3I0,"This movie stunk! I thought it would be awesome, as the title and DVD cover looked like a psychological thriller. The acting was awful. I have seen some great made for TV films. This didn't compare at all. I honestly wonder if it was filmed in someone's basement. I am sorely disappointed.",1423958400,,289,4.576923076923077
8559149,5,B00AY9V3I0,I luv Mischa Barton.  This movie is amazeballs! It is a thriller loaded with twists!,1410307200,,84,4.6
8559150,2,B00AY9V3I0,"It was promising......Looked like it could be a good movie, however, much applause to the cover of the DVD and story line. Even the actors I have seen in much better movies. not so much this time. Very unmemorable acting, almost wooden and exhaustingly dull, to the point, I ask, How much more is left? Sounded like a winner, but for me, a disappointment.",1372377600,,355,4.5625

CYBER STALKER is suspenseful and basically watchable. The acting, script, and directions are as generic as the title, and, regardless of the fact that it's ""based on a true story,"" the ending is both corny and fairly predictable.

A few small complications here and there help make this film more or less worth it. Still, CYBER STALKER would have been greatly enhanced by more in the 1999 pre-story explaining--or at least giving a few hints--how/why the stalker became fixated on Aiden in the first place.",1367452800,,519,4.954022988505747
8559152,3,B00AY9V3I0,"You probably won't find this movie very memorable. It's a relatively mild Canadian import that looks as if it was filmed quickly to fill a made-for-TV time slot.

It follows a formula, trotting out the usual suspects. Which of the men in Aiden's life is the killer/stalker come back 13 years after his first atrocity to try once again to coerce the object of his desires into a relationship - or else? Is it her new suitor? Is it her good ""friend"" who has been bankrolling her artistic career in his gallery? Is it the computer geek who has been helping the police track down Aiden in her new identity? Is it the very attentive policeman himself - or one of his deputies? Or is it one of the bit players who appear only briefly at the edges of Aiden's life? If you've ever seen another film in this genre, you'll probably be able to guess ""who"" pretty readily.

A lot of this movie naturally focuses on tracking and counter-tracking people via the computer. Reference is made to one program that analyzes paintings on-line and identifies works done by the same artist. That's a particular point of interest and might cause the viewer to wonder if such a program really exists. I wish the movie had included more of this sort of inside information and had elaborated more realistically on cyber tracking techniques.

For all its failings though, this movie kept me passably entertained. If you have nothing better to do for an evening, you can make yourself a big bowl of popcorn, sit down, and briefly lose yourself in these characters' troubles and obsessions.",1363737600,3,1561,4.669090909090909
