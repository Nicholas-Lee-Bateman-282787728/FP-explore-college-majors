6798072,5,B00PF905U6,"If you like/love Babymetal you have to have this, no way around it. It is worth the price. Both complete shows with the special ending on Black night. These girls put on a show that is incredible. If you want to see them in a live show or think you never will you must watch this, it will excite your love for how talented they are. I have seen a lot of their youtube videos but none compare to what is on this Blu-ray. Get it before they are sold out.",1424044800,9,452,3.978021978021978

6798075,5,B00PF905U6,"The other BabyMetal blu-rays that I have seen do not have a live backing band. Budokan does, and let's be honest, BabyMetal with a live band is one of the most brilliant musical experiences you can ever hope to have. The quality of both concerts is superb, the performances magnificent. You will not be sorry you bought this disc and if you are lucky enough to have BabyMetal play a show near you, go see them.

Note: Legend 1997 & 1999 Apocalypse has the Kami band for about the last few songs of each performance. Live Legend I.D.Z. Apocalypse has them for the last few songs of the Z show.",1421798400,20,592,4.381818181818182

6798078,5,B00PF905U6,"What an awesome pair of concerts. This was one of the best directed concert films I have ever seen, shots from all over the arena and I'm not sure if the shaky cam shots were intended or not but it worked. It gives you the feeling of the bass hitting your body. BabyMetal and the Kami band definetly know how to put on one hell of a show.. This is definetly worth a purchase, now  only wish I could attend one of these shows in person some day.. ""Kitsunes Up""",1431388800,3,459,4.1
6798079,5,B00PF905U6,"First excuse any misspellings, typing from phone not computer.

This is a must have DVD ( even for the skeptics - which I once was ).  I remember the nonstop Facebook posts about this group and made fun of them like everybody else. 6 months ago I gave them a chance.  NOW I AM AN ADDICT!!!

I have spread the news to all my non internet connected ( computer illiterate / yes they exist ) friends with interesting results (4 addicts, 3 haters, 6 still peaking around the corner).  However no one can say anything bad about the entertainment value of this DVD.

The only question drawn is why one of the girls disappears during the song ""Headbanger"" on Red Night show.  After a quick internet search I discovered Yu-Metal fell off the stage ( though the DVD does not show the fall ).

However, this one incident proves these girls and the band are real troopers.  You can definitely hear a difference in the song and while roadies are attempting to get Yu-Metal ( unseen ) the band played on.

Ever song + 3 from their debut album is performed.  There are laser lights, fire balls, rising platforms, video screens, & everyone ( the girls & the band ) are all over it.  This is not your typical super sonic performance where the band is in the background and the girls are working the crowd.  Everybody is performing here.  No lip syncing, no pantomiming.

I could write more but eyes hurt and stylys keeps hitting wrong buttons.

Overall, just get this concert in some form or fashion.  You will not regret it.

And ijime, dame, zettai",1430956800,5,1533,4.472924187725631
6798080,5,B00PF905U6,Really enjoyed these dvds.,1428364800,,26,5.75
6798081,5,B00PF905U6,"As a still fairly new BabyMetal fan, this was fantastic! All of my favorite songs, performed by my favorite band. The quality was great! As a worker and a college student I knew I would not get to see them live here in the USA this year, but hopefully I will be able to sometime... for now this on a big screen TV has to suffice!

I am in the mood to do this thoroughly, so just two comments here. On the home screen you can choose Japanese or English. Of course I hit English hoping I'd get English subtitles under the beginning announcement scenes, etc. It didn't, but oh well! It's for the music anyway. Also a brief comment on the band performance itself. I love the girls' energy; it's a big part of what makes them so wonderful to watch. I understand that this will make singing for REAL very difficult! However, I am anxious to see some of their live performances from this year's tour, to see if lovely Su-Metal has worked on her vocal modulation a bit. She was so intense she almost yelled every note. While this was fine for most of the rocking K-Metal songs, ""Akatsuki"", etc. should definitely be softer now and then. Anyway, though, great DVD! I will always cherish it and have fun dancing along! KITSUNE UP.",1427673600,2,1220,4.398230088495575

6798083,5,B00PF905U6,Really good visual and audio. Performance spectacular! The girls are seasoned pro's.band is great. Well worth the money!,1426896000,,120,5.722222222222222
6798084,5,B00PF905U6,This is the best of the BabyMetal DVD's. Every song is better with the live band. The girls sing all the songs and you get to see the interaction with the crowd and the enthusiasm is tops. The Kami band really elevates the whole act and they are certainly very tight on these two back to back dates. The song Answer for Animation With You (one of my favorites) can't be better played than what they did in this live show. The sound is great for all the songs. I did not like the Budokan stage as there was no way to put the risers on for Moa & Yui so the visuals were a little different than most of their live shows. But if you are a fan of BabyMetal this is one DVD you want to put the money out for. You will also see the end of HeadBanger in the first show without Yui-metal because she had fallen off the stage. Su-metal and Moa-metal finish without her. She was apparently fine as she made the encore and the next days show. Again this is a great recording if you like this band buy it. Share this when you are trying to explain the BabyMetal phenomenon.,1426896000,7,1060,4.100961538461538
6798085,5,B00PF905U6,"It's exactly what you would expect, 2 live shows back to back. Highly recommended for a fan of Babymetal.",1425772800,,105,4.578947368421052
8687680,5,B00PF905U6,Watching these girls perform was as awesome as listening to their catchy beats. Definitely something I could watch a number of times.,1517356800,,133,5.090909090909091
8687681,5,B00PF905U6,"Lot's of great rock has been coming out of Japan for many years. America too; but America's creative scene (to me) has become a disorganized 'tower of Babble' incapable of creating large organically organized ""scenes"". It's no longer natural for the American market place to anoint ""leaders"" except in a few rare cases. No so in Japan; Japan (since it got over it's post-ww2 conservative ways) has been producing countercultures, in bulk and one after another, like a well-run factory. Babymetal (I gather) feels the need to revitalize Heavy Metal in Japan. Could be; If so, this is an excellent project. The under age girl dancers are daughters of the musicians? That's something I've never seen in a Heavy Metal band. I like it.",1477612800,,730,4.895161290322581
8687682,5,B00PF905U6,Great show Babymetal gives,1472601600,,26,5.75
8687683,5,B00PF905U6,"Discovered Babymetal via their ""Karate"" video.  Once Suzuka Nakamoto (Su-Metal) started singing, I was amazed! What a beautiful and talented young lady!  My initial thoughts about Yui and Moa were, ""what's with the little gal pals?"" I owe them both an apology.  After watching these concert videos, I can see that their boundless energy and enthusiasm is essential to the band.  If you are a member of the heavy metal Taliban, and want to behead anyone that isn`t a steroid-gobbling, multiply pierced and tattooed, scraggly-bearded, gutteral-groaning Viking wanna be, these concerts aren`t for you.  But if you like fun, energetic music, this is a must!",1462406400,2,653,5.180952380952381

8687685,5,B00PF905U6,"Okay, so I've had this item for several months now. I always let products sink in a little before I fully judge. This is a live dvd that is one word. AMAZING. where do I start?

Okay, first off. differences for the two dvds.

Red night. has two fewer songs. but to me the music is played more aggressively and the visuals were a tiny less well portrayed. while Black night, had a ""laid back"" sense compared to it. but they had backing dancers and the whole visual performance along with the closing ceremony made this night the more visual appealing.

I don't want to review each song because its your experience. and I do not want to ruin it. just know if you love babymetal and you love live. here is your ecstasy.",1447459200,,716,4.3283582089552235
8687686,5,B00PF905U6,"Right when I tought that fast tempo Metal, was something for hairy chested front men, I stumbled by chance on one of their songs on YouTube, and my jaw dropped. To see these three girls jump around, sing, and run all at the same time, and with so much energy is a real pleasure, and while some other similar bands are too gory for my taste, this vocal trio, add a sense of freshness to the style,while the guys at the back play their instruments real earthquake like. I am sure they will  have a long career in front of them, and I would recommend this band to anyone...",1447286400,,570,4.229357798165138
8687687,5,B00PF905U6,"I liked babymetal more after watching this. Brought this to a buddies house and the stage show made he and his daughter ask me if they were satanists.

The dancing/choreography , stage design, effects, backing Kami band, lighting, pyrotechnics were unbelievably on point.

And no, they are not satanists.",1438387200,,304,5.183673469387755
