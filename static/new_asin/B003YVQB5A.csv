8409805,5,B003YVQB5A,"Patrick Moore logically explains why ""Trees Are The Answer"". Having worked in the lumber industry all my life, it's great to hear someone that isn't mad because trees are being cut down. He makes a wonderful argument for using more wood. All this from a former radical activist who sat down and talked with people instead of being confrontational. Kudos to Mr. Moore.",1372118400,,367,4.841269841269841
