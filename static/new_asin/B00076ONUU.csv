2201011,3,B00076ONUU,"For the hard core car movie enthusiast this re-make will not satisfy.  The original is a classic genre film along the same line as ""White Line Fever"", ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", ""Duel"" ""Two Lane Blacktop"" and ""Sugarland Express"" to name a few.

However, viewed as a made for TV movie (which it was airing on Fox) it is reasonable entertainment.  The scene with the police officer using his own personal 68 Charger with a ""Starsky and Hutch"" light chasing our hero in his Hemi Challenger alone makes it worth watching.

2201013,4,B00076ONUU,"Viggo is such a good actor in this movie, but I don't like up in the air endings.",1120694400,2,81,3.5555555555555554
2201014,1,B00076ONUU,"Yeah, you guessed it... Another movie that makes you wonder if the writers in the movie industry have the worst case of writers block known to man. It seems that at least seven out of ten movies that have come out in the last ten years are poor remakes of classic movies that should have been left alone. It's bad enough that they can't write anything original, but then they go and massacre good movies someone else made... The only things this movie has in common with the original Vanishing Point are the desert, the Dodge, and the chase scenes. And that makes it a spinoff of the original, not a remake of it. Viggo Mortonsen is an excellent actor, but this is a C grade movie at best. The even ruined the scene with the lady biker...",1118793600,22,738,4.355072463768116
2201015,2,B00076ONUU,"They totally took out the whole core of what made the original movie tick. Barry Newman's Kowalski is an anti-hero of the first order- an ex-hero-cop who left the force because of all the dirty doings going on. He pops pills to stay awake to make his car deliveries. And he gets to be an icon of ""rebellion against the man"", even though he had no intention of doing so. In this movie, Viggo Mortenson's a family man just making car deliveries. His wife is pregnant and almost due, but he wants to make one last big delivery- of a super white Challenger. Course his wife has complications, and he's in a race to get back home to the hospital. He attracts the attention of local law enforcement due to his wild driving and speeding, and for some reason they decide to make an example of him. At one point one of the officers says, 'why don't we just let him go home, see his wife, and pick him up in a week?'. The same thought runs through the viewers mind, oh, right after the law finds out WHY he's off and running! And WORSE, they give this movie a happy ending!

The only redeeming feature is the car shots- especially the supercar shoot-out between the Challenger and a Charger. Which is why I gave it two stars

But this remake has cut all the soul out of the original movie. In the first movie, there's a touch of mysticism (there's a scene where Kowalski drives past himself in a car he just delivered going in the oppostite direction). There's a feeling of hopelessness in Kowalski that explains the ending better. And nobody will ever consider the remake to be a cult classic like the original is.

Ladies will enjoy all the shots of Viggo in this movie, I'm sure. And if Kowalski had been played by Jessica Alba I probably would've been kinder in my review. But as it stands, it's a pale imitation of the original.",1112486400,100,1823,4.387573964497041
2201016,4,B00076ONUU,"This is a fantastic film, especially if you enjoy car chasing scenes, burnouts and the like.  The old Challenger is supercharged in the story and is supposedly VERY fast.  Makes for some great action.  Highly recommended.  I will be buying this DVD.",1109808000,4,249,4.857142857142857
2201017,5,B00076ONUU,"I absolutely adore this movie, having caught it on late-late-late night television a while back. Fortunately, I had the foresight to tape it because I have watched it at least ten times since. I am so thrilled that they are finally releasing it on DVD! This Vanishing Point is a ""remake"" of the 1971 feature film by the same name. It stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role and Jason Priestly as ""the Voice"". I have never seen the original Vanishing Point but I understand that quite a few plot points have been changed in this made-for-TV version. Viggo Mortensen plays (excellently, of course!) Kowalski, a former Army Ranger/race car driver living in Idaho with his pregnant wife. He takes a job transporting a (gorgeous) Dodge Challenger across the country to earn enough money to pay for his wife to have her baby in the hospital. Unfortunately, his wife falls ill and Kowalksi must race against time to be by her side. Of course, the police and federal government are hot on his heels. This movie was made shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing and its views on the government may be a little surprising for a post-9/11 viewing audience. Some of the best parts of Vanishing Point come from the interactions Kowalski has with the various people he meets along his way. Guys, who may be bored with all the close-ups of Viggo Mortensen in a white t-shirt and tight blue jeans, will be pleasantly surprised to see Peta Wilson (of La Femme Nikita fame) speeding around on a motorcycle in a bikini midway through the film. See - there is something for everyone. I would highly recommend Vanishing Point as a fun, sweet, poignant, and interesting movie. Bonus: the swearing is almost non-existent and there is only one scene with a couple (a married couple) in bed and even then they are both covered up. My eleven-year-old niece can enjoy this movie with me, which makes it even more special. Buy it!",1109116800,28,1900,4.691616766467066
2201018,2,B00076ONUU,I think this was filmed before Viggo learned how to act.,1486598400,,56,4.181818181818182
2201019,5,B00076ONUU,"Way Cool! And I got it for an AFFORDABLE price! Buy it and share it with friends and fellow gearheads, as this is one of those movies that was once hard to get, and that didn't air on TV all too often! Don't forget, around 1997 or so, they did a modern TV special version of this movie....

Movie is interesting. YES, they did a limited edition Kowalski Challenger in white for the modern day Dodge Challengers. It is rare and not a factory car.... LOL

2201036,4,B00076ONUU,"In this made for TV 1997 remake of the 1971 original, we see Viggo Mortensen star as our main character, Jimmy Kowalski. Jimmy is a middle aged Gulf War veteran and former stock car racer, working as a delivery driver at a shop in Idaho. He agrees to deliver a 1971 Plymouth Roadrunner to New Mexico, to pay for his wife's, Raphinia, medical bills, who is on the verge of going into labor.

Immediately after, while doing another delivery en route to Salt Lake City, Utah, he receives word that his wife's pregnancy has fatally gone wrong, so he puts the pedal to the metal, in a rush back to Idaho and refuses to stop for the police who attempt to pull him over for speeding.  As if things weren't already bad enough, one of the cops falsely accuses Kowalski of being a domestic terrorist or drug runner and makes it his mission to stop Kowalski in his tracks. What follows is a film of hot pursuit with Jimmy Kowalski leading police on a chase over 1200 miles and 4 states away from his destination. Will Jimmy make it back home alive with the FBI breathing down his neck?",1466467200,,1074,4.391959798994975

The writer-director, Charles Robert Carner, is prominent in LA-based religious organizations such as Catholics in Media Associates and Holy Cross Family Ministries, and it shows. While the original film had its share of sixties hangover spiritual mysticism along with doobies and uppers, this remake is a stupid mess of over-the-top religious symbolism: crosses on the walls, crossing on the bodies, Kowalski's conversion, the plot markers--Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Easter. It has also been stripped of any offensive language and behavior. In place of the cult-awesomeness of the original is line after line of horrible writing, spoken horribly. I usually like Viggo a lot but he sleepwalks through this tripe. Keith David shows up for his paycheck, too, with an off-the-shelf government agent character. And Jason Priestley is no Cleavon Little. Very disappointing all the way around.

This more than deserves its place in the Top 10 movies that should never have been remade:

2201139,2,B00076ONUU,I saw this movie today and I thought what a thin plot. A guy just trying to get home to see his wife deliver. Kinda thin but hey I watched it anyway. The acting was so so but the best acting was by the radio guy Jason Priestly if that says anything. The car chases are really the only thing that keeps you interested in this movie if you're a Mopar fan. Still for the price they want for this movie I could find 5 other car chase movies that are all better.

They got it back and said it was fine and made me feel like i was trying to gyp them . I love this movie and want it really bad but if it won't play no sense in keeping it.

First of all, they completely changed the storyline by making ole Kowalski out to be some sort of domestic terrorist trying to get home to his pregnant wife.  If that wasn't bad enough, they totally screwed up the ole man in the desert (lots of beans) and put a bikini on the naked chick on the dirt bike.  The only good change was the addition of the Charger police car, though they could have made that part of the chase last longer.  Overall, it's worth a video rental.

2201162,4,B00076ONUU,"Remaking a film that was a cult classic from the 1970's is not an easy thing to do, and there are a million ways one could screw it up.  For all the things that could have gone wrong or angered fans of the original film, this one did okay.

Viggo Mortensen is Kowalski this time around, but this time he has more back-story and a wife waiting at home for him.  The whole plot gets tweaked a bit from the original since it changes the whole purpose of why he is trying to get cross-country in a specific amount of time.  Using a 1970 Dodge Challenger, Kowalski in the 1997 remake of a 1971 classic becomes much more of a cult hero with a heart rather than a cool guy who likes to drive fast.  Doesn't hurt it much, and Jason Priestley is the anti-government DJ who helps stir the fire when Kowalski starts to garner major attention to himself.  This film seems to be almost a vehicle of pop culture for the mid-nineties, with two of its major stars being popular from the series ""90210"" and many references done that spin the anti-government machine that was churning at the time, with many mentionings of Ruby Ridge, Waco, and Oklahoma City.

While the original film had its own raw mystique, this one doesn't do to bad despite giving more depth to the main character, which of course leads to more possibilities and unanswered questions.  Fasten a seatbelt if you have one, and watch how a man behind the wheel of a muscle car can become a folk hero, even if he never meant to!",1188086400,5,1478,4.368613138686132

2201164,5,B00076ONUU,"It has plenty of Mopar action in it. I could care less about the two goober stars of this, Viggo & Priestly, and i'm sure i'm not alone. I will buy this for 2 reasons; the Mopars and to a lesser extent, it has Steve Railsback(his groundbreaking role of Charles Manson in the original Helter Skelter from 1976). If it's possible for a newer movie to achieve cult status, this will be it. You'll be seeing these used on Amazon for $100 when production ceases. Pick it up NOW!",1175731200,3,473,4.325842696629214

I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the original, but geeze, it shouldn't be allowed to have the same name or main character. Totally different plot, totally corny. Was this made to be a chick flick? Someone mentioned what's his names blue eye's, and the woman in peril. If I remember he has to drive through Utah to Idaho and plays chicken with the cops. No cop is going to play chicken! Why doesn't he buy a freakin' plane ticket? Instead he tries to kill himself so his wife has nobody. Arrggh!",1172448000,5,676,4.2890625

Yeah, this movie version is definitely made for the ladies. Did you ever see such gorgeous blue eyes? They enhance the soul of the part Viggo plays. [Same with Hidalgo].

I love the souped up Hemi's - the muscle cars - but believe it, it takes a man to make the car.

And the gal who plays his wife has a certain beauty about her.

Believe me gals this is definitely a movie for the discerning female.  Ignore any comments made by you know whos.

Enjoy the gorgeous scenery, the speed, the swerves, the nasty David Keith, the Indian Reservation part, the Spirit, the Ending, the speculation.

Much more to my likeing than the original movie with its dark side.

2201177,1,B00076ONUU,"I just watched the original Vanishing Point again after having bought the DVD a few years ago.  I remember this flick from the mid-to-late 70's when I was a kid and too young to really get it.

Now it makes a lot of sense, after having lived another 30 years myself.  And then there's the downright unexplainable, but still cool... take the mystic link between Super Soul and Kowalski!  Somehow he knows when Kowalski is listening.  Something about his blindness gives him a kind of ""second sight"".  Freaky, but it works somehow.

To think that they could completely jack with that original concept!!  There will never be another time like the early 70's.  That great classic should just be allowed to rest unmolested.

I like the chick below who rated it one star simply because they sent her the wrong format.  She, too, hasn't seen it, but she realizes it deserves only one star!  I wish I could give it zero stars!  :-D",1149120000,6,923,4.588957055214724

2201179,3,B00076ONUU,"I only remember bits and pieces of the original Vanishing Point, it's been so long ago.  I recall enjoying the movie, though.  This remake is a modest piece with rather skimpy production values, choppy flow, and a cornball plot.  How many men do you know would steal a car (which is basically what Kowalski, the protagonist, does with the Hemi Challenger) and flee before cops of every stripe across a third of the country to make sure they were there for their wives' childbirths?

On the other hand, it was a hoot to see those magnificent Mopars ripping up the screen again.  Not to mention the put-downs of other makes (I paraphrase): ""Ha!, take that Chevy?  It takes a Mopar to catch a Mopar,"" says the cop as he very implausibly fires up his own Charger to put the collar on Kowalski.

There is in this movie a not too subtle zinging of overbearing, stifling law enforcement in America at all levels.  Only the county sheriff in the final blockade scene brings any kind of proportion to the whole matter while chewing out the feds.  Shades of sheriffs' power of old!  ""The Voice,"" which is the nickname for the radio jock who follows and praises Kowalski, is constantly ranting against big government before a background of pictures of Thomas Jefferson, New Hampshire's state motto ""Live Free or Die,"" and the like.  This character could have been played over the top in order to ridicule supposed Aryan rednecks, but wasn't.  Waco and Ruby Ridge reminders pop up now and then.

However, as if for balance, the desert encounter with a survivalist and his babe really was absurd.

Adjust your expectations and this movie makes adequate viewing, especially if you like big musclecars and a little anti-government rhetoric.  The ending is left open, with a little glow of warmth for those who want it.",1146614400,,1803,4.733974358974359

Kowalski had tried the straight and narrow and then the crooked and lowdown. He had failed (not always his fault and did have some successes...medal of honor ,e.g.)at each...had suffered the loss of his love,so, all that was left was death.
