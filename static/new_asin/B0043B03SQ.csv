8414527,5,B0043B03SQ,"First of all, Houston is my home town and I have this VHS tape with an original jacket that shows the actual subtitle, which is : ""How Houston Desegregated Its Public Accommodations  1959-1963"".  It is a documentary that originally aired on PBS stations in Texas and maybe other states.  The back of the original jacket reads:
*
""  Houston - the biggest city and home of the largest African-American community in the South - is often thought of as a place where nothing happened during the civil rights movement.  In fact, a great deal happened there.  ""The Strange Demise of Jim Crow"" is a unique and never before told tale, yet one emblematic of the quiet, almost stealthy way most cities in the South ultimately desegregated - the flip side of ""Eyes on the Prize"".
Told through the eyes of the participants, this remarkable documentary reveals the secret agreements and controversial news blackouts which accompanied the desegregation of lunch counters, hotels, restaurants, and theaters in Houston between 1959 and 1963.
""The Strange Demise of Jim Crow"" is a hopeful story of compromise and negotiation.  It is a cautionary tale about the complex trade-offs between press censorship and racial conflict.  ""
*
Part of what made the secret agreements and news blackouts possible was that, at that time,  the newspaper, tv stations, and radio stations were ALL locally, and privately/family owned.  They, and many other business owners, met with the local NAACP, and using guidelines sent to them by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  devised how they were going to desegregate Houston quietly......Houston  was home to all of them and NO ONE wanted to see the riots happening in Houston, so there was personal motivation on all sides to accomplish this.
Amazon should be putting this VHS tape on DVD and pairing the sale of the DVD with the book, ""No Color Is My Kind"".
This book is about Eldridge Stearns, who  was a very important part of the desegregation of Houston !
I wish I had thought of pairing that book with a DVD version of this VHS tape sooner, and maybe Amazon could have done this in time for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day this year....
Well, there's always next year...",1453075200,,2179,4.825268817204301
