4594451,4,B00578K2H6,"The author, whose entire family was killed by the Khmer Rouge regime, embarks on a quest for truth. He spends years locating perpetrators of the killings of one third of the Cambodian population during the years of 1975 and 1979. He wants no revenge, just the truth to come out. In a country where justice hasn't been made to the victims, Thet Sambath seeks to unveil the stories of those who participated in the murders of fellow citizens. He even establishes a personal relationship with Nuon Chea, the leader of the regime along with Pol Pot. For years Nuon Chea denies the claims made by Thet Sambath during their interviews, until he finally decides to admit the existence of the killings. The documentary also shows a teleconference meeting between perpetrators and victims in exile for the purpose of reconciliation.

It takes a very special person to be able to achieve this monumental work. I give four stars because I would like to see the many materials added as ""extra"" become part of the main documentary.",1361577600,5,1018,4.817142857142857

I were 15 years old, I have seen their killing of innocent peoples and others dies of starvation. All teenagers and young adults were separated from the parent and have to work very long hours for little or no food to eat. Every night, I went to sleep Hungary and drum only food to eat. This is a must see movie.

I applaud the author/director for his work.  A must see for anyone interested in genocide and a means of dealing with it.",1342051200,2,287,4.377358490566038
4594455,5,B00578K2H6,"Leaders around the world still are sorting out the aftermath of the vast crimes against humanity that swept through Cambodia in the 1970s. As recently as spring 2012, U.S. and Cambodian officials made front-page news by trying to reconcile the theft of a priceless Cambodian statue that apparently was stolen in the mid-1970s and wound up in a Sotheby's auction.

Even more important than sorting out reparations from cultural crimes in that era, the first of the Khmer Rouge war criminals was not convicted until 2010 and human-rights investigations continue in Cambodia to this day. Many investigators and journalists--like those you will meet in the historic video record in `Enemies of the People'--are still working to pierce the veil of secrecy about what happened during the bloody reign of Khmer Rouge terror. In that era, countless Cambodians who are alive today were brutally tortured--and 2 million Cambodians were murdered. (Some estimates place the death toll lower or higher.)

The fact that few perpetrators have been brought to justice is shocking. But, why should you care? Well, as a journalist myself, I've got a longtime commitment to spreading information that aids in global peacemaking. The release of collected video from the extensive `Enemies' filmmaking project, within this new DVD set, is exactly the kind of peacemaking effort we all can encourage.

When a version of the documentary aired in 2011 on PBS, I had a chance to interview the brave Cambodian journalist Thet Sambath. For years, he risked his life to find and interview Khmer Rouge killers. His body of work paved the way for the creation of this full-scale documentary film along with Rob Lemkin. Sambath has been a leading investigative journalist for a Cambodian English-language newspaper, the Phnom Penh Post. In 2011, he won the prestigious Knight International Journalism Award. The Sambath-Lemkin documentary, now, has racked up a whole shelf of additional awards and honors. Now, Sambath and Lemkin are working on a second film, as well. Your purchasing and spreading the news about their first project will help them in their ongoing efforts.

What are their motives? In our 2011 interview, Thet Sambath clearly explained why this film differs from many other movies about crimes against humanity. Truth be told, many movies focus more on the horrors, gore and suspense of such crimes throughout world history. The focus in `Enemies of the People' is squarely on reconciliation and peacemaking.

In 2011, Thet told me: ""We would like there to be people-to-people reconciliation between victims and perpetrators. There are thousands of Khmer Rouge perpetrators in Cambodia and abroad including the U.S. We want it to be possible they can all come forward and confess."" I asked, ""Why is that so important?"" He added, ""So the new generation can understand what happened and why. We must never repeat the mistakes of the past. We need to move forward to a brighter future.""

Finally, let me urge you: If you're intrigued by this film, buy it now. One of the unfortunate truths about today's media market is the fact that the delivery of movies to American viewers is changing dramatically right now. That means DVD sales in the U.S. are declining and many important DVD titles come and go--and potentially may vanish from the market without warning. I hope that Lemkin's and Sambath's supplement-stuffed DVD edition will continue to be on sale indefinitely. But my word of warning is: Get it now. This particular edition of the film includes lots of supplemental material that will help orient you to the Khmer Rouge era--and also to the aftermath for survivors of this massive crime against humanity. There's even a booklet in this current edition that is quite helpful to those who want to understand this tragic era--and the potential road ahead that we all may encourage in seeking peace.",1330473600,16,3889,5.0973312401883835
4594456,4,B00578K2H6,"We saw this movie early November 2011 in Phnom Penh during an archival study visit to Cambodia. Its focus differs from what many movies on the ""Cambodia Genocide"" tend to do, a peaceful people and the sudden appearance of some communist monsters destroying the fairy tale life in Cambodia. The focus is on the handwork of the killing, outside the now over-documented Tuol Sleng interrogation centre in Phnom Penh and the dark tourism park of The Killing Fields half an hour drive from the Cambodian capital. Unless the over-eager fast camera crews and filmmakers from the West that hastily try to cover the Cambodian drama in a few weeks, the Cambodian author of the movie spent ten years of effort in interviewing many people involved in the primitive killing machine, whereby the movie is just showing a few of the cases he has been able to document, explaining his almost casual way of engaging perpetrators into some sort of dialogue. This focus on the lower strata of killers is most important in a situation whereby the Cambodia International tribunal prosecutes the top layer of command only. The movie brings out that the over-repeated argument 'if I did not kill I would have been killed myself' is not the end of the story. A man interviewed and after several sessions confessing to some killings done, tries to minimise his involvement, he says he only killed a few. Another villager later comments on his statement telling that it had been many. Thet Sambath in one scene brings a villager to show how he did the actual killing offering himself for the reconstructive demonstration of throat slitting done with the same knife used to kill chickens. This is a harrowing scene whereby the killer villager refuses to act out this onto the interviewer and ends up - almost jokingly - to show his technique onto a member of his own family, the way to press down his knee on the back, lift the head and flash the knife.

This scene bring the fragility of any social structure into view, that once the constraints of an existing order with all its layers of what to do and what not, has been lifted, killing a fellow man may become an act as casual a butchering an animal for a daily meal. It has been noted by historians working on the Cambodian Genocide, that many of the killings were - seen from the top Red Khmer cadre, not intentional, but a mere outcome of  the social structures being destroyed. If this is so we are left with the haunting question about the intent of the International Tribunal and its limited Red Khmer top-cadre focus. A bottom up process of truth finding is needed as well before the Cambodians can cleanse their past and create a more stable society that will be able to withstand totalitarian policies.",1322092800,10,2738,4.702083333333333
4594457,5,B00578K2H6,"The Khmer Rouge's reign in Cambodia, has a notorious notch in history's timeline. But, unlike, say Nazi Germany, it is not as studied; the psychology of how neighbor turns against neighbor. This outrageous few years is not the stuff of museums and American history classes. Many do not even know what happened. Those who do still ask why.

Approximately one quarter of the population lost their lives; one quarter - that is not a misprint. Men, women and children. The Khmer Rouge regime murdered over a neighboring country's political movements, (Vietnam), and the paranoia that grew within two of Cambodia's leaders that ""infiltrators"" would take down their new communist regime.

After executing any high-level officials the two felt may be party resisters they took aim at farmers and workers. Villagers considered traitors (without trial or proof) were put to death.

Thet Sambath, who lost his father, mother and brother to the Khmer Rouge has become a journalist. And most recently, leaving behind his family, and safety, he has been working for years to gain the trust of a few still-living players in the ""Killing Fields,"" and the actual Second in Command's trust. Your stomach churns as Sambath smiles and documents confessions of their crimes in the late 1970s.

Though it has been decades since the killings there is still a country-wide silence about who did what and why. Sambath (along with co-director Rob Lemkin), weave through the agonizing footage of kindly-looking old men and women who once slaughtered their neighbors.

I can not think of any other mass-murder-in-history documentary that has captured (on film) the confessions of those directly involved. Some regretful, some filled with shame...others still standing by their decision that the deaths were to protect their country. The footage is remarkable. Sambath undertook the years of sacrificing and under cover friendships to document the crimes for future generations. He uncovers the truth as painful as it must have been for him personally.

This is an extremely important documentary. You will be moved to tears as a realization that so many died without reason starts to unfold. You realize, fear of being killed themselves, power over others, and ""orders"" from unverified sources lead to genocide.

After sweeping through film festivals, Enemies of the People"" is now available on DVD; which is great as you may need several stop-and-starts, the subject matter is so upsetting.",1321401600,14,2464,5.222784810126583
4594458,5,B00578K2H6,"The persistent reporter, with exceptional grace, lays bare the minds of some of the men who actually carried out the killings of Cambodia's ""Killing Fields"" as well as the mastermind, Pol Pot.  I've watched this documentary three times now on PBS and each time I've watched it start to finish without stepping away from the TV for the entire hour and a half, and each time with a deeper appreciation for the bloody, violent means that communism takes over and fundamentally changes a society. (Pol Pot actually uses the words ""fundamentally change"" when talking about his and his communist supporters goals for Cambodia. Where have we heard this kind of talk here in the U.S. recently?  Look to the White House.)",1318118400,5,712,4.87603305785124
4594459,5,B00578K2H6,"This is a brilliant, thoughtful study of a massively terrible event which is overwhelming in its scope.  Even now, the young people in Cambodia are forgetting about this time-partially because evidently some of the perpetrators are still in power.  It is never solved, truly-the whys of this tragedy.
  The narrator takes us though a journey with gentleness, graciousness-remarkable in the face of what he personally experienced.  Highly recommend this dvd...just watch it.",1310601600,17,473,5.513888888888889
4594460,5,B00578K2H6,"If you are looking for some insight into the minds of the Khmer Rouge leadership, this is as close as you will likely ever get, short of reading the party's Revolutionary Flag magazine, still not accessible to most readers. Not nearly as much of Nuon Chea as we would have hoped for, but significant admissions nonetheless. Mention of the purge of the Vietnamese and the Khmer Krom (translated as ""ethnic minority"" in the subtitles) is interesting, though strangely the ongoing tribunal seems not to be planning to try the leadership on genocide against the Vietnamese, only genocide against Cham Muslims. For those interested in reading party policy explicitly inciting crimes of genocide against the Vietnamese, the Revolutionary Flag, distributed to party members at the time, could hardly have been more clear on that subject. The recently released memoirs of Vietnamese foreign ministry officials reveal that China coerced the Vietnamese into ceasing to speak about genocide against the Vietnamese people in return for normalization of relations with China. So we need not expect any cooperation with the UN-funded tribunal in that regard.",1310428800,2,1144,5.3259668508287294
8460368,5,B00578K2H6,"The most striking thing of this film, is the indifference in the murder of another human being.  In each interview there is either denial of the act, or an indifference in the act itself.  Without a moral point of reference man is the most depraved.  These people are not some alien beings on another planet.  They represent what we might become ourselves.  Cambodians before the Khmer Rouge were know for honesty, grace, and fairness with one another.  Theft, murder, and even discourtesy were condemned.  It was the insanity of Communism, Marxism, and Atheism that brought about this change.  I recently saw the same indifference in interviews with Planned Parenthood over abortion, and I am not talking about politics.  You never want to wake up and say is that what I have become.",1495152000,,784,4.878787878787879
