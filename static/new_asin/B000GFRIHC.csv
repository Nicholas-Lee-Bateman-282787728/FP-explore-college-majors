4498581,4,B000GFRIHC,"So the girls are pretty hot that are ""modeling"" the swim suits but in HD you definitely see every little flaw the girls have (every wonder if models have any flaws in their skin you don't get to see on regular tv?). The swim suits appear to be very loose too and come off in almost every shoot. I got this because it was in HD and wanted to see how it stacked up against some of the similiar shows I get in HD off the satellite. If you are considering getting this just know that it true to its word being not rated as it probably would be rated NC-17!",1175644800,21,552,3.981981981981982
4498582,4,B000GFRIHC,"Some girls in bikinis, some not. A good amount of silicone also (approx 1/2 of the girls), but all very pretty models. This is not softcore, as some reviewers said. Nothing unsavory happens on this disc (if that's what you're looking for). Just some beautiful women posing on beaches, a dry lake bed, desert locales, etc. The hi-def format shows off the beauty of the scenery and the girls (and also shows off some skin imperfections too, due to the increased resolution).

Aria Giovanni is here. The third segment is uncredited, so it's hard to identify who the girls are. Samantha Martinez is in this for a brief minute or two. Magnolia Pictures seems to have disowned this disc, as it is nowhere to be found on their website.",1211587200,11,728,4.6434108527131785
4498583,1,B000GFRIHC,"Only two maybe three models worth watching.  The downside of high def shows here, flaws and surgical scars are abundant in this movie.  While some of the backdrops and locations really show blu rays potential most of the models show its downside.  I really would of thought that for this they would of picked other models that really would have made this one take off, hell I see plenty everyday here in Vegas that would have been better for this but if you don't mind acne and surgical scars or even botox and callogen overdoses then you might like this otherwise skip it and save your money.  Or at least get from netflix first to develope your own opinion.",1210291200,3,659,4.512605042016807
4498584,2,B000GFRIHC,"I owned this and sold it after watching it once. If you are curious and can buy or rent it very cheap then it may be worth looking into but that's about it. I do not think the average person will find the content itself, especially, to be something worth owning compared to other similiar material.

However, the picture quality (though possibly not transferred to disc in the most well-produced methods available) is quite stunning and the title is effective as a demo disc. If you just got into high-def and want to show your HDTV off to say, for example, some casual/jaded male friends then this will do the trick. Some of the scenes where the models are shot at night, dripping wet, with their reflections gleaming off the water are awesome as far as HD picture quality goes.

The content itself is weak though. Most of the scenes aren't that interesting at all, and only a few are - some of the later scenes in the desert are boring in an old Playboy video type way.

There is much, much better softcore content out there. Try bikiniriot.com to start or buy the hardcore blu-ray titles Babysitters or Dreamgirlz, for example, but avoid this if buying for content alone.",1210118400,19,1174,4.580952380952381
4498585,1,B000GFRIHC,i really don't see the point of buying substandard art. this is so watered down and trivial as to be non existent. find pirates or babysitters with jesse jayne and treat yourself to higher intellectual endeavours.,1207872000,4,213,4.944444444444445
4498586,5,B000GFRIHC,"This is an eye-popping high def production,yes sir the girls are realy sharp,and not just the camera focus,you get to see everything the Girls have to offer,not to mention the exotic locations,Boats Planes and luxurious Villas to boot. A first class Prodution with a nice pop-up menue,you can watch your favorite Girl and look for the next one at the same time,what more could a Man ask for? Maybe a second HD disc of the same quality and content of course,I would buy it without hesitation,this disc made the purchase of a blu-ray player worthwhile.",1193356800,,550,4.8
4498587,4,B000GFRIHC,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews so far.  Some of the lighting of the models is not the world's best.  Have if the models have even a slight flaw in their skin tone, one will see it on any LCD hi-def tv.  I played my disc on a PS3, and had no problems with the disc.

If you like exotic models in exotic locations, all in 1080i, buy this disc!",1187395200,,363,3.8
4498588,3,B000GFRIHC,"the video quality of this blu-ray disc is just good enough to make a seemingly flawless model look flawed indeed! although entertaining, this video does not contain any models worth paying to see. save your money.",1186444800,2,213,4.944444444444445
4498589,5,B000GFRIHC,nude models and exotic beachs! what else could you ask for. great buy if your like me a college study who loves your 52 inch samsung lcd and your ps3. not recommended for the family man.,1184976000,6,186,4.194444444444445
4498590,4,B000GFRIHC,"Would definitely be better if there was some close up shots and maybe a little penetration but hey, it's still new technology. You may want to save the cash if you have all the cable channels though, I've seen this series on one of the HD channels and was mad I bought it.",1184716800,,272,4.150943396226415
4498591,3,B000GFRIHC,"First off, I have to complain about the packaging of this Blu-Ray DVD; there are 3 security stickers, one on each opening edge of the DVD case. I struggled trying to get these off and it took literally about 10 minutes because they came off in pieces. There is excessive. I've purchased other Blu-Ray and HD-DVD (as well as standard DVD) titles that only had one security sticker on there, which is enough.

In terms of the content of this DVD, they could have done a bit better. I've read some reviews complaining about the caliber of the models. I don't really have a complaint here-the models on this program and plenty sexy and beautiful to me, even though they are not necessarily 'super model' material. They all seem fun and nice-I'd certainly welcome getting to know any of them.

I'm a pro photographer and was a little disappointed with the lighting in most of the scenes. They shot in bright afternoon daylight and this lighting is really not ideal to showcase models or scenery. There's a good reason why Sports Illustrated swimsuit photo shoots are all done in either the very early morning sunrise or at dusk, but never any time in between. This lack of good luscious rich lighting yields a slightly amateurish feel to this DVD, although they did the best with what they had I suppose.

The picture quality is excellent and will really showcase your HDTV setup well. That said, it can also expose any flaws in the model's complexion. To me this is a good thing because it's more real-I would certainly not choose to have it be more blurry or anything.

For anyone wondering, the models are completely nude. This is not just another Bikini Destination video where the models are in bikinis so watch out.",1175644800,33,1716,4.653465346534653
8447825,3,B000GFRIHC,"No surprises here: three half-hour segments featuring a bevy of female models, some from Bikini Destinations on HDNet, wearing little to nothing in High Definition.  This isn't the same material as found on the ""Fantasy"" unrated HD release from HDNet, and doesn't feature some of the models found on the cover art.  The HD-DVD obviously isn't appropriate for every audience, and some of the models have unfortunate enhancement scars that don't translate very well to 1080i detail.  But if a Sunday halftime show sucks and you want to show off 1080i content to your buddies, this does its job just fine.  Video is flawless; audio is dialogue and unremarkable.",1287273600,,658,5.009174311926605
8447826,2,B000GFRIHC,"If you're a Laura Davis fan then don't buy this disc, she's only on the cover.",1286323200,,78,3.9375
8447827,5,B000GFRIHC,"This Blu-ray is as the subject reads, worth every penny! This video contains full frontal nudity of the hottest girls in high definition. I bought this video without knowing anything about it or relying on the reviews & it was completely worth it. I was surprised at the quality of the girls in this video & the full frontal exposure. You get to see everything in this three part bikini destination project. The video is setup as if it were aired on pay per view. Cut up into segements, it features several girls who individually narrate their own experiences in modeling, traveling, their likes & dislikes, and their favorite assets all the while going from tini bikinis to completely naked on the exotic beaches & pool side resorts all over the world. I was expecting to see mostly girls posing in their bikinis with brief glimpses of their finest parts unrated but trust me in that you see the girls naked more so than in their bikinis. 100% grade A t&a! I've ""enjoyed"" this video over and over again and with the number of girls featured it's impossible for it to get old. I highly recommend this video to anyone looking to have a good time with hot and sexy girls with rocking voluptuous bikini bods.",1286236800,2,1205,4.583333333333333
8447828,2,B000GFRIHC,actually not as good as it ought to have been .. watched it once ...,1260576000,,68,3.6
8447829,2,B000GFRIHC,"This is the kind of thing that you may find exciting if you are a 14 year old boy.  No offense, I was there once too and probably would have ""viewed"" this several times.  But, for anyone past high school age you're probably going to find the models lacking in the looks department.  It's kind of like one of those bad Playboy videos where they just get topless and prance around on some set.  Nice at first but gets old very quickly.  One of the models is even a p*rn star.  Kind of makes you wonder why they insisted on keeping the bottoms on.  Might have been better if they had gone full nude.",1241827200,,596,4.175438596491228
8447830,5,B000GFRIHC,"I FOUND THE PRODUCT TO BE AS ADVERTISED. IT WAS BRAND NEW.  THE COLOR AND
DETAIL WAS OUTSTANDING.  I GIVE IT 5 OUT OF 5 STARS.",1241308800,,126,3.8076923076923075
8447831,3,B000GFRIHC,"Essentially 3 different 30 minute long videos.

The first two have a high production value and choose great locations to shoot. It looks like something that could be on E! or something (boobs blurred out, of course). Most of the girls leave something to be desired, and a couple are more fake than press on nails. A couple more have no apparent idea how to work the camera. The hi-def cameras weren't always that flattering either. Listening to the girls talk is horrible as most of them are void of anything intelligent to say.

Still a couple of them, like Brooke Adams (a Hawaiian Tropic model) and Jessica Barton (former FHM model) were awesome. Not by chance, these two also had very similar shoots, both of them rolling around topless in wet sand. That looked really good in 1080p.

The third video has a very low-end production value and pretty much looks maybe a step above a porno. Again, some girls were pretty shoddy. Still, the few really hot girls are more than worth your time. Plus, if you're a fan of wet shirts and mesh and stuff, this final video delivers its fair share. Unlike the first two, this one also has full frontal nudity.

All-in-all, this Blu-Ray is not worth buying. If you buy it, you'll probably find yourself skipping alot of scenes. Not a purchase you'll be proud of, more like rental material.",1240185600,,1329,4.61864406779661
8447832,4,B000GFRIHC,"Now Don't ask how I got it and know I would not normally buy this myself. It's not up to the same quality as a sports illustrated swimsuit edition production wise and is nothing more than eye candy presented in HD. 1080I and is the first ( I think ) of the genre in hd. Think of it as playboy wannabe in video. Now if there was a little less racy more scenery version it would make great demo material, the video quality is very good and better than most supposed demo bluray stuff. Only 2.0 audio but nothing in it really needs 5.1 anyhow. The irony is after seeing this one wants to see if they can find an SI edition in bluray.

I'm giving it a 4 rating for being first, and setting a standard for the rest to follow, hopefully a bit more effort put into production and maybe some worthy extras like behind the scenes of how it's made etc ( note I am a photographer so wanting to know how to shoot this is more important than the material encased ). Would I add another to my collection? If it they put some refinement into it and put more effort into making it look less like a wanna be production and developed a genuine style of their own.

Now where is the SI bluray.",1238371200,,1174,4.122270742358078
8447833,5,B000GFRIHC,"The quality of the picture is REAL HD .....The places are truely exotic and the colours are just magnificent.....My only OBJECTION is with the MODELS.....There are only 4-5 supermodels.....(First 10-15 minutes) The rest are just USUAL ones with nothing exotic on them.....as if they were put in the film just to fill up the rest of the film's duration!
Nevertheless , i LOVE the movie!!!!!!",1219536000,2,390,5.015384615384615
