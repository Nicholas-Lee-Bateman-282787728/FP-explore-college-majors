8245806,5,B0012FVZ60,"Our boys keep asking if there is going to be another Geotrax train DVD.  Not all the trains we have are in this DVD.  Are they going to do another DVD?  Finding Geotrax trains is getting harder and harder, unless you want to go on EBay and keep bidding.  Do they plan to stop manufacturing Geotrax trains?  Would love to know!",1394150400,,326,4.278688524590164
8245807,4,B0012FVZ60,My grandchildren love the dvd. I did have the original dvd from GeoTrax and it was lost. This dvd doesn't have all the 5 original episodes - that disappointed me.,1361750400,,162,4.433333333333334
8245808,5,B0012FVZ60,"My sons love Thomas, but this has become their second new favorite.  Two great little 11 minute movies with a third bonus movie.  I don't mind watching it either.  My son loves the ""ghost train"" and talked about it for weeks!  Great movie, especially for the price!",1318550400,,265,4.574468085106383
8245809,1,B0012FVZ60,"The video I received was given an 'excellent' rating, it was horrible, it skipped and paused the whole way through.  My son who was so excited for it was very sad!",1315612800,,163,4.258064516129032
8245810,2,B0012FVZ60,"I THINK this is the dvd that came with our Geo Trax train set. It's the only dvd I could find sold separately to write a review for. If this is the dvd that comes with the train sets, here goes: The heroes are all square-jawed WASPy white guys. And those are the ONLY appealing characters. If you and your child belong to any other ethnic or geographic group or physical type, be aware there are some offensive stereotypes. There was such a huge lack of imagination in writing these characters. The comedy relief is a freckled, unintelligent kid with a thick Southern/Appalachian accent and underbite who is always doing stupid things, which Southerners will just love (not). And then to offend Latinos, there's a stunt pilot with a thick Mexican accent who keeps shouting ""that loco!"" etc and is cowardly and has to be talked into doing the right thing by the heroic, square-jawed white pilot. There's the pair of guys on the maintenance crew, one black, one fat, who are drawn as really ugly with weird teeth. There's a balding, fey, English man. Because apparently in these writers' view, all English men are gay. The villain is Russian with a thick accent and big mustache. Seriously? Are the writers aware the Cold War is over? Like decades ago? My son enjoys watching the video but he's only 2 and I think not absorbing much of it. I'm throwing it out by the time he does absorb any of these insulting (and worse, uninteresting) portrayals.",1303603200,2,1446,4.65234375
8245811,5,B0012FVZ60,"My grandson was sooo excited to get the Team Geo Trax Episodes.  They arrived so quickly after I ordered them!  We had ordered them when Fisher Price was offering them for free on their website, but they never came!  It was worth paying the minimal charge and receiving them so quickly from you!  Thanks!  GEO TRAX.........All Aboard!!!",1297296000,,336,4.824561403508772
8245812,5,B0012FVZ60,"My oldest son got his first set of GeoTrax with it came the DVD with 2 episodes. As he got more he accumulated more DVDs the latest has 3 episodes. Go to Geotrax website and stream all 4 episodes (FREE). Each episode teaches your child about team work,  which is more important than ever in this day and time.",1248825600,2,309,4.237288135593221
8245813,5,B0012FVZ60,I actually logged onto amazon to see if I could find more episodes to order.  My son received the dvd free with his kid tough dvd player.  He watches the episodes over and over.  I honestly don't see what's so intriguing about the show but it keeps his attention.,1231804800,,263,4.326530612244898
8245814,5,B0012FVZ60,My 2 1/2 year old son loves the Geotrax episodes. He watches them over and over and never tires of them. He has also asked for the Geotrax items for Christmas. The episodes are short and easy to understand/follow.,1224460800,2,213,4.487179487179487
8245815,5,B0012FVZ60,"My son loves watching these videos.  There are three of them, wish there were more, but you do get these free if you purchase certain GeoTrax items.  I bought the DVD from Amazon marketplace.",1216339200,,191,4.588235294117647
