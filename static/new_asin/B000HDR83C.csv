8385892,5,B000HDR83C,"Grew up during this story, in Canada. Was about the same age as Terry. It was a time that pulled the entire nation together. What an amazing story to live and to watch again.  His foundation is amazing.  Also when I moved across Canada I remember seeing the Terry Fox memorial near Thunder Bay Ontario on the Trans Canada Highway #1.  Amazing young man.",1489622400,,353,4.484375
