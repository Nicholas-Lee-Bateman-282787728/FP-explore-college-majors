846631,5,6304341733,Great movie. Decent.  We enjoyed this movie tremendously and plan to let our grandchildren watch it.,1266451200,,100,5.25
846632,2,6304341733,"Limp effort to present one of James Fennimore Cooper's Leather Stocking Tales. It has none of the pacing, drama, realism or tension of another of Cooper's tales on film, ""Last of the Mohicans"", with Daniel Day Lewis. The music alone sets ""Mohicans"" apart. Don't bother with this film.",1265155200,2,284,4.9375
846633,3,6304341733,I thought this was an excellent movie.  Held my attention well. I would recommend it for anyone interested in this period of history of our country.,1252713600,2,148,4.6923076923076925
846634,1,6304341733,If I could get my money back I would....If not for Graham Greene and Russell Means lol..One of the worst films I have seen in a long time! Was so boring it actually put me to sleep!,1231113600,8,181,3.918918918918919
846635,2,6304341733,"On the box of the VHS version of this film (at least on the edition that I bought) is a subtle clue that this film is not only pretty far from the original James Fenimore Cooper novel but also that this film was meant to cash in on the popularity of the 1992 film of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Another subtle clue that this film is not everything it's supposed to be is the fact that this is a Hallmark film, which means that any violence and/or sexual content will be strictly PG.

Having gotten that out of the way, let me proceed to the other flaws of this film. As stated above, this direct-to-video tries to use some of the dramatic devices that made the 1992 LAST OF THE MOHICANS film so good, namely that in this version of THE PATHFINDER the title character (played by Kevin Dillon) is again the adopted son of Chingachgook (played stoically by Graham Greene). All dialogue in this film is in English, whether spoken by Native Americans, English or even French (and speaking of French, Stacy Keach is abhominably miscast as French General Comte du Leon with the worst make-up job I have ever seen even for a French caricature!) Kevin Dillon as the ""Hawkeye"" character (now known as ""Pathfinder"") tries to play him like a younger version of Daniel Day-Lewis and doesn't quite get it. Graham Greene, as stated before, is very stoic as the Last of the Mohicans (no mention is made in this film of his dead son Uncas, the events of LAST OF THE MOHICANS or even that Uncas ever existed), but one gets the feeling that the part might have been played even better if Russell Means (who just barely appears in the very minor and miswritten role of the Tuscarosan Indian Arrowhead) had been allowed to reprise his role as ""Chingachgook"" from the 1992 film. The villain of the story, the one-eyed Lieutenant Zale (played by Charles Charles Powell), shows his sliminess too soon and is too quickly recognized as the villain. The secondary ""hero"" of the story, Ensign Jasper Weston (Jaimz Woolvett) is likeable enough, but doesn't really arouse any sympathy from the viewer or dislike even though he is Pathfinder's romantic rival for the beautiful Mabel Dunham. Laurie Holden as Miss Dunham is pretty and more likeable than the Mabel of the book, but unfortunately her character pales besides Madeleine Stowe's 1992 ""Cora Munro"" (to be honest, any other heroine from a Cooper novel would!)

This film also (unfortunately) tells the story in the form of a flashback, with a grandmother and her grandchildren celebrating July 4th, 1800 and her telling the story to them as a bedtime story (I leave it to you, the reader, to guess the reason for this framing or the cliche that comes at the end of the film). This is not the first time that a J. F. Cooper adaptation film has used this device (another example is the 1977 TV version of LAST OF THE MOHICANS starring Steve Forrest of the TV series ""S.W.A.T.""-fame as ""Hawkeye), and to be totally honest it works no better here. The direction by Donald Shebib and script by Tommy Lynch and Bruce Reisman are pretty lackluster and never totally engage the viewer.

All in all, if you want to complete your collection of films adapted from james Fenimore Cooper novels, this film will do ... at least until the BBC release their 1973 five-episode TV serial of HAWKEYE, THE PATHFINDER starring John Abineri as Chingachgook and Paul Massie as Pathfinder. After all, if the BBC could finally release their 1971 8-part version of LAST OF THE MOHICANS (the finest adaptation ever made and thought to be lost), anything is possible!",1176249600,29,3565,4.664546899841017
846636,2,6304341733,"This adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's book is, in a word, HORRIBLE! While I've read Cooper's ""The Last of the Mohicans"", I've never read this particular story, and this movie did not encourage me to read it.  The dialogue was juvenile; the acting was atrocious (what made these normally good actors take on this project is bewildering).  I'm only giving two stars because I felt sorry for the actors to have to endure this project, otherwise it would've been one (or minus one).",1154563200,18,483,4.807228915662651
846637,3,6304341733,"The review by quiet traveller is NOT of this movie, it's of a movie called Ofelas, translated as Pathfinder in its US release. This movie is based on a James Fenimore Cooper story about the Americas during the French and Indian wars. (Ignore the star rating, because I haven't actually watched this movie yet. I ordered it thinking it was Ofelas - which, it turns out, isn't available on DVD, at least not in the US.)",1146096000,4,417,4.5
846638,2,6304341733,"The Pathfinder is the third in plot succession of James Fenimore Cooper's Leather-Stocking Tales, a series of five novels depicting life along early America's northeast frontier, each of which features adventures engaging Natty Bumppo, called Leather Stocking due to his long deerskin gaiters, and are full of exciting occurrences, the author's love of the native forests, and scenes ripe for performing artists' insights. We should expect to be grateful for this adaptation, with its more than adequate funding, an outstanding director and technician, Donald Shebib, and proven cast members including Graham Greene, Stephen Russell, Stacy Keach, and Laurie Holden, but the work's very opening scene, depicting the oftseen Flabby Bodied Non-Indians Stripped To The Waist, Daubed In War Paint, And Jiggling Their Soft Bellies Through The Woods, is a harbinger of the sloppy production values to come. The cardinal problem here involves wholesale changes in the plot of the novel, apparently scripted by committee, which includes unrequited love and its effects, altered drastically among the roles, with other sharp alterations bringing about losses of logic, suspense and dramatic continuity, shabby stunt direction and ragged editing also adding to the visual disharmony. Some of the players are quite effective in this beautifully costumed production, actually filmed on and about the Lake Ontario locations of the novel, especially Keach as a French general, Greene as Bumppo's Mohican mentor, Holden with a typically sincere performance, and excellent stage-trained Canadian Russell as the principal villain; however, the remainder of the casting is quaint at best, remarkably so in the case of the film's lead, Kevin Dillon, far too young and lacking in range for the fortyish Pathfinder, who gives one the perception throughout that showing up for this one was the most unpleasant thing that he had been forced to do for a while.",1122076800,3,1935,5.453333333333333
846639,3,6304341733,"This is a made-for-cable movie adaptation of the James Fennimore Cooper classic ""The Pathfinder"", the last in his famous Leatherstocking Tales, and billed essentially as the sequel to ""Last of the Mohicans"". This version stars Kevin Dillon as Pathfinder (aka Hawkeye, Deerslayer, Natty Bumppo, etc.) and Graham Greene as his adoptive Mohican father Chingachgook. Together they must help defend a remote British outpost on the western frontier from attack during the early years of the French and Indian War.  In doing so, Pathfinder once again must choose between his duty to his friends and father and the woman he falls for.  Only this time the French and Indians are being aided by a traitor within their midst and it is up to our heroes to find and stop him before he can betray the fort to it's deadly enemies.  This is a decent stab at a film version of this classic book and I am glad I bought the video.  However, it is a far cry from it's predecessor LOTM and it's big-budget production values.  It is definately worth a look though for anyone interested in this historic period and defiantely for those who loved Last of the Mohicans.",1015718400,13,1144,4.728643216080402

846846,1,6304341733,"Not what I expected. But as the saying goes, we're all intitled to our own opinions. It focused on the young actresse so much we couldn't see the movie for the actresse. Sorry I purchased it",1391126400,,190,4.305555555555555

846957,3,6304341733,Quite an interesting western and one that would not feel out of place in anyone's collection. Perhaps it's a little different from the run-of -the-mill type that you tend to find!,1385424000,,179,4.806451612903226
846958,1,6304341733,"The movie is a waste of time.  In 1800 A grandmother is telling the story of the Pathfinder to her grandchildren and the story is seen in a series of flashbacks.  At one point one of the children says ""yuck"" a word first used in 1966.  Similar anachronistic annoyances are found throughout the movie.  It's a complete mess and I never thought I'd say that about a movie with the fine actor Graham Greene in it.  It's devoid of interest and not entertaining in the least.  0 stars.",1382400000,,480,4.3977272727272725

846963,3,6304341733,"Both of these videos were OK.  I wouldn't watch them again.

I had a hard time watching Hiawatha.  The Hiawatha character did not look American Indian, which took away from the story's authenticity.

Pathfinder was nothing special.",1364083200,,231,5.162162162162162

The acting was very amateurish; the action scenes were awkward and not believable; the horrible wigs and makeup of some of the actors especially the French general; and what's up with the flies as her father lay on his death bed?
