4686962,5,B005G172Y0,"Got a taste for BBC comedy or drama? Perhaps you're hooked on the quirky personalities who work in the Ladies' and Men's departments at the Grace Brothers department store in London? Sure, that series ended its 13-year run in 1985 and some of the comic bits are slightly dated--but many Americans love the reruns of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Being-Served/dp/B002I9TZHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Being Served?</a>&nbsp;Or, how about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballykissangel/dp/B004EYT8EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballykissangel</a>, set in a quirky little town in Northern Ireland, where everyone from the priest to the pub owner is likely to get tangled up in an hour-long farce?

We could go on and on with this quirky list. In our family, we're big Lark Rise and Ballykissangel fans. And, even though we've seen those Christmas episodes, we enjoy the holiday mood so much that we're happy to see these favorites again. When we broke open this set, we had friends visiting who were big fans of Good Neighbors. They had seen the particular Christmas episode in this set multiple times, but it was their choice for all of us to enjoy together. And, now, our family has a taste for Good Neighbors. (Especially after we recognized the starring actress in that series as Rosemary from our own favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-Thyme/dp/B005DVIPY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary & Thyme</a>

You get the idea. Folks who have a taste for this stuff can't get enough of it. And a wonderful, multi-title sampler like this lets us all taste series we haven't watched before. How about: Black Adder? Lovejoy? All Creatures Great and Small? They're all in this set. Even the irreverent Vicar of Dibley shows up in this more-than-10-hour, 4-DVD collection of holiday episodes from 13 BBC comedies and dramas. We've had a ball with this holiday set, enjoying our own favorites and discovering series we haven't yet explored. We're sure that a copy of the BBC Holiday Comedy and Drama Gift Set will light up the holidays for someone you love.",1322438400,27,2660,6.128686327077748

Although I have most of the sit-coms already, I'm still looking forward to owning this! As a collector of Christmas DVDs it's great to see them all in one package. My favourite has to the Good Neighbours episode. The biggest draw for me though are the dramas, known as light entertainment in the UK. Most of them aired on Sunday nights and were extremely popular. I can't wait to see the All Creatures Great and Small episode,

Although much discussion could be had about what's missing, this is a very comprehensive selection. Despite some programmes having the same writers they are all very different from each other. This would make a perfect present for any Brits living in the US, fans of British television and collectors of all things Christmas! This is a quality collection and will sit happily side by side with the American equivalents&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Sets-Holiday-2-Pack/dp/B0040PEZWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Sets: Holiday 2-Pack</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merry-Sitcom-Christmas-Classics-from-TV-s-Golden-Age/dp/B002JYPVS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merry Sitcom!

Last Of The Summer Wine ... Keeping Up Appearances ... etc.  My wife and I both have some time off work the week after Christmas this year, so we're planning to sit down one day while we're off work and watch as many of these as we want to ... and I can hardly wait!!

4686980,5,B005G172Y0,"What an improvement over regular Public Broadcast Station transmission of these same programs!!  First of all, picture and audio quality on all the episodes is really good, especially considering they are not Blu-Ray, and subtitling on all selections is clear as a bell.  Of course, viewing them using a Blu-ray DVD player enhances video quality, but even on a regular DVD player, these discs are very good.

Also, this compilation (BBC Holiday Comedy & Drama Gift Set) is a much better value than purchasing just the 2-disc BBC Holiday Comedy set, which has only eight episodes (one each from ""'Allo 'Allo,"" ""Are You Being Served,"" ""Black Adder,"" ""Good Neighbors,"" ""Keeping Up Appearances,"" ""Last of the Summer Wine,"" ""To the Manor Born,"" and ""The Vicar of Dibley"").  The BBC Holiday Comedy & Drama Gift Set, on the other hand, has four discs, including the eight comedy episodes (each ranging from approximately 35 to 45-minutes long) PLUS five drama episodes (each about one-hour long) from ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" ""Ballykissangel,"" ""Lark Rise to Candleford,"" ""Lovejoy,"" and ""Monarch of the Glen,"" for a grand total of nearly 10 and 1/2 hours of genuinely heart-warming holiday viewing pleasure!!

If you are a fan of BBC comedy and drama, treat yourself to this lovely compilation!!  I was fortunate enough to grab it when it was priced at about $10, but I believe you can still get it for as little as $12 on Amazon, at least as of the date of this review.",1418515200,5,1470,4.883534136546185

4687004,5,B005G172Y0,"This is the way to buy the 2011 BBC Holiday delight. They have all the chosen episodes from great series on two other Holiday sets, one for drama, one for comedy, but this is the most economical way to purchase it all. And it's worth owning it all. What a delightful way to get a look at the series, if you are not familiar with them. This represents some of the best BBC television every produced. My favorites from these selections are Lark Rise to Candleford, Monarch of the Glen, To the Manor Born, and Are You Being Served--probably in that order. All of those series were over-the-top of 5-star series. But you can't discount any of these fun holiday happenings. Some of the BBC series lasted for many years and thus there were multiple holiday episodes. It takes owning the entire series to get them all, unless BBC begins putting out a new set of Holiday Delight every year. Put THAT on your Santa list.

The other sets include one with 5 BBC dramas and their holiday episodes from All Creatures Great and Small, Ballykissangel, Monarch of the Glen, Lovejoy, and Lark Rise to Candleford; the set called ""BBC Holiday Drama"", of course. Then, ""BBC Holiday Comedy"" contains 8 funny BBC Christmas specials from The (plump female) Vicar of Dibley and their holiday pageant to Good Neighbors when Yule joy goes so wrong. Between are seasonal shows from Are You Being Served, To the Manor Born, Allo Allo, Last of the Summer Wine, Keeping Up Appearances, & Blackadder.

Warning: If you are new to BBC and British comedy and drama, this set will get you hooked.
Bottom line, I recommend both the BBC Holiday Drama, and BBC Holiday Comedy, but the true value is BBC Holiday Gift Set--the full meal deal, all 13 in one set, at the lower price.

Then...there's more...you must see ""Creature Comforts-Merry Christmas Everybody"" Get it used or new. We bought several over the years as gifts. We watch our own copy many times every Christmas. It is a hilarious quirky look at the song ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" that you will never forget. Yep, it's British.
