3775520,4,B001RFEJIQ,"Documentary about a wagon train in the Mountain Meadow area of Utah. The party were killed by the settlers of a nearby town. All were shot except for a few children.

There have been several monuments to the fallen in this area and this film includes the controversy over the monuments and the events after the killings.

To me this was always a footnote in history. I have found limited information about the topic. Now I can see more of the story. This story is told in an even manner. There are still many living relatives of the slain party. There story is included.",1296086400,4,570,4.471153846153846
3775521,5,B001RFEJIQ,"In history, murder or war, religion has played a sad part. Those religions who commit the crime seek to cover up, alter, minimize or deny their culpability. Judaism, Isalm, and Catholicism has a chapter. On September 11th 1857, in Utah, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wrote their chapter with the blood of the Fancher-Baker party as they travelled through from Arkansas to California. This well researched, moving documentary explains the massacre in Mountain Meadows and how 142 years later the decendents on both side struggle over the monument and how history of this event should be remembered. This is not a film set to portray The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a negative light. It is simply to present their role in history.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mountain-Meadows-Massacre/dp/0806123184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mountain Meadows Massacre</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-of-the-Prophets-Brigham-Young-and-the-Massacre-at-Mountain-Meadows/dp/0806136391/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-for-the-Bible/dp/B000PSJBGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle for the Bible</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-s-Mysteries-The-Inquisition-History-Channel/dp/B000AABKYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History's Mysteries - The Inquisition (History Channel)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Files-of-the-Inquisition/dp/B000P7V6UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Files of the Inquisition</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Bible-Matthew-Acts/dp/B000V72AZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Bible: Matthew & Acts</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fox-s-Book-of-Martyrs/dp/1153769956/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fox's Book of Martyrs</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Graham-Presents-The-Hiding-Place/dp/B000BOH8VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Graham Presents: The Hiding Place</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Counterfeit-Gospel-of-Mormonism-The-Great-Divide-Between-Mormonism-and-Christianity/dp/1565078454/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Changing-World-of-Mormonism-A-Behind-the-Scenes-Look-at-Changes-in-Mormon-Doctrine-and-Practice/dp/0802412343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Changing World of Mormonism: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Changes in Mormon Doctrine and Practice</a>",1294704000,2,2888,11.955156950672645
3775522,5,B001RFEJIQ,"This documentary is a matter-of-fact telling of how the descendants of both the victims, survivors, and perpetrators make peace.

If you want to find out the telling of the actual incident, then you need to see History Channel's ""Investigating History: Mountain Massacre"" DVD.

The problem is that the Mormon (LDS) church Prez. won't take responsibility or admit guilt for the massacre even though the murderers were all Mormons.  (You see this said by the families of the survivors in the DVD.  The LDS's lawyers are afraid to open the church up to lawsuits.

The real solution, of course, is for the descendants of the murderers to apologize to the descendants of the victims and survivors.

Then true healing can begin.",1265328000,6,722,4.975
3775523,5,B001RFEJIQ,"I've read, listened to lectures about, watched documentary after documentary and studied the Mountain Meadows Massacre from just about every source imaginable.  I've even suffering through the engaging but woefully inaccurate Hollywood movie, ""September Dawn"" (Bill McKeever and Aaron Shafovaloff's analysis of everything that's wrong with that film is excellent.

That's why I can say with some degree of authority that this documentary is the most thorough, thoughtful, and historically accurate short summary of the Massacre and it's fall out that I have found to date.

I would recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in the Massacre whether it's an event that you're new to or long studied in.

I would also recommend this documentary to anyone who has ever wondered, ""What happened AFTER the Massacre?"" this documentary answers that question as well.

And as a note to fellow Mormon Studies Scholars I feel obligated to mention that this documentary contains what appears to be the only surviving record of the infamous Gordon B. Hinckley September 11, 1999 Dedication Speech at the new Mountain Meadows Massacre Memorial site in which he stated explicitly, ""They [the Massacre Victims] did nothing wrong"".  The inclusion of this rare and extraordinary speech - alone -  makes this documentary worth the price of admission!",1240358400,13,1344,5.341232227488152
8337881,5,B001RFEJIQ,"OUTSTANDING documentary! The best detailed account of the horrors and aftermath of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. Very well researched and documented. Without admitting guilt or involvement, the Mormons have assisted the descendants of the tragedy with the building of memorials in addition to maintaining the site, which is a step in the right direction. I doubt the church will ever admit to any wrongdoing, in spite of the fact that the blood of the victims are all over their warped religious ideology and delusional leadership. While difficult and challenging, it is good to see that descendants from both sides have reached out to one another in forgiveness and apology. Perhaps the Mormon Church can learn from them and issue a formal apology and responsibility for their part in this horrible event? We'll see.......",1493856000,2,824,5.203007518796992

8337885,5,B001RFEJIQ,Tells it like it is.  If you are LDS you should watch this but you probably will be afraid to.  Please don't be.  It tells of a horrible event in a fair and sensitive way and how ancestors on both sides are working together to bring about truth that the church has hidden and  much needed changes it has stood in the way of.,1453161600,,324,4.015625

8337887,5,B001RFEJIQ,"I would highly recommend this documentary.  It contains information about a very important part of American history that is little known. It also happened on Sept 11th, but in 1857.  Having just learned recently that my family was one of the leaders of the massacred wagon train, it made the film that much more insightful.
It looks at the massacre from both the victims and the perpetrators perspective.",1446854400,,404,4.926470588235294

The film maker did an outstanding job of story telling. The only problem as I see it,  the vast majority of folks who would undoubtably enjoy seeing the film will never get the chance, because of distribution problems  and piracy of copy written material.
Documentary film makers work so hard assembling the small Army of dedicated craftsmen that is needed to concoct a project  of  this sort   I for one appreciate  great story telling of American Crime History and this little film is a home run... Everyone I lend the DVD to is fascinated ... They also want to know why in the HELLo it was omitted from being taught in High School or Jr High.",1415923200,2,905,4.571428571428571
