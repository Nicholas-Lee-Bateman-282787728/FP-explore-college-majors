8353191,5,B0026MS3OK,"I was a little intimidated by the thought of doing MMA workouts, but they were totally doable. The intensity was high, but you can do anything for five minutes. I also really liked being about to see the ""guinea pigs"" trying out the workouts and watching their own transformations.

I will definitely be adding this workout to my repertoire.

Looking forward to the next one.",1259366400,,375,4.753846153846154
8353192,4,B0026MS3OK,"I found Warrior Built when searching for MMA circuit training information.  I was looking for a more intense workout to help me continue losing weight and build my endurance.  I love the way MMA fighters look and move, so why not work out the same way they do?

Warrior Built uses a variety of bodyweight and cardio exercises (a few of the exercises use a set of dumbells and a medicine ball) to increase your strength and muscular endurance.

The workouts are set up as five-minute rounds, just like in MMA.  Phase 1 starts with 3 five-minute rounds, Phase 2 adds another five-minute round, and Phase 3 adds another five-minute round.

I'm still very heavy (398 pounds), so I was worried I might not be able to physically perform the exercises, but it turns out I was worried about nothing.  I only had to modify a couple of the exercises.

I just finished Week 3 of the 12-week program and I can really see and feel the results.  I'm gaining a lot of functional strength and mobility, and I'm able to stay active for much longer.

The workouts are simple to understand.  They're very effective and give you a great workout when you push yourself.  Andy's a great coach and he really encourages you to keep going when you don't think you can.

I hit a plateau in my weight loss and was stuck at the same weight for a few months, but I broke through that barrier after the first week of using Warrior Built.  Losing two pounds after 3 workouts felt great!

Thanks, Andy!  Warrior Built is an awesome program and it's going to be the cornerstone of my fitness program for a long time to come.  I can't wait to see where I'm at after 12 weeks!",1255046400,,1641,4.416666666666667
