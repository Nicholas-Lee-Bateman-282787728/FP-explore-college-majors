2664164,3,B000IY07EC,"I love Daphne.  Let that be said at the outset.  It may not be the greatest Strauss opera, but it has a warm, gentle beauty to it, and there isn't a single note out of place, so it has a special place in my heart.  For this reason, I was delighted to discover this DVD, and after reading the rave reviews, I was excited to watch it.

I can only say that I came away feeling disappointed.

Not by June Anderson.  Even though the role isn't exactly type-casting (what I wouldn't give to see and hear her in ""The Egyptian Helena,"" for instance!), she does a stunning job that on its own would deserve 5 stars.  The same should be said for Roberto Sacca, who not only sings beautifully (and accurately) but fully captures the spirit of his character, Leukippos.  For that matter, the supporting characters and the orchestra also do a great job.

Unfortunately, one of the key three roles, that of Apollo (Scott MacAllister), is not up to the same level.  His singing is forced (also occasionally inaccurate), and his German pronunciation is sometimes downright embarrassing. Worse yet, his acting is just dreary.  Much of the time, this ""god"" seems tired and passive.  Especially in the great love scene, his Apollo is so apathetic that it's up to Daphne to kiss him instead of vice versa (making hash of a major plot point).  This last may not be entirely his fault, however.  Such a major departure more likely comes from the director, in which case one has to wonder what on earth the director could be thinking.

This brings me to the most disappointing part of this performance: direction and production.  For starters, the staging and costuming are at best lackluster.  A more significant flaw is the lack of movement.  While Daphne is not the most extraverted of operas, it's not an oratorio, and there is no excuse for the director allowing the cast to basically just stand around when the music calls for a little more motion.  In particular, there really is no excuse for such a banal bacchanal!  Never would I have pictured the worship of Bacchus as being so insipid.

However, the greatest sin of omission is the lack of transformation in the Transformation Scene at the end.  This is supposed to be the high point of the opera.  In fact, it is what the whole dramatic action is heading toward: the transformation of Daphne into a tree.  The music is easily the most inspired Strauss wrote for this opera, and as Rudolf Hartmann makes very clear in his book on the staging of Strauss operas, the staging of this transformation can and should demand all the ingenuity a producer can muster.  How shocked he would be to discover the much simpler solution this producer and director came up with: omit transformation altogether and simply have Daphne walk around! Since when do trees do that?!  To be sure, June Anderson and the camera crew do their best not to make it look too foolish or boring, but it really is a woefully inadequate treatment of the transformation scene.  Strauss -- and his gentle, otherworldly Daphne -- deserve so much better.

So...that's why only three stars.  If I were just listening to the music, I would give it four stars (no more, as Apollo would still be sub-par even if we didn't have to watch him), but visually this opera is such a disappointment that my recommendation would be to simply buy a CD of Daphne and imagine the action yourself.",1195084800,12,3381,4.635294117647059
2664165,5,B000IY07EC,"Soprano June Anderson has had many an operatic triumph in her long career;
here however she achieves greatness.  Her performance as Daphne is thrillingly sung and wonderfully acted.  Not since Hilde Gueden has the
role been sung this well.  Anderson reminds me a little of Vanessa Redgrave here.  She brings a purity to her acting and a simplicity proving
that less is indeed more.  I'm comparing Anderson to the highest because
that is the comparison she invites and has earned here.  In fact, the entire production is splendid, running along traditional lines.  Anderson
is surrounded by a fine cast of singing actors, especially Roberto Sacca
as Leukippos, who comes close to evoking memories of the late Fritz Wunderlich in this role.  Highly recommended as a landmark achievement in
the career of June Anderson.  Her height makes you believe she could sacrifice herself into a laurel tree, and her remorse at the end, and
subsequent forgiveness by Apollo is movingly portrayed.  Richard Strauss
would have cheered this performance!!",1186531200,6,1037,5.155688622754491
2664166,5,B000IY07EC,"What a joy to see such a beautiful opera so well performed.  The almost two hours go by in a flash, and you are riveted by the soaring high notes of June Anderson.  The role of Daphne isn't easy, and that's why it's so rare to see or hear this opera.  Also, you have to have two major tenor parts filled, and how often do you get to see that?  But the real joy of this performance must go to June Anderson - like the previous reviewers stated, she is in top form, with no hint of harshness or wobble in the voice, and she sails effortlessly through all the higher passages.  The supporting cast is generally fine, and the orchestra does a good turn at a very difficult score, sounding quite Straussian throughout.  This is a must see for fans of this neglected work, and more importantly for those who have not yet had the pleasure of hearing this glorious music.",1182384000,6,863,4.296296296296297
2664167,5,B000IY07EC,"Solid singing by June Anderson with excellent HD recording techniques made this DVD an experience to enjoy.

2664168,5,B000IY07EC,"I bought this DVD for two reasons: I needed to get to know this rare opera, and because of the review by Mr/Ms Padillo on this site.  Like him, I had never been a June Anderson fan.  At her vocal prime there was always some question about intonation and dramatic involvement.  Unlike other reviews on this site, Mr Padillo was a sceptic whose doubts had been overcome.  Me too!

The quality of the HD dvd is certainly the best I have encountered.  The production is a feast to the eyes: imaginative, creative, staggeringly beautiful.  Ms Anderson doesn't put a foot wrong in this historical recording and -- by any standards -- it is a high point in the careers of all those involved.

You need have no doubts - this is a wonderful achievement.",1178409600,10,744,4.5
2664169,5,B000IY07EC,"I just finished watching Paul Curran's production of ""Daphne"" for La Fenice with June Anderson. While I enjoyed her Lucia some 20 years ago, and several other roles, I never became a real fan of Ms. Anderson's. I was, therefore, stupified at what a completely beautiful performance - breathtaking really - she gives as one of Strauss's oddest heroines. Anderson, whether singing or silent was ever a riveting presence. The voice is firm and beautiful, the high notes - even those wild exposed ""out of nowhere"" notes Strauss complicates the role with, are spot on, radiant with no lurching towards them, just ""there"" every time in perfectly executed attacks. All I could do was say ""wow!""

A simply designed set by Kevin Knight (who also did the excellent costumes) - a large wooden circle laid into the center of the stage floor with (I don't know what you call this) an enormous ring surrounding it - provided plenty of space and managed to convey a place of mystery. Midway, during Apollo's outburst, the center circle rises and moves at various angles as the outer one rises high above it in wild (almost dangerous) configurations as Daphne and others wend their way over and around it - beautifully synchronized to the music - creating an almost liquid-like effect.

This staging does not allow Daphne's physical transformation into an ""actual"" Laurel tree (she doesn't even have a single costume change from her white pajama-type pants, white slippers and long white calf-length vest), but rather, through Anderson's graceful, almost balletic-fluidity, she navigates the constantly shifting circles of the set with a queenly elegance, striking poses beautifully lit and highly affecting. Even sans tree-costume, Anderson makes you believe in Daphne's total transformation. I can in all honesty say this was not at all what I was expecting. Anderson was 53 at this taping and while that is no longer ""old"" for a soprano, it would seem to be pushing it for this role and I cannot praise her beautiful performance enough. I have gooseflesh even writing this!

As Gaea, Birgit Remmert is, likewise, tremendous. Firm of voice, elegant in stature and movement she reminded me a bit of a young Troyanos. Both top notes and low (and Strauss is almost sadisticly fiendish in the vocal requirements for Gaea) she hits everything - at times sounding more baritone than mezzo. It's a rich, excellent performance and Remmert's air of physical lightness contrasted perfectly with Anderson's dreamily gloomy heroine.

Roberto Sacca's Leukippos began fairly well, but only grew better moment-by-moment and by his final scene was heartwrenching and in glorious voice. His violent death provides some of the best lighting effects as Daphne watches in horror. Here, Anderson's bemoaning of his death - both in voice and action as she falls atop his lifeless body, stroking his head, arm, and fingers was nearly unbearable to watch and got me pretty moist around the eyes.

Apollo was Scott MacAllister and in a role that doesn't require much subtlety, he provided none. It's a big sound and he sounded fearless in the music but (and this could be just me) I felt at any minute the voice would pop and break as, while fearless sounding, he never sounded particularly comfortable up there. That he got through this bear of a role in one piece - and in tune - is no simple feat, so kudos to him as well.

The rest of the cast all seemed up to the challenge as well and Stefan Anton Reck conducts the La Fenice forces with great shaping of Strauss's score. The impossibly high, delicate string writing at the end has a bit of scratchiness to it (doesn't it almost always?) and there's a rough spot or two in the difficult horn music, but these truly are minor quibbles when measured against the whole. The chorus, all of the extras, in the Dionysian celebration let loose and the stage is ablaze with color.

During the transformation scene, inset tiny lanterns illuminate the shifting set as Daphne navigates the circles, the lamps at times almost magically illuminating her hands with a golden glow. Combined with that gorgeous music, it is a breathtaking, stunning effect.

David Jacques' lighting designs are positively magical. Towards the lighting becomes a little evocative of ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"" leaving me in equal awe.

What a wonderful surprise this DVD turned out to be! Highly recommended.",1170201600,30,4399,4.941813261163735
2664170,5,B000IY07EC,"As the prior reviewer noted, this is an excellent live recording at the beautifully rebuilt La Fenice in Venice.

June Anderson has moved to Strauss roles as her voice has matured: in addition to Daphne in Venice she has performed Capriccio in Naples.  She is impeccable.  Her fine acting skills honed in all those ""mad scenes"" she has performed are clearly on display here. I also thought her voice blended so beautifully with Birgit Remmert.  Would love to see them as Norma/Adalgisa.

The orchestra sounds crisp and, unlike the prior reviewer, I did not have any problem with its tempi.  I highly recommend this peformance.",1167868800,18,626,4.914285714285715
2664171,5,B000IY07EC,"The Dynamic DVD is of a performance that was recorded at the beautiful Teatro La Fenice di Venezia in 2005.

The director is Paul Curran. Visually this is a charming production with a few stunning scenes. The stage is designed with simplicity: not overloaded but always colorful and imaginative. In the center of the stage there is a big wooden circle, which is encircled by two huge wooden toruses (rings). From about the middle of the opera when the angry Apollo brings in thunderbolts, the huge wooden circles start to rise up and down in various forms and angles and the whole construction is constantly changing its shape. The use of lighting is brilliant. It is especially effective in the finale of the opera, when the orchestra is playing a magnificent orchestral interlude, which portrays Daphne transformation into a tree. The whole construction on stage is faintly illuminated by dozens of small lamps. A ravishing sight! The festival of Dionysus scene is especially colorful, when the stage is crowded with singers and dancers.

The orchestra is conducted by Stefan Anton Reck and plays very well, if at times with relatively broad tempi. Strauss orchestration is masterful as always, and the beautiful pastoral oboe solo in the beginning of the opera is charming.

June Anderson is renowned especially for her Italian and French repertoire. I don't think that she sang a lot of Strauss music in the past (if at all) and now in her fifties she is definitely not in the class of the great Strauss sopranos I know, but I enjoyed her performance and involvement in the role. She is especially moving in the scene where she mourns her lover Leukippos after Apollo murdered him.

Tenor Roberto Sacca is an effective Leukippos. Although he is of an Italian origin, he was born in Germany and sings in excellent German. The other tenor Scott MacAllister sings Apollo with a big voice, and with quite powerful high notes. He will probably be a good Siegfried... Daniel Lewis Williams is an adequate Peneios and mezzo Birgit Remmert is a wonderful Gaea. Her dark and profound voice will make her a very good Erda...

To sum up, judging on musical qualities alone it cannot compete with the best CD recordings (Bohm, Bychkov or Haitink), but by itself this is an excellent DVD and I enjoyed it a lot!!",1165017600,16,2303,4.820253164556962
8147648,5,B000IY07EC,"The performances of the singers, particularly that of June Anderson, are excellent, as is the playing of the orchestra under Stefan Anton Reck.  The staging, which is minimal, adds nothing to the production.  I suppose part of my disappointment relates to expectations based on the venue, La Fenice, which I watched being restored over the years after the disastrous fire in early 1996. It is an exquisite opera house and I had hoped for staging that would comport with the beauty of that house.",1464220800,,495,4.880952380952381
8147649,4,B000IY07EC,"YES!!!  There is another DAPHNE on Film. If that's got your attenction I'll review it and tell you where to get it after I review this one.
FIRST, I am not a rabid June Anderson Fan!  Yet, she is the REAL Reason to own this DVD.  She is Magnificent as DAPHNE!  Both Tenors, Sacca and MacAllister are only a bit better than acceptable; especially when compared to Wunderlich and King who are in the German Film of DAPHNE filmed in the Television Studio in 1964 in an excellent Traditional production in Black & White.  I hope this is tempting you! Then Williams as Peneios and Remmert as Gaea are just barely adequate when compared to Gottlob Frick and Hertha Topper in the 64' Film.  This new Dvd has excellent sound and the production is a minimal set with some Stunning lighting effects.  The really big disapointment is the Transformation scene - nothing happens!  Anderson is wonderful here and she sings and acts very well; BUT, SHE NEVER BECOMES A TREE!!!  Now in 2004 I saw a New York City Opera Production of DAPHNE with Elisabeth Frutral as Daphne and two wonderful Tenors.  It also was a minimal set ; they at least did a token gesture Transformation with a hydraulic lift.  Shades of an oil change.  Stefania Woytowicz sings a wonderfull DAPHNE for German Television but with the magic of camera overlays is really transformed into a tree and quite believably.  Conductor Stefan Anton Reck and the La Fenice di Venezia orchestra do a fine job on this new DVD.  Joseph Keilberth and the Bayersichen Rundfunks are just as good as Bohm on the DGG CDS with the Weiner Symphoniker.  I will watch this DVD again because June Anderson is a GREAT DAPHNE; however, I will much more often watch the ENCORE DVD #2548 because of the entire cast, conductor, production, transformation even in Black & White.
There are a few problems with this ENCORE tape to DVD transfer.  There are one or two pops and tics.  For one or two seconds there is a problem with a damaged stretched tape that was not able to be repaired.  It is B&W.  The Audio was prerecorded in the studio in excellent mono and the lip sync is not always dead on; especially with James King.  However, the Set, costumes, singing, conducting, playing, choreography, sound and especially the CAST make this a must for Fans of these singers.  Fritz Wunderlich on film is a treasure as well as King's Apollo.  Lighting effects are also good.  ENCORE DVDS are for people who are not afraid of older Technology and some Flaws.  They are Private Transfers as far as I can tell.  This One except where noted is very Good.  I got mine at Berkshire Record Outlet which deals with cutouts.  IT IS WORTH LOOKING FOR!  The ENCORE DVD does not have Subtitles or Tracking Nos.",1329436800,,2722,4.591286307053942
8147650,5,B000IY07EC,"Sometimes, less is more, as in this stunning production of Strauss' Daphne.  I am sorry for those who think June Anderson is not really suited for the role.  She most definitely is!  The simple staging and costumes allow the viewer to concentrate on the sheer beauty of the music and her voice. Sacca and Mac Allister are also in fine voice as the two rivals for Daphne's attentions. All principals,including the director and conductor, do justice to the material.  I must admit to having shed a tear or two as the music closed on Daphne's metamorphosis. For those who love Strauss, be sure to get the Hilde Gueden recording, with Karl Bohm at the helm.",1321315200,,653,4.6521739130434785
8147651,2,B000IY07EC,"The electric and magical air of the Bohm recording is missing from this, mainly because the conductor doesn't come close to matching Bohm, but also because the soloists also don't come close to matching his.",1305244800,,207,4.942857142857143
8147652,5,B000IY07EC,"Anderson in the role of Daphn, touching opra by Richard Strauss.
J Anderson in more heavy and dramatic roles, don't be missed",1298505600,,125,4.7272727272727275
8147653,5,B000IY07EC,"""Daphne"", like Strauss' other late works, is a rarity in the opera house; and it is not likely to become popular with the average operagoer. But it is a very beautiful work. It is richly melodious, with expectedly expert vocal writing. And it is the first example of the wonderfully luminous orchestral sound which Strauss would cultivate in his last decade - his ""Indian Summer"", in the words of biographer Norman Del Mar. It is nice to have the opera on DVD in such a generally excellent production. Watching it on stage, I was surprisingly conscious of the flat, verbose libretto by Josef Gregor. Gregor was a handicap Strauss also had to overcome in ""Friedenstag"" and ""Die Liebe der Danae"". In each case the beautiful music wins the day, but it was an uphill struggle.
The conductor, Stefan Anton Reck, was unknown to me, but he does a fine job, pacing the opera convincingly and drawing beautiful playing from the orchestra. June Anderson is a wonderful Daphne. In the world of ideals she is too old for the part, but she sings beautifully, spinning out those high lines with ease. And she moves with remarkable grace and poise. She is well partnered by Roberto Sacc. Leukippos is one of Strauss' more singable tenor roles, and Sacc makes good use of his lovely lyric voice and good dramatic skills. By contrast, Apollo is on of Strauss' impossible tenor parts, requiring Wagnerian power in a cruelly high tessitura. Scott Mac Allister sings it so convincingly that it might seem churlish to complain that he doesn't look very godlike and that his acting is stiff. Birgit Remmert is a lovely Gaea, making the part more than a study in low notes. Daniel Lewis Williams is a solid Peneios. It is a pleasant surprise to have the Shepherds and the Maids cast with such fine voices.
I rather like the minimal/abstract production. The costumes are lovely; the stage, with its movable concentric circles, is intriguing; and the lighting is imaginative. Some reviewers complain that there is no tree for the transformation scene, but I really don't mind. It seems to me that suddenly introducing such an elaborate piece of stage machinery would clash with the rest of the production, with its temporally non-specific costuming and lack of representational scenery. Anderson's beautifully choreographed movement complements the orchestral postlude, which features Strauss' orchestral writing at its most magical.
In comparing this DVD to earlier audio recordings some invoke the 1964 Deutsche Grammophon recording, which I never liked much. The best thing about it is the beautifully sung Leukippos of Fritz Wunderlich; the other leads are less good. I always loved Hilde Gueden, and she was probably a good Daphne a decade earlier; she was past her vocal prime for this performance, and her singing is labored. James King makes heavy weather of Apollo's music; fine singer though he was, the role sounds uncomfortably high for him. Karl Bhm conducts the opera well - after all, it was dedicated to him! But he also makes large and damaging cuts, most seemingly intended to make things easier for Gueden and King. The standard-setting audio recording is the 1983 EMI album, well-conducted by Bernard Haitink, with a fine cast. Lucia Popp never sang Daphne on stage, but the role suited her to a T; her rapturously beautiful singing is unmatched. Peter Schreier was also in top form as Leukippos; he is second only to Wunderlich, who had a more intrinsically beautiful sound. Apollo is one of Reiner Goldberg's better efforts. He sensibly sings lyrically, never pushing beyond his comfort zone; but as usual, he rarely seems to know what he's singing about. Ortrun Wenkel is a sonorous Gaea and Kurt Moll a bluff, powerful Peneios. It is shameful that this fine recording remains out of print!
Update: The Haitink ""Daphne"" has been reissued by Arkivmusic.com. It's well worth checking out.",1281312000,2,3884,4.967741935483871
8147654,4,B000IY07EC,"This is definitely not the ultimate Daphne. June Andersson is a consumate pro, but she can't make me forget Rene Fleming in this role. The rest of the cast is very much OK, as is the orchestra. The same goes for Paul Currans production: not world shocking, but it certainly has its merits. What seduced me most was the stunning HD quality of this release. Bearing in mind that this is the only available dvd of this interesting Strauss opera, I rate it with a four star review.",1273449600,,477,4.431818181818182
8147655,3,B000IY07EC,"Daphne is some of R. Strauss's most gorgeous music.  Unfortunately, the show is almost never performed.  Further more, this is the ONLY DVD version available.  I fear that there are 3 things working against the opera that prevent it from being performed more frequently.  1) the role of Daphne is incredibly difficult.  No, the high notes are not the highest written, and no, the opera is not hours long.  However, for the entire hour and a half (no intermission), the role consistently sits in a very high place for a lyric soprano.  There is almost no middle voice implemented throughout the score.  Rene Fleming recently made a CD recording and openly admitted that should would never perform the role in a fully-staged live performance (although I don't believe this was an appropriate role for her in the first place).  June Anderson has the notes, but again, it's the wrong voice for the role.  2)  the role of Gaea requires the performance of the lowest note written for a woman EVER.  It's a low E, and a stretch even for some tenors.  Let's be honest it's even on the low side of the middle range for baritones!  Finally reason 3)  At the end of the opera, Daphne turns into a tree, in front of the audience, while singing (at least that is what is meant to be conveyed).  This production didn't even try.  Walking in a circle does not have any significance to turning into a tree.  Come on!

Needless to say, I was disappointed with this DVD.  I really do believe that the score itself is some of the most glorious and moving music written for the operatic stage.  Daphne's final scene ""Ich komme..."" get's to me every time I listen to it.  My suggestion, find a recording on the EMI label with Lucia Popp singing Daphne.  It is currently out of production, but there are some old copies floating around out there.  Her voice is absolutely pristine and exactly what the role needs.  I find that listening to that recording is far more moving than this DVD.  Although, I do appreciate the fact that someone made an attempt (although a lack-luster one) to put this magnificent opera onto film.  I think 3 stars is fair.",1225065600,9,2127,4.587765957446808
8147656,5,B000IY07EC,"the stage set is very cool !  and because it was done in 2004, i believe, the video quality is very high.  as always, june anderson's high notes just float up there with efficace ; the 2 tenors do a heck of a job with their demanding roles.  i own most of strauss's operas on DVDs and CDs, and this is one of the most ""different"" that i've experienced so far, musically speaking.  it is almost naughty to my ears, in a very very good way",1213660800,3,437,4.046511627906977
8147657,4,B000IY07EC,"The staging of this 2005 production is quite interesting, because it works in all its modesty. It is, of course, a matter of taste, but I like a sober approach, because it brings your attention to the centerpieces of an opera: music, words and acting skills.

June Anderson, 52 at the time of this production, is in fine voice. Perhaps, at times, her voice is a bit too dramatic for portraying a young girl's laments, but her portrayal of the innocent Daphne is sincere and she uses her acting skills to great effect.

I wish I could say the same about Scott Mac Allister's Apollo. Surely, the voice is there and it has a commanding presence suited for the role - which reminds me a bit of James King's beautiful tenor voice - but at times he just forgets to act! He also seems to have some trouble reaching for the high notes, although, if I'm not mistaken, he reaches them all.

Roberto Sacca is a fine Leukippos with a ringing voice.

The playing of the Orchestra of La Fenice under Stefan Anton Reck is fine and consistent, although not extraordinary in any way.

The sound and video quality are excellent.

Let's come to a conclusion (in which I compare this recording to my favourite: the 1964 live production on Deutsche Grammophon (only audio)): June Anderson is no Hilde Guden, Scott Mac Allister no James King, Roberto Sacca no Fritz Wunderlich, and, finally, Stefan Anton Reck is no Karl Bohm. I would say: These days are gone and we have to deal with that.

But: it is a throughout enjoyable production, captured by modern technology (no audience noises like in the 1964 production), with fine singing and playing in an interesting set design. Furthermore: it is the only commercial release of this Strauss opera on dvd to date!

So: buy and enjoy this neglected masterpiece!",1208044800,4,1787,4.650793650793651
