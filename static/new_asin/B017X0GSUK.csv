8740917,5,B017X0GSUK,"In ""Discover and Do Level K"" you'll observe nearly 100 different science experiments. Not only that, you'll learn how to do the experiments yourself - in the comfort of your own home!

You'll learn what makes planes fly and why you can't taste things when you have a cold. You'll grow plants from beans, make a weather vane, and build a sailboat. You'll do all these things and much more.

Filled with fascinating science experiments and peppered with humor, this video is an ideal supplement to your child's science education.

Enjoy!",1508025600,,535,4.857142857142857
