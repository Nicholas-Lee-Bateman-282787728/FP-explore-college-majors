8687534,4,B00PCSVMV6,"This is a deep Documentary that shares the biography of an interesting group and their plight through the many years of their gigs and legendary range of Rock n Roll. This is an expressive documentary that explores the wonder of music through one group. One true rock and roll band. One of the hardest New Jersey rock 'n roll bands throughout history. This band and documentary give the true meaning to the art form of music and to the art form of the love and passion of rock 'n roll. This is a brilliant education into this dynamic music band and the many years of their music kingdom. Sadly like all good masterly things the world takes hold and twist and turns what was already brilliant. The original Rye Coalition and the spiral and twist into The Hard Luck 5 and the ultimate break up, but most of all the reunited moments as fans still want the music and the art form. This film truly shines in their legacy.

8687535,5,B00PCSVMV6,"This DVD is a must for any Rye Coalition fan.  It is way better than the DVD that comes with the Curses CD.

It really is an awesome story, but a terribly sad one at the same time.",1423872000,,180,3.710526315789474
