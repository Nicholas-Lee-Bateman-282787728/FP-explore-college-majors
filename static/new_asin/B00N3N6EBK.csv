6608635,1,B00N3N6EBK,"I rented this movie because it had good reviews.  Well the reviews are obviously fake because this move was atrocious.  It could not be more cliche.  A poorly done literal cliff hanging that we have all seem a million times.  ""Oh, I forgot, I have a gun strapped to my ankle!""",1412035200,3,276,4.352941176470588
6608636,5,B00N3N6EBK,"I want to thank the six people that reviewed this movie before I rented it, you are the reason that I did rent it, and you were spot on.  It is a great movie.  This is what can happen when everything goes right in the making of a movie.  Big kudos to the director, the entire production crew and the actors.  This movie was so well cast, and the cast was so believable.  They just grabbed this film and ran with all their might.  This movie starts out pretty quiet, but man, it doesn't stay that way.  I love a great thriller, and this one really did have me on the edge of my chair in the end.  I did have just a tiny quibble with two things that happened in the end, I would have done them just a little differently, and I feel like the end could have been even more impactful.  I'm not a spoiler, so I have to leave it at that.",1411776000,2,830,3.9518072289156625

6608638,5,B00N3N6EBK,This is a great thriller.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of it.  I can't believe this movie did not get more buzz.  I found out about it through On Demand.  Highly recommended!!!,1411430400,,186,3.945945945945946

6608640,5,B00N3N6EBK,"I can proudly say I was the lead visual effects artist on this movie and it ended up being one of the best titles I ever worked on in terms of cinematography / shooting quality (despite they used a Digital Arri Camera instead of 35mm), in terms of final result and of course in terms of movie as an entertainment product.

The story is somewhat of very compelling and very believable, it drags you in from beginning to end and the actors are just really phenomenally good. This is a hell of a thriller movie and -trust me- you will not be disappointed: you will carry in your body the adrenaline that this one gives you. As somebody else perfectly said, the suspense of this movie is a real heart in your throat experience.

Thank you Lionsgate for giving us the chance of working on such a great, great movie.",1410825600,4,810,4.3933333333333335
6608641,4,B00N3N6EBK,Call this one the little movie that could.  I can't even tell you when I enjoyed a movie this much.  What's so great about it is that it manages to be both incredibly romantic and dramatic but also action packed and suspenseful.  Rachelle Lefevre is dynamite in this.  Watching her and Ryan Phillipe get everything they ever wanted only to have it taken away and then have to fight to get it back was awesome.  John Cusack is the bad guy and incredibly convincing-- this movie would be worth watching for his performance alone but then when you add Ryan and Rachelle's performances PLUS Jacki Weaver and Luis Guzman PLUS some heart in your throat chase scenes PLUS a little girl named Briana Roy who will steal you heart-- it really is an abundance of riches in such a small film.  Hats off to the writers and director and to Lionsgate I hope you really work hard so that this one gets seen -- it really is that good!,1410566400,48,917,4.396449704142012
6608642,5,B00N3N6EBK,"First I have to say I never write reviews but I was able to see a preview of this movie and I was completely blown away.  Thrillers aren't really my thing but my boyfriend wanted to go so I tagged along and all I can say is WOW!  I didn't even know that they made movies like this anymore!  Whoever wrote this really had their act together and the director really knew what they were doing.  I'm not even sure how to describe it-- it was full of action and soooo supenseful but I guess what made it so compelling to watch were the characters.  They were just regular people caught up in this trap and I was rooting for them so hard.  Literally, I loved them!  Ryan Phillipe and Rachelle Lefevre make such a good married couple you would believe they were really married and the little kid is absolutely a revelation as their daughter.  Plus there was Luis Guzman who is awesome, Jacki Weaver who is awesome and John Cusack who I've loved forever and played the hell out of his bad boy role.  I guess I'm just rambling now but I really want people to see this.  If you are a parent especially you will love it but even not it's a thrilling emotional rollercoaster that I am so glad I saw!",1410393600,14,1187,4.235555555555556

6608653,5,B00N3N6EBK,"Every year 1.7 million children are the victims of human trafficking, there could be more that is being unreported.  Steven and Shannon (played by Ryan Phillippe and Rachelle Lefevre) is an American couple that is unable to have children of their own due to a previous auto accident.  Now they wish to try their luck and adopt a child from a third world country, Haiti.  They pay over $100,000 to the adoption agency for all of the expenses to adopt the child.  The couple later discovers that the adoption is a ruse.  I must say that John Cusack is at it again and plays his role well in Reclaim.  Reclaim is inspired by true events.

One day their adopted child, Nina, goes missing, while they are still awaiting her birth certification/passport.  Steven and Shannon realizes that Nina had been a pawn in the game that Benjamin (Cusack) and Reigert (played by Jackie Weaver) had been playing on couples for years.  What Benjamin and Reigert does not realize is that Steven and Shannon is not going to be a victim of the ruse.  Shannon is adamant about finding Nina and returning to the U.S. as promised and then the story gets interesting.",1467244800,,1141,4.6318407960199

6608668,4,B00N3N6EBK,"Heard about this film from others so we rented it. It really keeps you watching throughout, there's never a dull moment. It's a suspense film and the basic plot is: an American couple adopts a baby from another country and goes to Puerto Rico to pick up the child; a few days later the child disappears and the couple discovers they were scammed by a child trafficking team; they are then kidnapped for more money and have to escape.

All the acting is very good and the characters are believable. Although the actors are famous, we hadn't heard of this film. It was filmed in Puerto Rico and the locations are beautiful. The DVD has extras such as director's commentary, interviews, behind the scenes, etc.

It is a film you can re-watch and we recommend seeing this film. However, the Amazon price is too high to buy right now. At $10 or less, it's a film worth owning. Cheers!",1451433600,,879,4.522012578616352

The premise is that they go to Costa Rica to finalize the adoption of their daughter and upon seeing her they automatically fall in love with her - she is  no baby however but is getting to know and love the couple who will take her to her new home!

I won't go further than this because there is sooo much excitement and triple turns and tweeks; --one of which I expected. I'll say Cusack was horrible - good horrible but horrible.

Just get the damn movie - I'm telling you it's one of the best I've seen and I'm so glad I bought it (instant streaming) because I plan to watch it again and again and again!",1442707200,3,783,4.131578947368421

6608677,2,B00N3N6EBK,"An American couple Steven (Ryan Phillippe) and Shannon (Rachelle Lefevre) travel to Puerto Rico to adopt a seven-year-old girl named Nina orphaned in Haiti, Nina is a lovely girl and Steven and Shannon are happy to begin a new life with her, but before the proceedings are finalized, Nina goes missing. They are at a loss in a strange land when a mysterious American traveler Benjamin (John Cusack) approaches to them.

Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (Animal Kingdom Silver Lining Playbook) is in a cameo role. Luis Guzmn also appears as a Puerto Rican police detective.

The story itself sounds great and the film benefits from the beautiful on-location photography and capable acting from Cusack. The director did a poor job in fleshing out the story, however, with cardboard characters making a series of stupid decisions. In fact, the films story moves on in the most mechanical way, employing clichd narrative techniques here and there.

After all, Reclaim is supposed to be a thriller, but there is nothing thrilling about following the worn-out plot and one dimensional characters.",1440028800,,1084,5.112994350282486

Ryan Phillippe and Rachel Lefevre play just such a couple and are wonderful but I have to admit to being a huge Ryan Phillippe fan. They make the usual movie mistakes but I don't hate them for it, usually I roll my eyes and shake my head. The gang of bad guys, yes, they are BAD. Lead by John Cusack whose slimey, smarmy condescending attitude makes him a very evil guy is terrific. You truly hate him. Suspenseful and not at all a bad movie to sit and devour.

6608748,3,B00N3N6EBK,"Reclaim focuses on a wealthy married couple, Steven (Ryan Phillippe) and Shannon (Rachelle Lefevre), who arrive in the Dominican Republic to meet their newly adopted daughter, seven-year-old Nina (Briana Roy), a Haitian orphan whose family died in the 2010 earthquake. After dealing with adoption agent Mrs. Reigert (Jackie Weaver, Silver Linings Playbook), the new family is sent to an exotic resort while they wait for the childs passport to arrive. During their stay, they encounter Benjamin (John Cusack) and find themselves involved in a million-dollar scam. The film moves along briskly as the puzzle pieces of the scam become clear to the couple and the viewer.

Cusack plays a sleazy bad guy whose aggressive attempts at feigned friendship are appropriately creepy, if somewhat overacted.  This R-rated tale of double crosses, corruption, and extortion uses the theme of placing innocents in a web of intrigue and danger  a theme Alfred Hitchcock drew upon in film after film. The script has flaws, but director Alan White makes Steven and Shannon sympathetic and develops suspense along the way.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include director commentary, deleted and extended scenes, interviews with cast and crew, music video, and making-of featurette.",1416787200,,1273,5.414141414141414

6608751,2,B00N3N6EBK,"Though this does happen all the time, to very gullible people. The ones that fall for Nigerian or lottery scams by e-mail. The story could have been good, except it's a typical ... I'm as stupid as a rock and lets see how many times I can give the bad guy a chance at killing me. Lets knock him in the head, then throw the gun next to him, and run into the woods so he can chase me again ... mentality. Some say it's what makes it exciting, I say after watching them be total idiots, they deserve whatever happens to them. But this happens in all movies today and I hate stupidity. Myself, I knock him out, I tie him up. I keep the gun pointed at him, until the cops show up. You know the commercials today where the kids say, lets get in the running car ... oh no, lets hide under the chainsaws ... this IS IT! (:",1415145600,22,814,4.0
6608752,3,B00N3N6EBK,"Good story with Cusack as a horrendous, almost unbelievable villain.  (We never get his motivation -- but his ""reality"" is effective for the story.)  A good harrowing tale but not sure it's one you need to see more than once, much less own.",1415145600,,240,4.558139534883721

6608766,3,B00N3N6EBK,"Could of been better. I think the writers did a horrible job when it came to navigating their characters. So female parent swings a poker stick at Cusack, tells child to hide or run, then she runs out the building into the forest, leaving her husband locked in the trunk of a car? You see her run down this path to an abandoned building with Cusack on her tail. Then dramatic music kicks in and she is about to die because she ran up some stairs only to jump down the side of a building and hurt her ankle. It's only a matter of time now. Seriously? How stupid is that? Why even run up the stairs to only come back down? Why not just skip the building and keep on running? Or better yet, lets rewind and knock Cusack out, tie him up and then call police. And then get your husband out of trunk. Just saying.",1413504000,11,807,4.113924050632911

6608768,3,B00N3N6EBK,"""This scam that you're talking about might be true but it also might not be so you have to keep looking for her."" Shannon (Lefevre) and Steven (Phillippe) are Americans who have traveled to another country in order to pick up the daughter they have adopted. The girl loves them instantly and the parents feel the same way. When they wake up one morning and find her gone they run to the police who tell them about a common adoption scam that is being run. The new parents decide to take it upon themselves to get her back anyway they can. This is a movie that I wasn't expecting a whole lot from but was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this. The movie was tense and gripping almost the entire time. The emotion of parents having their child taken really helps you get sucked in and you are right there with them hoping they find the girl. While it is sometimes predictable it doesn't distract from the intensity and I liked this quite a but. Overall, a gripping movie about a real problem in the world that I recommend watching. I give this a B.",1413158400,7,1053,4.350253807106599

Not a hair was out of place, no sweat was broken, no clothes were crinkled while they were supposed to be devastated about the disappearance of their newly adopted daughter.  Yeah, right ... At least John Cusack at least lloked like  a real person, bute he alone wasn't enough to keep me going. Sorry.",1412640000,2,484,4.488636363636363
6608771,2,B00N3N6EBK,"Steven (Ryan Phillippe) and Shannon (Rachelle Lefevre) well off Americans travel to Puerto Rico to adopt Nina (Briana Roy) a Haitian orphan. While there they keep bumping into Benjamin (John Cusack). Between the faux-drama, characters, and title, it isn't hard to figure out what is going on.

The plot was so formula and so cliche, it was difficult to watch this ""cliff hanger.""  When Shannon asked, ""How do you live with yourself?"" I was thinking the same thing for the script writers.

The actors had nothing to work with. It was nice to see Cusack in a film for more than 10 minutes, unfortunately it was this one

The film was done as a means to show the invisible children in this world and the scams that are out there. Nice cause. Boring execution.  Lifetime film fans who love formula cliche filled films, might like this one.
