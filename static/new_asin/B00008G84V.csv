7983049,5,B00008G84V,"In BLIND FEAR, Shelley Hack plays a blind woman named Erica Green, trapped in a deserted lodge w/ three desperate criminals. The good news is that they don't know she's there (at first). The bad news is that one of the crooks is a murderous psychopath! As the story unfolds, Erica must stay out of sight, while trying to outsmart the increasingly paranoid bad guys. The real fun begins when the maniac of the group finds Erica's hiding place. If you enjoy similar films like WAIT UNTIL DARK or SEE NO EVIL, then you should add this one to your collection!... P.S.- The finale is one for the ages!...",1361232000,,599,4.504587155963303
7983050,4,B00008G84V,"No one will ever confuse Shelley Hack with Audrey Hepburn (remember ""Wait Until Dark""?) but, IMHO, she does an excellent job here as the blind damsel in danger.  I was totally absorbed in the action, and couldn't wait to see how it turned out.  **Warning:  the ending is a real kicker.  For those of you who enjoy ""Sons of Anarchy"", here's a chance to see Kim Coates as a young psycho, pre-leather and -tattoos.  All in all, a decent undiscovered gem, much better than Mia Farrow's ""See No Evil"".",1339459200,3,496,4.52808988764045
7983051,2,B00008G84V,"Former Charlie Girl and Charlie's Angel Shelley Hack receives top billing in this low-budget bore though the cover art proclaims it ""a tale of gothic suspense"". Actually, Shelley's big episode ""Of Ghosts and Angels"" deserves that title more than this snoozer.

Hack plays a blind switchboard operator at a remote Maine Inn, being shut down after being sold. Somehow this coincides with the robbery of an armored truck taking place nearby involving three criminals (two men, one woman) who eventually shoot the guards and seek retreat in the abandoned Inn.

The rest of the movie has Shelley, looking as far from the Tiffany Welles fashion-plate character as possible in a baggy sweater, ankle socks and plain canvas sneakers, trying to outsmart the bad guys by throwing the breaker and trying to hide from them (on her own terms, see?) a la Audrey Hepburn in ""Wait Until Dark"".

The bad guys have more lines than Shelley. The only reason they become aware of her presence is because the pizza that arrives from an androgynous delivery boy in denim short-shorts only has anchovies on HALF of it. So there must be someone else at the Inn besides the tight-lipped old handyman they strangled to death earlier.

I admit I didn't see the twist at the end coming, so there was a bit of a payoff,  and the way Shelley disposes of the bad girl is inspired, but rent before you buy. For completists who want to see everything the Angels have ever done. Even when found in a bargain bin, this one's NOT a keeper.",1306108800,2,1502,4.695817490494297
7983052,5,B00008G84V,"This film takes you by the hand, and leads you in the wrong direction. I was floored by the ending!",1260230400,2,99,4.0
7983053,5,B00008G84V,"Shelley Hack deemed as the angel who can't act, actually, I thought she acted better than Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd in the 4th season but this should be with the Charlie's Angels review, proves she can act. Blind Fear has been compared with Audrey Hepburn's ""Wait Until Dark"" but the movie is completely different and Hack makes the movie. Shelley plays Erica, a blind switchboard operator at the inn. She is forced to stay overnight because her cousin can't pick her up until the next morning. She plays a game of hide and seek with three murderous thugs, who robbed an armored security truck for a million dollars. Hack uses her resources against the thugs. Amazingly Hack looks younger then she did on Charlie's Angels 10 years ago. There is a surprise twist at the end but like the other reviewers, I can't be a jerk and ruined it all for you. Buy it and you will like it.",1257206400,10,879,4.5
7983054,4,B00008G84V,"I really enjoy this movie. It was released years ago on video and laser disc and I am glad it is now on dvd.

Shelley Hack is one of those actors I really enjoy watching. There's a special charisma on her that holds you back while watching her. Will she do it or can she do it, sort of questions all thime while you're watching her. That's make her really interesting. It's the same thing with her turn in her movie THE STEPFATHER. I think, she's under rated as an actor.

But anyhow, buy this and enjoy....",1114214400,5,507,4.216494845360825
7983055,5,B00008G84V,"I love Shelley Hack.  I think she is an underrated actress.  This DVD is fun, suspensful, and exciting.  The price is just right.  Good fun.  There is also a great twist ending.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Fantastic.",1096761600,7,237,4.372093023255814
