The last Christopher Reeves in his pre-paralyzed years narrates this film that not only explores dinasaurs in eductional terms but they're impact on pop culture. It is a very fun show,it aired on network TV in the mid 80's but would do very well on PBS.And it taught me a valuable lesson as a child-dinasaurs became extinct,perhapes because of thee asteroid collision depicted here or not. But in  one form or another (namely the Ostrich and the alligator) have evolved and survived. So dinasaurs and their history give us an important lesson about the instinct to survive no matter what is in your way. And beyond that ask any kid,even today and they'll likely say their favorite animal is the dinasaur because they're so different but because for creatures so based in instinct they dominated the Earth perhapes even longer then we humans have. And as this show depicts that may be why these

giant,exotic reptiles fascinate us so.",1115683200,2,1096,4.824468085106383

As a dinosaur enthusiest, I have to say this is probably one of the best documentaries about the group. The best into to the ""rediscovery of Dinosaurs"" and how we think of them now. And as a film student in animation, I must say that this is some of the best stop motion animation of dinos I have seen. Other great dino animation docs can be seen in: The Dinosaur four part series and Discovery Channels Ultimate Guide: T-rex. This is a wonderful show. I hightly recommend this to anyone. Great for kids and adults, even if its a bit old, this is the first documentary to present the ""Dinosaur Reconnaisance"" or our new views on dinosaurs led by the work of Dr. Robert Bakker, Dr. John Ostrom and Dr. John Horner among others. This is a must have.",1112659200,,823,4.316129032258065
7853092,5,6303626963,"I've had this (taped off of the Disney Channel) since I was a kid, and I still love it, 16 years after it was produced.  It's almost flawless in every area.  It covers all the bases, from scientific knowledge to how dinosaurs are portrayed in entertainment.  There are quite a few stop-motion action sequences of the dinosaurs, which hold up to this day.  The best and most shocking is the one involving a Struthiomimus and two of the Deinonychus.  It makes ""Jurassic Park"" look tame in comparison; watch it and you'll see what I mean.  Nearly as shocking is the sequence featuring the battle between a T-Rex and the one-horned Monoclonius.  Highly recommended!",985824000,4,661,4.79646017699115
