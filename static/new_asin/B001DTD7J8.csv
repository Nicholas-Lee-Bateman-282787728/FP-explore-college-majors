I really don't like how she shows how to braid in the extension hair. The technique that she does is too hard. This was a great dvd but it could of been better. The video quality was good,and the instructions were good. But she could of talked more about how to care for you're micro braids and a better way of braiding in the hair extensions.",1249171200,,520,4.316326530612245
8294860,3,B001DTD7J8,"Was not a bad video just found it to short for viewing and allot of the steps were not shown. I was very disappointed in the way the braid was not secured or at least a part of the vid showing how to close the micro braid by tieing or by nail glue not bad. On a positive side she did emphasize how to initiate the micro braid so now I am my own pro at starting a micro braid, thank you Marquetta.",1243209600,,396,3.783132530120482
8294861,5,B001DTD7J8,"This video was accurate and clear. It was very informative and her instructions were clear and concise. Ms. Breslin made this seem really easy, I intend on buying a few more of these DVD's also. They are great to have if you are like me. I have girls and I have a hard time keeping their hair done and it simply costs too much to take them to the salon every month. I decided to learn how to braid and twist and do micro's so that I can keep my girls' hair done withouth having to pay an arm and a leg. I am definately going to buy more of these dvd's.",1227744000,9,552,3.9375
8294862,5,B001DTD7J8,Excellent braiding video!  Easy to understand.  I will be buying her other videos!,1149897600,9,82,5.230769230769231
