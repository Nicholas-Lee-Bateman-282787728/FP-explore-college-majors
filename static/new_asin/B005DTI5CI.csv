I wish he would perform in the US because I will be one of the first to buy his tickets no matter how much it costs!!  I truly think he is a GREAT singer, performer, actor, and person :)  I will continue to support him :)  Amazon must continue to provide his music and movies online in the US!",1438646400,,438,3.769230769230769

If you are interested in in a 2 DVD version, you should purchase this other album also available from the same seller ASIN# B0089F9O3C.",1366761600,2,259,4.777777777777778
8467433,4,B005DTI5CI,"I first like Rain as an actor, so I decided to buy his concert dvd to see if I like his singing. He is a great actor and an amazing dancer, but his singing was just o.k. It wasn't terrible, but his voice can't compare to Jang Guen Suk and Song Seung Heon for example. If you want to hear Korean music from actors I would buy Jang Guen Suk and Song Seung Heon CDs instead. I rated this dvd 4 stars because I love Rain's overall performance (dancing) and stage presence (charisma). I would still recommend people to buy this dvd because he really is an excellent performer - dancer and has a smile and charisma that could light up the whole in this case concert stadium. Even if you don't understand Korean, you'll fall in love with his performance. But if you want to see Rain's in concert, buy ""Rain The Best Show Live Concert"" on Blu-ray. This is a better Rain's live performance, his singing sounds better (he really improved vocally), all the songs is really good and the whole show itself is really entertaining from beginning to end. Hope you go out and buy this Blu-ray you won't regret it.",1357948800,2,1096,4.377450980392157
