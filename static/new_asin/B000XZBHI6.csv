8230322,5,B000XZBHI6,Be weary of the reviews. It seemed that Amazon combined the official release of this movie with the bootleg dvd copies of this movie. Anything prior to April 10 2018 should not be taken into consideration in regards to the official blu-ray release.,1524182400,3,248,4.790697674418604

8230327,2,B000XZBHI6,"This DVD box is actually a unofficial copy of the GARO series as there is no official US release. The subtitles are sub-par and video quality is slightly below SD. The official DVD to this miniseries had combined the two episodes into a ""movie"" and sold only in Japanese channels and Ebay, please check the official site to verify the actual DVD series sold to you. There are better versions available online. There are fansubs made in higher quality and it's on YouTube if you simply want to watch it. Not worth buying.",1283990400,9,520,4.602150537634409
8230328,2,B000XZBHI6,do not buy this unless you speak japanese!!! the subtitles are black with a white background making them mostly unreadable. when i bought my copy the dick seemed to skip whole scenesvery saddening,1279584000,3,196,4.96969696969697
