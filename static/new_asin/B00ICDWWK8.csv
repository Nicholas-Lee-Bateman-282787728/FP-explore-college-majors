8640834,5,B00ICDWWK8,"No better series anywhere. We took it out from Netflix so many times that we decided we needed to own it. The story and characters stay with you long after you have watched the DVD's. I can't recommend it highly enough.  I just wish they had made another season. You will fall in love with Previous, her wonderfully funny assistant and all other characters.",1409875200,4,357,4.578125
