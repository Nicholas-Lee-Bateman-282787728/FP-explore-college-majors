6757079,4,B00OMCL5NS,"The production value of the host part of the show is low, but the content is solid and entertaining.  It's nice to see a show like this with out having to watch commercials.",1426809600,3,173,4.242424242424242
6757080,1,B00OMCL5NS,Not too funny!!,1426636800,,15,4.333333333333333
6757111,3,B00OMCL5NS,VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY,1438214400,,23,5.0
6757112,1,B00OMCL5NS,"This was just bad. I waited longer than I should have for it to get funny. It never got funny. I could barely even understand what SHOULD have been a half hour of jokes because the audio was totally crappy. Most of it was poorly-done re-enactments of random stories that were probably made up in some kid's basement while drinking warm Schlitz.
I sat through an entire episode before my spleen started to bleed...you know, from the stupidity.
Bottom line: this is horrible. Watch it only if you hate yourself. And your spleen.",1438214400,2,526,4.666666666666667
6757113,4,B00OMCL5NS,Not bad. Some of it is so silly.,1434412800,,32,3.125
6757114,3,B00OMCL5NS,It's dumb alright. Sadly like most shows of this genre the announcer really spoils it. After watching 3 or 4 episodes it gets to be too much to bear.,1433203200,,149,4.172413793103448
6757115,2,B00OMCL5NS,"The Co-hosts were designed to be idiotic, not a good thing. I could see that they changed their  location setting from first to second season as if this could have been the problem, but it wasn't. Some of the clips were hilarious, but all in all the rest was not. Did watch most of it for the clips. Oh yeah, weren't crazy about overuse of the ""wacky"" sound effects.",1432944000,,366,4.304347826086956
6757116,4,B00OMCL5NS,Hilarious as hell!! Takes your mind off the daily stress of life.,1431907200,,65,4.5
6757117,1,B00OMCL5NS,This is so terrible that I'm not sure anyone has ever sat through an entire episode.,1431648000,,84,4.3125
6757118,1,B00OMCL5NS,Dumb show.,1428537600,,10,4.5

6757120,2,B00OMCL5NS,This show sucks,1427328000,,15,4.333333333333333
8684259,5,B00OMCL5NS,"but oh my goodness! they did not have a camera on every phone and not many people owned a video camera. Yes they are reenactments not actual video.

For what it was back in the day it was amusing and usually entertaining. Sorry theres no blood guts and gore to satisfy your blood lust",1475193600,,284,4.2592592592592595
8684260,1,B00OMCL5NS,"So bad, and it's NOT the good kind of B movie bad, where it's so deliciously cheesy. I wish it were. I am convinced the videos are dramatized and not real videos. At least in season 2. What criminals are about to rob a bank, look at each other,  pretend to sync their watches, give each other thumbs up and then run in the bank? No way, I don't believe it for a second....lol....see what I mean for yourself: season 2 episode 3 around the 10 minute mark.

I didn't make it a whole episode. The current seasons are okay, but for the life of me, I don't know how they didn't get canceled long before they got better. Someone owed someone a favor...lol",1471651200,,649,4.225806451612903
8684261,1,B00OMCL5NS,Terrible show. Looks to be predominantly staged.,1446940800,,48,6.0
8684262,1,B00OMCL5NS,"Poor quality. Video was grainy, jokes were stupid and the production values were bad.",1446249600,,85,5.142857142857143
8684263,1,B00OMCL5NS,worst audio ever,1446163200,,16,4.666666666666667
8684264,2,B00OMCL5NS,Little too dated and most of the video quality is terrible.,1446163200,,59,4.454545454545454
8684265,5,B00OMCL5NS,I enjoyed it very much.,1443139200,3,23,3.8
8684266,1,B00OMCL5NS,First season was way better this should've just let the police talk about what happened. This was soo not funny.,1440979200,,112,4.65
8684267,2,B00OMCL5NS,"The hosts were annoying, over the top, and distracting--trying to make this a ""real news show"" did not work.  They tried to compete with the humor in the clips, and it failed, a lot.  I gave it two stars because the criminal content was funny, and with a different format these clips would be worth watching--but they ruined a funny concept with an unfunny format.",1440892800,2,364,4.584615384615384
8684268,1,B00OMCL5NS,It sucks,1440720000,,8,3.5
