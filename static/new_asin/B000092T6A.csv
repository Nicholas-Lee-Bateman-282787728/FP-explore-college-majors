1876844,5,B000092T6A,"George Ratliff has made a gem of documentary in ""Hell House.""  He exposes the scary ignorance of fundamentalist Christians by letting them speak for themselves, while at the same time showing their humanity and that, however misguided, they do care about their fellow human beings and want to save them.  The only objection I could offer is that from what appears in the documentary, the only critics of the Hell House are incoherent raging teenagers, whose objections are skillfully and calmly responded to by a member of the church.  Yet I know from first-hand knowledge that there are critics of fundamentalism (Christian and otherwise) who are capably of equally calm and skilled rational debate.

1876847,4,B000092T6A,"Hell House (George Ratliff, 2001)

Hell House is a documentary, a quick look at the infamous haunted house run every October by a Pentecostal church in Texas. One gets the distinct feeling that the church members had no idea Ratliff was making this documentary to poke fun at them, as earnest as they are.

The best scenes in this are those where Ratliff is using wordless, lingering shots to show how little these people actually know about what they're doing. The funniest thing in the whole movie is one church member describing the ""occult"" scene, which uses a pentagram; actually, it's not a pentagram, it's a Star of David in a circle. (It continues to amaze me no one there, seemingly, knows how to count to five.) Moments like this happen with regularity in the film, if you're paying close enough attention. Most of them are more subtle, but the payoff is just as grand.

For those of you unfamiliar with the increasingly-popular Hell Houses, a quick rundown: a Hell House is a Christian ""haunted house""-type Halloween attraction put on for the purpose of converting the heathen. Everything from the amusing (raves, satanic sacrifice) to the boring (kid commits suicide because his peers are picking on him) to the morally repugnant (at this congregation, at least, AIDS is still strictly a ""gay disease"") is depicted in an attempt to scare the heathen straight and get them to convert. Does it work? This documentary would lead you to believe not, despite the claims of one church member that a number of people converted that month. (Entirely possible; Ratliff couldn't film all the groups being ministered to, of course, and the church (backed up by news reports) claims three thousand coming through per day. Like the old mama said, if you throw enough spaghetti against a wall...

Best watched for the amusement factor, but prepare to be horrified as well. Yes, folks, people still think like Neanderthals in 2001. ****",1052092800,55,1933,4.884146341463414
1876848,4,B000092T6A,"In a time when religious fanaticism has been exoticized and sensationalized in the media as a foreign, invading entity, this is an interesting look at the homegrown variety.  The films director's approach is very subtle; there is no narrative, no outside experts commentating.  All we are presented with is the perspective of the peoples' lives whom are constructing and orchestrating this ""Hell House""--i.e., a redeemed take on the Haunted House theme aimed at gaining new converts.
At the end of the film, I think a genuine understanding and rapport exists between the audience and the 'characters' in the documentary.  Perhaps the most interesting thing about this documentary is that it is about a runaway religious and cultural success that gains tens of thousands of visitors and not a few converts a new church members in the process.  This is truly post-modern religion.",1051747200,6,878,5.161971830985915
1876849,5,B000092T6A,"This is one of the truly great documentaries to have come out in the last few years. It is many things, but most importantly it is a triumph of objectivity. These people are presented as who they are, and they tell their own stories themselves. An absence of any outside narration and very well thought out editing pulls off what is normally next to impossible. As to the subject of the documentary itself, I think a large portion of the people who will be interested in it will most likely not agree with the ideals the subjects hold. I certainly don't, but these people are genuine in their desire to create a better world. Do I think that a better world would be one in which there was no more legal abortions or one that was absent of homosexuality? No, absolutely not, all I'm saying is that these people do care about their fellow man, even if the way they go about trying to help them out would seem backwards to many. These are true and honest people who live their lives in blind faith to a god that many question even the existence of, and all they want is for everyone else to feel as they do. I'm not a religous person per say and I'm pro-choice and have gay friends, I used to promote raves (one of the things hell house has in it's tour), to them I would be considered ""lost"", but I have to say that these people have my upmost respect.

1876853,5,B000092T6A,"This is among my favorite modern day documentaries (science and historical are usually my preference). I watch it every Halloween season for both entertainment value. It is about a haunted house phenomenon, started by Jerry Falwell in the 70s, that expanded into a larger tradition.  The purpose is to scare you into becoming someone who endorses a far right and dangerously depraved interpretation of the Christian faith. It asserts people who engage in unapologetic behavior that includes premarital sexual intercourse, not being Christian, homosexuality, suicide (they have no concept of mental illness), role playing games, drugs, abortion, or pretty much anything the far right condemns, deserves to be set on fire and tortured for eternity. It is their version of Halloween, which is a lot scarier than the one I, and probably you, enjoy with crazy clowns and axe wielding maniacs.  It is scary that these sick people are spreading this message and are probably themselves being harmed by it.

It is fascinating because it shows the lives of seemingly ordinary people, their lives, tragedies, and insecurities, letting them speak for themselves. Many are well intentioned and while I utterly loathe their message (I am an active donor to separation of church and state issues), I feel sympathy for many of them.  They have been brain washed and are trying to advocate something positive.

Warning: I might find it entertaining, its absurdity amusing at times, but it isn't something everybody will enjoy watching because of the theme.  Their views offer the worst conservative Christianity does.",1414713600,,1601,5.258823529411765
1876854,2,B000092T6A,"This presentation is a confusing portrayal.  I can't tell if the film-maker loves or hates the concept.  One might say this is objective, but objectivity does not mean refraining from identifying false information.  For example, the presentation of the ""morning after"" pill is completely unrealistic.  As a conservative Christian, I can say that the ""hell house"" concept does NOT represent the Christian faith, nor the Bible.  The hell house concept is the brain child of those who would form a Christian-type of sharia law.  God want's us voluntarily, not by human legislation.",1394928000,4,578,5.228260869565218
1876855,4,B000092T6A,"When I was a teenager I had an audio tape of evangelist and alleged exorcist Bob Larson visiting hell (or describing the experiences of somebody else who visited hell; I forget which). I lent the tape to a friend of mine, a headbanger who looked the part with his long hair and worn jean jacket with the Iron Maiden backpatch. He listened to it in his bedroom. Lying there in the semi-darkness, listening to the evangelist drone on about the flames of hell and the unimaginable torments of those left to rot there, he quite literally was scared into becoming a Christian.

This kind of fear-based evangelism has long been a staple of evangelical preaching. Most of us have probably read (or at least heard of) Jonathan Edwards famous sermon of the First Great Awakening, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God. The fire and brimstone preacher has long been a staple of North American evangelical piety. And even if such preaching techniques are not now as common as they once were, countless evangelicals still think of evangelism as the selling of fire insurance.

Consider then the 2001 documentary Hell House. The film follows Trinity Church, an Assemblies of God congregation in Cedar Hill, Texas in the year 2000 as it prepares for its tenth year putting on Hell House, a hard hitting evangelistic outreach that files visitors (each paying $7) through several scenes with live actors playing out a series of grisly scenes, each involving a death from things like a botched abortion, AIDS, and suicide. Each scene is framed with a grim theme like drug deal, rave, occult and suicide.

Not surprisingly, the situation of evangelical Christians acting out very grisly scenes provides many moments of deadpan humor. For example, in one scene Mr. Cassar (who comes across as a deeply committed father of several children) is driving his kids to school when he tells his teenage daughter that hed like to try out for the family violence scene. She expresses skepticism saying she finds it hard to picture her dad hitting and stabbing a woman. He agrees, it is a stretch!

Equally amusing moments follow. At one point the pastor asks his workers: Yall need red paint for the pentagram?

During the auditions one young man says hed like to act any part but the drug deal scene because thats the only scene hes acted in the past. He caps off the request with a vote of piety when he says he prays that the Spirit will lead them not to cast him in the drug deal scene!

After his rehearsal one man observes, Im playing the villain so if people are hatin me I did my job. Now I need to leave here and go to church.

At another point a man says: This is Jessica, my girlfriend. Its kind of a neat story. Weve known each other for awhile but last October, uh, she was the, uh, victim in the rave scene and I was the death monitor of the DJ. And what was really neat, for a whole month I claimed her soul to hell and she died under my power. Just shortly after that we got together and everythings been great since.

And to cap it off, on opening night one guy says into his walkie talkie: Hello, Stephen? Would you look around in the control room in the portable and see if there is a knife that the occult people can use to cut the brides throat with?

Just another day at the Trinity Church Assemblies of God!

The evangelistic outreach is definitely fear based and decision based. After the tour through hell groups are led into a room where a man (presumably a pastor or deacon) gives a short evangelistic message. After that a door opens and he invites people to walk through and receive prayer to become Christians. He then begins a countdown from 5. When he reaches 1 the door is closed again. Everything is directed to getting people to make a crisis decision, and over the previous decade the film reports that 15,000 of 75,000 attendees have made such a decision.

Obviously hell house is a well-intentioned effort and a massive undertaking. And the filmmakers seem to be quite sympathetic with the participants, especially Mr. Cassar who is caring for several children  including an epileptic child  since his wife left him for another man. The filmmakers are not interested in presenting caricatures. These are real people and even if one might question their methods, their intentions are good. (Good intentions, eh? But whats that they say about the road to hell itself being paved with such as these?)

Let me make two observations about the limits of hell house. To begin with, it presents a very distorted and limited picture of sin and death. The house includes all the usual suspects for sin: dramatic scenes of people engaged in the occult, drugs, the homosexual lifestyle, abortion. But where are the rooms that depict the sin of failing to aid the poor or the sin of religious hypocrisy? And in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus preached that a person can sin in mind with no external action. So how about a room of a man who is simply sitting serenely on his couch and yet is sinning egregiously in mind? The point was well stated by Harry Blamires in his classic book The Christian Mind:

But the Christian mind cannot accept the facile distinction made by the secular mind  reflected in public society  between the nations criminals and libertines on the one hand and her good men on the other. For the discerning Christian knows that a cunning or intelligent man may lead a life of almost diabolical pride, in which he strives in every moment to minister to the desires and vanities of his own inflated selfand yet may pass for a respectable, law-abiding citizen. Indeed he may rise to a position of eminence in the world by the persistent and subtle practice of the most calculated self-service. He may become a judge, packing off poor men to gaol [jail] with words of stern condemnation ostensibly reflecting the indignation of righteous men, and yet he may be, by virtue of a cancerous inner self-centredness, the greatest sinner, essentially the most evil man, ever to have entered the courtroom in which he sitsthough its dock has accommodated a stream of murders, thieves, and perverts for the last fifty years.  (p. 90, emphasis added)

 So how about a hell house that subverts our comfortable picture of what sin is? How about a hell house that challenges our comfortable notions about who is in and who is out? Blamires made the point effectively by reflecting on Jesus teaching on the sheep and goats:

The Christian mind knows that, in any sorting out of the sheep and the goats, of the virtuous from the sinful, the forces of Heaven would slice through human society at an unexpected angle. The knife would cut firmly, but certainly not horizontally. What can we say or think of how it would separate the self-seekers from the fundamentally God-directed souls, except that it would certainly not leave all the convicts and perverts and public nuisances on one side, and all the cabinet ministers and business executives  on the other? (p. 91)

This brings me to my second point. This woefully incomplete picture of sin and alienation is not only manipulative for its focus on a fear-based quick decision, but it also alienates many people who see through the distorting simplicity of the churchs moralistic framework. This is how one articulate young woman puts it to one of the volunteer workers:

This is why people are so turned off to the Christian religion was that in there. It seemed that they're stereotyping. If you're gay you're going to hell. You make it too cut and dried, too black and white. Theres no grey area. Its like you don't have that grey area and thats what life is.

1876856,1,B000092T6A,"When I requested this movie, I guess I assumed it was like ""Jesus Camp,"" produced by an outside film-maker who was either neutral or actively critical of the Hell House program. But apparently it was done by someone within the church, because the only critical scene was a brief one of a few teenagers who had just been through the program. Their primary complaint seemed to be that a direct consequence was implied to every thing they considered a sin: you're gay, you die of AIDS and go to hell. You go to a rave, you're going to be raped and commit suicide. It's an awfully grim picture they paint.

They were complaining to the guy (I think he is the pastor of the church that put it on, but he may have been one of several ministers) who produced the program that it was unrealistic, only designed to scare people into joining their church. He didn't really disagree, he just thought that was a good thing.

The movie starts in August, when the early planning stages are explained, the actors and actresses, mostly teenagers, are selected. You get to see scenes of the construction of the house, the auditions for the parts, all sorts of things. Interestingly, they are just as interested in how committed the kid is to the church as how good an actor or actress.

The thing is seriously scary, gory, downright disgusting in parts. Then after you've ""gone through hell,"" the last part is a room where a guy says there are people through that door who will pray with you and help you. Or you can stay here and assume you know where you're going when you die. You have ten seconds, and then we will close the door. (He actually counts somewhat slower than that, but it's no more than 20 seconds, I would estimate.)

I have studied propaganda and brainwashing techniques, and I was analyzing the details all through this. The most stark example is at the end, when time pressure to choose is upon you, and the assumption is that those people in the next room who will pray with you are the only way to get to heaven. Presumably you've already bought the idea that heaven and hell are real.

I cannot recommend this movie.",1336953600,4,2123,4.503896103896104
1876857,5,B000092T6A,"Hell House travels to Dallas to examine a Christian fundamentalist church that invites the public to pay $7 to tour an ""exhibit"" that depicts all of the horrors that await those who fail to follow the straight and narrow path - AIDS, suicide, depression, and (of course) Hell. This film is very interesting, regardless of one's beliefs. The scenes of the young children who go through the house - only to find themselves traumatized - are memorable. Also, I found that the Hell House in the film was surprisingly sophisticated; a lot of planning went into all aspects of the production.

I think that the filmmakers do a good job of showing viewers what happens at a Hell House without trying to tell the viewers what to think. Too many of the journalists who comment on the Christian Right spend most of their time condemning fundamentalists. As a result, our understanding of a large segment of the U.S. population is incomplete. Hell House allows you to draw your own conclusions.

My wife and I watched a streaming (online) version of the film. Unfortunately, the video was low quality and it was distracting as we watched.

One aspect of fundamentalism that particularly bothers me is on vivid display in this film. I have noticed that fundamentalist parents tend to push their kids onto the front lines to do the hard work; the parents, meanwhile, do not demand the same sacrifices of themselves. If a ""true"" Christian is supposed to proselytize, then the parents should ""step up"" and do some of the hard work.

1876859,4,B000092T6A,"""Hell House"" is a documentary showing the way that one Assemblies of God church in Texas chooses to teach morality -- by mounting a haunted house that literally shows the wages of sin. The teens and adult leaders of Trinity Church spend a couple of months building sets, holding auditions, making costumes and writing sketches that show how abortion, homosexuality, internet chat rooms, raves, suicide and other aspects of modern life lead to death and to eternal punishment in Hell. This is conservative American Christian morality at its most literal and graphic. No nuances allowed. You accept Jesus or you go to Hell. Period.

The church adults are the odd, plasticky Jesus types who live their lives in a bubble defined by their theology and distrust of the secular world. The kids are kids -- full of youthful energy and enthusiastic about their church and Jesus. Some have been scarred by modern life by rape or the drug scene and hold onto their faith for meaning and support. Many are just regular kids who grew up in a world defined by their church and its teachings.

But churchy or not, every October, the group lets go of Jesus for a walk on the wild side and a chance to portray prostitutes, druggies, killers and drunks. There is some irony in a church that fears the Devil encouraging its young to portray -- in lurid detail -- the sins they should be avoiding. Some folks put a lot of themslves into their work. One young man enjoyed going to raves before his conversion. But his choice of hell-bound debauchery is the rave scene -- which he constructs with loving attention, seting himself up as the demented DJ. A girl who had been raped chooses to play a girl getting raped. Most affectingly, a man whose wife left him for a man she met online is shown watching the very scene that destroyed his life and turned him into a single Dad. This man happens also to be the father of 5 kids -- from about 2 to 16 -- one of whom has cerebral palsy and actually goes into a seizure at the breakfast table. The Dad, already frazzled beyond what anyone should have to bear, calmly holds the kid down with one hand while dialing 911 with the other. Just another day in the life of a struggling disciple of Jesus. His heart is broken on a daily basis, yet he plods on.

While well-meaning, the people who put on Hell House have the kind of unempathic, unloving religious fanaticism that allows them to stage a school attack scene -- complete with shotguns and trenchcoats -- just 6 months after the Columbine shooting. That's just creepy and wrong. The idea that the shooters get dragged to Hell by cackling demons is such a hurtful assault on the parents of the boys involved and is bad theology to boot. Judge not, lest ye be judged. The lone girl who gets taken to Heaven is the one said to have confessed her Christian faith. The rest of the murdered kids get left on the library floor in ambiguous limbo. That's exploitation at its worst.

Hell House is not a terribly well-made film, but its subjects are endlessly fascinating. The extras are OK, best of which is audio of the filmmakers with Ira Glass on ""This American Life.""",1259020800,3,3140,4.552212389380531
1876860,3,B000092T6A,"Hell House is put on by many churches by now.  Supposedly, most of the attendees are bussed in from other churches, so they have an idea what to expect.  But these churches also attempt to attract the ""unsaved;"" unsuspecting persons who believe they are going to see the best haunted house ever, as one of their Halloween activities.  (A friend of mine was one of these people, and he told me his story.)

Aside from the usual hypocrisy and general bs of preachy churches like this, the real SICK here is the blaming of rape and incest victims for those crimes against them, the bleeding-to-death-and-on-her-way-to-hell abortion victim being screamed at by a demon for ""killing her baby,"" and the homosexual dying from AIDS, because in their minds, only homosexuals get AIDS, and they deserve to die.

After the attendees (mostly kids, tweens and teens) go through this sickness, they sit down with ""counselors"" who get them to complete forms wherein they recommit to the faith.

They also have acting awards for the ""actors"" in the production.  It's like Oscars/Prom - they get dressed up, they receive golden awards for best performance, they accept their awards and give acceptance speeches.

Truly insidious and gross is how this one teen girl (a cheerleader) is totally playing the whole system to her advantage. She's the best actress of all, spouting out ""the preach"" like a pro, but one can feel and see her performance - she KNOWS that it's bs, but she is like ""the prettiest whackjob of all.""  She's gaining popularity and power within the system and she's going with it.  This is the kind of atmosphere that raises psycho-power-nuts who end up in politics and as evil ceo's of companies like Halliburton.  These are the women that look the other way while their daughters are being raped by their fathers.

More pathetic might be the father of several young children (and the cheerleader mentioned above) who tossed out the wife for having had an internet affair. OK, she cheated.  But they malign this woman as though she were Satan! The father, who had a very inappropriate moment with his daughter in which he begged for a special cheer for daddy, won custody of all several children.  I can only imagaine what a nightmare the custody battle was for this poor mother.  In most modern societies, a mother has to commit severe crimes against her children to lose custody.  All this woman did was cheat on her husband, and she was metaphorically burned at the stake!  She is nowhere to be found, hence cannot defend herself in this documentary.  She was probably run out of town.

1876861,3,B000092T6A,"Just watched this last night. Quite enlightening, but not in the way the ""Hell House"" perpetrators intended.

This film could be wildly hilarious if it's subjects weren't so pathetically sad in their ignorance and total naivety. It goes a long way in explaining how so many of these people either never leave their pathetic little midwestern towns, or conversely, flee the first chance they get and never look back. They grow up and exist in a self-made bubble, looking out into the world from behind their comfortable lives(relative to many) and see nothing but evil, while never once making any attempt to understand it in any way besides what their equally ignorant evangelical preacher tells them it is. Quite telling how they mistakenly(or not?) draw a star of David in place of a pentagram in one of their sets, or how they blindly judge and instantly dismiss ALL of the ""sins"" they present when they obviously have absolutely no real understanding of the issues at all.

Worse, despite their theologic delusions of righteousness and well-intentioned but ultimately mean-spirited discrimination and persecution, they all seem like genuinely nice, decent people.  Not one of them comes off as malicious or even stupid, just deluded, misled, uninformed and exceptionally close-minded and naive.

The saddest part about these people?  Upon screening the film prior to its release, they genuinely liked it and felt it fairly represented them.  Maybe that's a testament to the filmmakers and their editing choices, or perhaps ignorance IS bliss.

Here we have some decent people in Dallas who take their faith and convictions seriously. Both the adults and teenagers at Trinity Church are the type of people you would love to have as neighbors. They exude goodness, honesty, and sincerity. They are committed to their families, their children, and their faith. I'd trust any of them to keep an eye on my house while I was out of town. And I would go out of my way to help them if they needed me. You won't find any of that post-modern sneering cynicism and moral nihilism that is an indicator of the intellectual and cultural bankruptcy that some Americans want to import from exhausted old Europe. So what did Trinity Church do to earn so much venomous criticism from  so many haters of Christianity? They put on a show about heaven and hell. Being Christian, they believe that some acts earn salvation and some acts earn damnation. Because liberals tend to have no strong moral convictions about much of anything, this is offensive enough to them. To go further and suggest that there may actually be a moral code built into a universe that they see as meaningless only adds to the crime of Trinity Church in their eyes. Throw in some very thinly veiled hatred of Christians (which is the default position in some intellectual, academic, and geographical circles) that would be considered socially taboo if aimed at any other group and you begin to understand why Trinity Church became a target. I like that Trinity put on Hell House and that the members of TC believe in hell. Religion should have some bite - ecstasy needs to be balanced with reverence and fear if it isn't going to be reduced to a self-serving pleasure machine that refuses to deal with the evil possibilities that lie within each of us. Some will complain that Hell House was inappropriate for the young. The same people who make that complaint would be the first to object to any censoring of movies or violent video games. They are probably the same people downloading multi-gigs of porn off the internet. No, it's not realistic violence or the portrayal of disturbing situations that they object to. They love that stuff. The media is full of it. What they don't like is Christians doing it - because it lends emotional power to the message of Christians. They don't like that. They prefer that Christianity be vapid and dull - something that, historically, Christianity has been anything but. Oh, and one more thing: Hell House is voluntary. You have to pay admission to get in. No one is forcing anyone to see the show. There is no more brainwashing here than there is at a Hollywood movie.",1247011200,2,2727,4.645962732919255
1876874,4,B000092T6A,"The level of access the people involved in creating the ultra-fundamentalist ""Hell House"" propaganda tool is extraordinary, and prevents the key players from appearing as simple two-dimensional baddies. These are people with struggles, genuine concerns, and human flaws, and while they take on the task of scaring heathens ""straight"" with a little too much flippant relish, their reasons for doing so appear sincere.

The ultimate impact of watching this fascinating documentary was, for me, to have some sympathy for the Hell House organizers and actors, while still thoroughly deploring their tactics. Terrifying children with images of demons and torment from the Dark Ages is no doubt an effective way of manipulating thought and behavior, but is more coercive than persuasive.

Along with such other documentaries as ""Jesus Camp"" and ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" ""Hell House"" helps raise the level of awareness of how Christianity is actually practiced and understood by real people...something that those defending the religion from criticism by secularists seem to be unaware of. The idealized version of Christianity that its boosters refer exists, and probably is the majority view, but critics are not wrong to point out the zeal and commitment of the minority of believers who embrace a darker, more destructive vision of their faith.",1226448000,2,1340,5.4066985645933014
1876875,3,B000092T6A,"This documentary is boring and extremely depressing. I was falling asleep through 2/3 of it. I had been looking forward to this documentary because the description sounded interesting. The subject itself, the idea itself, was fascinating: Hell House where they showcase real life tragedies instead of ghosts and goblins, all in the spirit of religion?! Why not? I was really to launch my liberal idealistic arguments into a fight with this movie. But, instead, I almost fell asleep and my liberal values went to sleep also.

The documentary is completely unbiased, it simply lays out these people's project and how they come about it (with excessive detail). There documentary does not try to steer you into any direction, which I appreciate, but the excessive detail as to pre-production was too boring. The documentary showed everything from the building of the hell house to auditions (Yay! I am the suicide girl, or I am the abortion girl! ....Sickening) to the through process behind it all. But, finally we get to the end, which was very interesting.

In my own personal opinion, this is a bit wrong. They are carrying out an ultra conservative message from being gay is evil and you will get AIDS, or if you go to a rave, take drugs and get raped, it is all your fault. The liberal in me was a bit upset that they would present a situation in which a young girl, who was raped by her father, and other people at a rave, and obviously not in her right state of mind, will go to hell because she committed suicide. The documentary will make you think, even if you have to suit through the very boring first half.",1213315200,,1617,4.65034965034965
1876876,5,B000092T6A,Really.  There is something wrong with the notion that religion needs a hell or there would be no good reason to go to heaven.  A compelling and objective work.  This DVD is a must see.,1205539200,5,185,4.228571428571429
1876877,4,B000092T6A,"I found this documenary downright fascinating and the only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because there's a limit to how highly I'll rate a documentary that falls into the ""edited together raw footage"" category.

However, this was done about as well as I could have ever expected.  The footage was edited together skillfully in a way that told the story of one group of Christians in a church out there in the Bible best desperately trying to warn young adults about the consequences of certain decisions.

I appreciated the fact that, unlike ""Jesus Camp"", the footage wasn't accompanied by weird ominous music in an attempt to make the viewer think that these people are just a bunch of wingnuts.  If you as a viewer want to think that, fine, but it won't be because you were manipulated into thinking that.

In fact, this docmentary let the subjects tell their own story.  These are real people on a mission to help others.  One may question their tactics, but I won't question their sincerety or their ability to organize and work as a team.  And, a few of them are really quite good actors too!",1193616000,3,1109,4.593908629441624
1876878,5,B000092T6A,"I was expecting the same type of foamy fundy type behavior that was so prevalent in Jesus Camp, but the group in Hell House came across as much more sane and sedate. There was some of the 'speaking in tongues' stuff but I didn't see anyone twitching on the floor (thank goodness), and in their interviews the kids and the adults both came across as thoughtful, bright and passionate without being so over-the-top.

I was particularly impressed by a father we meet about ten minutes into the film. His daughter is trying out for the Hell House abortion scene and we see her and her three other siblings getting ready for school. You immediately sense something is different about this family because instead of mom cooking breakfast and hurrying the children along, their father is doing it. Turns out he and his wife split up because she was seeing someone she met on the internet and he not only has custody of his children, he is raising them by himself. One of the children has epilepsy and goes into a seizure at the table, and this father carries him to a comfortable room and talks (also prays) the little guy out of it while they wait for the ambulance to arrive. It's a very powerful and emotional scene, and this man is so gentle and loving with his children it just really pulls at your heart. Later on the father decides to try out for a scene himself and he and his daughter both end up with good roles.

I've been very outspokenly against the whole concept of spiritually terrorizing kids at Halloween, and I still don't agree with terrifying children for the sake of proselytizing but I have to admit there's a lot of good intentions behind it. I don't think there's a drop of malice or evil intent in these people whatsoever, but I do question the wisdom of allowing children to see some of the scenes because they are so incredibly graphic. People dying of AIDS in a hospital room, a horrific car wreck,  a girl laid out on a hospital bed bleeding to death after a botched abortion. It was so realistic and frightening there's no way I'd ever let my little ones see it.

The two scenes that got to me the most were the hospital scenes involving the AIDS patient and the post-abortion girl. It gives the wrong impression; that it's mainly gay people who get AIDS and it's their own fault. The setting and other aspects of the scene are quite realistically rendered, however, and I can see why people would be terrified by it.

The botched abortion scene is even more graphic. A teen girl is wheeled in on a gurney, her crotch, legs and the bedding under her literally soaked in blood. The set people really know their stuff; it looked frighteningly real. And wet. The artificial blood was pooling under her. Very graphic. The site of it is shocking and intense. The worst part of it that while this girl is lying there crying and screaming in pain there's a rubber-masked, black-robed demon standing behind the bed yelling at her that she's a murderer and she deserves to suffer for killing her baby. I wasn't even there and it got to me, I can only imagine how horrifying this would be to an elementary or middle-school aged child. Scary to some adults, even.

Oddly, no one complained save for a small group of kids who were so upset by the scene involving the gay kid in the hospital they confronted one of the adults. One of them was swearing and flipping the bird while yelling at the man about bigotry. I understood the upset but it could have been handled a bit more diplomatically. That better than any other part of the film showed the emotional and psychological impact the production has on people.

Still, I couldn't help but giggle at their 'occult props', one of which was a black board with what they no doubt thought was a pentagram, which was actually a red star of david painted inside a circle. There was an underlying sense of camp to the Hell House, and I could easily imagine my son and I and I going in and being impressed by the more realistic things, then watching the occult scenes and just laughing our butts off. I mean, arms around each other's shoulders for support, leaning, tears of mirth streaming down our faces, breathless laughter. You get these awful images of bloody bodies, hospitals and tormented people followed by the most poorly informed and campily-staged scenes of satanism and/or witchcraft imaginable. Hilarious!!

I found that while watching the film I experienced a strange mix of emotions ranging from hilarity to horror. It's definitely an objective look at something a lot of us are not involved in and it leaves you emotionally drained, to be sure, but you don't (at least I didn't) get the sense that these people are wackos like the 'Jesus Camp' group. They're sincere and very, very serious about what they're doing. Their passion is inspiring, even if they aren't exactly well-informed. I also liked the noticeable absence of input from the director. He didn't narrate, he didn't make an appearance, he didn't do anything but film what was being done and put up a camera for the individual church members to record their video diaries. The editing was sparse but tight and you get a sense of who these people are without the intrusion of a lot of special effects or negative commentary. I like this approach; it says, 'this is the way things are, take it or leave it'.

Overall it's an excellent documentary, and a fascinating look into a belief system some of us haven't been exposed to, and others among us (like myself) are glad to have left behind. I'm looking forward to watching it again.",1191369600,6,5566,4.602822580645161
1876879,5,B000092T6A,"Every Halloween at the Trinity Church near Dallas, Texas a Pentecostal youth group and their adult leaders build Hell House. The goal of this infamous haunted house is to scare people, especially kids, into turning away from their ""evil"" secular lifestyle and joining the church. Inside Hell House young actors play characters like ""Abortion Girl"", ""Suicide Girl"" and ""Dying Of AIDS Gay Guy"" as examples of the sorts of sins that will send you to eternal suffering and damnation in the fiery pits of Hell.

One aspect of this documentary that I appreciated was it's objectivity. I imagine that the church members insisted that they be allowed to speak for themselves and express their beliefs. The director wisely consented, as I'm sure he realized that the words of these extremists would be more damning than any method of satire or ridicule he could create on his own. And believe me these hellfire and brimstone lunatics don't disappoint in their hypocrisy and absurdity.

I expected to laugh. But my reaction was actually one more of sadness and worry. I have two nephews growing up in a Pentecostal church in Florida that probably is not too different from this one. My nephews are smart kids and hopefully once they become older they will begin to think for themselves and get away from the brainwashing my idiotic ex-sister in law and her ridiculous church is forcing on them.

I also felt bad for the kids in this movie, taught to believe that the world is inherently evil and that the impending return of Christ is their only hope. The violence, bigotry and lies in Hell House were bad enough. But the worse part was the final room where they force everyone to wait before exiting while they try to pressure them into joining the church. Think of the public outcry if some group of Muslim extremists, who have very similar notions of Hell, were to try to gain youthful converts through methods such as this. But I guess if they are Christians it's considered OK.

It's hard to imagine any religous teachings that are further away than these from the essential Christian message of love and mercy. But in Hell House fear and punishment are what it's all about.",1190505600,4,2169,4.76063829787234
1876880,5,B000092T6A,"I quite enjoyed this documentary.  I don't know why I like to watch movies like Hell House and Jesus camp.  I guess I get a little inner laugh at the absurdity of it all.  If you are like me and you have not seen a single shred of evidence to believe in the supernatural including anything from god to chakras, no reason to believe in the afterlife and no reason to think that religions and religious texts are anything but man-made, these movies become a glimpse in to human insanity.  These people are all suffering from a mass, shared delusion.  I can't help but laugh when I see full grown adults, with the cognitive reasoning skills of a ten year old, accepting this crap.  When children are involved, the words ""child abuse"" are not far from my lips.  When I think about these people and people like them voting, raising children and running for office, my voyeuristic grin fades.  I'm beginning to think that, to these people, truth doesn't matter.  I can't admit that they all actually believe this mythology.  I think they need to have sharp black and white rules, the lack of moral ambiguity and the promise of better things to come, in order to cope with their lives.  As a result, they have constructed a reality and placed strong walls around themselves.  Many of the people in the movie, had horrible things happen to them.  By constructing a world, where there is a mysterious figure looking over your shoulder who loves you, who tells you how to live your life, makes it easier to cope.  Does jesus only help those, whom he has done terrible things to?  I am of the opposite viewpoint.  At a young age, I questioned the existence of god but just as importantly, I thought how awful the world would be if religious claims were true.  Would the god of the Hell House church, be something to worship?  Since god is man-made, the particular version of a god that a person creates, tells us a lot about that person.  This movie elucidates a lot about the people involved, through the clumsily vengeful, simplistic and naive god found within.",1187481600,3,2052,4.572602739726028
1876881,2,B000092T6A,"Wanna get the cr@p scared out of you? And I don't mean that in any respectfully horror-ish way when referring to HELL HOUSE. I mean it in a way that'll cause you to doubt human sanity.

Technique-wise, I have to give the creators of this idea a definite thumbs up. Utilizing graphic imagery to frighten people toward God, the Assembly of God Church has accomplished something quite unique every October 31st. Threatening sinners with eternal damnation if they have premarital sex, are gay, or attend a rave party, this church puts on a haunted house filled with gore and violence each Halloween. The actors and actresses are pulled from their congregation annually. Some are young women who dip their crotches in fake blood and scream in mock pain while perched on a makeshift hospital gurney (their dialogue during this horrific scene is centered around ""the morning after pill""and how dangerous it is ...which is completely untrue of course, but we're talking self-induced abortion so this little fib is obviously okay.)

Other scenes include a homosexual man dying of AIDS. A ghoulishly evil creature hovers around him and comments on his ""evil lifestyle choice"" as he groans his last breath and is ushered into everlasting pain and devilish servitude (never mind that the man may have been a pediatrician who cured a type of cancer that saved thousands of lives. Homo? You're goin' to Hell!)

At the end of peoples' tour through these strange Halloween acts, prayer groups are offered up for those who wish to be saved. Never mind that the pressure put on the guests by the aforementioned scenes and the ""limited time"" they have to act on this compulsion are stressed to the maximum (""You have six seconds to walk through that door and be saved by Jesus. One..."")

Probably the biggest downer here is that this is a growing phenomenon. Forget that God is merciful or full of love or wants you to be happy. That's not what this is about. This is all about fear and the tactics used to instill it by a group of individuals who claim to be ""religious."" Excuse me but isn't religion supposed to be about acceptance, caring, and the loving nature of Jesus/God? Maybe I'm missing something.

The other issue is that these Assembly of God members obviously have no idea what Halloween is about nor its history (Note: All Hallows Day - also known as ""All Saints' Day"". The holiday was a day of religious festivities in various northern European Pagan traditions, until Popes Gregory III and Gregory IV moved the old Christian feast of All Saints' Day from May 13 to November 1. In the ninth century, the Church measured the day as starting at sunset, in accordance with the Florentine calendar. Although we now consider All Saints' - or Hallows' - day to be on the day after Halloween, they were, at that time, considered to be the same day.)

The church also shows how suicide is a sin. But God (nor the bible) ever said this (Note: ""In the early Christian era suicide was not only tolerated, but condoned by the church, as a result certain sects such as the Donatists and the Circumcellions jumped off cliffs in great numbers to hasten an afterlife that promised greater rewards than those found on jolly old Earth. Faced with the loss of so many of its members, and rapidly shrinking collection plates, in the sixth century the church decided that anyone else who committed suicide was going to hell."" Bet you won't be hearing that ""biblical history"" during a sermon any time soon.)

There's a brief shining moment when a group of young men and women confront the designers of Hell House and tell them how wrong all of this is (thus my two star rating). But it falls on deaf ears and is quickly swept under the rug in the documentary.",1169942400,6,3733,4.698776758409786
1876882,5,B000092T6A,"I have been critical of the ""Hell House"" movement for years based on their promotional materials, the experiences of colleagues and friends, and a theological revulsion to fear-based evangelism.  This documentary is an excellent and terrifying glimpse into not only the experience offered to ""guests"" (or victims?), but into the personal and spiritual drives that motivate and shape the formation of a Hell House.  The directors are incredibly hands-off, attempting to offer the creators of this institution the chance to tell their story.  This isn't entertainment, but it is very enlightening and a great source for reflection and discussion on issues of tolerance, acceptance, religious diversity, and comparative theologies of evangelism.",1168300800,2,742,5.666666666666667
1876891,5,B000092T6A,Most of the other reviews have summed it up quite nicely. However scenes of cute smiling young teens saying some of the things they say in this film were quite chilling and frightening. It is quite disturbing to see these kids involved in this exercise of FEAR and exclusion of free thought. I find it difficult to express exactly what I'm thinking but basically it is just VERY disturbing and scary. I don't pray in the traditional sense but I pray that some of these kids can some day think and do what THEY truly want to. Amazing!,1163462400,3,533,4.448979591836735
1876892,5,B000092T6A,"In what often feels like a Christian-themed WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, teenage thespians vie for roles as ""the abortion girl"" or ""the date raper"" in the tenth annual Hell House ""Haunted House."" Documenting this yearly collection of social ills and flagrant sins presented by the Trinity Assembly of God in Dallas, Texas, HELL HOUSE provides ample belly laughs coupled with groans of frustration.

Director George Ratliff takes the audience behind the scenes of the tenth annual Hell House, from early brainstorming sessions to ""opening night,"" where Bible-thumping thespians try to save souls via their morality plays. We witness the wild auditions, fact-checking of the script (""Is it 'Magic' or 'The Gathering'?""), and creation of the sets. In between, we catch glimpses of Pentecostal pandemonium wherein prayer sessions are plagued with folks speaking in tongues (""Speaking in tongues is like speaking in French or German,"" says one parishioner), sounding like a Latka Gravis convention.

With material this good, it's difficult to go wrong but HELL HOUSE nearly does. The film remains steadfastly objective throughout. At times, the stone-faced journalism allows the irony to flow freely. However, the muted opinion of the film quiets the outrageousness of these amateur actors as they present crazed scenes of abortions, homosexuality, and suicide. Sure, the scripts to the preachy skits of Hell House sound like they're right out of a Jack Chick comic book but their implications are ominous. While it's not necessary for this film to have a central ""argument,"" HELL HOUSE feels like a lightweight effort for such a heavyweight subject.",1149292800,8,1637,5.365758754863813
1876893,5,B000092T6A,"This is an extremely disturbing but essential movie for any free-thinker or anyone who is disturbed by the current religious right wing.  A ""hell house"" is an extremely clever form of brainwashing teens and stifling dissent. The documentary carefully focusses on how a real horror show is created for Halloween but unlike the usual scary and mindless fun is a full blown sermon that disguises itself as entertainment. The most frightening part of the whole concept of the ""Hellhouse"" is the hatred behind it. The scenario where a teenager is dying of AIDS and another is dying from taking RU-486 while someone dressed as the devil is laughing is sickening as is the re-enaction of Columbine where the teen character being mocked and obviously losing it is portrayed as ""succumbing to Satan"". Some parts of this movie are amusing, in a John Waters-ish kind of way. If these people weren't deadly serious about this quasi-indoctrination, I could pass it off as a laugh.  And the kids who interrupt them and demanding answers are not ""ranters"".  They chose to spoke out. So should anyone who, like the film makers (who let the people speak for themselves, rather than commenting on their own) believes that our young people have the right to make up their own mind about their sexuality, have the right to choose and seek treatment for their mental health issues, rather than believing that they are ""living a life of sin"".",1138060800,12,1420,4.859504132231405
1876894,3,B000092T6A,"I came across this movie in a sort of odd way. It was pretty much thrust in my face at a used movie store. When I was flipping through dvd's this man went out of his way to just start talking to me in a very animated manner, telling me,""Oh this movie is so scary. Have you seen it? I can't watch it, it is so scary, etc."" Since I love horor movies I took it. Although I prefer strangers not start gabbing with me.

My friend and I read the back and I said it's born-again christian propaganda. My friend replied, let's watch it so we can laugh. The man, who moments before was so animated, suddenly became sullen and quickly walked away. Hmmm, me thinks he was a christian and was trying inadvertantly to spread the word to me through this movie. That I better turn or burn, which brings me to the movie.

It was very interesting and sad. Sad that in this day and age people are still so blinded by the light, which is their own business of course, except that the message they spread is so poisonous. There is nothing beautiful about many aspects of religion or christanity. Watching this movie only reinforces this fact.

Watching these teens and adults trying to convert people by gross examples shown in the ""haunted house"" was sickening. Scaring someone into not drinking and driving was fine, so is scaring someone into not having to get an abortion. Abortion is terrible, but it's a necessary evil. But showing a ""deserving"" ""homo"" dying of aids on his way to hell was so terrible it bordered on being a hate crime.

But the worst thing of all was the christian teens, who aren't allowed to have a mind of their own because the so called christian adults keep pounding into their head about hell, which of course doesn't exist! But if you make someone believe it you can have all sorts of sick control over them.

Making a child believe in hell, demons, the devil, etc, borders on child abuse. And we the viewers are hit over the head with it every five seconds. I don't think these people want to save souls so much as they are control freaks, who can't rest until they convert as many people into their religion as possible. It's as if they are saying, you are only spinning your wheels until you become saved. ""Like them"".

It's arrogant and so negative. There are many many issues going on with these people. And it all seemed so sad and pitiful in a way. All these folks who are in an abusive relationship with a God, who they have to love at gunpoint. Love me and give your total will to me or else. How can you love a God like that? If a human being expected the same thing we'd call him an egotistical tyrant.

But in this movie it isn't even considered. It's a given and no one questions it. Eternity is a long time to suffer in torment. Gee, God and his middle man really want their pound of flesh... So in closing this was a real life horror movie. A documentary that clearly shows one of the main reasons the world is such a mess and will continue to be. People, who in their own freshly scrubbed all-American way promote hatred, bigotry and homophobia, yet they don't even know it, or even care. That's what makes them so dangerous.

If there is a God and he is in fact so without ego and so loving, he must want the best for us even if we don't believe in him. Only then is he a truly fair and loving selfless God. Sorry if I stepped up on my soap box a moment, but watching a movie like this makes you want to. It leaves you no choice if you are a person, who lives in reality and truly cares about other fellow human beings.",1130371200,9,3547,4.275707898658719
1876895,1,B000092T6A,"I am a christian, and I have been to hellhouse several times. I even know alot of the people who participate in the acting. When a person makes a documentary they do it to form their own opinions. They are only going to show you what they want. It's called editing. Most of the scenes in the film are controversial because George Ratliff does not show you what he really taped while filming these scenes at Trinity in Cedar Hill. (Star of David mistake,The angry kids which by the way that was the only group he could find in all the days he was at the church taping, and on the very last day! etc.,etc.).He doesn't show you the kids who come out truly touched because they could be in a similar situation. It frustrates me how people get so angry when they see the hellhouse movie, but they can watch horror movies. I mean really grotesque images!! Without even a second thought. Then, I have to realize that when you become so hateful over what we believe in, that it is conviction and that's why you respond in that way. They do not force you at the end to join the church, they simply let you know that if you want someone to pray with or talk to, counselors are available in the next room. Try going and seeing it for yourself before you judge a very poorly done documentary. They care about people, our youth is blinded today, and they want to reach out to the ones who are hurting and could be in these situations. You love the person, not the sins. That is what hellhouse is really about.",1126915200,9,1496,4.308510638297872
1876896,4,B000092T6A,"I saw this movie and it struck home with me. Mainly because I used to think that way. I used to be a Christian, and here was how I thought about life: ""We are in a war. The battle is being fought over souls. We must win this war at any cost. Fear is a good thing, because the important thing is that people come to Jesus. It doesn't matter how.""

However, this doesn't hold up. Faith based on fear is no faith at all no matter what Christians say. Emotional intimidation and bullying are characteristics of cults. I respect Christians who do not use scare tactics to share the Gospel. But I question why they believe in any of it at all.

The subject of Hell House is Hell. I do not understand why the concept is so important to Christians. What sin has any person commited that would warrant them spending an ETERNITY being tortured forever? What sin deserves such punishment? Even the worst child molester will have been punished enough after a thousand years or so. But eternity? Why is this an acceptable belief system for Christians? If a person tortured somebody, they would feel shocked. But when God does it, it is okay.

The Christian god is an unjust god. They can argue that god doesn't send people to hell; they send themselves to hell. But god created the torture chamber. The creator of the torture chamber is no better than the one who sends people there.

Really thinking about HELL for the first time in my life is what made me leave Christianity after 28 years. Hell is so wrong and immoral that I could never believe in a god who would create such a thing. I am now an Atheist, and proud of it. I watched this DVD shortly after I left Christianity. It is certainly thought-provoking. But mostly it is just sad. Over and over, I could see the brain-washing and the lies that I myself used to believe also. I could see the silliness and absurdity of the entire message. I can't believe that that used to be me.

For you Christians out there, this movie is completely objective. To his credit, the producer imposes no opinions, and lets Christians have their complete say. Christians get the last word in this movie, and unbelievers are shown to be inarticulate at best.

This was filmed in Cedar Hill, Texas. I used to live not far from there, and actually attended that church for some time while I was in college. So I recognized a few of the people in this movie. That youth pastor is a total jerk. It is obvious from the movie. It is his way or the highway. He could learn a thing or two from the Bible about submission and love.

The ignorance of some (not all) of the people in this movie is astounding. Hearing them talking about Goosebumps and Magic: The Gathering was amazing. They actually know absolutely nothing about these subjects, yet they condemn them and talk like those things will turn you into a Satanist. That stereotype is a typical example of Christian bigotry and stupidity. Have they ever actually read Goosebumps even once in their life? Have they ever played Magic: The Gathering or met anyone who has? Some Christians are so naive that they really will believe anything they are told. That one scene demonstrated that very effectively.

I also found this movie to be sad. I really felt for the guy with the epileptic son. My heart moved for him. And I cringed when I heard him talking about his wife leaving him because of her sin. No wonder people find comfort in religion. It is much easier to say, ""My wife left me because she is a sinner and I'm a Christian,"" rather than, ""My wife left me because our marriage was screwed up."" But I still felt for the man. I also felt angry that he is trapped in the defeatest position that the church puts you in, where you are a victim who cannot change your situation except through prayer. And you've got to put up with all that kind of crap in your life ""out of love"".

The quality of this movie is excellent. I especially liked the background music and the ""demons"" deleted scene. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 only because I wish that he had left in the Satanic Sacrifice scene. The producer probably thought that would be a little too grisly and over-the-top even for this movie. But hey, that came from the mind of Christians and no one else.

One final word here. I hope Christians will watch this movie and really think about what their church and what their Bible is telling them. I do not think that Christians truly believe in hell, or they would live their life quite differently. If they truly believed in hell, then every ounce of their spare time, energy, and money would be spent in trying to convert and save souls. How can one Christian's life compare to an entire eternity of one unbeliever suffering? Even if a Christian sacrifices his entire existence witnessing, it is worth it to save just one soul. Anything less is hypocritical.

Christians file Hell into that part of the brain labeled ""Do Not Think."" I am convinced that Christians do not truly believe in hell. If Christians truly believed in hell, then they would not live the lives of luxury that they enjoy in America today. Thanks for reading this review.

P.S. I watched this movie one time and now I'm selling it. Let Christians spend their lives worrying about the afterlife; I'm going to spend my life actually LIVING.",1124323200,10,5293,4.490644490644491
1876897,4,B000092T6A,"I spent ten years working various scenes at the Trinity Church Hellhouse.  Yes, it is a bit campy, and yes, it is often over the top, but I can say that the people are well intentioned, just a bit off target.  I attended Trinity Church from birth until I was 22 years old.  I do not attend their anymore because of the close-minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary.  I stopped doing HellHouse when they added the decision room my last year.  I just felt it was an un-biblical  scare tactic.  I now feel that way about the entire operation.  The worst feeling I get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves.  I know because I was once one of them.  I have found that a growing number of former Trinity Youth Group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons I listed above.  This movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist Christian Churches.",1104278400,73,973,4.5344827586206895
1876898,5,B000092T6A,"This is a fascinating look at the evangelical world of black and white, good and evil. With no tolerance, or room for ambiguity in their thoughts, the ""folks"" at Trinity Church explain all the of life's complexities with one simple creed, it's the work of the devil. One simple-minded soul explains, ""this is the worst the world has ever been."" Apparently the poor dear has never heard of the plague, witch trials, or other tortured times when the religion ruled the world.  I suppose they didn't teach those things at the Trinity school. The most frightening part of this documentary is when young children, after being subjected to scenes that relentlessly hammer them with violent images, are psychologically coerced into going through a door ""where there are people waiting to pray with you"", or re-enter the secular world and risk damnation. As a psychotherapist, (another thing that evangelicals believe are of the devil) I can now fully understand why the majority of my most impaired clients come from fundamentalist backgrounds. Allowing young children to go through a Hell House is nothing short of child abuse, and at the very least Christian extortion.",1078012800,26,1164,5.0625
1876899,4,B000092T6A,"The documentary certainly looks down on the subjects. The rave guy who acts like he knows so much, actually is so clueless he doesnt know the name of the date rape drug. The research by the members of the church is horrible. The film is gritty (both in subject and lighting) and some scenes had no relevence (dating & football matches?) Watching the film a few things popped into my mind 1) where is the scene with the abortion doctor murderer. 2)I hope none of the people ever get raped or depressed. Arogance at it's best",1073001600,3,523,4.458333333333333
1876900,2,B000092T6A,"I have noticed from these other reviews that although they may disagree on the world-view of these fundamentalist protestants, this documentary is fascinating. Actually, I have found it quite dull.
Most of this film takes place during the creation of Hell House, featuring its construction, the research (or what they think passes for research), and auditions of the actors. Peppered throughout this tedium are some anectdotes concerning the faith of these people, including church meetings where they sing, dance and babble. (Or as they call it, ""speaking in tongues"").
The presentation made me feel like I was waiting for this haunted house to begin already. When opening night finally arrived, what I got was a campy, poorly acted freak show on how a sadistic God will torment forever anyone that so much makes a mistake in their lives.
My personal feelings aside, I gave this film two stars on account that the premise is interesting; the idea of building a haunted house that scares people into accepting Jesus. Also, the filmakers did a good job in remaining neutral and allowing us to draw our own conclusions about the doings of this Pentacostal church.
So if you don't mind seeing a bunch of christian rubes waving their arms and jumping up and down like monkeys, then by all means see it.",1064707200,3,1298,4.904545454545454
7988587,5,B000092T6A,"Though this documentary was released in 2003, the Christian brainwashing of highly impressionable children and lesser intelligent adults continues to this day, and the ridiculous ""message"" of the church in charge of the titular Hell House puts that well into perspective. Even in the age of internet where global education is at its highest ever point, the desperate Christian movement continues in small towns and third world countries, leading the less fortunate down the trail of control. The camera work was extremely amusing, as I got the impression multiple times a sort of sarcastic and/or deadpan humor as they panned over certain subjects (for instance, a ""pentagram"" spray-painted with a Jewish star instead of a regular 5-pointed star, for some strange reason...) or hovered on silent interviewees during very awkward moments (or my favorite scene where a small group of reasonable young adults tried in vain to talk empathetic sense into the blindly ignorant pastor, before simply giving up and walking away). I particularly enjoyed the part where the guy at the end blatantly claimed the traumatic skits were not scare tactics, when they so clearly were, then went on to challenge the poor, newly susceptible victims to walk through the exit before thinking twice about their religion.

If you make it a habit to research religion and other such topics online and already know about all these underhanded tactics the church pulls to drag people under its umbrella of forced worship, then I highly recommend this documentary. You'll find yourself laughing more often than not, and the ""graphic"" scenes are fairly amusing as well (though underwhelming if you're a fan of gore or effed up topics). I really enjoyed myself watching this and appreciate that it's available on Amazon.",1520467200,,1791,5.175862068965517

I don't really get why a church would have hunted house made of sins. Just my opinion. Have a safe carnival or a trunk and treat..but to each there own,1483315200,,288,4.5576923076923075

7988591,4,B000092T6A,"You start out really disliking these evangelical Christians,  but then a magical thing happens. You see them as human beings on a quest for happiness, same as you. Same as me. No, I don't like their politics. I don't share many of their conservative values, but when you see John Cassar lay his hands on his three year old son, praying to God, and that child comes out of his seizure, your heart changes. I show that clip in my religion classes every semester. This film truly changed my judgment of these conservative Christians and broadened my perspective on religious pluralism.

The documentary is well done. We see private interviews, behind the scenes footage of the actual building of the Hell House, in depth personal stories, and a truly impressive look at people with heart-felt values, both on the conservative and liberal ends of the spectrum.

I liked this film much better than Jesus Camp. Hell House is a touching documentary that leads us to that precious place of open-ended feelings about people we may have had an unfair bias against prior to viewing it.",1476403200,2,1074,4.794594594594595

7988593,2,B000092T6A,"If their fear-mongering tactics had been accurate to a single degree, then perhaps this might be worth watching. The utter ignorance of these people and the concepts they're trying to portray is just plain sad. Tf kind of DJ doesn't know the name of a single date rape drug, colloquial or scientific? Is he for real? I totally agree with the reviewer criticizing their portrayal of the anti-abortion pill, because that crap was just ridiculous. And Magic: The Gathering leading to occult practices? Lol! Still the best part (well worst really), is 30:18 where they pan over the construction for the occult scene. 666 is painted in red spray paint followed by a STAR OF DAVID rather than an actual pentagram! This shining example of ignorance and sheer stupidity really says everything you need to know about the accuracy of their portrayals, or lack there of that is.",1468713600,,867,4.864864864864865

7988595,4,B000092T6A,"It's the same documentary style as Jesus Camp- they show this Hell House from start to finish, with no commentary about how good or bad it is. You're allowed to form your own opinion on it. And while I think everyone will have the same opinion- that these people are terrifying and they are preaching a horrible message to young people- it's nice that I get to make that opinion for myself watching it. Warning to all fellow pro-choicers, LGBTQ family, anyone who relates to anything that the radical Christian church would deem a ""sin""- this move will infuriate you. Otherwise, it's fascinating.",1445558400,2,596,4.796116504854369
