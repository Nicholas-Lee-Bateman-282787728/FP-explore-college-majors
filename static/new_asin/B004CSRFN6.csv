I've read on the subject, but it helps tremendously to watch someone do it. I also like the fact that they have several sub-menus where you can explore two different ways to your brewing. Also they really explain kegging and bottling. Definitely a great one to have in your collection of education material on the subject of home brewing",1430784000,,509,4.730337078651686
