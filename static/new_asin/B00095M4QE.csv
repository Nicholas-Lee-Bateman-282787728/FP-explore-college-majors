I started few days ago with this DVD and must say, I learn a lot by viewing the first lessons, Nick explain his lessons very clear and easy to follow (this is great to learn) after viewing the first lessons I start LW and make few test with a simple groundplane and few ball, I must say Nick gives me a lot of hints in his lessons to become great lighting results!",1121904000,2,465,4.0

It does a wonderful job of explaining what each light does, how it creates shadows and when and why to use them.

If you're more experienced lightwave user, it will confirm or correct your lighting schemes.  And make you a much better texture artist.

Then if you add up all of the bonus content available from the website, this DVD is an excellent value.

I just wish that what a little more in-depth with UV mapping and some of the other higher-end texturing techniques.

and a lack of information on creating atmospherics.  Important to remember this is an introduction.

Hopefully they'll make advanced lighting and shading DVD of the same quality",1120262400,3,750,4.7153846153846155
8057412,5,B00095M4QE,"THIS IS AN AWESOME DVD.  If you want to learn lighting and shading from the most basic concepts, you must have it!  I can't recommend it enogh

I use the techniques every day now.",1117670400,,179,4.205882352941177
8057413,3,B00095M4QE,This DVD is great for a person who knows nothing about lighting in 3D. If you want to learn lighting for a scene or lighting an envirormant your better off getting a book on it. I was disapointed w/ this DVD.,1116892800,,208,4.097560975609756
8057414,5,B00095M4QE,"I really loved this DVD, I use the technics in all my projects now, it is a tool for everyone. At first, you`ll see things that you already now, but right at the beginning you`ll see that he introduces you to a new way of lighting your scenes, managing shadows and most of all, how to balance your scene, for me it was excellent!

I trully recomend this to everyone who want to make photoreal images from Lightwave, and I daresay that you can use the knowledge of this to every 3d rendering system.",1116892800,3,499,4.308510638297872
