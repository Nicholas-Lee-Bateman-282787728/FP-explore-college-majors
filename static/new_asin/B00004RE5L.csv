1343396,5,B00004RE5L,"I bought the Silver Foxes back in 1988 and always loved it. I have recommended it to many others also. My husband threw it away totally by mistake. The music, everything is perfect and I enjoy exercising with him as well as his adorable mother, and the famous actors parents. The thing I like so much is I can do it and all the way through. I have never been bored with it.  Even when I am traveling I do the arms exercises. I just plain love it! So, I am ordering it today.",1026000000,31,474,4.042553191489362
1343397,4,B00004RE5L,"I just went through surgery related to breast cancer and ""discovered"" this videotape.  It has been a perfect way to work on my fitness without the jarring associated with many aerobics tapes and the stretches are do-able even with my stitches. I get a safe workout.",1015200000,28,265,4.760869565217392
1343398,5,B00004RE5L,"I have lots of Richard's other exercise videos, and they are all great, I've been using them for years.  Now that I am a little older and have arthritis in my hips and knees, I found this to be a very gentle yet effective exercise routine.  I love it!",1412294400,,251,4.1020408163265305

1343401,5,B00004RE5L,"This low impact aerobic exercise tape is just what I was looking for.  After being in the hospital for breathing problems, this is just what I need to get me back on track and breath.ing better. It is not so long that you give up.  You also do not need a lot of room",1391385600,,266,3.9074074074074074
1343402,5,B00004RE5L,I had it put on a DVD and use that all the time. It cost me quit a bit to have that done but I do use it. Very good for older people.,1391126400,,133,3.0606060606060606
1343403,5,B00004RE5L,It is not as clear as it should be but it is an old tape.  I have been exercising to it over ten years.,1377820800,,103,3.2916666666666665
1343404,5,B00004RE5L,"I know the tape -- it's excellent for our senior weights class -- and my personal copy in VHS format wore our.

The replacement from Stormy_Weather_Books has yet to arrive, over a month later.

Disappointed",1376438400,,206,4.857142857142857
1343405,5,B00004RE5L,"It's a fun way to get in both aerobic and cardio exercise without putting too much strain on your joints, but be warned... if you have had knee or hip replacement, it can cause much discomfort a few hours after doing the workouts unless you've faithfully done the exercises recommended by your physical therapist.  (Also, check with your orthopedist to get his/her okay first.)  Even though this is a low impact routine, you get a great cardio workout here, so prepare to sweat.

You'll do a lot of swaying side-to-side with this video (part of what makes it fun), but your knees need to be strong so that particular movement doesn't cause the pain.

Richard is calmer here and I prefer him this way than the more ""manic"" personality he shows on most of his other exercise workouts.

I could find this only in the VCR format and the price I paid for a tape made me flinch a bit at first, but it was worth it.  Although the colors have faded some in the tape (filmed in '85 or '86, I believe) there is no jerking or skipping on the video I received, so I'm very pleased with my purchase.  It's actually in very good condition.

I'm very pleased with the supplier.  It came much sooner than I'd expected and was carefully packaged to prevent any damage in shipping.  Good for them!

Overall, I enjoy (and, therefore, use) this routine more than any of my others simply because it accomplishes what I'm trying to do in a fun, effective way.

Do yourself a favor and splurge on the ""Silver Foxes"".  Also, if you find it available anywhere on DVD, LET ME KNOW!",1375747200,,1555,4.4522968197879855

Too bad the dvd is so expensive, but this works for all of us.",1372032000,,132,3.75
1343407,5,B00004RE5L,"As promised, low impact, no stress exercises.  It's easy to do yet a good work out.  I highly recommend it.",1368489600,,107,4.3
1343408,5,B00004RE5L,"This is a program I started participating in 3 times a week in my community.  I purchased it so that I could do it at home more often, without having to travel 8 miles.  I like the convenience.  It helps me keep the variety going, as I do this along with various walking programs",1361145600,,279,4.12962962962963

1343410,4,B00004RE5L,I know this is a very old video but I love using it as I am 77 years old and not able to use those harder ones.  I purchased this one to give to my best friend as she is elderly also.  I have had the first one for many years.,1346976000,,225,3.392156862745098

1343414,5,B00004RE5L,"This ""out of print"" video is so good, I bought an (unopened yet) backup from Amazon in case my original breaks.  I HATE to exercise and this is the only regimen I've ever been able to get myself to do. I've used it for many years.  I'd say it's not for gym hounds but great for anyone else.  It's only as taxing as you yourself decide to make it,  you feel really good when you do it; also it isn't boring, and can be done in limited space-- about 5 or 6 feet.  If  you're old enough for AARP to start flooding your mailbox--or even older than THAT-- I heartily recommend this.",1233964800,8,577,4.107142857142857
1343415,5,B00004RE5L,A great exercise tape for those of us with silver tresses!  Not too stressful but enough to get the blood flowing and the heart pumping.,1227398400,2,136,4.44
1343416,5,B00004RE5L,"If you think this exercise for seniors requires you to be half dead, think again.  Simmons takes several ""celebrity-parents"" seniors through a very low impact workout.  You will ""move"" here to nice mellow music and workout in an attractive setting.  The highlight is his encouragement to tone and become flexible during a sit-down regime.

Again, this is a low impact, but if one is conditioned, you can increase the activity.  Excellent workout for seniors whether you are beginning or advanced.  Take it at your own pace.  .....Rizzo",1041724800,36,535,5.080459770114943

7921203,5,B00004RE5L,"Perfect exercise for this over 60s couple. Good for the unathletic and the athletic person as well. Easy to follow.
Nice music: not boring and not overbearing... sort of dance-band 1950s stuff (?) y'know: with the saxophones and trumpets.
Richard is always the best cheerleader encourager motivator and clearly communicating teacher.",1487376000,,333,5.549019607843137
