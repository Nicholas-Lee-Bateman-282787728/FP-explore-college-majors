3053463,5,B0010X8NKU,Good movie pack.,1485820800,,16,4.666666666666667
3053464,5,B0010X8NKU,Future Trunks and Bardok both suffer terribly so expect tragedies on both movies.,1483574400,,81,5.3076923076923075
3053465,3,B0010X8NKU,"So the main reason I got this (and basically started with this Bluray) was because the old DVD's are becoming more and more difficult to find. Last time I tried getting one of the DVD's I tried going with one of the more rarer ones being the Coolers Revenge, and Return of Cooler. First one I got had skipping problems and audio problems had to send it back. The next one I got was really expensive and still in it's wrapping. But trying to find others was getting more and more difficult. I also liked the metal tins they are in. But because of the rarity and wanting a complete set I started looking around. I was going to go with the brand new collection they have these days offering many of the movies on a few complete discs.

After researching a bit I realized they were missing some at least, such as this set of movies. So I then decided to go with the blurays and hopefully get them. Well I was on the fence for a while because of the fact most of the blurays were pretty pricey in the past and they are still in a way considering they are around 20 dollars. For some people that might not be much, but when you start buying up all of them it starts to add up. Plus the fact is, the newer movies that have come out like Freeza coming back in one of the newer movies won't be in this collection.

But I figured why not. After getting the Bluray and watching it through I was kinda let down. They are good, but at the same time they are missing some stuff. I remember these movies from when they were on tv in the past and almost everything is the same, the few differences such as it's cleaned up is nice. The music is different, and im not talking about the Japanese to English version. When this was on tv in the past they used a lot of the same music, however they also had some of Bruce Faulconers music in there as well at least in the credits. I know a lot of DBZ fans dislike his music, and others enjoy it. I grew up with it and I enjoyed it so the lack of it and thus it being replaced by some crapy rock band song is kinda annoying.

I wasn't to excited spending a bunch of money to have a collection of all these movies to go with my complete DB, DBZ, DBGT DVD series (which is now going to be wonky because of DB super). But just less incentive for me to go with the rest of them since Fundianimation obviously changed out the music because of the dispute they had with Faulconers music or whatever happened. The other thing is there are no extras at all except for trailers for a game, and animes (the standard fare but you would think after this long they would have added some stuff with this Bluray release).

Idk others might like it but I am still on the fence about it. I was hopping for some nostalgia and part of it was missing because of the lack of Faulconers music.",1482192000,4,2798,4.128440366972477

It was well packaged and the steelbook feel is very welcome.

Of the two, History of Trunks is my most favorite.  You can see the devastation and fear that the Androids have created and what drives Future Trunks to rewrite history and avenge his friend and mentor Gohan.

The current Dragonball Super includes an arc that builds on Future Trunks after Cell saga, which is kind of interesting.",1470960000,,439,4.589743589743589

3053486,3,B0010X8NKU,I'm a diehard Dragonball Z fan and I am collecting every single movie for season one Blu-ray but I was very disappointed with this DVD it's sucked and it was so short yes it showed me stuff that I didn't know and gave me information on some of the Dragonball episodes and stuff I didn't actually know about but the Bardock one was way too short and the trunks ending was ridiculous there was nothing to it way too short,1465257600,,419,4.25
3053487,3,B0010X8NKU,"I love DBZ I own both of the movies on this blu ray on DVD. If you're considering buying this do yourself a favor and buy them on dvd, I bet you can find them cheaper. I say this because I just watched the blu ray and dvds back to back to see how it compared. The dvd version is a straight through movie, while the blu ray has 15 second intermissions/interruptions with DBZ art (kinda like the commercial breaks in tv shows) at some pretty intense moments in the movie.  These breaks are throughout both movies on the blu ray. I have a 50 inch HD tv and it was pretty easy to notice a scratch in the digital transfer in Bardoc offset from the middle to the right as well. it was there for about 5 minutes a fine black line that twitched then gone.
As far as the movies go they are exactly the same, remastered (video slight improvement), with the option of either original Japanese or US audio. Honestly the 4 or 5 breaks in it is the deal breaker for me but for you is up to you. I want to give this a 5/5 review but the breaks killed it
This is a great filler but since I take good care of my dvds when I want to watch either of these I will always go with dvd. I have been phasing out my collection buying blu ray and giving away repeat dvds however I will keep these. I have been collecting all the dbz double features and so far I have only been truly happy with 13/bojack but I am still missing cooler, broly, and wrath of the dragon",1463788800,3,1439,4.031468531468532
3053488,4,B0010X8NKU,"I was hoping to replace my VHS version because The History of Trunks is my favorite DBZ feature ever.
It is the uncut version (which I haven't seen before), containing a few extra snippets which could be considered less family-friendly.
Overall it's fine, but some unnecessary changes bothered me.

=================

AUDIO:
Includes options to select preferred audio setting: DOLBY TrueHD English 5.1 w/Japanese Audio; DOLBY Digital: English 2.0 with U.S. Music; and Original Japanese.

***Personally I like the Dream Theater stuff (U.S. Music) in The History of Trunks. The thing I did not like was the transition to the End Credits, sadly the music makes a hard switch from ""Through Her Eyes"" to some generic DBZ music which kills the mood, unlike the the VHS version.

=================

VIDEO:
Looks great, there is noise grain, but I got used to it after a while.

The aspect ratio is adjusted to fill the 16:9 screen format which cuts off the top/bottom sections of the animation to attain this; really not missing much but I would have preferred an option to switch to 4:3.

***The History of Trunks movie contains the bumpers for commercial breaks (again unlike the the VHS version), these have kiddie music and show baby Trunks and Gohan making faces. Some of these bumpers are at key moments in the story and destroy the tone it sets.

=================

Aside from me being picky about a few things, it's worth seeing if you haven't already. I just prefer the VHS version, but it is still the best DBZ movie in my opinion.",1463529600,9,1534,4.846743295019157

3053496,3,B0010X8NKU,"Just purchased this item, I had to go with the blu ray because the DVD version seems to be out of print or something, which is completely lame.  I know these movies/tv specials are awesome I have watched them both numerous time but I have never owned them.  But I have been collecting all of Dragon Ball Z and these last movies are the last of the official stuff to complete my collection.  I give this item 3 stars not because of packaging or the movies themselves but solely because I feel I am being in a way coerced into going with the blu ray format strictly because that is the only item that is sold directly from Amazon as well as because the DVD is out of print, the DVD version is almost double the price to buy it...USED.  Really kind of bummed because the rest of my collection is DVD because I can pretty much play that anywhere, the blu ray format really dwindles down the devices I can watch it on....Still really looking forward to completing my collecting with these movies though.

Update:  Just for reference, although I enjoy the blu ray main menus on the blu rays, I am so disappointed by the blu ray picture on these films.  It's basically DVD quality...just so you know if you purchase this product.",1456185600,,1222,4.404444444444445

""Unless you're upgrading it from VHS then don't worry about buying a blu-ray version if you already have the DVD.

Having watched the original DragonballZ on DVDs and despite their best attempts at restoring the original films, the blu-ray version doesn't seem to offer any real advantage to the DVD versions.

You will still notice the film grain throughout the film.
Another issue is given that the original version was made for 4:3 the up scaling to 16:9 didn't really do anything for the film and feels like a cropped/stretched version of the original.""

Something I'll add to this review that I didn't mention in the other is as with the picture quality the audio does sound better, but like the picture quality it really isn't that noticeable.",1322179200,10,1214,5.759776536312849

Not only that, but the video quality in the History of Trunks is just terrible.  I'd honestly say that even the orange brick box sets for the seasons of the TV show look dramatically better.  It really doesn't look or sound very good at all.  Other then all the technical stuff it's all still there, and as great as it has ever been.  Both movies are still as awesome as they always have been, but the serious and obvious lack of effort by Funimation (or whoever was in charge of this particular conversion) is very upsetting.",1279065600,2,677,4.419354838709677

The great part about it that makes up for those small mishaps are that these two stories are some of the best ever told.

When the explanation of how the Broly movie was transferred to HD came on, it compared the new footage to the original Japanese footage, and the original Footage looked better.

3053593,4,B0010X8NKU,"I can remember when ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" was shown on TV in Japan back in 1993 the buzz on the anime BBS at the time was just message after message of excitement and shock by ""DRAGON BALL Z"" fans.  That excitement was followed by the large attended screenings at anime fan clubs for ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"", the second special of ""DRAGON BALL Z"".  Seeing the shocked faces of everyone who watched it will always be a lasting memory and this special would become a favorite of mine.

Now nearly two decades later, the first two specials have been released together on Blu-ray Disc courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

VIDEO:

If there is one thing that is important to remind everyone is that these two animated specials are twenty years old.  It's a general known fact that a lot of older anime films, specials and even TV series have not been preserved well.  There is only so much that can be done with the original master source, so let's start with the good and the bad.  The good is that this is probably the best we are ever going to see ""Dragon Ball Z"".  It's on Blu-ray, hi-def and the picture quality was great for that time and the colors are nice and sharp with it's 1080p transfer.  The video was remastered in High Definition and digitally restored and you get a nice wide screen 169 transfer.  Colors look good for two anime films that are twenty years old.

With that being said, the good news is that the specials fared quite well in its translation to Blu-ray.  Because these two were shown on television, you don't get as much scratches or dust.  In fact, I saw very little of any scratches or dust which was great considering how old these two specials were.  Also, the colors were quite vibrant and was very pleased with the video transfer.

AUDIO:

Like the treatment they have given to their TV season box sets of ""DRAGON BALL Z"", this Blu-ray disc features Dolby TrueHD, English 5.1 with Japanese or U.S. Music and the original 2.0 Japanese track.  I love having been given the choice and although I grew up watching ""DRAGON BALL Z"" with its original Japanese language, I have to say that the English dubbing for the US ""DRAGON BALL Z"" is terrific and perfectly cast.

The Dolby TrueHD English 5.1 track is where you are going to hear the difference because of the utilization of the rear channels during the battle scenes.  So, it's great to have FUNimation really work the 5.1 track for the Blu-ray release.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Surprisingly there are no special features included on the Blu-ray but there are a good number trailers for a lot of the recent FUNimation DVD and Blu-ray releases.

I may sound a bit biased towards these two specials because I was there to see the excitement by anime fans not long after the special was shown in Japan and to see the anime club viewings in the US so packed with people watching it in Japanese (without understanding what is going on) and to see anime BBS message boards with long threads from ""DRAGON BALL Z"" fans just discussing their shock after watching the special.  It was one of those rare times I can remember so many fans coming together to watch a film that was not subtitled in English (the other was the first ""Street Fighter"" animated film) and no one really knew what was going on but because the special featured so much action, it was just worth watching.

I've purchased many incarnations of ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" and to watch it on Blu-ray and to see how vibrant the colors were and how good it looked for an anime 16-years old, was quite nice.

The same can be said in regards to ""BARDOCK, THE FATHER OF GOKU"".  A special that I watched nearly two decades ago and again, to really enjoy because rarely do the ""Dragon Ball Z"" storyline go outside of main core of characters and focus on another group.

Not much was known about Bardock but it was great to watch this special again.  And again, for something that came out so old, and in this case 19 years ago to look so vibrant in colors and looking so great in Blu-ray is a major plus.

FUNimation Entertainment did another fantastic job on this Blu-ray and it may have a bit of the dust and scratches but it was very minimal.  But as a longtime ""DRAGON BALL Z"" fan, ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" is one of those must-own releases.  For DBZ fans, these two specials would be a fantastic addition to your anime collection and for a Blu-ray, the price for both one Blu-ray disc is great.

Overall, another action-packed release that is definitely recommended!",1233187200,12,4498,4.5272277227722775

This includes details about him talking about his son (changed to something unrelated like 'Oh I better not waste time'). That's coming from a long time fan of the dub, they just botched this one up. But the original is still there, so it gets credit where due. Oh again for the faint of heart: cropping unnoticeable.",1219795200,3,576,4.443396226415095
3053598,1,B0010X8NKU,"I bought this item and found it a total disappointment. The reasons being, it's not HD Quality.  Let me explain. I bought this expecting the same refining and color conversion as the previous 2 blu-ray releases. When I watched the ""History of Trunks"" there was a plethora of grain clouding the picture. The colors were not vivid. It did not even look as good as Season releases of Dragonball Z on Remastered Dvd.  Keep in mind this is blu-ray, it's suppose to take it a step higher!

Now the second Movie feature ""Bardock:  Father of Goku"" looked a lot better a ton of grain was removed but is not up to specks as the last 2 releases, but I can call it HD. Unfortunatly what dissappointed me the most was what the Blu-ray box said.  If you have a chance to go to the store and look on the back cover of Blu-Ray box, you will see information on sound quality. You will see these selections:

*Dolby TruHD English 5.1 with Japanese Music

*Dolby TruHD Enigish 5.1 with U.S. Music

*Original Japanese

When you go to the see the setup menu The dolby TruHD with U.S. Music is not there instead you will see Stereo 2.0 . Also known as false advertisement.

How do you go from TruHD to Stereo that's like getting 10 cents instead of a dollar or a bike instead of a car. Come on! Yeah Japanese film masters (whatever!)

Overall they slacked off on this last prodject and if they keep it up I will boycott it.

Please your better off getting the Dvd Version and have an upconverter do the work for you.

If you don't believe me rent it!!!

If by some reason I got a bad copy somebody tell me Please!",1216339200,18,1591,4.295302013422819

3053602,5,B0010X8NKU,"...about the supposed ""bad picture quality"".  I am here to dispel these rumors and give a true fan's review of this product.

First of all, let's start with the first feature in this DragonBall Z Double Feature DVD: The History of Trunks.

This TV Special (or movie, whichever you prefer to call it) was made to show the horrible past that the well-liked character, Trunks, has experienced before traveling back in time to warn Goku and his friends of the looming android threat.

In Trunks' timeline, Androids 17 and 18 has been set loose on the world by the evil Dr. Gero, to wreak havoc on the human race.  Goku, having died of a heart disease before Dr. Gero's evil vision came to fruition, was not able to help his friends fight the Androids.  Thus, 17 and 18 brutally murdered them all, save one: Goku's son, Gohan.  At the time, Trunks was only a baby.

Now, 13 years later, Trunks is aching to fight the Androids, despite his mother's wishes.  After stumbling upon a city full of people that 17 and 18 had annihilated, Trunks asks Gohan to train him.  Gohan agrees, and the two begin training.

Not too long after, Gohan and Trunks witness a new attack by the Androids.  Gohan decides to go and fight, but he won't allow Trunks to go with him.  Will he survive alone against the Androids?  You'll have to watch to find out!

STORY: 9/10

The storyline is great: one of DragonBall Z's better stories.

MUSIC: 7/10

I normally prefer the American soundtrack to the anime, but in this case, I have to say: go with the Japanese score.  It's much better than the faux-rap and bad rock music that Funimation brought to the table.

VIDEO QUALITY: 9/10

The remastering process' effect on the video is quite obvious.  It looks clearer than ever.
________________

Now, let's move on to the second TV Special in this double feature: Bardock, the Father of Goku.

Enter the Saiyan race, a band of ruthless warriors who transform into giant apes in the moonlight.

Bardock and his team have just completed a mission on another planet, having just exterminated another race of beings.  However, they seem to have missed one.

In a sudden move, one of the creatures bursts out from under the rocks and stabs Bardock in the back of his neck.  Afterwards, as Bardock looks on in shock, the creature explains that he has transferred psychic powers into Bardock, which will allow him to see the bitter end of the Saiyan race.

Not liking what the creature has told him, Bardock kills it.  He and his team proceed to fly back to Planet Vegeta.  However, in his healing process Bardock is plagued by visions of the future of planet Vegeta and his newborn son, Kakkarot. But will he be able to warn everyone and stop the destruction of his planet before it's too late?

STORY: 8/10

It's not the best story ever, but it's definitely intriguing and interesting enough to keep you wondering what happens next.

MUSIC: 10/10

In this feature, I would recommend the Dub Music.  It has a sort of rock-like feel, without being too overpowering.

VIDEO QUALITY: 9/10

The video quality is GREAT.  I love watching this on my big TV.  The coloring has obviously been fixed as well.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this release to any person wondering if they should buy it or not.  It is a great release to add to your collection, even if you have/used to have the original DVD release-especially considering Funimation is planning on releasing all of the DragonBall Z movies in this format (i.e. Remastered Double Feature Steelbooks).  Thus, without this, your DBZ collection would NOT be complete when all of the movies and seasons have been released.

3287962,3,B0010X8NKU,"So the main reason I got this (and basically started with this Bluray) was because the old DVD's are becoming more and more difficult to find. Last time I tried getting one of the DVD's I tried going with one of the more rarer ones being the Coolers Revenge, and Return of Cooler. First one I got had skipping problems and audio problems had to send it back. The next one I got was really expensive and still in it's wrapping. But trying to find others was getting more and more difficult. I also liked the metal tins they are in. But because of the rarity and wanting a complete set I started looking around. I was going to go with the brand new collection they have these days offering many of the movies on a few complete discs.

After researching a bit I realized they were missing some at least, such as this set of movies. So I then decided to go with the blurays and hopefully get them. Well I was on the fence for a while because of the fact most of the blurays were pretty pricey in the past and they are still in a way considering they are around 20 dollars. For some people that might not be much, but when you start buying up all of them it starts to add up. Plus the fact is, the newer movies that have come out like Freeza coming back in one of the newer movies won't be in this collection.

But I figured why not. After getting the Bluray and watching it through I was kinda let down. They are good, but at the same time they are missing some stuff. I remember these movies from when they were on tv in the past and almost everything is the same, the few differences such as it's cleaned up is nice. The music is different, and im not talking about the Japanese to English version. When this was on tv in the past they used a lot of the same music, however they also had some of Bruce Faulconers music in there as well at least in the credits. I know a lot of DBZ fans dislike his music, and others enjoy it. I grew up with it and I enjoyed it so the lack of it and thus it being replaced by some crapy rock band song is kinda annoying.

I wasn't to excited spending a bunch of money to have a collection of all these movies to go with my complete DB, DBZ, DBGT DVD series (which is now going to be wonky because of DB super). But just less incentive for me to go with the rest of them since Fundianimation obviously changed out the music because of the dispute they had with Faulconers music or whatever happened. The other thing is there are no extras at all except for trailers for a game, and animes (the standard fare but you would think after this long they would have added some stuff with this Bluray release).

Idk others might like it but I am still on the fence about it. I was hopping for some nostalgia and part of it was missing because of the lack of Faulconers music.",1482192000,4,2798,4.128440366972477

3287983,3,B0010X8NKU,I'm a diehard Dragonball Z fan and I am collecting every single movie for season one Blu-ray but I was very disappointed with this DVD it's sucked and it was so short yes it showed me stuff that I didn't know and gave me information on some of the Dragonball episodes and stuff I didn't actually know about but the Bardock one was way too short and the trunks ending was ridiculous there was nothing to it way too short,1465257600,,419,4.25
3287984,3,B0010X8NKU,"I love DBZ I own both of the movies on this blu ray on DVD. If you're considering buying this do yourself a favor and buy them on dvd, I bet you can find them cheaper. I say this because I just watched the blu ray and dvds back to back to see how it compared. The dvd version is a straight through movie, while the blu ray has 15 second intermissions/interruptions with DBZ art (kinda like the commercial breaks in tv shows) at some pretty intense moments in the movie.  These breaks are throughout both movies on the blu ray. I have a 50 inch HD tv and it was pretty easy to notice a scratch in the digital transfer in Bardoc offset from the middle to the right as well. it was there for about 5 minutes a fine black line that twitched then gone.
As far as the movies go they are exactly the same, remastered (video slight improvement), with the option of either original Japanese or US audio. Honestly the 4 or 5 breaks in it is the deal breaker for me but for you is up to you. I want to give this a 5/5 review but the breaks killed it
This is a great filler but since I take good care of my dvds when I want to watch either of these I will always go with dvd. I have been phasing out my collection buying blu ray and giving away repeat dvds however I will keep these. I have been collecting all the dbz double features and so far I have only been truly happy with 13/bojack but I am still missing cooler, broly, and wrath of the dragon",1463788800,3,1439,4.031468531468532
3287985,4,B0010X8NKU,"I was hoping to replace my VHS version because The History of Trunks is my favorite DBZ feature ever.
It is the uncut version (which I haven't seen before), containing a few extra snippets which could be considered less family-friendly.
Overall it's fine, but some unnecessary changes bothered me.

=================

AUDIO:
Includes options to select preferred audio setting: DOLBY TrueHD English 5.1 w/Japanese Audio; DOLBY Digital: English 2.0 with U.S. Music; and Original Japanese.

***Personally I like the Dream Theater stuff (U.S. Music) in The History of Trunks. The thing I did not like was the transition to the End Credits, sadly the music makes a hard switch from ""Through Her Eyes"" to some generic DBZ music which kills the mood, unlike the the VHS version.

=================

VIDEO:
Looks great, there is noise grain, but I got used to it after a while.

The aspect ratio is adjusted to fill the 16:9 screen format which cuts off the top/bottom sections of the animation to attain this; really not missing much but I would have preferred an option to switch to 4:3.

***The History of Trunks movie contains the bumpers for commercial breaks (again unlike the the VHS version), these have kiddie music and show baby Trunks and Gohan making faces. Some of these bumpers are at key moments in the story and destroy the tone it sets.

=================

Aside from me being picky about a few things, it's worth seeing if you haven't already. I just prefer the VHS version, but it is still the best DBZ movie in my opinion.",1463529600,9,1534,4.846743295019157

But I have been collecting all of Dragon Ball Z and these last movies are the last of the official stuff to complete my collection.  I give this item 3 stars not because of packaging or the movies themselves but solely because I feel I am being in a way coerced into going with the blu ray format strictly because that is the only item that is sold directly from Amazon as well as because the DVD is out of print, the DVD version is almost double the price to buy it...USED.  Really kind of bummed because the rest of my collection is DVD because I can pretty much play that anywhere, the blu ray format really dwindles down the devices I can watch it on....Still really looking forward to completing my collecting with these movies though.

""Unless you're upgrading it from VHS then don't worry about buying a blu-ray version if you already have the DVD.

Having watched the original DragonballZ on DVDs and despite their best attempts at restoring the original films, the blu-ray version doesn't seem to offer any real advantage to the DVD versions.

You will still notice the film grain throughout the film.
Another issue is given that the original version was made for 4:3 the up scaling to 16:9 didn't really do anything for the film and feels like a cropped/stretched version of the original.""

Something I'll add to this review that I didn't mention in the other is as with the picture quality the audio does sound better, but like the picture quality it really isn't that noticeable.",1322179200,10,1214,5.759776536312849

Not only that, but the video quality in the History of Trunks is just terrible.  I'd honestly say that even the orange brick box sets for the seasons of the TV show look dramatically better.  It really doesn't look or sound very good at all.  Other then all the technical stuff it's all still there, and as great as it has ever been.  Both movies are still as awesome as they always have been, but the serious and obvious lack of effort by Funimation (or whoever was in charge of this particular conversion) is very upsetting.",1279065600,2,677,4.419354838709677

The great part about it that makes up for those small mishaps are that these two stories are some of the best ever told.

When the explanation of how the Broly movie was transferred to HD came on, it compared the new footage to the original Japanese footage, and the original Footage looked better.

3288090,4,B0010X8NKU,"I can remember when ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" was shown on TV in Japan back in 1993 the buzz on the anime BBS at the time was just message after message of excitement and shock by ""DRAGON BALL Z"" fans.  That excitement was followed by the large attended screenings at anime fan clubs for ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"", the second special of ""DRAGON BALL Z"".  Seeing the shocked faces of everyone who watched it will always be a lasting memory and this special would become a favorite of mine.

Now nearly two decades later, the first two specials have been released together on Blu-ray Disc courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

VIDEO:

If there is one thing that is important to remind everyone is that these two animated specials are twenty years old.  It's a general known fact that a lot of older anime films, specials and even TV series have not been preserved well.  There is only so much that can be done with the original master source, so let's start with the good and the bad.  The good is that this is probably the best we are ever going to see ""Dragon Ball Z"".  It's on Blu-ray, hi-def and the picture quality was great for that time and the colors are nice and sharp with it's 1080p transfer.  The video was remastered in High Definition and digitally restored and you get a nice wide screen 169 transfer.  Colors look good for two anime films that are twenty years old.

With that being said, the good news is that the specials fared quite well in its translation to Blu-ray.  Because these two were shown on television, you don't get as much scratches or dust.  In fact, I saw very little of any scratches or dust which was great considering how old these two specials were.  Also, the colors were quite vibrant and was very pleased with the video transfer.

AUDIO:

Like the treatment they have given to their TV season box sets of ""DRAGON BALL Z"", this Blu-ray disc features Dolby TrueHD, English 5.1 with Japanese or U.S. Music and the original 2.0 Japanese track.  I love having been given the choice and although I grew up watching ""DRAGON BALL Z"" with its original Japanese language, I have to say that the English dubbing for the US ""DRAGON BALL Z"" is terrific and perfectly cast.

The Dolby TrueHD English 5.1 track is where you are going to hear the difference because of the utilization of the rear channels during the battle scenes.  So, it's great to have FUNimation really work the 5.1 track for the Blu-ray release.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Surprisingly there are no special features included on the Blu-ray but there are a good number trailers for a lot of the recent FUNimation DVD and Blu-ray releases.

I may sound a bit biased towards these two specials because I was there to see the excitement by anime fans not long after the special was shown in Japan and to see the anime club viewings in the US so packed with people watching it in Japanese (without understanding what is going on) and to see anime BBS message boards with long threads from ""DRAGON BALL Z"" fans just discussing their shock after watching the special.  It was one of those rare times I can remember so many fans coming together to watch a film that was not subtitled in English (the other was the first ""Street Fighter"" animated film) and no one really knew what was going on but because the special featured so much action, it was just worth watching.

I've purchased many incarnations of ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" and to watch it on Blu-ray and to see how vibrant the colors were and how good it looked for an anime 16-years old, was quite nice.

The same can be said in regards to ""BARDOCK, THE FATHER OF GOKU"".  A special that I watched nearly two decades ago and again, to really enjoy because rarely do the ""Dragon Ball Z"" storyline go outside of main core of characters and focus on another group.

Not much was known about Bardock but it was great to watch this special again.  And again, for something that came out so old, and in this case 19 years ago to look so vibrant in colors and looking so great in Blu-ray is a major plus.

FUNimation Entertainment did another fantastic job on this Blu-ray and it may have a bit of the dust and scratches but it was very minimal.  But as a longtime ""DRAGON BALL Z"" fan, ""THE HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" is one of those must-own releases.  For DBZ fans, these two specials would be a fantastic addition to your anime collection and for a Blu-ray, the price for both one Blu-ray disc is great.

Overall, another action-packed release that is definitely recommended!",1233187200,12,4498,4.5272277227722775
3288091,4,B0010X8NKU,"The story of Trunks and Bardock are two great side episodes. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z and you haven't watched this, you must get this.

At the start of the year i brought the 'Bardock the father of Goku' on dvd. It had alot of trailers about Cell, Androids,History of Trunks and brief history of Dragonball and in Dragonball Z up to the Android saga. I expected those to be on the digital enhanced steelbook copy.
I like the movies and will buy the other ones that come out.",1220659200,,445,4.373493975903615

I watched both and the details that were omitted or changed in his lines are quite unnecessary. This includes details about him talking about his son (changed to something unrelated like 'Oh I better not waste time'). That's coming from a long time fan of the dub, they just botched this one up. But the original is still there, so it gets credit where due. Oh again for the faint of heart: cropping unnoticeable.",1219795200,3,576,4.443396226415095
3288095,1,B0010X8NKU,"I bought this item and found it a total disappointment. The reasons being, it's not HD Quality.  Let me explain. I bought this expecting the same refining and color conversion as the previous 2 blu-ray releases. When I watched the ""History of Trunks"" there was a plethora of grain clouding the picture. The colors were not vivid. It did not even look as good as Season releases of Dragonball Z on Remastered Dvd.  Keep in mind this is blu-ray, it's suppose to take it a step higher!

Now the second Movie feature ""Bardock:  Father of Goku"" looked a lot better a ton of grain was removed but is not up to specks as the last 2 releases, but I can call it HD. Unfortunatly what dissappointed me the most was what the Blu-ray box said.  If you have a chance to go to the store and look on the back cover of Blu-Ray box, you will see information on sound quality. You will see these selections:

*Dolby TruHD English 5.1 with Japanese Music

*Dolby TruHD Enigish 5.1 with U.S. Music

*Original Japanese

When you go to the see the setup menu The dolby TruHD with U.S. Music is not there instead you will see Stereo 2.0 . Also known as false advertisement.

How do you go from TruHD to Stereo that's like getting 10 cents instead of a dollar or a bike instead of a car. Come on! Yeah Japanese film masters (whatever!)

Overall they slacked off on this last prodject and if they keep it up I will boycott it.

Please your better off getting the Dvd Version and have an upconverter do the work for you.

If you don't believe me rent it!!!

If by some reason I got a bad copy somebody tell me Please!",1216339200,18,1591,4.295302013422819
3288096,4,B0010X8NKU,These are two great movies and I enjoyed watching both. This dvd had the same treatment as the boxset DBZ DVD's. Although I love the case it comes in. So no actual special features here. Suprisingly I got my sister into DBZ after watching The History of Trunks. So now she's really into the whole series. So I do recommend this to anyone who's really into the DBZ story.,1210291200,,370,4.3768115942028984

  Each movie is pretty good in it's own right, but they aren't worth 22 dollars.  $10...maybe $15 is all this featureless compilation is worth.

  If you have seen these before and know what you are getting into then by all means decide for yourself if you'd like to purchase this.

First of all, let's start with the first feature in this DragonBall Z Double Feature DVD: The History of Trunks.

This TV Special (or movie, whichever you prefer to call it) was made to show the horrible past that the well-liked character, Trunks, has experienced before traveling back in time to warn Goku and his friends of the looming android threat.

In Trunks' timeline, Androids 17 and 18 has been set loose on the world by the evil Dr. Gero, to wreak havoc on the human race.  Goku, having died of a heart disease before Dr. Gero's evil vision came to fruition, was not able to help his friends fight the Androids.  Thus, 17 and 18 brutally murdered them all, save one: Goku's son, Gohan.  At the time, Trunks was only a baby.

Now, 13 years later, Trunks is aching to fight the Androids, despite his mother's wishes.  After stumbling upon a city full of people that 17 and 18 had annihilated, Trunks asks Gohan to train him.  Gohan agrees, and the two begin training.

Not too long after, Gohan and Trunks witness a new attack by the Androids.  Gohan decides to go and fight, but he won't allow Trunks to go with him.  Will he survive alone against the Androids?  You'll have to watch to find out!

STORY: 9/10

The storyline is great: one of DragonBall Z's better stories.

MUSIC: 7/10

I normally prefer the American soundtrack to the anime, but in this case, I have to say: go with the Japanese score.  It's much better than the faux-rap and bad rock music that Funimation brought to the table.

VIDEO QUALITY: 9/10

The remastering process' effect on the video is quite obvious.  It looks clearer than ever.
________________

Now, let's move on to the second TV Special in this double feature: Bardock, the Father of Goku.

Enter the Saiyan race, a band of ruthless warriors who transform into giant apes in the moonlight.

Bardock and his team have just completed a mission on another planet, having just exterminated another race of beings.  However, they seem to have missed one.

In a sudden move, one of the creatures bursts out from under the rocks and stabs Bardock in the back of his neck.  Afterwards, as Bardock looks on in shock, the creature explains that he has transferred psychic powers into Bardock, which will allow him to see the bitter end of the Saiyan race.

Not liking what the creature has told him, Bardock kills it.  He and his team proceed to fly back to Planet Vegeta.  However, in his healing process Bardock is plagued by visions of the future of planet Vegeta and his newborn son, Kakkarot. But will he be able to warn everyone and stop the destruction of his planet before it's too late?

STORY: 8/10

It's not the best story ever, but it's definitely intriguing and interesting enough to keep you wondering what happens next.

MUSIC: 10/10

In this feature, I would recommend the Dub Music.  It has a sort of rock-like feel, without being too overpowering.

VIDEO QUALITY: 9/10

The video quality is GREAT.  I love watching this on my big TV.  The coloring has obviously been fixed as well.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this release to any person wondering if they should buy it or not.  It is a great release to add to your collection, even if you have/used to have the original DVD release-especially considering Funimation is planning on releasing all of the DragonBall Z movies in this format (i.e. Remastered Double Feature Steelbooks).  Thus, without this, your DBZ collection would NOT be complete when all of the movies and seasons have been released.
