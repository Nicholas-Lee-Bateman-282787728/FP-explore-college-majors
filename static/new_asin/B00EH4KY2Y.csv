5912095,5,B00EH4KY2Y,One of my favorite British series and it never fails to be excellent.  Can't wait for the next season's offering just wish there were more stories each season.,1405900800,,159,4.678571428571429
5912096,5,B00EH4KY2Y,Thanks.,1404345600,,7,7.0
5912097,5,B00EH4KY2Y,Been a fan for along time.  My wife and I look forward to the releases and eagerly await their delivery.  We enjoy many British Detective Shows but Dalziel & Pascoe is one of our favorites.,1403654400,,189,4.371428571428571
5912098,5,B00EH4KY2Y,D&P one of the best series from the UK. The writing and directing leavee you on the edge of your seat. Kudos to the Brits.,1403481600,,122,3.92
5912099,4,B00EH4KY2Y,"This release has four 100+ minute episodes that are good but not as good as the previous seasons. It seems that the Dalziel character has become rather placid and the biting wit he previously had has been written out of the stories. Pascoe is just coasting along not really doing much at all. The new WPC in these episodes is the most interesting character in this series. I did enjoy the stories but the repartee between Dalziel and Pascoe is just not there any more. I think these four episodes are based on the ""characters created by Reginald Hill"", not on a story written by him. In one episode Pascoe's ex-wife and daughter are brought back for no apparent reason. I do not think this added anything to the story. I think true fans of the series will enjoy these four episodes but if you are a newcomer you may find that they fall short of the mark.",1401148800,6,854,4.4113924050632916
5912100,5,B00EH4KY2Y,"More episodes with the 2 lead characters from the novels of Reginald Hill.
DS Andy Dalziel, pronounced Day-el, (Warren Clarke) heads the cop team with a sour face and disposition, but also provides the occasional suspense breaking laugh. His main man, DI Peter Pascoe (Colin Buchanan) is much more new-school and systematic in sleuthing approach. Their conflicting nature has become expected to true fans.
WPC Maria `Janet' Jackson (Naomi Bentley) is foxy and a newcomer to the series.
Excellent writing involving multiple crimes that tend to merge into a final ending makes this show one of the great Brit TV views. The show ran from 1996 to 2007. Season 9 aired in 2005.

SUBTITLES for all episodes, each originally in 2 parts, and longer than previously done.
Heads You Lose: Murder? Body parts and medical `waste'?
Dead Meat: Pascoe's Ellie returns for a final episode after being gone since 2000.
The Dig: Yes archaeological in nature.
Dust Thou Art: A kidnapping connects to forged paintings.

The series continued to be popular so there will be more to be released in the future.",1399248000,10,1086,4.961538461538462
5912101,5,B00EH4KY2Y,I like the entire Dalziel and Pascoe series by Reginald Hill in both DVDs and Books.  His plots are interesting and in-depth and the characters hold your attention.,1394064000,,164,4.857142857142857
5912102,3,B00EH4KY2Y,"It's a pity, but this Dutch Pal import has all episodes shortened by approx 10 minutes. The cutting has been done ""gently"", but leaves some strange ellipses.
No subtitles other than Dutch ones.
Otherwise good quality.",1338595200,4,217,5.055555555555555
5912103,2,B00EH4KY2Y,"He's gone. The Fat Man has left the building. What we have in his place is a boring, unconvincing cop show that is based more on American-style T.V., rather than reflecting the complex girth of Dalziel's Yorkshire wit and gruff, belligerent intelligence. Pascoe is reduced from valued sidekick to a bland, practically forgotten fall-guy. After Seasons 1-7 of this series, and Reginald Hill's original mystery novels, I can see why reviewers in the U.K. decry the devolvement of these beloved characters. Dalziel and Pasco were well portrayed in Seasons 1-7, so this is a disappointment. Series 10 & 11 improve, but emulate Amercian crime shows. The early Seasons are true to Reginald Hill's characters, but Series 9 is a wretched interpretation. As Dalziel says in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Price-of-Butcher-s-Meat-Dalziel-and-Pascoe-novel/dp/B0042P57MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Price of Butcher's Meat (Dalziel and Pascoe novel)</a>, ""Mebbe it's that postmenstrual traumatic sin thing they go on about these days"" (97:2008).

Heads You Lose: Bad T.V. Writing 101. Repeatedly inflicts a grotesque severed corpse on viewers to elicit a response; the shock-value is actually beyond foolish. Spoiler Alert: Throw a chick at a hospitalized Pascoe, then kill her off at the end, and the viewer is supposed to care. This thankless role is well-played by the fine actor Kirsty Mitchell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen-Complete-Collection/dp/B004EYT8BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen: Complete Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-Histories/dp/B005K8QIS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case Histories</a>). We never do know if the other nurse, who the vain doctor tried to kill in a ridiculous scene, regains consciousness.

Red Meat: Unwatchable. Illegal Asian immigrants, Asian medicine, and animals in a zoo. Warren Clarke thinking playing a singing Dalziel compensates for this awful drivel. This is not the same show we all started with.

The Dig: I've done archaeology in the U.K. An interest in archaeology does not compensate for a thin plot with barely any Dalziel and Pascoe, with both of them now completely out of character. Even great guest-stars Susan Lynch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-Roan-Inish/dp/B00004TJKJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of Roan Inish</a>), and Juliet Aubrey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Village-Case-Files/dp/B003YCI1XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-1-Series-1-2/dp/B001D2WUGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval: Vol. 1 (Series 1 & 2)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-2-Series-3/dp/B002D1XKB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval, Vol. 2 (Series 3)</a>) can't rescue a sodden plot. There's one good line in the whole narrative, ""There is nothing more vicious than an English village."" See Midsomer Murders to be proved right.

Thou Art Dust: For all the PC stuff in the U.K., placing a black law-enforcement officer in chains is NOT a good idea. Then there's the fake Hitchcock music, and a ridiculous plot lacking any redeeming character development, involving an overly convoluted art-forgery and kidnaping scheme.",1335830400,9,3525,7.248243559718969
5912104,5,B00EH4KY2Y,"Series Nine contains the following four episodes on four disks:
