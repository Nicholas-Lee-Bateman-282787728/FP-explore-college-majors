8290028,5,B001CUB5OM,one awesome movie. i watched this movie several times when i recorded it on vhs tape. Since i last looked online for this movie the price went down quite a bit. i took the commercials out at the time i recorded it. unfortunately my vhs  player died. so sold all the vhs tapes to a friend of mine. i am not racist or  anything with black people i think they do a great job acting as well as white people do.  i will definitely  be putting this in my daughters cart and then save it for later. i definitely want  this movie. another movie that  is awesome is to catch a killer with Brian Dehheney. that is a awesome movie to. As soon as the price comes down again more.,1481587200,,667,4.092307692307692

8290030,3,B001CUB5OM,"Lately I've been watching as much as I can about the DC Snipers.  I was an adult when it happened and I had colleagues who experienced the terror directly.  The DC Sniper incident reminds me of how cruel folk can be, even in my own community.  The Atlanta Child Murders happened a bit ""before my time.""  It's referenced in Prince's song ""Annie Christian,"" even though Prince often refuses to sing about race.  So I wanted to know more about this tragedy.

This work said that since Black children were dying in the South, many suspected that this must be some type of racial hate crime.  However, sadly in my community, Black-on-Black crime rears its ugly head here.  Years later, ""Silence of the Lamb"" introduced the masses to the fact that most killings are INTRAracial in nature, not the other way.  I have no reason to believe authorities convicted the wrong person.  That's why I didn't really like the film ""A Murder of Echoes,"" or whatever it was called.  But for those who think the convicted man didn't do it, this work spends time citing the naysayers.

These darn serial killers disgust me with how much they are desperate for attention.  Instead of the suspect lying low, he held his own press conference and dumb stuff like that.  I recently read a whole book on the Green River killer and he was smart enough to keep his mouth shut; it's forensics that caught him decades later.  The work fortunately does add that the child murderer here was a narcissist.

I love watching ""Forensic Files"" and similar shows.  Bill Curtis (sp?) suggests this murder case was so significant because it introduced killer profiling and trace evidence to the public.  Many reports say the suspect eventually snapped on the stand and I wish there was a recording of that.  Something tells me it would have been as powerful as that court scene in which a sistahgurl told Dahmer, ""Jeffrey!  I HATE YOU!!!!""

While I support Amnesty International and its opposition to the death penalty, I am veeeery surprised that this serial killer in the South didn't get capital punishment.  It may irritate some viewers to hear him being interviewed from prison and still being alive.

But one thing still eats at me:  WHY DOES THIS CASE GET SUCH LITTLE COVERAGE????  You can't shake a stick at all the books, videos, and films about Dahmer, Son of Sam, John Wayne Gacy, the Zodiac Killer, etc.  These serial killings are just as tragic, but I bet most don't even remember that it happened.  Que lastima!",1341100800,5,2483,4.713953488372093
