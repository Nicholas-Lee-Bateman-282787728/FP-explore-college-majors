5277617,4,B00991153C,"This dvd box set lives up to it's name, as it does not contain a single bad or sub-par match. It usually takes me a week or so to watch an entire box set, but I watched this one in two days. It truly is a compelling viewing experience. One will see unimaginable sights on this box set, such as John Cena actually having a great match. The only problem with this box set is the exclusion of any matches from 2012's Extreme Rules pay per view. Extreme Rules had three excellent matches: Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan in a 2 out of 3 falls match for the World Heavyweight Championship, CM Punk vs Chris Jericho in a Chicago street fight for the WWE Championship and John Cena vs Brock Lesnar in an Extreme Rules match. The blu-ray edition contains the 2 out of 3 falls match, but there is absolutely no excuse for leaving it off the dvd edition, because it is a strong contender for match of the year (which is another match not on this box set: The TLC pay per view's 6 man TLC tag team match). In closing, this box set is a great summary of WWE's most compelling action from 2012. However, if one wishes to own every great match from 2012, they must also buy a copy of Extreme Rules 2012.",1359072000,3,1181,4.20704845814978

5277620,5,B00991153C,"WWE is gonna continue their Best PPV Matches compilation. I don't know, While these are generally great, they should wait till the year is over before releasing these sets. For example, this set has 2012 matches in it. Yet, 2012 isn't over. Would be better IMO if this was released next year. Just saying.

Punk vs Ziggler (Special Ref: Lauranitis) - WWE Title, Royal Rumble: Great way to start the set as this was definitely one of the best matches of the year.

Daniel Bryan vs. Big Show vs. The Great Khali vs. Santino Marella vs. Wade Barrett vs. Cody Rhodes - WHC (Elimination Chamber Match): I was surprised how they booked Santino to look here. But I'm glad he had his time i nthe spotlight as he's a great athlete. It's too bad that his ring talent is usually taking a back seat to his comedy, which he is also good at.

Taker vs HHH (Special Ref: HBK) - ""The End Of An Era"" HIAC match: This match alone is worth the price of this entire set! Words cannot do it justice! MUST WATCH!

Rock vs Cena - ""Once In A Lifetime"": Great match. Too bad it's unlikely to live up to the ""Once In A Lifetime"" tagline as you can pretty much expect a rematch perhaps as soon as WM29 or sometime later in 2013.

Layla vs Beth Phoenix - Divas Championship: From Over The Limit. One of the better matches of a division that WWE usually does not give attention to.

Christian vs Cody Rhodes - I.C. Title: This is a great match from No Way Out. I loved it. The Sheamus/Ziggler match from this PPV should be here too.

Punk vs Bryan - (No DQ, Special Ref: AJ Lee) WWE Championship: From the MITB PPV. This was a great one without question. These two work very, very well together. So good that I wish their match from Over The Limit was here too.

HHH vs Lesnar: Billed as ""The Perfect Storm"", this one took place at Summerslam. I am not a fan of Brock Lesnar. But he had a dominant showing here IMO.

Orton vs Ziggler: From Might Of Champions. To my knowledge, this is the only time they had a one on one match with each other on a PPV. This was good. But I thought Orton had a better PPV showing at Survivor Series because it teased what seems to be a slow, yet inevitable heel turn in such a brilliant way.

Cena vs Punk - WWE Championship: This match also took place at the Night Of Champions PPV. Doesn't surprise me that this was a tremendous match. I think Punk has brought the best out of John Cena in every one of their matches. Their match from MITB, Summerslam and Night Of Champions have been deserving to be the final match of all three PPV's. Their match involving Big Show from Summerslam was good enough to be here though as well.

Sheamus vs Big Show - WHC: From HIAC. One of Big Show's best matches in the last several years. Sheamus had his usual great showing too. Their Survivor Series match was good too.

Exclusive to Blu Ray:

Cena vs Kane - Ambulance Match: From the Elimination Chamber PPV. Better than their match from the Royal Rumble. But not the best.

Sheamus vs Bryan - (Two Of Of Three Falls Match) WHC: This was one of the best matches from the Extreme Rules PPV. This is the time limit their match at WM28 should have gotten.

Christian vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Tensai vs. Santino Marella vs. Damien Sandow vs. Tyson Kidd vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Sin Cara - MITB (SD): I have personall yseen better MITB matches. But stil lwas a great effort by all involved. I am a Sin Cara fan so it was great to see him here.

Ryback vs Punk - HIAC match for the WWE Championship: I did like this match a lot. As bad as the ending was to some people, it worked as it furthered this feud which, to me at least, is a good thing.

Seems that this set, while what it does have is great and deserving to be here, leaves a bit to be desired to me as some great ones are left out:

Punk vs Jericho - WM28: Two great in ring talents one on one. Can you ask for anything better? I really, really enjoyed this WWE Title match a lot. The personal issues Jericho brought to the feud made it better.

Punk vs Jericho - Extreme Rules: I loved this WWE Title match just as much as their match from WM. This was a Chicago Street Fight and personally, one of the best street fights WWE has ever given us.

It's a damn shame neither of their bouts made the set.

Orton vs Kane - WM28: Many won't agree with me. But since Kane's only match on the set was at a loss to Cena and the fact that Kane's wins at WM are rare, I really would've liked to see this one make the set. Loved Kane's top rope Chokeslam.

Orton vs Kane - Extreme Rules: There's definitely been better ones. But this was still one of the best Last Man Standing matches I've seen.

Sheamus vs Ziggler - N.W.O.: Felt it was deserving to be on the set as it was a good match. The Sheamus/Del Rio matches were good enough to be here too.

Punk vs Bryan - Over The Limit: I love it when these two are in the ring together. They are just that good. Should be on the set. No doubt.

Cena vs Punk vs Show - Summerslam: While the Punk?Cena match fro Night Of Champions was better, I really enjoyed this 3 Way a lot.

Rey Mysterio, Sin Cara, Tyon Kidd, Justin Gabriel, Brodus Clay vs Primo, Epico, Tensai, Prime Time Players (Titus O' Neil, Darren Young) - Survivor Series: One of the best PPV openers in WWE history. And definitely THE BEST PPV OPENER of the year (so far anyway) Great effort from all. Deserving enough to make the set.

Team Foley (Kane, Daniel Bryan a.k.a. Team Hell No, Kingston, Miz, Orton vs Team Ziggler (Dolph Ziggler, Damien Sandow, David Otunga, Alberto Del Rio, Wade Barrett) - Survivor Series: I really enjoyed this match. Only thign I hated was how early Kane was eliminated. Aside from that, one of the best matches of the show. Loved the tease of Orton's heel turn here.

Sheamus vs Big Show - Survivor Series: Becoming a heel was the best thing to happen to Big Show as his career has turned out great because of it. Great enough to have him as WHC even if it isn't for a long time. I love his feud with Sheamus. Their match here really got my attention.

Cena vs Ryback vs Punk - Survivor Series: I always love it when Punk & Cena are against each other whether it's one on one, in a 3 Way, or whatever because they seem to bring the best out of each other. Punk has unquestionably brought out the best in John Cena. Adding a machine like Ryback is just icing on the cake for me. Great match IMO.

And who knows? Maybe some matches from the upcoming TLC PPV. I'm really looking forward to Ryback/Team Hell No vs The Shield the most.",1354924800,,6503,4.225181598062954
5277621,4,B00991153C,"Just like the release last year, WWE wants to put this collection out before the end of the year so matches from the Survivor Series & T.L.C. events are not included in this collection.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler with John Laurinaitis as the special referee - Before the match, it was made clear that with Triple H appearing on RAW the next night to evaluate & possibly fire John from his position at RAW General Manager, John decided to make himself the outside enforcer while having a regular referee in the ring & even removed Vickie Guerrero from ringside. Both men went back & forth throughout the match with some highlights being Punk's suicide dive onto Dolph on the outside, Dolph taking Punk's leg from under him while on the top rope causing a bad case of whiplash on Punk's neck, a series of counters & attempts that went from the sleeper to an anaconda vice back to the sleeper, and Punk countering the fameasser into a powerbomb that caused Dolph's head to bounce off the mat. The match itself was nothing more than a backdrop to continue the storyline between Ace & Punk but unlike how Cena vs. Kane was earlier, these two delivered a really good performance in the match itself so if you can get past the storyline they were pushing & just watched the action, this was a good encounter & definitely the match of the night.
Royal Rumble

Elimination Chamber Match: World Champion Daniel Bryan vs. Big Show vs. Santino Marella vs. Great Khali vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Wade Barrett - It should be noted that throughout the night, they kept showing these backstage segments where Santino was trying to channel the energy of Rocky Balboa knowing that he was going into this match as the underdog (I personally found them funny). This was a match, based off entertainment value alone, that was way better than expected going in with the fact that Khali was one of the participants (guess that's WWE's response to TNA's Ring Ka King project) but didn't effect the match at all while the story of Santino being the underdog really caught on to the point where the crowd was getting behind him here. While Bryan & Barrett & Rhodes also had good showings here including some hard hitting spots getting thrown into the pods but without a doubt the one moment to look out for here was Big Show getting his hands on Bryan to the point where he just beat the living hell out of him inside his pod.
Elimination Chamber

Hell In A Cell Match w/Special Referee Shawn Michaels: Undertaker vs. Triple H - Couple of notes here as Jim Ross returned to join commentary for this match, Michael Cole pointed out the interesting facts that not only has Triple H has won more HIAC matches than Undertaker but also never lost a match where Shawn was the referee, and Undertaker finally revealed his new haircut. Taker was dominate at the start as he targeted Triple H's head using anything he could get his hands on from the steps to the cell, and his own head to deliver headbutts causing HHH to have a bad bruise on his face. The steps were put into the ring where Triple H was able to deliver a spinebuster only for Taker to apply the Hell's Gate right after before Triple H showcased his strength & dead-lifted Taker to get out of the hold. Shawn played an important role as the referee as both guys got physical with him at times while also trying to be the voice of reason such as when Triple H continued to deliver non-stop chairshots to Taker's back to the point where Shawn tried to step in telling him, ""just pin him because you know he won't give up!"" only for Triple H to respond ""You end it or I will!"" This was physically brutal as both men didn't hold back with the chairshots & other weapons while just beating each other into exhaustion & Shawn definitely played an important role here. This lived up to the hype, no questions asked.
WrestleMania XXVIII
[Undertaker: The Streak]

The Rock vs. John Cena - The Rock came into this match ready to go as he took Cena off guard with armdrags & even catching him in an inside cradle early on. Cena targeted Rock's midsection by grounding him on the mat with a bearhug & moves like a belly to belly suplex before taking the action on the outside where he kept dropping Rock on his ribs. The match continued to pick up from here with both men trading momentum by kicking out of each others signature moves while pulling out all the stops like Cena's legdrop from the top rope while Rock threw Cena into the steps at one point before one man made one mistake in letting the crowd get to him which cost him the match in the end.
WrestleMania XXVIII
[Rock vs. Cena: Once In A Lifetime]

WWE Divas Champion Layla vs. Beth Phoenix - Beth was out to get the woman who she feels took her title shot at the previous PPV in Layla and should be noted that the crowd was chanting ""We Want Kharma"" before the match. Layla was able to counter a slam attempt with a head scissors followed by a crossbody from the corner early before Beth focused on the knee using the ringpost & ropes to wrap it around while stretching it with moves like the half crab before Layla fought back countering a body press attempt into a spike DDT & rolling through the Glam Slam before giving a Beth a ""Rude Awakening."" There were some moments here where you saw their timing was slightly off but still a good match from the divas.
Over The Limit

Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Cody Rhodes - Cody tried to intimidate Christian by shoving him only for Christian to respond by slapping Cody off his feet & taking to offense right to him by knocking Cody off the apron in a unique way followed by a dropkick through the ropes before Cody eventually caught Christian & knocked him onto the apron. Cody focused on Christian's arm after hanging it on the ropes followed by stomps, hammerlock, using the ring post, and even shoving Christian off the top rope with his shoulder hitting the apron on the way down but Christian fought back on the floor including using the steps for a tornado DDT. Both men really stepped it up as they had counters & blocks to the others signature moves resulting in a match that definitely topped their previous PPV match.
No Way Out

No Disqualification Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Daniel Bryan with A.J. as the special referee - Both men started unloading on each other with punches & kicks early on while trading momentum with moves like Bryan with a running knee off the apron & Punk doing a springboard clothesline off the barricade onto Bryan crotched on the other barricade. Both men them proceeded to take advantage of the No DQ rule with Bryan using the steel steps & a kendo stick to work over Punk's midsection along with later doing a version of the Yes Lock with the stick while Punk later used the stick himself & did an innovative version of a bodyslam using a chair before a table was later brought to use. Both men continued to go back & forth including a sequence of a GTS attempt into a Yes Lock attempt onto another GTS that was turned into a frankensteiner before a superplex that looked like it took as much out of who received it as the one who gave it. A.J. did play some factors here such as introducing the chair into the match & dropping it in the middle of both men but didn't have the story involving her overshadow the quality match expected from Punk & Bryan with both men using the No DQ rule to add to the match.
Money In The Bank

No Disqualification/No Count Out Match: Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar - Brock took Triple H into the corner & kept going for his previously injured arm early before Triple H was able to keep knocking Brock over the top rope which Brock responded by getting more serious taking off his fighting gloves. Brock dominated from here with a grounded punch right to the back of the head before targeting Triple H's arm with a hammerlock slam & stomps while also using whatever he could at ringside like the announce table & ring ropes & the steel steps before Triple H was able to find a weakness on Brock & work over that area. They really picked it up from here by countering each others signature moves from the Triple H's Pedigree to Brock's F5 & kimora lock before eventually one of them was caught with no way to escape. This was one of those types of matches where it wasn't bad at all as they told a good story focusing on injured body parts but it didn't live up to the hype as it didn't really come off as a ""fight"" unlike how their last two singles matches have (HHH at ""WrestleMania"" & Brock at ""Extreme Rules"").
SummerSlam

Randy Orton vs. Dolph Ziggler - Both men traded momentum early on with both men knowing each other so well that they had the others offense such as Orton able to counter Dolph's fameasser into a powerbomb while Dolph used Orton's old grounded headlock but bridged his body in order to add extra pressure before Orton took a page out of his father's playbook with a top rope superplex. Orton went for his hanging DDT with Dolph able to counter forcing Orton to take it to the outside where Orton was able to hit it but hurt himself in the process before Dolph came back with a counter to the RKO & Orton countering Dolph's own sleeper as well. This was a very competitive match between both men that resulting in the fans showing support for both men throughout the match.
Night Of Champions

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. John Cena - Paul Heyman gave an introduction to ""his guy"" in Punk before his entrance while Punk work N.Y. Yankees style gear & held up the championship for an extreme amount of time just to get under the skin of the crowd. Both men went back & forth with some wrestling early with Punk showing off to the point where he walked on Cena to go to the top rope which Cena had a response to in attempting an electric chair that was countered into a DDT by Punk followed by taking a page out of Great Muta's playbook with a his variation of a chinlock. Cena got more aggressive throwing Punk into the crowd near his Dad before suplexing him back to ringside with Cena later going out of his comfort zone by doing a suicide dive onto the outside onto Punk. Both men were matching each othe move for move & counter for counter like Punk at one moment caught Cena in the middle of one of his trademark moves into the anaconda vice that was rolled over into an STF that was countered into a crossface & later Cena was able to counter a GTS attempt into the STF before another GTS attempt that countered into an A.A. Both men kept kicking out of each others signature moves while also attempting to aerial with Cena's top rope legdrop & Punk with a moonsault to the point where Punk even took a page out of The Rock's playbook to no avail. Punk is one of those people who can pull the best wrestling performance out of Cena & that continues to be showcased here as this was on the level of their previous Money In The Bank & SummerSlam matches from last year with the only downfall being the finish but it opened the door for another match which is something I wouldn't object to.
Night Of Champions

World Champion Sheamus vs. Big Show - Show came out dominate causing Sheamus to attempt to chop him down with a shoulderblock to the knee followed by other shoulderblocks before Show caught him & punished Sheamus just beating him down in the ring with hard chops in the corner to the point where you saw blisters on Sheamus' chest. Show took the match to the outside where he threw Sheamus so hard over the announce table that Jim Ross almost got taken out in the process before taking the match back in the ring & worked him over very slowly with moves like the bear hug while always catching Sheamus whenever he tried to build some offense like kicking off the Texas Cloverleaf so hard that it sent Sheamus to the outside. Things started to pick up towards the end with Sheamus finally able to hit some heavy blows against Show that took him down before both men kept hitting signature moves that have normally won them matches in the past only for both men to keep kicking out. They attempted to tell the story of Sheamus being ""out of his element"" as he's facing someone more powerful than he is but Show's domination during a majority of the match was just too slow of a pace & went on for too long that it took a while to get into the comeback by Sheamus.
Hell In A Cell

(Blu-Ray) Ambulance Match: John Cena vs. Kane - For those who have never seen the three previous Ambulance Matches in history (two in WCW, one in WWE), the only way to win this match is to put your opponent in the back of the ambulance & close the door. With Kane winning the only other match of this type in WWE history (S. Series '03 vs. Shane McMahon), he was the heavy favorite here as both men started in the ring but shortly ended up brawling out of the ring down the isle towards the ambulance where some of the objects inside the vehicle was brought up & used as a weapon. They both fought back to ringside where Kane was able to pull a wheelchair from under the ring (seriously, who puts that under the ring?) before it was eventually used as a weapon. They continued to brawl through the crowd before going back to ringside where Cena ""embraced the hate"" & punished Kane with everything available at ringside including the microphone, monitor, steel steps, and the announce table. Despite the way this entire feud developed (I personally didn't care for the crappy soap opera acting or their previous PPV match at the Rumble), this was a good match & the highlight of this feud as Cena is better at brawling & using weapons while Kane has also had his best encounters in these ""no rules"" environments.
Elimination Chamber

(Blu-Ray) 2 Out Of 3 Falls: World Champion Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan - Although Bryan tried to heel the crowd earlier, they were heavily behind him in this town that was a regular stop during his days in Ring Of Honor while Sheamus came out with a shirt reminding them of their last encounter at WrestleMania. Sheamus went for the kick early which Daniel avoid but later catching Bryan in a sharpshooter/boston crab combination submission before catching Bryan coming off the apron & slamming him into the barrier. Bryan was able to mount some offense including a unique pinning combination locking Sheamus' shoulders with his legs & heavily targeting his shoulder with a grounded hammerlock & using the ringpost to his advantage. Bryan from there kept beating on Sheamus with his aggression eventually coming back to haunt him but that didn't stop Bryan from being able to get the YES-lock with Sheamus able later to be get his kick in that turned Bryan inside out. This was the yearly match on this PPV that was the quality of match we SHOULD have gotten WrestleMania (in this case, the previous two Mania's they had a scheduled match) because this was both men's best performance in recent memory & you saw just by how exhausted they were they gave you everything & told a story along the way.
Extreme Rules

(Blu-Ray) World Championship Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Santino Marella vs. Tyson Kidd vs. Christian vs. Sin Cara vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Damien Sandow vs. Tensai vs. Dolph Ziggler - As expected in a multi-man ladder match, this was full of crazy moments & spots such as Cody Rhodes backdropping Sin Cara who turned it mid-air into a dropkick on Dolph, Dolph taking very dangerous falls throughout the match including one with Sin Cara, Christian's top rope splash onto the ladder, the involvement of Vickie Guerrero, Tensai's domination, the innovative way Tyson Kidd knocked Dolph off a ladder, Sin Cara having a case of ""deja vu"", and Cody Rhodes being speared off a ladder. This was one of those ladder matches that was a stunt show with the crazy bumps & spots with the winner of the match reflecting the same feelings I had, ""It's About Damn Time!""
Money In The Bank

(Blu-Ray) Hell In A Cell Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Ryback - Punk tried avoiding Ryback but was eventually caught as Ryback dominated tossing Punk into the cage multiple times that hurt Punk's arm causing Punk to resort to tactics like using a fire extinguisher from under the ring to temporary blind Ryback before he made Punk pay for that with a punch that went through a steel chair. Ryback continued to overpower Punk causing Punk to go aerial with a few blows off the top rope & even a suicide dive to the outside that only hurt his arm even more but kept his advantage by using Ryback's momentum against him such as moving out of the way of his charge towards the steps while also bring a kendo stick into the match before the another man involved in this match made the difference with an aftermath that can be defined by the phrase ""you may have won the battle but you lost the war."" WWE put themselves into a no win situation here (another story for another time) with Cena being injured as they had to keep their current version of Ultimate Warrior/Goldberg strong while still keeping the title on Punk and the added stipulation of Hell In A Cell didn't leave much room for anything other finish as they had to have a winner in this match resulting in a match that was on the level of Undertaker/Big Boss Man where it was easily forgettable once it was over & didn't live up to the standards this type of match.

For example Sheamus Discusses His Involvement at Elimination Chamber, Layla Discusses Her Match at Extreme Rules, Christian Discusses His Match at Over The Limit & John Cena, The Miz & CM Punk Discuss their Matches at Summerslam, CM Punk vs John Cena vs Big Show from Summerslam 2012 was not included in this set & neither was The Miz vs Rey Mysterio so why do they have interviews with CM Punk, John Cena & The Miz discussing their Match at Summerslam if it was not included in this set? The only Matches included in this set with John Cena & CM Punk were Wrestlemania XXVIII John Cena vs The Rock Once In A Lifetime Match, Royal Rumble WWE Championship Match CM Punk vs Dolph Ziggler with Special Guest Referee Johnny AceNight of Champions WWE Championship Match John Cena vs CM Punk with Paul Heyman, Elimination Chamber Ambulance Match John Cena vs Kane & Hell In A Cell WWE Championship Hell In A Cell Match CM Punk with Paul Heyman vs Ryback. Same thing goes for the interviews with Sheamus, Layla & Christian, the only matches included in this set that they were in were from Money In The Bank Christian vs Dolph Ziggler vs Santino Marella vs Cody Rhodes vs Tensai vs Damien Sandow vs Tyson Kidd vs Sin Cara Smackdown World Heavyweight Championship Contract Match, from Extreme Rules Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan for the World Heavyweight Championship in a 2 Out of 3 Falls Match, from Over The Limit Layla vs Beth Phoenix for the Divas Championship, from No Way Out Christian vs Cody Rhodes for the Intercontinental Championship & from Hell In A Cell Big Show vs Sheamus for the World Heavyweight Championship. So again why have Sheamus discuss his Match from Elimination Chamber, Layla discuss her match at Extreme Rules, Christian discuss his match at Over The Limit & The Miz, John Cena & CM Punk discuss their matches at Summerslam when NONE of those matches were even included in this set? Now the matches I hoped were included in this set but were not were Randy Orton vs Kane in a Falls Count Anywhere Match from Extreme Rules, Randy Orton vs Kane from Wrestlemania XXVIII, Randy Orton vs Alberto Del Rio from Hell In A Cell, CM Punk vs Kane vs Daniel Bryan for the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat Match from No Way Out, CM Punk vs Daniel Bryan for the WWE Championship Match from Over The Limit, CM Punk vs Big Show vs John Cena in a Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship from Summerslam, Team Foley vs Team Ziggler from Survivor Series, CM Punk vs Chris Jericho vs Kofi Kingston vs Dolph Ziggler vs The Miz vs R-Truth in a Elimination Chamber Match for the WWE Championship from Elimination Chamber, CM Punk vs Chris Jericho in a Chicago Street Fight Match from Extreme Rules, CM Punk vs Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship from Wrestlemania XXVIII, Randy Orton vs Sheamus vs Chris Jericho vs Alberto Del Rio in a Fatal Four Way Match for the World Heavyweight Championship from Over The Limit & CM Punk vs Ryback vs John Cena in a Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship from Survivor Series.",1360713600,,3289,4.595238095238095
