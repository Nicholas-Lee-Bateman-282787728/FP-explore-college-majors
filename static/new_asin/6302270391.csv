7823256,4,6302270391,"Radio repair man, Tommy, is terrified at being shamelessly pursued by the mistress of a jealous prize fighter, but then he falls in love with the girlfriend of the local mob boss. This PreCode romantic comedy/crime drama is engaging, humorous and entertaining. A highlight of the film is the featured performance of 20-year-old Ginger Rogers. Light, enjoyable entertainment.",1506643200,,374,5.4655172413793105
7823257,5,6302270391,This movie is hilarious! Eddie Quinlan and Ginger Rogers are very funny. She uses dry humor and wise-cracks. Robert Armstrong very funny as a fighter. Quinlan mesmerizes you. This should be on dvd. Someone should transfer vhs to disc.,1408579200,,234,5.0256410256410255
7823258,5,6302270391,"Ginger Rogers pre Fred Astaire days, and what a sassy delight she is. The tape is of good quality and worth looking for and buying. One to snap up as it isn't available on disc.",1391126400,2,177,4.085714285714285
7823259,3,6302270391,"I saw this movie on TCM TV last night and although it wasn't a box-office hit, it was decent entertainment especially with Ginger Rogers in the cast. I didn't recognize Robert Armstrong in the cast, however.  Quinlan was a good actor.  What ever happened to him?  I couldn't find anything on the 'net concerning his career or biography.",1269129600,3,336,4.758620689655173
