3594105,4,B001G0N22G,"""Burn After Reading"" continues the Coen Brothers' remarkable streak of making darkly comic, deliciously twisted thrillers that are populated by people who are so quirky, stupid, selfish, superficial, and sympathetic (some of them anyway) that they seem like real people instead of reel people. This film has hilarious performances, each one, like each character, with different nuances and movitations.

Oswald Cox is the head CIA over the Balkans region, Osbourne Cox, who gets called into his boss' office one day to find out that he is being demoted (""As you know, things aren't going well over there,"" he is told). He is so angry that he quits, and begins writing his memoirs. A CD containing his writings falls into the hands of two gym workers, played by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand. Their attempt to at first return the CD, and then blackmail Cox begins a comic-tragic chain of events that involves them, Cox, Cox's shrewish wife (played by Tilda Swinton), Harry Pfarrer, a treasury agent who sleeping with Cox's wife and McDormand, and Pitt and McDormand's boss at the gym (played by Richard Jenkins), who has an unpsoken crush on McDormand.

This is one of those stories where it's not only obvious that everyone does not live happily ever, but that some of the characters won't live at all. The Coens' ear for dialogue and talent for getting the most out of their actors in on full display. Everyone's performance is tremendously well done. With the exception of Jenkins' character, everyone's reason for what they doing is either selfish, shallow, and/or stupid.

""Burn After Reading,"" as with most of the other Coens' movies, is not for everyone, but those who enjoy black as night comedies, this movie is a treat.",1228003200,3,1730,4.938144329896907

3594108,4,B001G0N22G,"Everyone in this film has their own way of being slime, and it makes for great entertainment. There's a lot of confusion and betrayal with umpteen characters to dislike for various quirky reasons.

It's extremely funny and the situations involved are typically unusual. Brad Pitt is outstanding as dim gym trainer Chad, and John Malkovich is also superb.

An excellent film.

3594109,4,B001G0N22G,"The Coen brothers are nothing if not eclectic in their choice of film projects.  ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowksi"", ""No Country for Old Men"" and, now, ""Burn After Reading"".  Each film is quite unique.  There is certainly no danger of the brothers being type cast.

""Burn After Reading"" is a spoof spy film set in Washington.  Its ensemble cast includes George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich and a wonderfully and eccentrically cast Brad Pitt.  No one character steals the show.  This could be a danger with such names but, somehow, the brothers ensure that each character has a role to play in this romp without any one actor taking all the lime light.

The plot involves a whole series of misunderstandings and mistakes as the lives of each character come closer together.  In the end, paranoia runs rampant as some seem to win but, others, clearly lose.  Perhaps the best way to describe the film is as black comedy.  It is more subtle than the usual Hollywood comedy in the style of Jim Carrey or Steve Martin.  It is also much darker.  Yet, for all the double dealing, mistakes and misapprehensions, the story manages to remain connected as a whole.  At no time does the viewer fail to join the dots.

Do not go looking for some greater or deeper meaning.  ""Burn After Reading"" is simply a well cast spoof.",1226707200,28,1331,4.696969696969697

3594111,5,B001G0N22G,"This leaves those in the intelligence business scratching their heads wondering what actually happened and how did it happen. Who cares, it was funny.",1226188800,,150,5.291666666666667
3594112,5,B001G0N22G,"After the true genius of No Country For Old Men, the Coen Brothers come back with a whole new dimension. Burn After Reading is a dark comedy about idiots faced with an intelligent and complex situation. Two Gym instructors Linda Litsky (Frances McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) find a disc containing the memoirs of ex CIA agent Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich). They, being idiots think it's a disc containing top secret information and try to bribe Osbourne for money which would help pay for Linda's cosmetic surgery. Things don't go to plan as Osbourne has bigger things on his mind, his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with the paranoid Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney).

This film is actually quite intelligent in its own right, the characters seem well defined and are played superbly. The characters were specifically written for the actor playing them and it really shows.

John Malkovich portrays the agent lost of all hope well, you become quite intimidated by both his intelligence and temper.

George Clooney as the paranoid individual who's having more affairs than you can wave a stick at doesn't falter. He's jumpy, but hey who wouldn't be if you were sleeping with three different women. This eratic behaviour becomes a bit tragic and leads to the death of one of the characters in the film.

Brad Pitt as the loveable and wannabe cunning idiot is fantastic, the facial expressions and general stereotypical dexterity of what we would expect a personal trainer to be really works. This becomes especially amusing when he enters into the bribing game with Malkovich and starts to enter into the character of cunning spy. It has to be seen to be believed.

Frances McDormands character is the real shining light of the whole film as she's the catalyst leading up to the films biggest events. She's a middle aged gym instructor paranoid over the look of her body. While trying to get plastic surgery, she's turned down by her insurance company and is the one that convinces Pitts character to bribe Cox. She's a woman on the edge of giving up on life and wants to take one last leap into the chance of a relationship, but is made even more nervous by her own body insecurities.

The Coens once again create a film that is both surreal and believable, the characters are shockingly brilliant. The scenario is a bit over the top but comes together perfectly. There is something that bothered me, however, and that's the fact that every character in the film seemed to be having an affair with someone else. I don't know, maybe that was the whole point that made the film work. For fans of the Coens this is definitely one that sits proudly in their film catalogue next to such greats as No Country For Old Men and The Big Lebowski. I would strongly recommend it to any film fan overall, it's definitely worth it just for the Brad Pitt & Clooney facial expressions. Be warned though as if you're easily offended by swearing, then you might as well take your pad and pen with you to start writing your complaints letter.",1225497600,143,3050,4.734463276836158

3594156,5,B001G0N22G,"Yes, believe or not, I somehow managed to extract a serious message from this film.  This may be a bit twisted, perhaps as twisted as the film itself, or perhaps this is claiming too much, but all the same

The First Moment:
The film demonstrates the reality of knowledge dispersion. The knowledge by which we run a government, a business, or even our own affairs is actually broken up into little pieces and dispersed amongst many allied, competing and indifferent parties.  We flatter ourselves in the belief that we have a grasp of the whole situation or of the entire process or that we know all that there is to be known or that needs to be known about a given endeavor.  We flatter ourselves with our immense reservoir of knowledge, sure of our certain conclusions, mistaking our mistaken inferences for sound deductions, pretending to be exact in a world that is only approximate. We go forth, so armed in our knowledge and confident in our conclusions only to stumble into one surprise after another in life only to wonder how we did not see that one coming, shocking, I know.  We are so much smarter than this, just ask anyone.  For example, I have yet to find a person who did not have an abundant amount of common sense.  In fact, there seems to be an oversupply of it as no one that I can find has ever said that they did not have enough and would appreciate having a little more.  Common sense then is a very common commodity as shown in this wonderful and fun film, the serous lesson of which is the very real and serious reality of dispersed knowledge and the risks of acting on incomplete information, partial perspective and imperfect knowledge, but often we have no choice; this is just a part of the human condition.  No one person or group of persons can possess all on the knowledge needed to properly plan and coordinate all of the activities, associations and social behaviors in even a small group of people personally known to each other.

The Second Moment:
Wait, no!  On second thought this is completely wrong.  Instead, this film is about the absurdity of life. A life that is a rapid succession of beings that appear one by one, flourish perhaps, and then die; life as mere transitory symmetry and a monetary illusion of order. With the devices of exaggerated characters and an irrational plot, the film shows how superficial are our lives and how little we understand ourselves, let alone others.  We are a bunch of ridiculous people running around in an absurd world, too self-absorbed to realize anything or anyone else very clearly.  This film is the absurd writ large enough for us to see it, and we need to see it. It needs to be writ large because most of us cannot live by or in this knowledge of how absurd life really is and chose instead to pretend that the absurd is not real. The only facts that are true are the exaggerations as Theodor Adorno once put it - meaning that the only way to call attention to the facts is by exasperating them. We do not like to admit that we are up against the incontrovertibly of the world; that it is just out there and our relationship to it absurd; that it is a dead-end relationship that does not lend itself to explanation.  This is why the film ends with no real reason or explanation for the events depicted. This is too disturbing for us as human beings to accept; that we live in a meaningless and absurd world.  We are forced to live with this knowledge but we cannot live by this knowledge. So, out of necessity, we simply do not accept it and get on with our pretend lives. We see in the film what happens when the subjective value laden human consciousness collides with an objectively indifferent world - the result is quite literally the realization of the absurd.

This is why the film opens and closes with the zoom-in, zoom-out camera perspective from above. The view from above allows us to pretend that we are removed from the foulness of the human race.  We can pretend that we rise above these petty earthly troubles as we look down upon these existential sufferings from above.  But in the end, we are all human, all too human.

The Third Moment:
Postscript, I found it interesting that there were no child characters in this film.  I think this is because children represent an innocence not available in the crass & crude adult world of doing and pursuing in a toxic an alienation soaked culture.",1479600000,2,4396,4.5462610899873255

It seems to me (and my mum by the way) that this movie is a deeply subversive satire, a broad farce and savage indictment. Of what? Of the United States, and the dilemmas of greed, stupidity and violence which have become all-too-commonplace in American public and private life.

Witness the prominent framing of national landmarks in scenes throughout the film. The Coen brothers are highly intelligent filmmakers, and although a surface reading of the movie may give an entirely different interpretation, to me it's as if they set out to show the deeply troubled and troubling current situation of the US, and how far it has strayed from its founding ideals.

3594320,1,B001G0N22G,"After viewing ""O Brother, where art thou?,"" which I was intending to rate as a 1-star - no redeeming qualities - I watched ""Burn....,"" with expectations of getting my money's worth this time. Both movies featured George Clooney, but ""Burn"" also included several top - or, recognizable - actors. There was Brad Pitt, playing a clueless, doofy fitness instructor who gets himself punched in the nose by John Malkovitch when he tries to be cool and get some reward money out of the ex-CIA agent for returning some secret classified information on a disc; and Malkovitch, as a burned-out agent who may or may not a drinking issue and who does nothing but rant and spew out obvious, simple lines, e.g. ""what the fuck are you talking about?"" and ""You have no idea what you are fucking with ... this is way over your head,"" and that last clause he stole from a Jason Bourne movie that was in a class way above this one.

Then there is the head of the CIA, a man whose name escapes me, but who has been in many spy movies. He represents what? the sanity factor in a nutty movie. He is where the buck stops. He is the guy that M.'s supervisor comes to with the latest reports of the nutty characters have done - smashed cars, talked to Russians, murdered each other and fucked each other - to which he invariably replies with the voice of reason: ""No, fuck 'em"",.....""Pay her,""....,or, ""Let him stay in the coma; if he comes out of it we will deal it then.."" and ""Burn the body,"" Such decisive and to-the-point orders, delivered in his deep, confident voice  reasure us that our nation's security is in good hands.

And there is the boss of the fitness gym, a sensitive and careing man, though not particularly strong, who played the hapless lawyer against Clooney in ""Intolerable cruelty,"" a much funnier, class movie, that starred, Catherine Zeta-Jones, a class act herself. This time he is a hapless back-stop to the clueless blonde and simple Brad.

And the women. No-name, unattractive sluts. Compare this to ""Intolerable..."", where you had the pretty bimbo's as a sort of setting to showcase Zeta-Jpnes' dreamy, smooth, sexy, poised..... words fail me. These broads are all cuckolding married men on the side. Clooney's character's old lady's only redeeming quality is that she can swear - using American idiom - with a British accent: ""...get the fuck dressed...what the fuckk..."" None of them are memorable - none of them would I go out with on a second date.

If the movei were funny, or dramatic, or had a point, or showed some consistency, or...  they routinely kill people with such indifference - Brad Pitt gets shot by Clooney - in almost an accident - it happened so fast - and then Clooney runs away - which I can relate to as he is just an ordinary guy who who was surprised to find a man luking in the bedroom closet of his whore's apt. - so why was there a bucket of blood all over the closet - from a clean shot through the head??? Who did the screen-writng here? The fitness center boss gets confronted in Malkovitch's whore's home, by Malkovitch, wearing a bathrobe, with a drink in one hand and a generic automatic in the other. He shows some character by not begging for his life and by telling the truth when Malkovitch babblingly accuses him of being his woman's lover, of working for one or more of the spy organizatons, of being one of the idiots that have been fucking up Malkovitch's life forever. He just calmly denies the accusations and explains that he is tryng to help his people: Brad Pitt, and the inept, goofy blonde. And so M. shoots him. Casually.  In the chest. With what? a 9mm.? So then he recovers and attacks M. with a piece of hardware and sprints up the stairs and out to the street? Say what? With a hole through his lung? So M., in his rage hacks the man to pieces with a hatchet. O.K.!

  And I don't appreciate the wild driving and smashing unoffending cars up either.

IS there some message here? That our brave, dedicated men and women in positions of national security are just ordinary humans? Actually they are  trash.  This is a spy spoof, O.K., but it missed the mark - good actors in silly roles with bad dialogue, incoherent plot.

In the end this Burn was not as awful as ""O Brother..."" which was an attempt at a slap-stick comedy, a parody of Southern culture.. or something? If there was a plot I missed it - but - you are wondering why I sat throught the movie if it was so bad? - I kept skipping ahead to get to the good part.

3594390,4,B001G0N22G,"Better paced than ""Inside Llewyn Davies"" and less sublimely inconsequential than ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Burn After Reading"" is a considerable success. It's a ""bloody farce,"" to use the 17th Century critic Thomas Rhymer's description of ""Othello,"" and we expect of farce that we will be able to detach ourselves from any sympathy with the characters and thus free ourselves to enjoy the machinery of a well-oiled plot. The machinery is in good working order here, but two characters do engage our sympathies to some extent and thus complicate and deepen our engagement with the movie, without our really thinking them anything but stupid -- but with them we feel that anxiety makes them stupid, and therefore we engage with them to a different degree than we do with the others. They are Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), the former devastated by a demotion as a CIA analyst, and the latter a middle-aged gym employee desperately seeking a number of cosmetic surgeries. It wouldn't be true to say we care about them -- finally, they are too stupid -- but we don't exactly not care either. In addition to Malkovich and McDormand, there is superb work by Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Tilda Swindon, Jeffrey DeMunn, and J. K. Simmons. The whole cast, in fact, is just superb, and Pitt and Clooney in particular play stupid, silly people with no actorly vanity whatsoever.

The basic plot initiator is that the disgraced Osbourne quits the CIA and plans to write a tell-all book about it. Some of that book is put on a CD, along with his financial information, by his wife (Tilda Swindon), so that she can take it to her lawyer and have him use it in divorce proceedings to Swindon's character's advantage. The CD is accidentally left in a gym by an employee of the law firm handling the Osbourne divorce, and it falls into the hands of two employees, Chad (Pitt) and Linda, who, thinking it much more important than it is, try to use it to get money, some of which will pay for Linda's surgery, which her insurance from her work won't cover. Cox's wife (Swindon), a pediatrician, is having an affair with Treasury employee Harry Pfarrer (Clooney), who seems to be a sex addict also addicted to exercise, and who also starts an affair with Linda, whom he has found on an online dating site. As all these characters are driven by their various anxieties and needs, confusion and havoc reign, as they should in farce, and I won't spoil you with details in case you haven't seen this yet.

Sometimes it can make one uneasy to see people making fools of themselves, but that's what you buy into sometimes with the Coens. But you also buy into crisp pacing, wonderful writing, and a high quality of performance. Also, in this movie, unlike ""The Big Lebowski,"" say, we tread on the verge of broad satire. Yes, the characters are stupid, but so is the CIA -- the idea of Washington types, especially National Security types, as not having a clue is very strong here, and that has some resonance with watchers in 2014, six years on from the movie's release. But the farce is the thing, and if your taste runs to that, and to fine acting, you will enjoy this movie.",1406073600,,3181,4.678571428571429

You know it is going to be a trainwreck, you see it coming, but it is so fun to watch it actually happen as all of the subplots come together at the finale'.

And the way that the stupidity is viewed at the highest levels of government seen in the film, with elegantly understated acceptance is outstanding.  J.K. Simmons is one of my favorite character actors and he is exceptional in a small part as the boss, and his final summation of the case is perfection!

The scene where Pitt and Clooney's characters meet is one of the most outrageous (and shortest) I have ever seen.  The look on Pitt's face is going to be with me for the rest of my life..

To get these many talented actors to play almost unbelievably stupid people with such realism - CLASSIC!  Malkovich is a hysterically pathetic character, a walking, talking, drinking Greek tragedy.  McDormand, Malkovich, Clooney, Pitt, are all embarrassingly believable.

If you don't love this film, you really need to take another look at it.  Seriously.  I loved it the first time, but really appreciated it more after watching it a couple more times.

I want to say so much more, but I'm afraid I'd be giving away too much of the plot.  Would love to discuss this with anyone who has seen it and not liked it, however.

Maybe -- just maybe -- it's you, who is too narrow-minded to understand why. Is it at all possible that all these bright people, who are quite well off professionally and financially would do a movie such as B.A.R. for the hilarious geniusness of it and because they would consider it worth their while?

Not so here - nothing remotely ""delightful"" about the slobs in this movie, except in their self-seriousness they are occasionally funny.  Brad Pitt is cute and dumb (what an acting stretch!), John Malkovich is surly and obnoxious (another acting stretch), George Clooney is sexy and promiscuous (yet another stretch), and Tilda Swinton is a cold, acid-tongued harpy (a 4th stretch).  Frances McDormand has managed to avoid such type-casting in her various roles. Here she is an agreeable but super-shallow and super-selfish health club employee who can't figure why her insurance company won't pay for the numerous plastic surgeries that she ""requires"" to ""reinvent herself,"" but the ticket to fast money just might be a CD found in the health club locker room, so she and dumb Pitt try to sell the ""secrets"" (which in fact are worthless) to the Russian embassy.  This plot line intertwines with the story of curmudgeon Malkovich quitting his job at the CIA, angering his money-loving wife (who is having a fling with the married Clooney, and so is every other woman in DC), who intends to divorce him once she gets a fix on his money situation.

These are NOT nice people, but for about 90 minutes they're rather enjoyable to watch, rather pathetic specimens of humankind, even tough Clooney, Swinton, and Malkovich move in the elite circles of Washington insiders.  McDormand's character gets most of the laughs, with her ""positive thinking"" approach to her ludicrous attempt to milk some money from the worthless ""secrets"" on the CD.  Everyone seems to be sleeping with everyone else, and McDormand meets Clooney (who takes off his wedding band) through a computer dating service, then the next day gushes to her boss about Clooney's ""sincerity.""

Early in the movie, Clooney reveals - twice - that he has carried a gun for 20 years but has never had a need to use it.  Obviously there comes a point in the movie where he finally gets to use the gun, a plot point I will not spoil, except to say that it is both funny and gut-wrenching.

This is not a movie for the kids, since roughly a third of Malkovich's lines are the F word, while Pitt seems fixated on the S word. There is a scene in Clooney's basement with a cleverly constructed ""pleasure chair"" which seems to add nothing to the plot, and I'm still puzzling over why the scene was included.  One of McDormand's dates keeps his glasses on while having sex (the best sex scenes in movies tend to be funny, not erotic).

If the federal government really does have people like this running the show, God help us all.  Watching these creeps for an hour and a half will probably make you feel really good about your job, your spouse, and your co-workers.",1384300800,,2831,4.776639344262295

The fact that Frances McDormand's character gets what she most wants in life--a liposuction paid for by her insurance--and gets it despite going to every bizarre extreme to obtain it, simply adds to this overall message.

The Coen Brothers made a good entertaining comedy, it stood the test of laughter, a good belly laugh.  It was true entertainment.  There is some intrigue, spouse cheating, investigations, the intelligence community, and a woman with a mission.

3594482,5,B001G0N22G,"""Burn After Reading"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: An ousted CIA official's memoir accidentally falls into the hands of two unwise gym employees intent on exploiting their find. From The Coen Brothers, the Oscar-winning masterminds behind ""No Country For Old Men"" (2007).

The story, screenplay, film editing (under the name Roderick Jaynes) and directing by Ethan & Joel Coen (who also are writing and directing the upcoming ""A Serious Man"" (2009), they also wrote and directed ""O Brother, Where Are Thou?"" (2000) (also film edited), ""Fargo"" (1996) (also film edited and won Oscar for Best Original Screenplay), ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998) (also film edited), ""Blood Simple."" (1984) (also film edited), ""The Ladykillers"" (2004) (also film edited), ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (2003) (also film edited), ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (2001) (also film edited), ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" (1994), ""Barton Fink"" (1991) (also film edited), ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990), & ""Raising Arizona"" (1987) is excellent!

The cast led by George Clooney (in his third movie with the Coens) (as Harry Pfarrer), Frances McDormand (Joel Coen's wife and frequent collaborator of the Coen Brothers, ironically won the Oscar for Best Actress in ""Fargo"") (as Linda Litke), John Malkovich (as Osbourne Cox), Tilda Swinton (won the Oscar recently for Best Supporting Actress in ""Michael Clayton"" (2007), which ironically also starred Clooney) (as Katie Cox), and Brad Pitt (Clooney's friend and frequent collaborator) (as Chad Feldheimer) is excellent!

The music by Carter Burwell (who has composed all of the Coen brothers' films to date, including the upcoming ""A Serious Man"") is excellent! The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (who recently did the cinematography to ""Children Of Men"" (2006, for which he was nominated for an Oscar for his work) is excellent! The casting by Ellen Chenoweth (who also did the casting for ""No Country For Old Men"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""Intolerable Cruelty"", ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", & ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", she also did the casting to ""Michael Clayton"") is excellent! The production design by Jess Gonchor (who also did the production design to ""No Country For Old Men"" & the upcoming ""A Serious Man"", he also did the production design to ""Baby Mama"" (2008) is excellent! The art direction by David Swayze (who also did the art direction to ""Baby Mama"", & the upcoming ""The Taking Of Pelham 123"" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Nancy Haigh (who also did the set decoration to ""No Country For Old Men"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""Intolerable Cruelty"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""The Hudsucker Proxy"", ""Barton Fink"", & ""Miller's Crossing"") is excellent! The costume design by Mary Zophres (who also did the costume design to ""No Country For Old Men"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""Intolerable Cruelty"", ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", & ""The Big Lebowski"", she also did the costume design to ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" (2008) is excellent!

3594492,3,B001G0N22G,"I've often thought that if you enjoy really weird movies, the Coen Brothers are hard to beat. In recent memory, I've watched ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men"" and enjoyed them both. However, both were very unusual and thought-provoking films. So, okay, I found a Coen Brothers comedy, ""Burn After Reading,"" in the five-dollar rack and just had to try it. A Coen Brothers comedy? The mind boggles at the thought. On the DVD front cover, it said ""A Comedic Masterpiece"" and ""Incredibly Entertaining."" That was my first sign that it probably wasn't all that good. My judgement was on the spot.

This movie was a comedy written about and for 40-somethings, people who have been out and about long enough that they are experiencing a lot of anxieties about  who they really are and what they're trying to do in life. Let's give them credit, the Coen Brothers have a sharp eye for those kinds of people and they painfully exploit it. The jokes are jokes, yes, but a lot of them have a razor-sharp cutting edge and their impact brings as much discomfort as laughter. Don't get me wrong, I like their ""eye of truth"" way of viewing the world. However, it turns the movie into part comedy and part very critical judgement of our society. That's all right, our society can use it. It's just that I was expecting something that was frivolous and hilariously funny and I got their jaundiced eye on life in the difficult forties. And, no, I'm not in my 40s. I'm 76.

The movie starts out with John Malkovich quitting the CIA in disgust at their policies and going through the experience by attempting to write an exposing-style book. The CDs of the writings together with some of the data on which the book is based are lost and then found by two employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) at a fitness center. These two numbskulls figure that it's some kind of lost secret CIA document that people might pay big money to get back. Before long, the original author, an ex-CIA officer, a Federal Marshall, The Russian Embassy and others are involved and Brad Pitt ends up dead and floating in Chesapeake Bay. It's hard to explain. Trust me. It's just about what you might expect to happen in Washington with everyone trying to keep their own rear end covered.

In any case,  did I find it a funny movie? No, not particularly. Was it an interesting movie? Yes, in a certain very bizarre sense. Was it a well done movie? Yes, exceptionally well done. The movie provided a strange and thought-provoking reaction, but I think an appropriate subtitle for the DVD might be ""Burn After Viewing.""

The movie is directed by the Coen brothers and stars Clooney, Pitt, McDormand, Malkovich and Swinton. What's not to like?

I'm hard to please when it comes to humor, but several Coen brothers films hit the spot. It's clever dialogue rather than slapstick physical humor, and some of it is unpredictable. I can't laugh when I see a joke coming from a mile away wearing a T-shirt with ""This is funny, laugh now"" written on it. I like to be surprised.

So what is surprising about Burn After Reading?

Harry Pfarrer (Clooney) has no redeeming features. He's married, but sees other women at every opportunity. He's having an affair with Katie Cox (Swinton). Harry is shallow, paranoid and somewhat stupid and Clooney plays the character with his usual charm and good humor.

If there is anyone dumber than Harry, it has to be Chad Feldheimer (Pitt), who works in a gym. Chad is a complete idiot in every way. His friend at the gym is Linda Litzke (McDormand), who is obsessed with undergoing cosmetic surgery to improve her appearance.

Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is married to Katie and works as an analyst for the CIA. Most of his sentences include at least one profanity and he's borderline alcoholic. The story begins with a meeting in which Osborne is told that he will be demoted, but instead of accepting the situation, he quits. Katie is not pleased, even though she's on the verge of leaving him for Harry.

There's not much of a plot. Chad acquires a CD containing the beginning of Osborne's memoir and believes it to be secrets of national importance. He thinks that Osborne is sure to give him a reward if he returns it and that leads to an amusing phone call. Linda decides that the Russians may be interested in the worthless CD and that they might reward her for the useless information.

Everybody seems to be sleeping with everyone else and what could go wrong does go wrong. This is not a serious story in any way.

There's a great cameo by J. K. Simmons who plays a CIA boss. He's utterly clueless about the significance of the events we witness because they are all meaningless. Watch his reaction at the end of the movie when he makes a decision about what further action to take.

Burn After Reading is a good way to spend an hour-and-a-half. No analysis is necessary. All of the characters have funny moments. Ignore the negative reviews and see it for yourself. You can pick it up for under $10 if you like it.

3594537,3,B001G0N22G,"Joel and Ethan Coen won the market on strange, off-centered movies that toss out bits and pieces of nonsense and lets the audience - and the obviously wildly entertained group of actors involved - put it together as best they can.  The Coen brothers have made some very fine films: this just isn't one of them.

What little plot there is pops along something like this: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an expert on Balkan affairs, is fired at the CIA: he begins writing a memoir of his past and his responses. His wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce and expects her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) - a philandering State Department marshal - to leave his wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Bouncing along to the next episode, a CD drops out of a gym bag at a Georgetown gym and employees Linda (Frances McDormand), an Internet obsessed date seeker,  and Chad (Brad Pitt) attempt to make it big by turning it into cash (Linda wants money for elective surgery, and Chad, a fluffhead goes along). Information on the CD leads them to Osbourne who declines to pay them for the CD so they visit the Russian Embassy as an option.  Linda and Chad decide they need more of Osbourne's secrets to enhance their 'valuable CD'. Bounce to another sidebar:  Linda's boss Ted (Richard Jenkins) likes her, and Harry's wife leaves for a book tour. The CIA (JK Simmons) is involved and the 'conspiracy' continues to blossom - all so that Linda can have plastic surgery to enhance her status on the Internet dating sites while her partner Chad just plods along in his own oblivious style for the ride.  Looking for a meaningful interconnected plot? Good luck!

The film lacks sensitive editing that would make it easier to follow the myriad subplots but then that is part of the Coen style.  The dialogue is full of puns - embarrassingly so - and instead of trying to make the film make sense it is better to just sit back and let the silliness of human foibles entertain. That is probably why so many of our top film actors sign on for Coen brothers film - to have fun and poke fun at not only the world we live in but also at us.

3594538,1,B001G0N22G,"Some years ago I was at a taping of a sit-com in Hollywood, and during a long lull in the action, the producers sent out a professional comedian to keep the audience in the mood to obey the huge LAUGH signs that stared at us like the muzzles of a firing squad. The comedian was a respected guy, a comedy-club-circuit regular who had appeared on talk shows and broadcast specials, and he immediately pitched into a very long, complex, involved joke about cancer. The joke wasn't funny, in fact it was confusing, depressing and somewhat tedious, but we all assumed the punch-line was there and would make everything we'd listened to over those long uncomfortable minutes of build-up retroactively hilarious.  Alas, we were wrong, and what we got instead of laughs was a sort of unintentional Grandpa Simpson imitation - a disjointed ramble of a story that goes nowhere and only makes you wish you hadn't started listening.

BURN AFTER READING reminded me strongly of this incident. The talent assembled is massive, all the ingredients for funny are in place, but funny never happens. Instead, you get two hours of depressing, squalid black humor from which the humor has been surgically removed, leaving behind a joyless, uncomfortable little movie that seems to want to laugh at the human condition but can't muster up more than a few sadistic grunts.

The movie's premise, which couples six degrees of separation with chaos theory, is as follows. An unhappy CIA analyst (John Malkovich) with anger issues quits his job and decides to write his memiors. Unbenknownst to him, unhappy British wife is cheating on him with a sleazy, self-involved ex-Federal Marshal played by George Clooney. The ice queen wants to divorce her husband and marry the already-married Clooney, so at the behest of her attorney, she steals what she thinks are his financial records of f his computer, only to lose them at a local gym. There, the records, which are actually the memiors and filled with secret information, are recovered by a submoronic personal trainer played by Brad Pitt, who takes them to his co-worker Frances McDormand. Frances is unhappy with her love life and takes to dating on the Internet, with depressing results. She is also unhappy with her body and wants plastic surgery, but can't get her HMO to pay, so she decides to blackmail Malkovich to get the money, with Pitt's help. At the same time, she takes up with Clooney, who despite his own marriage, and the fact he  has promised to divorce his wife and marry the British ice queen, is sleeping with everything under the sun. Thus everyone in the movie becomes linked to everyone else by circumstance, and without even knowing it, works at cross-purposes with greater and greater intensity until, whammo, people start to die.

If all this sounds convoluted, it is. In fact, there is a scene where a CIA man (David Rasche) tries to explain to his boss (J.K. Simmons) what the hell is going on with all these thefts, murders and blackmail schemes, and finds he can't do it - it is all too tediously inexplicable. But convolution is not the movie's real problem. What is wrong with BURN AFTER READING, aside from the glacial pace, is the way it tackles its subject matter. Black comedies, the Coen brothers specialty, depend on finding humor in horror, but in this movie there is neither humor nor horror, there are only a series of squalid vignettes that take the worst possible view of modern life and human nature. The scenes of McDormand trying to date via the Internet, or Malkovich trying to justify his decision to quit the CIA to his vegetative father while, unbeknownst to him, his wife is sleeping with someone else, are pathetic and depressing.  The ""running gag"" of watching Malkovich's neatly ordered life destroyed by divorce is about as funny as chemotherapy, and I'm sorry, but the fact the producers intended this to be funny doesn't make it so. The sole comic relief comes from Pitt, who plays a bumbling moron better than anyone in Hollywood, but this is hardly enough to justify watching the movie that, like a bad comedy routine, is long on discomfort and nonexistent on laughs.

PS - To the people who say I am missing the point by calling this film a bucket of chum, I suggest you take Animal Mother's advice from FULL METAL JACKET and flush out your headgear.  Seriously, how gullible are you? A bad movie doesn't get benefit of clergy because the producers INTENDED it to suck.",1310947200,5,4455,4.7992177314211215

So you have these frivolous people playing hard into their minuscule universe, leaving aside any sort of scruples.

But none of them are playing characters we really enjoy, let alone care about.

In fact, though many people promote this movie as being ""incredibly subtle and detail-oriented"" they cite reasons like ""a well-placed photograph of Vladimir Putin"".  Which is a nice touch, I agree.  It's just sad when those pieces are the only ones in the movie that are subtle.  Every piece of comedy in the movie that you don't have to look for to find is about as subtle as a smack in the face, and feels forced, fake, and uncomfortable.

Yes, Brad Pitt was funny.  In fact, I think he was pretty much the only likable character.  But when you're watching a movie that only has one likable character, and that character doesn't get the largest chunk of screen time, that usually makes the movie pretty miserable.

I realize that this movie is hilarious to others.  Personally, though, it's one of three movies that I will not only never watch again, but also wish I hadn't watched in the first place.",1292716800,,2299,4.54014598540146

This black comedy from the Coen brothers has an out of work CIA analyst (John Malkovich), who's wife (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce but is advised to copy her husband's personal and financial files first. The lawyer's secretary leaves the files at her health club and they are found by a trainer (Brad Pitt) who thinks that he can use them to blackmail the analyst. Linda (Frances McDormand), a fellow health club employee, takes the files to the Russian embassy in order to get them to buy the information so she can have cosmetic surgery. And a Treasury agent (George Clooney) carries on an affair with both the wife and the health club employee who wants cosmetic surgery.

3594555,5,B001G0N22G,"Joel and Ethan Coen make movies that are at right angles to most of the rest of Hollywood. Their dramas, going back to ""Blood Simple"", have a refreshing splash of humor, and their comedies, going back to ""Raising Arizona"", have dark elements. The Coen's are so adept at crossing stylishly from one genre to another it is no surprise that their grim Oscar-winning ""No Country For Old Men"" is followed by this delightfully twisted comedy.

I repeatedly find in Coen comedies characters who are not only entertainly dumb, but (as happens so often in real life, doesn't it?) unaware of their stupidity. (Think back to ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"") In ""Burn After Reading"" the Coens have assembled both performers and characters who are able to rip through a script that would be part hilarious and part ridiculous - ridiculous, that is, if it were not a Coen Brothers movie.

Brad Pitt appears prominently in the film's ad campaign (and he is sublime as an airheaded fitness trainer), but it would be difficult to say he is the ""star"", as a half dozen characters share as much screen time. John Malkovich brings an edgy profanity to his not-as-smart-as-he-thinks-he-is CIA analyst, who quits rather than take a demotion when his bosses confront him about his drinking problem. Tilda Swinton is superbly cast as his icy wife, not only reprising her White Witch character from ""Narnia"", but also her cold-blooded lawyer from ""Michael Clayton"". Swinton plays a pediatrician - the kind that makes children cry and doesn't care. Swinton is having an affair with ""Clayton"" co-star George Clooney, who once again expertly essays a Coen Clown, this time an ex government protection agent who ""never once discharged his weapon"" in years of service, but tells another character at a cocktail party that he could use his pistol if needed, because ""reflexes take over - it's all muscle memory"". (These reflexes complicate the plot in a way that can only be described as Coenesque.) Frances McDormand does much of her best work for husband Joel and brother-in-law Ethan (winning her Oscar in ""Fargo""), and here she gets a wonderful role as Pitt's dim-witted fitness center co-worker. McDormand has a poignant but funny early scene where she and a plastic surgeon (the extremely reliable Jeffrey DeMunn from ""The Green Mile"" and ""Law and Order"") discuss four separate operations she desperately wants - ""I've gone about as far as I can go with this body here..."" Richard Jenkins secretly pines for McDormand and tries to let her know he's interested even without the expensive surgery.

A MacGuffin is produced by the Malkovich character, who decides since he's left the CIA to write a memoir. The Swinton character copies Malkovich's computer files planning for divorce and wanting financial records, and the disc which incidentally includes Malkovich's memoirs is found at the gym where Pitt and McDormand work. Dimwit Pitt concludes that this CIA memoir is valuable spy stuff and he conspires with McDormand to offer the disc to the Russians to pay for McDormand's plastic surgery.

""The Russians?!"" J.K. Simmons asks in amused confusion as a CIA superior when he is informed by Malkovich's former boss, played by David Rasche. Although they appear only briefly, Simmons and Rasche produce a couple of the film's best scenes, including the side-splitting conclusion where the ""loose ends"" are tied as only the Coens can. I could say more, but that would deprive you of the pleasure of finding out for yourself.

From Pitt's best role since 12 Monkeys and Malkovitch's since almost well, maybe ever, the movie could have been something great.

In the story the violence is supposed to be ironic and comical but is treated with such a heavy hand by the Coen's to the point that the movie lurches to a conclusion. It's unfortunate that they didn't learn how much violence off screen can be just as effective from 'Old Men'.

Maybe the funniest thing about this movie is how many people didn't get it. The entire affair is an absurdist look at not only DC but self-obsession, political thrillers, middle age, and a host of other mostly modern ailments. Coen stalwarts McDormand and Clooney are excellent, but Malkovich and Pitt made me laugh the most, which was quite a lot.

Everything's perfectly deadpan, and if you don't appreciate laughing at yourself along with everyone else, BAR won't do it for you. A large slice of how we live is lampooned here, especially for those who've crested the 40-year hill and are gliding gracefully, or more likely not so, towards worm food status. Pitt seems to represent youthful obliviousness in general, and is the only character free of remorse or even self-inspection.

What I really loved about this film is that every single bit player is perfectly cast; all the government lackeys and CIA stooges are out to save their own butts first and foremost, and each actor seems exactly as selfish and myopic as they should be. The whole picture is painted so unflinchingly and yet with so much barely hidden glee that it all seems to get more weirdly funny as it goes on.

The Coens are in fine fettle here, and I rank this as very much one of their funniest, almost at Lebowski level. That worked by being over the top, and this works in precisely the opposite way. Its various overt subtleties seem to have escaped a large segment of the public and even Coen fans, judging from BAR's very mixed reception, but I think this one will age beautifully and eventually be seen as the twisted little masterpiece it is.",1270771200,2,1636,4.689895470383275
3594569,5,B001G0N22G,"The same repeated four-letter word that I eventually found tiresome in ""District 9"" is uncommonly effective in this film, allowing us to look inside characters whose pasts otherwise would suggest their differences are insurmountable to one another.  Yet each of these characters--from a former Greek orthodox priest to a rock-brained, uncoordinated ""Hard Body"" employee (Pitt) to a middle-aged bimbo (Francis McDormand) whose life would be complete with $25,000 for cosmetic surgery to Princeton graduates (John Malkovich) and over-sexed government operatives (Clooney)  to physicians to CIA brass--are recognizable, pathetic, self-centered human beings seeking satisfaction in the very places that destroy them.  It's a fallen world--not merely in need of redemption but of enlightenment and knowledge that can't be taught, even in a language more rich and expressive than the profane one they all embrace.

The closest character to a redemptive figure in this film, which I watched on Good Friday, is the former Greek orthodox priest (at a time when we hear of even higher percentages of deviant unholy celibates).  He alone acts for what he perceives to be the good of someone he genuinely cares about, and he alone would be the most likely candidate capable of receiving and reciprocating genuine love.  Yet in a world where selfishness and chance account for all human actions, the poor selfless priest doesn't have a prayer.  He's mistakenly identified as the wrong lover of the wrong woman, whom he tries to help, and he's spared from a fatal gunshot wound only because of the lousy aim of drunken ex-CIA agent John Malkevitch, who takes after him into the street with a tool and pounds him to death.

Doubtless, many negative ratings reflect the disappointment of fans of Pitt and Clooney, who play, against type, mindless dolts and 3rd-rate wife-swappers respectively.  Moreover, the Coen Brothers go to great lengths with make-up (or lack of it) to show that, as with the mono-vocabulary, these are limited beings, more grotesque than holy (more grotesque, in fact, than the thin-waisted aliens of District 9).

I'll admit that 5 stars is a bit generous, but the reviews of less than 4 stars stem more from extra-filmic concerns like Brad Pitt being snuffed with much film time remaining or George Clooney suddenly becoming decidedly non-genteel.  But this film is as much of a gem as--in some respects better than--""Fargo,"" more indebted to the master, Alfred Hitchock, than any other films in recent memory (it was Hitch who shocked and disappointed audiences throughout the world when he had his popular star erased in the shower scene half-way through the film).  But the shot setups, camera angles, lighting--they're all carefully planned and executed with the precision and cinematic know-how of Hitchock.

And though I don't wish to question ""Fargo""'s unique achievement, ""Burn After Reading"" goes further than the quaint regionalisms and unlikely protagonists of ""Fargo""  just as it surpasses any of the recent comic-book, overkill, shoot-em-up juvenilia of Quentin Tarentino.  The Coen brothers simply refuse to make concessions to the audience in terms of satisfying and titillating them with formula fairy tale stuff.  Instead, they construct a vision of life that, for all of its grim but frequently very funny impact (how can you help but not recognize your worst, duplicitous self?), is a vision of the human carnival, of an existential world devoid of the Hollywood-scripted absolutes and deus ex machina that amount to no more than fantasy and projection.

At the end of the tale, it is only Linda (McDormand) who realizes her dream.  We wish her well, knowing she's likely to be the worse for it.  But what none of us knows, including the characters and the head of the CIA, is how such a comedy errors--deadly, bloody, fatal ones--ever happened.  The CIA chief asks, ""What can we learn from this?""  Then, in his concluding remark, vows never to do it again. The only problem, he adds, is that he has no idea what they did.

Indeed, the Coen brothers seem to be saying, if Grace were ever needed for a world that can't get its act together, the time was never more critical than now.",1270166400,,4210,5.088662790697675

  I don't why people hated this film, I hope they weren't expecting a Michael Clayton or something like that. I saw many very intelligent actors and actresses supressing their intellects but not in a sad way. I haven't seen George Clooney's character this dumb since Brother, Where Art Thou.
  As for George Clooney's character, he is still a bit of a mystery. I have no idea what he wanted to achieve with all of his affairs and ""home projects."" I don't know why he finally used his weapon ""after 20 years of PP(People Protection) etc."" His sudden transformation after thinking the CIA was after him was almost out of character if I only knew what his character was.
  The over-dramatic soundtrack sounding at first like the Terminator theme of drum sticks on steel trash cans and the ""incoming data"" like blip of the scrolling credits can be disarming at first making you feel that you're stepping into a spy thriller (which, Frances and Brad's characters obviously thought they were) but it adds to the deep layer of satire that only the Coen Bros. are capable of.
  If you like cookie cutter characters with predictable plots, then this flick is not for you. If you like satire at the deepest level with all of our daily human faults exposed in a ""what if this guy I know at the gym is as dumb as he looks?"" way, then you'll not just like this film, you'll love it!",1263254400,2,2610,4.637744034707159

First of all, there is Frances McDormand.  I've loved her performances ever since I saw Fargo years ago.  In this film she plays the role of an aging gym instructor who doesn't have enough money for the cosmetic surgery which she is sure will help her land a man.  She's looking for love through the internet and the men she meets are all losers.  Another gym instructor, and her friend, is Brad Pitt, playing the part of a rather dense golden haired trainer.  One day they just happen to find a computer disk which looks like it has some secret CIA information on it.  The disk actually belongs to John Malkovich, who has been fired from the CIA and is writing a book about his experiences.  Whether the so-called secret information on the disk is actually real is always a question mark.  Malkovich is married to Tilda Swinton, a thin society type who is having an affair with George Clooney.  Clooney is quite a womanizer.  Even though he thinks he is happily married, there are several women in his life.  Frances McDormand becomes one of them.

The plot is so faced paced that I had no time to think.  But I did laugh a lot.  Every scene is stretched to its outrageous edge.  There's gunplay and murder throughout and most of the characters meet their end in some serendipitously outrageous way.  The conclusion is fun and satisfying even though most of the characters have been killed off.

3594591,4,B001G0N22G,"The Coens have done better (their best days seem behind them -- see my review of ""No Country for Old Men""), but ""Burn After Reading"" is still a clever and entertaining film.

It's not surprising so many viewers -- including too many reviewers, who ought to know better -- didn't like it, because it's little more than clever. As the brothers Coen admit, it was written specifically for some of their favorite actors, so you have to appreciate it on the level of an exercise in great acting.

Otherwise, there isn't much of a plot -- or a point. Just a bunch of foolish/dumb people getting into trouble. * This is also true of ""The Big Lebowski"", a much better, genuine-masterpiece film. Why it worked there and not here (just as ""No Country for Old Men"" failed to repeat the success of ""Fargo"", a virtually identical film) is not clear. **

Something should be said for Carter Burwell's excellent (and minimal) score. Though ""Burn After Reading"" is basically a ""black-screwball"" comedy, he scores it as a drama/suspense story. The main theme seems to be borrowed from ""The Isle of the Dead"", which seems appropriate.

If you're a Coen brothers fan, ignore the critics. You'll probably enjoy ""Burn After Reading"". But it's one of their lesser efforts.

PS: Am I the only viewer who noted that one of the victim's feet were splayed in a way that suggested the corpse of the Wicked Witch of the East?

* The issue of whether the Coens' tendency to portray human beings -- especially American human beings -- as fundamentally stupid will eventually be perceived as A Profound Comment on Society or self-serving elitism, is at least a decade or two away from being resolved.

** The reason is probably that ""Fargo"" and ""Lebowski"" had highly engaging central characters you got involved with.",1254528000,,1786,4.760517799352751
3594592,5,B001G0N22G,"Like ""Fargo"", the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" is one of their occasional productions that combines farce with drama, with neither aspect compromising or diluting the other.  While at first glance everyone here strongly defines themselves- in that very American way of looking at things- by their jobs (intelligence agent, gym employee, academic, etc.), the movie eventually makes it clear that we're all ultimately defined by our desires, lusts, and personal quirks.  It's these latter aspects of the characters that make them pursue increasingly crazy, though sadly still quite believeable, actions.

Frances McDormand is particularly good, both hilarious and chilling, as the gym employee who will do absolutely anything, without a shred of guilt (or even awareness that she should at least CONSIDER feeling guilty), to secure the cosmetic surgery she desperately wants.  Brad Pitt and George Clooney are terrific, too, with both again demonstrating some serious comic chops.

Both light and cutting, ""Burn After Reading"" is upper-tier Coen Brothers work and not to be missed.  The movie looks super sharp on standard DVD and features a handful of interesting behind-the-scenes extras, including generous interview material with both Joel and Ethan Coen.",1253664000,,1264,5.557291666666667

3594600,5,B001G0N22G,"Situations and characters in this comedic tale are peculiar yet believable, especially if you know anything about the CIA. The casting, acting and direction is superb, making these absurd characters and their actions seem perfectly plausible.

Some films are so unusual, they require multiple viewings to understand the writing genius and acting talent that made them. This is one of those. Think of ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Dr. Strangelove."" Now put those together. That's almost what this film is.

This comedy is perversely dark and so hauntingly humorous that it feels creepy.
The ""creepy factor"" is enhanced by cinematic contrasts. Bright lighting and ""sanitary"" suburban / corporate cleanliness of most scenes, opposed to the murky insidious actions of the plot. Brad Pitt plays a transparently inept dupe... the perfect foil to Malkovich's opaque-black character. (Emphasis on MAL-kovich) Brad is like a serving of low-fat vanilla ice cream, while Malkovich is a topping of salty Tobasco on top.

You can see that all the actors enjoyed their roles and were fully ""invested"". They make real movie magic here; not the visual trickery of Computer Generated effects, but the stunning interplay of experienced actors bringing vision and life to a twisted peculiar plot. They all take turns leading and supporting throughout. This cast ACTS together like seasoned Jazz musicians PLAY together.

The pace is never slow and every scene is important, so you have to pay attention. That's hard to do if you're stuck in the theater with clueless corporate lackies and dimwitted ""twitters.""

This film bears, or even requires several viewings to appreciated much of the humor. It helps if you watch it alone and undisturbed or with a like-minded movie fan. Still, it made my stomach hurt the first time I saw it in the theater... and that was under less than ideal conditions.

I had the misfortune of first seeing it in the theater with a bunch of ""bowling pins."" They just didn't get it. My ""dates"" for the evening kept looking at me like I was the one who was crazy. They felt embarrassed that I laughed so much and they couldn't understand why. I felt embarrassed to be in the same room with people who were so torpid. Though in a way, that made it even funnier. Really... I cried.

After the movie, we went to a restaurant / bar where we ate and talked about the movie. During that dinner, I learned something important...

This comedy is a litmus test for the viewer's social and political understanding. You can appreciate it solely for the minds that could conceive such a story, or the multiple talents that cooperated so flawlessly to realize the film. However, to really appreciate the humor, you have to know something about people and the way the world really works.

If you are not aware of how the CIA or other ""intelligence"" agencies operate,
if you don't know how some of the people who work for those agencies think,
if you don't realize just how stupid, shallow, vain and greedy some people can be,
...then the heady humor of this masterwork will evaporate into the aether before you can savor it.

I can recommend this film on multiple levels and for numerous reasons, but mostly for these two:
ONE--- PERENNIAL LAUGHS.
IF you ""get it"" you will laugh every time you see it for years. It will even make you laugh aloud for days afterwards at odd times  when you just happen to think about it.

TWO---LITMUS TEST.
IF someone does not ""get it"" then he / she needs to stop watching commercial television altogether. If anyone you know does not laugh at this movie, you cannot trust their opinions about any political or social issue. Their world-views and intellects have been severely attenuated. Really... I'm not kidding.

This comedy is a rare and exotic concoction... a unique recipe that only a few outliers will grasp. If you are one of them, it deserves a permanent place in your entertainment collection. If you are not one of them, buy a copy anyway. Someday, hopefully BEFORE criminal myopic madmen destroy us all, everyone will see.",1249603200,4,4054,4.857971014492754
3594601,4,B001G0N22G,"Burn After Reading turned out to be a real pleasant surprise for  me. I had no real interest in seeing it as I've slowly become less and less enthusiastic about new Coen films over the last few years and felt quite let down over No Country which I feel is overrated.

Still I rented it and am very glad I did. It's a typical Coen comedy with all the usual ingredients of silly / amusing characters, complex plotting and dark humour. It's not quite as zany or stylised as their earlier comedies like Raising Arizona or Hudsucker; here the characters are less cartoonish and the humour more sophisticated and in that respect has more in common with their more recent output like Big Lebowski, Intolerable Cruelty and Fargo.

It's also slightly more low key than usual Coen comedy fare but is still full of invention and has a number of brilliant laugh out loud moments, mainly due to the excellent comedic mannerisms of both Clooney and Pitt. Actually, I thought Pitt was excellent, very innocent and lovably innocuous and his scenes where he tries to fish for a reward are pure comedy gold!

Burn After Reading is the Coens on form for me, and it shows in the details. For example, who else would bother to make what could have been a rather mundane scene such as Pitt's character hanging out in a car waiting for a couple to leave their house, so subtly hilarious and memorable - again kudos to Pitt. When Pitt is inside the cupboard getting increasingly anxious, if you listen carefully, you can actually hear him wheezing! Hilarious! Again, the first encounter with the divorce lawyer (J.R. Horne), a short scene but made so fun because Horne was brilliantly funny and a typical Coen invention. There are so many comedic flourishes littered about, some very subtle, others more overt and in the end, it all rounds off to a very satisfying 90 minutes.

There is a definite undercurrent of condescension which may be off putting for some though. You get the people at the top (here portrayed by the CIA and Russian embassy staff) being interrupted by these silly middle-aged people with their foibles, trying to make sense of all their shenanigans which in the end amount to nothing. Then of course you get Malkovic's speech at the end. It's difficult to say whether this is the Coen's showing a general disdain for people or whether it's them making fun out of their own middle-agedness. It's hard to say but either way, it's helped them fashion another comedic gem!",1249603200,,2467,4.688221709006928

The writer has no clue whatsoever how to write a story that has any point, unless the point is that life is so random that any efforts have no effect on the outcomes and we are doomed to our fate.  Perhaps that is the intended dark message of this film, but the point could have been made in a 5 minute short rather than promising to deliver in a full-length feature than just ending with the intelligence service looking like guys from Get-Smart and everyone else just in it for themselves with ridiculous outcomes.

Thus, this film is completely without redeeming values on any level, but for study of character development, directing, and editing technique.

I believe that Burn After Reading will be seen in this same light 10 years from now.  It is a brilliantly written, unpredictable and suspenseful comedy that features the best of everything that we have come to expect from the Coen Brothers.  It has the quirky, witty lines of dialog, the non-formulaic plot, and the social commentary that nobody else has been able to consistently put into their films.  This film is highly entertaining on its first viewing, but it is also incredibly rich, with lots of details and themes that make it entertaining the 2nd, 5th, and 10th time that you see it.

The cast for this movie is nearly perfect.  Tilda Swanton and John Malkovich appear in their stereotypical roles of ""snooty, cold bitch"" and ""angry intellectual elitist"".  Frances McDormand are as funny as ever and Brad Pitt does a great job of playing a complete airhead, a totally new role for him.  As usual, the Coen brothers get great performances out of everyone.

It's impossible to list and describe all of the threads in this movie with a short review.  Long time Coen Brothers fans will recognize some of the themes here, like male gender role inadequacy and how it negatively influences a marriage.  Characters look like idiots when they try to sound smarter than they actually are, and they jump to conclusions with limited data.  Chaotic hilarity then ensues when these characters interact but can't actually communicate with each other.  Linda Litski (McDormand) and Osborne Cox (Malkovich) are two characters who live almost in an alternate reality and thus react with emotional denial to anything bad that happens to them.

This movie certainly has a ""Big Lebowski"" vibe to it, but it is also unique in a lot of ways.  As a subtle spoof of spy thrillers like the Bourne movies, it is brilliant.  The CIA and Washington DC are the backdrop for a bunch of unlikeable characters who lie and deceive to various people to get what they want.  Husband and wife engage in ""espionage"" while dramatic music plays in the background.  The movie constantly uses spy movie clichs like camera shots that make you look like the characters are being watched from a distance, and suspicious surveillance vehicles that appear at regular intervals.

Most of the Coen Brothers previous works have been set in relatively small or remote areas.  This is the first one to be set in Washington DC.  The result is some scathing satire of government beauracracy and the Washington DC culture.  Just about everyone is portrayed as vain, shallow, and self-centered.  The characters who work for the government have vaguely defined jobs that make you wonder if they have any actual value or if they are just collecting a check.  In two of the movies funniest scenes, two CIA beauracrats are discussing the major events of the movie with indifference, talking about deaths and tragedies as if they are minor inconveniences to be swept under the rug.  These scenes chillingly show the manner in which beauracracy operates primarily just to preserve itself.

This is my favorite Coen Brothers movie, and I can't recommend it enough.  This movie is incredibly underrated and has been mistakenly dismissed as being mediocre.  The brothers' brand of misanthropic comedy fits perfectly into this setting, and the result is one of the funniest movies of this decade.",1247097600,,3522,4.873949579831932
3594611,4,B001G0N22G,"In Washington, D.C., a group of seemingly unrelated characters and a tangle of subplots makes for an entertaining, if lightweight, star-studded comedy with tragic overtones.  A CIA man (John Malkovich) gets fired while his wife (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with a playboy (George Clooney); an insecure woman (Frances McDormand) and her dippy co-worker (Brad Pitt) find the CIA man's memoir and try to peddle it to the Russians.

This film has all the delightful earmarks of a typical Coen Brothers film:  It's full of ordinary, somewhat dim characters, greed has a major role, the dialogue is often hysterically funny, and things get quickly out of hand and disaster ensues.  The casting is typically odd; Clooney is made out to be a pretentious and rather unsavory guy despite his charisma and Pitt is a foolish simpleton.  McDormand is wonderful as the naive middle-ager who gets mixed up in international affairs, and Malkovich is manic and off-kilter as usual.

We loved ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" and hoped this would be of equal quality. Like a previous reviewer, we kept watching, hoping it would get better, but it just got worse, and fast. I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to warn others about this movie.

SPOILER ALERT: The trailer and clips had almost all of the good clips, which happen in the first part of the movie. It starts out as off beat and quirky and moves along well. [Be warned, there is an exceptional use of the ""F"" word from the very first scene]. Then it just turns mean and violent. One of the main characters, unexpectedly, has his head blown off and another gets shot and then has a hatchet taken to him. Then, it has a weak ending, almost like a throw off scene. This movie is NOT what it appears in the trailer or previews.

One way we judge a film is if we really like or ""root for"" any of the characters. In the end, there are no really likable characters in the movie and we didn't root for them. We just disliked them. Granted, this has a terrific cast. But if you want to see a movie that Hollywood loves, and demonstrates how out of touch they are with regular ""people"", then this is it. It's as if they made it for themselves so they could sit around and pat each other on the back. Yeah, one might call it a dark comedy, but it is not in the same league as others of this genre.

It's a dark/screwball comedy that does go over the top, but is completely comfortable in its absurdity. The Coen Brothers said they wanted this to be their ""Tony Scott movie."" Well (different genres aside), it's better than most Tony Scott movies.

The film grabbed my attention immediately in the brilliant opening scene where Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst, is told he is being demoted to a lower clearance level as a result of his ""drinking problem."" Seeing this as a political crucifixion, Osborne quits his job and decides to pen an ""explosive"" memoir. George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a U.S. Marshal who works in the Treasury Department. Harry is happily married to a children's book author, happy to point out he has ""never fired his gun in 20 years of Marshal Service,"" and is having an affair with Osborne's wife Katie (Tilda Swinton).

Frances McDormand plays Linda Litzke, a loudmouthed, nave gym employee looking for love...And a way to pay for all the plastic surgery procedures she wants. Linda works with Chad (Brad Pitt), a gum-chewing, clueless simpleton who works Linda at Hardbodies gym. When Chad finds a disc that seems to contain Osborne's memoirs, the two decide to bribe Osborne for some money to return his ""intelligence s***."" Richard Jenkins co-stars as Ted, the nervous, insecure manager of Hardbodies.

Few movie character's need you to use two adjectives when describing them. These characters do...All are multi-dimensional, bumbling idiots that don't feel like ""written"" idiots. The Coen's wrote these characters specifically for the actors that play them and each actor (knowing they're not shooting for an Oscar) has a blast playing they're character. The Coen Brothers have always excelled at creating memorable film characters, but I found their creations here some of their most memorable and easily some of their funniest.

Much of the credit goes to the actor's, two I'll talk about specifically. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, and Frances McDormand are all Oscar winners; both have played this character before. Clooney is hilarious and has received his fair share of attention for this role. It's nice to see a serious actor not being afraid to let loose. Swinton has also played this character before; as the most humorless character in the film, it's not even much of a stretch from her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Clayton-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00121QGPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;character. And McDormand is great as always, especially in movies directed by her husband Joel Coen. The characters she plays in Coen movies always seem to be adored by their creator(s) and usually have the happiest ending. This is no exception.

The two actors' that really stand out, for me, are John Malkovich and Brad Pitt. I love Malkovich and will watch any movie he's in. Anyone who's seen a Malkovich film has probably noticed that he has one of the most commanding, attention-grabbing voices especially when he's yelling. The Coen Brothers seem to have noticed, as they wrote this part specifically for him and I think there are two or three scenes where Malkovich isn't yelling. This is a great comedic performance. Not just because Malkovich is a revered actor of film and stage, as he's had no problem breaking away from type in the past...But he's absolutely fascinating, empathetic, and hilarious. People tend to say that Osborne is the most intelligent character, but as the tagline of this film said: ""intelligence is relative."" Osborne is smart, but like all the people in this film has their idea of what's going on all wrong. Even the smartest character in this film lacks common sense. You laugh at Osborne, but you feel a bit bad for the guy too.

Brad Pitt, an underrated actor, comes out of nowhere with his performance as Chad. I know people who won't see a Pitt film, but he steals the show here! Not only that, he's created one of the most brilliant character's of his career. He disappears into the role of Chad, bringing such an energy and hilarity to his role. In character, Pitt saying the word ""s***"" can cause you to cry tears of laughter.

The confrontation between Chad and Osborne in the car is a perfect example of the comedic genius of the script and the great comedic timing of the actors. Everything about this scene is ingenious from Pitt's squinty eyes, to the expletive-filled exchange between the two, and finally to ""you think it's a Schwinn!""

Anyway, as for the rest of the film; the dialogue is brilliantly written. There are lines in this film that you will very likely remember for a long time. There's quite a bit of swearing in the film, but it never feels gratuitous. If not further the development of the characters, I find that no one can say the ""f-word"" like Malkovich can. The musical score is your typical ""spy movie"" music that works so wonderfully here, adding to the absurdity of the film and seemingly remarking on the false tension that these ""spy thrillers"" attempt to build.

Burn After Reading is a screwball comedy, Coen style. It's a film that takes nothing seriously and, at a 92-minute running time, only has scenes necessary to the plot. Before you disagree, there are scenes that seem to have no place in the film whatsoever. If this film wasn't as ludicrous as it is, they wouldn't. However, even the scenes that don't seem to have any relevance add to sheer randomness of this film. And it is random; the Coen's have no problem leading the film is one direction only to jerk it into completely different one moments later.

Many people have rejected this film. All Coen Brothers films have their detractors, but this one seems to be taking a lot of heat. I honestly can't understand why. The Coen Brothers have always made films like this, but this is distinctly different from any previous comedy efforts...And it IS better than their last comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ladykillers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00029LNYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ladykillers (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

The script seems to get the biggest amount of complaints. The first time I saw the film (I've seen it four times now), I had no idea what was going on and I was wondering where this movie was going. What was the point? The two scenes that J.K. Simmons is in sum up the entire ""point"" of the movie. Is the plot ""contrived?"" Yes. Does the film seem to be going nowhere throughout? Yes. If you paid attention to the (hilarious) scenes with Simmons, you should realize that the entire point of the film is that there really isn't one. The characters have as good of an idea as you do about what's happening. It has a central conflict that is really not of much importance and the rest of the film is the hilarious situations that come from this conflict. I don't see how even people who disliked the film can't admire the brilliance of the plot structure.

Burn After Reading is the most inventive, unique comedy of 2008. I really love this movie. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect, and it's not one of the best Coen Brothers movies. But it's a very intelligent comedy with great characters and witty dialogue that is absolutely bursting with creative energy.

How can you dislike a movie that can be summed up with one word; ""clusterf***.""

3594625,3,B001G0N22G,"It would be impossible to get through a review of a Coen Brothers movie without using the word 'quirky' more than once, but I will strive to do so. ""Burn After Reading"" is a mildly amusing spy farce that gets by mainly on the strength of the stars, especially Brad Pitt, playing way against type. Everyone is in bed with each other, and only Frances McDormand seems less than madly paranoid. But that is only because she is oblivious to everything except her goal of plastic surgeries.

Her target is suddenly in view when she and Chad (Pitt) find a computer disc containing the files of one Ozzy Cox, an alcoholic ex-CIA agent who decides to write his ""explosive memoir."" The clueless duo think Cox's disc actually contains government secrets, and decide to blackmail Ozzy. Clooney is having an affair with Ozzy's wife. Linda is using computer dating and hooks up with Clooney. Clooney and Pitt have an encounter that ties them to Linda in an unfortunate manner. Ozzy's wife is spying on Ozzy, but Clooney thinks they're following him. Pitt thinks the government is chasing him for the ""Secrets,"" and Ozzy is falling deeper and deeper into a drunk funk. Meanwhile at the CIA, Ozzy's disc has set things into motion that a hapless JK Simmons keeps getting debriefed on but can't keep track of.

And if the head of the CIA can't follow them, it might just be hard for mere viewers. ""Burn After Reading"" is a labyrinthine 90 minutes with several spikes of wicked humor but also a caper-load of mugging. Malkoviich's Ozzy Cox is the same intense crank you've seen him do a million times, and Clooney is an obsessive womanizer with way too many tics. Pitt and McDormand make the most of their empty-headed schemers, and in a minor role, Richard Jenkins is likely the most sympathetic characther in the whole film.

Even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski/dp/B001AEF6D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski</a>, arguably one of their most absurd works, had a lot to say about the way honest laziness can sometimes thrive in spite of the malicious excesses of those who are more powerful and harder working.

""So, what did we learn?"" asks a CIA official at the end of BURN AFTER READING.  Well, let's see.

The film begins with CIA analyst Osborne Cox (a spot-on Malkovich) being demoted due to alcoholism.  Cox, rather than be disgraced, quits and begins work on his memoirs (between drinks).  The CIA keeps tabs on him, and around him suddenly swirls a mess of senseless intrigue that involves a twitchy sex addict who works for the Treasury (George Clooney), a vain and desperate gym employee (Frances McDormand), and her clueless (but Can Do!) buddy, Chad (Brad Pitt).  When Cox's memoirs make their way into McDormand's hands, she sees a way to solve her woes by blackmailing the analyst into paying for a bevy of cosmetic surgeries.

Aside from the typically convoluted plot, the film is a dark and dead-pan comedy about how the frailties of adulthood (alcoholism, sexual indiscretions, blind personal vanity) can alter the lives of people who deserve much better.  Looked at from head-on, the movie is sorta depressing, even though many of the characters get exactly what they're looking for.  That's, of course, not really the point.

Near the end of the film, analyst Cox confronts a person who has become involved in the plot to use his memoirs for personal gain.  ""You represent the idiocy of this world,"" he sneers.  Making sense of idiocy is something the Coen brothers have been doing for a long, long time, and even if the government agents keeping tabs on all the lies and greed-grubbing don't do such a good job of learning from the craziness, that doesn't mean an astute viewer can't find something to take away from the theatre.",1238716800,8,2725,5.344262295081967

3594651,2,B001G0N22G,"The Coen Bros. have pretty much made their mark on film. They have been nominated for best picture for 'Fargo', created one of the greatest cult classics in 'The Big Lebowski and got Oscar gold with 'No Country For Old Men' The Coen Bros are the epitome of originally and dry comedy and know how to use their actors both well known and unknown. Then there is 'Burn After Reading'. The Coen Bros. do it again, great cast, very dry humor and pure originality. Still, with 'Burn After Reading' it's very hard to finish that movie satisfied, because you wonder if it made any sense at all.

From what I was able to make out of it John Malcovich brilliantly portrays a recently fired government agent, who decides to write a book. His information, somehow ends up in the hands of two yokel gym instructors played brilliantly by Francis McDormand and Brad Pitt (In my opinion this is his greatest comedic role since True Romance) Now the movie has become a game to retrieve the disc of information while everyone is sleeping with everyone and everyone is looking over their shoulders thinking someone is watching them. Even in the end when this case is brought to light to the head of this mysterious organization which is pretty much in the background of the whole film he can't even figure out what the hell is going on.

I had high hopes for this movie. I did feel the cast did a great job, which is why I gave this movie two stars. I have become a big fan of Tilda Swinton since I saw her in Narnia. I feel she has great potential to become a real legend in her field. She already won an Oscar along side George Clooney. George Clooney, I really didn't get in this movie. I mean he knows how to work his role, but in this film I really didn't understand what he was there for. This movie itself just keeps you asking questions and probably the biggest question of all you will have is...how in God's name did I manage to sit through this movie? I would just watch The Big Lebowski again, at least with that movie The Dude abides.",1236988800,2,2027,4.388297872340425

The frustrations come through, but the plot is rather thin.  Can rage alone carry this group of stars to the end?

Enter Brad Pitt as Chad, the perfect trainer for any private gym and fitness center. He is dealing with some serious CIA-type stuff, but with a smile, tons of charm and an eternal optimism, just like most of us have first thing in the morning, until we hear the latest national and international economic news.

Pitt does not take much seriously, right through the story and well there are consequences.  But he (maybe) reads the greed and rage in those around him who have absolute zero sense of humor.

3594659,5,B001G0N22G,"The reviews have been mixed, and I'm not at all surprised.  BURN AFTER READING won't be everybody's cup of Gatorade, but if you're one of the many naysayers who claim to find the film a major letdown after last year's officially designated Best Pic NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, well, let me just say, I do understand your point.  But has it occurred to you that maybe you're less of a COEN BROS. fan and more of a CORMAC McCARTHY fan?

Yes, yes, I know that NO COUNTRY was supposed to be a case of the source material (the McCarthy novel of the same name) being the perfect fit for our two most idiosyncratic filmmakers, and in many ways, it was just that.  But there was one significant difference, in my book anyway.  And that was the person(?) of Anton Chigurh himself.  We all know by now that Chigurh is quite simply the personification of implacable evil, less of human being than a force of supernature.  And like a malevolent phoenix, he rises from the ashes more than once.  One thing he's NOT is a bumbler.  In that, he differs from just about every other Coen ""bad guy,"" or for that matter, just about every other major Coen character.

Heck, even the seemingly invincible biker dude in RAISING ARIZONA turned out to be Wile E. Coyote in the end.

I know the Brothers don't particularly like to be intellectualized about, but if there's one common theme uniting all their work, it's probably that the entire human race is the Gang That Could't Shoot Straight.  In the Coen's universe, we're all bad comic actors strutting and fretting for about 90 minutes on atarnished silver screen. Good guys or bad, small or mighty, it don't make no never mind. Usually, just like in real life, the misterioso elements that do occur (a cow on a barn, say) are just enough for us fools to scratch and wonder if just maybe there aren't more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt in our philosophy...OR our cinema.  Or my name isn't Horatio!

If you keep the Coens' basic worldview in mind, you just may find that BURN AFTER READING is a near perfect expression of same.  This is an absurd world where EVERYBODY is out of their league.  And they've all watched too many spy movies.  Even the spies--who really should know better.  When John Malkovich--being the quintessential John Malkovich here--rails at Brad Pitt's buffoonish would-be blackmailer/""Good Samaritan"" and tells him that he (Pitt) has no idea what he's up against, he's so into his espionage mode that you might forget for a second that he's just a (fired) CIA analyst penning what appears to be a not very revealing tell-all.  In other words, this is not ""spy vs. spy.""  It's ""schlub vs. schlub.""

I watched the movie with two friends when about half way through all three of us were scratching our heads wondering how the writer/s had gone so terribly wrong.
The actings was great. None of us had any gripes in that department but the storyline got out of control and soon, anything that was remotely interesting about the characters in the movie seemed overshadowed by the various outrageous amounts of idiot antics that each and every character was stuck having to act out.
And a question here: WHO in their right mind would find a computer CD with classified info on it and then, when trying to blackmail the owner of the material, would be offended that the victim was a bit ""peeved"" (to put it mildly) about being blackmailed??
It was at that time in the film when all three of us knew, ""It's all downhill from here.""
And we were right.

His wife wants a divorce and expects her lover, Harry, a philandering State Department marshal, to leave his wife. A diskette of Osbourne's musings falls out of a gym bag at a Georgetown fitness center. Two employees there try to turn it into cash: Linda, who wants money for elective surgery, and Chad, an amiable goof. They try to sell the disc back to Osbourne, who has a short fuse, then they visit the Russian embassy. To sweeten the pot, they decide they need more of Osbourne's secrets. Meanwhile, Linda's boss likes her, and Harry's wife leaves for a book tour. All roads lead to Osbourne's house.

3594686,1,B001G0N22G,"So, yesterday afternoon I watched the dvd of Burn Before Reading that I had gotten used via Amazon.

I think I paid too much.... because it wasn't worth the time or effort to get it nor to watch it. The Cohen brothers once again struck out with a 'Comedy' that wasn't funny, based around some pretty pathetic characters that were played by some great actors who must not have been allowed to read the entire script before shooting.

That, or the cutting room floor got all the jokes and the details of the plot, because they aren't in the movie.

There are a handful of plot hooks, mostly based off a series of pathetic coincidences and horribly illogical decisions. There's really not one likable character in the bunch as they are all pretty bad stereotypes that should not have been reused anywhere.

This disc is going on the pile of things that will not stay in my house. I'm a forgiving guy. I can dig 'black comedy' like Fargo, for instance, but this was pathetic.

It was like ""Look I have a shoebox with a bunch of characters that we created and tossed out of our other film ideas... let's throw them together somehow and make a film. We'll get some famous actors drunk in an orgy and use it to blackmail them to play the characters in the movie, because if we give them the script before hand they'll run for France or something to escape us.""

Yeah, it's that kind of film. I don't want to know how they blackmailed the critics that raved about it in the promos and on the advertising.

It really should have been burned... before distribution.",1234483200,5,1555,4.4734982332155475
3594687,3,B001G0N22G,"I think it's pretty well decided on that the Coen brothers produce movies you either love or hate.  They have their very own style and they continue to stay true to that style; but like anything or anyone, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  `Fargo' works, as does `No Country for Old Men'; two films that couldn't be any more different yet are surprisingly very much the same.  My love affair with the Coen's has been spotty to say the least.  I usually tend to adore their more prestigious work, yet I find myself distanced from their more commercial outings (the fact that they actually directed `Intolerable Cruelty' makes me rather sick).

I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  It looked rather funny when I saw the trailers, but the film received such awfully sub par reviews that I was nervous.  Then awards season rolls around and it pops up on the NBR's top ten, and then it starts snagging Globe and BAFTA nominations and I'm scratching my head thinking `this wasn't supposed to be that good'.

I finally saw it.

It wasn't that good.

Okay, here's the problem; it's not `that' funny.  Here's another problem; it's not `that' intelligent.  Everyone prides the Coen's on their clever mix of humor and brains, making very adult, very mature and very intelligent comedies.  This one isn't really funny or smart.

The film tells a convoluted (but it's not as `twisty, turny' as it thinks it is) tale of CIA analyst Osbourne Cox who has recently been fired.  Under emotional stress he decides to take time to write his memoirs.  Meanwhile his wife Katie is having an affair with Harry Pfarrer, a federal marshal married to a children's author.  Urged by her lawyer to get a copy of her husband's financials before pursuing divorce, Katie accidentally copies his memoirs and when they wind up laying around on a gym changing room floor two airheads think they've stumbled onto some secret CIA `stuff'.  Attempting to blackmail Cox into paying over some much needed cash, these two nitwits wind up getting mixed in some serious `stuff'.

The film is very easy to follow, despite all the characters and plot twists.  Like I said, they're not as convoluted as they think they are being.  As far as the acting is concerned, it is really sporadic.  Some of it is great, some of it is bland and some of it is horrendous.

Brad Pitt is comedic genius here, playing the densest character in the bunch.  This allows him to just create a purely comedic character, with no baggage or additional strings to pull.  He's just funny, and he should have had a lot more screen time.  Richard Jenkins is also very endearing and stands out amongst the rest of the cast, mainly because he's the only character who isn't an idiot.

That's another problem with this movie.  There is really not one intelligent person in the entire film.  Everyone you meet is dumber than the last person you met, so they all wind up being just as ridiculous as the last.  A few morons sifted into a comedy can help pepper in the fun a bit, but when there is not one person who seems remotely intelligent it can make for a rather uninteresting time.

George Clooney is very over the top, as is John Malkovich, but Malcovich handles his characters emotional deterioration much better than Clooney.  Clooney just comes off like a moron; Malcovich elevates his characters moronic status, if that makes any sense.  Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton have both received nominations for their performances but I fail to see why.  I somewhat can see the Swinton love a bit, for she is rather good with what she is given (which isn't much mind you), but McDormand is in my opinion `worst in show'.  I just didn't get what she was doing.  I love her, don't get me wrong.  She is usually one of my favorite actresses, but she just was not funny here, and she was obviously trying very hard to be.

In the end I just cannot get behind this one.  It has its moments (every one with Pitt is really hilarious) but as a whole it just doesn't work as well as it should have.  I'd give it a C, but Pitt is a remarkable A+.",1234483200,2,4090,4.5722145804676755

3594690,4,B001G0N22G,"This is a strange but wacky dark comedy - and the best I can come up with a plot is that Liposuction should be covered by insurance or you come up with all kinds of unintended consequences.  It is a story of a desperate woman Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand)  who blackmails to find the money to be ""reinvented"" with liposuction!

Also - it was kind of sad - the many cheating wives and husbands who made this a dark and meandering tale.  But without a lot of the complexity developed from a simple wish to have a beautiful body - the ending could not have been as hilarious.  A real spoof on how one senseless thing leads to another.

""Burn After Reading"" suggests this is a spy caper and it is in a strange way.  The movie starts when the long-time CIA analyst Osborn Cox (John Malkovich) is fired without good reason and he starts work on a ""tell all book"" of the CIA.  The CIA Analyst's spouse downloads information from Osborn's computer to prepare for divorce.  She thinks it is mainly financial information and does not want to be cheated out of her share.  Somehow the CD ends up at the Hard Body Gym, where Frances McDormand (Linda Litzke), a love-starved aging employee, and Brad Pitt (Chad Feldheimer) a personal trainer, who is a good friend find it and see there may be a way to use it for money through blackmailing Osborn Cox.

Linda's search for love continues with on-line dating ""meet-ups""  and her constant calls to the insurance company to complain that the four procedures she needs are not elective - they are important to her life and career.  The procedures should be paid for.  They aren't.  George Clooney (Harry Pfarrer) is one of her ""dates"" - but he also married and is carrying on an affair with Osborn's wife.  He is a ""cheater"".  As an aside - it shows him building a sex machine with Home Depot materials.  When completed, Linda is given a demo of sorts.  So many boring lives and such a need for excitement is one of many sub-plots.

There are many dire consequences from the Blackmail attempt, as well as visits by Linda and Chad to the Russian Embassy to try and sell the CD for money.  The Russians seem skeptical.

The CIA is following as their ""mole"" in the Russian Embassy alerts them of the attempt to sell information - but they are puzzled about the whole reason for doing it?

I've seen Burn After Reading several times now, and I've loved it every time. The acting is absolutely great, the script is brilliant, and the viewer is expected to actually get something out of the movie. This movie isn't necessarily meant to be a rip-roaring comedy (in my opinion), but rather a darkly humorous social critique embedded in a somewhat complex story. The characters in this movie, I think, could be better understood as caricatures who embody elements of contemporary society rather than actual real-life people.

Anyhow, this is just pure genius by the Coen Brothers. But hey, that's what we expect from them. One of the top five movies of '08, in my opinion.",1233792000,18,930,4.955128205128205

Burn After Reading has a whole array of problems, but here is a list of what comes to mind.  First and foremost, everyone tries WAY too hard to be funny and quirky.  Whenever you notice each and every character doing a ""look at me, look at me"" against every other character, that's not a good sign.  Plus, there isn't a single likeable character.  There's no one you can ""root for.""  Even the one character you thought you could root for, ends up being just as horrible as the rest of them.  They're just all horrible people and you don't want any of them to succeed in any way.  Also, Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are just WAY too stupid for words.  I know they're supposed to be, but this is just annoyingly so.  It's not really funny, just annoying.

The only reason I'm even giving this two stars instead of one, is simply because of a few scenes.  There are a few standout scenes that float to the top and are actually pretty funny.  I don't want to ruin it, if you're actually going to watch this, but a few are good.  Plus, anytime JK Simmons is on screen, you realize how fantastic that guy really is.  Pity he's only in it for about 5 minutes total.  He also makes you realize just how much the other actors are waaaaaaaay overacting and mugging for the camera.

Overall, as a Coen brothers fan, I was sorely disappointed.  Go re-rent Raising Arizona, Big Lebowski or Fargo again instead.  You'll be doing yourself a favor.",1233792000,6,1709,4.427652733118971

This film requires patience:  because all of the plot parts are going to be interwoven at one point, and you have to pay strict attention to every detail, and everything that is ever said by any character, such as a boast by George Clooney that figures hilariously later on in a key scene in the movie ( the closet scene ).

3594699,4,B001G0N22G,"Burn After Reading is another Cohen brothers film. After last year's award winning No Country for Old Men (which I haven't seen), they return to comedy with a spy thriller that features, instead of covert CIA agents and national secrets, a bunch of buffoons.

The first thing you'll notice before you get into the purpose and intent of the film is the music and filming techniques. It is straight spy thriller stuff. Suspensful music, framing shots you'd expect in a Bourne or Bond film. Then you begin to realize that all the characters are morons. The great cast begins with John Malkovic as Oswald Cox, a midlevel CIA agent who quits his job instead of accepting a reassignment. He decides to write his memoirs. Those memoirs end up in the hands of two Hardbodies gym employees Linda Litzke and Chad Feldheimer (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt). They think they are in possession of some top secret information, and they will do anything to turn the ""top secret"" info into money.

George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a treasury department official who thinks he has his wife fooled that he is a good husband. While his wife is away, he is sleeping with Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton), Oswald's wife. He also is on an internet dating service and mees Linda Litzke. The movie ends with all the characters and story lines interacting in a crazy way.

This movie really has no plot, in that there is no final objective. The movie instead has fun with the spy thriller genre and explores what would happen if the dumbest people in the world thought the were dealing with some top secret information.

This movie isn't for everyone. There is a lot of foul language and a few scenes of gruesome violence. But that is expected in a ""R"" movie. All the great actors in the film play against their normal on-screen personal. They aren't sexy or smart or smooth. They are just dumb.

""Burn After Reading"" has been ""read"" a number of ways: a spoof of the intelligence community (my call on the funniest part of the film), a social commentary on extra-marital and internet affairs, and a poke at mid-life crises. Let me add one more dimension to this adept Coen Brothers film of masterful ensemble acting: the apparent inability for one human to really know another, resulting in superficial intimacies.

People are who they are. Even if they switch their partners, they still are who they are. Case in point: Tilda Swindon plays a cold, haughty type with John Malkovich, but once she and George Clooney actually shack up, they become who they are once again and disenchanted with each other.

Clooney enjoys sex with Francis McDormand's character until he learns she is part of his paranoid misadventure. She is willing to sell trade secrets to the Russian Embassy to make enough money for plastic surgery. Her employer at the health club is obviously in love with her and is willing to overlook her suddenly bad work habits. Brad Pitt perfectly plays an airhead personal trainer, yet is fearless in espionage matters. John Malkovich is fired from Intelligence and writes his memoirs in a drunken stupor to get back at the agency. In fact, it is Malkovich's papers that get into the hands of Francis! It is a big loop-di-loop. Even though I gave important parts of the story above, none is a spoiler!

Even Clooney's wife, a children's book author for pete's sake, is having an affair. Do we really know another human being, even those we love and live with? The Coens say no. All these people are solid citizens, yet behave abominably when their little universes fall apart.

""Burn After Reading"" falls short of documentary realism only in being better edited than most of what happens in DC. It is the peculiar genius of the Coen Brothers to be able to sum up the essential weirdness of wildly diverse 'cultures.' They nailed LA in 'The Big Lebowsky.' They encapsulated the mythic South in 'Oh Brother.' They are to cultural anthropology what music is to traffic noise, or Baudelaire is to the Paris phone book. They have distilled, in Burn After Reading, the intrinsic nasty stupidity of the 'Intelligence' community, the same people who have given us the best film noir moments of the Post-Cold War.

The only good thing about the mutant dog do virus strain that laid me out a few days ago (spread by the wheels of that wheelchair in which The Smirker made his escape) is that I've had a chance to catch up on a few films. Oh, I meant to see Burn After Reading eventually, despite the lukewarm response it's gotten from crrrrritics, but I might have forgotten. Thank you, flu! This film is a Coen Brothers masterpiece, far more interesting and well-crafted than 'No Country for Old Men', which the Brothers made only for money and to scam the idiots who award Oscars.

The casting of Burn After Reading has to be recognized as a manifestation of generous confidence on the part of the Coens in each of the over-exposed actors involved.  Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Brad Pitt? Who else would have believed they were capable of real character acting! Malkovich, yes, but he must have had enormous fun. I'm tempted to think the actors paid the producers of this film for the privilege of proving their craft. Frances McDormand of course is in reality the third Coen Brother... you know, like Groucho, Chico, and Harpo?

Here's my advice:  Don't wait for the Bushy Tail Flu to lay you on your couch! Catch 'Burn After Reading' any way you can!",1232755200,2,2012,4.672316384180791

I didn't like the movie 'Reservoir Dogs' for the same reason. The point is people are stupid and there is no avoiding in the film. pointless.

The highlight of the film is the 'goofy' acting and personality of the characters in the film. Brad Pitts character is goofy but stupid and silly which is a slight different acting for him but again, another stupid character.

3594728,5,B001G0N22G,"After going ""serious"" with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, The Coen Brothers return to the genre of quirky black comedy with this hilarious movie populated with some very stupid people.  Interestingly, the actors playing these dodos are usually cast as pretty smart characters.

The plot has to do with a disgruntled ex-CIA analyst (John Malkovich), who decides to write his ""tell all"" memoirs.  His wife (Tilda Swinton), who is having an affair with U.S. Marshal George Clooney, is planning to divorce John and, upon advice of her attorney, she copies various files from her husband's hard drive...including his book notes.

In a roundabout way, the computer disc falls into the hands of two moronic gym employees (Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt), who blackmail Malcovich for its return.  When he doesn't pay, they decide to sell it elsewhere.

Events quickly spiral out-of-control as all of the characters' lives converge toward an outrageous climax that is classic Coen Brothers.

The entire cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins and J.K. Simmons, is terrific in their atypical roles, but top honors go to Pitt, who may be playing the dumbest criminal ever portrayed on film.

DVD extras include a trio of ""Making of"" featurettes.

The storyline uses one of those intersecting lives plots where a bunch of seemingly unrelated people are connected through coincidence.  Malkovich plays a low-level spy who has hit a rough patch at work.  His wife is secretly working on a divorce so she can spend more time with George Clooney, who is more or less a sex fiend.  Things really get complicated when two blundering fitness center trainers (Brad Pitt and the Fargo woman) get pulled into the fray and attempt to blackmail Malkovich. On paper, the plot looks interesting. The screenplay though is a disaster.

I think this movie was attempting to pull off a dark comedy.  In the end though the characters seemed depraved but not in a funny way.  Brad Pitt's character (fitness trainer) was the most likable character in the bunch. He's a real doof and you can't help but laugh. Yet the script finds a way to suck the joy out that one too.

*Excellent video/sound quality.
*Includes a few featurettes and BD-live capability.
*Excellent photography.
*Production design is good.  Many of the sets are distinctive.  The costumes are fitting for the characters.
*Interesting story, built around a series of ironic incidents that are ultimately quite funny.
*Characters are great; each one is distinctive and has his/her own unique range of issues and quirks.  The acting is excellent; each actor has a wide range of great expressions and emotions.  The writing is great; there are lots of funny memorable lines throughout.
*The characters also intoduce a fascinating theme about people trying to improve themselves.  It's like a cornerstone of the whole movie.

The Bad Things
*Abrupt ending; it feels like all of the film's problems were solved in a big rush that seems contrived and unsatisfactory (although now that I think about it, it could correspond to the way the CIA dudes wrap up the story's problems so quickly and conveniently; it's as if the directors did the same thing to the movie itself, thus serving as some kind of meta-joke.  Or maybe they just got lazy.  Who knows?).
*Contains lots of swearing, some brief violence, and some sex.  Not reccomended to anybody who's easily offended.

I found this film to be very well-made, with some great characters and lots of funny moments.  I think the best thing about it is the overall story, which is built heavily on irony.  It's high-brow humor that's genuinely funny.  It's probably not for everybody, but fans of the Coen brothers and fans of these kinds of comedies should enjoy it.",1232496000,,1619,5.041353383458647

However, that people like Clooney would even consider sleeping with old, physically worn and utterly obnoxious quarry is patently ridiculous. That John Malkovich [Osbourne Cox] didn't require vocal chord surgery after his endless rants is alone interesting, I suppose. That [Katie] Tilda Swinton isn't playing the role of spinster, rather than anyone remotely interesting to any man on this planet - particularly George Clooney - rocks the mind. That Brad Pitt [Chad] would stoop so low. And last but not least, IS Linda [Frances McDormand] who is the most irritating and illogically sketched characters in modern cinema, and the only sociopath who makes it out of this thing in one piece. In short, this movie obliterates the concept of suspension of disbelief because people can't suspend it that long.

3594741,5,B001G0N22G,"First of all, my wife and I are big Coen brothers fans.

I watched this movie and found some of the scenes outrageously funny, but I was more ambivalent than my wife. I felt it was ""reminiscent in feel"" of the Big Lebowski. Then we watched the commentary, and one of the principals made the remark that it was a ""comedy about old people"", and it was a Eureka moment for me. Most of these characters are in some ways privileged, but they just don't enjoy it, or have sense enough to realize the problem is within themselves, yet they are obsessed at finding that ""magical"" answer. It doesn't hurt that the Coen display a feel for the Beltway life of Washington that they did for the deep South in O Brother, or for L. A. in Liebowski. How do guys from New York understand places that are so ""distant from New York""?

These are a bunch of middle-aged plus people (except for Brad Pitt, who's character is none too bright), who all think they are smarter than they really are, and who all believe that somehow life (or some person or combination of persons) is conspiring to deprive them of some deeper part of the pie that will guarantee their fulfillment.

If you are a Boomer, who has ever had a job where you didn't feel there was anywhere for you to progress, or who has ever been in a dead-ending relationship, I think you will see the brilliant humor in this movie. For you younger people, it will probably happen to you too in time.

This movie to me is very perceptive about how easy it is to get things all wrong about what your problems are -- especially as you are playing the ""back 9"" of your career and your life. In fact, there's quite an object lesson here with which the Bard of Avon and his Polonius would be quite at home -- if you are honest with yourself, you are not likely to be dishonest with anyone else or be taken advantage of. If you can't be honest with yourself, you are quite at risk to do bizarre and mistaken things.

Legitimately, several of the scenes and elements of the plot do echo ""The Big Lebowski"", so I recommend you give yourself a chance to watch this movie a couple of times -- it grew on me, as did Lebowski or O Brother.

All of the cast do outstanding jobs in their characters. Brad Pitt is great as a dimwitted muscle man, George Clooney plays an amusing philander with a paranoid streak, and John Malcovich is excellent, between the F-bombs, as the Spook that is constantly being crapped on.

Tilda Swinton has fascinated me for years as I always go back to that image of her playing the queen with that super pale skin and red hair and then see her in a more contemporary setting. In this one, she comes off as a modern, sexy woman, caught in a doomed relationship, and not a medieval royal figure.

Then there is Frances McDormand. She is great in everything she does, and she plays such down-to-earth characters. She is no raving beauty, at least not in the anorexic Barbie doll way, but beautiful in a real way which makes her one of my favorite comic actresses.

The rest of the cast is good too, especially the head CIA man, J.K. Simmons, with his goofy blas attitude.

There is no wasted dialogue, no dead air, and the pace is pretty quick most of the time.  Yes, there is profanity and some violence, but not nearly as much as what occurs in many movies.
The best parts:  Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt--they are hilarious; the kindly man played by Richard Jenkins; the weird chair that George Clooney builds in his basement; much of the dialogue; the shots.
Weaker parts:  there seems to be no point in showing Cox's father; Malkovich isn't looking too good these days; the soundtrack is a bit distracting.
If there is something to be learned from what happens in the story, it's this:  people who do stupid, vain, greedy things suffer serious consequences.

3594768,5,B001G0N22G,Burn After Reading is a good dark comedy from the Coen brothers.  This movie has an all star cast. This movie is a commentary about what happens to people when they reach middle age.  Frances McDormand steals the movie as a woman looking for love.  She has a strong desire for cosmetic surgery that a lot of middle age women do.  Brad Pitt is also funny as an employee of a health club. John Malkovich's character is going through a crisis after losing his job. He has some funny moments in the movie with just his physical presence.

The rationale is that artists, like brand names, should not be counted on to be consistent in their ability to please us, the viewers.  If we did, and they consistently delivered, that would mean they have ceased taking chances and risks.  In other words, they cease being artists.

And that would leave us being mindless consumers who are predisposed to anything with their name on it.  In many parts of the world, these mindless consumers are also known as Label Wh*res.

I love No Country For Old Men, but to compare one work of art with another would also be unfair to the leagues of apple and orange.

What we have here is poor John Malkovich (playing Osbourne Cox) being victimized once again, by a throng of mediocre hoi polloi.  Instead of John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, it is now Cohen veteran Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt.  Coming across one of his possessions, they plot a nitwit ransom scheme to extort money out of this recently fired, ex-CIA employee.  Cox's friend, played by George Clooney overacts his comic seriousness across from his extramarital partner, Tilda Swinton's odious British expat wife of Cox's.  All this weaves in and out of government officials who have less clue than a pair of absolute beginners, the gym staff Pitt and McDormand.

The most entertaining inference is the notion that the powers that be are so fragile in its checks-and-balances that a country and its government could be brought down by the incompetence of the people it is suppose to serve and protect.

The combination of the characters beleaguering Malkovich's character, and the forces their lack of articulation invariably sets in motion, makes a viewer squirm in her seat, making her want to tear her hair out, and scream for just one capable person to take ownership of the plot.

Osbourne Cox is the personification of such an outrage.

And what happens to Cox in the end, is what Burn After Reading does to our outrage.

I felt a trace of playwright Joe Orton's absurd comedy of errors, but honestly, given  the amount of talent, this could have been a more engaging film.  Instead, it feels more like Hollywood powerplayers getting together to give each other backrubs on some bartered budget.

REVIEW
The Coen Brothers' hit-or-miss filmography, which with gems such as ""Fargo"" (1996) and ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), has more recently erred on the side of hit, makes an incredible miss with ""Burn After Reading"". The film's nothing more than a mish-mash of unremarkable sequences.

By about midway through the film, you know it's not going to amount to anything much. One of the characters reveals a strange home invention that is either meant to shock the audience into laughter, or reveal something odd about the character, because as yet he has no depth. It's like when it starts raining toads in ""Magnolia"" (1999). When the home invention scene fails, the Coens try for shock value with a repulsive scene in which John Malkovitch hacks to death poor Richard Jenkins.

What is particularly annoying is that the performances of Malkovitch, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt and J K Simmons are simply amalgamations of characters they each played in earlier films.  Further, if you have seen the film, imagine if Tilda Swinton's character were removed completely - would this be consequential?

""Burn After Reading"" has been touted as a quirky comedy/thriller. It's a tiny bit quirky. It's funny once or twice. It's hardly thrilling.",1231027200,10,1296,5.09433962264151
3594781,2,B001G0N22G,"The Coen brothers make an interesting team.  They have a catalogue of superior movies, along with a few lesser ones.  They seem to be unable to top the unique comic absurdity of Lebowski, although O Brother was a close second.  Hudsucker was a pretty good absurd comedy and Barton Fink was a workable blend of comedy and drama.

Similarly, their more serious features like Fargo and No Country for Old Men (based on a book they didn't write) were very well cast and well made.

Burn After Reading was short, bland, and relied too much on star power instead of any interesting sort of satire or a steady stream of comic lines.  They even resort to an adult form of prop comedy which is not as titillating or amusing as they thought it would be.

This film, according to my experience with it and according to the Coens' comments in the bonus features, seems more like a film school project without much of a point.  They weren't all that passionate about satirizing spy movies like Borne Identity or Breach or the scores of others.  To me, this film is a gathering of some talented actors performing well beneath their standards.

It is funny in some parts, but the spoof factor is not very insightful and is far from hilarious.  I expect more from the Coen Brothers.  This is more on the level of Intolerable Cruelty or Ladykillers, neither of which represents their A-game.

Might be worth a rental if you adore everything the Coens do, but I wouldn't buy it.",1230940800,2,1460,4.569230769230769

I have thoroughly enjoyed previous Coen Bros. films like ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men,"" so I held high expectations for ""Burn After Reading"".  Alas, this is a throw-away, unrepresentative of the Coen opus.  The story is disjointed, and the characters unlikeable.  Attempts at the Coens' trademark dark humor abound, but most fall flat.  Irony is everwhere in this movie, with perhaps the most ironical being it's a so-so movie made by a great team.

BTW, I thought Brad Pitt's performance of a not-too bright jock stereotypical but *awesomely* done.  He was truly funny and multi-dimensional in this supporting role, and I'm not a huge fan of his normally.  The other actors appeared oddly one-dimensional, especially considering their capabilites: Malkovitch raging, Swinton cooling, Clooney drooling, and McDormand simply kinda sad.

3594786,5,B001G0N22G,"I love the Coen Brothers, but wasn't really a fan of ""No Country for Old Men."" As I would expect from filmmakers of their caliber, it was well-shot, well-paced and well-performed by the actors. I just found it to be overly bleak, lacking much of the humor I usually look for in their movies, and largely undeserving of the massive praise and perceived intellectual depth heaped on it by critics, audiences, and the Academy.

""Burn After Reading"" is a refreshing indication that the Coens have neither allowed the massive success of ""No Country"" to get to their heads, nor lost their twisted, tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. An absolutely superb cast, a tight script, and their usual technical brilliance have combined to form what suspiciously resembles a massive, big-budget middle finger to, well, everyone. Less than a year after America searched for, and claimed to find, ""deep meaning"" in the pessimistic gorefest of ""No Country,"" they made a hilarious, entertaining movie that means absolutely nothing, and actually flat-out states that it means absolutely nothing.

People who claim that the movie isn't funny clearly don't understand that the movie itself is the joke. (The movie itself is pretty funny too though, I guess just maybe not for everyone). It was interesting to see early reviews come in, to watch the same bandwagon-jumping critics who lavished praise on ""No Country"" grasping for some kind of intellectual or moral purpose in all this, only to be confounded by the final scene which states, in plain, unmistakeable terms, that there is no such thing to be found here.",1230854400,2,1590,5.0418250950570345

That spark of interest that nearly all Coen brothers movies have never quite fires in this movie for me, and things don't coalesce until well into it.

3594796,4,B001G0N22G,"The Coen Brothers are in familiar territory with ""Burn After Reading"", a black comedy revolving around a hare-brained extortion scheme. Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) has quit his analyst job at the CIA rather than be demoted on account of his drinking problem. His frosty bourgeois wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), a pediatrician who couldn't be less suited to the job, considers the loss of income good reason for divorce. Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is a bubble-headed gym employee in desperate want of four expensive cosmetic surgeries. When a CD containing Osbourne's memoir-in progress is found in the gym's locker room, Linda's buff, vapid co-worker Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) deduces that it is top secret stuff. Linda sees an opportunity to get her surgeries and impress her new lover Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), who makes a hobby of meeting women through an internet dating service, in spite of having a wife and a mistress, Katie.

This overcomplicated plot is in contrast to Joel and Ethan Coen's last film, ""No Country for Old Men"", whose structure was a simple chase. Everyone is connected to everyone else and to that blasted CD without knowing it. The deadpan incredulity of two CIA bureaucrats who are trying to sort it all out produces some of the film's best lines. There has been criticism that Linda and Chad are too stupid to be interesting or sympathetic, but all characters involved in the cockamamie schemes that are the basis of most thrillers are, in fact, stupid, and the brothers Coen are making fun of that here. Brad Pitt's cheerful dim-bulb Chad is one of his most memorable performances. And though we're immersed in dumbness, minor characters and well-placed set decoration fill the film out with more subtle comedy. As to whether ""Burn After Reading"" makes a political statement, well, the CIA sweeps the carnage under the carpet without trying very hard to understand what's going on. Under those circumstances, we might all do the same. But I wonder if the Coens did not mean something by it.

""DC Insiders Run Amok"" (12 min) interviews the Coens about how they conceived the story and writing roles for particular actors. The cast talk about their characters. Costume designer Mary Zophres chimes in with the ideas behind the costumes. And production designer Jess Gonchor discusses shooting in New York for Georgetown. ""Welcome Back George"" (3 min) in an interview with Clooney in which he talks about the parts the Coens have written for him.

And (3) the 'lighter' comedies (Intolerable Cruelty, Ladykillers).
Burn After Reading belongs imo to category 3. The actors are excellent, the plot turns in ways hard to foresee and the clumsiness of everyone are really entertaining.

3594802,5,B001G0N22G,"""Burn After Reading""  is the recent Cohn Brothers drama about a pair of not-too-bright gym employees (Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand) who discover what they think is classified CIA information on a disc left in a locker and try to demand a ransom for its return.  Because they're not very good at blackmail, however, their plan soon spins way out of control.  Costarring George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, and Richard Jenkins, ""Burn After Reading"" is one of the quirkiest movies from the Cohns, who put ""quirky"" on the cinematic map.  The revelation here is Brad Pitt, who plays his character, Chad Feldheimer, as an enthusiastic dimwit who never realizes he's way out of his depth.  Watching him plot with coworker Linda Litzke (McDormand), who joins in the blackmail scheme because she needs a lot of cash for a series of cosmetic surgeries, is a joy.  The movie is very funny, but does take a couple of unexpected detours to the dark side, so be warned.  The DVD contains a making-of featurette and a comic piece featuring George Clooney as he returns for his third collaboration with Joel and Ethan Cohn.",1230422400,2,1118,4.852631578947369

""Blood Simple"", ""Raising Arizona"", ""Miller's Crossing"", ""Barton Fink"", and of course ""No Country for Old Men"" are all great movies.  This film was just sloppy.  All the characters seemed purposefully one dimensional, and most were just boring.  I may have laughed once, but I doubt it. It just seemed like a random string of events that just abruptly and stupidly ended.  The ending randomly switched from an action scene to that of one guy narrating the remaining part of the scene to his boss.  That just left such a bad taste in my mouth.  It's like they had to stop shooting at that outside location and said "" F*** it, we are the Coen brothers and these idiots will watch anything that we slap together.  Who's got a garage that we can wrap this up in?""  I love the Coen brothers.  They are right on up there with Wes Anderson in terms of creating a new genre, then exploring it.

Where else, other than as a Amazon film reviewer, can one feel so smugly superior and amused at the strivings and shortcomings of others, while celebrating the satisfaction of the bully, with the balm of comedy and farce, than in a Coen Brothers film? Not all of us can be paid to feel that way, some of us have to pay others, like the Coens, to provide us with two hours or so of escape to these wonderful sentiments.

Unfortunately, the directing is so heavy-handed that any humour there may have been is squeezed out of each scene by stretching it to the breaking point - for example, Brad Pitt doing a goofy happy dance is amusing for five seconds, perhaps even ten, but excruciating after two minutes. Consequently, the pacing is tedious and the overall effect sluggish and disjointed.

The always reliable Frances McDormand looks as if nothing could be more fun, and Clooney and Malkovich are so very intense, creating outrageously lovable idiots. Tilda Swinton is the only grounded character, with that glint of satiric bitchiness that is most enjoyable. Richard Jenkins is also grounded, though baffled by the insanity. I can't blab away the plot, as others did, but suffice it to say that this is a story about bad decisions taken way beyond comprehension. It's no end of fun, and if you pay attention, you'll be breathless when it's over. Terrific film, and another feather in the enigmatic hat of the Coen brothers. They cannot be labelled, out-guessed or pinned down in any genre; they succeed in all: ""Miller's Crossing"", ""O Brother..."", ""No Country..."",  and, especially, their first, ""Blood Simple"". (I still don't know what the hell was going on in ""Barton Fink""). The Coens are eclectic in their choices, and isn't that refreshing!? Unfortunately, there weren't enough DVD extras for me.

I feel like it's important to state how much I liked Raising Arizona to give you a sense of why I found Burn After Reading so great. If you didn't find Raising Arizona funny or if you found it downright awful then there's no chance you'll enjoy Burn After Reading.

The comedy is subtle. The jokes aren't easily identifiable. The characters are quirky and strange. And it's such a fun movie for all of those reasons. And there are some unexpected scenes that had me doubled over with laughter.

3594808,5,B001G0N22G,"It is a comedy and it is funny. But why is it so funny? It is funny first because it is a parody of American society, of the small middle class of working people who are not particularly swift and definitely not lucky but they just do what they do with some desire to get some satisfaction out of it. Maybe even some profit or benefit. The favors of a woman, or some extra investment money. Nothing really serious but just five plastic surgery operations for the bargain price of $25,000. And that would give some dynamic ambition to anyone, and anything would be good enough to make that extra money. When you add to that the fact that everyone is playing around with another woman or another man, and the film remains within the limits of straight-dom, you have it all. The spy-apprentices will get entangled with the adulterous spouses and the situation is unbelievably complex, and lethal if not plain deadly. But then the film - and it starts with that - is situated all around one third rank CIA executive, hence with spies and other undercover actions and activities. But since most people in that situation are not in any way listed as active spies, the CIA top boss - if there is one - just wonders what it is all about and his reaction will be to clean up the situation. And the clean-up will be drastic. Only the three women will survive: the spouse of the spy, the spouse of the security service chap and the unmarried woman who wants to finance her plastic surgery. The two spouses are free since the two men they were married to end up dead. And the third woman is happy too since the CIA pays for the plastic surgery to bury the  business. In other words the film is a big parody of many other films, and first of all Mission Impossible, but transferred to the level of the dummies who read all the books especially written for them, and these dummies in this film are definitely dim. And then the rest is quid pro quo (both imbroglio and legal meaning) and crazy situational complications. It turns the very serious security problems of the 21st century into a farce, and we think somewhere that after all they are a farce which makes the film absolutely righteous.

Maybe it'll grow on me, but at first sight, it's not all that interesting.  Ultimately, it's a bunch of stupid, flawed, people doing stupid things, and getting their just deserts.  None of the characters are particularly likable.  The only halfway decent character in the movie is Osborne Cox, and he's getting ready to publish a tell-all about his time in Government.  The others are morons, sex-addicts, or moronic sex-addicts.  That's a pretty thin palette.

The movie had a weird Lebowski feel to it.  When the divorce lawyer is talking to Katie Cox, I get the feeling he's about to launch into The Stranger's monologue, about Osborne Cox being the man for his time, the man who fits right in, etc.  Then, when Osborne Cox punches Feldheimer in the face and shouts ""Where's the data?"", I get an echo of ""Where's the money, Lebowski?""  Weird echoes.

The acting is well done, for what it is, and in a weird twist of fate, Brad Pitt actually fails to make it to the end of the movie.  How awesome is that?!?!!!  Clooney plays the fool, again - do the Coens have it in for him?

The sound's good, the picture's good, the acting's ok, and the DVD comes with a number of interviews that fill in some background for the movie.  It's a decent enough flick, and if you're a Coen fan - or want a gratuitous view of Tilda Swintons's butt (quite nice) - you have to have it.

I don't want to hear any word that much,even if it isn't a cuss word. I expect a little more creativity out of any movie writer. Anyway,no laugh out-loud moments. I didn't really care about the characters or how the movie ended. I hung in there hoping it would get better but it never did.

3594816,4,B001G0N22G,"After the astounding ""No Country for Old Men,"" ""Burn After Reading"" is easy to dismiss as light-hearted.

Tossed into the middle are two health club employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) looking to make a few bucks on the side.

Malkovich is a scene-stealer as always; if you want to see something absolutely terrifying, picture a drunk, raging Malkovich wielding a hatchet.  McDormand is terrific as always; Swinton plays up her ""Michael Clayton"" role, taking it up a notch a few levels.  Clooney gets by on charm alone for the first half, which is really all that's required; afterwards, he holds his own with the rest of the gang.  And Pitt...well, it's nice to see such a reknowned actor breaking image and playing a complete schmutz.  He's not exactly in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" form, but he's perfect for the role.  Supporting credit goes to the wonderful Richard Jenkins and the hilarous J. K. Simmons.

As stated before: It's easy to pass this film off as light-hearted, when compared to the Coen Brothers' previous picture.  But that would be to ignore the Brothers' entire catalogue. The final scene in ""Burn After Reading,"" though absolutely hilarious, is easily as dark and thought-provoking as anything ""No Country For Old Men"" had to offer.  This may be an inferior film on the whole, but it's still a damn-fine ensemble comedy, a dark and thoughtful piece that rockets along thanks to stellar writing, superb direction, and top-notch acting.

In short, my wife lasted about 45 minutes into the movie before she left the room.  I finished...as I kept thinking it might get better...it didn't.

It does have a dark 'Fargo-esque' quality to it (and I enjoyed the movie Fargo), but it is in no way funny.  Here's a short run-down on the movie...about 10 or so actors in a convoluted story line that tries to interconnect their actions that are mostly misguided or mistaken I guess.  The problem is 1) the script is awful and 2) the actors 'dumb-down' their characters to such a point that they are unenjoyable to watch.

In Burn After Reading, they tie together such diverse subjects as liposuction,spies and gym instructors. Frances McDormand, who is a favorite of the Coens, once again shines in this movie. She is a favorite of mine and I have to watch closely to see the art behind her work. She is simply believable to me in nearly every role.

George Clooney and Brad Pitt both get to be awkward and clownish. Pitt plays a gym instructor who discovers a disc created by Osborne Cox (played by John Malkovich) Cox is not having a good year, having been demoted as a spy and also about to have his marriage implode.

When Pitt and McDormand (both gym instructors) discover the tape, it sets into motion a whole sequences of plot twists and turns that kept me hooked. I foresaw some of them but was surprised by many other scenes....and some moments were simply laugh out loud funny. Others were horrifying. Mostly, it was a very weird movie, in the best sense of the word ""weird"".

I also felt that there was something poignant about this film. In the ending scene, when there is musing about what happened and the lessons learned, I felt the Coens were coming as close to delivering an overall message - or warning - as they ever do, perhaps hinting at the dangers about being too complacent about security and safety and depending on the government to provide that. The movie left me wanting more, so I went back and looked at key scenes again.

Also recommended? The shooting script for this movie.",1229904000,6,1701,4.597359735973598

I did.",1229817600,3,351,4.67741935483871
3594821,2,B001G0N22G,"First off, reviewing a popular movie negatively is never a popular choice. Disagree with me all you like; reviews are opinion based, and this is my opinion. That's all it is. If you loved the movie, don't take my review personally.

The Coen brothers usually make a fantastic movie. ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", and ""No Country for Old Men"" are all five star films in my book. Even their lesser known movies are great, with the exception of the boring ""Lady Killers"". Coming on the heels of ""No County for Old Men"", my expectation level for ""Burn After Reading"" was high. Not unfairly high; I didn't expect another award winner, jut an entertaining movie with a quality story and descent acting. What I got was a fairly pointless melodramatic movie with characters it was hard to empathize with, like, or want to see succeed.

No, this is not an awful movie that is impossible to watch (well maybe during Clooney's ridiculously camera-aware mugging near the end of the film) but it isn't up to the Coen's usual standards either. All the elements of a good movie are there: quality name actors, a plot that is a highly sarcastic take on a pumped-up spy thriller, and the Coen's typical evocative camera work. What's missing is that cohesiveness that makes a movie not just a collection of good ingredients, but a finished product.

This is a movie about stupid people doing stupid things. There is no real plot; the characters careen about in their self-absorbed turbidity, digging themselves deeper and deeper into trouble. Each character seems totally incapable of self examination. The characters do not grow or change at all during the entire film. Black comedy is something the Coens are usually adept at. Unfortunately, in this film they seem more concerned with shock value and impressing the viewer with their sly wit. It feels like they are snickering with glee over their own intelligence at having imagined such sad, stupid, and shallow characters.

Every character in the film is remarkably unlikable with the possible exception of John Malkovich's recently fired, drunken, former CIA employee crotchetiness. Clooney, who I usually think does a fantastic job, (see ""Syriana"" or ""Michael Clayton"") is almost unbearable he's so self absorbed and aware of the camera. He even appears to be mugging at times. Pitt's character is funny, but doesn't stick around long enough to be more than a footnote. The acting isn't bad overall, it just that the characters are so miserable that it's hard to appreciate it.

This is a movie you can definitely watch just once. I know I'll likely get lit up for giving a relatively popular movie a negative review, but honestly, if Fargo is a 5, and No Country for Old Men is a 5, how can you put this movie in the same league as those films? Even 4 stars seems excessive for a movie as light as this one. I can't argue with 3 stars if you really liked the movie, but the reality is that I didn't like it at all and never will.

3594822,3,B001G0N22G,"The theme of this film is that people are stupid, from the leaders of the so-called ""intelligence community"" to the people who toil in the health spa business.  Unfortunately the plot is a little fuzzy in getting this across at times.

For about the first third of the movie, the viewer cannot get a handle on what he is seeing.  We see an ""intelligence agent"" get fired, go home, try to tell his distracted wife.  Soon we see a health spa clerk talking to a plastic surgeon about several surgical procedures she wants to have.  Various other characters appear, seeming to have little or no connection to what is happening.

Then finally, if the viewer is extremely patient, connections are made.
Everything turns around the health spa clerk trying to get the money to reinvent herself, as she says, and a misplaced CD that contains the start of the spy's memoirs and financial records that his wife has downloaded for her divorce attorney.

Confused?  So is the story up to a point.  There are no competent human beings portrayed in this little opus, and in that respect it is like the Coen brothers' masterpkiece, ""Fargo.""  In the end it is like that scene from a Marx Brothers film, in which a dozen people tumble out of a tiny shipboard cabin.  Only one character, perhaps the dumbest one, is anywhere near successful.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. CIA analyst Cox (John Malkovich) has a falling out with the agency, and decides to write a tell-all memoir.
2. His wife (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce, and to make sure she's forearmed with his finances, she burns a copy of some of his computer files
3. Said files fall into the incapable hands of clueless gym employees Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand), who decide to try extortion as a fund raising exercise.
4. No prizes for guessing that it doesn't quite work as planned
5. Meanwhile, Mrs. Cox is having an affair, Linda is looking for both love and cosmetic surgery, and Treasury agent Harry (George Clooney) is sleeping around.
6. Black comedy of errors follows with some rather unpredictable twists.

Fans of black comedy will thoroughly enjoy this movie, which is well directed, brilliantly acted and immensely entertaining.  Kudos go to Malkovich, Pitt, Swinton and Clooney, but the top award definitely goes to McDormand, who will have you sharing her pain.

Four and a half stars go to the Coen Brothers for this bleak look at life, adultery, blackmail and people behaving badly.

If the filmmakers wanted to make their movie a really black comedy, the gym instructors would have sold the disc to Arab terrorists instead of Russian embassy. The CIA boss at the end of the movie asks what they did wrong, my response would be the CIA should stop doing wrong things that can revealed in their ex-employees' memoirs.",1228608000,,879,4.714285714285714

The Coens just keep on surprising us, and this holds what was to me perhaps the biggest surprise of all.
