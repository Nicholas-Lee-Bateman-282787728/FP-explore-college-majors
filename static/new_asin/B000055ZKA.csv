1396429,4,B000055ZKA,"Backlash was quite an event. My best friend was their I watched it on PPV though. The Dudleyz vs X Factor was OK after the match someone got wood it was cool. The Hardcore Title match was really good Rhyno gored a shopping cart and they used a kitchen sink. The Dutchess of Queensbury match was funny. The Dutchess was Regal's tag parnter his one in WCW.The Ultimate Submisson match was awesome it went into over time. The Last Man Standing Match had an awesome elbow from the top of the Backlash Hook. The Three Way European Match got Jeff and Edge involved it was cool. The Billon Dollar Princess got a big boot and Kane got destroyed. It was a PPV worth buying. If your in doubt buy it for the Last Man Standing,Ultimate Submisson, and FIRST EVER Dutchess of Queensbury Match. It was good",988675200,,791,4.424657534246576

1396434,5,B000055ZKA,"6-Man Tag Team Match

The Dudley Boyz vs. X Factor

A not too long or too short of a match. Lots of moves that were directed down south of the human anatomy if you know what I mean. X Factor win the battle although they did not win the war at Backlash. Good Opener. 6.5/10

Hardcore Championship Match

Rhyno (c) vs. Raven

Hell Yes a brutal and fantastic hardcore match with a great diversity of weapons used within the match such as shopping trolleys, kitchen sink, stop signs etc. My favourite moment was when Rhyno gored the shopping cart after raven moved. I miss these hardcore matches. 10/10

Duchess of Queensburry Match

Chris Jericho vs. William Regal

An above-average match between Regal and Jericho in my opinion much better than their match at Wrestlemania 17 and much longer. The downside to this match is that stupid duchess kept changing the rules of the match into the favour of Regal. First no win by submission and also no Dq although Jericho did get his revenge on duchess through the walls of Jericho. 7/10 due to the rules changing every 2 mins.

30-Minute Ultimate Submission Match

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit

This match should've of happened at Wrestlemania 17. The Angle and Beniot feud of 2001 is one of my most favourite feuds of all time. A whole arsenal of different submission moves were used by both competitors and of course their own specials. The last 10 minutes were really intense due to that Beniot was behind 3 to 2 and then came back to make a draw 3/3. The match was extended a further 5 minutes under sudden death which in the end crowned Beniot the winner and in my opinion deserved it after being screwed by Angle at WM17. 10/10

Last Man Standing Match

Shane McMahon vs. The Big Show

This was definitely the highlight of the night. Some weapons were used by Shane O Mac such as a kendo stick, steel chair, keep out sign and either a cloth soaked with chloroform or something. Suddenly Test and Vince McMahon interfered in the match lifting the suspense. The ending actually made me jump as Shane did an elbow drop of the 50ft scaffold onto the Big Show. Test helped Shane up while the big show was counted out for 10 Shane wins, a Fantastic Match. 10/10

European Championship

Triple Threat Match

Eddie Guerrero vs. Christian vs. Matt Hardy (c)

The Crowd weren't really into this match after the last man standing match but overall it was pretty enjoyable. The match did indeed force you to wonder who was going to walk away Euro champ although until Edge and Jeff hardy interfered it was pretty clear that Matt was going to retain. A nice short solid title match. 7.5/10

WWE Title/Intercontinental Title/Tag Team Titles match

Stone Cold Steve Austin [WWE Champion] and Triple H [Intercontinental Champion] vs. Kane and the Undertaker [Tag Team champions]

Winners take all

I was very much surprised of how great this main event with the winner take all situation I believe was fair for Taker & Kane. This was a brutal long 20 minute brawl between the brothers of destruction against Stone Cold & Triple H. Steph got big booted in the face for her interference. Kane was double teamed throughout the majority of the match his left arm being a pin point bullseye for HHH and the rattlesnake. Taker chases after Austin through the crowd leaving Kane & Triple H until Vince interfered giving hunter a sledgehammer to which was used on Kane in the face. Stone cold and HHH become the new tag champs. 9/10

60/70 which is 85% meaning that if you are a true wrestling fan you need to buy this DVD immediately none of the matches will let you down.",1121385600,7,3596,4.593114241001565
1396435,4,B000055ZKA,"The 2001 Backlash still stands as the best Backlash so far. With a last man standing match, a hardcore match, a 30 minute ultimate submission match, and four of the baddest men in the WWE fighting in the main event, this is definately worth it.

Dudley Boyz vs. X-Factor:

This was okay for an opener. The crowd was chanting for tables the whole match. I never saw X-Factor live, but they sure made a unique tag team. X-Factor wins after the ""X Marks the Spot"" double drop kick. After the match X-Pac gets sent through a table, courteosy of the Dudley Boyz. 7/10

Hardcore Championship Match

Rhyno [Champion] vs. Raven:

Brutal hardcore match. Raven gets hammered by a shopping cart, then both men knock each other around with steel chairs and trash cans. Painful moment was when Rhyno gored the shopping cart after Raven moved. Rhyno prevails and hits the gore on Raven to win. 8.5/10

Duchess of Queensburry Match

Chris Jericho vs. William Regal:

Okay, first of all they kept changing the damn rules everytime Jericho kept winning. First there was a time limit, then no submissions to win the match, finally no disqualifications. Jericho finally put the Walls of Jericho on the Dutchess, who was at ringside, until Regal clobbers him with a chair to win. 7.5/10 strange match because of the stipulations and the Dutchess angle.

30-Minute Ultimate Submission Match

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit:

This was one great match. These two guys had some of the best technical wrestling in 2001 and this was the highlight of their fued. The man who had the most submission victories at the end wins. Both men managed to make the other tap out to arm bars, and their own holds. At around 10 minutes left Angle had about 3 submissions and Benoit had 2. Then at the last second Benoit makes Angle tap out to Angle's own hold and the match ended.

The answer to the unclear winner was sudden death, and after a few minutes Benoit managed to make Angle tap out with the crossface. 10/10 Nice match, the best one these two had in 2001.

Last Man Standing Match

Big Show vs. Shane McMahon:

The ironic thing was that these two were allies just one year prior to this match. Some weapons were used by Shane O' Mack, including a kendo stick, a steel chair, and even an rag soaked in ether. An appearance by Mr. McMahon and Test made the match that more exciting.

The ending was unbelievable, as Shane climbs 50 feet up a scaffold and gives an elbow drop to the Big Show! Shane McMahon wins a brutal Last Man Standing Match. 9/10

European Championship

Triple Threat Match

Eddie Guerreroe vs. Christian vs. Matt Hardy [Champion]:

To tell the truth, I don't know why this match was on the card, it was the second worst match on the DVD. Edge and Jeff Hardy both make appearances and Jeff helps his brother win the match. 7/10

World Heavyweight Title/Intercontinental Title/Tag Team Titles match

Stone Cold Steve Austin [World Heavyweight Champion] and Triple H [Intercontinental Champion] vs. Kane and the Undertaker [Tag Team champions]

Winners take all:

This was a wild 20 minute plus brawl between the tag team champions and the Intercontinental champion and the World Heavyweight champion. All through the match both Stone Cold and Triple H tried to leave going through the crowd but the Brothers of Destruction chased them down. Stephanie was at ringside and gets knocked down after trying to help out her husband.

Kanes arm was a big red bullseye because in the weeks prior he was beaten up and his arm was bandaged. Then Mr. McMahon makes an appearance again with a sledgehammer and Triple H nails Kane in the head with the sledgehammer. Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin win the tag team titles. 9/10

The main event, last man standing match, ultimate submission match, and the hardcore match are four very good reasons why to get this DVD. And to think most people are saying this is one of the worst ppvs of 2001! 2004 would have killed for a ppv like this....",1114128000,5,3968,4.6571018651362985
1396446,3,B000055ZKA,"Overall it is a good PPV, but the best is the last match between taker n kane vs Austin n HHH.

1396447,5,B000055ZKA,"Dudley Boyz VS X-Factor: A good opener with X-Factor winning

Rhyno VS Raven: Something the WWE is sorely lacking these days is the hardcore division. It gave many wrestlers something to do and towards the end it was getting very serious competiton. This match was brutal and awesome.

Chris Jericho VS William Regal in a Dutchess of Queensbury Rules Match: A confusing match with the rules changing every few minutes. A decent match but the rule changing brought it down a bit.

Kurt Angle VS Chris Beniot in a 30-Minute Iron Man Match: An excellent match between two men who never wrestle a bad match. A must watch

Shane McMahon VS Big Show in a Last Man Standing Match: Shane O' Mac puts on anther good performance in a hardcore match. Very good match and the ending was awesome.

Eddie Guerrero VS Christian VS Matt Hardy: A good match with Jeff Hardy helping his brother win in the end.

Brothers of Destruction (Undertaker and Kane) VS Stone Cold and Triples H: An enjoyable main event, I hated Austin and Triple H at this time. They win the tag belts from Brothers of Destruction.

Overall, an awesome PPV. The menu is very inventive and one of the best ive seen on a WWE/WWF dvd. A must own",1108512000,,1199,4.523148148148148
1396472,4,B000055ZKA,"Backlash 2001 looked to be a great pay per view going in.  Lots of good story lines and great superstars participated.  The opening match is a 3 man tag team match featuring X-Factor(X-Pac, Justin Credible, & Albert) against The Dudley Boyz & Spike.  Solid opening match with some good table action in the end.
The Hardcore Championship was on the line in what might have been the match of the night.  Champion Rhyno, & Raven battle it out in a good hardcore match with lots of pops in the audience.  These guys showed what it meant to be in ECW.  Next is a Duchess of Queensbury match between William Regal & Chris Jericho.  This match is bull right from the beginning.  The ""duchess"" changes the rules a number of times during the match making it extremely unfair & stupid.
Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit put on yet another good match in a 30 minute ultimate Submission bout.  The two are tied when the 30 minutes are up so they go into some wicked over time.  Shane McMahon faces the Big Show next in a Last Man Standing Match.  Ok match, with one of the best stunts ever performed by Shane McMahon.  He drops a shoulder on to the Big Show from over 50 feet.  Not the match of the night, but certainly the moment of the night.  Matt Hardy, Eddie Guerrero, & Christian show why they were up and coming superstars in the WWF in this triple threat European Championship match.
The main event of the night featuring WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin, Intercontinental Champion, Triple H, & the Tag Team Champions, Kane & Undertaker, was a complete dud.  Everybody expected a great match from these 4, and they failed miserably.  Kane, who is my favorite wrestler, had a injured arm for the whole match, which just made it worse.
Pretty good DVD but if you buying it for the HUGE main event, don't bother, & get Judgemnt Day 2001 instead.",1088121600,,1834,4.478915662650603

Dudleys V X-Factor
This was a great opening match, with some nice spots including the Dudleys throwing Spike onto X-Pac. The ending is a bit crap, but afterwards X-Pac is put through a table! 7/10
Hardcore title - Rhyno V Raven
This was a absolutely brilliant hardcore match, involving many weapons, including chairs, signs, a sink and even a shopping trolley! There were some great spots, and the whole match never got boring at all. The only bad points were the sudden ending and it could have lasted longer. 9/10
Dutchess of Queensbury Rules - Chris Jericho V William Regal
This basically involved Jericho constantly being screwed. Regal keeps making up new rules, such as no submission and no DQ. It was quite entertaining though. 7/10
30 minute Ultimate Submission - Chris Benoit V Kurt Angle
This was a great technical match, with good mat wrestling. However, those who don't like that kind of match will find this boring and it drags on for ages. 6/10
Last Man Standing - Big Show V Shane McMahon
This match was great, and Shane refuses to loose. Vince even comes in and hits Shane with a chiar, but he still gets up. The ending is amazing, with Shane jumping off the top of the titantron all the way down onto the Big Show who's lying on some wood. The end gets an extra point! 9/10
European title match - Guerrero V Christian V Matt Hardy
A solid 3-way match. It's funny at the end as Jeff comes in to help Matt and Edge comes in to help Christian, but no one comes to help Guerrero. 7/10

This match prooved the fact that an audience could be entertained by real technical wrestling, and 30 minutes of it. A great 5 star match and one of 2001's 5 best matches. Also worth viewing was the Rhyno vs. Raven Hardcore match. The match was almost perfect for a hardcore match, even though that's not my type of wrestling.

The Last Man Standing match between Shane McMahon and The Bigshow was also a classic, especially the ending where Shane drops an elbow from the top of a 40ft. steel structure!

1396476,5,B000055ZKA,"WWE Backlash was great. This was the second best WWE pay-per-view event of 2001(just behind Wrestlemania 17). It's one of the best pay-per-view events ever in WWE history. With that said, I've made a list of my top 3 favorite matches of WWE Backlash 2001: Number 3: Undertaker and Kane v.s. Stone Cold and Triple H(Tag Team title and WWE title on the line)- The main event of WWE Backlash featured the two 7 foot monsters Undertaker and Kane taking on Stone Cold and Triple H (Who battled each other in No Way Out 2001 but now were teaming up). This making was full of intense action and excitement.
 Number 2: Raven v.s. Rhyno(Harecore title on the line)-This match was Hardcore and featured lots of blood bashing weapons such as chairs, trash can lids, shopping carts,and a whole lot more. Great hardcore match.
 Number 1: Big Show v.s Shane McMahon- By far the best match of WWE Backlash and the best match of 2001. What made this match my favorite was when Shane McMahon climbed up on top of the stage about 40 feet high in the air and just jumped right off of the stage and landed right on the 7'2'', 500 pound Big Show.

This movie is fantastic and is a must own for everyone.",1024531200,2,1182,4.43778801843318
1396477,5,B000055ZKA,I think that Backlash was one the bes best ppv's of 2001. Shane McMahon jumping off the set was amazing. The main event All Titles on the line was one of the best that I have seen. I also liked the Hardcore match between Raven and Rhyno. I rate this with 5 stars.

1396479,4,B000055ZKA,"Wrestlemania 17 could be the greatest wrestling pay-per-view ever.  So how do you follow that up?  By putting on a another great, exciting ppv that makes the WWF look like they haven't lost a step without competition.  I have the DVD (Why not?) and it has some nice features.
The interviews are from Regal, The Dudleys (including Spike), Benoit and Big Show.  Skip Regal's.  Not funny or anythng.  If you like the Dudleys, watch that one.  Benoit and Big Show do pretty darn well being extremely intense on hurting someone.  This sets up all the match histories, four in all.  The DVD also includes two extra ('Heat') matches.
Jerry Lynn vs. Crash Holly for the Lightweight Championship match was pretty darn exciting.  Short because it was heat but long enough to show both Crash and Lynn can go.  Too bad Lynn isn't on TV.  Where is he, anyway?  Oh well, 4 stars.
The other match between Lita vs. Molly Holly had better wrestling then some men matches I've seen.  These two ladies can really go and show it here.  A rare 5 stars because it just had it all.
Enough of this DVD extra.  You want the matches are here they are:
1) X-Facter (X-Pac, Credible, and Albert) vs. Dudleys (Spike, D-Von, and Buh Buh):  A good match with a good ending.  The Dudleys did give Chicago what they want: WOOD.  4 stars out of 5.
2) Rhyno vs. Raven: Hardcore Champ Match.  This was the best hardcore match I have ever seen (I still haven't seen Hardy vs. RVD Ladder Hardcore match).  Rhyno and Raven know hardcore and doing it that way all their lives.  5 stars.
3) Matt Hardy vs. Christian vs. Guerrero: European Champ Match.  Great triple-threat match.  Fun and exciting to watch.  It had good interference but could have been excellent without it. 4.5 stars.
4) Jericho vs. Regal: Dushess of Queensberry match.  Rules are told as the match goes along.  That was the first problem.  The second problem was that you knew Y2J was going to screwed like crazy.  Good match between the two but couldn't hold the match up.  3.5 stars.
5) Benoit vs. Angle: 30-minute submission match.  Most submissions in 30-minutes wins.  It's cool at first, slows down then goes back to being cool at the end.  Still a good match but still it left me going 'That's it?'  I think i wanted more submission moves.  4 stars.
6) Shane McMahon vs. Big Show: Last Man Standing.  Fun and exciting.  Shane is a great athlete for someone who isn't suppose to be.  Huge Shane bump.  Still, I think Shane has done better.  4.5 stars.
7) Austin/Triple H vs. Kane/Undertaker: 3 titles on the line.  If Triple H is pinned, he loses his Intercontinental belt.  Austin pinned, he loses WWF champ.  If Taker or Kane loses, tag team godl belongs to the Two-Man Power Trip.  Good match but just didn't seem up to par.  The four guys can do more and I've seen them do exciting stuff.  3.5 stars.

I think the Rock's movie career made this backlash different from the previous two. After the prior two wrestlemanias (15 and 16), we had a return bout of sorts,like Austin and Rock at Backlash'99, and the rock vs. hhh at last years backlash. This year with the rock going into showbiz, the wwf had to start over with a new storyline, instead of riding through wrestlemania,and into backlash. For myself, it may not have been the best of the three in this series, but it was as entertaining. And one more thing, am I the only one who can stand a tag team main event every once and a while? This main event put four of the top tier of the wwf in an awesome tag team for the wwf title, i.c. title, and the tag team titles. This match was in it self worth the money. Plus the hardcore title match between raven and rhyno was both extreme and hillarious at times. The only problem I had with this ppv was the Dutchess of Queensbury rules match; the match itself was good by why have distracting rules to interfere in such a good followup to their WMX7 match? I do recommend this dvd,and the extra matches were cool. Backlash was better than people admit, and if you are a serious wwf fan like me.

Match 2: Hardcore Champion Rhyno vs. Raven - awesome match here...the best Hardcore Title Match since the title started.....Raven and Rhyno rules!!!!! ECW 4-ever RATING: ****
Match 3: William Regal vs. Chris Jerichio - good match here but it could have done without the screwjobs by the nasty queen on the outside. RATING: ***1/2
Match 4: Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle in a Ironman submission match - this was a boring 30 min for me.......I don't know why they couldn't just have a regular iron match.......this was just very disapointing. RATING: **
Match 5: The Big Show vs. Shane McMahon - bad match but Shane is the new Mick Foley as a bumptaker and boy he proved it here. RATING: ***1/4
Match 6: European Champion Matt Hardy vs. Christian vs. Eddy Guerrero - all 3 of these wrestlers are talented and I really loved this match!!!!!!! I don't know why but its awesome!!!!!! good one here RATING: ***1/2
Match 7: World Champion Steve Austin & I-C Champion HHH vs. Tag Team Champions Kane & Taker - horrible match and every knew what the ending was gonna be so don't waster your time RATING: *1/3

1396506,3,B000055ZKA,"I was extremely excited when I saw this live right here in Chicago, Illinois, this being my first ever PPV live in person. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Taking place during the same month of WresleMania X-7, I knew the guys behind the scenes might try and rush things to culminate on the procedding PPV. The WWF was 3 for 3 on great PPVs when WrestleMania turned out to be an outstanding PPV and in my opinion probably the greatest WrestleMania yet. I was getting excited when they started booking the matches especially the main event with all the major titles on the line. There were only 3 matches I thought were good, but not exciting. Those included the main event, the triple threat European title match, and the Last Man Standing match involving Shane McMahon jumping off over 50 feet off the entrance structure. The Angle/Benoit match could have been better. What in the world was that Dutchess of Queensbury match thing all about? To sum it up, the event could have been a lot better, but I'm not pointing fingers at anyone. Who could blame the WWF for putting on 3 tremendous PPVs in a row before this one? As for the DVD extras, all you get are 2 matches from Sunday Night Heat that are probably less than 10 minutes each and interviews and segments that you already get before each match. I bought this just for the sake of knowing I was there but I probably wouldn't recommend buying this.",994032000,,1415,4.509727626459144
1396507,5,B000055ZKA,"Backlash wasn't that bad, the match I really liked was the 30 minute submission match between Kurt Angle against Chris Benoit. The main event was kind of a boring match. I liked the hardcore match between Rhyno and Raven. The X-Factor and Dudley match was a nice opener to the ppv. Jericho and Regal match was pretty good, I thought it was better than their match at wrestlemania. The last man standing match was amazing and I liked what Shane did when he jumped of the set to land on the Big Show. Overall the Pay-per-view was really cool.",993945600,,540,4.4646464646464645
1396508,4,B000055ZKA,"I'm not exactly sure why I even said this ppv was alright. I mean, Wrestlemania X-Seven was just too tough of an event to follow in my opinion. Don't get me wrong though, Backlash did provide some pretty cool entertainment with the Benoit/Angle Ultimate Submission Match and the Triple Title Tag Match between Austin/Triple H and Underaker/Kane. Bottom line, it's only worth buying if you are a hardcore wrestling fan, or if you missed the event and need it for the collection. Not the worst for 2001 so far, but certainly not the best. My advice, rent it if you are not sure. But, if you not sure and need one more reason to get it, get it for the Last Man Standing match between McMahon/Big Show. That was one hell of a leap from the 50ft Backlash superstructure.",992044800,,765,4.510791366906475

1396521,4,B000055ZKA,"Everybody says this ppv was not good.  This was a very solid ppv that is very entertaining!!  Here is a match-by-match run down:
1) SIX MAN TAG MATCH - Dudleys VS X-Factor
This match was a very good opening match.  Justin Credible's performance was very good.
2) HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - Rhyno (c) VS Raven
This was perhaps the greatest hardcore match in years!  This match was not one of those 30 men brawls.  It was one-on-one great hardcore action!
3) DUCHESS OF QUEENSBERRY RULES MATCH - William Regal VS Y2J
This match was a screw-job to Y2J.  It was entertaining but the outcome didn't please the audience.
4) 30 MINUTES ULTIMATE SUBMISSION MATCH - Benoit VS Angle
This match was a GREAT ""wrestling"" match.  Some said it was boring, but you have to stay with it.  Great finish!!
5) LAST MAN STANDING MATCH - Shane McMahon VS Big Show
Shane McMahon delivers his usual BUMP.  This was right up there with his SummerSlam 2000 bump.  Good finish!
6) TRIPLE THREAT FOR EUROPEAN TITLE - Matt Hardy (c) VS Christian VS Eddie Guerrero
Not a bad Triple Threat.  This match was basically used to calm the crowd down before the main event.
7) THREE TITLES ON THE LINE - Austin & Triple H VS Undertaker & Kane
The match's finish was not what I expected, but the overall match was great!  It ended in a usual McMahon screw-job.  The finish was not clean.  The match was not bad considering the main event was a tag match.
The overall event was pretty good.  None of the matches were boring!  It is well worth buying!  It is not as bad as everyone says.",991699200,4,1550,4.459074733096085
1396522,3,B000055ZKA,"WWE Backlash 2001 came off of Wrestlemania 17 twenty-nine days after without to many expectations, for what was expected of the pay per view (ppv) I believe it came off pretty well, I think it is underrated by most people. Below is a review of all the matches, the overall extra features and the overall DVD, hopefully it will help you decide if u should buy this DVD or not. The review will not directly give away who wins any of the matches but the winner may seem pretty obvious by my explanations of the matches.
( Match Reviews )
--- 6-Man Tag-Team Championship Match - Bubba, Devon and Spike Dudley Vs X-Pac, Justin Credible and Albert ---
This match was good, it had a little high risk in it, a couple of cool moves and the ending was clean enough making this a pretty good match. After the match a table was used to fulfill the Chicago crowds needs. (5.5/10)
--- Hardcore Championship Match - Raven Vs Rhyno ---
This match was a great hardcore match, no interference's, just one on one hard hitting hardcore action, Rhyno had to gore a steal chair and a shopping cart to finally gore Raven once. Its is amazing how one shopping cart basically made this match as it was used in many awesome ways. Definitely an above average match by two ECW animals. (8/10)
--- Dutchess of Queensberry Rules Match - Chris Jericho Vs William Regal ---
This was another good match despite the rules being changed randomly threw out it, there was lots of action and it was well paced. It was quite a bit better then I expected it to be. (6/10)
--- 30-Minute Ultimate Submission Match - Chris Benoit Vs Kurt Angle ---
This match is great for what it is, lots of counter wrestling and submissions, the pace was slow at parts due to the 30 minute time limit but when the pace decided to pick up, its took off. Good performance. (7/10)
--- Last Man Standing Match - Shane Mcmahon Vs Big Show ---
I found most of this match rather boring, Big show took lots of abuse in this match, tons of kendo sticks and chair shots. As boring as I thought the beginning of this match was the ending was just nuts, Shane Mcmahon did a elbow drop off the very top of the 35 foot titan tron, despite the fact that Shane just barely touched Big Show with that elbow drop, its still one of the craziest things I have seen in wrestling. However as a whole match it wasn't so good, although the elbow drop adds a lot. (6.5)
--- Triple-Threat European Championship Match - Matt Hardy Vs Christian Vs Eddie Guerrero ---
Nothing to special about this match, it could have been a lot better, the pace was pretty good though. I think the match would be better without the interference's. Jeff Hardy almost completely missed his swanton bomb while attempting to help his brother. Pretty good match. (5.5/10)
---Heavyweight, IC and Tag Team Championship Match - Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H Vs Undertaker and Kane ---
The main event was boring. The action was slow and the ending was predictable. Contains some good action but for the most part this match is a sleeper. (3.5/10)
( Extra Features )
There is a very limited amount of extra features on this DVD, included is basically all the interviews and matches of Sunday Night Heat which aired before the ppv and match histories which are actually already in the PPV. The matches are actually pretty good, the first one is a cruiserweight match with the debut of Jerry Lyn Vs Crash Holly and the second is an great women's match between Lita and Molly Holly. Overall you are basically just getting the Sunday Night Heat before Backlash since that's where all the special features came from. Nothing special but once again, good women's match. (4/10)
( Overall DVD )
This is an average DVD, the special features are weak, so is the main event, but there are a few good matches to see and a amazing bump done by Shane Mcmahon that make this DVD worth being watched at least once. Its really up to you to decide if this is a DVD for you to buy or not, I'm just trying to help you come up with a decision.",991440000,,4017,4.437077131258458
1396523,3,B000055ZKA,"This pay-per-view had some matches I was really looking forward to and some which I had no expectations for.  ....
Opener, X-factor vs. Dudley's:  A real surprise.  It looked like it was gonna be a real stinker but turned out to be a very good opener. ***1/2*
Hardcore matct: Raven vs. Rhyno: Rhyno is being used perfectly.  He can't put together a real one on one match but is awesome in the hardcore division.  Raven also works well in the hardcore match but I'd rather see him in the running for the IC or tag team belts.  Awesome match though. ****1/4*
Regal vs. Jericho:  This could have been a great match but the goofy stipulations just plain killed it.  It was watchable but a real disapointment. *3/4*
Benoit vs. Angle: Another disappointment. It's still a great match but just isn't up to the level of quality I've come to expect from these two.  Would have been a better match if there had been less stalling by angle, had been moves other then submission moves and if there had been more crazy submission moves.  If you want to see a real awesome submission matches get Judgement day 2000 or wrestlemania 13... ***3/4*
Big Show vs. Shane: ....Shane should save his crazy bumps for a real match against a real opponent. *
Mat Hardy vs. Cristian vs. Eddie Guerrero: Awesome but they didn't give them enough time to do anything.  Should have shaved a few minutes off of the main event and given it to these guys.
Undertaker and Kane vs Austin and Tripple H: Not the worst match of the night....  *3/4*
Overall a pretty ok show thats worth picking up. ....",990316800,,1564,4.526690391459074
1396524,3,B000055ZKA,"Personally I think this PPV was good,but it was never so good as the 3 other ppv's this year. The PPV starts of with X-Factor(X-Pac,Albert & Justin Credible) vs. The Dudley Boyz(Bubba Ray,D-Von & Spike). This was a solid match, but not great. X-Factor wins,after the match,The Dudleyz 3-D X-Pac thru a table-->6.5/10
Then, we have the former ECW stars against each other. Raven challenges Rhyno for the Hardcore Title. Rhyno misses the Gore a few times(even in a supermarket car) but gives Raven later an amazing Gore. Rhyno wins and retains the title-->8.5/10
Next up,The Duchess of Queensburry Rules Match with William Regal & Y2J. This is just a cheap rip off of WCW's New Blood Rising 2000 match between Mike Awesome & Lance Storm. Jericho wins a few times, but the Duchess changes the rules. Regal wins after a few chairshots.-->7/10
Then, the best match of the night. 30 minute Ultimate Submission Match with Benoit & Angle. Benoit taps quick in the match. After 30 minutes, the score is 3 against 3. In over time, Benoit locks in the crossface to win the match.-->10/10
Last Man Standing:Shan-vs-Big Show. Shane wins with help from Test and an AMAZING elbow drop of the titan tron(but he misses the Show completely)-->7/10
European Title Match:Christian-vs-Eddie Guerrero-vs-Matt Hardy. Hardy retains the title after he pins Guerrero after the twist of fate-->5/10
World,Tag & IC title Match:Stone Cold & Triple H-vs-Kane & Undertaker. Bit boring match,Kane kicks Stephanie in the face. Austin & HHH win the tag titles after Triple H pins Kane-->6.5/10

1396525,4,B000055ZKA,"The WWF presents Backlash, with what I believe to be one of the worst booked main events in history.  The match ended up being ok but it didn't have it all.

1396526,5,B000055ZKA,Not the best Backlash I have seen(WWF Backlash 1999 was better). Many people were excited about the HHH/Austin vs. Undertaker/Kane match. It was obvious that HHH & Austin would come out as champions. I was really disappointed with the match (even though i am a huge HHH fan)...,989452800,,277,4.791666666666667
1396527,1,B000055ZKA,"It's amazing. At some points in history, Vince McMahon has been an incredible genius. Wrestlemania X-7 was perhaps one of the greatest WWF pay per views in a longgggg time. Vince gave his team 29 days however to essentially build all new storylines and feuds as there were two rematches from Wrestlemania in William Regal my personal favorite in WWF right now vs Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit. Perhaps a total set of rematches from wrestlemania with different stipulations would have been a much better PPV then what Backlash was. Your typical Raw is War is actually worth more of your time then Backlash simply because the card was entirely predictable for every match. The card opened up with a six man tag, nothing out of the ordinary, no table rules, no hard core rules, just ur simple boring opening match that really set a bad tone for the rest of the card. The next match pitted Raven vs Rhyno for the Hard Core Title. Definitly one of the highlights of the night but I personally thought the Hard Core Match at Wrestlemania was much more entertaining. Rhyno took some incredible bumps throughout the match.
Next we come to perhaps the most entertaining spot of the night, The Duchess of Queensbury Rules matchup between William Regal and Chris Jericho. Personally I thought the match itself had some very decent wrestling moves for both individuals but it was perhaps Regal's comedic Duchess making the rules along the match that kept you entertained throughout the match.
The next match was Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit and a 30 man ultimate submission match. Good concept but poorly executed. Very predictable throughout the match but it was basically watching amateur submission holds throughout the match. No real huge wrestling moves such as Benoit's infamous headbutt or the Angle olympic slam which I found really dissapointing. Definitly the match to make some popcorn in up until around the last 5 minutes.
Big Show vs Shane is just really another poor episode in the Big Show's WWF career taking the job to Shane McMahon, sorry about the spoiler but if I'm the only one who didn't see that one coming then wrestling fans have certainatly changed. Big Show really needs to think about a gimmick reevaluation, not a bad fall by Shane at the end but nothing compared to Foley's infamous falls. You could tell Shane really didn't plan it out as he basically jumped off the Scaffold and landed almost nowhere near the Big Show yet somehow got the pin from it? Pretty bad in my views.
Matt Hardy defended his newly won Europeon Title vs Christian and Eddie Guerrero in a triple threat match.  This was perhaps the most unpredictable match of the night as all 3 of these individuals really had a equal chance of winning the title.  The problem with this match though is it has 3 days of hype behind it.  3 days of hype?  And it's the match before the main event on a WWF Pay Per View?  Paleeeeeeze.
Finally to me perhaps the most dissapointing main event since Armageddon Hell in the Cell as it was WWF's sole hype up for the pay per view as 3 titles were on the line. It's no wonder that the WWF could not pull off a great pay per view here as they're three most prestigious titles were determined in one normal no stipulation tag team match between Undertaker/Kane and HHH/Austin. Yes you heard me right, the Tag Team, Intercontinental, and World Titles were all on the line in this match. Did anyone really expect HHH to lose the IC Title in the Main Event of a pay per view? To my knowledge in watching wrestling for 10 years I have never seen the IC Title change in the main event of a pay per view, come to think of it, I've never heard of the IC Title being on the line in the main event. Also, did anyone really think that Steve Austin would lose the World Title after just winning it 29 days ago at the biggest pay per view of the new millenium? So this basically left one possible outcome, Kane and the Undertaker who had just won the Tag Team Titles only ""1 WEEK AGO"" prior to the Pay Per View to lose their tag team titles to HHH and Austin. Again sorry about the spoiler but I found this to be even more predictable then Show/Shane and at least Show/Shane had a good bump at the end. This was perhaps next to the opening bout the most boring match of the evening. Definitly save your 15 dollars, go out and take your significant other out for dinner and put 2 1/2 hours of your life to good use.",989366400,,4432,4.507462686567164
1396528,3,B000055ZKA,"Backlash didn't, in my opinion, have much to live up to, because there was no real hype for any match besides the main event, as most of the matches were made on Raw or Smackdown right before the PPV with no history or ongoing fued. However it was pretty good, yet not great.
X-Factor vs. The Dudley Boyz was nothing special, a very average match, possibly not worthy of making it to PPV, but it was an OK opener and X-Pac getting wood got a decent pop from the crowd. 2 out of 5 stars.
Rhyno vs. Raven was the best Hardcore Title Match I've seen in a LONG time, very well done by both involved, but I personally found it hard to get into becuase there was ZERO history between the two. Awsome spots, very entertaining. 4 out of 5 stars.
Jericho vs. Regal wasn't very good. The match was so obvious and easy to call, and was pretty boring. The gimmick was awful and the whole boring match was very predictable. 1.5 out of 5 stars.
Benoit vs. Angle in the ultimate submission match displayed some great submission holds and mat work, but I think it is way overrated (as is their WM X-7 match). It was really boring at some points, and was way too long. 3.5 out of 5 stars.
Shane vs. Big Show was pointless. There was no reason why these two should be fighting at all, besides the fact that Big Show needed a match and a Shane bump is always awsome. Shane takes a sick bump in an otherwise crappy match. 1.5 (w/o bump), 3.5 (w bump) out of 5 stars.
Matt Hardy vs. Christian vs. Eddie Gurrero was okay. No history makes it pointless. Why waste time with Matt Hardy in singles action? Everyone likes Jeff better... Okay for a triple threat but too short. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
Stone Cold and Triple H vs. Undertaker and Kane ... so much I can't describe it. It was just a really long Raw main event, only it eas worse because the length made it boring. Undertaker and Stone Cold need to retire. They're average brawlers with three moves they pull off half the time, with annoying redneck gimmicks. I'm also not buying this...SCSA. 1.5 out of 5 stars.

1396529,3,B000055ZKA,"First off, Wrestlemania X-7 (best ppv of all time, for sure, my last time saying that) was a tough act to follow, and Backlash came to us with not as much hype, but some lofty expectations.  At points it succeeded, at points it failed.  The 6 Man Tag between X Factor and The Dudleyz to kick us off was good.  Next was Raven vs. Rhyno in a Hardcore title match was spectacular.  Great match.  Next up was the Duchess of Queensbery Rules match between Y2J Chris Jericho vs. William Regal in an ok match.  Next was the Ultimate Submission Match between Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle in a purely outstanding match.  Next was The Last Man Standing Match between Shane McMahon vs. The Big Show which was a solid match and the greatest bump I have ever seen in my life!!! Next was Matt Hardy vs Christian vs Eddie Guererro for the European title.  An ok match.  Finally, WWF World Title, Intercontinental Title, and Tag Titles are on the line as Austin and HHH vs. Undertaker and Kane in a very dissapointing main event.  Not as brutal as it was led on to be.

X-Pac and Justin Credible hit Bubba with the X Marks The Spot and X-Pac gets the pinfall win. The Dudleyz jump X-Factor following the match and X-Pac gets 3D'd through a table to make the crowd happy

2.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Rhyno (c) vs Raven

Another bout involving 2 ECW originals as Raven and Rhyno went at it for the Hardcore Title in this next match. Hardcore matches with Raven were always fun to watch because he always came to the ring with his shopping cart full of weapons. The crowd loved this match, Paul Heyman especially loved this match, and I did too! There were a lot of sick shots that were definitely cringe worthy. The shopping cart became played a part in the end of the match and honestly, I thought Raven was going to kill Rhyno with it! Rhyno retains with a Gore on Raven in what was probably one of the best Hardcore matches in WWF/WWE history

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Duchess of Queensbury Rules Match: William Regal vs Chris Jericho

The feud between Jericho and Regal was turning out to be a great one. Both Regal and Jericho did some nice pre-match mic work that involved Jericho insulting the Queen (who looked ridiculous by the way). This match was a real treat for fans. Entertaining, solid, and dare I say, hilarious. The rules were never really explained but apparently you couldn't win by submission, there were no disqualifications. Basically the rules were meant to favor Regal and Regal only. Queensbury's Rules screw over Jericho, Jericho attacks the Queen and Regal gets the pinfall win with 3 chair shots to the back on Jericho

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) 30 Minute Ultimate Submission Match: Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit

In a follow-up to their Wrestlemania match, Angle and Benoit offer up another marvelous solid wrestling match, only this time it was all submissions! The Ankle Lock vs the Crossface. Which was the better submission was the question that was to be answered in this bout. Benoit and Angle go back and forth and practically break each other's necks trying to lock the other in a variety of submissions. After the match is tied 3-3, the referee takes the match into sudden death, treating the fans to a proper end. Benoit ends up getting the overtime win with the Crossface, making for a great ending to what is without a doubt the match of the night.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Last Man Standing Match: Big Show vs Shane McMahon

Not bad of a Last Man Standing Match. Vince gets involved and nails Shane with a chair. Just as Big Show seems like he's going to win, Test interferes and aids Shane throughout the match. Nearing the end, Test knocks out Big Show on a padding like structure while Shane scales the scaffold. What follows is Shane being the only daredevil he knows how to be and takes a breath taking 50 foot Leap of Fate from the top of the scaffold down onto Big Show. Test helps Shane to his feet and Shane wins the match. This match reminded me a lot of Shane and Show's Judgment Day 2000 match with Shane winning with the help of Test. Like I said, not bad of a match but it gets a gold star, solely for Shane's death drop. It truly surprises me that Shane didn't die or at least severely injure himself for all those times he did those death drops

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF European Championship Match: Matt Hardy (c) vs Christian vs Eddie Guerrero

Nice, quick and to the point match. 1/2 of the Hardyz, 1/2 of Edge and Christian vs Eddie Guerrero. Eddie and Christian worked over Matt early on in the match but it eventually became every man for himself. Interferences from Edge and Jeff Hardy play a factor in the end of the match that leads to Matt retaining with a Twist of Fate on Christian

Following Wrestlemania, some probably expected a Austin vs Rock rematch to take place here but that was not the case. Rock took time off for Hollywood, while Austin and Triple H, 2 rivals, formed the Two Man Power Trip and got involved in a feud with WWF's 2nd top Tag Team, the Brothers of Destruction. I don't care what anyone says about this match. It was a classic! These 4 in the ring battling for the top 4 championships of the company was a great way to end the show! A lot of awesome back and forth brawling is featured throughout this match that looked to be either team's match at many points. In the end, Triple H gets the win following a sledgehammer shot to the head of Kane and the Two Man Power Trip own all 4 titles!

Overall: A pretty good Backlash with the only slacker of a match being Shane vs Big Show. Honestly, the only noteworthy thing about the match was Shane's drop. The rest of the matches on the PPV delivered. A decent opener, followed by a killer Hardcore match with an amazing 30 minute Ultimate Submission Match, a great bout between Jericho and Regal and a classic main event makes this PPV a 5 star event",1398902400,,5855,5.116352201257862
7931700,4,B000055ZKA,"Just about every match in ""Backlash 2001"" is something you wouldn't ordinarily see on WWF TV back then, let alone today.  It's one of those events that throws everything at the wall to see what sticks.  The good news is that most of it works, making this 3 hours well spent.

1) The Dudleyz (Bubba Ray, D-Von, Spike) v.
X-Factor (X-Pac, Justin Credible, Albert)
---This opener was fairly by-the-numbers back in 2001, because these curtain jerkers are meant to get a crowd going more than anything else.  On that basis, this 6-Man Tag Team match still works.  The whole match moves along at a nice pace, and isn't boring at all.  That said, if you've followed some of the WWF's programming from 2000-2002, The Dudleyz' table gimmick was getting predictable by now (in my opinion, anyway).  But on the whole, the night gets off on a fun note; if not for you, it'll be over before you know it.
""6.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

2) Hardcore Championship
Rhyno (champion) v. Raven
---""OUCH"" is the key word here.  Man, these two just wail on each other with weapons, and cause almost as much harm to themselves when they fail to pull off a deadly attack.  Some could call this a ""garbage match"", meaning there's not much in the way of storytelling, and it's all about props and exciting action.  I have to admit that I used to love this match a lot more, but that was back when I wasn't into slower-paced technical wrestling.  Now I see two tough guys just beating each other senseless.  I still really like it, and commend the grueling effort, but have to admit that hard-hitting action is all this Hardcore Title bout is.
""7.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

3) Duchess of Queensbury Rules
William Regal (WWF Commissioner) v. Chris Jericho
---I love this whole storyline, honestly.  Jericho is going to compete in a match that only William Regal knows the rules!  That's is hilarious, in my book.  But all the ringside shenanigans aside, the match is just as crisp and balanced as their ""WrestleMania X-Seven"" opener.  It's easy to forget how great Regal used to be in his prime; Jericho, on the other hand, was always extremely talented.  I think this grudge match is a strong athletic matchup with some good comedy thrown in.
""8.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

4) 30-Minute Submission Match
Kurt Angle v. Chris Benoit
---The concept is simple but gutsy: The wrestler who can make his opponent submit (or ""tap out"") the most times will win the match.  I have to admit that I used to find this match very overrated when I was a younger viewer.  I loved both of these superstars, but just found this whole match to be slow.  But later in life, I rewatched this beloved classic, and realized just how difficult it was to execute, and how creative it really was.  It asks the audience to sit down, be patient, and pay attention to every single hold and maneuver.  After all, a submission score could happen at any moment.  I've watched this match many times, and am constantly amazed at how these two managed to pull it off, because there's very little in the way of striking or high-spots.  It's a pure grappling contest in the spirit of MMA, and I doubt anyone but Angle & Benoit could've delivered.  I will admit that around the 25-minute mark, I've had my fill of this Ultimate Submission Match.  Only when a few minutes remain do I sense any kind of stalling.  It's a small gripe, but I don't want to give the impression that this is a perfect match, by any means.  Frankly, this is one of the toughest matches to recommend because, from my point of view, it requires a particular audience.  But if you wanna see how tough these guys are, and want to watch a match that tests what kind of WWE fan you are, then sit back and watch it unfold.
""9.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

5) Last Man Standing Match
Big Show v. Shane McMahon (WCW Owner)
---I have to admit that as much as I admire Shane's courage and toughness, I enjoy very few of his matches (yes, the KOTR 2001 Street Fight is definitely a classic).  I kinda liked the storyline, where Vince McMahon is still bitter over losing at ""WrestleMania X-Seven"", not to mention the WCW contract (in the script, anyway).  I was enjoying myself when Shane was making a strong first impression, and finding creative ways to keep Big Show down.  But once Show gained the upper hand, this became a very boring match for me.  And when Test interferes, he basically does all the work, until Shane does a daredevil highspot that no man should attempt.  I guess if you're a Shane-O-Mac fan, or just wanna see Big Show beaten around, then this'll be a good one.  I personally got tired after awhile, and wasn't wowed enough when all was said and done.
""5.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

6) European Championship
Matt Hardy (champion) v. Christian v. Eddie Guerrero
---And the award for most random match goes to...THIS ONE!  I don't even think this title bout was advertised before the PPV began.  In all seriousness, this is a decent 3-way match with some neat spots and a breezy pace.  I just wish it didn't feel like it was thrown together at the last minute.  There's really just nothing to say about this match.  It's there.  It's fairly enjoyable.  It's over.  You don't remember a whole lot about it afterwards.
""6.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

7) Three Titles On The Line
Triple H (Intercontinental champion)
& 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin (WWF champion)
v. Kane & The Undertaker (Tag Team champions)
---The WWF used a similar concept at ""King of the Ring 2000"", but this time, every wrestler involved has something to gain and something to lose.  The storyline was bizarre but intriguing: Steve Austin joined forces with Vince McMahon AND Triple H, both of whom he had bad blood with.  Kane & Undertaker were apparently the only guys tough enough to take them on.  Once the match starts, it takes a while for HHH & Austin to gain any kind of momentum.  The Tag champs just stop them in their tracks time and again.  Eventually, the Austin/HHH combo managed to gain some advantages.  Like most main events from the Attitude Era, all hell broke loose, leading to a run-in or two, and a chaotic finish.  So, what did I think about this main event?  I liked what I saw, but I really wish we got more of a straight-up showdown where both teams looked impressive from the getgo.  I can't help but think that WWF really dropped the ball with a possible all-star atmosphere.  Instead, these men went for something a bit more challenging, and for the most part, it works.  The match is pretty lenghty, which sometimes makes it drag, other times give you the feel of an epic battle.  The match starts humorously, which is great because it's Austin & HHH getting tossed around, but is also annoying because it's freaking TRIPLE H AND STEVE AUSTIN!  I like this match, was satisfied with what I saw, and recommend it to those who haven't seen it.  I just think a much better match was possible if a different approach was taken.
""7.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

To call ""Backlash 2001"" my least favorite event of 2001 may seem like an insult, but it's really not.  2001 was a fantastic year for the WWF, and ""Backlash"" is a worthwhile PPV.  You get Hardcore action, a technical wrestling clinic, a couple throwaway crowd-pleasers, a comedy match, a David/Goliath fight, and a star-packed main event.  The WWF took a lot of chances with this PPV, which main explain why this PPV doesn't seem to gel together like the better WWF/WWE PPVs.  But then again, if it weren't for the risk-taking, we might not have been privileged to see such a diverse card.",1292025600,2,7718,4.735382308845577

7931702,4,B000055ZKA,"6-Man Tag Match: Dudleyz vs. X-Factor (X-Pac, Albert, Justin Credible)
I definitely appreciated the ECW nostalgic vibe surrounding the moments when the Dudleyz and Justin Credible got to work together. I just wish that Credible could have brought his signature barbed wire to the dance. Otherwise, it's a very solid opener with each combatant getting plenty of time to show off their skills. It's downright criminal that WWE didn't do more with Justin. Oh, well. WWE has let a lot of great talent slip through their fingers. ::cough Christian Cage cough::
6 out of 10

Hardcore Championship Match
Rhyno (Champion) vs. Raven
A tremendous hardcore match! If the WWE could have kept up this caliber of match for the hardcore title, it never would have been disposed of. This match had all the energy and excitement of an ECW title match with two of it's best competitors. Some tremendous spots including the Gore from the steel steps, the Gore to the shopping cart and some really sick chair shots. ECW! ECW! ECW!
8 out of 10

Triple Threat European Championship Match
Matt Hardy (Champion) vs. Christian vs. Eddie Guerrero
This match was the first time that I knew that these three would grow into main-eventers. They put on a tremendous show of high-risk offense with a great level of drama added with Jeff Hardy and Edge on the outside.
9 out of 10

Duchess of Queensberry Rules Match
William Regal vs. Chris Jericho
These two had a great chemistry in the ring. They made up for their all-too-quick WrestleMania X-Seven encounter by taking their time with this one. I love the gimmick behind the match with the ""Duchess"" showing  up and JR's cynicism. A very crowd-driven match. Some great technical wrestling between these two as well.
9 out of 10

30-Minute Ultimate Submission Match
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
This is one of the greatest wrestling matches I have ever seen or will ever see. These two, who stole any show they were on together, put on a technical masterpiece. It wouldn't have hurt my feelings if this match went another thirty minutes. It's a crying shame that this match will be forgotten now that WWE has invoked their ""Pretend Benoit Never Existed"" policy. The last five minutes actually made me leave my seat and almost break a sweat.
11 out of 10

Last Man Standing Match
Shane McMahon vs. Big Show
Well, as is the case most of the time in David and Goliath matches, a very boring slow start with a surprising finish. And my God, what a finish! That fall Shane takes is UNREAL!!! As for the rest of the match, it's completely forgettable and nothing worth talking about.
8 out of 10 (Only for the ending spot, without that, it would probably be 1 or 2 out of 10)

Three Titles on the Line
Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF Champion) and Triple H (IC Champ) vs. Undertaker and Kane (WWF Tag Champs)
My, how the mighty have fallen. It's almost painful to watch Taker and Austin work together in this match. Taker moves across the ring with all the speed and ferocity of a slug on Ritalin. And it's a shame to see Austin degenerate back to his old, stale self after having two of the best matches of his career at No Way Out and Mania. Kane is decent and works pretty well with Triple H. Much better than their encounter from No Mercy the next year. And as if the match wasn't disappointing enough, the ending is cheap and rehearsed.
5 out of 10

Overall, this is a very solid PPV. Worth the buy if you can find it relatively cheap.",1226793600,,3450,4.580226904376013
7931703,4,B000055ZKA,"With the appex of WWE's Attitude era winding down after WrestleMania X-7, we now have Backlash 2001. The Rock is off in Hollywood at this point, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin turned heel and has teamed with HHH and was turning WWE on its ear. The Hardy Boyz and Lita were a hot trio as well as Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit were beginning to come to the forefront as major players and we were a couple of months away from the ""Invasion.""

This card was one of the best Backlash's ever. Here is the run down:

Dudley Boyz w/ Spike vs. X-Pac, Justin Credible, & Albert - At this point, The Dudley Boyz (now Team 3D) were a trio of Bubba Ray, D-Von and Spike Dudley. I can remember they worked very well with X-Pac, Justin Credible and Albert (who were known as X-Factor at this point).

Raven Vs. Rhyno (Hardcore Title Match) - A very good ECW style bout! Has one sick scene where Rhyno gets stuck in a shopping cart trying to gore Raven! Ends with Rhyno retaining the title.

Chris Jericho Vs. William Regal - One half the ""Canadian Chris'"" took on then-WWE Commissioner William Regal on one of the most ridiculous concept matches I've ever seen! I didn't even watch it all the way through! I only know that Regal won by screwjob.

Kurt Angle Vs. Chris Benoit (30 Minute Ultimate Submission Match) - Recent events aside, this is still one of my favorite bouts to watch and its actually my favorite Benoit Vs. Angle encounter. Lots of submissions and holds used here. We even see Angle and Benoit use the other's signature moves (anklelock, crossface) to get submissions. Ends when Benoit gets the final fall in overtime by countering a mat version of abdominal stretch by Angle into the crossface for the tapout.

Shane McMahon Vs. The Big Show (Falls Count Anywhere) - Standard Shane brawl with weapons. Not boring but nothing that special. Ends when Shane dives off the top of TitanTron onto TBS (with help from Test) with an elbowsmash for the pin.

Matt Hardy Vs. Eddie Guerrero Vs. Christian (WWE European Title Match) - Pretty good match but a bit short. This was Matt's first singles title in WWE at that time and I was expecting more of a match than we got. Still was good though.

The Undertaker/Kane Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin/HHH (All Titles On The Line) - Basically, it was the WWE World, I-C and Tag Titles up for grabs here. The fans were into this one and it was better than expected. Ends with HHH and Austin winning and becoming tag team champions, making HHH only the second man to be a Grand Slam winner.

Overall, not a bad card to get if you can find it for a decent price.",1223337600,,2605,4.467368421052631
7931704,4,B000055ZKA,"Backlash 2001 had many awesome matches and it was a very good follow up to Mania X-Seven. This Backlash could be the best in the Backlash ppv's.

1. Six Man Tag
Dudley Boyz w/ Spike vs. X-Pac, Justin Credible, & Albert
A strong and solid opener. Lots of good action for eveybody here. The Dudley Boyz including Spike all looked very good and they did not missed a step here. X-Pac gets 3D through a table after the match. 4/5

2. Hardcore Title
Raven vs. Rhyno
This is one of the best wwe hardcore title matches ever in my view. There was a bunch load of great hardcore action and weapon use. Rhyno takes a sickening shot into a shopping cart in trying to gore Raven. Great match. 4.5/5

3. Duchess of Queensberry Rules Match
Chris Jericho vs. William Regal
What a stupid concept of a match. If you ignor all of the stupid rules the Duchess was making up all through the match, this was a pretty darn good match between these two. Regal is a fine wrestler and he knows how to keep a match entertaining, same with jericho. Some nice submissions and suplexes. Regal got in some cheap shots but so did Jericho. Just take away the whole Duchess part, this is a good match to watch. 4/5

4. 30 Minute Ultimate Submission Match
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit
These two put on another classic match up once again. I wouldn't say this match is better than their Mania match but it is different. Of course both men went for submissions right away. Both was able to escape out of a lot of tap out situations and each other's finishers. The action even got taken to the outside where some brawling and action takes place. Once Angle got the upper hand he tryed to use the clock for the advantage and use it against Benoit. Benoit fought his heart out in the last closing minutes of the match. A classic bout which ended in sudden death. Match of the night for me. 5/5

5. Last Man Standing- Shane McMahon vs. Big Show
Just your standard Shane McMahon match with kendo sticks and other things. Mr. McMahon would interfere which would give Show the upper hand on Shane. Test would come out too and try to help Shane. The highlight of the match was of course when Shane jumped off a 65 foot scapfold onto the big show for the win. That move right there made the whole match for me. 3.5/5

6. European Title
Eddie Guerrero vs. Matt Hardy vs. Christian
Pretty good title match. Good action from all three men. Nice way to set up for the main event. 3.75/5

7. WWE Title Intercontinental Title & Tag Team Titles
Undertaker & Kane vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin & Triple H w/ Stephanie
This match was defiantely better than expected. Kane looked very good but he was also for sure selling his arm injury all the way through and it came into affect at the end. Lots of brawling from both teams. The match got taken to the outside a couple of times. Kane and Taker had some miscues here and there. The fans was really into this one which added more the match. Another thing, Triple H became the second grand slam champion with this match. This match defiantely surpassed all of my expectations. A very good main event. 5/5

Backlash is a good ppv. This is one I recommend.",1221350400,,3146,4.375

Sunday Night HeAT
Jerry Lynn vs Crash Holly
At barely under 3 minutes, this was better than most of what you'd see on an average episode of Raw, Smackdown, or ECW today.  (6/10)

Molly Holly vs Lita
Without a doubt the single greatest women's match in the WWF I've ever seen, and yet it was barely given more than 3 minutes or so.  Far and away better than most of the work done by so-called ""world champions"" today.  (10/10)

The Dudley Boys vs X-Factor
Great match, a great showing of the Dudley Boys's talent.  Unfortunately, X-Factor shows little beyond being decent workers for jobbing.  Justin Credible is badly watered down from his ECW days, and Albert is a great show of power, but has little else going for him.  Spike barely got to do much.  (7/10)

WWF Hardcore Championship
Rhyno (C) vs Raven
A little slab of old ECW for us.  Without a doubt, this was the sickest, stiffest, and most awesome/cringe-inducing hardcore match I've ever seen.  Both men were badly stiffing each other with some of the roughest and hardest weapon shots and strikes I've ever seen, and two of the absolute sickest bumps on Rhyno not involving falling from high spots or botching moves:
- Bump 1: A leap off the top steps onto Raven sitting in a chair---Raven moves out of the way, Rhyno crashed into the chair.  That he didn't break his legs is a miracle.
- Bump 2: A full-speed Gore through the rear end of a shopping cart.  (10/10)

Duchess of Queensbury Rules Match
William Regal vs Chris Jericho
Aside from the stupidity of the gimmick to this, and the ugliness of the ""duchess"" this was a barely average match.  (5.5/10)

30 Minute Ultimate Submission Match
Kurt Angle
This was not as good as their Wrestlemania X7 match, but worlds better than their Royal Rumble 2003 match.  In a truly professional way, these two paced the match without it lagging and getting horribly boring (like Shawn Michaels did with those rounds of 10 minute headlocks at Wrestlemania 21).  A perfect exercise of professional technical wrestling.  My only complaint, a dubious one at best, was a seeming emphasis solely on getting submission moves in as much as possible.  (10/10)

Last Man Standing
The Big Show vs Shane McMahon
Apparently and obviously the only highlight of this otherwise average match was Shane McMahon climbing to the top of the titantron and diving off the top nearly fifty feet in the air.  (6/10)

WWF European Championship
Matt Hardy (C) vs Christian vs Eddie Guerrero
Why, another reviewer asked, was this match on the card?  Maybe because it was one of the best in the evar?!?!?! I scream back.  Undoubtedly, this was the best triple threat match I've seen from the WWF/WWE.  Unlike typical formula, it didn't go with two men battling while one lay around outside the ring like he'd been slammed with a sledgehammer---all three worked with perfect cohesion and fluid motion, shifting places for some one-on-one battles, with plenty of roundabout 2 on 1, 1 on 1 on 1s and so on for a fast-paced high quality wrestling match.  (10/10)

WWF Championship + WWF Intercontinental Championship + WWF Tag Team Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin (C) and Triple H (C) vs The Undertaker (C) and Kane (C)
I was skeptical on this one, after the debacle that was The Rock, Kane, Undertaker vs The McMahons and Triple H at King of the Ring 2000, but the difference here is the great workmanship of a then non-McMahon-married Triple H and a freshly heel Stone Cold Steve Austin.  This was a classic WWF style brawl and powerfest by men peaking in their prime, with plenty of psychology and athleticism in a match like this.  And I still marvel at Calaway's perfect balance on the top rope.  (9/10)",1209686400,,3699,4.702954898911353
