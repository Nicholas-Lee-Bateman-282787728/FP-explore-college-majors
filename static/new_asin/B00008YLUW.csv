7988056,5,B00008YLUW,"This is a very nice collection of material!  The first two discs are public-domain material, and are great for providing material for student video reports.  Incidentally, these two discs were released by Diamond Entertainment under the title ""Fantastic 50's Collection"" (94807); readily available for around $12 or less.  Quality is identical-the two differ only in their menus. (The more expensive version is much easier to navigate!)",1207094400,8,436,5.575757575757576
