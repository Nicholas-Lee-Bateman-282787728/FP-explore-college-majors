5904143,4,B00ECYLUCM,"After eyeballing her sensational performance as a traumatized British war orphan in 1942's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-For-Margaret/dp/B003NNGFWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey For Margaret</a>, MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer had a notion to fashion young Margaret O'Brien as the next Shirley Temple. I frankly don't see it. Margaret O'Brien was a more dramatic, more soulful child actor. Doesn't mean she's better than Shirley Temple, just different. But when Mayer went to his writers and commanded them to Temple-ize her, out came 1943's LOST ANGEL.

The professors at the Pickering Institute of Child Psychology are conducting a clinical study which may revolutionize the educational systems of the world. They posit that the early years of a child's life are wasted on the ""personalized hit-or-miss methods of the average parent."" The experiment revolves around an abandoned baby that the institute's staff determines to raise scientifically and in isolation.

The story really picks up when a newspaperman interviews the now six-year-old prodigy. For the flighty, smooth-talking Mike Regan (James Craig), meeting Alpha is just another assigment and some ink for the New York Morning Transcript. But his conversation with Alpha intrigues her enough that she decides to sneak out of the institution and experience real life. Out in the bustling streets of New York, she goes looking for Mike Regan. Maybe it's a good thing she's run away as a case of the measles soon quarantines Pickering Institute.

The child may have been raised absent of sentimentality, but there's plenty of hokum in this film. But you'd have to have a heart the size of a shriveled lump to disdain the fuzzy warmth and the old school nostalgia and the preciousness and theatrics of Margaret O'Brien. She's very cute. There's fun in watching the precocious Alpha explore the outside world and affect everyone around her. You can count on her to overhaul a confirmed bachelor like Mike, a commitment phobe who'd been forever stringing along his long-suffering nightclub torch singer of a girlfriend Katie Mallory (Marsha Hunt). He's not too enthused when he's coaxed into keeping Alpha for a few days until the quarantine's lifted.

You may have to never mind the occasional moments of reckless child endangerment. Maybe halfway thru the film, Keenan Wynn steps in as a fugitive named ""Packy"" Roose. Packy's on the run but claims he's been framed for the murder rap. He holes up in Mike's digs and demands that Mike prove his innocence. We're then treated to humorous scenes of Alpha lecturing Packy on diverse subjects such as Napoleon and semantics and, later on, teaching him yoga. As you may suspect, Packy's heart is no shriveled lump.

LOST ANGEL is no hard-hitting social drama. It's an affectionate fairy tale of a film and infused with plenty of humor. It's the kind of movie where a sheltered little girl can hazard a night out in the big city and she finds kindness from strangers wherever she turns. So, yeah, it's a must that you dial down the cynicism when watching this picture. Alpha never does get exposed to the school of hard knocks. But she does get to hang out with Mike in a boxing arena and in a nightclub. She even gets to witness the police collar a murderer. She even gets to pig out on spaghetti. These are all better than measles.

And for those eagle-eyed classic film buffs, see if you can spot Ava Gardner's unbilled appearance and Bobby Driscoll's pre-Disney cameo (hint: she's the hatcheck girl, he's the kid on the train).",1378598400,5,3592,5.152658662092624

5904145,5,B00ECYLUCM,"I love watching old Margaret O'Brien movies. With the world crazy and out of control, it's nice to take a trip back in time to a place where the sense of right & wrong prevailed.",1451952000,,178,4.114285714285714
5904146,5,B00ECYLUCM,This movie is sweet and I love it. It is an old fashioned movie of child wonder with Margaret O' Brien as the lead character. I am 51 and as a child I watched this movie with my family.  I was crazy about Margaret and apparently I still am. The movie has professors raising an infant similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins but while she is still a child she learns about real life after running away for proof of her theorem. Her character is similar to Natalie wood in Miracle on 34th street.,1439683200,3,496,4.276595744680851

5904149,4,B00ECYLUCM,"Every time I watch this, I am amazed at the talent of Margaret O'Brien at such a young age! There is an intelligence in her little head, even in her earliest pictures. A mild commentary on the ""scientific approach"" to child rearing, this film follows the discovery of both the child and her guardians as they learn what happiness and security really mean in a child's life.",1428364800,3,373,4.582089552238806
5904150,5,B00ECYLUCM,"I was waiting decades for this to come out on DVD.  It's a must for any Margaret O'Brien fans.  I think it's her best performance, and she was only about 4 years old.",1427760000,,166,4.0
5904151,5,B00ECYLUCM,"This is the movie that introduced me to Margaret O'Brien. It's the perfect vehicle for her. The beginning is a bit stiff, but once the story gets to the nightclub, it really takes off. I love how the reporter uses a nickname to refer to the girl, rather than using her given name of Alpha. It creates an attachment to her that he doesn't realize until later.

There are some really great lines in the movie, too, but I won't spoil it by repeating them here.

And I am so grateful to Warner Bros. for releasing the M'OB movies on DVD, finally. Granted, they are on DVD+R (printed on demand). And the film blemishes have not been removed. But the cases and DVD artwork is top-notch. Fans of Margaret O'Brien via TCM now have a chance to own some great movies and show them to others.",1423785600,4,781,4.342465753424658

5904160,5,B00ECYLUCM,this is a lovely little film that film that can never be made today.  there is a sweet innocence  to the time that even the bad guys are good on the inside.  I really enjoyed it.,1390176000,,178,3.888888888888889
5904161,4,B00ECYLUCM,"While Marsha Hunt and James Craig are both likable second tier stars of the day, this is clearly Margaret O'Brien's show all the way.  The story idea is good, but a bunch of the scenes are a little sappy.  While they may not have worried as much about stranger danger back in 1943, there are some rather unbelievable lapses of judgement in the care of a six year old in this movie.  But most folks are probably going to see this for Margaret and she delivers.  The topper has to be her jealous display against Marsha Hunt in a night club that will have most folks laughing heartily.  Later she delivers the tears like no other child actor.  Shirley Temple may have been cute, but Margaret O'Brien really was an actress.",1389484800,6,719,4.450381679389313

8604100,5,B00ECYLUCM,"Came across this rather obscure, quirky movie on TCM and liked it a lot.  It's old enough that it doesn't  provide a clarity of picture anywhere near today's standards, but it was better than I thought it might be.

The story is about a little girl (Margaret O'Brien) who is taken in as a baby by some kind of institute whose purpose is to attempt perfect child-raising.  She has learned a vast body of knowledge by the age of six or seven but has had no contact with the outside world.  When she meets a reporter doing a story on her, her curiosity about the outside world is piqued and she takes off on her own.  Not surprisingly, their lives intersect again, and each of them learns something from the bond they form.",1459814400,,720,4.37593984962406
8604101,4,B00ECYLUCM,"This sweet and early Margaret O'Brien, James Craig, Marsha Hunt is precious and unique in subject matter and treatment.  My favorite 'early childhood' film!",1453852800,,156,5.5
