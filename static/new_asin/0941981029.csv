7793540,4,0941981029,"I was an initial investor in this film. It was in the can for just over a million dollars and Sony, the distributor, declined to take the risk
of distributing it, which would have cost millions. It is a dark movie with a number of today's stars. I'd give it a 3.5",1407801600,,263,4.076923076923077

7793542,4,0941981029,"IT IS ONE OF KATHERINE HEIGL'S EARLIER MOVIES BEFORE SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS A VERY FUNNY PERSON AND COULD USE HER TALENT IN THAT WAY, I BOUGHT IT JUST BECAUSE OF HER BUT ENJOYED IT ALL THE SAME.",1390435200,,193,3.9743589743589745
7793543,1,0941981029,"This movie started out as a play, which is rather obvious, given that it entirely takes place in one location/set: a bar where the stand-ins hang out. This movie is truly terrible. It just doesn't hold your attention and barely makes sense. I love period pieces, old Hollywood glamor, and I have actually worked as a Stand-in. None of that could save this truly abysmal piece. All of the characters are ridiculous and uninteresting. The small slivers of historical fact only serve to make you wish the story focused on any of them, rather than these ridiculous women. What's with the distracting, inaccurate, and stupid accents anyway? Save your time and money and rent something else.",1359244800,,685,4.913793103448276
