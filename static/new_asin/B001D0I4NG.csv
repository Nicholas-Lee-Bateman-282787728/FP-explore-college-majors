8290747,5,B001D0I4NG,as a fan of the old serials of the 30's & 40's i was intrigued by this modern production & decided to give it a try. whilst obviously made on a low budget it comes across as a real labour of love with knowing winks to serial traditions & cliches. never less than thoroughly enjoyable i watched it in one sitting & have revisited it a several times since. hoping this isn't the last we've seen of deborah. fingers crossed for a sequel.,1306022400,,434,4.240963855421687
8290748,1,B001D0I4NG,"I bought ""King Of The Park Rangers"" several years ago and found it to be good (it had it's problems, but not a bad first attempt at all).  I had hopes when I bought the latter made ""Dangers of Deborah"".  Boy was I wrong.  The acting went from stereotypical (the professor) to bad (the crimeologest) to hideous (Deborah) who could not ever pass muster in a high-school play.  They went from very limited and understated sound effects in the first one to stuff that sounds like it came from a 3 Stooges short.  The script was poor (as it was in the first one, we don't really watch serials  for the writting).  Let's review, bad acting, bad sound effect and bad writting.  Stay away.",1255737600,2,681,4.435483870967742
8290749,5,B001D0I4NG,"Lean Getz is a fantastic damsel in distress.  The story is fun and campy. I'll keep buying more ""Deborah"" as long as you make them. Keep up the great work!",1220054400,2,155,4.166666666666667
