8468886,1,B005ER6SRI,"I would give this no stars if I could. This is so badly transferred from an old tape. The first segment is at least watchable. It gets much worse MUCH,MUCH worse. Is Lou even aware of this travesty?",1337558400,2,198,4.2368421052631575
8468887,2,B005ER6SRI,"I am a Lou Reed fan but this DVD needed to be cleaned up much better.  It is almost unwatchable.  Get the ""Live At Montrenx 2000"", and let this one slip by.",1330732800,2,156,3.84375
8468888,2,B005ER6SRI,"As a big fan of The Velvet Underground and Lou Reed's '70s solo work I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this DVD. The video quality ranges from bad in the first segment to terrible in the second part. Audio quality is not much better and is only in stereo even though the case says there is a 5.1 mix. These shows were obviously recorded on magnetic tape which has greatly deteriorated over the years. I would only recommend this DVD to hardcore Lou Reed fans as the only positive aspects of it are seeing Lou during his ""Rock And Roll Animal"" incarnation and Steve Hunter's stellar guitar work.",1321920000,7,607,4.527272727272727
