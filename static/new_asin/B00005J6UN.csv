1427350,5,B00005J6UN,"This is the funnier of the two volumes of CR Show material.  This one includes the hilarious Baby One Credit sketch (e.g. ""I bought me a fur house!""), and the ""How not to get your *ss kicked by the Police"" sketch... those two alone worth the entire price of the DVD.
If you liked ""Bigger and Blacker"" or ""Bring the Pain"", you will love this!",1001894400,6,341,4.246153846153846
1427351,4,B00005J6UN,"This 2nd Volume of 'The Best Of The Chris Rock Show' is great!! Once again, Chris covers issues with a sharp wit, so many people could be offended, but he doesn't hold his tongue. The highlight of this DVD is 'Halle Berry 911', which is worth the price of the DVD itself. The low point is the 'Free Bobby Brown' & 'Confederate Flag' skits. Those skits were 'alrght', but nothing special. Overall, this is a cool DVD, and I really like the Halle Berry (& the Taxi Cab Confessions segment!!) skit. Check it out!!",998265600,3,510,4.4361702127659575

7938408,3,B00005J6UN,"People keep writing that these ""Best of..."" DVDs are incomplete and duplicate the same stuff on different DVDs.  This Vol. 2 kind of demonstrates that this is true, in my opinion.  We're being played (no pun intended), and if we want to have these skits to watch forever, we'll keep buying with high hopes we're not getting robbed.  Shame on Lorne Michaels, et al.  You surely have enough money by now that you can reward faithful SNL viewers with complete discs of new material on each separately-priced disc. Come on.",1167955200,2,519,4.733333333333333
7938409,2,B00005J6UN,"This is my 2nd review in seven years. I bought this because of the almost 5 star rating. I loved volume 1 and thought this would be even better. The only things really funny were the racist toys, Mike Tyson for president (10 seconds long?), what not to do when getting pulled over by a cop and the taxi cab confessions. The confessions are a 30 minute video extra; otherwise this DVD would have nothing on it. It's a long hour when you hardly laugh. And what happened to Wanda Sykes?? She was hilarious in the 1st volume. If I had to do this again I'd buy only volume 1.",1123027200,,570,4.1909090909090905
7938410,5,B00005J6UN,"If you think Chappelle's Show is funny and you haven't seen the Chris Rock Show, you are in for a treat. You telling me you haven't seen the ORIGINAL Pootie Tang interview? Hilarious. Chris Rock's comedy is some of the best. A lot of Chappelle's Show skits aren't as up to par as some of the stuff on here. Chris Rock is one of the greatest comedians alive. I love this show. I wish they would continue making more seasons of this show. I would also recommend the FDTV: Volume One DVD. It has a different style of comedy blends that Chris Rock and Chappelle's Show doesn't have. As far as this DVD goes, BUY SEASON 1 & SEASON 2 of the Chris Rock Show. This stuff is classic.",1116979200,,674,4.232558139534884
7938411,5,B00005J6UN,"The first Best-Of had some great skits, but having now seen volume 2, I know there's MUCH MORE out there that deserves to be released as well!

Chris Rock always knows how to make the best laughs out of any situation, and he does it well.  Spoofing society and all within and all that it makes, skits like ""Mike Tyson for President"", ""Progress Report"", the exceptional ""Halle Berry 911"", ""S**tstorm"" (okay I bleeped two letters but it really is gut-bustingly funny to watch!), ""Racist Toys"", ""UPN News"", ""Baby 1 Credit"", ""Make You Wait Hair Salon"", the never-stop-laughing ""Educational Video"", and basically all the rest will keep you in stitches!  In short, even without namedropping some of the skits, the only one that failed to amuse me entirely was ""The Next Great White Hope"".  But even then, that one still had its moments.

Audio and video quality are rather good for a contemporary TV show release.  Video is mostly crisp, though there is some artifacting that might not look good on HDTV.  But that's hardly worth complaining about.  No demerit marks for these issues.

I wish HBO would release this series because it's the funniest show I've seen in years.  Which is odd considering it's now 2005 and his show ended in 2000, but I digress.

One tiny disclaimer, there is some profanity involved (after all, this show was on cable, where free speech can generally be exercised unless you're a news network, but I digress...), but it's not overly done and often it's intelligently written in.  So even if those naughty words are normally a turn-off, at least Netflix it - either way, you WON'T be disappointed!",1109203200,,1619,4.805054151624549
7938412,2,B00005J6UN,"I had no idea he had a show, and one day I discovered this qand imidiatley bought it because Chris Rock has never disapointed me at all before. For me, his show is a giant letdown. The only times I can remmeber laughing at only the first and last sketches: the one with taking steps forward and backwards, and the 'How to not get your ass beat by the police' film. THose were funny. The rest wasn't even mildly funny.

I guess CHris is only good in some feilds. He's a good guest for a talk show, and his stand up video's are hillarious, but this one stunk. Some of the Taxi Cab Conversations was funny, but only some. If you are wondering what the rest of the dvd has in store, it's highly unoriginal sketches about the ""n"" word, and ""cracker"". It seems like him and Dave Chappell are constantly copying eachother.

Don't get me wrong, I loved bigger and blacker, and the one where he runs for president was pretty funny, but unless your a fan of the show, or the Chappell show, then I reccomend that you skip this one.",1108771200,,1020,4.27979274611399

7938415,5,B00005J6UN,"Being one of the top standup comics in the world, Chris Rock has proven that he is not another Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy when it comes to raunchy comedy. Unlike those latter comedians, Rock's appeal with urban and suburban America has made him a popular not only due to his previous work on Saturday Night Live, but due to his stint as host of his weekly cable television show, HBO's ""The Chris Rock Show.""
""The Best of the Chris Rock Show, Volume 2"" is another hysterical compilation of incredibly funny skits and jokes that Rock and other talented writers on his show have given television audiences in the past few years. Using fake recreations, commercial spoofs, and the talents of the ultra-funny Wanda Sykes, this collection will have you on the floor laughing.
Some of the funniest skits on this DVD include ""Selvina Delvina,"" featuring Wanda impersonating a possessive singer who only sings about her man and the ""Make You Wait Hair Salon"" where Wanda and Chris play the owners of a Harlem salon where waiting is a necessity and the service is slow.
Another funny sketch is ""Halle Berry 911"" where Rock does a William Shatner-type role as host of a reality-based show (spoof of the show ""Rescue 911""). The sketch which shows Berry as a menace to drivers was actually inspired by two automobile accidents she was involved in and ran away from the scene of the accident. I don't think the Oscar-winning actress will find this mockery of her driving skills amusing, but Rock sure does a hysterical job. The ""Baby 1 Credit"" and the comical driving safety sketch are also added bonuses on this DVD.
This DVD, which comes with bonus material of Rock's version of HBO's ""Taxicab Confessions"" is also great, although most of the material on this disc is the same as Volume 1. Overall, this DVD is one of the best comedy DVDs to come out in a long time. It's much more funnier than his ""Pootie Tang"" movie and worth every cent. Born with a gift for comedy, Rock is definitely one Saturday Night Live Alum who hasn't lost his touch. This DVD is a must have for anyone into outrageous, mouth dropping comedy sketches. Highly Recommended!",1019088000,15,2139,4.691489361702128
