7987471,1,B00008WI96,For starters Misty Mundae could not have saved this movie! It was doomed from the start. The hype i encountered prior to the purchase of the dud was the only thing that prompted me to pursue the purchase. The music did well to sidetrack the viewer on the slow motion of the dialog. I know American producers take great pride in hiding and faking the sex in their sex flicks but they could learn a lot from the European counterparts.,1243728000,,432,4.4125

7987473,5,B00008WI96,"This is one of my favorite b-horror erotic films. A good female cast, not great but I really appreciate that they are not full of implants.  The male cast is awful, but you dont' have to put up with them through much of the film. Don't overpay for this, but it's a good film to see.",1199750400,,282,4.035714285714286

7987475,1,B00008WI96,"My husband and I have never been into anything like this before and were interested in checking it out. We looked around and saw this. The cover was a little shady, and the description seemed a little interesting but once we watched it we were very disapointed. The acting was cheesy at best. It was like an adult Hocus Pocus with Bette Middler. They were trying to kill people to stay young like that movie where they suck the life out of children to stay young. Totally not worth the three bucks I spent on it. I'll keep looking for something of interest. Bad acting... just aweful. Save your money.",1173916800,3,601,4.472727272727273
7987476,5,B00008WI96,"This is a well-made erotic horror B-movie. If you are looking for award-winning acting, explosions, and elaborate sets, this movie isn't for you. That said, it is a super erotic movie with some very attractive girls, who look like your girl next-door, not like they came from a cosmetic surgery brochure. Director Marsiglia's movies usually present an original vision, not the cookie-cutter Playboy-movie variety. As the title suggests, the story involves a group of sexy lesbian witches running a beauty salon who seduce their pretty clients for ritualistic purposes. Invariably you'll have someone who finds out what they are up to and tries to destroy them. The eroticism is very atmospheric. The movie is not fast paced but creates a sexy aura. The girls look like they are actualing enjoying their work and each other. This movie together with G-String Vampire is some of the hottest stuff you'll find on DVD. Highly recommended if you like erotic girl-girl action.",1115164800,10,970,5.1069182389937104
7987477,1,B00008WI96,"what the heck does this have in common with carlito's angels. I told my boyfriend to buy me carlito's angels for Christmas and he got me this movie too, he said they came together. Who thought this was anything like that movie, Who thought this was anything like a comedy? who decides these things. ridiculous",1073520000,2,309,4.636363636363637
7987478,1,B00008WI96,The only reason I had bought this DVD was for the beautiful Misty Mundae...but to my surprise this flick does not star Misty Mundae. If you are a Misty fan I suggest Mummy Raider or even the Lust in the Mummy's Tomb just for the Vibrating Maid featurette (she looks great nude but even better in stockings),1066953600,,306,4.385964912280702
