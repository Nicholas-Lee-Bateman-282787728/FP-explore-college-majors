3676437,4,B001L1IDJ2,"While this is more of a genuine love store it is also a very good war movie.  I thought the love interest plot was well done and was an integral part of setting the stage for the incredible war scenes.  I visited the actual battlefield area last year.  It is remarkable to see when you are there just how compact the actual battlefield really was.  While the war scenes were very realistic I was not a big fan of ending which was a bit contrived, yet the writer needed some kind of story line so I will let it go at that.  The lead and supporting actors were excellent.  If you are looking for a 120 minute action packed war movie then watch When Trumpets Fade by HBO or the tremendous Black Hawk Down.  But if you are interested in a overall great WWI genre movie with a great love story interwoven with first rate battle scenes then definitely get Passchendaele.  Note that I actually bought my copy as no local video stores have in stock.  As as side note, in the city of Ypres, Belgium they have a ceremony to honor the WWI dead EVERY NIGHT of the year in the town square.  I wonder if we do that anywhere in the States?",1250985600,78,1124,4.210280373831775
3676438,3,B001L1IDJ2,"This is certainly a well-made film, with excellent acting and very realistic looking sets.  But if you want a vivid account of the true horrors of trench warfare in the Ypres Salient, this movie may not be for you.  It's actually more of a love story than war story - good for attracting a more female audience perhaps, but a bit ""lite"" on history.",1247011200,10,348,4.421875

3676440,5,B001L1IDJ2,A very powerfull drama set against one of the most violent campaigns of World war One . Anyone who sees this will have a newfound respect for those brave souls who fought in the war to end all wars.,1242604800,3,198,4.102564102564102
3676441,4,B001L1IDJ2,"I'm still waiting for someone to do a ""great"" WWI movie, and bought Passchendaele thinking this might finally be it.  In short, it's far better than most movies on WWI, but this still isn't the ""great"" movie that desperately needs to be done.

The combat scenes and authenticity in this movie are BY FAR the best done thus far on trench warfare.  Even more impressive, this film was written by and produced by, the main ""star"" or character in the movie.  This man did an outstanding job!  The story, or at least the opening scene, is based on the experiences of his grandfather in WWI.  The extra features are fantastic and you get a great idea of the pains they went through to get the look of Passchendaele correct.  As a fanatic on authenticity, the uniforms, weapons, and the battlefields are top-drawer - I didn't see any mistakes and that seriously impressed me.  The ""major"" battle scene at the end of the flick is superb, a bit campy right at the end, but over all, it's the best and most graphic WWI battle sequence yet filmed.

On the down side, as always, it seems film makers find it necessary to implant some type of love story into a movie which doesn't need one.  In this case, the main character falls in love with a nurse and therein lies the problem I had with the film.  The love story only serves to slow the movie down and adds a bit of unrealistic puffery which wasn't needed.  The love story comes off a little too much like something you'd expect to see in a 1940's era flick and because of this, you can pretty much figure out who's gonna' die and who's gonna' make it through.  This movie would've been much better if they had stuck to telling the story of the Canadian troops and their German opponents and left the soap opera out of it.

If it weren't for the love story, I would've easily given this movie 5 stars, but for that, I have to knock one off.  Still, I HIGHLY RECOMEND this movie to any fan of excellent war movies or those interested in WWI history.  This is an extremely well-done movie and it deserves a lot more credit and attention than it's getting.",1240272000,232,2095,4.402597402597403
3676442,5,B001L1IDJ2,"I love Paul Gross as a singer and as Benton Fraser in the TV show ""Due South"". I did not really know what to expect in terms of production values when it came to the movie ""Passchendaele"" but I must admit, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Not only does the movie look great, but the story is really interesting and the scenery is beautiful. Yes, it is a love story but it is also a war film and quite the unforgiving one, to boot. Get it, you won't regret it.",1481414400,2,464,4.1098901098901095

3676444,3,B001L1IDJ2,"Kudos to Paul Gross for his dedication and hard work in creating this film. The trench and battle scenes were authentic, gut-wrenching and the cinematography was superb. Even though a number of other reviewers questioned the love story (one going so far as to call it 'plastic'), I sat down to watch the film with an open mind. Unfortunately for me the romance completely overwhelmed the battle that gave the movie its name. I was hoping for something more powerful from a production titled ""Passchendaele."" Perhaps if I watch it a second time I'll find the film more enjoyable. If you're a WWI buff, but find a touch of romance makes a dreadful time in history more palatable, an alternative might be ""Birdsong.""",1476489600,,713,4.804878048780488

3676446,1,B001L1IDJ2,"The misleading trailers showed all of the battle sequences making it look like a war movie.  However, the movie is actually a poorly executed love story set in WWI.  The problem in this (aside from the misleading trailers) is how disproportionate the movie was in relation to ""love story"" and ""war movie"".  The first 6 mins and last 15 mins are great WWI battles but the rest of the 2 hr movie was a really bad love story filled with a whiny English brat and a drug addict nurse (whose addiction is only referenced once in the movie).  The actors are unlikeable and unbelievable (and not in the good way).  What could have been a great movie was destroyed by director Paul Gross.",1474588800,,679,4.487804878048781

I give Kudos to Gross for his attempt to capture the reality of his Grandfather's war.  Unfortunately the love story combined with the Christian symbolism leads to an overall failure for the film.

3676454,2,B001L1IDJ2,"I am a great fan of Paul Gross.  He was the general factotum and star of this flick.  Yes, the World War I sequence was excellent.... yes Paul chewed up the scenery ... but the writing falls below our general expectations in the contemporary cinema.  Basically very sentimental with obvious stock character choices - many of whom were stereotypes.  We've seen it before.  What was the thrust of this movie for the viewer?  I'm not sure.  Futility of War?  I think Paul side-stepped clarifying the Big Issues here and was unable to dig himself out of his own ""no man's land"".  I checked out GALLIPOLI (Mel Gibson) at the same time and one tries to avoid comparisons but in every way all aspects of GALLIPOLI and Gibson are superior.",1464048000,,731,4.604651162790698

3676488,5,B001L1IDJ2,"This is a very good movie about Canadians in WWI.  A soldier named Michael Dunne is wounded in battle and is sent home to Canada to recuperate. We met some of the standard pro War military men who think that anyone who does not want to die in battle is a coward. One of the young men, David Mann, suffers from Asthma and wants to join up against his sister's, Sarah Mann, wishes.  They have grown up in Canada, but their Father was a German, who died during the early part of the war fighting for Germany.  Michael is no  longer required to participate in the war because he suffers from Shell Shock in WWI, Battle Fatigue in WWII and now we call it Post Traumatic Stress.  He goes back because David Mann finds a way to join the Army, despite his Asthma. The Battle of Passchendaele is shown with as much accuracy as possible.  Paul Gross, who directs as well as plays Dunne, used WWI photos to recreate the battle field.  It has been 100 years since the start of WWI and I enjoyed this movie.  I learned more about how foolish the commanders were in using 19th Century battle tactics to fight a modern war with 20th century weapons.

Paul Gross is a relative unknown in the U.S. and that is a shame.  Loosely based on the experiences of his great-grandfather in WWI, Gross has written, produced, directed and starred in the unbelievable story that was Passchendaele.  I taught World History on both the high school and college level but this movie educates the viewer of the horrors of trench warfare better than years of study ever could.

Be aware, though, that the primary plot of this film is the relationship in Canada, not the war in Europe.  It also has major ethical themes.  I would say this is more a romance than a war film.  If you are looking for a thoughtful commentary on love and the human condition in a time of crisis, this is a gem.  If you are looking for a swaggering war film, this is not it.

All that said, the (too short, in my opinion) war scenes are spectacular.  I was particularly impressed with the portrayal of the battalion operations officer.  His character was a study in what it takes to run a battle.  Wow.",1396137600,,701,4.3307692307692305

3676515,2,B001L1IDJ2,"I understand the director, lead actor Paul Gross wrote this as a memorial to a family member. If this was the main drive, it is tragic because it does not engage reflection of a life lost. Others have hit out at the Mel Gibson type scene of the battle-field crucifixion and the awful last sequence. As a love story it is unrealistic. As a First World War story?-in the telling the Canadian experience it suffers the usual ""There was only us"" on the field of battle mentality and a glut of cinematographic violence. Moments which capture the hand to hand combat, the mud and gore but, if you read the history of Passchendaele, most of this film is way off the mark. For example, the black and white footage in the credits of the battle ground seemed at odds with the overly stated setting and delivery of this film. Not sure the point of it, neither history nor engaging story. Protagonist a John Wayne with Clint Eastwood voice. Superb photography but a nothing film.

3676516,5,B001L1IDJ2,"This is the tragic story of the fight for a little Belgian town in WWI.  I had never heard anything about Canadian involvement ""Over There,"" so it was certainly an eye-opener.

My grandfather fought in the trenches of France, and my great-grandmother's sister was a Red Cross field nurse there, too.  He came home without a scratch, but would never utter a single word about the experience for the rest of his life.  She came home with a Purple Heart, watched her true love die of his wounds, and never married after such an overwhelming loss.  I share this for those who might think ""Passchendaele's"" story line is contrived or convoluted; given my own family legends, it's pretty believable to me.  I am a Vietnam War era veteran myself, so the combat and hospital scenes were meaningful, disturbingly well-produced and heartbreaking for me to watch.  Most viewers probably won't have that problem, but I could never even get past the opening credits when trying to watch ""Saving Private Ryan.""

The story's vehicle is the love a wounded, shell-shocked soldier bears for the rehab center nurse who helped him recover in Calgary as the war continued to rage in Europe.  She has a few flaws, feels unworthy of a meaningful life, and does nothing to encourage his attention.  He discovers the nature of her flaws and is undeterred.  For love, through different routes, they both end up in Europe at the battle of Passchendaele.

The love story is a sweet one. Michael Dunne and Sarah Mann are beautifully and believably played by Paul Gross and Caroline Dhavernas.  Scenes of passion are tastefully filmed, and there is very little vulgar language.  Such sensitivity, I think, probably advances the story well.",1387584000,6,1709,4.888888888888889

Similar to the utter war movie/love story fail that was Pearl Harbor a few years ago, the producers felt that by somehow adding an excruciatingly long and drawn out love story they could attract a female audience.  As with every movie that attempts to water down an important historical event by making it centered on a love story, it totally fails.  There is about 15-20 minutes of WW1 battle scenes, but even this totally fails when they go for the haggard and in your face ""cross to bear"" imagery.

3676526,1,B001L1IDJ2,"An incredibly insipid movie with very few redeeming entertainment qualities and zero historical accuracy. The plot is worthy of a one hour hour soap opera episode from the 1980s, as this is primarily a romance story between Paul Gross and the surprisingly excellent Caroline Dhavernas. As such, the movie almost succeeds, but it's far too disjointed, and with too many missing plot points, to be followed. There's almost no chemistry between the actors though, and the romance is far from believable. As to the ""actor"" who plays the young, idealistic neophyte ... well, I'm afraid his performance was atrocious.
The pace of the movie is agonizingly slow, with minimal actual battle scenes. During those too-short periods when action does take, the scenes appear to further illustrate the incompetence of the young actor's character (""Quick, rescue the kid!"" only works so many times before you give up and hope he just gets shot).
As to the final battle scene: they even got the weather wrong, not to mention missing the entire point about Passchendaele: the horrific battlefield conditions and the complete purposelessness of a battle which consumed hundreds of thousands of young men men for no reason. Also, within the battle scenes, the only point the director seems to want to drive home is that the Germans were evil. Not just an opposing force, but truly evil individuals.

3676543,5,B001L1IDJ2,"At 20 million dollars, PASSCHENDAELE was the most expensive Canadian movie ever produced. And I think it's fair to say that every dollar of that budget shows on the screen. From the ultra-realistic battle scenes at Ypres and Passchendaele, to the portrayal of Calgary as a small prairie town at the turn of the 20th century, it is faithful to the visuals of what it must have been like to live at that time.
PASSCHENDAELE is a throwback to the kind of war movies made by John Wayne, albeit with a hero in the throes of neurasthenia (PTSD) for having needlessly killed a young German soldier in a particularly cruel fashion. It wavers between glorifying the soldiers who fight in war, while criticizing war itself, especially the old men who stay safe at the home front and shame young men into joining the army.

This movie is amazing in that it is a war epic quite literally made by one man, Paul Gross.  Gross, wrote, solicited funding, produced, directed, starred, and even wrote the song ""After the War"" for this movie.  I'm a fan of war movies, and it was this fact that led me to first watch PASSCHENDAELE.  I must say, that for a one-man war film, it is astounding.  I really enjoyed it.  Other reviewers have commented on anachronisms in the speech of the characters and a ""plastic love story"", and, to some extent, these are valid criticisms.  But I ask them, could they single-handedly make a better movie?

The love story is between the character played by Paul Gross, Sgt. Michael Dunne, and his nurse, Sarah Mann, played by the wonderful Caroline Dhavernas.  The cast is rounded out by wonderful Canadian character actors, many of whom will be recognizable to fans of The Murdoch Mysteries, dueSOUTH, Slings & Arrows, and others.

Michael and Sarah have a strangely unrequited love; hers being dependent on him keeping her brother safe in the war. I wanted the characters to have more of a love story while the movie spent time on the home front in Canada. In my opinion, it would have strengthened the power of the ending.

Yet, this is a very powerful piece.  I would caution families against showing it to young children, as the battle violence is quite realistic.  Sexual scenes are very tame and brief, with no skin showing and more left to the viewers' imagination than to the screen.  Quite wisely too, I think.  PASSCHENDAELE was given an ""R"" rating -- I believe because of the war violence.  I think it would be ok to show to teens with parental guidance, especially if they are studying WWI in school.  Like its spiritual predecessor, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, the violence is not gratuitous: it shows the utter brutality and sheer waste that war can be.  Nevertheless, the visuals are brutal and disturbing.  Something that parents would want to talk to their kids about.

PASSCHENDAELE highlights the tremendous contribution Canada made to WWI.  The sheer numbers of men killed were staggering. It glorifies the bravery of the individual soldier and of the platoons, while showing the futility of the war.  It has a place in the war movie collection of any fan of the genre.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passchendaele/dp/B0046YK4KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passchendaele</a>",1346630400,40,3247,4.941068139963168

3676556,3,B001L1IDJ2,"War has always been good fodder for film. After all, it takes the viewer to the extreme of circumstances and tests the characters' mettle. It helps define what is in people. What they're made of. This is more of a war/ anti-war film.

Here's the scoop. Paul Gross, as Sgt. Dunne, is wounded in action during WWI. He falls for a nurse and is sent back home to Calgary, Canada. He meets up again with her there. He's a bit touched in the head from the war. She's ""broken"" because of a dark secret regarding her father in the war. Her younger, asthmatic, brother, due to some official skullduggery, is recruited against medical protocol and is sent to the front lines. Gross feels he must get back there to protect the boy, his love interest, and somehow himself. This is a mere sketch but I don't wish to spoil.

User reviews are justifiably split. Paul Gross both wrote and directed this. I liked it more than not. There was a lot to like but there were also some serious missteps. The depiction of the battles, I thought, had a good look and feel to them. The climactic battle, in particular, is pretty incredible. Seeing guys fighting close up, hand to hand, is very immediate. It brings home how one needs to keep himself packed tight in those situations. The home scenes were more pedestrian. One reviewer mentioned how it reminded him of a Hallmark movie. I don't know if it was quite that hackneyed, but it wasn't far. Some of these scenes were just plain clumsy.

The performances, particularly Gross's, were uniformly good. It had a good look and a good musical score. A bit of punching up in the script and better handling of the quieter scenes would have added great measure to the whole film.

I liked this more than I didn't like it. Even at its two hour running time I wasn't bored. If you're into wartime dramas this is not at all a bad watch. A bit of spit and polish (and maybe some dry matches) will do just fine.",1318896000,4,1929,4.440677966101695
3676557,5,B001L1IDJ2,"The relatively low ratings this film has received are undeserved.  I'm a psychotherapist and social scientist, and I watch a lot of movies because so much that is central to human experience is coded in narrative form.  Narrative transports us where we might never otherwise go, and it has the power to do so when few other things do-- e.g., I watched an antisemitic person bawl uncontrollably while seeing Shindler's list (not that she didn't struggle to insure that her attitudes remained unchanged, but she was unquestionably affected).  From my point of view, many of the less accepting reviews seemed somewhat to miss the point.

We watch movies like our primitive ancestors used to sit around campfires listening to mythopoetic tales.  They seemed magical.  To achieve this, story tellers used symbols and personalized (interaction among character we can acre about and identify with)-- as well as plot progression.  We are drawn into a lot of ugliness we might otherwise avoid by having gotten caught up in the lives of the characters.  They're why the story matters to us.

The movie is about a massive war that involved almost the entire world and turned warfare into a whole new level of technocarnage (represented here by the impersonal artillery explosions constantly occurring and taking a huge number of victims).  What matters most is that we know that in the case of WW I, no aspect of the war  mattered one bit (as we are told by the writing that appears at the end (which says that the grown gained by the Canadians was gained right back in just 3 weeks by the Germans).  This is represented by the absence of anything visible worth winning pictured on the screen most of the time.  WW I was indeed a war over puddles, and it ended because everybody just got tired a needed to take a breath (the fighting would continue in Versailles, only to culminate in that other debacle, WW II).  Were it not for Hitler and what he represented, WW II would have represented little m ore than a replay of the poiuntlssness of WW I-- only with much more dangerous toys.  Just look at the famous Civil War documentary, and that war would have been almost similar had it not been for Lincoln, the end of slavery, and how the U.S. turned out-- because, in terms of the actual dying, it was as pointless, and as due to idiotic bravado.  Alas, WW I had no such issues:  IT WAS POINTLESS!!!

The movie, however, made a critical point here:  IT BECOMES MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT INVOLVES PEOPLE.  This was powerfully conveyed when the main character went after the nurse's little brother, and the previously anonymous bad-guys-to-be-slaughtered (as he had slaughtered the blond kid at the beginning) German soldiers suddenly rose up as human beings, and stopped shooting because they were able to appreciate the striving of one of their fellow human beings (even though he was on the other side).  In aviation history, WW I is known as the war that brought an end to such chivalry.  Moreover, the contrast between the warmth of small town life and the ugliness of the guys who scrawled on the walls of the nurse's house; the purity of the hero's love for the nurse (his masculinity so secure that they could reverse nursing roles with each other, as the elderly do if Alzheimer's hits the one who had always been the caregiver); and the scenes of the gorgeous home country landscape they left in order to undertake the muddiness of the battlefield.

This movie has to be seen more in terms of poetic art rather than straight representation-- which is why I harken to the wonderment of ancient peoples listening to the tales of Gilgamesh in Babylon, of of the Iliad in ancient Greece, the Gospels in early Christianity, the Old Testament stories among the ancient Hebrews, the Koranic verses among Bedouins in the desert, etc.  This is what happened to the history of art when Civilization first hit PBS TV stations in the 60s.  By taking the license it does, this film transports us to the TRUE WW I experience, and everything that leaves us disturbed and unsatisfied about the pointlessness of it all is only due to the fact that's that how it really was.  I highly recommend this film as a means to the soul of WW I, as an inkling into what the people of the time were trapped into, AS WE WILL BE IF WE REFUSE TO LISTEN TO WHAT OUR HEARTS TELL US AFTER SEEING SUCH MOVIES ABOUT UNDERTAKING SUCH POINTLESSLY NARCISSISTIC SELF-INDULGENCES FOR NO GOOD REASONS (do you read Iraq?).",1318118400,,4472,4.7012820512820515

3676559,2,B001L1IDJ2,"This movie had a lot of good things going for it.  It had an excellent cast.  It was set in one of the truly horrific bloodbaths of World War I.  And the budget they had for special effects makes the combat scenes and trench life fantastic.

But the plot is terrible...there's just too much going on.  We have the war weary sergeant, the callow young man with something to prove, the morphine addicted beautiful nurse, the craven superior officer.  And the movie just moves them through one cliche after another.  It's almost as though the filmmakers didn't trust that simply showing the Passchendaele bloodletting through the eyes of the Canadians who fought and died there was enough of a story.

I can't help but think that if they had been smart they would have greatly simplified this movie.

I'm not an expert on World War I themed movies but I can nominate four that are much better than this.

Even if not completely accurate it was certainly as accurate as Private Ryan, as the star, was the director and the grandson of the person he was playing.  This movie had nowhere near the resources a Steven Speilberg movie would.  Secondly, I don't think someone should be able to review a movie because the seller didn't send it.  I can't for the life of me understand how a seller reflects on the movie itself.  If anything this movie gave a much too horrible picture of war while including some beautiful images.

3676562,3,B001L1IDJ2,"This is nearly a good film and I was actually liking it at one point, but at every opportunity to be better, it decides stubbornly to be worse. The plot is that a sergeant gets blown up, gets a medal and gets to go home (Canada) to be nursed by a quite lovely Nurse played beautifully by Caroline Dhavernas. He falls in love, she gets outed as a German (her dad is `stained by the cloud of Germany'). In a pique of patriotic zeal and anti Bosh fervour - her asthmatic brother gets a rather horrid Doctor to forge his health forms and he flies off to Passchendaele. Our hero then follows to protect him.

Let me say up front this is not a war film per se. There are some battle scenes and as ever they have tried to emulate the efforts of `Saving Private Ryan' realism. It is a love story that uses WW 1 as a backdrop and does address some of the issues from around that time. As one of Canada's most expensive films to date, it wants to remind us that of the 600,000 Canadians that fought one in ten did not come home. There is a central theme around the `crucified soldier', an incident that was supposed to have happened after Ypres in 1915. To this day controversy still surrounds this alleged incident, but the movie turns it into a piece of contrived artifice, that turns the schmaltz up to levels where one would expect feedback.

This is also a nice advert for the Canadian Tourist Board, as the scenes in rural Alberta are truly stunning, but whether they add to the lot is very subjective.  There are some nice touches, the blackmailing of young men/boys to join up, the use of carrier pigeons, soldiers sleeping on floors as the beds were too soft after being in trenches etc.  All of that should be incidental and is, the plot is where this film falls down and the reason, as one other reviewer has said, is this is an ego trip for Paul Gross (lovable Mountie from `Due South'); he wrote, co-produced, directed, starred and even wrote the song at the end - sorry the incredibly sentimental song at the end.

As a one man effort it ain't bad but could have done with a guiding hand of objectivity - the biggest allegation is that there is nothing new here, it is not the worse war film ever but it is so far from being a good one. If you like a love story with a plot so contrived that belief will require complete suspension, then you have found your celluloid Nirvana. If on the other hand you think the memory of the men who fought from the Commonwealth, deserves a better memorial, then you would be better advised to seek out `Beneath Hill 60'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beneath-Hill-60/dp/B004SJVQ4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beneath Hill 60</a>.",1305072000,3,2705,4.569072164948453

3676565,1,B001L1IDJ2,"I rarely write reviews but was moved to do so by this movie. Or rather by the sad reaction I had.
I am one of the few North Americans privileged and moved by visits to the massed graveyards of NW France ; visiting Thiepval was a most cathartic experience. I have also read every book I can about the western front. Ever since being a schoolboy I have been in awe and haunted by our war dead. Their names are written all over memorials in my school wall and in countless towns and tiny villages. (I was raised not 20 miles from the home depot of the Lancashire fusiliers and 5 miles from the ""Accrington pals"").The Somme and Ypres and Vimy and Passchendaele were always synonymous with tragedy and suffering and sad duty.

Though I felt the producers wanted to convey this (tragedy and suffering) and more broadly educate, the film missed the mark. There are true war stories that are remarkable by their unlikely natures, yet surely this tale takes the gold-prize for implausible co-incidences? Even if, by some tweak of outrageous fortune, this is based on a true story, why couldn't they stick to a more typical yet equally poignant plot? I won't even go into the things that happen....Some of the combat scenes are believable in part, but the rest.......

Despite this movie, there is so much more to still to say about WW1 and Canada's outstanding contribution (besides the horror and misery and loss, the Newfoundlanders, and the success of the Canadian Army in finally teaching the Allies how to break the deadlock of trench warfare.) That these aspects are seemingly trivialized by the nature of the plot is very sad. We had ""All quiet etc"" from the German side (2movies), the French have ""Paths to Glory"" and ""Gallipoli"" from the Aussies. Now we have Passendaele for the Canadians: I would think that few could be happy with these comparisons, wether Canadians , movie critics or historians.

Which makes me ask : when will Britain break her code of sad silence about WW1? I always got the impression that the subject was almost too ""holy"" to attempt. Too tragic to ever convey in film. So far, we've had ""oh oh oh what a lovely war"" a cynical comedy. But probably a better reaction than this movie. All I can think of is ""Behind the lines"" a fine production of the Booker prize winning ""Regeneration"" by Pat Barker. This dealt more with  the humane treatment of ""shell shock"" and war protest, than a national memorial. Maybe ""My Boy Jack"" will do . ""Lest we forget"".",1300492800,11,2475,4.6438356164383565
3676566,5,B001L1IDJ2,"Another reviewer said it exactly as I would; this film written, directed and starring Paul Gross gets SO much right--the battle scenes in particular and just a small amount 'wrong'. Paul Gross is terrific here and is so compelling as the smart, tough, Canadian soldier who comes home on leave from the War. He is very far from his 'goofy', but likeable character he plays in Due South from his TV show. The depiction of the hand to hand combat scenes is every bit as good as seen in Saving Private Ryan. But when Paul's love interest shows up at the Field Hospital just behind the front lines where he's stationed, and they kiss while the bombs are landing around them, a lot of the credibility factor in the movie goes right out the window. The final scene played out like some modern version of the crucification of Christ, either works for you--or it doesn't. I was ok with it and I still give the movie 5 stars but it isn't the perfect WWI film. (The Blue Max still has that title).",1300320000,,986,4.423076923076923

3676568,5,B001L1IDJ2,"This movie is great, but there's little mention behind what is ""exactly"" behind the scenes of Passchendaele. It is a small Belgian town near the Ypres Salient in the Flanders area, where hundreds of thousands of British and Canadian soldiers met their fate from 1914-1918. Ypres was wrecked completely during the war and Passchendaele was blasted to oblivion by artillery and close fighting on both sides of the military armies that wrecked against each other there. Entire battalions ceased to exist in the fighting there, and this movie is dedicated to the soldiers of the Canadian army that fought and died there. Their casualties in that area are rated as well over 60,000 Canadian dead, and all from a country that had less than 10 million in the population.
In the movie, one particular Canadian sergeant, who is wounded and forever haunted by the gory scenes of war he had experienced, is sent to Calgary, Alberta, Canada for a recruiting assignment under a no-nonsense Major who goes by the rules. He is attracted to a Canadian nurse, who not only happened to lose her father in an earlier battle that he participated in, but the hidden secret that her father had fought for the wrong side, which is soon brought to the public and making her lose her job for the accusation that she is a foreign spy. The nurse's brother, who suffers from asthma, is in love with a girl and feels shamed that he is not doing his part for the war effort, and has his patriotism questioned by the girl's father. With the public shame of who his father fought for, he seeks to enlist in any way he can and somehow worms his way over to a trench in the front lines.
The sergeant then does what he can to get back to the war in order to protect the nurse's brother, just in time to participate in the bloody finale of the battles that rage around Passchendaele. The casualties there are unpredictable, and quite bloody, as a warning to those that think that this is just a romantic drama. The ending is quite surprising and very dramatic to great effect. I only watched the movie once, but what I saw was all I needed as a reason to order the movie myself. There are few WW1 movies like this one.

One thing is quite clear and that is Paul Gross seems very fond of himself and his abilities. The film is heavy-handed and slow. It alternates between battle scenes and scenes on the homefront. I never believed the far-fetched romance with the Canadian nurse nor her brother with asthma who manages to enlist and winds up being looked after by Gross's character of Sergeant Mann, ala Saving Private Ryan. Yes, the battle scenes are gruesome and well filmed. It is just that the rest of the film is not on a par with the action scenes. I much more enjoyed The Red Baron and Flyboys. Perhaps maybe if Paul Gross had not tried to dominate every possible part of this film the results might have been better. The actual events on which this film is based were very significant and the Canadian forces made a great sacrifice and contribution. It is just a pity that this was not more obvious than Mr. Gross trying to carry the film solely by himself. He should at least have left the writing of the screenplay to someone more capable and objective. Then he would have been left with only top-star billing, directing and executive producing.

I felt like I spent two hours watching a Hallmark Movie set in Canada that just happened to be during the WWI time period, only to watch 20 minutes of tepid combat footage.

The ""making-of"" documentary said this was going to be shown to Canadian school kids.  That's too bad.  The only thing they'll learn about combat is that it is muddy, bloody and one must keep his matches dry.  The latter was actually a good detail thrown into the film.  If the whole movie had been about trench life, then there would have been more such insights.

The main character and his love were trite and hackneyed.  A bitter, anti-hero falls deeply in love with Florence Nightengale, who happens to have a dark secret that makes her a black sheep.

The combat would have been well done if it wasn't so subservient to the greater love story.  I thought that the love story would end at the front lines, but inexplicably, and quite implausibly, it follows to the end.  The love making scene was laughable (bombs going off in the distance ala Linda Lovelace?).  Why do modern war films try and insert sexual content into the grimiest, dirtiest context (as in Rachel Weisz and ""Enemy at the Gates"")?  The prostitute scene in the original ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was more realistic.

3676577,4,B001L1IDJ2,"As an American fan of actor Paul Gross, I hmmed and hawed over buying this movie on BluRay. The price was what really held me back, so I tacked it onto my Christmas list and thought if someone gets it for me, great, if not, I'll wait for the price to drop. Well, I received the BluRay as an Xmas gift this year and I'm so glad I did. This is an excellent movie. I'm not a fan of wartime movies at all (hated Pearl Harbor and couldn't stomach Saving Private Ryan) and also not into the gore. Though a very violent movie, I thought Passchendaele was tastefully done. It portrays the horrors of WWI without overusing graphic violence. The trench scenes are amazing and really make you think about how horrible it must have been. About half the movie takes place elsewhere, which gives it a nice pace. It starts on the battlefield and ends on the battlefield, but in between we get to see the lead character go home, and see how home is dealing with the war.

American viewers will probably feel a change in style. This is a Canadian-made movie about a Canadian story and it just feels a bit different from American movies. I feel that this is a plus. Paul Gross, who plays the lead, wrote and directed the movie. Parts of it are based on stories he heard from his Grandfather, who fought at Passchendaele, and you can feel how personal a story this is to him. He really puts his heart and soul into it and that comes through on screen. The love story is a bit hokey but enjoyable. The end a bit predictable but still heart-rending. Fans of Paul Gross, fans of war movies, and fans of just plain well-made and entertaining movies should enjoy this.

Paul Gross is, in my opinion, a stage writer. His plots can be too over the top for film. This story is certainly touching and beautiful, but the end is, unfortunately, a cheese fest. Gross does much better with humor (see Men With Brooms).
Also, Paul Gross is just too old to be the star. I mean, he's aged like a fine wine, but the character is supposed to be, what, 20? Paul Gross is a *great* actor but it's a bit of a stretch.

A film can't portray to ""never-served's"" what it FEELS like in combat. For those of us who have been there, though, - in any war - we vividly relive the smells, the shock waves, and the multitude of long-accumulated discomforts (headaches, hunger, bruises, rashes, cuts, sprains, infections - and the unique dumbing effect of months of sleep-deprivation), and the constant, long-term exposure to weather that we had no choice but to experience to the full, the often disturbing sights that we've seen, and the emotional numbing that some of us would fight (others not, succumbing to it, forever thereafter emotionally dead).  Exhaustion was the primary, overwhelming feeling, what the French call ""ennui"".  All of this simply accumulated the longer you were in combat. And on top of all of this, there was the obvious need for continual hyper-awareness of surroundings. The only positive thing that I recall is that we each were accepting of other co-unfortunates as complete equals, and would share unhesitatingly. The surreal life of a combat soldier at the ""point of contact"" is incredibly, definitively uncomfortable, stressful, and at times bewildering. The filth just has to be experienced.  You come to believe that you can never become clean again, and come to suspect that memories of past cleanness were false.  Exhaustion simply mounts.  We were gradually expended.  Reactions become purely reflexive, w/o thought.

And all of the above describes your state prior to wounding.  Once wounded, you experience the predictable waves of pain that thoroughly distract you from your surroundings; you KNOW just when the next wave will begin to roll through you, and you tense for it, and those muscles finally exhaust themselves: during a pain-wave, it is the only reality. This experience is completely surreal.  I remember being dazed and mentally drifting as an Army nurse swabbed clean a patch of skin on my forearm to insert an IV to rehydrate me and apply the morphine (morphine really works, by the way: all pain temporarily vanishes!).  Medical orderlies: ""Prepare to lift!""  ""Lift!"" ""Prepare to move!"" ""Move!""  To be lifted and carried strapped onto a taut stretcher is a bewildering, disorienting experience.  ""Prepare to rack!""  ""Rack!""  The stretcher is locked into a sturdy, aluminum frame, w/ many others.  You can now turn your head to one side or the other, only that.  ""Where are you from?  How were you wounded?""  You take stock of newly-found buddies (rank insignia cannot be seen; it is ""bad form"" for wounded to acknowledge rank), and try to let the reality of your disabilities sink in.  Are you permanently crippled?  You feel helpless, vulnerable, desperate, because your weapons have been taken, and these have not been out of your hands in months, prized possessions.  Triaged numerous times at different stops, you are medevac'ed progressively ""back"", handed off from the ""A Team"" to the ""B Team"" as you are gradually de-prioritized.  You doze.  Only your head is loose, and it rolls side to side as the aircraft rocks in flight.

Those who come to accept this existence as ""their new normal"" will never readjust to peacetime. Call it ""PTSD"", but it is really the normal and healthy acceptance of conditions that had to be endured. The truth, for good or ill, is that none of us are the same afterward - and our families (particularly) and acquaintances can't help but notice this. We all lapse into the ""thousand-yard stare"" frequently, even years after our wars - and thus we recognize one another, veterans of whichever war.

Immediately after being medevac'ed out of combat, I spent several months billeted among other wounded in what was called a ""Warrior Transition Battalion"" (WTB), and we were called ""wounded warriors"" by the excellent, caring Army nursing staff.  While there, waiting in queue for my surgery, I believe that I saw the full scope of wounds and also PTSD.  We received good billets.  We were clean (!), and were served fine chow.  More importantly, we had time to talk to one another, at length, in the Day Room.  I still remember many of those impromptu conversations.  Rank was forgotten.  We solicited the other's stories.  We commiserated.  We shared a mound of well-thumbed novels - and we discussed them!  We were patient w/ one another, always waiting for a long pause before speaking in conversation, never interrupting another.  Those more mobile got coffee for those less so.  I remember that some of us played chess, and took the time to concentrate on our moves (we had nothing, if not time!).  Others gathered to watch, all quite patient.  None complained or urged faster play.  I remember one languorous day, late morning to dusk, spent in a group that continually varied w/ comings and goings, discussing all aspects of coffee: experiences w/ it, different preparations of it, and its relative importance to a man. Eventually, we discussed our future prospects, in many cases altered due to new handicaps (I could no longer walk w/o a cane).  We each wanted quiet, calmness, dignity.  Ah, to be clean, untroubled, and to sleep between clean, white sheets, under good, thick, wool Army blankets!  I recall it wistfully now as a ""golden time"" interlude after a filthy, degrading, bruising experience.

This film did well: it presented the 1916-17 face of this experience.  I wish that young boys should see this side of things before they ""come of age"": the degrading misery and filth, rather than false film heroics and glamor .... only the comradeship was positive.  I will never be the same again - but I am better for the experience, a more generous person, capable of empathy.

It also suggested the nagging guilt that we wounded felt, leaving our buddies back in the fight.  This is a very, very important topic.  We all felt it.  It isn't depicted frequently enough, writers neglect it because they didn't experience it themselves and can't get into the minds of those of us who did.",1482451200,15,6237,4.981624758220503
