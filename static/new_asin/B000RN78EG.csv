8201499,4,B000RN78EG,"I wanted to complete my set of Kingdom Hospital DVDs and this allowed me to do so. I enjoy the series a lot, though it's not everyone's cup of tea. The story itself can be a bit confusing and slow to follow, mostly attempting to build suspense. I noticed at quite a few scenes that I became bored with the plot so I'm sure they could have shortened it to only 3 discs to keep the intensity high. Even though, I still highly enjoy the story about this crazy hospital and all of it's staff enough to watch it more than a few times. I would recommend to any Stephen King fan or horror fan.",1385337600,,586,4.104347826086957
