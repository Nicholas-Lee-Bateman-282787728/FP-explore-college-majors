8172959,3,B000MV90EY,"S.O.S TITANIC is the 1979 version of the classic Tragic event that happended way back in 1912
obviously not as Big budgetted as Jim cameron's version but still worth watching
has an all star cast like David warner, susan st James, Ian Holm and many others
The 2002 Image entertainment dvd is now out of print which had the film in 1:78:1 ratio at 103min
the U.K. Studio canal dvd is also out of print now
so the only official dvd version still available to buy is the Chinese dvd version by Castaway pictures
which i recently bought and is Definitely worth buying for sure
the DVD is NTSC ALL REGIONS but the screen ratio is wider at 2:35:1 runtime is 109min
being the Chinese DVD version there is both Chinese & English subtitles which can be turned off by your dvd remote anyway
so the film still has English Dialogue even without there subtitles, there are no EXTRAS either
the picture quality is very Good just for Digital remaster transfer
there is 144min (2hrs30mins) TV version aswell which was aired on U.S. TV back in the early 80's
tragically this Longer version has never been officially released and might never be,
there are bootlegged Dvd versions of the Longer cut but only in VHS quality 1:33:1 ratio only but very hard to find
so this Chinese dvd release is better than no dvd release of SOS TITANIC
worth buying for sure if you love the 1979 version i give about 3 stars for this dvd based on very Good picture quality",1488067200,4,1436,4.484732824427481
8172960,3,B000MV90EY,"I was really excited to watch this movie, but was disappointed that some of the scenes were cut from the original movie. I'm not sure why some of them were cut.",1465516800,3,160,4.193548387096774
8172961,2,B000MV90EY,"The European editors of this fine 1980 TV production eliminated much of the original 150 minute drama which made the fate of the Titanic a real cliff-hanger.  Missing in this DVD rendering are all the good radio room scenes (including the Marconi sparkgap transmitter sending ""SOS CQD"" in the TV production's opening titles) as well as the question of the nearby Californian's failing to identify the Titanic's rockets, and its tragic absence of a radio operator who went off watch at midnight fifteen minutes before the Titanic's first SOS went out.  Unlike ""A Night to Remember"" (which remains the most accurate and compelling version of the tragedy), this Titanic story (much like James Cameron's slosher) focuses on the horror of people of all classes going to watery dooms.  Of the eight Titanic versions I've seen, including the 1943 Nazi Germany one, S.O.S. Titanic ranks, along with its namesake, on the very bottom.",1284768000,14,924,5.065789473684211
