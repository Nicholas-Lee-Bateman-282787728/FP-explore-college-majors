3444752,2,B0019ZS0GG,"If you are a ten year old kid you might find this movie believable, on the other hand if you have been in the military or are a world war two history nut you will find this movie full of BS.IE us army soldiers using a Nazi sniper rifle as if it was issued to him. bombers flying so low on bomb runs they would get hit by blasts from their own bombs. Russian tanks painted up as Nazi tanks. American soldiers that don't speak any German dressing as Germans and traveling on German rail system etc. this could have been a great movie if the director wasn't your typical Hollywood girlie man. it is also as slow as molasses in winter.",1361836800,14,631,4.180327868852459
3444753,3,B0019ZS0GG,"""You have to carry out this mission your country is counting on you."" Toward the end of WWII the Americans thought the war was over and started to relax. When a group is sent out to deliver food to the needy they are ambushed and discover a horrifying secret. Hitler has a super bomb and isn't afraid to use it. When they hear the scientist in charge of the bomb is looking to defect the squad risks everything and ventures deeper behind enemy lines to find him and get him out. I will start by saying that the movie isn't that bad but it is a low budget war movie. Action is not bad and it is entertaining and an interesting story but it almost had the feel of a PBS type war movie in terms of feel and look. It's not quite as good as the recent batch of war movies that have come out but it's also not terrible and fans of this genre will not be totally disappointed. Overall, not bad but nothing amazing either. I give it a C+.",1361059200,10,930,4.087431693989071
3444754,5,B0019ZS0GG,"My son was in the 3 Marines and in Iraq when I ordered this DVD. I spent 14 months in Vietnam but I wanted to see what my son was up against.  This is a very different war.  I watched the entire DVD with a lump in my throat as I saw the bravery of these young men and the price they paid to take Fallujah.  The embedded reporter did an excellent job and this DVD is about as real as it is going to get with out being there.  I cannot say that this will change anyone's mind about the war but I can promise that it will increase your understanding of the war and the men fighting it. I am so proud of my son. He did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, but I could not watch this DVD again until he was out of the Marines.  I wish every American could see this one.",1296777600,3,769,3.78125

I swear the Americans shot down 500 Germans to a loss of only around 10 Americans in the movie.  Had the Germans been anywhere near this bad, they would have never even won a single campaign.

The movie is so-so but what's irritating is being advertised as multi-format including the ultra violet copy. The ultra violet code expired last December and had I known it's likely I would not have purchased it.  This is not the first time this has happened either so it should be a requirement to disclose the expiration date of all ultra violet copies.

WWII and Nazi Hitler movies like Eagle has Landed, Night of Generals, Fatherland, Schindler's List, Where Eagles Dare etc..and classic film
noir mystery and horror sci films so it's hard to find movies made in last 20 years that are worth watching but this is one of them. It starts off
with a bang with some great shot action scenes the story develops into a good plot that most movies don't have any more it's all CGI and
blood and gore with pretty boy and girl 'actors' who can't act. This movie is for those who like real action movies especially with good acting
and a good story plot. While it's not great or a classic but like the great western Appaloosa which everyone should see this is not a bad movie.",1476316800,,852,4.233128834355829

3444797,1,B0019ZS0GG,"so the fact that this film is based on a video game is no big surprise, as fans of that medium are precisely the audience this relentlessly implausible juvenile video shooting gallery is aimed at.

More laughable still is the makers' claim of its being based on an actual event.  A contention that is on its face inarguable, since World War Two did in fact happen.  But any claim beyond that would be a pretty tough sell to any sentient being at the most modest level of discernment, and that would include your average village idiot.

I'll wrap it up by saying that followers of the Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" series who were still big fans after its fourth installment will certainly love this flick just as much.",1449705600,2,717,4.578125

3444801,4,B0019ZS0GG,Strong WW2 action movie. A packed thrill ride with good dialogue and plenty of bullets and blasts. A small group of soldiers ordered to complete what seems like an easy mission but things turn ugly when they are ambushed by Nazis. The team fights for their survival while gaining some new friends along the way while finding themselves neck deep in a new yet almost impossible mission in a effort to stop Hitler's last stand as the Nazis make one final attempt to dominate the world.  If I could give it a 4.5 I would but since I can't I give it a very strong 4.0. Highly recommended for people who like patriotic war movies and nonstop action.  Well worth the purchase.

American soldiers are frequently getting killed yet unit integrity remains intact.
The Nazi's are of course dumb by movie standards and nearly every German soldier is a haplessly bad shot.

First off, the company's soon to be sniper (first scene of the movie, their in the snow getting blasted by a German sniper) and lead character takes aim at this other enemy sniper & kills him from a 100yards away. OK, the lead character takes aim with one eye closed, when the military has been teaching to fire with both eyes open for a really longtime (this is just one of hundreds of mistakes this movie makes in trying to portray the gristle'd band of WWII brothers & ""how to be a hero,"" er ""how to act like a hero""....) Lastly (and oh my gad how I could go on here) the acting is absolutely awful ... T. Sizemore needed a paycheck to keep himself out of the slammer and to keep gettin' high (cause his acting sucks to)... why didn't you stop at Saving Private Ryan in terms of your exploring a military character, hmm Tom? And seriously, he looked so bad & out of shape, do you really think the military would allow someone looking like that to be on some hot-shot special ops team? Weren't they Rangers? Good gad man, Ive never served, but even though I havn't; this movie is still a slap in the face to all military branches of the US armed forces! I mean really, someone actually gave this group of people like millions and millions of dollars to make a movie that this legal-studies major could have easily topped (and probably most people who have either watched the movie, or read this review).

It actually started out with some promise, but then devolved into an overwhelming CGI influenced unbelievable movie.  A group of GIs actually taking a train to Stuttgart?  Seriously?  Not being intercepted well before that point?  Never running out of ammunition?  Then just fitting in the opera house with ease?  And knowing exactly how to contact the underground contact?  And breaking into an atomic bomb installation?  Seriously? Not to mention the horrifically bad bombing scene at the end.  There are too many bad points to recount here, so I would even suggest you watch it just to see how bad this movie is.  I wish I could give it zero stars.",1423440000,2,742,4.7637795275590555
3444824,2,B0019ZS0GG,"I really like a good war movie.  I didn't like this one.  That's because it's not good.  It's not even merely okay.  It's trash.  Don't get me wrong: my judgement doesn't have much to do with the fanciful plot (""Hey, guys!  We've stumbled onto a Nazi super-bomb test site!!)  I've got a pretty well-developed suspension of disbelief, if other things--dialogue, action--hold up, I'm there.  Nope, not this time.

The tip-off was the name of the director, Don Michael Paul.  Who??  A little after-the-fact research reveals Paul's the director of a clutch of grade B horror movies and a Steven Seagal action flick. (Uh-oh.) Which means Company represents either his ""big break"" or ""just another clunker""  After about half an hour, the verdict is in: klunk, klunk, klunk. Hey, Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) is here.  Great.  Neal McDonough from Justified and Band of Brothers.  That's good, too.  Tom ""Saving Private Ryan"" Sizemore. Now, I know Sizemore's had some tough times recently, but I figured, what the hey, he's good.  But I was misled. Turns out all of them were slumming and had to know it. And now you do, too.

Sez Don Paul in the Special Feature about Recreating WW II, ""You don't realize how many people out there are World War II fanatics!""  Yeah, Don, I would. But you don't have to be to punch the eject button on this one. It pains me when I hear 1944-era characters saying ""boots on the ground,"" and ""kick some Nazi Ass."" Then, a Brit introduces himself as a pilot from the ""British Air Force."" No officer in the ROYAL Air Force would introduce himself that way!  I mean, I know it's tough to recreate Tiger tanks, but script changes are quick and easy.

The kill rate--and the manner in which the bad ol' Nazis die, and most yanks don't--reminds me of the silliness of the old 60s TV series Combat.  Which makes this movie a throwback, as well as a throw-away.  Save yer time and money.",1422403200,2,1900,4.622754491017964
3444825,1,B0019ZS0GG,"To call this junk would be a compliment.

Before you watch this movie (and I'd avoid it):  Have a few drinks.  Forget everything you know about WWII history, or hoped to ever learn.  Forget about every great movie you've ever seen and put all of your expectations aside.  Meditate, maybe do some yoga; get your mind and soul in a good  and neutral place.  Then, if you still want to see it, do your best to see how far you an go with it.  I'd set a timer, just for kicks.  If you're bored, snowed in, have no where to go and nothing else to do, if you're tolerant and could care less what is playing on your TV, then this is barely OK.  If your standards are higher than that, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

This trash is attempting to be a serious war/action/adventure movie, but everything about it is so ridiculous and stoo-pud, the only reasonable way to approach it is with loathing, disrespect.  And amazement that it could ever get made in the first place.  This is one of the worst movies I would have ever seen....as a kid...on the 11 o'clock movie...after they'd used up all the old 50's sci-fi stuff...back in the 60's.

As a WWII movie, this would make a great infomercial for the video game.  The only accurate things about it are, yes, WWII did happen and our guys wore green.  And they carried guns.  Beyond that, it's a total disgrace; especially since it's nothing more than an exploitation.  No art, no honor, no history, no respect, no talent, NO HEROES here.  ""Let's just make some money.""  The only thing this POS (and that's a stretch) accomplishes is to completely desecrate real heroes and their courageous sacrifices.  It shows total disrespect and ambivalence toward one of the most (if not the most) tragic and epic struggles ever to face people on this earth.",1422316800,2,1797,4.5186335403726705

Knowing its a video game softened the blow, but it really is a cheaply made amateur movie with B list actors. Its the battle of the bulge and a team of soldiers are on a mission that will take them deep into Nazi territory to get something very important, that may tilt the outcome of the war.

3444834,1,B0019ZS0GG,"I'm a fan of military movies in general, and WW2 films in particular. I regretted the time wasted watching this movie. This was a horribly strung together bunch of cliches and pointless action sequences. Even in the genre of films based on video games, this doesn't rate highly.
All of the usual 80s action film rules for weapons apply - the heroes' magazines never need to be reloaded, they can blast away on full auto and hit all targets, every hero can pick up any weapon from a fallen enemy and operate it, no weapons ever jam, enemies hit with bullets fly back with blood spurting...
The usual cliches of film Nazis also apply - down to the evil villain with a monocle, who speaks perfect English with a ridiculous accent. The German spoken in the film is hilarious - any fluent speaker can't help but laugh at the atrocious accents.",1417996800,3,838,4.556291390728477

The way the direction used every thing that he could in this movie, including; gore, facts, and portraying actually people. The thing that stood out most to me is how much courage all of the soldiers had and the bravery that was shown through out the movie. Another one of the things that I liked is that the characters didn't let a person dying affect them in a way that could stop them from fighting.

3444853,1,B0019ZS0GG,"There is so much wrong with the technical details of this movie it beggars description. For starters, no enlisted man in the U.S. Army ever calls an NCO ""sir"". Likewise, the platoon leader, who supposedly fought under the hero's father in WWI, is both too young and too old for the role of a second lieutenant (worse yet, the ""nugget"" bar on his right collar is placed horizontally, not vertically, a gaffe that anyone who knows anything at all about the military would never have allowed. The details get worse from there; the idea that another platoon leader--a West Point man, we're to believe, a career military man--would be ""busted down to cook"" for the mistaken call for supporting artillery fire is also a fantasy. The plot, likewise, is a joke, a bad joke, considering the ease with which this plucky band of supposed infantry men infiltrate into Stuttgart without being detected, even to the opera house (!) is the stuff of bad comic books. And the notion that a member of the Royal Air Force would say he is a member of the ""British"" Air Force, and would wear a beret--the mark of Army and marines in WWII in Britain--is painful, as is his absurd character; he wears RAF officer's wings but acts like a back-room Cockney brawler. And on and on, including the pop-gun sound effects of the Thompson sub-machine gun, which, when fired, tends to jack upward because of the violence of its recoil. In this asinine fantasy, this utter waste of money and talent, of CGI, the foolishness never stops, even unto the end, when a B-17 bomb group is escorted to the target at very low altitude by a covey of Mustangs, among them a section which the British actor can speak to using a walkie-talkie--impossible in WWIIand the flyboy talk is stupid, too, using modern alphanumerics, such as ""alpha"" for ""A"", when in WWII, the usage was ""Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy"" and so forth. If this represents the kind of B-movies we are facing as low-grade intellects try to replicate the success of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which had its own problems of authenticity, though most of the details were better attended-to) in the coming years, young movie-goers will be subjected to ever less accurate portrayals of World War II.",1405555200,4,2216,4.743523316062176
3444854,1,B0019ZS0GG,"Terrible movie. Never played the game, but the movie sucks. Little budget forced them to cheaply do CGI on the weapon muzzle flashes because they couldn't afford the proper blanks. CGI used in this movie was horrible.

3444855,3,B0019ZS0GG,"This thing screams low budget. It features lots of exploding blood fests as bullets hit bodies, resulting in blood spraying in all kinds of unlikely slow-mo directions. I guess it's loosely based on a video game. The Nazis are all very cartoonish, as is the rogue Russian soldier who tries to hijack the German atomic bomb for Russia. They never seem to run out of machine gun bullets, but no one ever reloads. This is more of a comedy than anything. Druggie actor Tom Sizemore reappears here after a long hiatus. A non-thinking movie if you're in the mood for mindless blood and guts.",1404604800,2,585,4.634615384615385

3444857,1,B0019ZS0GG,"I got 15 minutes into it and started reading reviews and am not sure I can finish it.  The first indication was soldiers calling a Sergeant ""Sir"" which would never happen in the military (this coming from a retired military guy who was once a Sergeant and officer).  The other thing that struck me right off the bat -- Germans are readying for a surprise attack on 17 Dec 1944 and an American squad is on it's way to an outpost the day before ... and the Germans are going to give up the element of surprise by attacking two trucks.  I don't think so.  My father served in the Battle of the Bulge ... I hate to see the battle belittled by a movie like this.  BTW, a handful of 15 soldiers showed as the main element would be a squad-plus ... not a company.  So the title is a bit misleading.",1404432000,3,791,4.137254901960785
3444858,1,B0019ZS0GG,"I know this is a LOW budget film that went straight to video so my expectations were not high going into this movie. Turns out I was giving the movie far too much credit. This has got to be one of the dumbest, silliest, poorly acted movies I have ever seen. It really is one of those movies where it is SO BAD it is funny (and obviously not intending to be). The story was ludicrous. Just some of the absurdities, I love how they always seem to be walking/running around in one large pack, both the Americans and Germans, etc. guess they felt the need for every actor to always be in the shot. When GI's are walking behind enemy lines at night it's always proper to scream out other soldiers names to get their attention or better yet, not to be the least bit concerned about chain smoking cigarettes. Guess the Germans all suffered night blindness and can't see the glowing cigarettes. And then there are the Germans, who needs guards when you're transporting a train full of prisoners, they won't escape the door locks will hold'em!!!!! Or the German Commander, knowing the Americans they are chasing are hiding on the train, just poo pooing it by saying, oh we'll get them when they get to Stuttgart (300 miles away). What, they can't stop the train? Too freaking funny!!! Or better yet, one American with a Tommy Gun never misses hitting every Germans when shooting at them (of course Germans make sure they all run directly into the line of fire so they can be mowed down like the cannon fodder they are) but when you have dozens of Germans shooting back at they can't hit a broadside of a barn (or train for that matter).  For comedy it's good the Germans drive around in trucks with gigantic swastikas on the doors, just to remind us that they are bad. Or better still, a brand new replacement can pick up a sniper rifle, shoot a German sniper and suddenly everyone thinks he is hot stuff. Then when the Squad Sergeant is mortally wounded he decides that the hot stuff replacement private is the only person qualified to take his place and run the squad and not one other soldier bats an eye. And the funniest moments, all an American soldier has to do is put on a German Uniform (no matter how dirty and ill fitting) and every German they come across is totally convinced they are fellow German soldiers without ever muttering a single word in German (and better yet, have conversations in English as Germans walk past them remaining totally oblivious). Quality, simply quality!!! Now the actors, Tom Sizemore looks like he has spent the last 5 years or so at Golden Corral eating everything in sight. Jrgen Prochnow one of my favorites, he must be broke and needs money, why on earth would he ever do a film like this.  I could go on and on with other ridiculous parts of this movie (including the detonated nuclear bomb, oh brother!!!) but I'd then end up writing a novel.

You don't need a big budget to make a good movie, just a good script, competent Director and decent actors. This awful movie has none of that.",1402876800,9,3026,4.498181818181818

It starts out great with the beginnings of the Battle Of The Bulge and has some great battle skirmish scenes of the German Army advancing on the American positions and I was impressed with some excellent fighting cinematics. Unfortunately once the storyline further unfolds and these soldiers' self-driven mission starts to develop, it just starts getting more and more unrealistic, bogged down, and confusing. The story continually falls apart and by the ending I'm saying to myself ""what did these guys even do?""

I wanted to rent this movie for the usual 24-48 hours but for some unknown reason the only way Amazon Prime would let me watch the movie was to purchase it. I'm sorry I purchased it.

3444870,2,B0019ZS0GG,"Rarely in the history of war movies has so much effort been put into such a poor production (well, maybe The Pacific had a worse ratio of money spent to result). Although I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, the premise of the Nazis having developed an atomic bomb in 1944 COULD have worked, that is if the screen writers, actors, and directors had made a serious effort. The screenplay works like it was written by high school students, jumping from one improbable occurrence to the next one. The acting is wooden (dare I say high school quality?) except for Sizemore (he may have a drug problem but the guy can act in his sleep) and Prochnow (who seems to be mailing it in but can still get it done). When German is spoken it is often butchered (couldn't anyone consult Prochnow?) and while a vast array of accurate American and German Army equipment was used, the Americans are armed with British Enfields while the Germans have post war Mausers. With this I assume it was made overseas and it was too much trouble to come up with some Garands. This movie is what happens when a bunch of war movie wanna-be makers raise a bunch of cash and then use a video game as their primary resource. What a waste, it could have been a modern day Dirty Dozen.",1394323200,2,1254,4.432900432900433

3444872,1,B0019ZS0GG,"I was drawn in by the somewhat promising beginning of Company of Heroes (and the revelation that the great Jurgen Prochnow is in it) and regrettably decided to continue watching. Once I'm committed to a film, I see it through to the end- another mistake on my part. Company of Heroes steadily becomes more and more unbelievable as it progresses, culminating in an absurd finale, and Prochnow is only on-screen for about 4 minutes in total, though this is probably for the best given how disappointing the rest of Company of Heroes is.

Company of Heroes tries unsuccessfully many times to create drama and evoke emotion in its viewers. It fails entirely. We are only introduced to a handful of characters, meaning everyone else is fodder for the Germans. Some of these dogfaces even make it about a third of the way through the film before falling victim to submachine gun fire, but do we care? Not at all. Forget about names, we don't even know what they look like! When the characters we do know start to get emotional over these fallen comrades, we don't buy it for a second. Thankfully, the half-assed mourning is minimal. Instead, we're subjected to boring stories about how Ransom (Tom Sizemore) lost his whole platoon earlier in the war. Yawn.

Many of the weapons used in Company of Heroes are historically inaccurate, and the German tanks look like a cross between the T-34 and the Panzer III. The CGI is also incredibly weak. B-17s are depicted as conducting bombing raids at about, oh, 300 feet above their targets; the explosions are super fake. Perhaps worst of all is the inclusion of modern slang terms (""catch you on the flip side"") in these ""heroes'"" vocabulary. In case you haven't guessed, the good guys are also able to kill dozens of Germans while sprinting and shooting from the hip, and the Germans, despite massing their superior firepower numerous times, are unable to do any damage to anyone. Oh, and did I mention the Germans have an A-bomb?

Beyond the historical inaccuracies (which are so blatant and thoughtless that this film hardly merits viewing), and as I have touched on already, the plot and the action are total cheese. Every character behaves typically, and Company of Heroes is so riddled with clichs in the first 30 minutes that it's no surprise when a token tough-guy Russian and a bloodthirsty Brit show up to help out a bit later. Three guesses whether or not the Soviet is actually a good guy.

Company of Heroes is mindless action with no sense of direction or purpose. The acting is average, the plot sucks, and the Germans have an atomic weapon. There is plenty of gunfire to go around, and there's a little bit of blood for you gore fanatics. The filmmakers even found an excuse to slip some female nudity on-screen, but it isn't much, so don't get too excited. None of it is enough to save the film, though. Watching Company of Heroes was like microwaving my brain. I advise against it.",1388448000,3,2936,4.706225680933852

This movie is also filled with numerous fire-fights and the special effects aren't half bad either, some of the geographical shots alone are beautiful.  Because the movie was made as a tribute to the game, war movie buffs shouldn't be holding this movie to the same standard of something like 'We Were Soldiers,' or 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Nor should they be expecting garbage like Nazi Zombies, but I have to remind the Historian that this movie was not made to be historically accurate, so don't attempt to compare everything to reality especially with it's limited budget.

Add to that the fact that the U.S sniper has a rifle with a modern after market no drill/tap scope mount, and I suspect that the scope itself is not even correct for that rifle!

As others have said, what starts off with some promise soon becomes a dumbed down mess - with German soldiers no smarter than rocks. Every U.S bullet hits its mark, near every German bullet misses or goes astray despite overwhelming forepower!

I guess Germans can't smell or see the smoke coming from behind a tree in the cold of night. Ammo, they got ammo. These soldiers on the run fired thousands of rounds, most of the missing their mark, but enough to kill those nasty bad guys, and the Germans replied with thousands of rounds, mostly missing their mark.

3444898,2,B0019ZS0GG,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!

War movies don't necessarily have to be dead-on accurate.  Band of Brothers, the greatest of them all, takes a few historical liberties, and Glory, the best Civil War movie ever made, makes a lot of historical errors.  Both films get away with it because they maintain historical credulity, and they are well made films.  Company of Heroes doesn't come close on either account.  Its low budget shows, and the story is so inane as to make a Vin Diesel film seem rational.  Moreover, the biggest name in the film, Tom Sizemore, is fat as no soldier in the American GI was after spending six months in the field.

The film begins in December 1944 at the start of the Battle of the Bulge, a promising opening that soon deteriorates into absurdity.  Our company of heroes is a small American unit cut off in the Argonne Forest.  A German patrol comes down the road during the night, and the American boys hide in the woods.  What are they doing while trying to escape detection?  Smoking!  As if the Germans couldn't see cigarette glow in a pitch black forest.  Guess what?  They can't!  Not only that, the GIs are hiding behind trees half their body widths, and the Germans can't see them when they scan with their high powered search light.  The Americans kill most of those Germans, escape, and take the place of a dead spy to complete his mission, which they discover has something to do with an atomic bomb, the concept of which seems to be immediately understandable to all of them.  They have to contact a German spy in Stuttgart and hop a German prisoner train to get there.  That's right: a German train going INTO Germany.  To get on board, they shoot down dozens of really stupid Germans who continuously run single file into the line of fire.  Despite their obvious presence on board, the train pulls out on time.  The Americans arrive safely at Stuttgart now joined an escaped British airman and a Russian soldier.  The Germans are waiting, but - you guessed it - fall by the hundreds as the Americans fight their way into town.  While there, they kill a few more Germans for their uniforms and walk down the street speaking English in normal voices, the Russian included.  Meanwhile, the Germans, although knowing they've been infiltrated, do nothing to increase security or locate their foe.  The Americans meet their German contact, who, of course, is a beautiful young woman.  She takes them to her house where she insists they are safe and, in a pointless scene, conveniently forgets to close the bathroom door so the film's hero can view some German booty et al.  Once dressed, she informs them that the Nazi's first atomic bomb test had fizzled but a reluctant German scientist (her father we later learn but which we've already surmised) has resolved the technical problem.  The Americans' mission is ensure a second A-bomb is deactivated and destroyed and the plans sent to the Allies.  (Earth to writer:  the Germans didn't have one atomic bomb, much less two.)  And last but not least, in the big climax, an American bombing raid levels the atomic bomb factory but does so at such a low altitude that the explosions might take out the planes, too.  (Earth once again to writer:  The Army Air Corps never did a bomb run at that low an altitude.)

The film is a historical joke and not a very good film in any other regard.",1367366400,17,3359,4.646859083191851

3444903,3,B0019ZS0GG,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Military action flicks, especially World War II films. Considering who is in this film I may have expected too much from the producers. In ""the making of"" segment, the director talked about how War Movie buffs expect a lot of 'accuracy' and how they strove to give us just that, with the uniforms and weapons, the vehicles and whatnot. So, I expected to see Tiger I tanks like the ones in Kelly's Heroes and Saving Private Ryan. Not so. First off, every WWII 'buff' knows what German armor looked like, the colors the size and shape, things like that. The first glaring error was the Rebel gray paint schemes used on thier two types of Soviet armor they rented for 'two days' That was all they ""could afford"". German WWII armor was painted a combo pattern of Desert Sand, Black Green 'squiggles' with Red Earth 'squiggles', and overpainted during the winter months with Whitewash temporary colors.
The two former Soviet vehicles they used in the film were 'modified' to appear less Soviet and sort of like German armor, but in reality the lack of knowledge displayed by the films Military adviser really screwed things up. The ""Tiger I"" looked like no piece of armor I have ever seen. Long Story short: For me, the really crappy armor really destroyed any enjoyment I could have taken from a great script (which it wasn't). The half-scale 88mm anti-aircraft gun/cannon didn't help. It was constructed of PVC pipe and looked OK if you didn't look directly at it.
Unfortunately, the majority of the explosions were quarter scale. Artillery or tank rounds are impressive when they detonate, and as a combat veteran who has had a variety of ordnance thrown at him, I know of which I speak. The detonations in Windtalkers came the closest to reality of the many films I've been blessed to watch.
The actors tried hard, the script was quite trite and 'been there, done that' familiar. Here's a scene: Dark of night, frigid, snow covered forest, men hiding behind trees from the searching Nazis and their lights and guns. Sounds thrilling no? Picture trees not wide enough to conceal the soldiers hiding behind them. Oh, and they're SMOKING CIGARETTES and blowing smoke into the air and look like there's a forest fire! The Nazis SEE NOTHING, sort of like Sergeant Schultz from Stalag 13!
Yet, there were some pretty good spots. Not enough for me to feel good about spending my money on this film instead of Dora the Explorer for my baby girl. Netflix it, and decide for yourselves. I wouldn't buy it again.",1365724800,6,2534,4.696629213483146

3444907,3,B0019ZS0GG,"Back in 2006, ""Company of Heroes"" became the highest rated real-time strategy videogame for the PC.  Developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ, news of a film adaptation inspired by the video game and true events from World War II began to materialize.

But due to the unknown climate of the video game industry and THQ filing bankruptcy, not much was known about the status of the live action film.

While Relic Entertainment was sold to Sega in January 2013, thus prolonging the life of the ""Company of Heroes"" video game series, the film which was originally to be released in theaters is now being released direct-to video on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

Directed by actor Don Michael Paul (""The Garden"", ""Who's Your Caddy?"") and written by David Reed (""Supernatural"", ""Battlestar Galactica""), the low budget World War II film would star Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Heat""), Chad Michael Collins (""Lake Placid 2), Vinnie Jones (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""Swordfish"", ""Snatch""), Dimitri Diatchenko (""Chernobyl Diaries"", ""Get Smart"", ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""), Neal McDonough (""Captain America: The First Avenger"", ""Minority Report"", ""Flags of Our Fathers""), Jurgen Prochnow (""Das Boot"", ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""The English Patient"") and Richard Sammel (""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Casino Royale"").

VIDEO:

""Company of Heroes"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and featured in 1:78:1 aspect ratio.  First, I need to emphasize that this film was made with a low budget and this is not a huge World War II production.  While Director Don Michael Paul knew the budget limitations for ""Company of Heroes"", for the most part, he was able to make things work by focusing on the characters and for surroundings, making things ominous by having the characters in snow and around trees and branches.  But skin tones do look natural, close-ups were very effective and black levels were very good.

The film relied on characters taking action during the dark or in the snow and for that, it does give an ominous presence towards the film. But what makes the film feel like World War II is through the costume design by Anna Gelinova (""Hitman"", ""Expendables 2).  While I'm not an erudite on World War II garb, the crew did their research in trying to make the film look as authentic as possible with the limitations that they had.  You're not going to see a wide shot of a plethora of tanks or hundreds of soldiers but the shots and action sequences were carefully planned.  I didn't need so much to see blood spurting out as much but the film does look good on Blu-ray and for the most part, I do feel that with the budget that the crew had, they made the film feel right in terms of presentation.  I didn't notice any aliasing or specks or any problems with picture quality during my viewing.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Company of Heroes"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Fortunately, there are a good number of heavy action scenes that utilized the surround channels with efficacy.  Dialogue is crystal clear, as well as musical score by Frederik Weidmann (""Hostel Part III"").

Subtitles are in English, Engish SDH, Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional), Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), Dutch, French, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Company of Heroes"" come with the following special features:

  Deleted Scene: Kestrel and Squad Meet in a Safe House - (2:57) One deleted scene.
  In the Trenches - (10:28) Featuring interviews with Director Don Michael Paul, producer Jeff Beach and the cast and discussion of the differences between the film and the video game.
  Fabricating World War II - (5:41) Director Don Michael Paul discusses making a war movie and trying to make it look authentic as possible on a low budget.

EXTRAS:

""Company of Heroes"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The first thing that fans of ""Company of Heroes"" will wonder is ""if the film is any good?"".

I can understand.  A low-budget war film that went straight from direct-to-video and a director who does not have an A-list film to his credit may turn some people off.

But you never know as one may be able to make something incredible as Stanley Kubrick accomplished with a very low budget for his film debut and his war film, ""Fear and Desire"".  Or something disappointing and not worth your time.

With Don Michael Collins, I have to say that when it comes to a popcorn action World War II film, he was able to create an entertaining film despite operating with a low budget.

First, let me just say that this is not a film that is deep in plot.  Nor is it a film where one who is used to watching big budget action, will see a plethora of tanks, soldiers or a film about company bravado like the ""Band of Brothers"" TV series.

But what we have is a war film about a group of soldiers facing a significant challenge in recovering a defecting German scientist who is in charge of a secret weapons program.

While some may feel it is farfetched to have four soldiers (two Americans, one British and one Soviet) accomplishing a mighty task, this is not one of those films where you search for World War II accuracy.  Like the video game in which operations are inspired by true events but not exact events, having played many World War II video games, part of that excitement in the video game is trying to defeat the enemy, with what you have.  In this case, not much of trying to defeat the enemy with a large military force but to find the German scientist and leave!

I don't care to see much in a war film is the overuse of blood squirting out of someones neck nor do I want to see a love angle in a war film.  The film incorporated a little of each but nothing that made me feel too bad about the film.

As for the positives...a positive factor about this film is that it incorporates a few well-known names who have appeared on major big budget war films.  Tom Sizemore is best known for his roles in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", Neal McDonough had appeared in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot"" and ""The English Patient"" and Richard Sammel of ""Inglorious Basterds"" and you have others who also appeared on bigger budget film as well.

With a tight schedule, low budget and only a day to film with a tank but still make the film feel believable and authentic, I just felt that with what Don Michael Paul had to work with, he and his crew did a good job.  Anna Gelinova was able to make the costume design feel right and to have cinematography focus on locations that take part in the dark, around snow or dirt, the crew and cast managed to make things work!

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality was very good.  Great detail on close-ups.  Lossless audio also featured good use of the surround channels and there were a few special features included.  It would have been great to have audio commentary included with this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Company of Heroes"" is a popcorn action World War II film that may not be as memorable compared to many other World War II films out there, but I did find it entertaining.  Will fans of the video game enjoy this film?  I think that it will be subjective, but I do feel that for its low budget and the fact that the film does star a several well-known talent, the end result was much better than I expected.",1364601600,2,7645,4.715361445783133

3444916,3,B0019ZS0GG,"The film has unnecessary subscripts as to the locations, as the scene informs you where they are at. Also the opening gives you the basic plot. A group of men are trapped behind enemy lines post Battle of the Bulge and find a great weapon being developed by the Nazis. You could have figured all of this out by yourself- really.

What makes pseudo histories are the characters. This film concentrated on one particular character, sniper Nate Burrows (Chad Michael Collins) pretty much to the exclusion of everyone else. Vinnie Jones was a welcomed addition. Some of the scenes worked well, while others were simply bad, making this a very haphazard production. I loved the scene of the killing of the German soldiers done to the opera of ""Faust."" Shades of ""Clockwork Orange."" However, the CG graphics of the planes and gun fire flames was noticibly fake. What really hurt this film is that they squandered dialouge which should have been better utilized to build character rather than conceal it, as in the case of the main character.

Makes for a rental for Vinnie Jones fans. Vinnie knows bar fights.

3444919,1,B0019ZS0GG,"First off, I didn't know this was based on a video game and was sucked in by the actors involved - it is sad to see Jurgen Pronchow and Sizemore reduced to doing something like this.  I love war movies, but I had to keep fast forwarding through this one just praying it would eventually end - one of the worst researched and poorly made WWII flicks I've seen in a looooong time.  The camera work is excellent, but aside from that, this movie is a complete train wreck.

Here's the short list; the makers admitted they had a limited budget - if so, hire lesser named actors and make a better movie.  The vast majority of the helmets worn in this movie are plastic and fiberglass, and it shows; they don't fit well, they look like plastic, and they bounce all over the place - not to mention, most of the Germans are wearing WWI ""Coal Scuttle"" helmets for some reason, not WWII helmets.  They also only had a few German uniforms for the hundreds of suicidally stupid German soldiers who mindlessly run headlong into machine gun fire over and over again.  To make up for this, they simply put the Germans in E. German overcoats (almost all of them) to disguise the fact they don't have uniforms.  The main ""bad guy"" German in the flick is an enigma, as he wears an Army Oberst's uniform with a Luftwaffe pilot's badge as his only breast decoration, yet he also has the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, and he's wearing an Army cap with a Luftwaffe wreath on it and an SS eagle sewn over that - and his overcoat has an SS eagle on the sleeve - that's some serious research!  Likewise, his adjutant wears a Heer lieutenant's uniform with an SS officer's visor cap throughout.  And all of the ""SS"" troops have Heer decals on their helmets.  In one scene, they go to an opera house, where this officer's box is festooned with Fuhrer Standards and the outside of the building has them all over the place as well - guess they thought they looked pretty.  And, of course, everything touched by the Germans has a swastika on it, just like in the 1940's movies - regardless of whether it's a truck, a box, a pack of cigarettes, and yes, even brick buildings (no lie, the secret German factory has multiple large white swastikas just painted randomly all over the brick walls) have big swastikas painted on them so you won't get confused.

The American stuff is equally bad - the uniforms and equipment are terrible.  One reviewer mentions the German G43 sniper rifle a GI is using, but he doesn't mention it's a POS rifle with a modern hardware store scope on it and a homemade mount and the barrel is missing its sights - even the rifle is a piece of junk.  There's only seven or eight GI's really in this movie, but even at that, one's carrying a British .303 Enfield, one appears to be carrying a CZ24 bolt-action Mauser-type rifle, and the others all have Thompsons - and every German is equipped with an MP40, across-the-board, all of which have endless magazine capacity.  Oh, but let's not overlook the German machine-gun team at the beginning of the flick, that for some reason is using a WWI Austrian water-cooled HMG.

There are a number of very poorly disguised Russian T-34 tanks in this movie which are garbed up and painted gray to look like godknowswhat, but they don't look like anything in particular and I imagine they were borrowed from another movie given the budget these guys had.  Problem here too is they are identified as the ""12th Waffen SS Panzer Division"" which played a very small part in the Ardennes Offensive and, as stated, everybody in the 12th SS in this movie is wearing regular German army uniforms and despite being the Hitler Jugend Division, these guys all look like they're in their forties.  When they do close ups on the tanks, it gets worse, as you can see they're missing the hull mounted machine guns, have rust streaks all over them, and they're in terrible condition - they look like they've been sitting on a Hungarian back lot for ages.

The plot of the movie, if you can call it that, is simply absurd and the dialogue is absolutely terrible - a teenager could've written a better and more believable movie.  I've only played a couple of WWII video games on a couple of occasions, but I came away from those experiences much more impressed than I was with this movie.

Don't be sucked in by the big names involved, this movie is a disaster and it'll end up in my next garage sale or thrift store donation.",1362700800,27,4443,4.494409937888198
3444920,1,B0019ZS0GG,I've heard of 'B' movies before -- this is a 'D' movie. Two pretty well known actors lure you in but the story was ridiculous & the acting was atrocious--all in all even the most avid military buffs (like my husband) wouldn't recommend ths movie.,1362614400,13,246,4.488888888888889

3444923,3,B0019ZS0GG,"If you just enjoy shoot-'em-up combat scenes and a few inaccuracies won't bother you too much, COMPANY of HEROES definitely has its share (of both). Pretty good cinematography too: While it isn't the sort of film one normally watches for the lush scenery, there are some stunning shots of the Ardennes in winter.

On the other hand:

Lots of staid, corny, unrealistic dialogue (""Too much firepower--Move out, NOW!"", etc). The premise of a ragtag group of Americans, Brits, and Russians sneaking into Stuttgart via railway in December, '44, in order to destroy the Germans' big new secret weapon is interesting. Alas, however, even though there are some complications here and there, this film makes it all look frightfully easy. Several bothersome inconsistencies such as Russian soldiers who just happen to speak perfect English and SS officers who alternate indifferently between German and English. The acting is mostly forgettable, though Neal McDonough, Alastair Mackenzie, and Melia Kreiling give pretty good performances. (Kreiling also strips briefly in order to spice things up.) The sheer number of characters, some of whom are completely unnecessary, adds a lot of confusion.

All in all, a riveting but rather stupid war thriller.",1362441600,4,1242,5.326530612244898
3444924,4,B0019ZS0GG,"Do you remember the episode from Hogan's Heroes where Hogan's team needed to thwart the German transport of a shipment of ""heavy water"" and the little French guy drank the water and soon learned that he drank heavy water.  Historically no one at that point knew what heavy water was and how it was necessary to the development of a nuclear bomb because no nuclear bomb had been detonated at the point.  Basically this movie is a well produced, big budget, awesome full cast and crew of that episode.  If you demand historical accuracy, this isn't the movie for you.

Hope they make another one with bigger budget.",1361836800,3,350,4.014285714285714
3444927,2,B0019ZS0GG,"This flick is loosley based on the video game by the same name.  It's a low budget yarn featuring Tom Sizemore, perhaps coming back from endless personal problems.  A US Army unit during a routine mission is by chance immersed into the Battle of the Buldge. Then practically down to last man, inherites a mission that could determine the outcome of the war.  The begining is quite promising, but as the film progresses it slips into some mindless dialogue and dimminished CGI effects.  The Nazis are portrayed as dumb as rocks and are slaughtered in hordes.  The culmination is what blossoms into a shootem-up movie version of the game.  Great to watch with beer and pretzels!",1361836800,22,676,4.7844827586206895

8275676,1,B0019ZS0GG,"This fiasco is supposedly based on true events but not that I can tell. The movie makers clearly did not know much of anything about history, the Battle of the Bulge, atomic bombs, WWII or anything else. Just when I think I've seen the worst war movie ever I find another this one. This has to be at the top of the list for bad movies. The soldiers in this movie are from the 2nd Infantry Division. After an encounter with a sniper they are at Elsenborn Ridge. While the 2nd was in the general area, Elsenborn Ridge was held by the 99th. The 2nd moved in later. At the start of the movie, it says the date is December 16th, 1944. I don't think a patrol would have been walking around in broad daylight unaware of a German presence on December 16th since the Germans opened the battle early in the morning with a massive artillery barrage that would have been hard to miss. By the time these guys were walking around on a quiet day the battle would have been well underway. Not only do they not know that they are in the middle of a battle, they are ordered to deliver Christmas dinner. they are ambushed on their quest to deliver dinner. They eventually run into German infantry and tanks. The tanks looked silly. They were Russian T-34s with some sort of additions added to the turret in a very lame attempt to make them appear German. The job was so badly done that I can't even guess what type of German tank they were pretending to be. Also, German tanks would not have been painted dark gray at this time. Somehow our intrepid heroes end up in Germany where they discover the Germans are making a new kind of bomb (that would be the atomic bomb). Long story short, they take on a mission for which they have no training or information. All they know is that they have to go to Stuttgart (which was no where near Belgium and the Battle of the Bulge). They go by train after slugging it out with the Germans. Since the Germans know they are on the train, one must wonder why they didn't stop the train and finish them off. Once they arrive in Stuttgart, they acquire German uniforms and are walking around the city with no personal knowledge of the city or the German language. The Germans who fought them at the first train station have somehow beaten them to Stuttgart but, instead of hunting them down, have decided to go the opera where one of the soldiers, who cannot speak German, meets up with a contact who tells them where the bomb is being assembled. Off they go, all four of them (including a Russian they picked up during the Battle of the Bulge and a British pilot who has apparently undergone Commando training). They enter a highly secure facility without challenge and then do what silly movie heroes do...they beat the hell out of the Germans. Although captured after running out of ammunition and facing a firing squad, they are saved by a U.S. bomb raid. A P-51pilot apparently knows that he has to take out the firing squad. This results in silly chase sequences. Ultimately, our heroes steal the truck on which the Germans had loaded their atomic bomb and somehow manage to drive it through Germany and the occupied territories to American lines...but they are not permitted to talk about their mission. Very hush, hush. I could go on about the stupidity in this movie but let's settle for some hi-lites: B-17s don't fly just above roof tops to drop their bombs; The escaping truck with the A-bomb is equipped with an American walkie talkie which is used to communicate with P-51s who fly down to save the day--walkie talkies did not have the range or frequencies to talk to aircraft; somehow the P-51s know the Americans are below and know their precise location, so, immediately respond to their request for help--the request is made using modern alpha-numeric procedures not WWII's, and the coordinates were gibberish; the Germans can't shoot well enough to hit the broad side of a barn; The Geiger counter used by the German looked pretty modern and would he be walking around a radioactive area?; and so on.",1514764800,3,4036,4.537722908093278
8275677,1,B0019ZS0GG,"Predictable and unrealistic outcomes of battles; 4 ""good guys"" take out a platoon of German soldiers and of course, the highly trained German platoon cannot shoot or fight worth a damn. Not a good or realistic movie, very loosely based on actual events. Yes, WWII occurred, the setting in which this movie is based, but that is about as accurate and realistic as this ""B"" home movie gets.",1510272000,2,388,4.720588235294118
