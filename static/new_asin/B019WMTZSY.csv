7584223,5,B019WMTZSY,"This show has EVERYTHING... sci-fi mixed with history mixed with fantasy mixed with romance mixed with police procedural drama...  I have NO IDEA why ABC pulled it from their line up... they haven't found a worthwhile show to fill that time slot yet!  Henry is a man who is ""cursed"" to live forever... the twist is that he can die... he just pops up again in the nearest body of water with all memories intact.  He has found his way to NYC and is the medical examiner fascinated with death... he teams up with a NYC detective and they solve crimes together... The writing was clever, the relationships were superb from Henry's relationship with the detective, to his 70+ year old son to his assistant to his arch nemesis... this show is SORELY missed.  It breaks my heart to see it listed as ""the complete series"" when it was only one season....",1452902400,51,845,4.5394736842105265

Was hoping for someone to buy it up and make more seasons but what can you do. Loved every character on the show.  Loved almost every episode.,1452556800,24,268,3.925925925925926

7584227,5,B019WMTZSY,"Not only superbe cast and good acting (including a legend like Judd Hirsch), Forever deals with tough philosophical issues of life, while staying light, funny, sexy, but with no goer or  sexual explicit scenes . This is a real candy of a TV show, don't thing I've seen something alike since the early seasons of The X Files. I got so upset when it was cancelled by ABC, I only hope Warner Brose (who ones the rights) will try again and again to shop until a new home for Forever be found. I don't get TV these days ...",1452297600,33,518,4.232323232323233
7584228,5,B019WMTZSY,"One of my favorite series of 2014/15, so sad that it wasn't renewed.
I wanted to let everyone know that if they order it from Amazon's Canadian division it is much cheaper (31 U.S. dollars including the shipping). You will also get manufactured DVDs, not burned MOD DVD-Rs.

This release was teased , then announced by the producer for a pre-Christmas release but delayed until January.  Warner didn't think this would sell well in the U.S. so they went the ""Made On Demand DVD-R route"".  I encourage all fans to buy this.  Big sales could spark new interest in the series.

Forever is an intelligent mix of Science-Fiction with Procedural Police mysteries.  This is a drama with a sense of humor.
When the writers feared they would not be renewed, they gave the series a closure in the last episode that would allow the series to continue should the network decide to keep it going.  So you won't be left hanging at the end of ""season 1"".",1452124800,157,939,4.586826347305389
7584229,5,B019WMTZSY,"This is one of those series that should have been renewed for a second.  There was so much more that could have been done with the characters and so much more we could have found out about ""Henry"".  But as usual the networks never know when they have a good one.  We worked hard on twitter and facebook to have it renewed but to no avail.  But I am definitely buying this when it comes out on DVD.  I heard they are going to have some added features such as extra scenes never seen before.  This was a great show watch the DVD you'll see what I mean.  Ioan Gruffudd is wonderful as Dr. Henry Morgan.  He played him to perfection.  I don't want to give too much of the story away it will spoil the fun but enjoy.

Update after viewing the DVD's and getting Amazon's help. Has anybody noticed that the music is different then the actual series?",1452124800,75,842,4.20625
7584249,5,B019WMTZSY,"Viewing the episodes of ""Forever"" on DVD I am once again astonished this show was not picked up for a second season.  What was so terrible about this program that it did not deserve a sophomore year?  The writing could not be the problem for the plots offer plenty of twists and the dialogue is crisp and witty.  Each of the characters are fleshed out and allowed to tell their own story as the episodes unfold.  Even Nora and Abigail who are a part of the past of the storyline are given their stories rather than being mere shadow figures who flint across the background of the tale.
  The setting cant be the problem for New York City is presented here in glittering glory with dizzying aerial shots of the buildings and beautiful views of the waterways.  We not only see the city as it is, but also as it was in the 70s, the 60s and beyond.  Seeing the city from so many angles makes it as much a character in the development of the story as the people we meet along the way.
  My favorite setting in the story was Abes Antique Shop, which holds solid bits of the past.  I enjoyed all the lights and lamps displayed in the shop and the living quarters of the building.  Each time a scene was set in the shop my eye was caught by the various hanging light fixtures and the lamps on the tables.  In every episode there seemed to be a new nook or corner in the building where one could enjoy a cup of coffee or curl up with a good book.  Somehow the lights, the paneling, the upholstery of the rooms added to Henrys claim of being ageless.
  So why was ""Forever"" not selected for a second season?  Were the camera angles, the chemistry between the actors, the careful but steady development of the storyline simply too perfect for the small screen?  Granted some of the episodes seemed to be a rehashed telling of ""Castle"" episodes, but the rehashing was clever and tasteful.  A couple episodes contained storylines that are to be expected in tv crime dramas; the boxing club and the night club, but again these versions gave a tasteful and imaginative telling of the old story.
  Was the strange twist of Henrys life a little too weird for prime time?  Surely the post-modern viewer enjoys some extra essence of reality to the plotline of a tale.  The idea of immortality has been explored in other tv plays.  This is not such a bold new venture into new territory for tv writers that the concept was beyond the ability of viewers to grasp.  The point could be made that Adam was a distraction to the plot at times and his character might have been a little too vicious too quickly for a comfortable development of the over-all storyline.  Still, his part in the plot opened questions about death and immortality which would not have otherwise come up in conversation.
  These minor flaws are easily offset by the clever plots of the murders and the careful development of the personality of each character.  One can only suppose the demise of ""Forever"" after only one season must reflect on the art of tv programing rather that the art of the shows story-tellers.  ""Forever"" had few viewers?  Well, now it seems that tv programing across the networks have few viewers.  Maybe there is a clue there in those details, but Henry has moved on and there is nobody to decipher the cause of this slow death.
  As for content of the DVDs, I did not notice a change to the music.  I did notice the Lieutenant had more screen time in the shows and the character came across as more likeable than in the broadcasts of the series.
  Also, the writers did bring the storyline to a sort of closure with several plot lines having an ending, so the viewer isn't left dangling with a dozen questions of what happened next.  Yet, to know what happened next would have been fun to find out.",1521417600,,3774,4.447521865889213

His medical knowledge and ability to deduce things from the smallest details (from experience accumulated over the 200 years he has been alive) end up making him an asset to the police. Throughout the season we learn more about his past, his losses, heartaches, the love of his life - and it helps the audience relate to feelings we too have experience. It allows us a background into why he became the kind of person he is. Never really a dull moment, but not action-packed, it's a good story overall. Although it would have been better to have the story continue in a second season, they at least sort-of wrapped up the series for us fans in a way that we are not left completely lost & hanging.",1502496000,,747,4.420289855072464

7584315,5,B019WMTZSY,This is one of the best series ever made. It is mind boggling how it got cancelled. Ioan and Alana have spectacular chemistry. Ioan deserved the Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama Series. The writing and production value were incredible for network TV. ABC made a horrible mistake canceling it.

So I am thrilled I am able to revisit it at my leisure. I have been a Ioan Gruffudd fan since he played Horatio Hornblower (Original series of books written by C.S.

7584344,5,B019WMTZSY,Great series!  Well written and well acted.  Hated to see it end after only one season!,1490486400,,87,4.375
7584345,5,B019WMTZSY,"Thats a one-year series with twenty-two episodes of forty-one minutes that comes to a conclusion that cannot be stepped over without the series becoming repetitive and thus boring if it did. Imagine one man who has lived for more than two centuries and is well say eternal, in fact, he will never die but he was born. He had a starting point but he has no end. So he is living a never-ending life. In such a series you cannot really discuss the central element without violating the whole suspense.

It discreetly deals with the Second World War and Auschwitz since Dr. Henry Morgan (is he a relative to Dexter Morgan?) has a son who he recuperated as a new born baby when he liberated Auschwitz, which by the way is impossible since it was liberated by the Russians. But well, lets dream a little bit. He is called Abraham and his mother, Dr. Henry Morgans wife at the time who discovered and adopted Abraham in the same circumstances and at the same time as Dr. Henry Morgan did, disappeared from their life when she was seventy-two or something along that line. Abraham wants to know what happened to her, since she was not eternal but was mortal. Abraham and Dr. Henry Morgan will manage to find the truth about this disappearance. It is sad and re-comforting in a way.

But there is another never-dying chap in the story, a lot older since he was killed the first time with one of the daggers that killed Julius Caesar. This chap considers that being killed a second time with the same weapon is the only way to stop this curse of a never-dying life. So Dr. Henry Morgan has to find that haunting stalker and to neutralize him. Add to this the fact that Dr. Henry Morgan was killed on a slave ship owned by his own father when he tried to liberate the slaves and imagine the fact that the ship got wrecked somewhere along the coast of New England or North East USA and it is brought back to the surface one day and they could not find the several hundred skeletons that should have been the slaves. The mystery and plot definitely thickens.

And whats more since Dr. Henry Morgan is working in the local morgue in New York, he is in contact with Detective Jo Martinez, who has lost her husband in unclear circumstances. It does not matter how anyway since the only thing we have to know is that she is a widow and her husband was the attorney general in New York or something close to that.

You thus have several lines that are crisscrossing one another and that interweaving makes the story funny, at times slightly hilarious because every single time Dr. Morgan is killed he is resuscitated in the East River in the nude and is arrested several times for exposing and exhibiting himself in full nudity in some public place. Every episode is a criminal case. Then Dr. Henry Morgan is running after his stalker, named Adam, which is a frankly nave name, to neutralize him, since Dr. Henry Morgan is no killer. Then Dr. Henry Morgan and Abraham have to find what happened to their wife and mother. We have to learn a little bit about the distant past and the not so distant past. And we have to deal with Detective Jo Martinez who is not completely blind to the bizarre situation of Dr. Henry Morgan.

That makes the series palatable and even at times very successful. Enjoy that new Morgan in your series universe, and remember we always need to have a little Morgan in some closet or cabinet in case of some emergency.

A very clever premise and plot of a young and charismatic  Doctor who is incredibly well read and refined who in reality is centuries old. In films and tv they say an actor really pops  if they intrigue you immediately well  Ioan Gruffudd  certainly does that, I gotta to say l was shocked when l found out he was welsh so convincing is he as a super refined and cultured man of mystery with a beautiful accent and a staggering  intellect. It had a monster following in Europe and millions of fans desperately tried to get it to a second season with computer votes of support alas to no avail.

7584492,5,B019WMTZSY,"""Forever"" was a show I knew I would love from the moment I heard about it. It had Ioan Gruffudd to start, from the ""Fantastic Four"" movies and the 'Horatio Hornblower"" movie series, who is a great actor. It had sci-fi and crime procedural but most of all, character. Each episode you have a crime and an investigation usually connecting to memories of Henry's past. Henry is immortal and he has a lot of memories of the past. Did I mention, he's a doctor? Henry is currently working in the morgue and is often tapped to assist the police in the current investigation. Each episode you learn a bit more about Henry and his very interesting past. You can feel his joy and pain as he looked back on his life and the people he loved, lost and lives he impacted.
I would have loved for the series to be renewed for several more seasons. I kept this series on my DVR until I saw it was being released on DVD. I didn't want to lose a great show. ABC has the tendency of cancelling great shows way too early. (Bad ABC) I'm so glad someone saw the value in ""Forever"" and released it on DVD.

Ioan Gruffud was fantastic as the immortal medical examiner; Alana de la Garza brought a tough-yet-sensitive spirit to her character of the police detective he works with, and the supporting cast was excellent, especially the always reliable Judd Hirsch.

7584536,5,B019WMTZSY,"Purchased Amazon-Canada - Binge on murderous crime, historical fiction and ageless romance in this genre-bending mystery series. Forever weaves through centuries of Dr. Henry Morgan's immortal journey by way of a sharp modern crime procedural with a great big heart. The venerable star, Ioan Gruffudd [Yo'an Grih'fith] (Amazing Grace, King Arthur, Fantastic Four) proves his leading man versatility ranging between nuanced vulnerability and violent action with seamless transition. He handsomely transforms the character through cultural ages and voices mellifluous narration that first straps you down then tucks you in for the mystery history ride.

The clever, unconventional family of characters stand out with multi-faceted depth, portrayed by an accomplished cast in sumptuous settings. Best of all, the investigative team is well matched in wit, wisdom, and folly. Every character pulls their weight, a hallmark of the Matt Miller TV team (Chuck, The 100) which has whipped up another alchemy of cast, story, and production value.

You'll care deeply what happens to Dr. Henry Morgan and all those in his life, Judd Hirsch (Taxi, Independence Day 1 & 2) playing Abe the father who's really a son, Alana De La Garza (Law & Order, Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders) as Jo, a discerning partner who sees the secrets in others but not herself , Donnie Keshawarz (Sopranos, Castle) as Hanson the punk busting tough guy, but a pushover with his kids, Lorraine Toussaint (Orange Is the New Black, Selma, Rosewood) as the captain who defies the grumpy, ineffectual stereotype with humorous insight, and Joel David Moore (Avatar, Bones) as Lucas, the wannabe filmmaker trapped in the body of a coroner's assistant.

The cast brings to life this exquisitely written, taught mystery thriller series with great affection and shocking villainous revelations. Forever satisfies, and still leaves you wanting more.",1458691200,6,1903,5.422297297297297

7584587,5,B019WMTZSY,"I initially found this show (by accident) on hulu.com and I LOVED it.  A little twist on the usual homicide cop/medical examiner show. Dr. Henry Morgan is a medical examiner in New York, and works with a homicide detective. Dr. Morgan is immortal and also 200 years old (looks 35), and lives with his 70 year old son Abe (played by Judd Hirsch) who runs an antique store. Abe is the only one who knows Henry's ""secret"".

I am so glad this show finally came out on DVD!!! I read one of the other reviews that said to buy via amazon in Canada because it was cheaper and not ""manufactured on demand"". I took that advice. Usually when the dvd's are made ""manufactured on demand"" they don't have any subtitles, but this DVD (ordered from amazon Canada) DOES have English Subtitles for the hearing impaired!  There are also subtitles in French and Spanish.
(and it was still cheaper even with having to pay shipping - and apparently my PRIME was honored as it got to me from Canada in 2 days). This is a GREAT show. Which is probably why it was cancelled - cancel the good ones, keep the crummy ones on the air. the ""extras"" are some deleted scenes. VERY entertaining show.",1456963200,2,1167,4.44392523364486

I was stunned and very disappointed that the series was axed after only one season - how can that be?!  It was the best show on TV!  I've signed the online petition for it to be renewed here: (...) If you feel the same, please also sign.  The popularity of the DVD sales will be key in getting Warner Bros to take notice.",1456012800,2,576,4.296296296296297

7584620,4,B019WMTZSY,"Cons:
1) They want a lot of money for what is essentially one season of a show. The price has changed a lot (up and down and up and down), I bought it when it was in the midway price of its current 2/14/16 cheapest price and the most expensive price.
2) My disc had 3 rough scene transitions
3) The deleted scene section shows all the episodes even the ones without scenes (those take you to the full episode, I don't know why they are there) and one deleted scene is under the wrong episode.
Pros:
I love this series so much that I am willingly to overlook being overcharged for it, because I wanted to own it so bad.",1455408000,7,618,4.115702479338843

I've had time to watch only a few episodes, but the DVDs are very high quality.

Then you get the whole immortal angle, and Henry Morgan trying to hide the fact when he keeps getting killed. While it sucks that they cancelled it the finale was a good one so that at least you're not left hanging.

7584659,5,B019WMTZSY,"This could really have been called a mini-series type program the way Henrys' & Abe's lives were shown from beginning to end.
This was a very imaginative & Wonderfully written series that made a person think, & actually follow the plots, which may have
been one of the reasons the Series was not renewed.
With Most People lacking attention spans & wanting immediate gratification & mindless programing a GREAT SERIES like this
one was, was definitely not for the Majority of the viewers.
But for those of us who were looking forward each week to this Fantastic Show knowing what a TREAT & RAREITY this show
was. This series was great to watch & follow along with, watch how Henry's life transpired thru History & was neat to watch how
Abe's life fit in & went along with Henry's.
Everyone associated with this Series should be PROUD of this program, & KNOW that even though it was not renewed, there
are MANY viewers who know what a loss it was losing this Wonderful program.
Each Actor, Actress, & ALL the Directors, Producers, Writers & Production Staff Members should remember they were involved with
something very, very special & it did show thru how all the Characters interacted with each other.
A real shame the show was not renewed, but just shows that the average viewer would rather have a mind-numbing program
that you can turn your brain off to watch.
Thank You to ALL who brought this Series to us, & try not to take it to heart because there are those who still love it & know what
a TREASURE it really is, & yes those who want the DVD set do buy it from Amazon Canada: it is just like you would find it in store here

7584663,4,B019WMTZSY,"Like most reviewers, I was bummed out when the decision was made to drop the series. I thought the series was quite interesting and entertaining. Fortunately I decided to purchase a season pass through iTunes and was able to watch these episodes at leisure; but I had always hoped they would release a DVD set of Season 1, and readily purchased a copy upon release.

I received the DVD's and began to watch each episode.. Here's what I found.

The Good
Bravo to WB for the excellent video transfer.  I found the clarity of the video quite sharp and detailed, almost HD quality.  Better than those in my iTunes library. The 5.1 audio is also quite good.  The season came with 5 discs, with 5 episodes and some deleted scenes on discs 1-4; and the last two episodes and more deleted scenes on disc 5.  The deleted scenes did provide some additional insight to some of the episodes, which added a bit more background to some of the episodes.

Not so good
While the video and audio were of high quality, I was disappointed to find they had changed the music soundtracks significantly in each episode.  Songs by artists, such as Arctic Monkeys, K.C. & the Sunshine Band, etc. were removed and replaced by ""filler"".. I had to compare the audio with my iTunes copies to ensure I wasn't dreaming.  While certainly not a deal breaker, it was nonetheless disappointing. I don't know why the PTB decided to modify the original soundtrack.  I can only assume it was done to cut corners.  (I have since discovered even episodes available in iTunes have changed as well; Only those copies I had downloaded the day after the original airing still contain the original audio soundtrack).

If you do not mind the audio switch, I highly recommend adding this series to your collection.  The stories are well written, acting superb, and the characters engaging.  I would have liked to give it a five star rating, but the altered soundtrack prevents me from doing so.

It's not bad.. But it could have been better if they had stayed true to the original score.",1453507200,18,2040,4.6434540389972145
7584664,5,B019WMTZSY,"Not sure who decides what series stay and what series go but this one should have continued.  I loved this show.  It was witty, comical with a little suspence and drama all in one. The actors chosen for the series were perfect for the parts that they portrayed.  I believe there needs to be a voting process put in place for the common people who enjoy good shows. Let them decide what shows should stay and what shows should go.",1453420800,5,429,4.3375
7584665,4,B019WMTZSY,"Forever: The Complete Series is a TV drama about Dr. Henry Morgan (Ioan Gruffudd), who has no idea why he hasn't been able to die in 200 years. Hes been killed many times yet always awakens naked in a body of water. Henry has chosen his job as a New York medical examiner because it has allowed him to search for clues to unlock the secrets of his immortality. As he investigates deaths, he hopes that whatever is causing him to outlive everyone he loves will be revealed.

Because of Henrys encyclopedic knowledge of history, sharp observational skills and British accent, its impossible not to think of him as a variation on Sherlock Holmes. Gruffudds Henry has a keen sense of humor, is likable, and never comes across as condescending or smug, even though hes almost always the smartest guy in the room.

Detective Jo Martinez (Alana De La Garza) is a recent widow who is not adjusting well to being single. To ease the pain of her loss, she drinks too much and engages in one-night stands. She and Henry team up in the shows pilot episode to investigate the deaths of 15 people who were killed when a subway car crashed.

Despite the supernatural element of immortality, Forever is essentially another police procedural show. Since Henry doesnt have the normal fear of dying, the show often veers into interesting territory. Gruffudd is a good-looking, excellent actor whos surprisingly not achieved big-screen stardom. He gives Henry just the right light touch as he and Det. Martinez attempt to solve crimes.

The only special feature on the 5-disc DVD release is a number of unaired scenes.",1453420800,4,1598,4.778985507246377
7584666,5,B019WMTZSY,"I don't watch a lot of TV. If I do, it generally is a documentary on PBS or a childhood favorite airing on a channel featuring shows from the 1980s and 1990s. It is rare when a scripted program both catches my interest and maintains it.

I began watching Forever, and I fell in love with it. It was the first time in about ten years since I fell in love with a TV series while it was airing in its first season. (The other show was Numb3rs.) Forever has everything I enjoy in a series: interesting storylines, mystery, suspense, humor, family moments, friendship, an educational aspect, the right amount of drama, romance, and more. In addition, it takes a philosophical look at life, love, human relationships, pain, aging, death, immortality, and the human condition as episodes tell the stories of both individual cases and the life story of one of the shows protagonists.

When it was cancelled, I was very disappointed.  I wanted, and still want, more episodes of the series. I still hope that a network, or even a streaming channel, would pick up the series and will begin producing it again. In the meantime, I bought the DVDs so that I can enjoy the shows first season again.",1453420800,6,1183,4.597156398104265

So many television shows are reality TV shows or shock factor shows or shows with premises that have been done to death.  As a result, I find most of television excruciatingly boring, but then I came across the trailer for this show and I was hooked!  This show was highly original and it is a shame that such an intelligent and compelling work of art was cancelled.  This was a procedural police show with the twist that the protagonist was immortal.  He thinks no one knows about his secret until he receives a sinister phone call.  The show blended the best elements of a procedural police drama and thriller with period pieces and science fiction and fantasy elements.  The acting was superb, the writing second to none, and it had all the makings of a sleeper hit.  Unfortunately, it was cancelled.  If there is ever a Season 2 (but I'm hoping for more!)

7584702,5,B019WMTZSY,"Very intelligent and intriguing storyline, heartwarming, smart and witty, with great actors. Ion Gruffudd is exceptional as Dr. Henry Morgan while the characters relationship with Abe Morgan, played by Judd Hirsch, is so refreshing and heartwarming. Also, love the witty relationship between Dr. Morgan and Lucas Wahl played by Joel David Moore.  The season finale does have a sense of finality so viewers are not left hanging.

When looking at the Nielson Ratings, I couldn't believe this show was cancelled after the first season even though it aired in a very late timeslot, one that has yet to hold any long running series.  The Monday, Sept. 22nd, 9 p.m. pilot garnered 8.26 million viewers + DVD viewers for a total of 11.84 million. Episode 2 aired on the following night at its regularly scheduled timeslot, 10 p.m., and garnered 6.62 million viewers + DVD viewers for a total of 10 million. By the final episode, 4 million people were still watching live and a total of 7 million when adding DVR viewings. These numbers are higher than ABCs Agent Carter that airs during primetime at 8 p.m. yet Agent Carter was renewed!

It is so frustrating when a fantastic show like Forever is cancelled while the same network continues to renew empty and talentless entertainment such as reality shows. I was expecting so much more from ABC with this show. Still hoping another network will see what a gem this series is and decide to make more episodes.",1453075200,8,1451,4.838709677419355

7584706,5,B019WMTZSY,"Forever is one of a kind type of show. It is classy, intriguing, and entertaining. I love this show because of the depth of the characters and the writing, both are not commonly seen in current media. Forever makes you think, laugh, and cry (almost all simultaneously sometimes). All of the characters on the show have wonderful chemistry together and each person is written well. You can truly feel for each characters' successes and struggles. Plus there are FANTASTIC quotes found within voice overs at the beginning and end of the episodes.

If you have never heard of the show, it focuses on the main character of Dr. Henry Morgan (Ioan Gruffudd) who cannot permanently die or age. He originally was born in England around the late 1700s. Henry currently lives in New York with his son and is working as a Medical Examiner alongside Detective Joe Martinez (a recent widow) for the NYPD. Throughout each episode there are flashbacks to different periods of time in the past connecting Henry's present to his past. The show takes you through the Henry's life and thoughts as he grapples with living forever.

So, if you enjoy shows with depth, charisma, class, and entertainment try FOREVER. I highly recommend this show, and I believe that you will not be disappointed!",1452988800,6,1273,4.861751152073733

7584742,5,B019WMTZSY,Forever is the best new series to come around in a long time.  It's so interesting and you can watch it with your family!!!!  Bummer that it only made it one season.,1452988800,5,165,4.125
7584743,5,B019WMTZSY,"Whoever claimed combining a weekly murder investigation with functional historic flashbacks and a subtle sci-fi twist would be impossible ? Well, think again because superior writing, top notch casting and superb acting has proven that it most certainly is!

Forever perfectly combines charismatic characters, intelligent storyline, honest emotions and a dash of humour.  The character interaction is simply amazing thanks to a really strong chemistry  between all of the characters, not just in romantic relationships but also in developing friendships and most certainly in the rather exceptional father-son relationship.

Casting Ioan Gruffudd as the main character was definitely a stroke of genius. Dr Henry Morgan could easily have been perceived as weird, arrogant, cut off from his emotions and  lets face it  a bit of a show-off. But Ioan Gruffudd managed to make Henry win the viewers hearts from the very first episode. His performance made Henry a classy, compassionate, loving man with a strong sense of morality and an emotional vulnerability that shines through in his actions and the dilemmas he faces. And yes, his pleasant appearance and lovely accent are a nice bonus!

Forever is an intriguing show in more ways than one: it does not only offer quality entertainment for the entire family (whether you are 10 or  235!)  but it also manages to link pertinent and thought-provoking moral questions to each episode without ever imposing any opinions or being judgemental.

And you have to admit: how cool is the idea of a 235 year old main character ?! Havent we all at some point wondered what it would be like to live forever? That premise certainly holds an infinite number of possibilities for interesting storylines, twists and turns!

This feel-good-show is definitely worth buying because it is an entertaining show the entire family can watch together! No wonder it managed to unite fans all over the world in their love and appreciation for the show and its cast !

7584744,5,B019WMTZSY,"One of the best TV series I've ever watched. It has a combination of a police/forensics drama with a scifi twist. Dr. Henry Morgan is immortal and works in the NYC morgue trying to learn more about death to discover the key to his immortality. Exceptional writers and actors lead to a story line that draws you in and keeps you wanting more. Ioan Gruffudd is amazing, along with the outstanding cast of Judd Hirsch, Alana De La Garza, Joel David Moore, and Donnie Keshawarz. They portray their characters in a way that the viewers really connect with their stories and personal challenges.

Ioan Gruffudd (gorgeous man) plays 200+ yr old Dr Henry Morgan, a man who cannot die. He has a 70+ yr old adopted son he rescued from the Holocaust. His 1st wife betrayed him when she discovered his secret and had him imprisoned in an Asylum for the insane. His 2nd wife had to watch herself grow old while he never aged. Through all the episodes, Henry tries to discover the secret of his immortality, would he ever be able to die? Such a shame this show wasn't given another season, it wasn't well advertised and was constantly pre-empted which is probably why the viewing numbers were low.

It's full of mystery, wonder, friendship, romance, family, with intriguing history sprinkled throughout! All the actors portray their characters believable ways that it's now hard to see them in other roles (but I will because they are all fantastic actors). I can't wait to get my copy of Forever so that I can relive the greatness that is Forever as well as share it with others to create new fans! I still have hope that Warner Bros will #ShopForever again in hopes of finding a new network or streaming service to buy it and make more episodes so us fans will know more of the long story that is Forever.

7584847,5,B019WMTZSY,"Thinking about buying this show/DVD? You have excellent taste. This show is incredibly well-written, well-acted, well-directed, just all around well done. Each actor has such phenomenal chemistry with one another. The main character Dr. Henry Morgan has voice overs in each episode. They are extremely thought-provoking and connects with its audience in many different ways. Each of Henry's flashbacks are very well woven into the case they're working on in modern day. And for a 200+ year old man, there is a lot of potential for sooooo many more stories, more immortals, more progression of the relationships between the characters, romantic or otherwise, or just in friendship. This show was just cut too short and I'm beyond grateful that this DVD has been made on demand for its fans: Foreverists. :) The supernatural element just works in it too. It's not too 'out there.' Everything about this show just works. Forever is the absolute best in all areas. I'm remaining hopeful that we'll get to see more from these beloved characters that have cemented themselves into our hearts... FOREVER.

Henry Morgan did say: ""What keeps us alive more important than blood or oxygen or even love... is hope.""",1452902400,7,1203,5.075757575757576
7584848,5,B019WMTZSY,"The Forever series was the best show put on TV in decades.  It is intellectual (a characteristic TV shows don't have these days), present-day and historical (and historically correct), family-friendly, and entertaining from the beginning to the end of each episode.  These are qualities that are not present in today's mediocre TV fare.  Ioan Gruffudd is the perfect Dr. Henry Morgan right down to his talented and skilled acting and his English accent.  The cast has no rivals on any series presently on the little screen Judd Hirsch is the creme de la creme of a group of actors who bring their characters into real life on the screen.  The secret that Dr. Morgan is immortal creates a unique storyline and the riveting writing maintains the high quality of each episode.  I have never enjoyed any series as much as I have the Forever series.  I am devoted to working hard, along with millions of fans in 99 countries around the world, to get this series renewed for a second season and more.",1452902400,7,994,4.710982658959537

7584850,5,B019WMTZSY,"This series was wonderful and did not deserve cancellation. It got screwed over by the outdated ratings system, a time slot that has a history of being bad for ABC, and a gross lack of marketing. Ioan really made Henry Morgan come alive. He made him seem real. I felt like I really was watching someone named Henry Morgan, not watching Ioan Gruffudd playing a character named Henry Morgan. The writers were great, the cast gelled so well together, and the stories were warm, funny, emotional, and moving. You cared about the characters, so you cared about what happened to them.

We fans are left with so many questions: How did Henry become immortal: the water? A spell cast by the man he saved on the ship?

Who is Adam? How can Henry die? How would Jo, Lucas, Hanson, & Reece have reacted to learning his secret? Would he have decided he didn't want to die after all, at least not for a while? Were Henry & Jo going to fall in love? What else were we going to see of Henry's past? So many questions left unanswered, and we don't know if they ever will be.

Henry Morgan character is probably one of the best roles I've seen Ioan Gruffudd in.  Story lines were entertaining and the way the final episode wound up, was great, answered some questions, but left the story wide open for a second series, there was so much more to discover in a second series.

Such a massive shame this got cancelled, I just don't get the networks - this had everything in it to be such a success, it just wasn't given any publicity or the chance to be the success it deserved.

The entire supporting ensemble was also excellent, especially Donnie Keshawarz. And bravo to the writer Matt Miller for the marvelous scripts.

We all felt every scene he was a part of and got sucked into his rich story line.
