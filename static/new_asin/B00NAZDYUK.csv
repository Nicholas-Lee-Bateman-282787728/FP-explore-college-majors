8677068,2,B00NAZDYUK,"As a beginning dancer, I was very disappointed in this DVD.  The production quality was very poor - very poorly lit, could barely see the dancers as they blended into the dark club background.  Just was not nearly as professional or helpful as other learn to dance DVD's as the others I have ordered.",1440720000,2,300,4.537037037037037

8677070,5,B00NAZDYUK,"I have never thought of myself to be gifted in any way whatsoever when it comes to that tricky art of dancing. I often feel awkward and out of place when it comes to parties or any event that involves clumsy dance floor maneuvering. Fortunately enough for me, Ive dramatically improved even though I thought of myself as a lost cause. Through these lessons, Ive benefited more than I thought possible (if you don't mind me bragging). The lessons are easy to follow along with and break down the technique so ANYONE can learn!",1412208000,,525,4.595744680851064
