8571008,5,B00BMTTXZQ,"Glyndebourne, with its intimate theatre and first class orchestra (here the London Philharmonic with Conductor Vladimir Jurowski), has always offered splendidly traditional yet highly inventive productions, and does so again here.  We are treated to none of the usual  Regietheater (German for director's theater) nonsense that has become so fashionable.  Instead we get a marvelously creative set, costumes, and production.  As the opera is quite short, there is only one set:  A tree under which lies the Vixen's burrow.  Behind this we can see the foxes moving inside the burrow.  The effect is quite striking and very clever.

The cast is headed by Lucy Crowe, whose precise intonation and quick vibrato are perfect for the role.  Her energetic impersonation of a fox is utterly charming.  Also outstanding is veteran baritone Sergei Leiferkus as the Forester.  His wonderfully heartfelt final monologue in act three will bring a tear to your eye -- it certainly did to mine.

Every time I hear this piece I begin to suspect that it is the finest opera ever written.  Well, it is probably not quite that, but has there ever been a work of such startling warmth, whimsy, and finally humanity?  We are left feeling that life goes on, and with the memory of some of the most beautiful and vibrant orchestral music I know, here played so beautifully.  Do not miss this!",1422921600,4,1369,4.942982456140351
8571009,5,B00BMTTXZQ,"This was my first experience with a staging of this opera.  I have an LP performance (Mackerras, Vienna) that I like very much but it certainly did not prepare me for the sex among the animal characters!  The entirely outstanding cast of dancers and singers, the remarkably intricate sets, and the whirling choreography all conquered the extreme challenges of this opera.  My initial reaction was to compare it to the performance of Berg's Lulu with nude scenes by Patricia Petibon,  However, Lulu is human while the sexual content of the Janek work is primarily animal, but still it is a bit of a shock.  I recommend viewing the Extras prior to watching the opera.  Jurowski couldn't have produced better sound throughout, especially in the orchestral interludes.  The picture and sound of the Blu-Ray recording are magnificent.",1380758400,3,829,5.051470588235294
8571010,5,B00BMTTXZQ,"... who makes or breaks any staging of The Cunning Little Vixen, an opera that has been getting more stagings in recent years than any other work by Leos Janacek. The Forester sings more passages, expresses more of Janacek's passions, and interacts with every other character, human of animal, in the opera. If the Forester is boring or buffoonish, as Jukka Rasilainen is in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Janacek-The-Cunning-Little-Vixen/dp/B001U1L9O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Janacek - The Cunning Little Vixen</a>, the whole opera sags into silliness. Luckily, Sergei Leiferkus is such a superb Forester, both vocally and dramatically, that he could carry the whole production without help. He gets help, however, from the three other male singers with important roles, Mischa Schlemonianski as the Priest, Adrian Thompson as the Schoolmaster, and William Dazely as the poacher Harasta. The smaller ""human"" roles of the Forester's Wife, the Innkeeper, and the Innkeeper's wife are also acted vigorously and sung ably. It's the humans who steal the show at Glyndebourbe; the various animals, both the singers and the dancers, are underwhelming, at least partly because the 'symbolic' costuming fails to vivify their animal natures. Lucy Crowe is adequate as the Vixen; her singing is okay (barely) but her physical presence is unexciting; she captures the Vixen's indignation at humanity but none of the Vixen's allure. Even more powerful help for the singers comes from the instruments of the London Philharmonic, with conductor Vladimir Jurowski. In short, this is a splendid ""concert"" even if you find the staging murky and pokey.

For all its bumptious humor, Cunning Little Vixen has a profundity in its libretto as well as its music that outreaches anything by  Janacek's near-contemporaries Strauss or Puccini. The Forester's paean to the beauty of Life and Nature is as touching as a Bach aria. His resignation and equanimity in the teeth of old age is more heroic than Siegfried's defiance. Cute costumes and the use of children as dancers/singers in the forest scenes can't be allowed to detract from that profundity. The costumes in this production are not, to my eyes, as charming as those in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cunning-Little-Vixen-Janacek/dp/B0043CT91M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cunning Little Vixen - Janacek</a>. Neither is the dancing, but I have to wonder whether the camera work and editing may have failed to capture the mood and color of the live performance. If I had to make a single recommendation of a DVD of CLV, it would still be the Mackerras/Allen/Jenis, but this is an opera worthy of multiple productions and multiple DVDs.",1371945600,4,2767,5.697336561743342
8571011,1,B00BMTTXZQ,"Unfortunately, all these reviews are of the earlier animated version of this opera, not the new release being promoted on this page.  Hey, Amazon, can we get the actual reviews?",1369094400,,177,4.9
8571012,4,B00BMTTXZQ,"With its charming depiction of life and nature, with the animals of the forest featuring throughout as characters, it's common to see Janek's The Cunning Little Vixen staged like a pantomime and aimed at a younger audience, even though some of the behaviour of the creatures is indeed quite frankly ""animalistic"". The opera is not of course essentially about animals but about life and, indeed, the facts of life, so it's interesting to see the opera treated with a more mature outlook for the 2012 production at Glyndebourne. It may perhaps lose a little bit of its innocent charm in the process, but there's more than enough gained from the usual fine attention that Glyndebourne give to the production - and the opera - as a complete package.

Rather than having children and older performers dressed in the usual colourful animal suits, the creatures of the forest are still characterised as animals here, but without the full make-up. Instead they carry only an object by which they can be identified, the idea seeming to be to remind us that their animal behaviour isn't all that different from humans.  A huge tree made up of a swirl of planks and a winding path/burrow are the two main features of Tom Pye's set, but care is taken place man both within this natural world and at the same time outside it.  The outdoor scenes are consequently bold and colourful, while the indoors scenes - kept in the Janacek's period and Moravian setting - are drab and monochrome by comparison.

The strongest element of the production however, and the one that most eloquently describes the natural world it depicts, is undoubtedly Janek's music itself, which is wonderfully played by the London Philharmonic under Vladimir Jurowski.  If there's any one concern it's a minor one about the pacing. Not the tempo. The rhythm and flow feel marvellous, but everything seems to fly past so quickly as if in a haste to get to the next scene, and it's all over before you know it. A bit like life I suppose - which may have been the intention. It's true that The Cunning Little Vixen is not a long work and Janek deliberately leaves no time for sentimentality about the natural order of things passing on and making way for renewal, but at the same time there seems to be little time in this production for you to connect with some of the most beautiful key moments and let them sink in.

This is particularly evident in the singing, which is fine throughout but tends to keep the singers - and consequently the audience - a little step removed from the characters, preventing them from really springing into life.  There is perhaps rather more care given to the human figures of the Forester and his colleagues, their disillusionment or sense of detachment with the true nature of the world preventing them from seeing their part in the greater scheme of things. If it the intention is to restore the human element back into a work where there can be too much emphasis placed on the cute antics of the animals, Melly Still's production certainly manages that, and in conjunction with the overall tone of the production it works well, revealing all the magnificent beauty of one of the finest works in all opera, even if it loses just a little bit of its innocent charm in the process.

The production comes across reasonably well on the Blu-ray release.  Some of the darker scenes have some post-production brightening applied, which creates a ringing halo around figures, but this isn't evident in more than one or two scenes.  Otherwise, the full colourful quality of the work is evident.  The audio tracks are the usual PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  Extras include a Cast Gallery and a 22-minute Making Of featurette, with interviews covering the concept, the music and the production design with some rehearsal footage.  The BD is all-region, BD25 (for a 97 minute opera), with subtitles in English, French, German and Korean.",1367798400,6,3929,4.777286135693215
