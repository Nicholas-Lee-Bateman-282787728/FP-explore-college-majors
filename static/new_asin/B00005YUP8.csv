1677934,3,B00005YUP8,"Released in '90 'Lena's Holiday' is a unchallenging but well-intentioned, mildly entertaining film. Predictable storyline, plodding script and no surprises at the end. However what it does have and the reason why it receives a 3 star rating is solely for the presence of the exceedingly lovely Felicity Waterman as Lena Jung. Who could resist falling in love with this naive, vulernable beauty with the cute accent who finds herself all alone in Hollywood with the wrong suitcase and a couple of murderers in hot pursuit. Also starring Chris Lemmon (Jack's son) as Lena's love interest. His physical resemblance, mannerisms and voice are so like his Father it's spooky.

Make no mistake about it, if you watch this film to its conclusion it's because you, like me, have fallen completely in love with Lena.",1159056000,6,806,5.014925373134329

7957257,2,B00005YUP8,"Felicity Waterman is indeed about the most winsome young woman imaginable, but that isn't enough to keep me watching lazy actors add their bits of ham to a plate of bland cheese.  Perhaps I'll crop out a few still images of Felicity and build my own screenplay around them, one that involves her moving into the house directly across the street from mine.",1518739200,,355,4.634920634920635

I recommend watching if you are tired of the same old romance stories....",1518048000,,136,4.1923076923076925

7957260,2,B00005YUP8,"After an emotional film of the wall coming down, Lena (Felicity Waterman) comes to LA to see the sights and show off her bad German accent. She gets her luggage swapped with criminal who come after her, but not before she meets a rich cabbie and does the frolic in sand and sun scene. The film is light and tries to be clever. It has some folks with name recognition such as Bill Dana and Pat Morita and Susan Anton.

Unlike my peers, I wasn't overly entertained. The accent was really bad. Available on multi-packs.",1474934400,,516,4.431578947368421

7957262,3,B00005YUP8,"As you should gather by now, the reason to see this movie, is to see the lovely Felicity Waterman. A stunning beauty. I found this included in a 12 movie set called, ""Big Screen Bombshells"", Quite a bargain. (Amazon, $ 5.00) She sure had me fooled. I was positive that she was really German. I knew a young German girl and Felicity had it spot on. That's called good acting.",1288051200,,374,4.357142857142857
