The story is interesting, but it is laid out in such a way that the history of the Meji restoration is revealed as well in addition to many of the cultural and political forces that ultimately shaped modern Japan. This second season focuses on Japanese military and political events from 1864 up to the beginning of the Boshin War (Japan's civil war) in 1868. The pace moves quicker than in the first season and includes quite a bit of action between rival clans, such as the Ikeda-ya Incident where the Shinsengumi (special police employed by the Aizu clan) discover and massacre several influential Ishin-Shishi leaders (Ronin allied to the Cho-shu clan) who were plotting secretly to burn Kyoto and use the confusion to kidnap the emperor and take him to Cho-shu. This is followed by the Kinmon Incident (also called the Hamaguri Gate Rebellion) where the Aizu and Satsuma domains ally and defend the Imperial palace against an attack by the Cho-shu clan that included rebels setting fire to Kyoto which destroyed half the city. Following the incident, the shogunate and Emperor move to punish the Cho-shu clan through a punitive expedition, which faltered because of an arms race for modern weapons, shifting alliances, and political intrigue. In order to bring down the Shogun, the western domains of Cho-shu, Satsuma, and Tosu secretly ally and take advantage of the sudden death of Emperor Komei in 1867 to force the new Shogun from office. Ultimately, the inability of the shogunate and its allies to outpace their rivals in obtaining modern arms leads to its fall and the establishment of Japan as a modern state along the lines of a representative democracy. In Aizu, Yae marries and continues honing her martial skills while working with her husband to perfect a modern rifle. She receives a Spencer repeating rifle as a gift from Kakuma and prepares for war along with the rest of the clan in the Aizu domain. Highly recommended!",1494979200,,2028,4.881159420289855
8620260,4,B00G2WY4N4,"Season 2 of Yae no Sakura leads up to the 1868 battle of Toba-Fushimi where the forces of the Tokugawa Shogun (including Yae's Aizu clan) clash with those of the new imperial government.

This season establishes the reasons behind the Boshin war and as such spends more time on politics than the previous 10 episodes did. In Kyoto, the clan lord of Aizu loses the powerful ally he gained in the previous season and is put in the situation of having to support the weaselly Shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, against young Emperor Meiji. (Aizu clan is a vassal of the Tokugawa clan and is duty bound to obey. It's reinforced throughout that Aizu clan is punctiliously dutiful to the point of self destruction.) Meanwhile, Yae's older brother (Kakuma) desperately tries to procure new rifles from foreign traders as he realizes that Aizu is losing the arms race against their enemy, the Choshu clan. He also deals with personal loss. Back in Aizu, Yae is surprised to receive a marriage proposal, and her little brother struggles to live up to his siblings.

I found this season a little harder to pay attention to as new political players are introduced and there are more back room negotiations. Most of these historical figures are well known to a Japanese audience (I presume), but to a Westerner without that background their changing loyalties and motivations can be somewhat confusing. The politics does seem to be intentionally simplified, though. Now that I'm part way through season 3, I can see why season 2 had to have all of the exposition it has, and season 3 makes good on the set up, but the most interesting parts of this season for me were the ones dealing with Yae and her family in Aizu. Yae's wedding and her parent's reactions to her unconventional marriage are quite entertaining.

This season is ten 40 minute episodes on 3 DVDs packaged in a nice fold-out cardboard case. Not sure what the cover is about as Yae never wears that kimono in the drama. Optional subtitles are in English or Chinese. The English subtitles are readable and intelligible.

All in all, a good set of episodes, but a little less addictive than season 1. Sets up season 3, which so far is really gripping, so definitely stick with it.",1482364800,,2224,4.739018087855297
