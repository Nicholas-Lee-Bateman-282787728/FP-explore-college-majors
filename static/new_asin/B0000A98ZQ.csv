1904193,2,B0000A98ZQ,"Yeah ok, so Sixteen Candles has the original soundtrack, while that is a very good reason to buy this re-issued DVD, it's not good enough! I have both 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club on DVD from it's first release and I will hold on to them until Universal releases a special edition! I want a REUNION commentary, featurette, deleted scenes, alternate scenes, outtakes, videos etc! Until then I am not spending more money on these dvds. I'm hoping when the 20th anniversary rolls around we'll get something worthy.",1063756800,5,516,4.808988764044944
1904194,1,B0000A98ZQ,"I have seen all three of these movies much like the rest of America's population.  I also love these movies and have contemplated purchasing them(especially Breakfast Club), but every time before i got to the checkout lane i would think; Why should i buy this dvd, i know the transfer is terrible and it isn't bringing anything new to the table i.e. deleted scenes, director commentary, making of featurette.  This was back in 1999.  So i waited for the day when the movies would be released with their proper respect.  WELL THAT DAY IS HERE... almost.  The visual transfer and sound are finally correct, so everyone should run out and buy this dvd (WRONG). We all know (including Universal) that the reason you buy dvd's are not only the visual quality but for the enetertainment value ie. deleted scenes, behind the scenes, alternate scenes, anything going on with scenes and it's a good day at the office. Universal doesn't give us anything, but expect us to spend our hard earned money.  I say, until all these companies get the point, don't purchase any dvd that doesn't have what the people want.  Would you buy a furniture set that doesn't have a couch you want, or if you wanted a cheese burger would you settled for a hamburger, no!!! You would (and should) demand to be served with some respect.  When companies omit what people want most they're showing they don't care for you as a consumer or human being. We have to make these companies listen and the only language they speak is money.  So speak their language and don't purchase until you get what you want. If we show a unified front we will get what we want.",1063584000,2,1626,4.598615916955017
1904195,4,B0000A98ZQ,"Here is some great news!  The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, & Weird Science have just been re-released on DVD in remastered style after very disappointing DVD transfers in the late 90's.
The Renunion collection allows purchasers the chance to buy all three DVD's in a package deal.  It makes sense to do this because it is cheaper than buying them separately.  In fact, you practically get one for free!  A friend of mine bought the package as soon as it was released.  I think it will sell out, so hop to it!
Each title has been remastered although they are not perfect.  Still, considering the age of these films, they look very pleasing.
All three are now 16:9 enhanced which is a blessing, no more large black bars top and bottom which plagued the 1998 DVD of ""Breakfast Club"" (for example).
Even better news for purists, is that the original soundtracks have been reinstated into the films. This is denoted on each separate cover, and is an important factor.  for too long we have had to put up with altered soundtracks. Sixteen Candles soundtrack was butchered so bad that the film lost its spark.  Well no more with this release.
The DVD's boast a DTS soundtrack for each movie.  Sorry, but it's nothing to write home about!  In the case of ""Breakfast Club"", the opening song ""Don't you forget about me"" still sounds very lame and mono as it did on the previous DVD release!  The same applies for portions of ""sixteen Candles"".  DTS can be a bit of a gimmick as demonstrated by all three DVD's.  Don't be fooled in this regard.
Extras? Sorry to report that Universal have decided not to include extras on any on any of the dics (except for trailers).  This is a shame because this is what DVD's are all about.  I can only assume that this is because DTS soundtracks take up considerable disc space.  What I would have liked is some deleted scenes or alternate scenes which do exist. For example, the TV version of ""breakfast Club"" is different to the DVD version, it contains several different scenes. Overall, there was approximately 4 hours of footage taken from Breakfast Club so to get some of this as an added special feature would have been nice Universal!!!  There are also alternate scenes out there for ""Sixteen Candles"" but you don't get to see them on this DVD.
Despite these let-downs, you must order this package deal because it's the best the films have looked in a long time. Plus the original soundtracks have been reinstated.  Another reason is that they will go out of stock for sure.  I've been watching my friends copy, and mine is on the way!!!  Cannot wait.",1063497600,53,2589,4.611353711790393
1904196,2,B0000A98ZQ,"As mentioned in my other reviews of the individual movies, both the Breakfast Club and Weird Science have audio remastering problems.
In the Breakfast Club, about 62min into the movie, Allison quickly says a few lines of dialogue that is noticeably out of sync to her mouth movements (Dolby soundtrack).  Thoughout the movie, I also notice very slight sync problems also.
In Weird Science, turn on the English subtitles and about 7m20 in, you will notice that you don't hear Gary saying, ""If there's one thing I know, it's female stats"" (again, Dolby soundtrack)!
On the positive side, I didn't notice anything wrong with Sixteen Candles and it is nice to have the original soundtrack back (the VHS changed some of the background music that was playing from the theatrical version).
None of the discs come with booklets or features that can be called special.",1062806400,2,859,4.924137931034482

1904198,5,B0000A98ZQ,"I grew up in the 80's watching the Brat Pack. And these movies are a must have for any avid movie collector, I have over 300 dvds in my collection and when I heard that this set was coming out I snatched it right up.

1904199,4,B0000A98ZQ,"Don't get me wrong:  I'm grateful to see that these three great 80's flicks directed by teen movie director extraordinare John Hughes have FINALLY been remastered in Dolby 5.1 and DTS.  And the sound is great...I watched ""Weird Science"" and could really tell the difference.  But why couldn't there by any special features on these discs?  All we get is the original trailer and some rental suggestions. Why couldn't Hughes offer commentary on these movies?  After all, he provided a really interesting one for ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  There MUST be some great stories behind the making of these movies; why won't he tell them?
Also, I know there was an E! True Hollywood Story featuring the journey behind ""Sixteen Candles.""  Why couldn't that be included?  Why not have cast biographies and filmographies at least?  That's easy enough!
Since I adore all three films and the sound remastering is incredible, I will rate this set four stars.  But not adding any special features to really separate this new box set from the lackluster original DVD versions....what a shame!",1062028800,63,1076,4.99438202247191

The only problem I saw with this set is that it is very generic in terms of what the extras are. There are no extras. When you press the bonus feature you think you are going to see something like a music video or deleted scene, all it is is a commercial  for the other movies in the collection. If you get this specific collection for the enjoyment of The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, and Weird Science you won't be dissatisfied, if you want extras also this collection is not for you.",1361232000,,593,4.342342342342342

The collection came as a mini 3-ring binder, so it was a cute presentation and it doesn't take up a lot of room.  It also had a trivia quiz in the binder regarding the 3 movies.  Perfect for an 80's movie buff.  You never could have purchased something like that in a store and she thought it was the coolest thing ever.  This was one gift she was really excited about getting.  Being an 80's movie buff myself, especially John Hughes movies, the only thing that I would have changed is instead of Weird Science I would have rather had Pretty in Pink.",1358035200,,722,4.151079136690647

1904273,3,B0000A98ZQ,"I bought this on a whim when it was on sale because I always enjoyed the John Hughes movies with Molly Ringwald. Admittedly I'd never seen Weird Science. It doesn't deserve to be in the same box as Sixteen Candles & Breakfast Club. I don't think a Sixteen Candles/Breakfast Club/Pretty in Pink combo exists, but I might be wrong. I did appreciate the way these movies were packaged so much that I went out & cut up a copy of Pretty in Pink to create my own John Hughes quadfecta.",1325894400,,479,4.333333333333333

1904278,2,B0000A98ZQ,"I must say that I wasn't satisfied. When I received my package from amazon In the mail, I was very angry. When I opened the package, what I had ordered wasn't in there. I ordered the high school flashback collection with The Breakfast Club, Wierd Science, and Sixteen Candles, but what I got wasn't what I ordered. What I received was The Breakfast Club, two of the exact same Wierd Science DVDs and Sixteen Candles wasn't in there. I got duplicate DVDs instead of all three. So I must say that I probably will never order off of Amazon.com again.",1309910400,,547,4.48
1904279,2,B0000A98ZQ,"There is nothing to complain about the packaging. The three movies come in a very durable, pseudo-high-school style mini-binder, which is very durable and also will fit in nicely on any DVD shelf. Since this is a ""collection"" I thought there would be more extra features - you know, commentary, featurettes, that kind of thing. But the extras are mainly just the theatrical trailers. So that was disappointing, but not completely devastating.

I saw Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club on TV a few times, enjoyed them, and received this collection as a gift from a friend. By the time I received this gift, I hadn't seen either movie in quite a few years. So I was excited to watch them again.

SPOILER ALERT

And I was disappointed. Sixteen Candles has the totally pointless asian exchange student (or whatever) as a character, proving that John Hughes apparently thought that depicting ""foreigners"" as gibberish speaking idiots was the height of comedy. We also have the hugely illogical ending, which is Jake Ryan falling for Molly Ringwald, a girl he never talks to, doesn't know at all, and isn't even part of the same circle of friends. It's this very strange decision he comes to that basically boils down to - ""I am deciding that I like Samantha Baker now because I found a piece of paper that said she was a virgin [titillating!] and, being a male of the dumber variety, now perceive my current girlfriend as a slut, therefore not girlfriend material, which is totally logical since she is having sex with me.""

The Breakfast Club was even more disappointing since it had a lot of potential - five students, in detention, all bond and realize that, amazingly, they all kind of like each other, and high school cliques are stupid. Unfortunately, the way they all pair off is a little baffling. First, Princess goes after Bad Boy; wow, I certainly didn't see that coming from a mile away. Wonder how long that relationship is going to last? Then, Princess gives Goth Girl a makeover (for some unexplained reason), which causes Jock to actually speak to Goth Girl, and, of course, kiss her. What a wonderful message - if you're a girl, let some prissy popular girl make you look exactly like her, and some dumb jock (with Daddy issues) will treat you like a person instead of a piece of furniture. Aw, the power of inner beauty. The Geek, of course, gets left out of all of this romantic pairing up, because everyone knows that geeks can't ever have girlfriends; geeks are also all guys. Considering their shared status as social pariahs, you'd think it would make more sense for the Geek and Goth Girl to pair up, but then poor Emilio Estevez would left out, and leaving an attractive person without a potential date is just too unrealistic, even for a teen movie.

There's not much I can say about Weird Science. The premise is ridiculous, and more than a little misogynistic. Did John Hughes just get off a bad breakup or something when he agreed to direct this? Women are either social-ladder climbing shrews (the jocks' girlfriends) or perfect goddesses (Lisa, the ""computer-generated"" woman). What makes even less sense is that after a violent standoff, where the Geeks act all manly, the girls, who previously dated the jocks, now wrap themselves around the Geeks. So...now the Geeks have girlfriends! So now Lisa has absolutely no purpose, so she conveniently leaves. Weird Science is, by far, the very worst of these three movies.

Hence the 2 star rating. Now, if you've already seen these movies, and you already like them, then I would highly recommend you purchase this. It's very cute and nostalgic. I, however, after receiving this as a gift, realized how awful all three of these movies actually are. The 80's must have been a low point in quality film with realistic, sympathetic characters that one could relate to, because John Hughes has been held up as some sort of King of the Teenage Experience, and if that's how he sees the teenage experience...well, the guy has a seriously selective memory, then.",1305072000,,4032,4.785919540229885

1904293,3,B0000A98ZQ,"This movie pack has two series flaws:

(1) It does not include St. Elmo's Fire, which is universally considered to be one of the two core Brat Pack movies. No Brat Pack movie pack is complete without St. Elmo's Fire.

(2) WTF is Wargames doing in here? Wargames isn't a Brat Pack movie! Yes, it has Ally Sheedy in it, but Matthew Broderick has never been in any other movies with any Brat Pack members, so he is not a member of the Brat Pack. And starring only one member of the Brat Pack does not make a movie a Brat Pack movie.

Basically, this movie has one core BP movie, one peripheral BP movie, and one non-BP movie. It is also worth noting that in addition to not being a Brat Pack movie, Wargames isn't even a GOOD movie, and in addition to being only a peripheral BP movie, Sixteen Candles is pretty mediocre. I have no idea whether they did this on purpose or not. Since this box basically got things about half right overall, I'm giving it 3/5. Also, Wikipedia has an excellent article on the Pack, which is worth reading.

P.S. If you want to see a good '80s movie with Matthew Broderick, then take a day off with Ferris Bueller :)",1222473600,,1143,4.277777777777778
1904294,4,B0000A98ZQ,"For me, there couldn't be a more fitting name for this set of DVDs. Watching these films was an instant flashback to those years I've so longed to forget. Although I graduated just after The Breakfast ClubSixteen Candles, and Weird Science were released, they were certainly still popular when I was in school, and watching them brought back memories- and reminded me how great these movies are.

While these teen angst cult classics will be available individually this fall as well, The High School Flashback Collection brings the three of them together for the first time, which is absolutely brilliant. Whether you host a marathon 80's movie party at your house on a Friday night (and require everyone to wear leg warmers, jelly bracelets, and parachute pants) or simply sit down with a bowl of popcorn one Sunday afternoon, you're going to enjoy three films that helped define a generation.

Writer/director John Hughes is brilliant, and these three films are the jewels in his crown. And with stars like Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Kelly LeBrock, and Emilio Estevez, how can you go wrong?

(I'm not even going to get into the synopsis ofThe Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, or Weird Science; if you haven't seen them at least half a dozen times since their release, you shouldn't be reading this, you should be watching the films!)

SPECIAL FEATURES

For the most part, the extras on these discs aren't anything to write home about. Having said that, what they lack in quantity, they almost make up for in meatiness.

The Breakfast Club includes Sincerely Yours, a 12-part documentary featuring cast and crew (although not surprisingly, Ms. Ringwald is missing...) reflecting on the making of the film, sharing stories, and talking about their lives at the time. It also includes a look at the characters and music from the film, and interviews with filmmakers (Amy Heckerling from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Diablo Cody from Juno) who talk about the cultural resonance of the film, and how it affecting them and their careers.

A second bonus feature- and one I found sociologically interesting- is called The Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack. In this featurette, cast members, journalists and film historians explore the ""Brat Pack"" label, and the impact that it had both on pop culture, and on the careers of the group's members. Audio Commentary with Anthon Michael Hall and Judd Nelson, and the original Theatrical Trailer round out the extras.

The special features on the Sixteen Candles disc are much weaker. In fact, there's only one, and it's an 11-part documentary featuring cast members who discuss their experience making the film, and what was going on in their lives at the time... is this starting to sound familiar? And yes, there's also an interview with filmmakers- the same from The Breakfast Club- who discuss the cultural resonance of this film, blah, blah, blah.

At least the special features on the Weird Science disc original. It's Alive! leads off, with a look at the making of the film, including fashion, music, character development and special effects. Next is She's Alive, the slightly scary (and not in a horror film sort of way) TV pilot episode that was based on the film. Finally, they've thrown in the Theatrical Trailer, most likely just to beef it up.",1221696000,28,3327,4.95870736086176

Re-buying these movies for one cool commentary track on just one movie is a rip off much along the lines of the ""I Love the 80's"" DVD's that were recently released.

The only way to stop studios from the ""Double Dip"" is not to purchase these product which are attempts at selling essentially the same product with ""Minor"" differences.

Would I have preferred these were on the ""High School Reunion"" releases, of course!  But hey, this is the world of DVD's.

That right age (or close) when they first came out, YOU'LL LOVE THEM.  This is one blast from the past that still stands the test of time.  If you don't laugh and/or cry during at least one of the movies, you're not human.  Of the three, Anthony Michael Hall's scene in Breakfast Club is stunning.

The music cd kinda makes up for it which is a nice unadvertised touch loved the music. I am so glad that I brought this set after all this time these movies have not lost their charm. I would like to comment on a common complaint  expressed by other reviewers the inclusion of weird science in this box set. I think it is appropriate but I think they should have called it the John Hughes collection. Since we all know the brat pack included Rob Lowe,Andrew McCarthy and Demi Moore. I look forward to purchasing the other set with Ferris Bueller,Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful.

I will end this review with a thumbs up and a pop quiz

1904311,4,B0000A98ZQ,"I think we should all just pretend that John Hughes died tragically in 1990, shortly after working on the brilliant ""Uncle Buck.""  He was not at all involved in such films as ""Baby's Day Out"" or ""Home Alone 3.""  He did, however, make several great movies in the 1980s, including ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Weird Science,"" the films enclosed in this lovely collection.

A lot of people have been very critical of the inclusion of ""Weird Science"" in this collection, but I am not one of them.  It's true that this is not really a Brat Pack movie, but it is a John Hughes '80s film, and it is great.  It's also the third movie he directed.  ""The Breakfast Club"" is the second.  ""Sixteen Candles"" is the first.  So, basically, this collection gives us the first three classics that John Hughes brought us, so I don't see the problem.

""Sixteen Candles"" (1984): This will always be my favorite of the John Hughes movies.  It's a bonafide classic of the '80s with wonderful performances from Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall.  This is my favorite because it's really funny (Long Duk Dong especially, and Anthony Michael Hall's team of geeks) but also sorta touching.  Anyone can identify with Samantha Baker's sadness, and how she doesn't really know  why she's sad, just that she is sad.  That's really quite touching, in my opinion.  There are some great scenes, like the one between Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall in the shop room, or when Molly Ringwald and her dad (Paul Dooley, recently on ""Desperate Housewives"") have a nice conversation at night in the living room.  It's scenes like this that make the movie truly great, more so than other teen movies.

""The Breakfast Club"" (1985): While not my favorite of the John Hughes films, this is also a classic and quite possibly the most famous of his work.  I'm a sophomore in high school, and I still hear people talking about this one all the time, which proves just how enduring and timeless the work of John Hughes really is.  This movie is a wonderful ensemble with great work from Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and especially Judd Nelson.  Also, Paul Gleason is the perfect jackass.  Great '80s fun with plenty of touching moments and a wonderful ending.

""Weird Science"" (1985): This is just plain wacky fun.  It's different in style from the other two films in this collection, but I love it just as much.  It's crazy and wild and out of control and it's just great.  Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan-Mitchell Smith make the perfect geeks, and Kelly LeBrock is so wonderfully sexy.  A noteable part of this movie is the incredible Oingo Boingo theme song, ""Weird Science,"" which is just about the coolest song ever.

So, what about this set?  It should be noted that the three disks in this collection are the same three disks from the previously released ""High School Reunion Collection,"" and even come with an ad for that collection.  The quality is great.  The movies are all remastered in anamorphic widescreen and look beautiful.  The cool thing is that ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Weird Science"" come with their original theatrical soundtracks and not the changed VHS soundtracks, which is really nice.

The thing that makes this collection distictive is definately the gorgeous binder package.  Looking at the above picture is not the same as really seeing it.  This is just a beautiful piece of art.  It really is a binder, with clasps and everything, and the movies enclosed in little slips on the clasps.  It's truly lovely and looks very noteable on the shelf.

This set also comes with an extra CD featuring eight great '80s songs, including ""True"" (Spandau Ballet), ""If You Leave"" (Orchestral Maneuvers In The Dark), ""Weird Science"" (Oingo Boingo), ""Oh Yeah"" (Yello),"" and ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" (Simple Minds).  This set is definately worth buying for this CD.  I listen to it all the time.  I love these songs, so much, and each one is good, although my favorite is by far ""If You Leave,"" followed closely by ""Weird Science.""  Trust me, if you get this set, you'll find yourself listening to this CD all the time.  It's just great.

So, the only thing that this set lacks is special features.  I for one was very dissapointed to see that none of the deleted scenes from the TV versions of the film made it here.  All three have some footage that can only be seen on TV, but Universal was not generous enough to bestow it upon us, which is a shame.  Basically, there's nothing here in the way of special features, except for trailers on ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Weird Science.""  So, if you're into special feautres, you'll be severely dissapointed.

However, aside from that, this set is great.  All three movies are '80s classics, and they're presented with their original soundtracks, in a lovely special case, with a wonderful music disk.  How can you say no?  Recommended.",1138492800,19,4918,4.767772511848341
1904312,4,B0000A98ZQ,"This is a great set, although the extras are lacking and it would have been perfect if Some Kind of Wonderful was included as well. But the CD is a real catch for all the 80's nuts like me. Cheers.",1135296000,,197,3.95
1904313,4,B0000A98ZQ,"First off, these are the same editions as found in THE HIGH SCHOOL REUNION COLLECTION set of DVDs.  If you own those - no need to double dip.  The transfers are the same, no extras, and yes... these are only the Universal owned ""Brat Pack"" movies.  Nothing has been changed to the three movies proper.  Original soundtracks are here for SIXTEEN CANDLES and WEIRD SCIENCE (tv versions often replace many of the songs, as did the VHS copies).  All of them are in enhanced widescreen with 5.1 sound mixes.

The packaging is indeed a very cool little 3-ring binder.  It includes an 8 song CD with the following songs:

""True"" Spandau Ballet

""Tenderness"" - General Public

""If You Leave"" -OMD

""Weird Science"" Oingo Boingo

""Oh Yeah"" Yello

""Pretty in Pink"" - The Psychedelic Furs (the soundtrack version not original recording)

""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" - Simple Minds

""I Go Crazy"" - Flesh for Lulu

If you bought them the first time around I would suggest just heading over to iTunes or a similar service and downloading the 8 songs for less than $8.  If you didn't buy the set the first time then it's a neat repackage, and will be a fun item for collectors and fans.  I do like the packaging a lot, but it is bigger than your average DVD case - so it won't fit easily in a holder if you have one that conforms to the standard release size.

The films are GREAT!  SIXTEEN CANDLES, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, and WEIRD SCIENCE are all fun even after two decades.  They don't make teen movies like this anymore, and all three films are like totally awesome.  I can't see anyone having a problem with what's here.  Sure, it's not the ENTIRE ""Brat Pack"", but it's most of them.  Besides you can always buy more inserts for the binder and add the ones you want to the collection.",1131321600,7,1772,4.465625

Weird Science deals with two boys who are un-popular dorks who are so desperated for a woman that they have to create one with their computer once they did she turn their life around by throwing them a party in the end they had girlfriends of their own.

Sixteen Candles has a bunch of teenagers thats been having a house party and trashing the house, it's a sweet sixteen birthday for the girl named Samantha. Molly Ringwald became a teen queen cause of this movie.

The Breakfast Club, another big movie that Molly Ringwald played in. Five teenagers spend their Saturday day detention at their high school.

If you stop the movie and decide you want to watch it later, you will be stuck watching the same long trailer again and again.  What is this wonderful trailer you ask?

The image quality is very good, although all three movies lack any extras other than theatrical trailers. I would have enjoyed seeing a ""Making Of"" feature, or commentary from the stars of these films.
While all three movies are enjoyable, I think that Pretty in Pink would have been a better fit with The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles than Weird Science is. That movie is a different style and genre that just doesn't seem to fit perfectly with the others.
