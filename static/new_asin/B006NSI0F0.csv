8501467,5,B006NSI0F0,This very was very well thought and professionally produced. The Chameleon Club story is well documented from its roots to modern day updates. There are a bunch of guys in the film that I remember seeing and hearing about back in the day when I used to go there in high school. Definitely a great piece of music history as well as Lancaster PA history can be learned and enjoyed by watching this documentary !,1390953600,,409,4.466666666666667
8501468,5,B006NSI0F0,"For anyone who grew up in Lancaster in the 1990s, this is the documentary for you.  Lots of footage and artifacts from local bands of the time, great interviews with Chameleon owners and employees, and a kickass soundtrack.",1353628800,,223,4.868421052631579
8501469,4,B006NSI0F0,"I grew up a little sheltered outside of Lancaster City, and I may have missed the heyday of the Chameleon. However, I still attended many concerts in the '00s, and I used to hang out in the Lizard Lounge regularly. I dig learning the history of a scene, finding out what specific places were before I find myself there, and this film gets into that for sure. Not every story or time period detailed may be as intriguing, but my wife and I both found the documentary very interesting and VERY well put-together. Be sure to check out all the bonus features, like the BBC Records ads--truly time capsule material from a happening Lancaster scene I was too young to experience.

Did I mention just how well-crafted the overall film is? Great job!",1351641600,2,742,4.578947368421052
8501470,4,B006NSI0F0,I thought this documentary showed a lot of history about a club and what it takes to begin a business like that.  It had a pretty detailed account of some of the problems that come up and the spirit to begin such a venture.  I found it fun to watch and a great portrayal of a city that seems to only get credit for it's amish population.  Definitely worth checking out!,1337558400,3,369,4.169014084507042
