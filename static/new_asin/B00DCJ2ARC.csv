5789162,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"Out of curiosity, before I see a film here, I read the 1-star reviews and some of the 4 and 5 stars.
In The Fog, I can assure you, is not for people who think a good movie is measured by nonstop action and
fast dialogue-think The Expendables 2-thus the 1-star reviews by people after seeing In the Fog.
Perhaps these are the same people who drive theater ticket sales for action blockbusters and force Hollywood to keep making bad movies. I don't know.

All I can say is,  the one who gave this one a bad review have severe ADHD and wouldn't know greatness in film.

And greatness it is.

It attempts to turn a mirror onto the  savagery of  German occupied Bellorussia during WW 2, but the Germans are rarely seen.
The people are who are on trial here: who collaborates, who fights as partisans, etc. These people know they will be judged by history.
Th  tension builds. Th  emotions run high.
The movie would seem to move slow to the uneducated. But one with an eye for human drama knows that real life drags on at the same pace.
The cinematography is good as well. Most of the film is shot in the forest.

The story is of one good man's efforts to die honorably for the sake of his family and hi  name. Falsely accused by the partisan fighters-whom he'd known since childhood- of collaboration with the Germans, he is taken from his home and ordered to be shot.
But things go wrong for his executioners, and he is able to relate his story and gain a temporary reprieve.
His discussions with the partisans deals with th  mood and psychology of a people in wartime and the choices they make under duress.

I cannot write a professional review. All I can say is that this is a good example of how the Russians have mastered the art of film.
Movie lovers with an appreciation of finer films will agree.
But if Jean Claude van Damme or Stallone action thrillers are closer to your taste, move along. This isn't for you, and you'll only get bored and write bad reviews about a film you didn't even understand.",1391817600,5,2005,4.389189189189189
5789163,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"That's how I felt the main character is going when I watched this movie.  Granted that it is a slow movie as others have reviewed, but I find the slowness add to the storyline.  I wonder what is going on in the minds of the people in the movie as each scene opens up.  This is not a movie that would leave you happy and content at the end.  It does ask you difficult questions about the fairness of life in general.  If you have any friends or family who are suffering through depression, when they feel that there is no hope left, this movie will convey those feelings.

This movie is not for anyone wanting a fast action movie, but if you are a philosopher or someone researching on the theme of death, despair, kindness; you will find all of those theme here.",1391212800,,762,4.256944444444445
5789164,4,B00DCJ2ARC,understated character study. a piece on how war affects people in different ways. all struggling to survive with different characters making different choices from nearly the same circumstances. a fine reflection on the way people and morals break down from the stress of war. somber in tone and character. excellent acting. you feel like you're in Belorussia in 42. peter rinaldi natchez ms,1391212800,4,391,5.222222222222222
5789165,1,B00DCJ2ARC,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.  The movie is way too slow.  I mean they have stills of peoples' faces for 30 seconds at a time.  They also show a bird still for about 20 seconds.  Both of those are pointless to the story.  Also there seems to be no plot until 3/4 into the movie, which leaves the viewer struggling to know what the movie is about up until then.  There is also no comic relief.
Overall, it is a painful movie to watch because you wonder what the point of the movie is.  I wouldn't watch this movie ever again, even if it was the only movie on Earth.",1390953600,,604,3.9421487603305785
5789166,4,B00DCJ2ARC,The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow but give it time. It captures the brutality of life in German occupied Russia during World War 2. It's certainly not an action film like Saving Private Ryan.,1390521600,,201,4.611111111111111
5789167,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"This movie moves a bit slow in the beginning, but stay with it and you won't be disappointed. A bit low brow but the drama is subtle and the action will come!",1389139200,,158,3.96875

Horrrribly SSSsssLoooowwwwwww.

I could only take one hour of this film and felt like I would die of old age if I continued.

For SOME REASON, the director has EVERYTHING strung out SOOOOOoooo  SSssssLOOoooowwwww that you can count the timed pauses. You can see the actors stare, or not move, or deliver a line, and then count to 5 or 8 or 10 seconds.

In one scene two guys just stare at each other wordlessly for 35 seconds and don't even move.

They don't even walk right: they plod slowly, they trudge, they barely motivate---it's bizarre! WHAT could have been in the director's mind?

I DO NOT RECOMMEND WASTING ANY TIME ON THIS ONE.

Miss it  :(

Skip it  :(

Do NOT WASTE YOUR BRAIN ON THIS ONE! :(

5789170,2,B00DCJ2ARC,What more is there to say?  Well it appears there is a minimum number of words required for a review so I will say it again. This movie was very slow and had a stupid ending. Save yourself two hours of boredom and watch something else.,1387411200,,235,4.108695652173913
5789171,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"If you have patience for a slowly evolving story which doesn't show the ""big picture"" of war, but reveals  intense personal disaster, ""In the Fog"" may be one which you'll appreciate.
Set in Belorussia during the early years of the war, it lacks ""action""; it plods unrelentingly;  and it would not have a large contemporary audience. Sounds of the forest replace a musical score; the actors---because they are unfamiliar to us---look like real people.

It's available on Amazon Prime streaming---free, if you subscribe to that service and have a device or TV set which allows you to stream films.

I found that its brooding shots became more engrossing as the 2 hours progressed. (I watched it in two sittings)",1386633600,3,709,4.932773109243698

5789174,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"Film making at its peak! Forget about those reviewers who gave poor rating, this movie is the product of a very talented man. The movie is good not only for cinematographic qualities (directing, photography, acting) which is the main reason why we watch movie indeed, but also for its depth and honest analysis of human condition. In this respect the movie is a russian artistic product at its best combining the visual qualities of a tarkovsky with the intellectual magnitude of  Dostoevsky. A must see for everyone who thinks cinema is not just about entertainment.",1385596800,9,567,4.968421052631579

5789176,4,B00DCJ2ARC,This is a thought provoking movie which takes place during WW2. NOT your everyday war movie in the least. If you have the patience then watch. You may not be satisfied in the end either. I found it to be very good.,1383696000,4,214,4.119047619047619

8591846,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"I am addicted to Russian cinematic portrayals of the ""Great Patriotic War"".  Happily, they have abandoned the propaganda of the Soviet-era, and now deal with the truly heart-rending barbarity that was inflicted by both sides upon the innocent occupants of the occupied areas of Belorus, the Ukraine and Russia during the post-Barborossa invasion. The acting and story line are faultless.",1416614400,,387,5.45
8591847,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"In order to see this movie, the viewer must love foreign movies - that means reading subtitles.  This is drama, set in a small village in Russia during WWII.  As many have said many times ""at the time of war, rules of law does not apply"". So how does morality apply in the circumstances that defy all humanity, compassion and decency?  This film explores three different characters set in a situations where revenge against one of them is supposed to take place for supposedly betraying three other men who sabotaged German controlled railroad.  Sushenya, local man and one of the railroad workers knew the saboteurs, but chose not to participate in derailing the train tracks.  Even a high ranking German officer can see that Sushenya is decent man and offers him to become local collaborator, which Sushenya declines.  That puts him in a situation where is no not trusted (nor protected) by anyone - Germans or the local villagers.  Sushenya is a dead man, not trusted by anyone and yet deeply moral and decent man.

During the course of the movie, we see three main characters put into situations that put their lives in jeopardy and shows their true nature.  By the same token, each one of them goes through the flashbacks of memories that show how they became who they are and how they are dealing with their current circumastances.  There are local people, who have to deal with German occupiers, local residents who collaborate with Germans and represent occupational police and partisans (i.e. communists) who are fighting against the Germans and their collaborators. This is deeply moving drama about the human nature in extreme circumstances.  It is meditation about the good and evil, right and wrong and exploration if the two can coexist at the time of war.  How much is human being willing to sacrifice in order to do the right thing or what will any human being do simply to survive?

I was so touched by this film, because it is so true to the events and circumstances that people (civilians) experienced during WWII.  I could not shake off this movie out of my head for a long time.  For reviewers who claim that movie was ""too slow"" all I have to say is that they were not paying any attention to subtle scenes that were taking place every minute of the movie.  In short, I will not hesitate to say that those reviewers are ignorant air heads who should not have watched let alone reviewed this movie at all.

And I must admit that I loved the actors. Especially the ones in the lead roles.  But main accolades go to director who is probably one and only movie director who not once showed death as it was taking place in some of the scenes.  We only saw the aftermath.  And at the end not even that.  Because at time of war, everything is fog.  Only each individual  knows their true nature of character and conduct, no matter how it may be interpreted or viewed by others.",1414454400,4,2892,4.616438356164384
8591848,5,B00DCJ2ARC,Very unique story of the German occupation days.  Very well presented.,1406764800,,70,5.363636363636363
8591849,5,B00DCJ2ARC,"A gripping story that unfolds very slowly, but delves into the human society and psyche under extreme conditions.  There is no right or wrong here except for the obvious evil in the brutality of the German occupation.  A good, innocent man is thrust into an impossible situation in which he is hated by his own society to such an extent that his life becomes just as worthless to him as it is to the his German captors.

Although the subject matter is grim, the presentation is deliberate and plodding with implied rather than graphic violence.

Well worth watching.",1406419200,,566,4.744897959183674
8591850,2,B00DCJ2ARC,"The story has some historical value, an illustration not only of German cruelty -- nothing new there -- but of how little value the Russians themselves (actually, Byelorussians  in this case) place on human life and how ready they seemed to be to accept suffering and death.

But what a downer! Slow moving, not much of a plot. No heroes. Even the villains are mostly just weak and stupid. This movie is a picture of lives that seem not to have been worth living even before the Germans came. A lot of Russian literature is like that -- a saga of suffering with little or no redeeming virtue. In this case the protagonist does refuse to collaborate, but his refusal comes across more as dumb stubborness than heroism.",1405987200,,717,4.59375
