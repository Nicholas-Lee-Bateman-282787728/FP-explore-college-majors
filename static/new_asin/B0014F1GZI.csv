3952061,5,B0014F1GZI,My two kids just adore The Jumpitz.  There music is catchy - not monotoneous.  The train one is fun to watch with your kids.,1203897600,3,124,4.125
3952062,5,B0014F1GZI,I'm glad to see this video being carried by Amazon.  It is an amazing video that young children love to sing and dance too.  Your kids will want to watch it over and over again and will be singing the songs everywhere they go.  Don't be surprised if they want to watch it right when they wake up in the morning.  We found that even older children and adults could not stop singing the songs once they heard them a couple of times!  You'll love it!  There is another title coming out in March!,1203638400,2,492,4.180851063829787

8373725,5,B0014F1GZI,So hard to find quality educational videos that teach your children more than one language. Where can I find more?,1263254400,,114,4.75
8373726,5,B0014F1GZI,"WOW!  What a great new show!  Perfect for kids 2-7yrs old. I love the music.  I wouldn't admit it to anyone, but sometimes I find myself singing them in the car by myself!!  YIKES!  Your kids will LOVE it, and you won't be dreading it like other video you have to suffer through!  Hope to see lots more of The Jumpitz!",1227657600,,318,4.131147540983607
8373727,5,B0014F1GZI,"My 2 year old daughter LOVES this dvd.  The music and dancing is great, and she gets totally involved with it.  A great video when you need that few minutes to distract them or help them unwind.  Highly recommend it.",1220572800,2,216,4.35
8373728,1,B0014F1GZI,"I asked for the spanish version, was sent the english version. The music was catchy for my grandchildren, but that was the extent of it.",1218067200,,136,4.48
8373729,5,B0014F1GZI,"WOW! These guys have so much energy! My children CAN'T STOP WATCHING!!! I'm so glad someone finally made something like this in Spanish. There are so many children's shows out there, but NONE with REAL PEOPLE who actually speak SPANISH. I'm a mother of two, and I've searched! Their songs are GREAT, I already know several of them by heart and we just received our copy! I RECCOMEND their DVDS and THANK THEM FOR QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT!!! -Mrs. Powell",1206230400,,450,4.782051282051282

8373732,5,B0014F1GZI,"If you're a parent looking for a movie to put on for your kids, I'd recommend any of the DVDs in the Jumpitz series. They were written and shot to make your child feel like part of the action! And this DVD was filmed with actors who speak and sing in Spanish, not dubbed like some other kids tv shows.",1204588800,,301,4.033333333333333
