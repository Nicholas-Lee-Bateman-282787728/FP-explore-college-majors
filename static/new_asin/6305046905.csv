951013,5,6305046905,"This is probably one of the simplest and sweetest love stories I have ever seen.  This woman loved a man whom she was forbidden to love, had his child and then by accident fell in love with another man.  She made the ultimate  sacrifice by giving her child to the Man who hated her family the most.  The ending was just wondeful.

951015,4,6305046905,"This is a powerful tale of a love that emerged during a difficult time in history, and in a place where trouble and conflict were a way of life.
Kurt Russell leaves his small surburban home town when his clock  making career fails during the depression, in search of a new start.  His  car breaks down on a lonely, mountain road where he meets Kelly Mc Gillis,  who offers him shelter in her back-woods cabin for the night.
He soon  learns of her complicated, forbidden relationship with a man who is from a  rival family clan, and becomes involved in protecting her from him and his  family.
With his clock making skill, Russell's character is able to  bring hope to the town by restoring the clock in the church steeple.  The  restoration of the clock, like the relationship that develops between the  Russell and Mc Gillis characters, bring light to an otherwise dark world  with little hope.
It is a simple and powerful story of changing the  destiny of lives in rural America.  It seemed to go unnoticed, but is a  favorite of many of my own friends.",913161600,22,1055,4.537234042553192

I think that's why it reminds me of the really good movies of the '40s and '50s.

Mountain folk, mountain morals, mountain laws, a mountain woman single mother (Kelly McGillis) and a city man watchmaker widower (Kurt Russell) are the elements of this heartbreaking and heartwarming romance.

This is a very slow paced movie, so you have to be in the mood, but don't try to find out more about it than I have told you so you can experience it completely. Pick a rainy day when you can turn off all distractions and immerse yourself into this tale of Americana. You will feel like youv'e found a secret treasure.",1215820800,11,653,4.581196581196581

I have always remembered it as being a very good family film with quality acting.  I have been looking for it and finally found it here.  Kurt is great in anything... you can really tell that he acts for the enjoyment of it and that carries over in everything he does.  Wonderful supporting cast and Phenomenal work by McGillis.

951497,5,6305046905,"Based on a novel written by one of many talented, North Carolina writers, this is a wonderful adaptation. Part of the movie was filmed in Avery County, not all that far from where I live...beautiful country. It is the heartbreaking story of a young love that can't be embraced because of an old family fued. When Kurt Russel enters the area, he finds himself falling in love with a woman who must keep the father of her illegitimate child a secret, and this secret turns out to be dangerous after an accidental death. You'll want to watch it more than once to fully take in the beautiful scenery.

I loved this movie... It seems to me I have never seen Kelly McGillis in a better movie than this one... but I never saw it being shown in any movie house, and never found it for rent or sale... Today, maybe 15 years after I saw the movie, I remembered the title of the film and decided to look it up on Amazon to see if I can buy it... and I found it, at last!  (of course I am going to buy it.)  This is truly a beautiful movie.  I can't understand how it was never shown in movie houses near me.

951499,4,6305046905,"A period story set in the North Carolina hills in what appears to be a place right smack dab in the middle of the Hatfields and McCoys--this time Wrights and Campbells.  A shy sensitive widowed clock maker, Wayland Jackson, played by Kurt Russell on his way through the mountains with his only daughter becomes stuck in a creek and ends up sticking around for longer than he bargained.  There he meets the elusive Collie Wright (Kelly McGillis's character) who with her only son seems to be living alone off from the small town.  Immediately you sense a spark between the two but as the story progresses you realize there is a dark looming secret which threatens both lives.  It appears Ellie's family has an ancient hatred that runs deep for their neighbors and would shootem' just as look at'em.  Enter dark loomy character which is the babe's father and he's from the other side of the mountain.  He is the exact opposite of our shy clock maker and Ellie knows this.  Perhaps when some see the performances as cheesy or over acted they've never actually met any mountain folk, and thusly are insistent that the histrionics are over played.  If you have been to the mountains and can feel the spirit of them then I think you will love this picture.  It is about the give and take, the act of forgiveness and of course true love.",1041897600,39,1330,4.578059071729958

951501,4,6305046905,I really enjoyed this movie.  Its setting in the mountains during the early 30's was quite entertaining.  It's sort of like a 20th century version of red badge of courage.  I would recommend it.,1001030400,9,194,4.647058823529412
951502,5,6305046905,"John Ehle is an excellent regional writer and ""Winter People"" is probably the best of his works.  The movie adaptation holds true to the book and for the critical viewer tired of cliques, car chases, and shallow characters, this film is a rare luxury. There are no stock characters in this film. And the storyline is different ... holding you tight to your armchair to the very end.  The acting is tremendous: Kurt Russell is finally challenged to a multi-part role befitting his talented depths.  The symbolic uses of the clock and the bear-killing rite are intriguing elements in the film.  ""Winter People"" is an under-rated film.",993513600,23,632,4.878504672897196
951503,3,6305046905,"Winter People really isn't a three-star movie, but a movie with a one-star  first half and a five-star second half. I doubt if many renters would have  the patience to stick with this movie all the way through, but if they do,  they will be rewarded. Everything at the beginning seems wrong: The  characters' actions seem inexplicable (i.e. Kurt Russell stopping his truck  in the middle of a creek); Russell acts and sounds like he flunked out of  the Famous Announcers' School; Kelly McGillis acts and sounds like sixth  runner-up in the Elly May Clampett impression contest; all the other actors  also seem off-kilter, especially Don Michael Paul, giving one of the  weirdest and most histrionic performances in cinematic history as McGillis'  kid brother. But then, about halfway through, the father of McGillis' baby  returns for a duel to the death with Russell. The fight itself is quite  exciting, but even more, the movie actually gets good afterward. The  dialogue suddenly takes on weight and believability, as do all the  performances (except for Mr. Paul's); McGillis is particularly moving in  her big emotional scenes. This is a great movie for connoisseurs of  cinematic schizophrenia, or merely for viewers who have the patience to  wait for the good stuff to come along!",965088000,11,1288,5.028436018957346
951504,4,6305046905,I saw this movie when I was in highschool  and loved it. I have been looking for it since then and just found it on ebay. I recommend looking at all the auction sites for this movie. Its worth buying!,959817600,2,200,4.0
951505,5,6305046905,This is a wonderful movie; too bad it did not get the credit it deserves. It is rare that a movie is as good as the book (I read the book and saw the movie)but this one comes close. The story is interesting and fast paced.  THe strength of family and the power of love keep viewers eager to see how  this tale is resolved. The scenery is great; even now it is possible to  visit the set in rural NC. There are so many junky movies these days but  this one is worth seeing - and worth purchasing. Please let me know if it  is re-released. thanx,954633600,6,543,3.990740740740741
7880995,5,6305046905,"My husband and I just watched this movie. It is hard for us to find a movie we both would enjoy. However, this movie was great in both our opinions! Men will love it for the conflict and suspense. Hopeless romantics like me will love it for the love story tucked in there along with the other strong relationships. We both give this movie five stars!",1516233600,,350,4.318181818181818
