3035762,5,B000YV1KX6,"I ordered this CD because I have osteroarthritis and my doctor recommended it. I am very satisfied with the exercises displayed. It will be awhile before I know if there are results but, it brings my heart rate up and I feel much better. I don't have other tapes to compare it to since I've never had other tapes before. I am 65 yrs old and feel the exercise CD's shown on TV would be way too hard for me. This tape would be valuable exercise for any age.",1358467200,2,455,4.123595505617978
3035763,4,B000YV1KX6,"This video is medium-paced with good instruction. It keeps you moving the entire time. It is a good impact routine to help strengthen bones. Highly recommend purchasing this video. Heart rate was accelerated nicely, but not too much that I wasn't able to keep up with the routine. Very nicely done video.",1330128000,3,304,4.865384615384615
3035764,5,B000YV1KX6,"This DVD is excellent if you want to try to prevent osteoporosis. I had read about Miriam Nelson and had even gone to the public library years ago to check out her book. I photocopied some exercises that I started doing with weights as I was diagnosed with osteopenia. Then recently I found that she had a DVD out on preventing osteoporosis. I ordered it and started doing my weight exercises with it. I even have my husband doing them with me as he has been diagnosed with osteoporosis. When we recently went to the doctor for our yearly bone density test, we were pleased to find out that it had improved. I was even able to go off of Boniva as a result of daily walking, proper diet and weight bearing exercises. I highly recommend this DVD.",1312588800,12,744,4.398550724637682
3035765,2,B000YV1KX6,"I agree with the person who said she thought it would be an exercise program along the lines of Miriam Nelson's book - I thought so, too, but it is not the case.  This may be a good exercise program for some but not for me.  The first part is an aerobic warmup which includes a lot of jumping.  The middle part is a workout with weights but includes a good number of lunges.  As I already have bone issues and knee problems, I do not want to jump nor do lunges.  The final section is some stretching and balance exercises.  I will not be using this DVD.  I thought this would be a good sometimes-alternative to a DVD I already use consistently, ""Skeletal Fitness"" by Mirabai Holland.  I will stick with Mirabai's program which is EXCELLENT and covers all areas prone to fracture.  I know with Mirabai's program that I am working to strengthen my bones but in a gentler, yet very effective way which uses weights, resistance and isometrics.",1233532800,56,939,4.444444444444445

This was not what I had expect after having viewed the Strong Women Web site. I expected it to be more along the lines of the books weight lifting exercises, never the less the information is very good, exercise program excellent for beginners and does use weights, the program takes very little time out of your day and you feel you have achieved something when finished.",1232582400,24,608,6.708860759493671
