8319053,4,B001LNOLOQ,"[THE WAILING aka MURDER OBSESSION aka MURDER SYNDROME - (1981) - Fullscreen presentation - Directed by Ricardo Freda] As is typical with a fair share of Sinister Cinema's releases, the picture presented here suffers from a severe indoor dark contrast, bland and washed out outdoor colors and noticeable lack of sharpness, so adjustments to your TV are necessary to enjoy this one properly. It has all the subtle qualities of a 70's drive-in flick. Is it worth the effort? Probably, as this film has never been distributed in NTSC format prior to this edition, so adjust your video and expectations accordingly. After all, it stars Anita Strindberg and Laura Gemser and is the last giallo film directed by Freda, need I say more?

Michael (Stefano Patrizi), the son of an orchestra conductor, returns home after many years to see his ailing mother Glenda (Anita Strindberg as mom? I'd have never left home...). He's now directing films (and has luscious Laura Gemser sexually assaulted in the first five minutes of this film in one of his own films) and was accused of killing his father when he was a child - more on that later. He's brought along his girlfriend, Debra (Silvia Dionisio), but tells his doting mother she's his secretary. Controlling, much?

The next day the actors arrive at the estate (so there's a cast to kill off), and we learn Michael's schtupping Laura Gemser too, so we get to see her in all her lascivious glory before she's abruptly done in (sniff). Next goes the assistant director, a hatchet through the skull. Then Maria, another cast member, takes his camera to the attic dark room, develops the film and is shocked by what she uncovers before she takes a chainsaw blade to the throat and is decapitated. Good times, indeed.

Meanwhile Mom is as wacky and controlling as ever, holding a pokerhand of secrets we've yet to see played. All evidence is directed at Michael, but then again, there's the family servant, Oliver, who's been secretly in love with mommy for decades. There's an undercurrent of Satanism, black magic and incest at the core of this cesspool, and the finale features a great sacrilegious depiction of 'The Pieta' that will stay with you long after the end credits have subsided, leaving most with a snide smile at the inevitable if not somewhat predictable outcome. A decent film for the end of the gaillo era for fans (though something tells me it's been edited here and there) that's marred by the print utilized here. Considering it's the only game in town, print-wise, aficionados and completists should check it out, but spare us from 'The Wailing' if you're unhappy 'bout the print - you've been dutifully forewarned.",1312416000,2,2674,4.859649122807017
