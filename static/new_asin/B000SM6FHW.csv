2887514,4,B000SM6FHW,I like this walking DVD. It keeps me engaged at all times in a short period of time. I truly feel like I've worked out.,1359244800,,119,3.8

2887516,5,B000SM6FHW,I do this dvd 5 times a week. Its fun takes 25 minutes to do so anyone can find time to do it.,1349481600,,94,3.130434782608696
2887517,5,B000SM6FHW,"Love it! Am using it to get back in to shape. Flies by so fast, you don't realize how much fun you're having.",1347148800,4,109,3.782608695652174
2887518,4,B000SM6FHW,"Debbie and two other cast members are in this video. It's shot outside in lovely scenery. It starts off far more vigorously than Leslie's (Leslie Sansone) warm-ups. The steps are high and both arms are swinging. There actually is no warm-up in the way we're used to if we workout with Leslie.

The music is great and the beat good. In some spots the music is actually a bit too loud. It drowns out her voice somewhat.

Debbie is quit motivational without being chatty. She's more like a coach than a friend. I find that refreshing.

The  intensity goes up in about 4 minutes. You go into a light jog - but she shows modification. Then she goes into marching. This is true interval work -- the type we're told really burns calories. Doing Leslie's workouts doesn't move my pedometer much. But this one did. I got a total of 2609 steps, which is slightly under 1 mile. I'm sure that is low because of the lateral movements, among other things.

If you're not losing weight with Leslie, I'm pretty sure you will with Debbie. But I warn you, this is a dynamic workout -- very high energy and lots of leg movement. There is also upper body movement. No equipment is needed.

As she says, ""We are all athletes, in training, for life."" And you'll feel like an athlete when you do her workout. Unlike Leslie, you won't know how far you've ""walked"" -- but you'll know you had one rugged workout.

I found the video more marching and jogging than walking and it's far different from Leslie's workouts. If you're used to Leslie's workouts, you'll find this one a bit rough. There's bouncing around and some people might find that a bit too hard if they're not used to it. Others will love it. You might want to put your jog bra on. Well, if you're a woman.

At a bit over 19 minutes, she starts the cool-down. She brings the heart rate down a little at a time. It is a very efficient workout and there is no way it won't burn lots of calories --- even if you have to modify.

At about 22 minutes, she takes you into some stretching and the music gets somewhat lower and slower. This lasts about 3 minutes. The workout runs a total of 23.30 minutes. I feel the cool-down should be longer, considering the intensity of the workout. It's quite short with just a few stretches. A few more minutes would be a good idea. But, you can do that on your own.

There's also an audio CD for you to take on your outside walks.

If you want a high intensity, calorie-burning, well planned and well executed workout, I highly recommend you give this a go. Be sure and watch it first so you can see if there are some areas you might want to modify. One of the cast does the modifications so those who can't get on with the intensity of Debbie can follow the modifier.

I don't know why Debbie has only done two or three videos. I wish she did more. But, if you're a Leslie fan, you'll find this a pleasant change of pace once a week or so. It's far more high energy than Leslie's workouts. You'll find when you get through this one, you can tackle an additional mile of Leslie easily.

2887519,5,B000SM6FHW,"I bought this based on the reviews I read here. I'm not disappointed. This is easy for me but I still feel like I've accomplished something. Not like some videos, where you get about half way through and then it's too hard because you really are a beginner. I would recommend this for anyone who likes to walk but especially if you like to exercise in the privacy of your own home.",1245715200,5,381,4.305555555555555
2887520,4,B000SM6FHW,"What I really like about this DVD is that it's not discouraging to someone who is a beginner or someone getting back into running after having a baby or just being away from running for a while.  There are three people in the video all working at different levels so you can keep up with whomever you're most comfortable.  There are no difficult aerobics moves that are hard to follow and you can go at your own pace.  (I almost always ""jog"" more than they jog on the video and ""run"" more than they run to boost my own workout level a little bit.)  Debbie Rocker, who is the trainer in this DVD, is far less annoying than Leslie Sansone (a well-known trainer who does a lot of walking videos).  Bless Leslie's heart... She means well, but she's pretty annoying. My advice is to use this DVD as a guide and cater it to your own needs.  Personally, I think it's worth owning.",1217462400,13,873,4.325153374233129

2887522,1,B000SM6FHW,"I was very disappointed by this walking video.  Really, Debbie pretty much just power walks thru most of the whole routine.  I was looking for another walking DVD with more variety in moves, and this did NOT fit the bill.  We fast forwarded thru much of it to see if she did any different moves, and didn't find much.  Sorry I bought this...",1403827200,,341,4.365079365079365
2887523,4,B000SM6FHW,I normally us Leslie Sansone exercise DVD's. I like Debbie for an added boost & change. I use the 30 min. It is a good 30 mins!,1397347200,,127,3.740740740740741
2887524,5,B000SM6FHW,Liked it...Debbie is very easy to follow. Does get your heart rate up. Would recommend to anyone to use daily.,1391472000,,110,4.55
2887525,4,B000SM6FHW,"I am a Leslie sansone fan.  Picked up this DVD for a change of pace.  It's a pretty good workout.  More intense than most of Leslie's videos, but not as many moves.  Debbie has the same ""constant chatter"" style as Leslie.  I didn't find the background distracting as some said.  I just wish there was more variety in moves",1382400000,,322,4.372881355932203
2887526,4,B000SM6FHW,Not disappointed at all and well worth the money I paid for it. The workout is great for the morning as it starts off very gradually.,1382313600,2,133,4.153846153846154
2887527,5,B000SM6FHW,"I like I had a trainer coaching me along. Appreciated the modification so I could switch gears when needed. Enjoyed the music, the scenery, and the pace. I have incorporated the DVD into my workout rotation.",1374364800,,207,4.777777777777778
2887528,2,B000SM6FHW,It is supposed to be a 30' workout but it is actually 20' The whole workout is only marching at the different speeds with only a couple of variations. It was really boring.,1371254400,,172,4.242424242424242
2887529,5,B000SM6FHW,This DVD takes about 1/2 hour to work up to a good brisk walking pace.  The ladies demonstrate low impact as well as regular walking variations.,1362614400,,144,4.538461538461538
2887530,5,B000SM6FHW,On the days I don't have as much time I can put this in and still feel like I got a good work out.,1360972800,,98,3.125

8205945,5,B000SM6FHW,"More challenging than AM and PM Walking but less so than the Walking for Weight Loss DVD.  I'm always inspired by the woman on her right, who makes everything look like a dance move.  This program has none of the terrible lunges that are so hard on the knees, which makes it one of my favorites.  I don't know how Debbie always seems to know exactly when to remind me to stand straight and pull in my abs, but she does.",1461110400,,419,4.148148148148148

8205949,5,B000SM6FHW,Debbie Rocker is a pleasant walking partner.  Nothing tricky or too strenuous here.  One walker shows the low impact version at all times.,1419724800,,138,4.956521739130435

8205953,5,B000SM6FHW,"I started working out with Debbie's video am/pm walking, and felt great. This is why I decided to purchase her other videos, and they are excellent. Great way to start your mornings, and since I have all the videos, there is a lot of variety in the workouts, even though they are based on walking (marching is more like it, but very good indeed). My energy is higher, my posture is better, I sleep much better now.",1410652800,2,414,4.3896103896103895
