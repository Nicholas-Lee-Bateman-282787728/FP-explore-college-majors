4133927,1,B003KO1JQ2,Awful film and I usually like cheap films from this era. Michael Ontkean looked sexy though.,1420156800,,92,4.8125
4133928,2,B003KO1JQ2,"Two young girls, Karen (Dianna Hull) and Debbie (Kathleen Cody), hit the wide-open road in search of kicks, ignoring the fact that a serial killer is murdering young women along the beach of California's Big Sur. They rent a car, drive recklessly (a cop gives Karen a ticket for throwing her bra out the window) and screw with the heads of a series of hitch-hikers (including two gay guys), nearly hitting one guy on the side of the road. These girls are nothing but two spoiled brats who only care about themselves. Also on the road hitch-hiking is recently-released manic depressive Army soldier Will (Michael Ontkean), who we see in the beginning of the film beating up two guys playing pool in a bar for no reason at all, after having a flashback (which he has frequently) with his Army psychiatrist (who releases Will after telling him that the Army has done all they can). Will may also be the serial killer on the loose. Karen and Debbie pick up Will and he brings them to the Institute For Human Potential, a hippie encounter group run by Will's old friend John (Ralph Waite). John tells Will to ditch the Army uniform (""It's a false identity."") if he wants to stay at the Institute. Karen and Debbie catch the eye of The Maker (John McMurtry), a creepy Institute teacher and old Army buddy of Will's. The trio then go to Debbie's parents' beach house, where a bunch of hippies are squatting. One of them knocks out Will and they take off. When Will comes to, he grabs his gun and goes after them. When nighttime comes and Will doesn't return, Debbie and Karen go back to the Institute looking for him. John returns with them to the beach house, where they find a groggy Will waiting by the door. John invites the girls to come back to the Institute in the morning and walks back to the Institute. Karen goes by herself to the Institute the next morning (She says, ""I feel loved!"" after the encounter group lifts her up in the air in unison), while Will and Debbie spend some alone time on the beach. That night, one of the Institute's women, Frances (Pamela Serpe), is murdered. Karen takes off her top and makes a play for Will, but he rebuffs her. Will returns to the Institute, where The Maker accuses him of killing Frances. We then find out who the killer really is, but stupid girls Karen and Debbie shoot Will with his own gun. The killer (who has a hatchet) meets the girls outside the beach house, we hear a shot and then see a freeze-frame of the killer's face. The End.  This early 70's exploitation film, directed by Thomas J. Schmidt (his only directorial effort; he died at age 35 in 1975), is a severely-dated road movie full of long-haired hippies in bell bottom pants, hippies in communes and hippies being hassled by the fuzz. There were so many hippies, I nearly broke out the bug spray. Much of the film's philosophies (free love, going braless, homosexuality) seem archaic and simple-minded today as do the scenes of body painting and group encounters (not to mention the ""far-out"" dialogue). Scripters Michel Levesque (who also directed WEREWOLVES ON WHEELS [1971] and the WIP flick SWEET SUGAR [1972]), Larry Bischof and Gloria Goldsmith have crafted a story that spends way too much time on the commune life and not enough time on the murder mystery. Once we get the reveal on who the real killer is, it's way too late to care. Karen and Debbie care nothing about anyone's feelings and tease every man they run across, never putting out for anyone. I was hoping these two girls would get abused in some way to teach them a lesson but, except for the oblique ending, they do very much what they please and get away with it. For a film about free love, there's precious little nudity and there's even less blood. I This film is only of interest if you want to see an early film appearance by Michael Ontkean (who would do TV's THE ROOKIES next) and watch Papa Walton himself, Ralph Waite, sporting dashikis, spouting inane hippie psychobabble and trying to get it on with Karen. It's not a pretty sight. Also starring Michael Kopsche, Elizabeth Saxon, Paul Sorensen, Cliff Emmich and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Uschi Digard. The clever opening credits are shown as a series of bumper stickers, hand-painted signs and graffiti on a wall. Also known as HOT SUMMER WEEK. Released to theaters by Joe Solomon's Fanfare Corporation (THE LOSERS - 1970) and now available on a great-looking DVD in its original OAR from Scorpion Releasing.",1415404800,8,4473,4.6477272727272725
4133929,4,B003KO1JQ2,I would watch this movie again and again. It kept me interested.,1407024000,,64,4.416666666666667
4133930,2,B003KO1JQ2,"Takes place in the 70's, but the movie is
Just not that exciting.  Nothing really happens. There are plenty of hippies and beach scenes in it.",1401926400,,142,4.461538461538462
4133931,2,B003KO1JQ2,"The movie was stopped at the 40 minute mark, and was not very good either. I would skip this one.",1401667200,2,97,3.9
4133932,1,B003KO1JQ2,"This is one of the worst 70's drive-in movies I've ever seen, and I'm a fan of drive-in movies. The most important point is it's only 41 minutes of an 80 minute movie. What the heck Amazon, where's the rest of the movie? Even if the rest of the movie was there I don't think it would help this dog. In the first half there are so many cliches and holes in the plot the missing second half couldn't possibly fix it. Oh, if you were looking for some 70's sexploitation you won't find it here. Zero - Zip, just stupid dialog. What a bore!",1393286400,8,535,4.104761904761904
4133933,2,B003KO1JQ2,"This film is not complete! 41 mins. Where's the rest of it? Who is killing all the hippies? Peace, love, dud.",1390953600,6,109,4.238095238095238
4133934,4,B003KO1JQ2,"I'm giving it 4 stars for the simple reason that my grandfather plays the gas station attendant. He was just an Arkansas farmer who moved to California to open up a seafood restaurant (Neptune's Net in Malibu) when he was spotted and asked to be in this film. I'm very much looking forward to watching this sort of ""cult classic"" movie not only because it looks hilarious (supposedly really bad acting), but because I get to see my grandfather, Starlyn H. Young; I never got to meet him because he passed before I was born. I'm SO glad I found it on DVD!",1323388800,3,554,4.388349514563107
4133935,4,B003KO1JQ2,"The new Scorpion DVD (released in 2010) is far superior to the old VHS release of the film from the 1980's.  The DVD is anamorphic widescreen, and has a couple of extras: an interview with the screenwriter and a trailer preview.

My four-star rating mainly pertains to the new DVD itself.  The movie is fun enough, but not a drive-in classic.  It was released in 1972 under the title HOT SUMMMER WEEK, and then later retitled GIRLS ON THE ROAD.  The girls only spend the first half of the film on the road, so the retitling is a bit exploitative (wow-a drive-in movie being exploited?).

One of the girls is played by Kathleen Cody, who mainly played ""the girlfriend"" or ""the cute girl"" in some Disney comedies.  It's fun to see her get a little trashy in this film, and a nice change from her normal goody-two-shoes personna.

Those who enjoy films like THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971) and THE YOUNG CYCLE GIRLS (1978) would probably like this one, too.",1287705600,7,949,4.57396449704142

8398817,2,B003KO1JQ2,"I suppose this movie could provide insight into what the 60's really was like. However, being a witness that bizarre era, I have no use to being reminded the bad and ugly that the 60's really were.",1484352000,,197,4.351351351351352
8398818,2,B003KO1JQ2,"We watched this movie on Amazon Prime. We picked it because we are fans of Twin Peaks and this stars a young Michael Ontkean (despite not giving him billing on the description page). The picture quality was grainy but there was little B-movie charm. It follows two relatively boring young ladies looking to break free of their parents and have a wild vacation. They meet a veteran who is clearly suffering from PTSD and has been failed by the system. There is a lot of promise in the set-up and there are some good ideas floating around, but the end result is fairly tame action with messy editing and repetitive flashbacks. The scenes of the encounter group could have opened an interesting cultural window to the past but ultimately fell short. The plot twist almost worked but then they spoil it with a ""Sopranos"" style ending, made even worse by a post-credits radio blurb. I wish people learned back then that such endings are crap. They are even worse as a close to a movie of this quality level. I'm giving it a second star for it's ""almost"" but seriously, don't waste your time.",1479600000,,1086,4.603092783505154

8398820,3,B003KO1JQ2,"obvious from the outset that ""the soldier"" hadn't done the murders at Big Sur since he wasn't there at that time.  The emphasis on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was an intentionally misleading artifice.  Throwing the uniform which had been the origins of the traumatic stresses was a clear indication of restoring health as was accepting ""no"" for an answer from the primary girl and perhaps even the *choice* not to accept the other girl.  Similarly obvious that the promoter of fantasies ""the Maker"" was an obsessive avoider of reality to the point of killing characters he didn't want around any more.  That ""the Maker"" was a prime mover in the group grope situations similarly indicated avoidance of the essential rights and perquisites of Individual humans.  No mystery in this movie which proclaimed itself to be about mysterious killings.  The photography was a major weak point as was the effort to create a ""mystery"" out of a script entirely lacking in mysterious content.",1468022400,,981,5.0246913580246915

8398824,2,B003KO1JQ2,"This is a pretty dumb low-budget film, but I actually like dumb low-budget films, lol. The big surprise here was seeing Ralph Wait, the dad in the Waltons, as a beach bum philosopher/guru. It's worth watching for that. It's really not that bad of a film and if, like me, you remember the 60s vividly, you'll probably get a kick out of a some of it. The filmmaking is surprisingly solid, except EXCEPT for the weird flashback out-of-focus scenes, they are annoying and very humorous. Thank God for the fast forward button!

It's free with Amazon Prime (and I hope a lot of these old B movies show up there) and so what the heck, you can watch it for free and get a look at Daddy Walton with a beard dressed up like a hippy. :)",1441584000,,725,4.291970802919708
8398825,2,B003KO1JQ2,"Girls on the Road (also known as Hot Summer Week in case you're trying to find additional info on it) is trying to be waaay too many films at once - a coming-of-age film, a political commentary on the effects of war, a thriller and a slasher/horror for maybe five seconds. The acting is fairly decent, but the storyline drags on into nothingness for the longest stretch of the film. The only reason I stayed watching it was to see some early work of Michael Onkean (who later starred and will star again as Sheriff Harry S. Truman in Twin Peaks). But the ending is spliced together because apparently they forgot that they're supposed to catch the killer who is mentioned in the film description. Better films await.",1433980800,,716,4.6015625
