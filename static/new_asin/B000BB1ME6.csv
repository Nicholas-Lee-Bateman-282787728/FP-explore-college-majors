8084143,3,B000BB1ME6,"To me, this was sort of ""same old, same old.""  Les Sylphides was okay.  I felt that the tempos were off somehow and I've seen the ballet so many times, it gets boring.  Spartacus has some wonderful pas de deux in it, but this exerpt was not one of my favorites. The selection of ""Divertissements"" again, was a bit lackluster.  Don't get me wrong.  The Bolshoi is the Bolshoi.  If you're a die hard fan and want to own some of these perfomances from years past, then you'll enjoy it.  Had I seen it first, I don't think I would have chosen to buy it.",1385683200,,549,4.171428571428572

8084145,5,B000BB1ME6,"Historical footage of 1980s stars appearing in a Gala in London. Well worth having as an example of classical bolshoi at its best. People rave about today's technique but seeing these dancers 20 years on, today's dancers can only envy the ability of these dancers to marry art AND technique!",1178496000,11,291,4.84
