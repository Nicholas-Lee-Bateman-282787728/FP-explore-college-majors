8236333,1,B000ZSBIIU,"This DVD was a compilation of photos and videos taken by military photographers. I was very disappointed in the coverage of the facilities on base. I had hoped to show my wife, children and grandchildren the base. The video did a poor job of touring the base. After ten or fifteen minutes we were ready to give up, but kept hoping for it to get better. Very disappointing.  (DaNang '67)",1315785600,,386,4.514285714285714
8236334,5,B000ZSBIIU,"I spent 2 tours at Da Nang AB, 1966 -1967 and 1968-1969.base Fuels (POL) and flew on Bladder Birds (C123's)  This video brought back many memories, especially the rocket attack July 15, 1967 and and reminded me of many more I had forgotten. I was able to share pictures with my family of the tent city I lived in, as well as the Camp Da Nang compound we eventually moved into. My brother, a Marine, flew F4's out of the Marine side of Da Nang during my '68 - '69 tour. Totally awesome video.  I woulds reccomend to any Marine or Air Force personnel stationed at Da Nang.
