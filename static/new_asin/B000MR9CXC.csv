2739243,5,B000MR9CXC,"Found this series after watching Lisa Falkner in New Street Law...liked both, but this is much less dramatic and easier to settle back and enjoy. Loved the build up of sexual tension the detectives have with their boss. So sorry this series ended. Back to Inspector Lewis for cozy mystery treats.",1326758400,,296,4.823529411764706
2739244,1,B000MR9CXC,"I would like to review this product, but unfortunately I never received it!  Supposedly it was mailed to me as of June 16th, but I don't know what happened.  My credit card has been charged.  I have sent emails saying that the videos never arrived here, but have heard nothing back yet.  At this point I can't say I would rush to order something here again.",1279584000,,357,4.363636363636363
2739245,3,B000MR9CXC,I found this to be about the same level of enjoyment as Series 1.  I enjoy watching it  but it isn't outstanding.  There are funny parts and some good plots but overall it is just okay.,1274918400,,185,4.083333333333333
2739246,5,B000MR9CXC,This two women are right on target. From thier jobs to relationships. They are able and ready.,1259539200,,94,4.588235294117647
2739247,5,B000MR9CXC,"I came across Murder in Suburbia while browsing in my local library because, while television at any given time is sadly lacking, it's especially barren in the summer.  What a pleasant surprise!  My only regret is the apparently limited run of this series.  I can't remember the last time I sat back & actually watched a dvd without having to fill in the boring parts with flipping through a magazine.  The characters work well together, not only the main characters, but supporting also.  Writing well done also.  It was wonderful to just relax and be entertained.",1248393600,3,565,4.833333333333333
2739248,5,B000MR9CXC,"We watched some of the first programs and BBC then purchased Sets I and II and are greatly disappointed that they have been apparantly cancelled.  The two main characters are wonderul foiles for each other as the appear as different as night and day, except for their impossible love lives that never work out.  In the meantime, there is a hidden ""romance""  with the boss that creates some wonderful moments like the ""timed"" very long kiss on a stakeout or ranting about the boss' latest girlfriend who is not a girlfriend while he is listening.  In the meantime there is a case to solve.  The cases involve vivid portraits of the wayward ways of the rich in suburbia as well as the struggling middle class facing mundane problems like getting children into the right schools, blackmail, and murder.  Lisa is a wonderful ""blonde"" who solves many cases in her own inexplicabe way.  Highly recommnded. These are great entertainment.",1226793600,10,930,4.848101265822785
2739249,3,B000MR9CXC,"Not classy like BBC mysteries or something, but a lot of fun.  Not too many chances for Americans to see regular suburban Brit neighborhoods--TV usually shows villages or the city.  The mysteries are kind of slight, the fun is in the interactions of the two main characters who tend to be unlucky in love.  The humor is everyday fun altho. there are some over the top characters (crazies) in most episodes.  None of it is really believable, I'd be extremely worried if this were my police dept., but I found this set fun diversion when I wanted something light.",1224288000,6,561,4.636363636363637
2739250,5,B000MR9CXC,"The more we watched of this, the more entertained we were. We had just finished watching the Inspector Linley series, which is pretty intense and serious in comparison. It took us a while to adjust to a more humorous and not so intense a series. We wish there was more Murder in Suburbia!",1205539200,15,288,4.452830188679245
2739251,1,B000MR9CXC,This is poor for a British Detective series. The acting is poor and while I own the set I could not watch them all. Avoid,1195084800,2,121,3.88
2739252,4,B000MR9CXC,"Good series from across the pond... This is the 2nd season DVD of the  British series which follows the cases of Detectives Kate Ashurst ""Ash"" and Emma Scribbins ""Scribbs"". Ash and Scribbs are a very good team and there is good interaction and humor between them and with their boss as they solve the crimes that come across their desks in the upper middle class town of  Middleford.  Each show captures your interest.",1175990400,9,418,4.698630136986301

2739259,3,B000MR9CXC,"Affable, undemanding, and forgettable.  I like the 2 actors, but their relationship is them feeding lines to each other, wistful comments about the scarcity of available men, and not much else.  The idea is these ""suburbanites"" are posh and underneath a bunch of murderous creeps, wears thin after, say, 10 minutes.  At least with Miss Marple you get mansions and topiary gardens, this is more the racquet ball and faux-antiques crowd.  Just not interesting enough to continue watching.",1484265600,,486,5.1923076923076925

2739305,5,B000MR9CXC,"I wish there were more than just two seasons of this show.  The second season continues to develop the two female lead characters and their interesting dialogue and fun interactions.  It doesn't always have the intricacies of plot of Midsomer Murders, but the character development between the two leads is a delight.  I recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of BBC detective series.",1473292800,3,390,4.878787878787879

2739329,5,B000MR9CXC,"This picks right up from season 1, a light-hearted British murder mystery set in the northwest London suburbs follows two women detectives played by, Caroline Catz (Doc Martin) and Lisa Faulkner.  Each episode (6 50min episodes per season for 2 seasons) follows them as they solve a murder all the while operating in a traditionally male profession.  The senior detective (Catz) is from an upper class background and her partner is definitely not leading to tension and humor, especially when their love lives are discussed.
Also I really like the British penchant for crafting innovative ways of dispatching each victim.  Well worth watching.",1464739200,3,643,5.223300970873787

2739333,2,B000MR9CXC,"I watched quite a few episodes hoping they would get better, they did not.  The two detectives seemed more intrested in men than their cases. Certainly does not live up to the expectations thhat the Brits do so well.",1464134400,,216,4.538461538461538

2739361,4,B000MR9CXC,"A good series, interesting to watch. Not as good as other British series I have watched. Caroline Catz is an excellent actor and carries the series. Some of the supporting actors could be better, perhaps better writing for the supporting rolls.
Overall I really enjoyed Series 1 & 2 and would recommend it",1412380800,,305,4.773584905660377
2739362,4,B000MR9CXC,Love both of these actresses and their snide humor as single women detectives with a crush on their gorgeous boss.  Only two seasons but worth it for those of us who love our British mysteries.,1411776000,,193,4.514285714285714
2739363,5,B000MR9CXC,Wonderful British who done it series with a strong cast and the always superb Caroline Catz. These are stories meant to surprise you at the very last moment as to who done it.,1411689600,,175,4.333333333333333
2739364,5,B000MR9CXC,Love it.,1407888000,,8,3.5
2739365,4,B000MR9CXC,"I wish there was a 3.5. That is what I would give this-really fun and entreating, but not something I remember well or would rave about to a friend. The actresses are better than the writing-they use too much of the same formula, too often, but it is light and fun and if you enjoy BBC crime shows and want one that's light on the gore? You might enjoy this woman partner show :)",1404777600,,379,4.135135135135135
2739366,5,B000MR9CXC,"I can watch Scribbs and Ash over and over again.  I was so sorry that the series only last for two seasons.  I always wondered why.  The writing was witty, amusing and clever.  The relationship between the two characters was great.  I also love watching how the British handle crime without weapons.",1396051200,3,299,4.673076923076923
2739367,4,B000MR9CXC,"This is not ""Prime Suspect"", it wasn't written by Agatha Christie or given a big budget by PBS or the BBC. It is more lighthearted, along the lines of ""Castle"". I found Caroline Cates and Lisa Faulkner to be engaging as the leads and enjoyed their bantering. The writing is improved over Season 1, which wasn't really bad to begin with. Like many shows these days it was cancelled just as it seemed to be hitting it's stride. I would have enjoyed a season 3.",1395878400,3,458,4.4
2739368,5,B000MR9CXC,"I loved this British version of Cagney and Lacey. The stories were fresh, very much today, and the squad room was comparable to any American squad room of detectives",1395360000,,165,4.724137931034483
2739369,5,B000MR9CXC,The DVD quality was great.  This is a very good female detective duo.  The story lines have murder mystery and comic relief combined.,1392681600,,133,4.739130434782608
2739370,5,B000MR9CXC,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Murder in Suburbia"".  Each episode was a delicious mystery with terrific characters, led of course by Emma and Kate. Production values for the discs were top notch.  Highly recommened!",1382659200,2,218,5.2
2739371,4,B000MR9CXC,"Charming, light detective show -- well-acted with clever, if slightly dated plots (one was about wife swapping, for example). The female leads are very personable and have a light relationship with their boss. A refreshing change from today's harsher TV shows. If you liked this, you will probably like New Tricks and Death in Paradise too.",1382313600,,340,5.089285714285714
2739372,3,B000MR9CXC,Its cute show about two detectives in a mans world. Their investigating procedures are quite unique..over all  a good show,1379030400,2,122,5.1
2739373,4,B000MR9CXC,"British TV shows always have a slight off kilter feel, which for me adds to the entertainment.  I enjoyed this whole series the two leading actresses were a hoot.",1378512000,,162,4.586206896551724
2739374,5,B000MR9CXC,"Even though this series was not as intense as some detective shows, I really enjoyed it and wanted more. The two women played quite well off each other. Their crime solving episodes were well written and played. I don't think they were meant to be as bloody and dark as other shows . Well done.",1378339200,,294,4.363636363636363
2739375,4,B000MR9CXC,"I am a big Caroline Catz fan and this is a really enjoyable series. The main attraction is the interaction between Scribbs (Lisa Faulkner) and Ash (Caroline Catz). They're both really attractive and personable characters. I wish there were subtitles. Some of the British slang was unfamiliar to me and I would have liked to see the script. The stories were good without being too dark, and the relationship between Ash and her boss was a tease and holds some real promise for the future.",1378252800,,487,4.741176470588235
2739376,5,B000MR9CXC,I enjoy the stories in Suburbia.  The interaction between the 2 women is fun to watch.  I love Caroline Catz; she was wonderful in Doc Martin too.  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a lighter murder mystery.,1376956800,,224,4.55
2739387,5,B000MR9CXC,"Loved to see two women detectives with their dating issues instead of the usual men.
Love the stories from the BBC",1376092800,,114,4.476190476190476
2739388,3,B000MR9CXC,I enjoyed this series.  The story lines were interesting.  I do think there are others though that are much better.,1376006400,,115,4.7
2739389,5,B000MR9CXC,"Snappy dialogue, great cast chemistry, tongue-in-cheek all the way.  (Notably the closing episode.)  Cheers to Scribbs & Ash!  Yes! to Sully.",1375574400,,141,5.619047619047619
2739390,5,B000MR9CXC,Love this series! Wish there were more seasons. Love the electricity and vibe they set off. Great to watch repeatedly.,1375315200,,118,4.95
2739391,4,B000MR9CXC,"No one would confuse Murder in Suburbia with Prime Suspect, but few shows are.  This is an entertaining police drama with enjoyable humor mixed in that is greatly benefited by its stars.",1375228800,,186,4.8125
2739392,5,B000MR9CXC,"The wife loved it

Castillo had an 82-104 record in 13 major league seasons. He pitched for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado, Detroit, Toronto, Boston and Florida from 1991 to 2005 before retiring and lived in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale.",1375142400,,237,4.925
2739393,4,B000MR9CXC,Two single women police officers.  These two play off each other really well.  I love Caroline Cats from Doc Martin.,1374624000,,116,4.75
2739394,3,B000MR9CXC,I used to watch these shows when they came on television and I've always wanted to see them again. I think they are very well written and should be shown all of the time.,1374364800,,170,4.029411764705882
2739395,4,B000MR9CXC,"Season two, alas the last one. Wish there were more. Maybe we can all send a tin of biscuits to whom ever makes the decision so they will bring Scribbs and Ash back, even if it has been a long time.",1374364800,,198,3.8536585365853657
2739396,5,B000MR9CXC,"Sit back with a cup of coffee, prop your feet up and watch Catz solve another mystery that has stumped all of Englands police.  And even if the murders are easily solved it does not matter as Catz and her assistant DC are so attractive it`s fun to just watch them.  I enjoy how British police are either inscrutable, drunks or beautiful.  Watch Murder in Suburbia it`s entertaining and you will want more.",1373760000,,405,4.52054794520548
2739397,4,B000MR9CXC,When you can get past the British lack of censorship in regard to situations and language it is still an entertaining show.  Only a couple of seasons of the show but fun to see some female leads.,1373414400,,195,4.27027027027027
2739398,4,B000MR9CXC,"I found the characters likeable, the store lines were interesting, although becoming more and more predictable as the series continued.  This Brit mystery is lighter and less intense than most of the British mystery genre but still enjoyable.",1373414400,,242,5.368421052631579
2739399,3,B000MR9CXC,"Got old after 5-6 episodes; kept thinking it would improve. Not bad, just not better. Give it a look and decide...",1372982400,,114,4.476190476190476
2739400,4,B000MR9CXC,"This is a well done series lying somewhere between the nurder mystery and cop drama genres. The regulars on the cast are simpatico, which isn't always the case with these series.",1371686400,,178,4.774193548387097
2739401,5,B000MR9CXC,The theme of the ladies' banter and their involvement with their gorgeous supervisor might diminish the theme of murder but oh it is a guilty pleasure!,1370736000,,151,4.846153846153846
2739402,5,B000MR9CXC,"I really enjoyed the relationship between the two female detectives.
The stories were well written with twists and turns.  I would recommend the series.",1370476800,,152,5.333333333333333
2739403,4,B000MR9CXC,Mildly entertaining cop show with endearing characters but not great stories. Well played but a bit unforgettable. Worth a watch.,1370390400,,129,5.5
2739404,5,B000MR9CXC,"This is a great show if you are a bid tired of watching crime shows that show a lot of gore.  Sometimes I just want to watch the officers solve a crime without seeing all the gruesome details.  This show fit the bill in season 2.  Season 1 was not that great but there was an improvement with Season 2. This is definitely not a ""CSI"" type of show, it is more of a fluffy crime solving show.",1370131200,,390,3.9743589743589745
2739405,5,B000MR9CXC,I am enjoying this series.  For a murder/crime series it is fresh.  The two female lead characters are well played by the actresses.  The plots are quirky.  I have had to spend most of the winter cooped up due to health concerns and have needed to rely on my computer and streaming video to keep me from going crazy.  This show has helped.  I recommend this show for entertainment value.,1368921600,,387,4.457142857142857
2739406,5,B000MR9CXC,I enjoyed the series.  The acting was good and the story lines were interesting.  I wasn't a huge fan of the crush the women seemed to have on their boss.  That part seemed a little juvenile but the rest of it was great.,1368835200,,220,4.069767441860465
2739411,5,B000MR9CXC,I watched season 1 and got hooked.  Season 2 seems even better and like that they have developed the captains character and wonder where things will go with the captain and the detective.  I am at the last episode and debating as to whether or not to save it or just go ahead and watch it as I hate to see it end.  As they say all good things come to an end and I will enjoy every last minute of the last episode.  Hopefully there are other seasons.,1368576000,,449,4.01123595505618
2739412,4,B000MR9CXC,"The mysteries are good, but I really enjoy watching Caroline Catz and Lisa Ferguson work together.  These two ladies are pros anf it shows in their performance.",1368489600,,160,4.925925925925926
2739413,5,B000MR9CXC,The series was great.  I could not believe the show lasted only 2 years in England.  Two single  female detective solve murders in their own way.  Murder scenes during the day and dating scenes during the night. Light comedy. I wish there were more seasons.,1368144000,,257,4.644444444444445
2739414,4,B000MR9CXC,"I love the acting, characters, and plots. Nicely done and fun to watch. Watched all the episodes and will miss the series.",1367798400,,122,4.590909090909091

2739416,4,B000MR9CXC,"I really enjoyed this series, unfortunately there were only 2 seasons of it.
I wish they had made another season of it.  Very entertaining",1367107200,,138,4.75
2739417,5,B000MR9CXC,Just enjoy the sisterhood.... Hopefully one of them will get together with the handsome hunk... Their.boss.... This is crime show... But lighthearted... And compassionate...,1367020800,,173,6.25
2739418,3,B000MR9CXC,Good story lines funny and nice lady detectives and I like how they get along together.i hope to see more them.,1366761600,,111,4.333333333333333
2739419,2,B000MR9CXC,"Very little real crime drama here, lots of schmaltz.  Suburbia is about a saccharin as the name implies and the lead detectives spend more time worrying about there hair, clothes and shoes than about the murders they happen to be investigating.  Solving the crimes seems to be an after-thought, finding the right guy is much more important.",1365638400,,340,4.947368421052632
2739420,5,B000MR9CXC,Again I was pleased with the talent in making this series; I only wish there were more to the series.  I sometimes think the BBC cancels before a series has the chance to gain a following but I am just pleased they made as many as they did. Thank you.,1363305600,,251,4.02
2739421,4,B000MR9CXC,"enjoyable partnership  Sound was a bit difficult  kept getting too loud then suddenly inaudible  Missed a few of the ""one liners"" that way",1363219200,,138,4.913043478260869
2739422,5,B000MR9CXC,"Fun characters, interesting plots, great entertainment and I am bummed it didn't last more than two seasons! Maybe a yearly special.",1362787200,,132,5.333333333333333
2739423,2,B000MR9CXC,Love Ash but there's just something missing...you keep hoping for something good and it never comes...sorry.  that's all I got.,1362787200,,127,5.35
2739424,5,B000MR9CXC,"Again, more of what we love from Season One.  Caroline Catz (Louisa Glasson on Doc Martin, among other roles), and Lisa Faulkner are great together.  The plotlines are believable, an entertaining. Well worth viewing..",1361923200,,217,5.352941176470588
2739425,3,B000MR9CXC,"Not so good as the first season in that the plots have even less to do with suburbia than tge last and that the writers have to find other locations. Also there are fewer guest stars of some repute and there seems to be no developments in either the search for the right man or resolution of the obsession with the DCI.

The ah-hah moments still exist but the focus is now on the blonde rather than the brunette.

Rather twee, not gory but then muders in suburbia are supposed to be somewhat ordinary rather like the detectives who investigate them.",1361750400,,549,4.425742574257426
2739426,4,B000MR9CXC,"Sadly, this show has not continued. I truly enjoyed the lighter touch given to a gruesome subject. The last episode left a few subjects hanging, however.",1361404800,,153,4.923076923076923
2739427,4,B000MR9CXC,Too bad. There are only 2 season REALLY  enjoyable to watch.  To bad there ISN'T CLOSE CAPTION.  Love it though,1361145600,,111,4.45

2739429,5,B000MR9CXC,"I chose this rating because we thought it was a good show.  Cast and story line were excellent.  Although  there were crimes of murder, robbery, etc. displayed, they were handled without gruesome scenes, etc.",1355616000,,208,5.0588235294117645
2739430,1,B000MR9CXC,"Disappointing story lines.

Too sloppy acting.

8171028,1,B000MR9CXC,Not the rating for the show but the rating for the product-enjoyed season 1 but couldn't watch season 2 because the subtitles were way out of sync. If you desire or require englishsubtitles don't bother watching this. It's too bad I was looking forward to watch this after enoying season 1,1503964800,,289,4.686274509803922
