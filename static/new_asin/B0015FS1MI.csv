8258242,5,B0015FS1MI,"This film brilliantly captures the genius of John Cage through interviews of fellow artists as well as scientists and market vendors in the streets of Paris. The way in which the film is edited underlines Cage's philosophy of sound, silence, and randomness with constantly shifting landscapes and Cage's own music combined with sounds from the natural environment. It is a tribute to John Cage that also is a great introduction to the composer's music, life, and philosophy.",1309910400,,474,5.1688311688311686
8258243,5,B0015FS1MI,"A memoriam by fellow artists and paris shopkeepers to the unforgettably original and deliciously sweet John Cage featuring a joyful gentle John Cage, clearly aware his days are numbered on this earth, with some memorable quips and remembrances of his own.  This lovely tribute is so respecfully and delightfully in keeping with Cage's sensibility..no doubt he would have loved it and smiled that very special smile that takes over his whole being.  I would like to think one doesn't have to alreday love John Cage to appeciate this celebration of him.  I would like to think it could be an invitation and introduction to those, especially of the under 30's, who may not even know who he was. Because John Cage was, and is, worth knowing.",1287878400,5,737,4.833333333333333
