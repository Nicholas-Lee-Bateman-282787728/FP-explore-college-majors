6308206,1,B00J0BTEO8,was excited for a new zombie movie that might be good but it was an entire let down. i couldn't even finish it--and i always try to finish movies. if you are curious wait till it is on cable or netflix or something. just don't pay for it.,1412121600,,238,3.9791666666666665

6308208,5,B00J0BTEO8,"Really interesting take on the zombie genre. Loved the music -- reminded me of Phantasm. Simple, pretty clear, plenty of gore, but much more about the human drama.",1410048000,,163,4.857142857142857

6308210,5,B00J0BTEO8,"First of all, what is The Eschatrilogy?  The title is a clever play on words: eschatology being a branch of theology concerning the end of the world, or end of days, a trilogy being a 3 part piece.  And there you have it - the Eschatrilogy is a 3 part story cleverly knitted together under a central theme of a world gone to Hell.

The story begins with a young man finding a mysterious stranger passed out in his camp, his refuge from the world.  Looking through the man's belongings he finds a book and begins to read through.  The stories he reads are told and brought to life by a great ensemble of new, relatively inexperienced actors.  It's unlikely you'll recognise many of them, with the exception of Sarah Jane Honeywell of CBeebies fame, who makes a lovely cameo in the film, or George 'This is England' Newton who also appears.

This film was made on a micro-budget, with many of the support cast and pretty much all of the zombies being volunteers.  The best compliment I can pay this film is: it doesn't 'feel' like a low budget film.  The production, cinematography and soundtrack - plus the special FX, prostehetics and script all very much have a polished, big film feel about them.  Director/writer/star Damian Morter has worked silk out of fresh air, and this is quite possibly the best film you've not seen yet.  Buy it.  Buy it now!",1404172800,12,1352,4.541322314049586
6308211,4,B00J0BTEO8,"Even though it's a low budget movie. The soundtrack is spot on akin to Carpenter, very eerie in places. had me gripped.
It just goes to show that you don't need the budget of Spielberg to keep the audience entertained.
Reminiscent of the Creepshows and the Tales from the Darkside anthology's of old, but yet with zombies thrown into the mix...some of the acting was questionable, but looking on IMDB the budget was extremely small,  the visuals were stunning and the story is a great nod to Portmanteau and great to see something ambitious like this in the over saturated zombie genre.",1402012800,8,586,4.745098039215686
6308212,1,B00J0BTEO8,I bought 2 new to me Zombie Movies a few days ago and I am very sorry to say this one wins for the worst Zombie Movie so far. I think it had potential but the writers gave up before the cameras rolled. Truly no Zombie Movie ends very well but many at least tell a story you can follow. this one not so much. I collect Zombie Movies so I have an excuse to buy junkers priced much too high like this one. you at least have been warned. save your money.,1401840000,3,450,3.849462365591398
6308213,3,B00J0BTEO8,"Matthew (Tim Mcgill Grieveson) lives by himself in a self sufficient post zombie apocalypse era. He spends his time burning bodies and trying to contact people by radio. A stranger (Stuart Wolfenden) comes to his isolated ""fortress"" only to pass out. Mathew reads zombie stories from the stranger's book which comprises much of the film. The first episode concerns the rural beginnings of the zombie issue as a cowboy looking fellow with hat and spurs emerging from a grave as an anti-Christ or something (the explanation tried to be religious without being religious) and starts the zombie craze in a nation that doesn't have a Second Amendment designed to protect the general population from such things.

The second story is in a small city during the peak of the outbreak and the third concerns the beginning of a remote survivalist group.  As always in such tales, the fourth story concerns the story teller.

My biggest fear of obtaining this DVD (Walmart $9.96) was that the three tales would be parts of other films, or worse, a hand held camera running and screaming in the dark. That was not the case. The zombies were decently made up with a Tor Johnson looking guy who seemed to be on the screen more than George Clooney in a George Clooney film. The stories circled back with minor irony. However on the down side there was no character development. Most characters are alive for 20-30 minutes of screen time before they stick their arms up in the air and start dragging their feet.

The zombie direction seemed to be a bit off. Their movement was hit and miss. Sometimes they attack, other times they ignore. In one scene a little zombie girl has her hands down and is just standing in front of a human, then after the camera pans away and comes back, she suddenly has her arms up in zombie attack mode. The motion was awkward.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Works as a rental.",1401494400,7,1906,4.677611940298507
