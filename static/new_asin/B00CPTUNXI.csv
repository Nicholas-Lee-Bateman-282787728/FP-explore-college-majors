8584830,5,B00CPTUNXI,"My kids have loved Chuck and Friends since they first found it and honestly it is a wholesome cartoon I don't mind.  This new DVD has ten episodes on it for almost two hours of truck fun.  There are great lessons for kids such as working together, friendship, responsibility and other lessons that are easy enough for young kids to follow.  Chuck and his friends get into lots of mischief but they have fun adventures and I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate.",1379116800,,473,4.607142857142857
8584831,5,B00CPTUNXI,"My kids have always liked Chuck & Friends so we were looking forward to watching his new adventures on The Adventures of Chuck & Friends: Bumpers Up!

I've personally always appreciated Chuck because of the amount of focus on life lessons and doing the right thing for kids about my age (4 and 5). They are my little sponges soaking everything in so I want them watching only things that will be a good influence on them.

Even though I have a boy and a girl, both of them equally love to play with the dirt and ever since Chuck came along, they started acting out these little adventures with their own trucks. I love that they have ten new episodes to choose from in their play. Chuck & Friends really encourages the use of imagination and creativity which are two things we love in our house.

One thing that is big with my kids right now is competition. I can't count the number of times I hear ""I win"" and ""I beat you"" in my house daily! So I especially appreciated the episodes that dealt with this. I want my kids to know it's ok to compete but that it's ok to not win every race and it's their spirit and attitude that are important.

The Adventures of Chuck & Friends: Bumpers Up is full of it's usual adventures, mishaps and family friendly fun!",1376438400,,1255,4.327659574468085
