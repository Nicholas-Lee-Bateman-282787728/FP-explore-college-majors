1173071,5,9742530858,I decided to get the DVD set as this is ne of my favorite korean dramas. The DVD quality is good.,1382659200,,97,3.6666666666666665
1173072,3,9742530858,"The subtitles pop in and out too quickly, which makes it hard to catch everything, if you're not a fast reader. Because it is Netflix on my computer, it took longer than I wanted to wait, for it to reposition itself. I find that I'm doing this often. It's very tiresome. The grammar is not always correct either. The story itself is cute and interesting. It starts out boring though. I think I've tried to watch it twice, before I decided to skip the first episode. But the acting is good and it's worth watching.",1381536000,,513,4.410526315789474
1173073,5,9742530858,"Although the plot is highly improbable, it is well written.  It was nice to see an unassuming but delightful young woman go from wrags to riches in a truly believable manner, it does help when the hero is truly handsome!
From scullery maid to National Princess in an orderly  and chronological order, the script was well written.  It makes you want to stsnd up and cheer...well worth buyingbthis series for my collection.",1373760000,,421,4.819444444444445
1173074,5,9742530858,"""My Princess"" is a charming romantic comedy about a commoner who finds out she's a princess, and the diplomat who will lose his inheritance if the reclamation of the Korean monarchy succeeds. The same man who is given the task of tutoring the new princess to do well in her new role.

The drama remains fairly lighthearted, though there are a few episodes here and there which get more emotional. What I liked about it is that the characters never remain separated for long, and even during their considerably short separations, the drama continues to be sweet and enjoyable. Song Seung Heon and Kim Tae Hee are two of Korea's finest; both in charisma and beauty, so even if the plot was a little stale (which it most certainly is not) these two could have pulled it off. But the story is solid, and most side characters are interesting. However, Director Oh, and the princess's step-sister, ""Dan,"" are the villains of the story, and tend to bring down the level of enjoyment with their despicable plots. Despite those two schemers, this is still one of the best K-dramas I've seen, and I will watch it again and again.

Anyone who loves a good princess story (and romance) will truly enjoy this series.",1372982400,,1203,4.669811320754717

1173078,5,9742530858,"In the category of romantic and funny Korean drama, this has to be my favorite of all time. I love the chemistry between the two lead actors (Song Seung Heon and Kim Tae Hee), they are both great actors. I gave this dvd a 5 stars rating because there is nothing that I don't like about it, the story line, the acting and the subtitle is good. I recommend this dvd to anybody who loves romantic comedy, even if you don't speak Korean you'll fall in love with this Korean drama and probably buy more Korean drama in the future too.",1357948800,4,529,4.247524752475248

7901733,5,9742530858,"It has Kim Tae Hee that's all I need. However, I also like Seung Hun. It has a good story plot, with fairy tale setting of revival of the last Korean monarchy of Joseon. The funny bickering and hate/love attractions/chemistry are all there. This is a Drama that you can watch over and over again.",1397433600,,296,4.4
7901734,4,9742530858,"It is difficult for any film to combine romance, screwball comedy, and melodrama but MY PRINCESS does it better than any other of its ilk. This Korean import takes the ditzy character of The Princess (Kim Tae Hee) who has the fairy tale conversion of one who portrays a princess to one who really is. Along the way she meets, quarrels with, and gradually falls in love with Diplomat Park (Song Seung Hong). Much of the film is rooted in the deep and abiding respect that many modern Koreans have with their long discarded monarchy. Though South Korea currently has a representative republic voting form of government, movies like this one go to great pains to dangle the Joseon Dynasty monarchy in front of the viewer. Further, MY PRINCESS combines fairy tale elements of Cinderella, an allusion noted by one of the cast. There is even a wicked stepmother figure present in Director Oh who is coolly determined to crush the Princess. This is not merely a plot driven film though the basic impetus involves whether the monarchy will be restored. Much of the dramatic tension revolves around the growing feelings between Diplomat Park and the Princess. The former comes off as one who has to hide his inner emotions behind a stern countenance of rules and logic while the latter is his polar opposite, a woman who bursts out in tears every ten minutes as she stumbles from one faux pas to another. MY PRINCESS is a delightful sixteen episode series that balances ever so gently the power and prestige of royalty with the unforgiving duties of that royalty.",1396137600,,1554,4.7592592592592595
