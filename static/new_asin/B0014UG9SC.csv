8256335,4,B0014UG9SC,"This is a great half hour DVD of Bill in concert. It is so good to see him do his thing live, how he moves on stage and delivered his biting wit and comedy. This is one of the place's (the other being 'Totally Bill Hicks' which includes a documentary about his career) to go for your first outing of live Bill, the political satire is especially good and what Bill should ultimately be remembered for. Short and sweet hit of Hicks.",1299283200,,431,4.2682926829268295
8256336,4,B0014UG9SC,"Recently I watched '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-The-Bill-Hicks-Story/dp/B003A4GBJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American - The Bill Hicks Story</a>' and went off on a tangent from it by exploring what Bill's twin comedian -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dwight-Slade/dp/B001LPNVUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dwight Slade</a>&nbsp;- had been doing (the guy who used to be Hicks's stage partner at the age of 15).
Curiously enough Dwight Slade has just released a double DVD called 'Right & Raunch', which has one DVD that is ""TV-clean, family friendly set that you can show your grandmother"" & another which is ""uncensored and fun!  (Best to put grandma to bed...)"". In other words one good, one evil.
It made me think that, if only we could do this with Bill Hicks, then we could have one DVD of stuff on drugs, smoking and 'Just a ride' that would make good, light introductory material and then another to introduce new fans onto the full-strength stuff later on.

Unfortunately Bill wasn't like this and even his lighter stuff had dark stuff threaded through it. However, this DVD is the closest approximation to the good side of Bill & contains the clip that forms a key part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Traffic/dp/B000TR6BC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Traffic</a>&nbsp;(""This is not a very popular idea; you don't hear it very often, but it's the truth: I did drugs and I had a real good time."")

As well as this, this DVD has an excellent start (with Bill stuck in an airport) and some fairly easy on the ear routines on smoking and drugs.
Admittedly there is a small dark-patch towards the end of the DVD where Bill talks about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judas-Priest/dp/B003AYPMBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judas Priest</a>&nbsp;(who allegedly wrote satanic messages in their music) and Pornography (which he graphically illustrates is no different to advertising), but these are more than redeemed by the ending ('We Live in a World/ The Vision' routine).

So, there you have it - a Bill Hicks DVD with good stuff either side and only a little dark stuff in the middle. As they say in the army: it's a poo sandwich!
The one regret I have is that this DVD isn't longer (25-30 minutes). However, I think this is in a way a blessing since any longer routine would be likely to veer towards the ad nauseam tendencies of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Relentless-DVD/dp/B000E1P2P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Relentless DVD</a>&nbsp;or Bill's other Chicago performance - the infamous Heckler incident.

In all, this DVD is worth watching although, as my fellow reviewer B.Parker points out, it is better to get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bill-Hicks-Live-Satirist-Social-Critic-Stand-Up-Comedian/dp/B0004Z33FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian</a>, as this includes this routine, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Relentless/dp/B000E1P2P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Relentless</a>&nbsp;one PLUS the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Totally-Dominion-Theatre/dp/B00005AWG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Totally/ Dominion Theatre</a>&nbsp;DVD.
If you haven't got that though, then do get this one as it is required watching for the evolution of our species...",1292630400,,3597,6.91409691629956
