6759201,5,B00OQRU9CW,"If like me you are a fan of this anime, this Ranma 1/2 TV Series are a MUST HAVE: remastered, fullHD in original TV 4:3 format, japanese voices (also english), subtitles, full color booklet with episode list, extras... you will never get a best quality picture version of this anime (in fact, this is the same as the last BluRay japanese edition but with voices, subtitles, menus... localized to english). And this is a limited edition so get it while it lasts or you will regret it!",1428710400,,483,4.563218390804598

6759204,3,B00OQRU9CW,"This collection holds some of the weakest storylines for the series, and a fan could be forgiven if they wanted to skip this particular release for some of collections with stronger stories and plots. A few episodes are passable, but unless it's for the sake of having the complete collection, this set could easily fall by the wayside.",1426550400,2,336,4.810344827586207
6759205,5,B00OQRU9CW,"The first four Limited Edition sets of Ranma 1/2 have goon far beyond my expectations, and have proved to me a must own for anime fans.  Since this is the fifth season I'm going to assume that if you're reading this you know what Ranma is about, so I'm just going to list some product features that fans might want to know.  Another thing to note is that the dub voice of Ranma changes in Season Four, but that's not a big deal, because the sub is better any way.

This special edition includes a full-color art card and a 32-page booklet with episode summaries, all housed in a premium chipboard artbox!

Contains episodes 93-115.

Special Features: ""We love Ranma"" Part 5 - We Love Collecting, Next Episode Previews, Clean Openings and Endings.

Spoken Languages: English, Japanese, English subtitles.

Just in case readers are wondering that Kanji on the box means five in Japanese.",1423872000,4,885,4.707792207792208

8684534,1,B00OQRU9CW,While the reissue of the series issue well restored the actual distribution of the series has been poorly handled again creating a giant vacuum on set 4 and 5 while all the others can easily be obtained at an affordable price. A mistake somewhere on Viz Videos part has made 4 and 5 an easy burn on the fan with very limited copy available for purchase unless you are willing to pay upwards of 200 $ for each season. Too bad that they can not make smart business moves.,1472860800,6,469,4.280898876404494

8684536,5,B00OQRU9CW,"Everything was great except the product came damaged. It was sealed and looks brand new, but the blu-ray case inside of the box was damaged inside. I opened it for the first time and little blue pieces fell out. the hinge that the discs reside on was broken. Kind of a bummer but it looks like that was just bad luck. I've bought the previous box sets and they all came undamaged as far as I could tell.",1462233600,,403,4.17948717948718
