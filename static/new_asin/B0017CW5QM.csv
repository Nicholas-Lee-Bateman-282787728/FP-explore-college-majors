As a therapist he is way in over his head and should retire. As far as the movie goes, Demi is at her best in a softer way, the cast is good and the story just a feel good movie. Weird, I don't do movie reviews, hahaha. The subplots are good with some surprising acting / singing by Mary Steenburgen who is funny and can sing the blues.

8265582,5,B0017CW5QM,"This is an all around great movie!!! First, it's Al Pacino!! Second, everyone else is stupendous!! Michelle Pfeiffer finally plays a real woman and she's even more lovable and approachable without the Hollywood glamour tricks. And the supporting cast quite possibly ""outshines"" both of them!!!! You gotta see it, a movie for everyone!",1379808000,,334,5.320754716981132

8265584,5,B0017CW5QM,"I bought this for ""Butcher's Wife"" because I think I have watched this movie at least 10 times.  I love the idea that there are people that are meant to be together.",1353715200,,165,4.15625
8265585,5,B0017CW5QM,"toonestly, if you don't have these movies in your collection you need to buy this combo pack.  they are two of my favorite movies, filled with friendships and love!:)",1333584000,,166,4.724137931034483
8265586,5,B0017CW5QM,"For one low price you get two feel good romantic comedy's.  ""Frankie & Johnny"" stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino.  The movie is one of my favorites and is about a down and out waitress who is courted persistently by a love struck cook.  It's funny, warm and moving all at the same time.  It's set in New York City with a wonderful array of colorful characters that work at a diner.  Michelle Pfeiffer had once said that this was one of her favorite roles and probably the one that is closest to her personally.  This would be hard to believe considering Michelle is one cinema's great beauties and she does her best to dress as down and be as melancholy as possible in this movie.

""The Butcher's Wife"" is a great addition to this double feature.  It's lighter fare than ""Frankie & Johnny"" which is a more realistic romance of the two films.  Still, ""The Butcher's Wife"" has enough magic in it to satisfy even the coldest heart.  Demi Moore plays a clairvoyant who sees a Butcher washed ashore on her beach.  She follows him to New York city and marries him.  She enchants everyone in the town, but her husband starts questioning her motives as well as the local level headed psychiatrist.

**At the posting of this review, this is the only way to get ""The Butcher's Wife"" at a reasonable price.  Buying the movie solo you'll find it being sold at outrageous prices as the actual movie DVD release seems to have been pulled off the market.  The studio has no information at this time if it will be re-released.**",1332720000,,1516,4.501831501831502
8265587,4,B0017CW5QM,I bought the movie because I had viewed it before and liked it.  As a bonus for the same low price the movie Frankie & Johnny was included.,1325203200,,139,3.9642857142857144
8265588,5,B0017CW5QM,I love this movie because it has some beautiful footage of the Cape Lookout Lighthouse.  The story is cute too...a little fantasy.,1315267200,,130,4.909090909090909
