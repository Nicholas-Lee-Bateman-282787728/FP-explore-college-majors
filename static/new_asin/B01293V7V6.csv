8725724,5,B01293V7V6,Everything went smoothly. No problems. Would recommend.,1457568000,,55,7.0
8725725,4,B01293V7V6,"I won't go into the title specifics as they have been covered already, but it should be noted that not all of the titles are widescreen, The Delta Force, The Hitman & Hellbound are all fullscreen or as the disclaimer states ""modified to fit your screen""!!!!
Well, it's definitely full of bombs, there are the babes in the movies & at one time, they were blockbusters! It's more an ""ode"" to Chuck Norris , who leads the pack with five films, two by Sylvester Stallone, one from Jean Claude Van Damme & one from Dolph Lundgren. What? nothing from Charles Bronson???? what a shame!!!! & of course, the documentary Electric Boogaloo (not the movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo!!!!), the Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films. It's a bit short for me, but it's thorough enough to enjoy & understand the beginnings & ultimate ""demise"" of Cannon Films.
There are a few trailers & deleted scenes on the Electric Boogaloo disc, but fails in comparison to the blu-ray versions available in Germany & Australia as there's more content on those discs! A gem for fans of these films, they have NOT been cleaned-up, audio enhanced or any significant Special Features been added!!!! Enjoy & kill some time with this boxset!!!!",1456531200,5,1209,4.7894736842105265
8725726,5,B01293V7V6,"As a fan of 80's action films, I am very familiar with many of the movies produced by Cannon Films. When I hear they were releasing a box set with a full length documentary on the history of Cannon, I knew I had to buy this. While I enjoyed most of the movies included in this collection (Cobra, Blood Sport and Invasion USA are easily my favorites here) I felt that they left out 2 of Cannons best movies. Runaway Train and Death Wish 4 should have definitely been included in the set. Other than that, I highly recommend this release to anyone who likes fun and straight forward action movies as well as entertaining and often hilarious documentaries.",1450569600,5,653,4.495798319327731
8725727,2,B01293V7V6,"Cannon films released 100's of movies throughout the 80's
9 of them are in this boxset released by Warner bros
and guess Warner bros bought the rights to the Chuck norris films because they were owned by MGM
9 of them are the Action cannon films by Chuck norris, sylvester stallone and one Van damme film
MISSING IN ACTION, INVASION USA, COBRA, THE DELTA FORCE, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE
OVER THE TOP, BLOODSPORT, THE HITMAN & HELLBOUND
there are no new special features, no new sound mix or new Digital remaster transfers
all films have just been recycled in new packaging new cover art that's it
the dvd boxset says 10 dvd pack, it's 9 dvd's the 10th Disc is the Cannon Documentary
ELECTRIC BOOGALOO which you can buy on DVD seperatley anyway
this Documentary is one of the best cannon Doco's ever goes for 105mins
and there's interviews with so many Actors & Actresses from the Cannon films
plus Directors & writers who worked with Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus the creators of the Cannon films
so if you already have the original dvd versions of the above films and the Electric boogaloo Documentary
it's waste of money buying this new Cannon films collection, you're just Double dipping if you buy it
1-2 stars for this new boxset",1449792000,6,1232,4.63013698630137

8725729,5,B01293V7V6,"What a rad set! You couldn't get all these movies for a better price, plus ELECTRIC BOOGALOO (which I'd been anxiously waiting a year to see). EB also includes 35 minutes of original Cannon trailers and 15 minutes of deleted scenes. Each movie comes on its own disc and is packaged in a nice hard case with slip cover. You'll totally get your low budget schlocktastic bang for your buck!",1443484800,15,387,4.542857142857143
