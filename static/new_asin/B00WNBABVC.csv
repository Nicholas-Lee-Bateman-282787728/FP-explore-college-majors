7133136,5,B00WNBABVC,YES! Can't wait!,1411516800,,16,4.666666666666667
7133137,3,B00WNBABVC,"This review is mostly for season pass purchasers.  Please read in its entirety before rating it helpful or not.
  The Walking Dead is an amazing series so far that has kept me coming back each year.  As the season progresses I will promptly give it the 5 (really like 4.5 if I could) stars the series has earned

  The season pass purchases seems to have changed, I assume so people don't get a discount on one episode and then stop purchasing.  I was hesitant to purchase the season pass after reading the 1 star review but did anyway.  I was mostly curious if the season pass discount would apply since I didn't notice any mention of how much it was.  Here is how the bill broke down.

$41.99 (HD)
Item Subtotal: $41.99
Promotions:  -$6.00
Tax Collected: $0.00
Grand Total: $35.99

So it appears the $6 is the discount for the season pass purchase and the $41.99 is the cost for the season if episodes are purchased individually.

 I hope this helps someone out there; I can't wait for the premier!",1411516800,117,1000,4.477777777777778
7133138,5,B00WNBABVC,"Such a great show and so addictive. For the amount of entertainment I get from watching this show, this is such a bargain. Season five appears to still be on TV and not available on Amazon. I purchased season four and it was such a deal.",1411430400,2,237,4.173913043478261

7133141,1,B00WNBABVC,"I signed up for the Season Pass in anticipation with the expectation I would be charged an ""episode rate"" but much to my surprise, my credit card was already charged $30.99 by Amazon.com for the entire season which does not start until October 12th...",1411084800,22,251,4.7272727272727275
7133142,5,B00WNBABVC,"My high school age boys and I have been hooked since day one. A great series about the exponential decay of societal norms once routine lifestyles are shattered by disaster. We learn a lot about humanity, ethical choices in light of physical needs, and so much more. These issues come to life during any number of real micro-disasters occurring around the world from hurricane and floods to war zones, etc.",1410998400,16,406,4.814285714285714
7133143,5,B00WNBABVC,"This is an absolutely amazing show in how it handles the post apocalyptic behaviour of an ever changing group of people.  It deviated from the comic books and tells it's own store, and it is a lot of fun to watch.  Characters grow and change, people die, and others are forced to move on.

This season is moving in the right direction with a lot of major changes and new situations.  The group they are stuck with now is going to make this a fantastic season because things are going so badly.  It is very true to life because people don't always make the right choices and things don't always just work out in that fairy-tale way a lot of shows have.

Give it a try. Start at the beginning or play catch up. It is totally worth it.",1410998400,18,732,4.23021582733813
7133144,5,B00WNBABVC,Anxiously awaiting Oct. 12th. Best show ever.,1410912000,,45,5.571428571428571
7133145,5,B00WNBABVC,"What do you say about a show that while professing to be about zombies is really one of the best dramas to hit the airwaves in years.  We follow the adventures of our group while being scared to death not of zombies as much as the fact that the producers of this show have already proven on multiple occasions that pretty much nobody is safe and can be killed off (we assume that Rick is a constant but who knows)

This season is even more stressful than most since the last season ended on what looks to be a hopeless situation and we don't know if we are dealing with cannibals or what.  hang on for the ride because if there is one thing I have learned by watching every episode and that is you really cannot predict what this show is going to do (as evidenced by one particular gut wrenching episode from last season I never saw coming)

Entertainment at its finest and the zombies when you get down to it are not much more than background clutter.

UPDATE:  I was sure they were gonna drag the Teminus thing throughout the first few episodes and to say I am VERY happy they did not would be an understatement, Rick was awesome!

Minor Spoiler:  What about the Samurai sword??? I love that sword!  (and it finally comes home:)  )

Update:  Talk about your stupid villains, once again, they had no idea who they were screwing with and it showed.  I did love Bob playing them for fools with their Bob-B-Q",1410739200,111,1406,4.340996168582375

The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because 6 seasons in, they become harder to judge. Seasons 2 & 3 rate as my favorite two, 5 stars all the way. Season 6 is good (they're all good), but still just takes place between Seasons 5 & 7. So stuff happens and there's drama and people get eaten by ""walkers"" and have their skulls smashed in, but nothing really stood out, or ""popped"" or punched me in the gut just right. Ulitmately, not quite rising to the ranks of previous seasons.",1525305600,,633,4.3277310924369745

7133233,3,B00WNBABVC,The Blu ray case came broken such that it wouldnt close completely. Thats a huge pet peeve of mine. I would say the only saving factor for this season was the long awaited appearance of Negan. Anytime the survivors sit and settle down tends to make for less entertaining season. Hence why season two on the farm and season three in the prison tend to be ranked on the lower side. The cliffhanger at the end was frustrating and seemed to be purposely saved to boost ratings for the seventh season which was a bit of a letdown in my opinion. But overall I still enjoy the show a lot.,1509753600,,581,4.290909090909091

7133245,5,B00WNBABVC,"Look... I am so sick of Walking Dead ""fans"" that moan & complain about every single episode. This show is as close to perfection as you will find out there... and if there is any doubt about that, then exhibit A is Season 6.

The show started great and has improved year after year. For me--an actual fan and not a ""fan""--Season 6 is my favorite. The writing is tight and the performances are award worthy... and, just a quick tangent--speaking of awards: why is a show with incest, dragons and frozen zombies heavily nominated for Emmies and a far more realistic show with regular zombies snubbed year after year? Don't get me wrong--I love Game of Thrones--but it just seems so wrong. Is it cause one show is based on a literary book and the other is based on a comic book? If so, I have to say, at least Robert Kirkman actually continues to write and finish his projects in a timely fashion... ya' hear me over there, Mr. R.R. Martin?

Anyhow... Season 6 is, in my honest opinion, absolute perfection! And if you are, in fact, one of THOSE ""fans"" and all you do is complain... may I suggest you go watch a show you actually enjoy, like Big Bang Theory or some other inane swill, and let the actual fans of TWD appreciate the show we so dearly love. Thanks! Buh-bye and hope this helps.",1507420800,,1288,4.384937238493724

7133249,5,B00WNBABVC,"TWD, you are either all in or all out. I thought about taking a star off for lame or stilted dialogue, but held off. Sometimes dialogue starts going awry and motivations for characters seem goofy. BUT TWD is bigger than all that, and we move on 'til it gets better, right? I'm sure life would be much darker than it is portrayed here, but I like dark. The best episodes are the ones where the characters are searching an abandoned town, house, or building, because that is what life would be like almost all the time. A caveman like existence of hunting and gathering would be life in the after world. I enjoy the conflicts with the baddies that are still alive, but would everyone be bad? There are more creepy people than good people. Now I'm firmly convinced we have too many bad people in today's world, but not like the TWD world where 90% are bad. I like a little bit of realism in my dystopian zombie dramas. Like Z-Nation, I gave up on that one as too goofy.

7133317,4,B00WNBABVC,"Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors have found a new home in the town of Alexandria. The original inhabitants were organised but lacking in steel, not having seen off the challenges experienced by Rick and his companions. Having helped defend the town from threats within and without, Rick finds himself the de facto new leader of the community and has to take action against an imminent new danger: a vast horde of walkers located in a nearby quarry who are on the verge of breaking out and destroying the town. Beyond that, there are other threats lurking outside the walls, a band of raiders called the Wolves...and another, more mysterious group called the Saviors.

The Walking Dead is probably the most frustrating show on television (although it's also traded that title a few times with Game of Thrones in its most recent two seasons). It's beautifully shot, fantastically scored and has an outstanding cast of excellent actors. The writing and characterisation, however, is highly variable and the show's tone can go all over the place, from slightly cartoonish ultraviolence to gritty realism to funny character interactions and back again, often in a very clunky fashion. By far the show's biggest problem, however, has been pacing and structure. The series has had sixteen episodes per season since its third year, which is very generous by modern American cable standards, but it has struggled, sometimes excruciatingly, with filling that time with consistently gripping drama. From its third through fifth seasons, The Walking Dead has made wheel-spinning into an almost admirable art form.

For its sixth year, the show takes a different tack and one that is quite successful in solving this problem. The first half of the season revolves around two entwined events: Rick and his friends driving off a walker horde at the same time some opportunistic scavengers called the Wolves attack Alexandria. This results in a complex, two-front battle which becomes even more challenging when part of the horde splits off and crashes the party in town. This results in The Walking Dead's most action-packed storyline to date, with eight episodes of building tension, drama and all-out warfare. The series has often been criticised for sometimes forgetting there's even zombies around (although that was kind of Robert Kirkman's point, the zombies are merely the mechanism by which civilisation falls whilst he is far more interested in the social dynamics of reconstruction) but that complaint is certainly dismissed this season. The first few episodes of the show have our characters going to war, engaging the walkers in a full-scale, all-out offensive to save their new home.

It's all splendid stuff. The characters get their moments in the sun, Carol and Tara get new romantic partners, someone gives Daryl a rocket launcher and we're reunited with (slightly inexplicably) fan-favourite bit-player Morgan, who finally joins the cast full-time and gives us the possibly the show's most bizarre stand-alone episode in which he learns aikido from a random dude in the woods and his goat. This episode is gloriously insane, makes very little sense and seems to think it's very profound, which makes it awesomely enjoyable (if not quite for the reasons the writers intended). The first half of the season is The Walking Dead at its very strongest and most gripping, even if the decision to ""kill"" Glen and hide his fate for three episodes remains utterly moronic.

The second half starts going a bit wonky almost immediately. The end of the battle for Alexandria sees several characters introduced at the end of Season 5 brutally murdered apparently just to keep the cast costs down, which is less tragic than just annoying. Things pick up with a fantastic Daryl/Rick road trip episode in which they meet a charismatic new character called Jesus and then learn about the existence of a network of other settlements. At this point the show's allusions to the Fallout video game series (which have always been present, if not in the actual setting, then in the general post-apocalyptic tone) pick up as Rick moves from being on the defensive to gaining a view of a new civilisation arising from the survivors, that maybe they do all have a future. Having snatched away the possibility of a cure for the Turn in Season 5, The Walking Dead makes up for it by giving us a sliver of hope that maybe things will turn out okay.

There is, of course, a problem: the newly-contacted settlements are being extorted for food and ammo by a group called the Saviors. The show very nearly does something great here by having Rick and co immediately agree to attack them without actually talking to them first, which is a startlingly ruthless (and strategically unsound) move, and thus instigate hostilities. Unfortunately the series provides a get-out clause by revealing that they're the same group that attacked them earlier in the season (and had to be sorted out by Daryl and his rocket launcher), immediately giving Team Rick the moral high ground. This only increases when we get to meet the Saviours and discover just what a bunch of bad 'uns they are. Even so, the show makes some very interesting dramatic choices, such as having our first major interaction with the group come through a group of ruthless women who have sworn in with them, resulting in an unexpectedly feminist episode where they take Carol and Maggie prisoner and we're waiting for Rick to burst in and save them, but this turns out to be unnecessary because Carol and Maggie know how to take care of business by themselves.

So if the second half of the season falters compared to the first half, at least it's making interesting and original storytelling decisions, deploying its large cast of characters in dramatically compelling ways and keeping things ticking over nicely. And then it really all goes horribly wrong in the finale.

The Season 6 finale of The Walking Dead has been justly reviled by very large numbers of both critics and fans. One of the most interesting things about the Saviors before this point is that they're nasty and ruthless, but arguably not outright evil (their insistence on murdering one person as an example has to be countered with Rick's willingness to murder all of them without even knowing anything about them), and in fact seem to be what Team Rick were on their way to becoming given a few more months. The Saviors have some wins and losses, and seem to be a match for our heroes without totally overwhelming them (as, say, the Governor did initially). In the Season 6 finale the Saviors become psychic super-savants, capable of working out exactly what roads (ut of the utter maze of highways, back roads and side-trails sprawling outside Washington, DC our heroes are going to take and blocking them off expertly, building petrol-strewn barricades in minutes and knowing precisely where our characters will stop to get out of their truck to risk a cross-country run so they can set an elaborate trap. It's the most unconvincing, contrived bit of writing I've seen in years and is embarrassingly stupid. The silliness of this ending takes away from the introduction of Negan, the Saviors' much-foreshadowed leader, played with relish by the always-good Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and really reduces the impact of his ruthless execution of one of our heroes (not that you find out who that is until Season 7).

So the sixth season of The Walking Dead (****) is very nearly the best (and is certainly the best-structured and paced), but then makes a series of writing decisions throughout the season which are needlessly annoying, particularly its reliance on fake-out deaths. But as frustrating as it can be, The Walking Dead can also be, particularly in its quieter moments of just dwelling on the world after the fall, surprisingly atmospheric and thoughtful. The show's never-ending quest for consistency continues",1497225600,,7924,4.997727272727273

I had no words when it was done with me. I am a big supernatural (JW) fan so seeing Negan was a reall buzz......until his character showed his true colours. I honestly have no idea how the hell they are going to get out of this one. This guy is beyond reason and is so effective god I hate him but he is so amazing on screen its not even funny. I have seen cruel in this show many times but this is down right scary!
 I was heart broken at the end and will try to avoid spoilers as best I can even though I am dying to find out what happened. I have a feeling who got it in the end but dreading the answer at the same time. This show kills you because its hard not to lvoe every single character here, even the super annoying ones.

7133414,4,B00WNBABVC,"The very first horror movie I ever saw was Romero's original Night of the Living Dead when I was 8... I had nightmares that night that I still remember every detail of now, 24 years later, and it's been my absolute favorite film of all time since then. So that film has kind of become the template that I measure all other undead, and horror films in general, up to. To me, NOTLD is the greatest horror film ever made... it created the ultimate terrifying concept... the dead coming back to life and devouring the living. This was not only a concept way ahead of its time in 1968, but the style of horror and atmosphere were unprecedented in those days. Most horror films were very tame, even in those days because people could tell ""it was just a movie""... but NOTLD introduced a realism that people hadn't seen before. I know this isn't a review section for NOTLD but I'm going somewhere with this...

Today, the horror genre is OVERFLOODED with zombie films, to the point that the undead are no longer scary, but cute and lovable... which is why SO many zombie comedies are being rolled off the conveyor belt. The Walking Dead is probably the first non-Romero cinema dealing with the undead that gets the idea of the zombie right SINCE Romero's films. They should be dark, bleak, and horrifying stories, but most modern films portray zombies as ""monsters"" that scream and run rather than the reanimated corpses of the living... can you see the difference? A DEAD BODY CANNOT RUN BECAUSE IT'S BONES AND MUSCLES ARE TOO BRITTLE... that's why the more realistic films had them shambling. It all adds to the realism which adds to the fear we feel.

TWD does have one or two... ""drawbacks"" (for lack of a better word). For one, many of the stories start feeling a little too much like soap operas but when you compare them to 98% of the zombie movies that have come out since 2000, it's a WELCOME aspect since the storylines are focusing on.. well, STORY rather than gore overkill. Second, the thing that Romero hit the bullseye with was the fact that ""They Are Us, and We Are Them""... TWD gets that to an extent, but in my opinion goes overboard on the gory makeup and the color scheme... let me explain... the living characters all have colors (clothing, skin, hair, everything), but the undead tend to just have a monochromatic color scheme... grey, white, brown, all cold colors that seem to blend together. So between the color and the makeup overkill, I feel like the show conveys more of an ""Us vs Them"" feeling rather than the more complicated ""Us vs Them... but They ARE Us"" inner struggle.

All in all, TWD is THE best zombie show or movie or book or whatever since George A Romero's Day of the Dead in 1985. Yes the 80s were full of excellent horror of all kinds, but the 90s fell off completely with horror, and when it made a come back in the 2000s, with the exception of indie and non-mainstream horror, the movies focused mostly on gore and special effects instead of character and story.",1489881600,,3001,4.543438077634011

Intro: Something Interesting?!

Outro: LOOK WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK (which we will probably just skip over on the next episode)

I don't understand how this show is as popular as it is.  There are long periods of waiting for something interesting to happen, waiting and waiting, and then there's a brief climax at the end of each season which is thin skipped over when the next season starts.  It's a constant tease of what could be.

It's like eating a corpse that's already picked over.  You'll find bits of flesh that keep you searching those bones for more, but you never quite get a mouthful of that delicious meat.",1487030400,,674,4.630252100840337

7133514,1,B00WNBABVC,"I used to love this show, now its not even watchable. The show began degrading from a show that had well written scripts, intense often unpredictable action to a show where the dialogue is mindless tripe and the action painfully predictable and uninteresting. Now instead of killing walkers the show seems intent on convincing the viewers its ok to kill human beings, and no doubt the youth watching it are learning the answer to all their problems is a gun. Morality of the main characters has completely eroded and there is nothing hopeful, enjoyable or redeemable about the show. Nor is there anything watchable. I've tried watching another episode from season 6 but just couldn't get through it. boring. I am done paying for episodes of this once great show. Whoever the studio executives were that made the decision to fire the writing staff and change the direction of the show were....well....they are cut from the same cloth that decided to have Fonzie jump the shark.",1485129600,,976,4.885542168674699

I just couldn't wait to see what happened to my favorite characters. Once you get past the blood and violence the characters and story-line are addictive.,1484352000,,318,4.696428571428571
7133541,3,B00WNBABVC,"Disappointed.  Kind of like going to the Louvre and complaining that the Mona Lisa is so small, but it is, and so the artistic genius that made this zombie series soar above the genre has become smaller and smaller.  Characters that were essential to the heart and soul of the story are dispatched with a crudeness and shock value that appalled me, given the wealth of talent that is, or was, on board. Fear the Walking Dead, a true piece of crap, seems to have infiltrated the quality and beauty of TWD.  Maybe everyone is tired and wants to go on to other things.  Maybe the effort isn't sustainable.  DaVinci carried his canvas around for years, and even he had to let go of it. But he didn't get sloppy or give her a mustache.",1484265600,,730,4.377777777777778

If they would have ended the season with Carl grabbing his fathers hand during that touching moment it (trying to avoid spoilers lol) it would have been a great season, but then they spin off into some pointless conflict with strangers AGAIN and don't even explain half of what's going on. Makes it hard for you to give a crap about who they are up against and why. Bad way to end the season. You care about what is going to happen to the main characters because we already know them pretty well, but the new guys contribute very little to the season as far as information but the somehow take most of the spotlight???

There are some good episodes and there are some I just never want to see again (the 90 minute Morgan episode???). I have friends who loved 6 and now 7 but I'm just missing something in the way they are now done. The black / white season opener just annoyed me as did the Morgan episode. The Season 6 finale, though, is a favorite overall. It was scary way before Negan made his big entrance.
The ""tell the story"" then flashback, ""tell the story"" and flashback gimmick is getting way old. Hoping they start to just tell the story like they used to. The way they used to flashback (Season 2) was still storytelling. The way it is done now just feels like time filler.",1483056000,3,760,4.212328767123288

7133605,4,B00WNBABVC,"After reading the other reviews, I hesitated to buy the Limited Edition at the original price. When it was on the Amazon Deals for $99.99, I took the plunge. Still slightly disappointed that even at that price, it was the most I had paid for one of these Limited Edition sets, yet didn't do anything special like the other seasons' limited editions. (Two had moving parts, one lit up, and season five at least had a sliding top to access the DVDs in the hidden compartment.) For this, I deducted one star.
As for the season itself, I give it 5 stars. Loved seeing some of the back-story episodes, like how Morgan learned his fighting skills and pacifism, as well as leading up to the season finale. And no, I was not upset at all at the cliff-hanger at the end of the season. I had read the graphic novels and enjoyed seeing the new characters come to life and new communities being introduced, as well as some iconic moments from the graphic novels.",1482710400,,950,4.4655172413793105

What is the endgame of this series?  There is no cure for the zombie blight, so we're basically just watching to see how long these people can survive. No thanks.

7133621,4,B00WNBABVC,"This is a superior show, that I primarily watch not for the zombies but the exploration of how people would likely act in a true national/global catastrophe. That said, I've grown very weary of them killing off major actors. It made sense for 4 seasons, but the problem is that you then can never really identify with the characters - you can't afford to get too attached to anyone. After the season 5 finale, I have not yet decided on whether to watch season 6 or not.

Nevertheless, if you have never seen the show, I highly recommend watching it from the beginning. The first season really made me think about what I would do in that situation. Fine acting, well done series.",1482537600,,678,4.512195121951219

Gore and ultra-violence not withstanding, The Walking Dead is addicting.

The fourth episode, ""Here's Not Here"", was surprisingly poignant and memorable.  Just when I thought I'd seen it all--they quietly surprised me!

My favorite X-Files episodes tended to be the stand-alone stories, that departed from the concurrent theme of the series.  I'd welcome more of these in The Walking Dead.

7133727,1,B00WNBABVC,All the seasons up to number 6 have been good and enthralling.  They have destroyed the TV show by brining in the nonsense Negan and his cronies.  The end of Season 6 and so far all over Season 7 is just Jeffrey Dean Morgan spouting nonsense.  It's crazy.  It has made all the people we view as heros in this series look like weaklings.  It's a terrible terrible low blow to the series.  I guess they want it to end  making the whole of Season 7 almost all monologue from the crazy Negan(Jeffrey Dean Morgan).  What a waste of TV time!  What a waste of a wonderful TV series!  I literally HATE how Season 7 is going... it is destroying the TV show.  What lousy writers and what disgusting acting!

One of the best things of TWD dvd case is the picture of Rick related to what happens during each season; however, the golden cows from AMC decided to give us a cheap ass cover, mostly in black, that does not fit TWD standards, or at least for a fan like me, that like to have everything as good as it could be. That being said, I bought the one from Target, Metal case, Michone and Rick looking over Alexandria, just like in A Larger World comic arc. That is something I recommend to all fans out there. Also, the season is really good, 14/16 episodes are amazing, two aren't that good. This season 7 is pure comic book. This show is getting better and better.

7133779,2,B00WNBABVC,"As a fan of the show, this is not one of the best seasons but it doesn't seem as abysmal as some of the other reviews I have read on Amazon.

 If you still want season 6 wait for a black friday sale when the season is $20-30.  The collector's edition is WAYYY  overpriced.  The retail price has steadily increased, (not talking about resellers) season 2 collector's edition $60, season 3 collectors edition $80, season 4 collector's edition $80, season 5 collectors edition $100 and now season 6 $150.

Season 6 is average, not as abysmal as I have read in other reviews  and it somewhat patterns the comic without completely mimicking it.  The supplemental content and commentaries are average when compared to the previous seasons.  I received this as a gift, I would not have paid $150 for it, it is not worth it.  If you don't like drama why are you watching this show, it's about the people, not the walkers.  How else will you get to know the characters if time is not invested to give them some background and depth.  If the violence and gore  and offends you, I don't understand why you are still watching this show.  There has been plenty of disturbing scenes and scenarios long before this season to drive you away.  The show would become complacent if it was just drama.  Here are some disturbing scenarios and gore that I want to note before you condemn the latest episodes for too much gore and violence SPOILER ALERT:

Season 1 Rick and Glenn wear walker guts to blend in a crowd of zombies
Merle cuts off his own hand to free himself
Amy gets a gory bite from a walker.

Season 2 Dale was gutted out by a walker
Glenn is walker bait for zombie in a well, when walked is pulled out of the well, its entrails spill all over.
Randall gets his leg impaled on a fence, that was nice and visual and bloody
Sofia was put down, it was a very sad moment to put down a child that had been turned in (it wasn't shown but it's a haunting episode just for the character's reactions)
Shane kills Otis in a messed up backstabbing way.

Season 3 Hershel loses a leg,
prison inmates brutally killed,
flu infected people are killed then brutally killed as zombies
Governor out of frustration, shoots his own people, kills Milton slowly
Carl has to kill his own mother in the birth of his sister
Carl puts down another kid
Maggie was nearly raped

Season 4
Hershel is beheaded
Carol puts down Lizzie ( a child)
Rick and Daryl kill the Claimers, when Rick's child is threatened, Rick aggressively responds and bites the throat of another man

Season 5
Terminus folks eat people, they kill them and drain them of blood  like cattle
Cannibals eat bob's leg
Cannibals are  violently killed by Rick's group in the end
Beth gets her brains blown out by a headshot
Noah is squished to death in a revolving door

I won't go into details about season 6

Hundreds of zombies are killed in violent ways....you get my point, if the show is too violent WHY ARE YOU STILL WATCHING?  No one is forcing you to.",1478563200,,2990,4.440366972477064

7133782,3,B00WNBABVC,"Rick Grimes and several of his fellow survivors are imprisoned in Terminus, a society of cannibals. They seek to escape whilst several of their friends, such as Carol, attempt a rescue. At the same time Beth finds herself a reluctant guest of a hospital in Atlanta. Out in the woods, a frightened priest cowers in his church. But the survivors now have a promise of salvation, a cure for the Turn, which calls them to Washington, DC...if they can survive.

The Walking Dead reaches its fifth season, in which everything is awesome and our heroes are happy and smiling. Or maybe not. The season opens with our heroes prisoners in a cannibal stronghold before joining forces with a priest losing his faith and ending with them deliberately traumatising a peaceful community into accepting them as their new protectors. Along the way several major characters die for no immediately-discernible reason and the writers tease the audience with the possibility of some kind of actual over-arching storyline with a firm resolution in mind before snatching it away, leaving both characters and viewers with no hope and to wallow in misery.

Or to put it another way, welcome to another season of The Walking Dead, y'all.

George Romero - someone who knows a thing or two about zombies - once called The Walking Dead a ""zombie soap"". He's not wrong. That's not a criticism, because Robert Kirkman also called the story that of a ""zombie movie that never ends"". Week in, week out, month in, month out, on screen, in the comics and in the video games, people tune into the next instalment of this story which tries to make a strength out of the fact it has no end, no master plan and no planned resolution.

This sense of an ongoing narrative works in soap operas, however, because of the shifts in tone. Yes, characters get divorced, get into fights, occasionally die, but they also get married, fall in love and have moments of real happiness. The Walking Dead's biggest problem has always been its nihilistic streak, that the world is full of misery and pain after the Turn and that both the walkers and other people are dangerous and out to kill you at any given moment and every day is a remorseless, never-ending struggle to feed yourself and your family, to avoid injury and disease, and to find shelter and ammo. Other TV shows embrace the darker side of life, but lighten things with moments of genuine humanity (like The Wire, whose cast The Walking Dead continues to pilfer for new roles), occasional comedy (Breaking Bad) or hope (Game of Thrones). The Walking Dead does this only very, very occasionally, which makes it a harder show to watch. It's the ultimate example of ""grimdark"" on television, with the strengths and weaknesses of that movement.

Season 5, like the past two seasons, attempts to overcome one of its biggest problems - the inability to sustain a narrative over 16 episodes - by dividing the season into two halves. The first half sees our heroes at their lowest ebb in Terminus, but they also have the hope of a cure and an endgame in mind. This ultimately proves a blind alley which is deeply frustrating, but perhaps true to the show's basic premise. Finding a cure for the walkers would, ultimately, feel like a cheap way of ending the series, even if it did provide some kind of upbeat resolution.

The first half of the season is a mixed bag. Our heroes spend way too much time hanging around in a church and the enemies they face from Terminus are characterless ciphers. There's a very half-hearted attempt to inject pathos by suggesting these people were once as good as Team Rick, but turned evil after meeting some bad people. But they never really follow up on it in enough depth to justify the sheer depravities they resort to. This part of the season also makes an ill-considered choice to use fractured, non-linear storytelling, moving from place to place, reversing back in time to fill in back story and accelerating forward again. Non-linear storytelling is a great device when handled well, but The Walking Dead uses it instead in this instance as a way of annoyingly retconning storylines and engaging in cheap emotional manipulation (when Person A was about to die and you thought Persons B and C were miles away, but it turns out in a flashback that Persons B and C were miles away hours earlier, and are now ready to save Person A). It also allows them to pad out the story with filler episodes in which not much happens. The Walking Dead TV show has always been far superior at characterisation than the comic books, and sometimes its use of quieter episodes to expand on character is effective. In the first half of Season 5 it never really works, however.

Once the show returns from its mid-season break, it regains a sense of momentum. Our heroes arrive on the outskirts of Washington, DC (those expecting some great shots of an abandoned Mall won't get them: the show's relatively low budget is never quite as painfully obvious as this season) and find a new safe haven, Alexandria. This results in a much more engaging storyline in which our heroes are presented as the unsafe invaders in a peaceful and stable community, Rick's ruthless pragmatism presented as cynical selfishness and maybe even outright villainy by the existing community leaders. This idea of turning Team Rick into the bad guys has always been an ace in the show's hole and their employment of it is well-assured, accompanied by some excellent performances. However, the show presents even this storyline with the training wheels still on. The revelation of a new group of bad guys who employ tactics far worse than anything Team Rick have done; some of the people in Alexandria turning out to be cowards and murderers; and the Alexandrians genuinely not having a clue about the world outside mean that our sympathies remain firmly lodged with Team Rick throughout. When offered a chance to make a genuinely interesting point on morality, The Walking Dead shrugs and keeps walkin' instead.

Still, The Walking Dead's primary strengths remain intact: some excellent actors, fantastic prosthetics work and some outstanding moments of cinematography and framing of shots. On a moment to moment basis, the show is mostly watchable and there are some outstanding action scenes. Carol (Melissa McBride) remains the best performer on the show, with some brilliant scenes and the opportunity to channel her inner soccer mom in the concluding episodes. She also gets most of the best lines. Many of the other actors also do quality work. But the sense remains that the show needs more of a sense of an endgame and more of a direction to the story. A zombie soap is great fun, there's only so long that it can keep doing that and remain fresh.",1478563200,,6754,4.786449399656947

7133799,4,B00WNBABVC,I love the walking dead. Every year they bring out the Blu-ray limited edition. Season 1 came with a latex zombie mask. SSeason to was the bad ass walker head bust. The head tilted back by the use of a screw driver in the eye socket. The season 3 had the light up walker head fish tank. Season 4 was huge with great detail in the Walker covered in mode against the tree trunk. the head and arm move when you slide the disc book into the back. Season 5 is the melted walker on the pavement. The details are amazing but it's kind of smaller and doesn't do anything for interaction. The new season 6 set is pretty sweet details wise but also is smaller and doesn't have any moving parts for interaction. AMC or McFarland toys were doing a great job but now are making these limited editions more cheaply but charg8ng more money. It really socks that they don't give more to the fans for the price they are charging. still a fantastic show recommend buying and watching but unless your a collector don't waste your money on the limited edition just buy the regular Blu-ray set.,1478304000,14,1073,4.37

Every season limited edition seems to get cheaper quality and cheaper made. This is just cheap plastic, no movement, no sound, no lights, just cheap made plastic. The art is nice but with the cost of this item was excpecting more. I loved the screwdriver zombie head, the fishtank box set...this were unique and fun. With this newest limited edition quality, i am not sure if i will purchase another limited edition version.

Where to start.  I'm very disappointed in the walking deads marketing department for even allowing this product to be sold.  When compared to past Limited/CE versions this was an abject failure.  The fact that the cost of it was actually more then past CE's I am unable to comprehend what my money even paid for.

Strap empty purified water bottles around a normal copy of season 6 and save yourself money.  It really is that bad.",1478044800,6,549,4.484848484848484

7133819,1,B00WNBABVC,"Save your money and just buy the discs. Discs alone are 30 to 40 bucks and this cheesy plastic holder is nowhere near worth the extra $120.00 . I'd say $75.00 - $85.00  for this package  would be a fair price for something that probably costs 15 to 20 to make. It's sad that they would take advantage of people's love for the show. I purchased this one because I have all the rest of them, but I was not impressed at all with the holder especially considering that it's an extra 120 bucks. I have never written a review  before but I had to express my opinion on this highway robbery.",1477958400,16,584,4.196428571428571

7133821,1,B00WNBABVC,"So as a huge fan of the show, I must say I am highly disappointed in the quality of this latest one.  On the first hand they kept delaying the release and obviously doesn't show why.  What your getting is an action figure connected to a display case and that's it.  With the fact that the price keeps going up with the limited edition you would think maybe the quality too!!!!  I will not be ordering another limited edition again!  I guess my collection ends with season six!  Highly disappointed fan!!!!!!",1477958400,79,507,4.516483516483516
7133822,3,B00WNBABVC,"The show is great, as for this ""limited edition"" bundle, it sucks. I own all of the limited edition bundles, they have all ways been very cool in design, allways having hidden things that move or do something. Last season, season 5, the limited edition really let me down, it had nothing special about it, no moving parts or anything, so i figured i would try 1 more season and see if they could redeem themselves with this new one, and they have let me down again. This season and last seasons sets are very small compared to the previous seasons, not to mention they set me back an extra $50 compared to the cooler ones. To sum this up, don't waste your money on this limited edition set, we will see what they have in store for next year but i have little faith these limited editions will ever be as legendary as they were",1477958400,6,826,4.301282051282051
7133823,1,B00WNBABVC,"This is for the limited edition set keep that in mind. The series I give a 5+ . I have every one of these from the season 1 thru this one.

The Limited Edition just arrived and I have to say I am quite disappointed in the quality for the price paid.  It seems they have gone downhill since the intense popularity of the Season 2 Limited Edition and are trying to sucker us in.  I have all Limited Editions since Season 2 - I guess that makes me Sucker Prime #1 - and this is the lowest on the totem pole.  Do yourself a favor and wait a while.  No doubt it will drop to less than half the listed price just like the Limited Edition of Season 4.",1477872000,23,600,4.0423728813559325

7133838,5,B00WNBABVC,"This season was a little slow, but I really liked the character development. I was peeved by -- *SPOILER* -- Beth's sudden death, and was hoping for her character to become more involved with the group, although I initially didn't notice her character much. I was also bothered by how she didn't really mourn her father's death in season 4 and basically just irritated Daryl, but every person is different in how they grieve. I did not enjoy her episodes, but that's my own personal taste. I found the second half of the season a bit tenser and tighter than the first half and I enjoy seeing Rick become a bit unhinged.",1477785600,,619,4.535714285714286
7133839,5,B00WNBABVC,"This is my favorite season to date! I like how a lot of these storylines will continue into the following season, although I wasn't a big fan of the season finale. I understand that the writers didn't want to overwhelm the viewers with a brutal death nor did they want Negan's entrance to be overlooked by the death. But it felt a bit cheap. Plus, it is impossible to keep a secret like a character death unspoiled for 6 months.
  That being said, the best episode (as well as my favorite) aired in this season called ""No Way Out"", and it proves any naysayers wrong who think that the show lost it's direction after season 4. Some very brilliant episodes aired and lots of tension ensued, especially with the mark of Negan. Carol is, in my opinion, the most interesting and complex one in the group and has yet another development in her character that some people won't understand, yet is necessary in order to keep her from becoming too one-dimensional and like a caricature. I thought it made sense that she would eventually have a breakdown emotionally, as she is the one who has grown the most and struggled the most with comprehending her conscious in her actions.
  Great season and I look forward to season 7.",1477785600,,1217,4.568807339449541

7133845,5,B00WNBABVC,"I absolutely love this show, but I almost gave up about 4 episodes in during this season. (I'm glad I didn't) Not that it was too violent or they killed off anyone I cared about, but it had gotten really boring. I understand it's a drama but it was really testing my patience with the 'Beth in the hospital' storyline. The season premiere was great when they made their stand and had an awesome shoot-out against the cannibalistic Termites. I was hoping they'd be at Terminus a little longer, but they made it out in just one episode. The group seeks refuge in Father Gabriel's church where they decide to hit the road and head for Washington D.C.

I like the 2nd half of this season better because they make it to the Alexandria Safe Zone and meet new interesting characters. At first, they are very weary to trust them after everything they've been through. The group is like a pack of wild dogs trying to live in 'Pleasantville' Rick finally shaves his beard and made the new town Sheriff. The people living at Alexandria are so inexperienced when it comes to fighting zombies and making supply runs. The Walking Dead has entered into a new world, and Deanna, the leader of Alexandria comes to realize that the new world is gonna need Rick Grimes.

But, since the time at the prison, the show has shifted away from human against zombie violence to human against human violence. I accept that any apocalyptic situation is likely to produce violent characters, so its not unreasonable story-making.  But, I find human violence disturbing and not entertaining to watch.  Also with this change, the zombies are being reduced to backdrops, mere bothersome gnats to be shooed out of the way as the characters hunt down the next human to kill.  Perhaps such changes are necessary to keep the show from being repetitive, and I know some efforts are made the follow the graphic novels.  So, no complaints, just not my cup of tea anymore.

Well, let me tell you that before the end of the first season, I WAS HOOKED. This show is AMAZING  and I am disappointed that I never knew about it a long time ago. It is not just about zombies. They have made this show so much more than that. It touches your heart, gets you moving with them when they are fighting and will just make you fall in love with the characters and the story alone. It makes you feel like you are there with them, feeling what they are feeling and they are your family that you would lay down your life to protect. It is just amazing. I couldn't wait to get home to watch more episodes and get caught up to where we are now waiting for season 7. In which I am very nervous about because I don't want to see any of them killed but when it happens I know I will be yelling at the TV. I can't believe they are having one of them die. This is crazy. All I can say is that this show cannot end because it is the greatest ever. And to think I am going through withdrawl now waiting for season 7 to start, I don't know what I will do. We have watched other series like this but they haven't even come close to ""The Walking Dead"". It's AWESOME!!!!",1475798400,,1377,3.9532374100719423

7133986,5,B00WNBABVC,"Season Six of the Walking Dead keeps up the pace and the tension throughout the season we've come to expect. It does end on a cliffhanger, but so what?It's a TV series not a movie, unless they never make a seventh season a cliff hanger doesn't matter. You're definitely left wanting to see what happens next. In the sixth season, the walking dead aren't such a problem, especially now that they have the walls of Alexandria.  But Rick has discovered a quarry full of hungry corpses who have been trapped in a bottleneck type scenario.  A truck keeping them trapped on one side is obviously going to fall soon, so he'll need to come up with a plan and convince the Alexandria residents who still don't really realise their life of hot showers and cookies is in jeopardy if they do nothing.  Also like any zombie scenario, the biggest threat for survival isn't from zombies but is from those who are alive.  Season six will have a number of run ins, with various threats.  At times you actually wonder if Rick and Alexandria's residents are actually much different to those who are a threat to them but this group is the way we are vicariously living this zombie outbreak world.

It's five stars for enjoyment although this season has a few zombies who aren't looking as believable as in previous seasons. Obviously less of the budget is being spent on the dead characters. Some look like someone's wearing a rubber mask at times.  There's also on two episodes some editing errors at the start of the episodes, where we see a scene, then we see the same frames repeated in either a shorter or longer with other footage repeat.  Perhaps this is only a problem for the region 4 DVD set but you'd think it should have been noticed.

Region 4's DVD set is across six DVDs.  Nothing but episodes on the first five discs, with the sixth full of special features such as the usual from previous seasons analysis of each episode which goes for over an hour. There's also the usual making of, and a say goodbye to each of the main characters who died.  A few deleted scenes. Quite a few other extras as well.",1475625600,,2097,4.521164021164021

The suspense! I cannot think of another episode where I held my breath so many times. The end was superb, so gut-wrenching emotional, it made my eyes water. (Okay, I admit it..I cried..satisfied?) Of course, Carol and Daryl are my fave characters. Who DOESN'T love Daryl..remember *If Daryl dies, we riot!* (I have been a Norman Reedus fan since Boondock Saints as validated by my 3 ft. framed movie poster.). But if you don't like him..do NOT post it here unless you want a cyber lynching..lol! And Carol is the toughest walker (and other evils) assassin...right up there with Michonne.

7134066,3,B00WNBABVC,I like the action. I like it when they are fighting zombies. But there's not enough of it. Way too much drama. This whole thing is nothing more than a bad soap. I think it would be much better if Maggie and her fake country accent and her Asian boyfriend would die off. I could also do without the sick attempt to include homosexuals in this. It would be nice if Daryll and Rick would man up and clean house of all the weaklings.,1474848000,,429,4.119047619047619

7134088,5,B00WNBABVC,"Delivered quickly! As far as WD season 6 goes, you cannot go wrong with this series. FWD flash forwards in the beginning of each episode make this season a bit confusing at times , and it slows up a bit in parts, but the cliffhanger at the end will have you counting down the days for another year until season 7 arrives for sale!  The latter seasons of this series have less gore and guts than the season 1 and 2, (but still have more gore than most!) and as the series evolves, our band of heroic and not so heroic survivors in this series faces much more danger from other bands of humans outside the walls of their settlement, --(most of them quite brutal),  than they do from the roaming herds of drooling , snarling , rotting, flesh-starved walkers that are always slowly stumbling around that can kill a human in hours with just a bite or a scratch. Central themes are having the courage and stomach to fight, and TRUST--just who do you trust? And whom do you NOT TRUST when you come across other survivors out on the road while doing supply runs? Also do you preemptively do a surprise attack on another band of humans when you have evidence that they may very likely attack you and raid and pillage your settlement,  if you do not do it first? Anyway, have thoroughly enjoyed this series since season one!
If you can get past the gore,  I very very highly recommend!",1474675200,,1375,4.4015748031496065

7134093,5,B00WNBABVC,OMG. This season has left me full of questions and I hate that. I love it BUT I hate it.,1474588800,,88,3.45
7134094,4,B00WNBABVC,"What I've enjoyed most about this series is the amazing cast, and the existential questions raised by the story line, not only about what kind of life is worth living, but what kind of person it's worth being when devastated by loss, surrounded by ugliness, and forced to kill or be killed. By the time we get to Season 6, however, the characters have already met way too many depraved murderers who are not zombies. They've wrung their hands and searched their souls. They've lost those closest to them. They've died to save others. They've beaten back hordes of rotting dead people who, despite being so mushy they are literally coming to pieces, still somehow have the strength to push through walls. Season 6 takes the cycle of zombie fighting and crazy-live person fighting too far. There are too many unbelievably close calls. They are too many truly stupid communities. How many roving bands of vicious ruthless maniacs can anyone reasonably expect to encounter during the same zombie apocalypse? How many zombie invasions can even the most resourceful group successfully withstand? How much hand-wringing would anyone bother to do over his or her lost humanity when the choice is survival or death? At what point would the characters simply stop caring? The show needs to be wrapped up before the characters themselves die of boredom, or it needs to go in an entirely new direction.",1474588800,,1390,4.919148936170213

You can see where it's going each time they make a move till finally, the bottom falls out. Now Maggie's in bad shape, every ones on their knees, Rick's catatonic, again, Glenn 's blubbering, again and the devil is about to deal death. The only bright spot.... not this time. There ain't one. Gotta wait till October 23rd at 8pm. Not my favorite season you might guess. I can think of a few of the group who need whacking, but it probably won't be one of them.

This is a fantastic show that is about so much more than just zombies. The zombies are the basis for the show but This is a series that features incredible characters, some that you love and some that you despise, relationships, growth and change. It shows the spirit that people can have in adverse times,  and the value of the building strong families and family ties, even with those that are blood relatives. This series  puts your life in perspective The comforts that we take for granted every day. The longer you watch walking dead , The more immersed you've become!

7134240,5,B00WNBABVC,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Some shows continue to get better with age. THE WALKING DEAD has become just one of those shows. It could end up stale, with storylines repeated and nothing new added to the mix. Instead it always keeps you guessing, always challenges your emotions and offers one of the best dramas on TV today. While never receiving the kudos it deserves or even being nominated for an outstanding drama Emmy, it is far and above most dramas on TV today.

And let me say that this is a shame. Far too many write this series off as nothing more than a horror story, a show thats all about flesh eating zombies and trying to survive. Those that think this are missing the bigger picture and my guess is theyve not watched more than 2 or 3 episodes. The reality is that while there is the whole zombie apocalypse story going on thats not what the focus of the series is. Its focus is on the people trapped in this situation, how they survive, how they relate to one another and the lives they try to form together in the midst of this situation.

At the end of season five the people of the town of Alexandria were forced to recognize that there are still bad things happening in the world. Theyd grown too comfortable in their enclosure, most never having to confront not just the zombie horde outside their gates but the rest of the world, other survivors like themselves who might offer difficulties in just staying alive. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) has shown them this.

As season six opens the group discovers a quarry filled with zombies that could be released at any time and attack Alexandria. Rick and his group devise a plan to release the zombies and direct them in the opposite direction. And of course something ruins their plan and things begin to get dicey. The zombies eventually attack Alexandria. The townspeople discover that they will have to fight to survive this new world.

But this isn't all that happens during this season. In addition to having to deal with zombies Rick and the people of Alexandria learn there are other groups out their trying to survive. One group is the Wolves, a pack like group that attacks and takes from anyone they find. And entire storyline revolves around Morgans capture of one of these attacks that he shows mercy to. Another group are the people of the Hilltop Colony, a peaceful group that they begin trading with. The worst group though are the Saviors who are anything but. Confrontations with this group culminate in perhaps the most intense cliffhanger of all time, one that has been and continues to be talked about to this day in anticipation of the solution when season 7 begins.

This season also offered something different that stirred controversy as some people enjoyed the idea while others hated it. This was an entire episode that discuss just what had happened to Morgan (Lennie James) after Rick and his group left his compound and before he united with the group. The episode ran longer than most and focused solely on Morgan and how he changed from marauding warrior to pacifist before finding Rick again.

But perhaps the most controversial episode involved the fate of Glenn (Steve Yeun). Episode 3 finds him trapped and surrounded by zombies while atop a dumpster with Nicholas. Unable to deal with the situation any longer, Nicholas shoots himself and as he falls drags Glenn off with him. For weeks the shows producers held us in suspense wondering about the fate of Glenn. No spoiler for you if you aren't aware of the outcome but my guess is by now you know. At the time it was the sort of series item that had people talking for week after week. Was Glen alive or not?

The most suspenseful moment though happens in the season finale as Rick and his group go on a road trip with the intent of ending the battle with the Saviors. *SPOILER ALERT*. The group discovers that the Saviors are a much larger group than expected and end up captured. In the last minutes of the show their leader comes out, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Those familiar with the character from the comics were sweating this moment out. As each member of Ricks group is forced to kneel in a semi-circle Negan informs them that one of them must pay. He brings out a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire and the moment slowly pass as he discusses which of them will feel the blows he intends to inflict. We are left with that in the air, a new discussion topic that has people talking months after it aired and an anticipatory public waiting for season 7 to find out the answer.

A few other surprises can be found in this season but I won't reveal them. Instead give this season a watch. Add it to your collection. Discover why I say this is as much a drama series as it is a horror story, possibly more so. Observe and enjoy the display of acting that this show offers, the special effects that will startle most and the story telling that will pull you in and have you waiting for Sundays each week to find out what happens next. Until then watch the series and enjoy it on disc. You won't regret it.",1473811200,2,5095,4.541394335511982

7134290,5,B00WNBABVC,"Aside from humans having a virus that turns them into flesh eating zombies, the storyline that stands out for me is how the writers juxtapose the humans who are trying to survive together as a community (Rick's group) against the other groups of humans doing the same thing - surviving. Only difference is which group still retains more of their humanity? The living know that the walkers are dangerous and pretty much grow in numbers - but the real monster - the most dangerous enemy is the living - the ones that want to dominate and remain at the top of the food chain. The Walking Dead is the best series I have ever watched ranking in the top with Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Good Wife, Game of Thrones & Homeland. TWD will remain as one of the top cult classics ever!",1473465600,2,772,4.405594405594406

7134296,5,B00WNBABVC,Great! Very timely delivery and packaged well so that no discs were damaged. Really needed to get this one as I had missed the first three episodes of the season as I was working so this way more than makes up for it.

7134309,5,B00WNBABVC,"I won Season 1 & 2 on a Facebook competition. I was immediately sucked into the world of Zombies.
I enjoyed the gruesome, heart-stopping, nail-biting, goosebumps I got from watching it.
Was happy that Fox screened it in South Africa where I watched the rest of the Seasons.
It's not your average Zombie Fest! Watch it and be intrigued...",1473292800,,337,4.728813559322034

7134311,5,B00WNBABVC,"I have a question that has been nagging at me since the first season of Walking Dead. I just finished viewing the 6th season on Blu ray and thought I'd bring up this (probably) tired question of mine: WHY, are there no franchise or corporate names anywhere along the dreary countrysides or even in the cities or small towns from season to season? I have seen minor things like 'goo-goo clusters' shown in season 6 (aren't they a candy staple of The South, and this IS filmed in Georgia). But I'd love to see a deserted or ruined structure that is/was say, a McDonald's, or Denny's, or Starbucks, or Taco Bell, or Ace Hardware, or Safeway Market, the list goes on. Is it because Corporations don't want their properties to be shown in the show, or is it something else? I realize of course this show is all about 'make-believe', but, WHY has there never been any (to the best of my knowledge), big name company featured on the show? I live in a very small town, and there are corporate signs of businesses all over the place. But NOT in Georgia? It would make the show more, I don't know...'realistic' for viewers like me. This is a minor quibble that won't make me stop viewing the show, but I'd still like to know.",1473292800,,1215,4.428571428571429

7134313,4,B00WNBABVC,"The series has covered just about every angle of grotesque violence.  So the carnage for horror barely raises an eyebrow.  In Season 6, what's left is a meditation on Darwin where survival might be totally beholdien to devolution.

Thankfully the gore effects have taken the back seat to good to possibly great performances and some gorgeously constructed scenes with fine editing.  Culminating with the Negan cliffhanger, so I can't wait for Oct. 23rd.",1473206400,,453,5.164383561643835

The acting, the screen shots, how it was put together, the story line...EVERYTHING... just sucked. SERIOUSLY, who ever took over this season killed it.

7134425,4,B00WNBABVC,"First off... I became a big fan of this series over the Christmas Holiday in 2015, where we binge-watched Seasons 1 through 5 on Netflix. Since then, we I picked up Season Six on DirecTV ...  only to find out we only picked up the second half of the season. So, we've been waiting patiently to see this Blu-Ray pop up on the market (or, well, for Netflix to get broadcasting rights to it). This late August, our wish was fulfilled -- however, Amazon's price was over that of our local Best Buy ... so, it was easy to ""just go pick it up."" So, that's what we did...

Excitement was high, opening the box. It was well constructed and laid out, and not one of those prone to scratching the disc every time you pulled it out of the case, or put it back in for storage. So, that's a bonus. However, running this Blu-Ray on a 4k SUHD screen, it's incredibly grainy (perhaps even more-so than just any of our regular DVDs); the quality simply does NOT appear to be even full HD. Incredibly disappointing, in that regard (enough that we are considering trying to return it).

Overall, however, if you just care about the story and catching up prior to the launch of Season 7... obviously, this is your ""best"" choice.",1472342400,2,1208,4.383928571428571

No more with the ""whats that noise in the dark room? Maybe i should go see all by my little ole helpless self"".ugh.make it fresh again.its soooo played already!!! Add some fun now and then.end of world? Ok.zombies? Ok.how about a shopping spree at t iffanys and the mercedes dealership? The survivors ARE still human by the way.also your budget has to be big enough so that you don't have to use computer simulated mass zombie scenes/18wheelers falling into rock quarries. Im sure people would volunteer for free if need be, for those scenes. It looked SO FAKE! Pay attention to the details.your audience is more sophisticated than you seem to think they are.and last but not least, everybody knows you have to stab the zombie in the brain to kill it, so no more neck stabbing.

7134435,5,B00WNBABVC,"I love this show. I think season 6 may be one of the best because of where it goes and how it follows the comic. ::SPOILERS AHEAD::
I love that they introduced the Hilltop, Jesus, Dwight (and giving him a little bit of a backstory and feud with Daryl), how they hinted at The Kingdom, and introduced the Saviors, as well as Negan. Some might think there was a lot of BS with some episodes, like the backstory of what happened to Morgan between ""Clear"" and the season 5 finale. There were some really epic battles in this season. ""The Same Boat"" was a real favorite of mine because of how it centered around female characters, and how they were not to be taken lightly. When I watched the finale, I felt like there was a lot of nothing happening, but after watching it a couple more times, I've learned that there was much more to it. It was building up this moment where Rick's group was going to finally realize they're heavily outnumbered and their confidence was about to be pulled out from under them. The cliffhanger was frustrating, but I understand why it happened, and I can't wait for the season 7 premiere.",1472256000,,1116,4.4487804878048784

My big gripe is that I purchased the DVD set and was expecting to find the uncensored versions of scenes (OK, mostly the big Neegan one in Last Day On Earth because the profanity just takes it up a notch, IMO) had read prior to purchasing that those would be included in both the Blue-Ray and DVD packages.

7134479,5,B00WNBABVC,"The 5th season was my favorite season thus far, however the 6th has definitely matched that, if not succeeded it!  There are a couple of slow episodes this season that were kind of frustrating to watch while the season was on TV, however I think I was so frustrated with them only because the storyline was getting so intense and I couldn't stand to wait a week to see the next outcome!  Some of my favorite episodes are from this season now!  ""No Way Out"", ""The Next World"" - where something happened that I have been wanting to happen since the 3rd season, but never thought actually would!, ""Not Tomorrow Yet"".""The Same Boat"" and ""Last Day on Earth"" - This was the most intense 90 minutes of television I have ever watched.  Not because of any sort of crazy action or weird twist, but because they played up the tension the whole episode.  Every commercial break I had to just breath and calm down before it started right back up again.  The acting was superb (especially from Andrew Lincoln who does not get the kind of credit he deserves from all of his amazing performances on this show), so much so that I could just feel the anxiety, worry, and dread coming off of him.  It made me have knots in my stomach.  I love this show and I have never more thoroughly enjoyed  the characters, the writing, the acting, and the storytelling of any other show.",1471910400,2,1356,4.4574898785425106

7134481,3,B00WNBABVC,"COMFORT ZONES don't exist for the characters of AMCs zombie apocalypse series. There were no comfort zones for viewers in 2016 either. Ratings might have been huge for the finale  17.3 million  but theyve decreased since Season 6. Perhaps because fans don't like being played.

A big reveal promised in previews for the finale was never delivered; it's been saved for Season 7. After an uneven second-half season, viewers rebelled. The outcry has been HUGE.

Producers boast comic book readers have been looking forward to the arrival of new Big Bad, Negan. I found it less spectacular. Negan is just another evil blowhard in love with his own voice. Played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan of Watchmen, Supernatural and The Good Wife, weve seen this before. Do we have to see it  worse, hear it  again?

The first half of TWDs Season 6 is great. Greg Nicotero, master of all things zombie, starts it off with a bang. I kind of went into it thinking it was like a $120-million action movie for considerably less than $120-million, he says in 601 Out of the Quarry, one of six short featurettes.
The multi-episode, multi-perspective story arc has 30,000 extras. No CGI. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), who got an out-of-character Shane Walsh-persona in Season 5, is a hero again. He learns the current refuge has remained untouched because a barricade has trapped a massive herd of zombies. A plan to lure them away must be implemented before its trial run when the creatures escape first.

It plays like the movie it was intended to be. Extended Episode 604, Heres Not Here featuring Lennie James as Morgan Jones, who returns as a full-fledged cast member, is another standout. It co-stars John Carroll Lynch and is one of the series best.

So hooray for the first nine episodes. The other seven begin badly with 610, The Next World showcasing Rick and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus). The comedy approach makes a hash of the characters. They go on a supply run together and, when a truckload is destroyed, they respond with an Oh, well. Thats how it goes attitude. What?!

The next WTH moment arrives via Melissa McBrides Carol Peletier, who suddenly goes pacifist. Through five seasons, the character progressed from a battered wife with a long history of abuse to an empowered champion, able to protect herself and others. Now she deserts her friends. If the change is part of a new story twist, it rings false. Co-executive producer Denise Huth tries to explain it in Strength in Bonds and fails. Where is executive producer Gale Anne Hurd?

No hero likes killing. Carols first triumph came when, Rambo-style, she saves the group from a fortress of cannibals. Early in Season 6, shes a one-woman Assassins Creed, taking on the Wolves, a gang of killers who invade town. So whats with the change? Michonne (Danai Gurira) still retains the title, thank God. But I worry since they're also messing with Daryl. He continues to act out of character in 614, Twice as Far. This man is super-experienced, the groups best warrior and tracker. But his actions all but beg the bad guys to find them. They do, and another new favorite is killed.

Sadly, the five-disc set from Anchor Bay, now owned by Lionsgate, also disappoints. Commentaries promised on the package are missing on disc. They were always among the best features. The featurettes are good; deleted scenes interesting. There is an extended version of the finale, Episode 616, Last Day on Earth if you're up to watching it again. Mini-takes on every episode highlighting stunts and make-up with Nicotero, actors, stunt coordinators and crew are very good. It leaves the impression they still love working on the series.

The 1080p picture is down a few notches from earlier sets, even if it still looks better than broadcast. Color, detail, depth and delineation shine  as usual  among the bonus features. But the overall look of the episodes is fuzzy. Its as if too much film grain has been added to a digital picture. The immersive 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack continues to be excellent, putting viewers in the heart of the zombie rampage, when Daryl ignites a pool of gasoline or sets off a rocket launcher, and other scenes. There are subtle surround-moments, too, found in deep woods or interior sets. Music continues to set perfect atmosphere.

Not all character changes were unacceptable. Eugene (Josh McDermitt) and Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) finally step up. Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) steps down although his one-liners keep coming. Maggie (Lauren Cohan) becomes Alexandras new manager. The ratings drop is barely perceptible in TWDs overall popularity, just enough to notice. I'd rate this 3.5 stars if possible. I hope Season 7 will get us back on target.  Kay Reynolds",1471824000,15,4723,4.905897114178168

7134488,4,B00WNBABVC,"The Walking Dead: The Complete Sixth Season begins with Alexandrias safety shattered by multiple threats. The people will have to toughen up while many of Ricks followers will need to take a step back from the violence they had needed to embrace. These reversals won't happen easily, or without conflict. But now Ricks (Andrew Lincoln) group is fighting for something more than survival  they're fighting for their home, and they will defend that at any cost, against any threat, even if that threat comes from within.

The first half of Season 6 deals with an approaching zombie herd and an attack by a rabid band of maniacal predators called the Wolves. Overlapping story lines focus on different characters during the crisis. We also learn Morgans (Lennie James) back story to understand what motivates his no-kill personal code. The second half of the season portrays the survivors as darker and far less moral than in previous seasons, posing the dramatic question, Are these people heroes? The later episodes suggest that a major character has died, for a gotcha cliffhanger.

Bonus extras on the 5-disc, 16-episode Blu-ray release include deleted scenes and several behind-the-scenes featurettes. A digital HD copy is enclosed. Season 6 is also available in a 5-disc DVD edition.",1471824000,4,1286,5.143540669856459

So it was that, in a moment of boredom, I tuned in to a repeat of the first episode of the first season. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Although the violence is hilariously gratuitous, graphic and gross, the story line, acting and character arcs are unexpectedly engaging. I found myself wanting to see more after each episode. And so it has been that I have been watching, in my spare time this summer, this over-the-top, under-my-radar, extremely gross and completely engrossing TV show.

Was afraid to take on something scary but it was done in such a classy way that I soon began to see the 'feared ones' as more of a metaphor. The quality of the writing, the production value, is consistant throughout all seasons, and quintessentially Frank Darabont. These very skilled actors are given real scenes to play, and they are all so unique. Andrew Lincoln seemed like he went way out of his comfort zone and deserves a lot of credit for the success of this series. I felt like I literally watched him grow as an actor.  Loved the diversity of the cast and that they take chances on newcomers whose 'star value' didn't destract me from the story. It tackles some BIG themes and actually changed the way I look at life in so many ways. Can't imagine anyone not taking stock of their life after watching this transforming series. I see now why it has such a loyal fan base. Can't wait for Season 7, and I hope they make it go on forever! I just started rewatching Season 1 and seeing so much more that I missed the first time.

I won't give any spoilers away, but there are a couple of things the creators could have done differently involving a fake-out death scene.

7134594,5,B00WNBABVC,Possibly the greatest season so far. Character development continues to show by the beloved cast members and their characters. Surprises arise throwing new curve balls at Rick and his family which do and do not work out on their favor. Much is changing in new enexpected ways and the producers deliver another amazing season of TWD that has us eager for next October to arrive with the newest season to give us answers.,1470787200,,419,4.7534246575342465

7134596,5,B00WNBABVC,"I didn't start watching The Walking Dead at first because Zombies didn't really do anything for me.  When they had the weekend marathons last year I thought I'd give it a shot and see what all the hype was about.  After watching the first few episodes, I was hooked.  It's not ""all"" about Zombies.  They play a big role but it's mainly about survival in a hostile world and the relationships between people who have to depend on other people to survive.  The actors and acting is top notch.  It does get a bit bloody at times but it enhances the plot, so it doesn't bother me all that much any more.  I'm 65 years old, so I'm not a kid.  Each season has been great and there are episodes that I like better than others, but even the slow ones give you background on the characters, so I don't mind that.  If you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely give it a shot, but try to watch it from the beginning otherwise you won't understand some of the things that are happening between the characters.",1470787200,,1005,4.331550802139038

Since Season 6 is ONLY available on Amazon, I was forced to purchase it here.  First their entire server went down on July 29th, a Friday, so we were unable to watch.  No compensation either BTW. Now tonight we're receiving an ""insufficient bandwidth"" error. Something that NEVER happens with NF.  Get it together!!!
You cannot compete with Netflix and I don't think we'll be watching anymore Prime videos.  Extremely disappointed.  Not like the Amazon I know and love.",1469923200,2,561,4.742268041237113

What consequences will come to the group? Should we kill or should we not kill? The season rolls on to all the moral dilemmas and decisions made  will come at a cost. Rick leads them into battle and they come out victorious. His confidence in the community is restored..but his decision of killing another group could have deadly consequences.  For every thing there is a return, either good or bad. The group now must battle with other groups and a much larger and ruthless group called Negan. The last episode unwinds and they find they are outnumbered and outmatched...how will they adapt to this new group called Negan? This season was good, but I believe next season will be even better. I've liked the storytelling in this show, the moral dilemmas, the camera work, and most of all the characters and the zombies look really realistic. Most people didn't like the last episode in season 6. I liked it and here's why...The show does a great job at making the viewer feel exactly how the characters feel in the show. I felt at the end of the last episode hopeless and in despair and yes torture because we have to wait to see who Negan killed. I first hated this, but now the storytelling will begin with season 7 with a lot to offer..can't wait!",1469923200,3,1403,4.559523809523809

7134787,3,B00WNBABVC,"Overall this season really sucked, mostly because it was so frustrating. So many great story telling opportunities wasted. It was also extremely frustrating to watch piecemeal (might not be as painful if you binge watch it). I liked the first 5 seasons overall, but this season the show really lost its way. There were so many potentially great directions they could have taken the story. I thought that the first episode of the season was a real barn burner and looked forward to the rest, but I was sorely disappointed. So many cheesy plot gimmicks, so many random episodes that were just stupid and boring. So many potentially exciting story lines not followed. I thought the whole season was going to be a big adrenaline rush just following the obvious plot setups from the first episode. Instead it wandered off and left us with a very unsatisfying end to the season. I really don't like how the story is becoming more and more like the comic book. I guess the whole thing is based off a comic book, but the earlier seasons seemed more like a survival story, whereas by the middle to end of this season it feels like you are reading a goofy comic book story. Oh well not sure I will invest in the next season. Especially since the show appears to be going completely comic book and focusing on the ridiculous new bad guy.",1469577600,,1326,4.57563025210084

I thought this series was just another mindless zombies show ... it is not; it's about survival in a post-apocalyptic world. It's very well produced, written, cast and directed ... accented beautifully with the country scenery/backdrop, all the greenery, woods, winding roads, changing landscapes, etc. I absolutely love the all main characters, even with all their flaws, which is what makes them work so well together. I love their loyalty and commitment to each other and to Rick ... and I look forward to their adventures, trials and tribulations. I absolutely love this show.

7134930,3,B00WNBABVC,There were some great episodes during this season. The last episode of the season really annoyed me I'm wondering if they are running out of ideas? We will see in Season 7. There were a few terribly stupid characters that met their bitter end at the expense of the characters that seemed a little more prone to common sense and long-term survival. I do hope AMC hires a good team of script writers moving forward I don't want to see this flop like fear of the walking dead has so far!

7134978,4,B00WNBABVC,"I want to give 5 stars but I can't.  I love the series, and have since season 1 but the human on human drama and violence is getting to be too much.  Dealing with the walkers is secondary to dealing with some evil group of humans that are trying to get at what Rick and his group have. I'm over the drama of good versus evil.  Get back to dealing with and surviving the zombies being the main threat.

To the makers of the show:  Stop with the drama of good people versus bad people (you have the walking dead as perfectly good opposition) .  Change it up.  Don't follow the path of other shows which tend to escalate the human drama season after season until it's impossible to out drama themselves any longer. If the next season tries to out drama this season I will not be able to tolerate the show any longer.",1468540800,,813,4.2064516129032254

I'm still a little bit sour over the epic, and likely most anticipated event cliffhanger thus far-especially for those of us who enjoy the comic.  I'm pretty sure I know how this all ends up, but I guess there is always that very SMALL probability that Gimple will throw us off trail.  Never know with that guy, lol.

I just rewatched ""Last Day on Earth"" the other night searching for Easter Eggs and anything I may have missed during the first viewing.  Another great season (with a few not-so-awesome bottle episodes inbetween), with a few totally amazing episodes.

SO ready for Season 7.  Come on OCTOBER!",1468454400,2,665,4.584745762711864

7135038,5,B00WNBABVC,"I was late discovering ""The Walking Dead"" because I just couldn't envision myself liking a show about zombies. It just sounded too silly.  However, I finally, with reluctance gave it a try, because it had such high star ratings. Also, I knew it was a wildly popular series with several seasons.  To my surprise, I loved it!  A good show can be about almost any topic.

The writing is consistently top-notch.  Every season is as good or better than the one before.. The story is presented in such a way that makes it easy to suspend reality and imagine that it is really happening. The characters are diverse, well fleshed out, and interesting. Despite their flaws, (which make them seem like real people), I found myself really caring about most of them.  The writers were always coming up with imaginative new developments.  Somehow, they  managed to end each episode in a way that  made me impatient to see the next one.

I watched the first 5 seasons on Netflix and purchased season 6 from Amazon.

As can be expected, this show is not for young children or people squeamish about television blood and gore.",1467936000,,1110,4.670103092783505

7135049,2,B00WNBABVC,"This used to be one of the coolest 'binge watching' series out there, but the episodes are getting harder and harder to sit through without cringing and scratching my noggin wondering 'why bother', this season in particular ...seems like the writers are playing out the same old scenarios we've seen over and over already. Also, the kid in the cowboy hat gets shot in the eye, next episode, he's fine. The funny doctor lady gets an arrow through the eye, she dead. Seems to me the writers are desperate for plot thickener, but what comes out is dumbly dramatized and sort of insulting. It's hard to get a sense of the bigger picture (where the show is heading), and it seems like the writers are trying to eek out every last speck of boring drama before a conclusion is depicted ...which is unfortunate, wish it felt more about the integrity of the story, less about making money for the crew and cast.

It looks like a lot of folks gave this season positive reviews, to which I say again ...it totally SUCKS that ""entertainment"" is the overpaid and glamorized influential institution that's too much dumbed-down to meet the lucrative expectations of the least and lessoning of us.",1467849600,,1181,4.705314009661835

What I can tell you is that the characters will all nod to each other several times an episode.  There will also be a heartfelt thankyou from one character to another.

Also there will probably be a point where you say, ""wow these are now all bad people"".

The show probably should have ended last season.",1466467200,,530,4.402061855670103

ByDahlgrenon March 30, 2016
Format: Amazon Video|Verified Purchase
After Season 5, which can only be described as the purest possible distillation of the heart of The Walking Dead, Season 6 returns to the lackluster soap-opera seen in prior seasons. The attention to detail has suffered. The writing has suffered. A few characters seem to completely betray what we have come to know as their true selves.

Don't get me wrong, I'll keep watching. I'm a die-hard fan of the series. Just don't expect the same hard-hitting, breathtaking, complex layered storytelling we got last season.",1465862400,,703,5.157894736842105

7135360,5,B00WNBABVC,Gotta say Season 5 episode 1 is possibly the best program of the entire series.  The realization that the folks at Terminus have gourmet motives and the feeling in the pit of your stomach that the softball swinger is going to cap one of the group.

Binge watched all six seasons.  There were parts of season 6 I really enjoyed but I found myself missing time with our main characters and their relationships, i.e. maggie and Glenn and all of them together.  I think Rick definitely let his false confidence jeapordize the group's safety and I wanted to shake Carol. I am really afraid to find out who fell victim to Lucille.

While the zombies are key, the real story is how humans would act in a situation where most of civilization is lost and everyone still alive is fighting for life. The characters evolve and adapt to the situation and it's what makes the series so fascinating. I've binge-watched seasons 1 through 5.

7135400,5,B00WNBABVC,"This season was full of ups and downs. I was on the edge of my seat the entire season. I keep waiting for major characters to be killed off and I will be so upset if they are. The main characters are what makes this series.  I do feel like Carol has became one huge cry baby. I just want to smack her with all of her whining she done on season 6. I also must admit that I didn't shed a tear when Sam died at the beginning of season 6, that kid was annoying! I kept telling my husband with every episode that we watched that there was just a lot of talking this season. I am more of an action person! I know sometimes talking is necessary in order to tell a story but when you get into a series such as this, you really just want action all of the time. Carol was such a strong woman through the other seasons and all of the killing has gotten to her but they have to in order to survive. I hate that Carl ended up with a missing eye but glad to see Rick & Michonne hook up!

I enjoy characters that you can sympathize with and rally behind and WD has several such characters.  Excellent casting and great plot twists.

I want them to be careful with it and for it to make sense to the story. I want to feel all the emotion of it so there needed to be a build up to it and they did that!

7135486,5,B00WNBABVC,I hate the blood & gore. But the possibility of some type of Apocalypse is possible. I like the plot that shows the relationships of the characters; good and evil.

7135526,1,B00WNBABVC,"Very, and I mean, very disappointing. Apart from the love relationships between Rick and Michonne, and the interesting one between Carol and Morgan, the script, storyline, direction and acting are the weakest they have ever been. And the end, please, how lame, silly, and unbelievable can you get? It very much looks like the producers are trying to 'sell' another season, hook the audience with yet another cliffhanger.

7135529,5,B00WNBABVC,"A must have if one is expecting the zombie apocalypse.

I look for myself in the characters and wonder who I would be in a zombie apocolypse?  Who would I trust?  How would I spend my efforts and my scarce resources? How would I replenish them?  How would I protect my ""stuff and thangs"", and how would I protect loved ones?
Now as the story progresses I see that ""Who would I be?"" is the wrong question. ""Being"" is stagnant and doomed. The question is ""Who would I become?""  I SURE AS HELL DON'T KNOW!  That's why I love joining in on this group's search for its place in an evolving new society.",1465084800,,661,4.421487603305785

7135533,3,B00WNBABVC,"Every season seems to be getting slower and going farther downhill. Too much filler and not enough movement plagues 90% of the season.

I am thinking about re-writing a little grand finale in my head where they are all smacked about by the Negan folks just for being tactically and strategically stupid and turned into zombies.

Except that in this season most of the terror comes from fending off the living rather than the dead. We see the same group keep trying to survive and still make huge blunders that make you wonder whether they should be offed for the better of the show. Lots of violence, death and no redemption.

The part I like best is that the show is not only about zombies, it's also about relationships, loyalty, trust, etc.  I did not watch the show when it started, but someone told me to give it a try since I like these kind of shows and season six was already running.  Once I started I got so hooked up that I watched all six seasons one after the other, a total of 88 episodes.  Now that I finished I can't wait for season seven to start in October.  If you like vampires, werewolves and zombies you will definitely like this show.  Is a must watch.",1464825600,,704,4.2481203007518795

Uncharacteristic behavior and forced plotlines that seemed gimmicky, only serving to bring about the rushed, over-hyped season-finale-that-wasn't. The Miracle Dumpster was the worst. I've been hooked on the show since catching season 1 in a marathon a few years back, so I'll keep watching the series...but it's not must-see TV anymore.  Sad face.",1464825600,,433,5.352941176470588

The character that surprised me the most this season was Father Gabriel. He was a backstabbing, ungrateful, whiny, judgmental creep in season 5 it was good to see him step up. I continue to dislike and not give a crap about the character of Enid.

I think you should think new situations, new communities, interesting alternative situations such as a murder inside the group, alien, supernatural, etc... Also the walking dead should stop being there at some stage as they can't roam around without nutrition indefinitely.

7135788,5,B00WNBABVC,"There is nothing more interesting than this show. I watched all six seasons in 2-3 weeks. Was worth every second. This season, especially, because it has a lot of character development, and a lot of stuff going on within the show. I would've like to have seen more story progression in terms of more information about the virus. Things like how it infected everyone, or why it infected everyone, but I know the story writers are not going to just release the ""goods"" because I think it would take some added value out of the show. But, they could take a different approach and started talking about the walkers, like research on them as an opponent, such as how long can they live without food, what kind of decay occurs during that time, MORE about why they walk in herds rather than just because of something simple like sound, etc. I really love the show because of the character development, but every 4-5 episodes, it wouldn't hurt to put like a 2 minute skit explaining more about things, give us some of the science-y stuff behind it. That makes it a little more interesting than just ""aim for the head"" ...",1463702400,,1114,4.54726368159204

The Walking Dead  is an obsessive movie with exciting unexspected twist and turns literally. It's a tragically hearbreaking story of bravery, survival of the fittest and some luck. I'm hooked. Find myself rooting for the ones that remain alive with their souls bruised but intact. While being lucky enough to still be alive and human, the ignorant ones or groups rob and kill for personal gain. I'm disgusted with their ignorance and patiently waiting for karma. If you don't have compassion, stick together to increase mankind, the zombies will multiply ending in the demise of all mankind.  Because it's real men, women, children and families brought together and or torn apart  by the death of their loved ones who will now become a zombie the undead.

7135864,5,B00WNBABVC,A must watch show!,1463184000,,18,3.75
7135865,1,B00WNBABVC,"When the series first started, I thought it was about time someone set about a serious look at this zombie phenomenon and what exactly that might look like in the long term. Everyone seems to focus on the first few days and this had promise. Season 1 was funny, clever, and somewhat realistic. People would be stupid, they wouldn't know how to deal with the new reality. But then season 2 came along and it became this running joke of ""what you should NOT do in the apocalypse"". Failure to set up protocols, properly think about sustainable resources, interacting with strangers etc. It became unintentionally amusing.

But now season six. Here we see magic. Magical bad guys. These people are so dedicated to being evil that they become two dimensional characters. Unbelievable evil spawning with people so DEDICATED to embodying that evil that they'll do anything to continue to be evil, including die for it. That seems to defeat the purpose, since the show just seems to be about the struggle of survival and how much of your humanity you're willing to give up for it.

Then come the hostage scenes. Oh jesus. I'm tired of seeing Rick's Crew be held hostage. They're ALWAYS being captured. It would be one thing if they had adapted and had started learning how to hold out small knives and stuff so they MEANT to be captured, but they don't. The drama is a cycle. Rick and his crew leave the walls, MAGIC BAD GUYS by the billions sneak up to right behind them and put a gun to their head. They NEVER hear them coming, even their hillbilly scout is routinely snuck up on, like watching Worf get beat up over and over again.

And the sheer number of this evil gang nation is ridiculous. They have the ability to block EVERY ROAD with increasingly more bad guys. Sacrifice men in an ambush where they just shoot at their feet, all for the purpose of breaking their spirit when all they needed to do was surround Alexandria with some of that big equipment and some of those MILIONS and MILLIONS of men they're somehow feeding by killing and raiding scavengers and small farms (logistic problem here). It all seems contrived to do nothing but humiliate and torture Rick's group.

If I'd been him, I'd have reacted to the situation that they'd been facing. The bad guys are numerous and somehow operate as if walkers didn't exist. They sneak around the woods looking for people they can bring into their fold or kill. We'd carry that RPG with us everywhere and those displays of force would be big explosions and body parts in seconds. If the enemy has the capacity to overrun us at any moment and kill every one of us or enslave us, then they'd better do it already because if they keep presenting me targets, I'm going to shoot them.

Instead it just seem to be a pissing contest with Rick, who eventually loses. So what's the theme of Walking dead? If the end comes, having any sense of humanity or justice is a sure way to be humiliated, beaten, enslaved and eventually killed. Oh, but being evil is somehow bad too. Even though the obvious paradox of being ruthless and evil that has played itself out throughout history is somehow not present here. No infighting, no devastating civil war as evil guy one and two duke it out for control of said evil empire, just a unified front of evil people willing to die to be evil rather than change their ways and live. Highly organized and high functioning bad guys in a world gone mad.

And what about the zombies? They're a backdrop. Sure, you COULD have a show about how zombies make it harder to farm, get clean water, get supplies, or even be MORE creative and move past zombies to something else, but instead we're left with making humans magical and teleporting them around in front of the ""good guys"" until... I don't know, it's thematically acceptable for them to jump out and yell ""boo""???",1463184000,4,3844,4.579941860465116

It may be based off of a comic by it stands on its own. It is is own show. Completely original. There is nothing else like it. It is riveting.

7135913,5,B00WNBABVC,"In my opinion, this was the best season thus far of TWD. Each episode felt like a finale with the plot twists, character development, introduction of new characters with appropriate cliff hangers and just the right amount of ambiguity to make you want to learn more about them. I purchased each episode at a time, because I wasn't sure if I would be interested enough to watch the entire season. Boy was I wrong. Next time, I'll order the entire season all at once and save myself a few bucks. Highly recommend to all fellow TWD fans and soon to be fans. It's a show that is not only about zombies - if that were the case it would not have lasted this long or held this much growing interest. It's about imagining a post-apocalyptic world - whether that came about by disease, nuclear war, famine, etc. and learning how to survive without laws, government, police, or any type of old world civilization for that manner. It's a conflict on many planes. Man vs. Zombies; Man vs. Nature; and most ominous: Man vs. Man. It is a true testament of man trying to maintain morality, civility, ethics and values when other groups they come across do not share the same POV.",1462924800,,1164,4.521327014218009

7135932,5,B00WNBABVC,"I never liked horror movies, zombie movies, and the like. I found them disturbing; not the way that makes me check under my bed at night, but I just found them to be too creepy and too gory.
A friend of mine pleaded that I really should give the show ""The Walking Dead"" a chance...so I did...
Was I disturbed?? Definitely..!! Creeped out to no end..??? Absolutely..!
BUT...I started becoming really enthralled with the story, and eventually even became somewhat ""numb"" to the icky, scary zombies that are awkwardly limping and shuffling around everywhere, with their most disgusting signature-snarl...
The story about the different groups (or sometimes just a single person) of survivors is absolutely gripping. Rick Grimes, Carol, Maggie & Glenn, Daryl, Hershel, Michonne,...they all quickly became ""my family"" for whom I rooted, feared, felt proud, and/or cried in grief.

This show truly is absolutely terrific, and I am so glad that I listened to my friend and gave ""The Walking Dead"" a chance. It unreservedly earned it.
Now I'm suffering withdrawal until the next season comes out...",1462838400,3,1089,5.083798882681564

7136048,3,B00WNBABVC,They seriously need to fire all of the writers and start fresh. I'm so tired of the filler episodes they throw in to stretch out the forced suspense the writers come up with. It's insulting to try and keep viewers by threatening to kill off the characters that make the show tolerable. Write a real story and stop having people behave in erratic ways that conflict with their nature just to get from point A to point B.,1462147200,,419,4.384615384615385

The relationships the character's have built amongst themselves as survivors in a cruel, relentless world has me building my own relationship with them. It is highly violent, and I think, as we can ascertain by the season finale, all character's live in equal peril. I love zombies anyway. Zombies are my thing. However, as others have said, this is not a show about zombies. This is an adaption on how to carve out friendships and the healthiest possible survival mechanisms in a world that refuses to allow this. Some episodes are slower than others. I have found, though, when I rewatch these episodes they, dramatically & artfully, have a lot to offer to the viewer.
  I just do not think the actors should be allowed any time off. I want to see TWD all year round. How dare they make me wait until October! I had to take up reading the comic to get my fill.",1461888000,,968,4.463276836158192

What does an actor do to get fired and banned from Hollywood permanently?

Season 6: Episode 16:

48:35...............I wonder if that guy got fired? Remember the remake of Night of the Living Dead? At the end, at the bonfire? There was one girl actor in bib overalls who was ""hogging"" the camera so bad that they had to send in a P.A. out of costume to yank her out of the shot. Do you see what this guy does? Hey, AMC, Greg Nicotero? anyone? You better check that guy; he's offensive!

7136118,2,B00WNBABVC,"The format of this show is getting so tiresome.

Let me walk you through it..

- meet new people/establishment (good or bad)
- zombies attack
- things calm down
- cue the piano... time to talk, time to heal, time to reflect. ""you're just running away from yourself dag nabbit""
- back to the action
- our long time heroes find a place to hide.. that was intense!
- cue the piano... time to talk, time to heal, time to reflect. ""you're not a bad person you're just a murderer dag nabbit""
- back to the action, zombies finally break down the walls/barricades
- a hero returns to the establishment guns blazing... just in the nick of time!
- One of the main new characters for the season dies in dramatic circumstances
- oh and Glenn will survive that thing you thought he was dead meat...hahaha..  Maggie is elated once again
- Throw in some trickster time lapsing exposition
- and mix it with the occasional backstory episode

You have AMC's ""The walking dead""

now REPEAT formula for next season.",1461801600,,995,4.5055555555555555

7136261,4,B00WNBABVC,"I absolutely love TWD comic. The show however is starting to slow for me after 6 seasons. I am glad it doesn't follow exactly long with the comic, but it seems to suffer from too many episodes that are mere filler. I know they all can't be action packed, but there should be something in every episode that at least keeps my attenrion. The saving grace for this season was the last episode that is way I gave it 4 instead of 3 stars. Now that Lucille is throwing her weight around. I hope total war is as exciting in the show as it was in the comic,but I have been disappointed before.",1461283200,,585,4.185840707964601

7136264,3,B00WNBABVC,"I liked the whole season until the last episode.  How bad was the last episode?  I may not buy it next year.  Neegan's speach went on forever.  I scrolled forward and then more.  For a well written show, this type of ending was insulting.  Twelve minutes of a 65 minute show.  18.5% of the entire show.

Here let me help.  Our protagonists do things that don't fit in character, and they get caught by Neegan's henchmen.  Neegan says he controls everything.  He rules through fear.  Neegan beats somebody, maybe to death.  There.  It could have been done in 42 minuites.  Neegan's speech is entirely superflous, unless it's the first episode you've ever watched then you'll probably figure out the theme before 3 minutes is up.  Did they jump the shark?  Perhaps.",1461283200,2,763,4.702290076335878

7136378,5,B00WNBABVC,"This seasons gives you exactly what you would expect from the Walking Dead. It's shows how the characters are faced to do things they wouldn't have done during their normal life, but have to do now to survive. This is one of the more incredible shows that extremely depicts how these characters change throughout the 6 seasons. What they're faced to survive, who they lose, the people they meet and trying to find a safe place for their group/family. This season was one of my favorites by far. The characters have already changed so much to get to this point that you almost don't recognize who they were in season one. And honestly I wouldn't expect to from what they went through. Some are extremely closed off and can't accept the new place they're in. Some are happy to be there. And some act dangerous. This season will not disappoint.",1461024000,,841,4.613333333333333

7136397,4,B00WNBABVC,"I loved the way they did the first half of the season, taking place over the span of days. It had some hits and misses, but overall I think it was masterful, and great experimental storytelling. The only ""speedbump"" was another truly excellent episode ""Here is Not Here"" which filled in the blanks of a favorite characters return and how he got from where/who he was to the present, more or less. It just felt out of place given the rest of that half of the season.

The second half was far more traditional storytelling with the best episode of the season (and one of the best of the series IMO), 'The Same Boat' and sets the stage for a major characters' moral dilemma that lasts through to the end of the season. They also introduced one of my favorite comic characters in a very ""light"" (for 'The Walking Dead') episode as we see Ricks outlook after the events from the action packed and stellar second half premier 'No Way Out'.

Where things went off the rails for me, at least, were the final 2 episodes of the season. The ""non-cliffhanger cliffhanger"" ending of the second to last episode of the season; 'East' (likely due to fan complaints over a plot line from the first half of the season, which is why ""Screw the fans."" should be rule number one when producing a show like this. Not as in ""don't appreciate them"", but as in ""story comes first, don't cater to fans or engage in fanservice) as a great possible cliffhanger from one episode to the next is blown in a bizarre ending with bad CGI blood-splatter and a line of dialogue in a blacked-out screen that seemed obviously added in post-production so fans of a certain character wouldn't go apoplectic after the first half-seasons' controversial (and IMO great) character's storyline.

The Season Finale itself was stolen by Jeffrey Dean Morgan after a too drawn out and meandering (but effective, it just lasted too long) tension build-up. I can't wait for the uncut version of his speech on Blu Ray. As for the cliffhanger... I have mixed feelings. I knew going in that THAT part of the scene was unfilmable for TV and would likely be POV, which was the best choice, IMO. It was the not revealing who was ""it"" that irked me. I think the fact of the ""New World Order"" and total change of power being established was enough of a cliffhanger for me that who was ""chosen"" could have and SHOULD have been revealed. Those last 2 episodes lose the season 2 stars. Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Season Finale saving, and truly brilliant episode stealing 10-15 minute non-cutaway scene added one star back.

7136423,2,B00WNBABVC,"I used to be a Die Hard Fan of this show, but no more. Beware - there will be spoilers as I rant. I fully admit it's a rant. A long rant.

Season 6 took basically everything good about the show and ruined it: plot, character arcs, and most egregiously the impact of the death of beloved characters. Show runners used manipulation and contrived everything from ridiculous character behavior to ""cliff-hangers"" that went nowhere. Glen's close call became a joke. Then he was surrounded and nearly died again mid-season with another unbelievable save. Nail biting episode endings that never went anywhere sapped all impact from the show: Rick surrounded by walkers as he approaches RV - next episode and he's ahead of the horde nearing Alexandria's gates. Another episode ended with an ominous ""help"" over the walkie talkie. Next episode...whatever...at some point we see that it was Eugene but not in any kind of meaningful way. Sam calling out for his mom while they are walking through the herd is how the mid season finale ends. Well, we all KNOW that there will be repercussions to that right? Nope. Mid season premiere skips that entirely and sets up a whole new opportunity for Sam to doom himself. Daryl is shot with blood splattering the camera lens at the end of an episode. Oh NO! Oh wait...yeah, no biggie...next time we see him he seems fine. We never actually find out whether he is or not...a little blood on his shirt and he seemed tired...by the time they let us know, if they do, I won't care.

Show runners manipulated viewers throughout the season and every single time, they lost any impact an event might have had. Had Glen escaped in the episode immediately following the one in which we were left hanging, I'd have been interested in his fate. But waiting 4 weeks - and the obvious audience manipulation in that decision - made me not only get irritated at the show, but it made me not care by the time we found out. If there's a cliffhanger now, my reaction is: Well, no reason to care. It either won't be addressed at all going forward or it will take so long to get there that I won't care anymore.

In addition to the cliff-hanger frauds, the characters went from interesting, street-savvy survivors to people wandering around stupidly with contrived motivations and zero story impact. Daryl seemed like a main character in two episodes. Two. And in those he was not given the kind of material the character (or the actor) deserved. In other episodes, if he was there, he was completely out of character. Just how many times do you think sure-footed, expert tracker/hunter Daryl - who knows damn well what the stakes are - is going to get ambushed by a bunch of dudes creeping in the woods?

And Carol - what have they done to Carol? She has been a great character played by a wonderful actor and the recent changes to her story arc have been so contrived and ridiculous that I'm not even thinking about the story (what story?) - the only thing I can think when she's onscreen in the last couple of episodes is ""oh, poor Melissa McBride that she had to take Carol in this stupid direction.""

Morgan. Morgan was awesome and now he's not. And his most important episode was shoved in between finding out whether Glen was alive or not so instead of enjoying his episode I was irritated and couldn't care less about that particular story. And then they took him too far. Morgan is not stupid. He wouldn't have sacrificed the lives of many to save the life of one....the math doesn't work if his goal is lives saved.

And Rick - Rick rattles from psychotic, to determined leader, to overconfident a$$hole for some reason - oh wait - that's right, they need to get everyone where they need to be for that BIG FINALE that will BLOW OUR MINDS!!

The result is that while they are taking my favorite characters from me through terrible writing, they aren't introducing any new ones worth my time. Abraham, Rosita and Eugene have always come across as caricatures to me and I have never really cared too much about them. Aaron? What happened to Aaron? What happened to his friendship with Daryl? Talk about missed story opportunities. Denise was great and I was so hoping for a great story with her character, but yeah...the Walking Dead narrative is basically bankrupt - they've got no currency but contrived death and dead-maybe-not-dead manipulations. Denise had to go so that Daryl would start the stupid domino crash course for Negan- even though there was no real story there that demanded he do that.

The finale was the last straw for me. The entire season we were promised the most intense, hardest hitting finale ever in the history of TV. But the finale was one more bait and switch in a season full of them. The first 90% was our entire savvy group of survivors getting herded around like rats in a maze and not one of them gave it a second thought. Why on earth would they load everyone into an RV rather than send one fleet-footed person to fetch the doctor? My point is that the writers could have come up with something better than the ridiculous contrived thing that was The Finale. Was J.D. Morgan as Negan impressive? Absolutely. I loved him. I enjoyed about 6 minutes of Negan but it went on for too long and I got bored. And then, finally - all impact was totally sucked from that episode - and the season which lived only to get them to that episode - when they stole that scene from us. Who did they kill? The Show. They killed their show.

I miss Daryl. I miss Carol. I miss Rick. Michonne remains and I love her but her story has stalled in spite of Richonne. Sasha is getting dragged down too. Glen and Maggie haven't been totally lost yet either but Glen's fake death and subsequent near death drained me. I grieved for him already so I don't really care if he lives or dies and Maggie seems peripheral when she shouldn't. Carl is still Carl and that's not necessarily a good thing.

I don't have cable so I've been buying Walking Dead seasons on Amazon. But after this finale I won't be paying for it anymore. There's no point. If I have to wait 6 months to find out who died, why not wait 17, find out if I should even bother, then watch it for free? I certainly won't care less in 17 months than I do right now.

7136456,5,B00WNBABVC,"Not many genre series have their best moments five seasons in, but thats how long its taken AMCs The Walking Dead to accrue the history required to deliver an impact more meaningful than just the loss of a fan-favorite character or the letdown when a destination inevitably fails to be what our core group of protagonists had hoped. With four seasons worth of character development informing character interactions and decisions, Walking Dead has molded its characters into a fiercely loyal family thats at once both a force of savage brutality and civility. Having imbued them with such a distrust of outsiders and forced them to adapt to a dangerous world, we now see them face the series hardest question: can they ever really assimilate back into a society? Or will any society that attempts to assimilate them be forced to change to accommodate the mindsets Grimes and company learned out in the wilderness?

After a dull fourth season both teased and dispelled the paradise of Terminus in far too rapid a succession, the fifth season couldn't stand to make the same mistake. This made the introduction of yet another idyllic society midway through the season feel somewhat lazy. Would the writers really repeat the whole this society isn't what it seems concept that theyd already used with the Governor and then Terminus? The Walking Dead had spent the last two seasons harping on the theme that other humans were just as, if not more, dangerous than the zombies that had overtaken the living. Luckily, the fifth season learned from past mistakes and chose to try something new: give the characters something genuinely good and see how they handle it.

Of course, they have to earn it first. In the world of The Walking Dead that means escaping from the prison of Terminus that they ended up in at the conclusion of the fourth season and then miraculously reuniting with the key collection of characters weve come to root for: Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), his son Carl (Chandler Riggs), and katana-wielding Michonne (Danai Gurira); survivalist soulmates Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Carol (Melissa McBride); newlyweds Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Glenn (Steven Yeun); PTSD sufferer Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green); and the relative newcomers Sgt. Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz), Dr. Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt), Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos), and Tara (Alanna Masterson). Their road to a new civilization is long and marked with an untrustworthy priest (Seth Gilliam), loss, vengeful survivors of Terminus, a detour to save a friend they thought dead, and a drought that threatens to wipe them all out with dehydration.

When the plot finally gets around to the introduction of Alexandria and its community of survivors (11 episodes into the season), were more than ready to see Rick Grimes and his family get a break, unfortunately everything weve followed them through for the past four seasons means every action and word that greets them in Alexandria is met with suspicion. Is the community as genuinely wholesome as its matriarch Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh) would have them believe? And if so, how has it survived in the modern world of scavengers and zombies?

Alexandria presents the most interesting scenario for The Walking Dead since the first season, and the writers smartly take their time letting characters reveal facets of the society, its imperfections, and the ways that it is exactly what Deanna claims. For once were given a scenario where the most sinister villain isn't the hidden intentions of a secretly evil populace but rather the frustrations and naivet of a group of people whove lived so long inside of a bubble that they're unaware of how bad things have gotten on the outside. Watching Rick Grimess crew quickly step into leadership roles (by fighting off a horde of the undead from a construction site, or search for survivors in the wild) is a richly satisfying outcome for the characters after all theyve been through, but its not without its share of genuinely fear-inducing moments as one of the series best characters goes head-to-head with one of Alexandrias more cowardly inhabitants in the woods. The conclusion of the season signals more growing pains ahead for Alexandria as well as a return to the norm for the series as a new band of scavengers is introduced as the likely foes for the sixth season.

As a final note: few moments in this season were as sublime as the return of Lennie James as the incredibly badass, staff-wielding Morgan Jones. His most triumphant scene both highlighted how much hes changed in the years since Rick Grimes left him in Atlanta and the kind of people our heroes will be facing next year.

7136491,5,B00WNBABVC,"Season six is quite possibly my favorite season after the original, but I think Season 7 will change that later this year. Seasons four and five really dragged for me to the point that I almost gave up on it, but I was intrigued by the last half of season five when they found Alexandria. Season six had a lot of action, suspense, and controversial cliffhangers. This review will contain some spoilers!

The group must not only deal with over 1,000 zombies trying to invade Alexandria but they have to fight off more evil groups of people such as the Wolves and the Saviors. Morgan was given his very own solo episode that shows why throughout this season he lives by his 'All life is precious' motto, but the action and storytelling make up for it. My top 3 favorite episodes are JSS when the Wolves attack and Carol really steps up her 'Rambo' game, Not Tomorrow Yet when Rick leads a full on assault against a group of sleeping Saviors, and Last Day on Earth, the hugely controversial episode that ends on a massive cliffhanger. Rick Grimes steps into a much larger world when he meets Paul Rovia, who goes by the nickname, Jesus. Jesus leads Rick and his people to the Hilltop where they learn about the Saviors and their leader, Negan. Negan may very well be the toughest adversary Rick and his group has faced yet.

The TV show is it's own evolving story, of which not all will come from the comic story line. Great job. Can't wait until August when it comes out on Blu-ray.

7136505,5,B00WNBABVC,"Simply stated Season 6 was phenomenal as 1-5.  This show is not all about walkers..aka zombies, it is about people!  The walkers are only a backdrop to the show.  The real threat are humans.  The scary part is if an end of the world type of situation happened, good people will be outnumbered by bad.
Some episodes do run on the slow side and you see less walkers than in other episodes/seasons, but those episodes are character driven.  I for one, love to see how the characters are reacting to their surroundings, their feelings and their backstories (I hope they do one for the villan at the end of the season).
SPOILERS---

For those who are upset about the season finale...just calm down.  It is a TV show and cliffhangers are what the network, producers, writers and directors want and almost have to do.  Has no one ever watched television before?  I've never seen Dallas and I know about the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" finale, Lost had a cliffhangers, even Scandal has cliffhangers.  If you have to absolutely know who Lucille meets, buy or go to your local library and read the comics.

7136515,5,B00WNBABVC,"Deeper than its given credit for, the show parks itself in a laboratory of human emotion and ethical dilemmas. The question of ethics and pragmatism is always being played out: what's right in a world gone wrong, where the moral compass has been swept away by the bare need to survive; find food...hope...life...love...and when all the above is threatened or taken away: vengeance.

The season finale removes the floor and drops the viewer down an elevator shaft, all too familiar but has it ever been this dark? Have the stakes been so high?

It's the ultimate and undeniable question of the survival of the fittest, and as some despair to ask: survive for what? The entire show is a study in the metanarrative of ultimate questions we all live in: what are you living for? Why? Who determines right and wrong - is it always, simply, the biggest bully?

Personally, I can't wait for next season. But the finale leaves you breathless.",1459814400,,934,4.753086419753086
7136516,2,B00WNBABVC,"I loved this show, couldn't wait till the next episode/season... until now.  This season is so all over the place.  I don't know how they got from A to B in this season. The plot lines are hard to follow which makes it difficult to care what happens next, which I pretty much don't, anymore.  So the writers and directors can make it as far fetched as they want, changing the cinematic style anytime they feel like it, up the violence every season, threaten or kill any of the best characters just for the shock value of it, jump over plot-hole after plot-hole like they honestly can't see them.  I won't complain, cause I am not anticipating this show anymore.  They lost me.  To bad too, cause I was really very interested in how it would work out for the group before season 6.  But then they came across a humongous group that happens to be made up solely of every surviving bouncer (they were all huge and so mean looking. How did they all end up in the same place? Weird.) in the world.  I just had to roll my eyes and say, ""Why didn't those guys simply go to Alexandria in the first place?""  And what's up with Daryl's dirty greasy hair in absolutely every episode.  I don't understand why that would be the hair choice, honestly?
Anyway, maybe I'll see how it ends up when it gets to Netflix, but I think a better way is to just ask someone who's seen it. I'll get the same result without the frustration and irritation of watching this bloody, violent, aggravating show anymore.
On the up side, the acting is still great and I do like the characters.  The cast is amazing and does continue to get better.",1459814400,5,1613,4.361204013377926

AMC just wants people to keep watching, so instead of writing a good story, interesting dialogue, believable character development, they just go for the easiest, cheapest possible way to get people to tune in, and that's writing cliffhanger endings.

I could go on and on about how stupid this season has been.  I could talk about all the stupid decisions that Rick has made throughout the season.  I could talk about the absolute failure to make me care about any of the new characters.  I could talk about how I don't even care about the main characters anymore.

7136535,1,B00WNBABVC,"The whole second half of the season sucked. After Rick's group met the saviors, it got stupid. All Ricks group did was wander around making stupid mistakes. The writing was very lazy. I mean, Dwight getting the jump on Daryl twice?  I'm sorry, but it is not suspense when you have characters do stupid things. A second grader could write better than that!  I am upset I had to pay $30.00 to watch this season. If TWD was smart, they would fire all the writers from this season. They deserve to be fired after the stupid season finale. Ciffhangers belong in pulp magazines. Not on modern television. You just made all of your viewers angry. Thanks a lot for ruining a good tv show.",1459728000,19,680,4.475806451612903
7136536,1,B00WNBABVC,"What was once an interesting show has gone downhill.  This season was the worst...from all the artsy episodes and scenes in an attempt to get an award nomination, to the writers intentionally misleading the audience in an attempt to get a rise out of us.  The tired writing made the show so predictable despite them being able to take the show in several other and more interesting directions.  Parallels can be drawn between the writers and the Saviors in the finale, as much like the saviors, the writers wasted a lot of scenes forcing the characters to go in directions that most people with their experience and supposed intelligence wouldn't have taken otherwise.  It's really quite sad and boring.",1459728000,,703,4.882352941176471

Loved the season six finale and I promise I am not going to give away any spoilers or make any predictions as to, ""who was it?"" or anything like that but I have to say that while watching the final season six episode, there was one visual image I simply could NOT get out of my mind once it got in there. (still can't, actually) Picture if you will: In a long, widescreen shot, the camper keeps driving rapidly back and forth across the screen while the theme song from The Benny Hill Show (Yakity Sax) loudly plays. Geez, I really hope I won't have this scene looping over and over again in my head all the way until season seven begins!",1459728000,,701,4.2388059701492535
7136541,5,B00WNBABVC,"Has anyone noticed that IT HAS NOT RAINED once in 6 episodes (years)? I live in Atlanta, Georgia. Not only does it rain here year round, we have SNOW. They only film THE WALKING DEAD during the spring and summer months. Where are the characters in the fall, winter and early spring? ON VACATION NOT ON LOCATION. They have handled food shortages, survived without weapons or gas but one rain drop and everyone is off the set. Attention cast and crew, film some scenes in the rain and maybe at least one snow day. Let's see if walkers survive rain? Let's see if all these new SAVIORS are as bad ass as they are being portrayed. I don't just wanna see a little rain, I want to see thunder and lightning and mud! I WANNA SEE EVERYONE UP TO THEIR NECKS IN RED GEORGIA CLAY!",1459728000,4,768,4.303448275862069
7136542,5,B00WNBABVC,"They did it again. Build up the suspense and of course leave us with the worst cliffhanger. I say worst because 6 months is too long of a wait again. and not only the wait is bothersome, no matter how much I will try to avoid it, I will be surrounded with all these theories about what happened in the end. I mean cliffhangers can be good but when you build it up to the end and then nothing again? it really sucks and its getting old. by the the time 6 months come around it will be kinda like ""yea what now?"" Still though  I gave it a 5 stars because Season 6 was one helluva a ride. and Negan is mostly the reason why its at 5 stars.",1459728000,,636,3.8923076923076922

How 'bout we find out that the military is still functioning, or that the world outside of that area has survived or even recovered? Maybe Rick and the Gang are forced to assimilate back into post-zombie society, but can't handle it and they all kill themselves. That would be entertaining.

The characters did things that were out of character, such as not bothering to be cautious or preplan.  Neegan isn't even really that scary, although he is brutal.  If the show continues to favor brutality rather than suspense, I don't see myself watching it much longer.  For me, the suspense is everything and there wasn't much in the last episode.

7136590,5,B00WNBABVC,"This show was on almost 2 years before I gave it the time of day to watch it. I have always thought zombie movies were stupid until I finally sat down to watch a full episode to see what everyone was talking about. I haven't missed an episode yet.

Why I like this series is it shows how people band together to survive a post apocolyptic world. I think its pretty accurate on how mankind would react to loosing every form of comfort. The acting is fabulous. Zombies? Pretty gorey. I have always had a hard time with this knowing that rotting flesh and half skeletonized zombie can eat flesh and get nutrition from it. It would have been more realistic to have zombies like the ones in ""I am Legend.""  Other than that factor it is realistic and great graphics leave you on the edge if your seat and thats a great program! Im going to be devistated when this program ends. Fear the Walking Dead is pretty good also.

Carol seems to be growing a heart or a conscience, and it looks pretty painful.  She has gone from being a cold and ruthless killer, to a tearful and remorseful one.

The attention to detail has suffered. The writing has suffered. A few characters seem to completely betray what we have come to know as their true selves.

7136751,2,B00WNBABVC,"I love The Walking Dead, however, Season 6 went south and never made a comeback. As any true fan knows, the series was never about the zombies; they were simply part of the environment but posed a constant and horrifying threat to the living. Many of the early reviews panned The Walking Dead for the zombies' limited role but I didn't find it a problem. However, after the zombie-slaughterfest prompted by the loss of Rick's latest love interest, there are virtually no zombies left. The few that remain are nothing more than an afterthought and I would now agree that the show's premise has been undermined. Without zombies in the mix, the show is more of a soap opera revolving around the romances which blossomed over the course of six seasons. I am assuming that the show's writers are sci-fi and horror specialists because that would explain the wooden, sterile and awkwardness one feels watching the new couples in bed. The season finale is next week and I pray for redemption; otherwise I don't see the need for a seventh season.",1459209600,8,1037,4.734806629834254

7136800,1,B00WNBABVC,"Although there were one or two decent episodes this season, overall, this is the worst season yet. Episodes 14 and 15 reached an all-time low. Walking Dead has created many interesting characters, but for some reason the writing staff doesn't know what to do with them. Often the characters, instead of gaining depth, are forced by the writers to act totally out of character. Interesting possibilities are often cut short by an arbitrary death or an unlikely change in development while at the same time the tired plots retread the same ground over and over again. Angela Kang is the best writer of the group. Show runner, Scott Gimple, on the other hand, is clueless and needs to be replaced, and Robert Kirkwood needs to be told to stick to his comic books and leave what was once an intriguing show alone. My advice: Bring back Frank Darabont.",1459209600,5,847,4.72972972972973

7136903,4,B00WNBABVC,"This was, in a sense, a quieter season before a another storm hits. I find myself wondering as a show fan, rather than a comic book fan (sorry, all you purists), is it necessary to follow the story line laid out in the books quite so...'fan-natically"" (pun intended). I enjoy some of the quieter moments, the little moments where characters take a breather and you actually get to watch a character's growth and inner struggles. I especially enjoyed those moments this season. I'd like to see more of an actual community building and those challenges, instead of, yet again, it seems running up against another tyrannical, power mad maniac leader. I really hated seeing the end of Denise and the apparent Maggie mis-carriage, etc. The acting itself if you enjoy character building really went up a notch. The yanking the rug from out under the feet every time something is going good is getting a little old with yet another crazed tyrant  - even for the end of the world",1459209600,,971,4.711764705882353

Alexandria is a place that offers some security and a chance to live a somewhat normal life. Yet despite these facts, two of the main characters Daryl and Carol decide leave. Both going in different directions and for there own reasons. Reasons that are not valid, justified nor rational given the overall situation. Not only did they put there lives in danger, but those searching for them. Sorry, but the writers goofed up big on this one. All for the climatic ending of the season.

7136969,3,B00WNBABVC,"I loved TWD the first couple of seasons. Really gritty and down to earth, at least as much as possible with fantasy zombies. Now, TWD seems like a long soap opera punctuated by moments of violence. Also it seems like TWD writers have made some bad decisions, like ""killing"" Glenn, and in the next-to-last episode, sending all the heavy hitters on two unbelievably stupid chases caused by a couple of unbelievably stupid actions on the part of Carol and Darrin. For two really level-headed objectively realistic ice-cold fighters, as they have been, they acted like a couple of drunk high school kids. All this lovey-dovey relationship stuff does nothing for me, either (see my ""soap opera"" comment above).

7136979,4,B00WNBABVC,"Hint of a spoiler included at very end so don't read that part, won't go into detail but still.
The first episode of the season went on entirely too long in flashback mode. I despised the black and white aspects. That being said, I did like the various perspectives of the same event.

The guy with the cane, darn his name has completely escaped me, now that entire episode was a waste of 60 minutes of my life. Although as it's Prime and no commercials more like 48 minutes, hey, got to find silver lining where one can.

I'm at the part where the group, in my opinion has finally officially crossed over to the Dark Side, will be interesting to see where it goes from here. Uh, what the heck was Maggie doing there? Does no one have common sense? And what's up with poor Carol?

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
My biggest complaint thus far is the 'saving' of Glenn. Yes, I love his character. Yes, I was horrified. But it feels like a cop out and I'm kind of disappointed. The things that make shows great is that, fudge on a stick, sometimes our favourite characters don't make it.",1459209600,,1077,4.375

The series in and of itself is to me when of the best of all time in the treatment and development of characters.  It's gory yes, but it's not about that so in the midst of much of the action you have characters you care about.  While many of the characters are formidable, there isn't any of the inane banter or goofy posturing that would see in such cases.

7137114,5,B00WNBABVC,"This show is truly incredible!  I don't like those shows where there is no character development or character consistency; those shows that go back and forth on who should be with whom (because that's super important, right?), and the ones with no plot line.  The Walking Dead is nothing like that.  Because it's a group of people in the worst of circumstances, their true selves are constantly being revealed.  As a result, character development is huge.  It's so interesting to see how the people's experiences change and mold them in different ways than their companions.  In the beginning you've got a scared little lady who becomes the biggest freaking badass around.  You've got the person who joins the apocalypse a little late and is reluctant to kill, and he develops so much that he rips a guy's throat out with his TEETH with no hesitation in order to save his family.  The directors are not afraid to kill off characters, and while it's heartbreaking most of the time, it means the characters are never stagnant.  Nobody is safe, and it keeps you on your toes.  This isn't just a zombie show.  It's a story of epic proportions, of the people surviving together, fighting against the dead, the living, and circumstances.  The best and worst parts of people are revealed when everything around them falls apart.  This show is amazing.",1459209600,,1344,4.816593886462882

While I appreciate a lot of in depth,meaty story-telling...and it is always very well done on this show...I still want my fix..otherwise, I get bored and frustrated..it's kinda like giving too much foreplay.it's nice for a while to be intrigued and stimulated..but after a bit too much,it's like..okay,let's get to it.

7137195,3,B00WNBABVC,"This has gone from an exciting fun to watch action show to a run of the mill soap opera drama. The lengthy character and plot development is difficult to sit through. The unrealistic creature comforts the characters enjoy are downright silly; the shower scene, in ep. 15 ""East"", with Glen and Maggie, as an example, is hard to believe. They really have that huge luxury shower with endless hot water after the zombie apocalypse? Or gas for cooking large feasts, or power for refrigerators! The early seasons were more realistic, which I found enjoyable. On a positive note I do think the production is good. Maybe binge watching the sixth season would be a better experience, but the traditional episodic presentation has me looking for other shows to watch.",1459209600,2,758,4.883720930232558

7137213,3,B00WNBABVC,"I found this season to be disappointing. Too many emotional music scenes, not enough problem solving.  Geography and the science behind survival seems to have disappeared  the scope of the series has devolved into a fight between Rick and the group led by a two dimensional character villain. It isn't helped that there are jarring problems with realism. Why would they clutter up the area right outside the gate with vehicles and buildings that bad guys can hide behind? How can there still be plus-size people  when they are worried about starving?  It's more difficult to suspend belief.

7137293,2,B00WNBABVC,"This season is a little disappointing. The actors are doing a great job, but the writing is suffering from lag and the brand is afraid to kill off any major players. They're about to kill Glen (I believe) and they've already prepped the audience with a fake death mid-season. Clever, but kind of cheap. If Negan kills someone other than Glen, I probably won't watch season 7I'll assume the show has lost its flare. Seriously, they need to kill a major player soon (besides Glen, the obvious choice). It can't be any major players that make the TV series unique from the comic (Daryl, Morgan) because that would be dumb. Especially Morganwhy bring him back into the mix if you're going to just kill him off after he makes a stand against Rick. And, honestly, Rick is getting a little annoying. There's no reason behind his decisions anymore.
Anyway, that's how I feel about it.",1459209600,,876,4.658064516129032

If the writers just killed Daryl, I will never watch this show again. You can't possibly think that's ok with the fans!!!!!!!!!!!",1459123200,,150,5.291666666666667
7137432,1,B00WNBABVC,"This will not play on my phone.  What a waste, I ordered this to watch on a trip and cannot watch it.  I will watch it for free when I get home and use my DVR.  Wasted money as the Amazon app cannot play the video.",1459123200,,214,3.608695652173913
7137433,3,B00WNBABVC,"As the series has evolved, the overall quality of the show has declined. The world created by the original comic books has been shown to be a fertile environment for drama, action, and conflict (man v man, man v environment, man v self). Yet as we move from season to season,  the writers have struggled to maintain the same level of adrenaline pumping excitement which was injected to our collective consciousness with the first season.  And that makes sense.  It's the ""Home Improvement"" effect, Tim Allen is good at telling jokes, but after the first couple episodes we see the same shtick every week.  This is where TWD writers are now, they stuggle to give us something new and it shows in the faux drama created in the relationships.  Don't get me wrong, this is a hard thing to do as a writer, but it can be done (e.g. BBC's Sherlock).  Unfortunately,  TWD writers go for awkward and contrived scenarios which leave characters not reacting as we would expect a seasoned apocalypse survivor to react just so they can get caught by competing groups for the sole purpose of serving the plot. The show has transitioned from the living fighting to survive to a lawless soap opera with the occasional undead attack and a plethora of self aggrandizing monologues. I think there is an intentional move to that type of show. TWD execs know their core audience and the most fervent fans are quick to bear their emotions regarding the plot lines and criticism of where the show is going. All one has to do is read any social media thread regarding the character of Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and you get a sense of the maturity level of those who express their opinion and their disdain for those who disagree. In the end, I can't fault TWD for feeding the trolls, it is a good formula for longevity,  but that does not guarantee the quality of the writing.",1459123200,22,1854,4.613981762917933
7137434,5,B00WNBABVC,"I absolutely love this show. When it first came out I thought it wouldn't be something that I could get into, so I didn't start watching it until season 2. I had to go back and get up to speed on how it all began, and I've been hooked ever since. I don't know what I'm going to do when it all comes to an end!

7137443,5,B00WNBABVC,I love the walking dead. I was skeptical at first and honestly thought it seemed like a stupid show. Over my Christmas break from school my fiance talked me into watching a few of the first episodes to see if I liked it. He had already been watching it and he said he really thought I would like the show. I agreed but still was convinced I would think it was stupid and won't want to watch it. I was dead wrong. I love this show and now look forward to Sundays when it comes on. If we don't watch it on Sunday night we always watch it Monday after I have class. I was completely wrong and this TV show has totally sucked me in to their world. I managed to catch up from season 1 while I was on break from school and was ready to watch the new season in Jan before classes started back. I did a ton of binge watching during Dec and Jan.,1458950400,,836,3.9526627218934913

Certain cast members would still be alive and vice versa.  Not a big fan of the Michonne/Rick love relationship thing going on, but it still works.  If the comic book would have been followed, Andrea would still be alive and she and Rick would be together.

7137474,5,B00WNBABVC,"I am a regular follower of The Walking Dead (TWD) and enjoy the storyline, brilliant make-up artists and characters (also, brilliant writers who keep it interesting).  There is just enough character-death to add that all-important element of ""mystery"" and ""intrigue"" which keeps the ratings to the sky.

However frequent traveling for work precludes me from watching the series on AMC (many hotels do not carry this channel).  Well, lucky me - My family gave me the Amazon FireTVStick for Christmas this past year so I can catch-up when it's convenient to my schedule.  Don't mean to make this sound like an advertisement, but grateful for this little technological break-thru and wanted to share to others who travel (I spend over 240 nights/year in hotels).  So, it's a win for Amazon, a win for me AND a win for TWD....Enjoy!!",1458518400,,829,4.9352517985611515

7137538,3,B00WNBABVC,"It's become a medicore soap opera with zombies as a backdrop. At least in other zombie-based drama / horror movies the zombies evolve somehow and become a dynamic part of the narrative.  Given the sycophantic praise for this show I don't expect my comments to make much of a dent but wanted to express my disappointment with this show. It's become a carousel of temporary characters many of whom last for one or maybe two episodes while the main characters alternate between pacifism and rage. That's been going on since Season 1 and it's amazing how little the primary characters have evolved. Sure, they have some episodes dedicated to explaining the back story of individuals as a way to take a break from the action but the characters. Yes I understand that it loosely follows the comic book series although watching them repeat the same mistakes is wearing thin as there is no development - just variations on a limited number of themes.",1458259200,8,942,4.779141104294479

I'm not liking forward to meeting Negan, so we'll see how that turns out.  Love, love, love this show, though!  My teenage son and I watch it together every week, and is the only thing we do together that he's really excited about.  Family bonding time over TWD!!!",1458086400,,540,4.404040404040404

The characters continue to capture the most human of emotions while having to deal with a world that remains full of zombies and danger at all times. And this season questions, How much change is okay in these characters? Are they becoming just as bad as some of the other humans they have dealt with in the past? AMC TV continues to provide quality tv. I recommend The Walking Dead. Yes, it has zombies. But the series is truly about the people we meet in The Walking Dead.",1458000000,,541,4.366336633663367

I wondered how could anyone like zombie movies. I was just arrogant and now I feel really bad. I will never again say that I don't like anything before trying it. Because The Walking Dead is awesome! !!! I saw the first 5 seasons on Netflix in less than 2 weeks!  I couldn't do anything else but watching!  I like each caracter in particular,  for different reasons. I can't say anything negative,  eventually I can say that I hope that it will continue as long as possible. Give it a try, even if you think that zombies are ridiculous. The interactions between the living characters is so powerful, the fight for survival shows the bad but also the good part of our human nature. I just love it.

Overall the walking dead was a great show with great acting and characters ruined by poor writing and directing its a real shame hopefully the writers will get their s*** together and return the show to it's former glory",1457568000,4,1172,4.492957746478873

Well This season has renewed my faith in how well the comics are and how that can adapt into a better story for the show.

They have done a fantastic job in bringing one of the best story arcs from walking dead into a show that was just about as off of the course of the reading material as you can get. This season has been fantastic thus far and am really enjoying seeing how the slowly meld the reading material into the story they have already set in the AMC representation of the comic.

7138017,5,B00WNBABVC,"Is it just me, or does this series just keep getting better ? Most series' hit a peak and then start fading away by now, but this series (season six) the situations and characters never stop evolving. The writers for this show should get a medal or something! And the quality of the camera work, the acting (which is great) the professional sound, the director is brilliant, and last but not least, HOW DO THEY MAKE THAT STUFF LOOK SO REAL!? If it's not CGI, then these guys have made an art of making all the zombie bashing look so real that I actually gasp out loud sometimes! YIKES! The action never stops. The gore is horrifying (but in a good way)...This series reminds me of other fantastic titles, like Justified, or Supernatural (and a select few others) they just keep drawing you in. Everyone I know watches this show. I was looking for something good to watch and my son said The Walking Dead is about the BEST series he's ever seen. Soooo, I started watching it from the first episode, and then I binged all the way to season four and paid for the 5th.... I. Was. Hooked. Bad! We're caught up (dang) and now were waiting for the next episode. And Glen better NOT be dead or I my wife will have a caniption fit!!
SPOILER:This review is for fans that are probably freaking out as bad as I am. Glen is alive! My wife is very happy; when Glen finally crawled out from beneath that dumpster she as punching me in the arm (ouch) and shouting: Ooo! Ooo! I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU !!! Honestly, I'd already heard rumors. I'd heard that fans were going to riot, and start a mutiny if Glen was gone. Okay....whew...good one that! But all of a sudden Rick and the ""family"" are running out of supplies. They're slowly starving, BUT THEN. Rick and Darrell meet a guy....Jesus. Yes, I said Jesus. A guy named Jesus. But this Jesus, (a regular guy) might turn out to be the answer for our desperate heroes? Turns out, not so much. Once again. The writers change gears near midseason.
UPDATE!!!
OMG!!! Did everybody see this ending?!?! WTH! I'm freaking out! Who just got their head.... oh, man!!! Nope...not gonna do it...I just can't potentially spoil this for somebody. But...OH MAN! Does this show freaking rock, or what!? (rhetorical question) The actors, the writers.. BRAVOOOO! (Lots of clapping)

To me this is a very significant change in the product I paid for and had I known about this change in release time in the fall, I wouldn't have purchased it. This is what I sent to amazon:

Hi I would like to cancel the remainder of my order for The Walking Dead Season 6. When I purchased this season in the fall, the episodes would be realeased around 10pm Hawaii time which is not too late for me since I am a fan of the show. Lately, however the episodes are not released until about 3 a.m. Had I know about this change in release time I never would have ordered the season. You have changed the product you sold me with notice or compensation. Please cancel the rest of the season pass for me. Also please refund the episode I purchased on February 29. The episode was available for single purchase but not to season subscribers, and I read that you would refund those kinds of purchases. Anyway I think you should revamp how you get all those episodes out. It is very frustrating to be a SD season pass holder. I have to wait usually an hour, first as the HD episode is released, then the SD episode, then the HD season pass is available, then finally I am allowed to watch what i signed up for months ago.",1457395200,2,1439,4.251824817518248

I'm usually so worn out after one of these episodes, that I have to go take a nap. There was a lot of thought put into choosing the main actors and actresses that had to play off each other to make the episodes seem so real. I am up to date of al episodes and appreciate  being told when a new episode is ready to watch. There are ever several zombie movies/series on right now, but why watch them when you can see the best one in The Walking Dead. I would hope that all of them get a good salary as they certainly work hard for the money. Thanks for all the great movies and choices that we are given to view in between episodes.  Great job and congratulations on all of the actors roaming around in the background playing their roles of being zombies.",1457308800,,920,4.175141242937853

It's when the going gets tough that some either find a way to be stronger or they struggle and need help or become lost. Rick Grimes and everyone else must face hard choices and sometimes insanely difficult choices. I can't help but wonder how I would handle it if the choices were mine. The cast are fine examples of solid, competent actors. There is no over-acting that can distract from the drama unfolding. Those people, young and old, do such a good job bringing people that I care about to life. And in this story line there are people who make mistakes and need to be forgiven and when they find forgiveness and peace the drama hits a high point. Yes, the idea of a zombie apocalypse is weird.

I think the reason I never got into it is the whole concept of violence & gore & zombies just didn't seem like my kind of show.  Once I got a few episodes under my belt, I realized it's more about the stories of survival and the human spirit... how and why does the evil & good come out in people when we're truly stripped down to survival mode.

7138824,2,B00WNBABVC,"Both the plots in Season 5 and Season 6 of The Walking Dead have seemed exceptionally slow moving. It's not that I expect the show to be action -packed, with lots of blood and gore, I am perfectly content with a slower moving show, so long as something is happening.

I feel like the writers lack either the imagination or the capability of bringing some resolution to the series. What do I mean by that? Well, allow me to explain. I can summarize most seasons in the following manner: new crazy bad guy ---> people split up ---> multiple episodes where nothing important happens --> epic episode where the main characters save the day ---> somebody dies ---> repeat. Every season follows, more or less, this structure. Ever since the beginning of the show, I have been looking forward to the day when advancements were made that could help return the planet to some form of normality. Early on, there were a few seasons were I really thought that was what the show was going to be about: a group of people that, against all odds, build a life for themselves in the midst of utter social breakdown. When the crew was heading to the CDC and Washington D.C., for example, the writers portrayed the main characters as having, potentially, the power to make a big difference. Lately though, the same fundamental plot line keeps repeating, and it is getting boring.

Sure, the writers have tried to spice things up by killing off characters and bringing new ones on. Yes, the writers have introduced new romances and new dramas. Those things don't appeal to me in the long term. They spike my adrenaline in the moment, but do little else.

I guess what I am saying is that it would be nice to see something drastically different happen.

I still love the series, but if the episodes remain as slow going as they are now, I don't know how much longer I will be watching it.",1456531200,,1867,4.5476190476190474

I was not really expecting for Michonne and Rick to connect, however it is really a good fit and she loves Karl and Judith as if they were her own children and I don't think Karl will be upset when he finds out. Now Jesus is a real character and he definitely needs to be on the team. He has some serious hand to hand combat and could have taken Rick and Daryl out easily !

Finale: I spent all season waiting to see which of my favorites they were going to freaking kill ... now I have to wait until next season. Worse, it may leak, and that would be more awful than not knowing. Is Carol going to become bad-ass again and kill mean ol' Negin for everyone?

7139205,5,B00WNBABVC,"I came late to this party - just tried it this year and binge watched from the beginning. I have to say it's the most enjoyable television show that I've ever watched. The story is beautiful in its raw emotion, how it strips down everyone physically and emotionally, forcing the characters to live life perhaps how it should be lived: in the moment, urgent, thankful for every moment of life. These characters get inside your heart and stay - their evolution or devolution keeps the storyline fresh. The backdrop of chaos, gore, blood and a broken world contrasts with the beauty and dignity of this band of lost souls and their poignant struggle to find or keep those characteristics alive in themselves. The well-chosen songs and the soundtrack further enhance the mood, providing a voice for the characters where words sometimes fail and never distracting from the overall theme of the episode. I see flaws, but I can forgive them, and they don't change my overall enjoyment of this adventure. I'm along for the ride now and can't wait to see where we're going next.",1455753600,7,1069,4.783783783783784

We all know how popular Star Trek was even though they had cardboard sets and horrible monster costumes that were obviously made of foam.  But the cast made that show work.

This episode delivered surprises I did not see coming, and that's rare for a seasoned viewer like myself. There have been some recent episodes that were less than impressive.

I  started watching Season 1 EPs during Season 3 and was hooked from the first EP. The depth of emotions, I, as the viewer go through...from excitement, dread, fear and sadness. This show does one of those rare things, makes the viewer truly love and care about the characters. It's also fun to think about how, you, yourself, would handle the situations the characters find themselves in.

7139428,4,B00WNBABVC,Not the best season of the series. It's still entertaining but this season took a more dramatic look at characters and spent more time with flash backs and a whole lot of hum drummery in my opinion. Too much time of dead people roaming around in the woods and helps pussy characters that can't deal with the reality of the walking dead universe. But like I said it's still a great show and series but the season doesn't deserve a five star rating in my eyes.,1455667200,,458,4.337209302325581

Like Custer's last stand in reverse , and just when you think it cannot get ANY Worse......no spoilers..... WATCH IT/ Greatest series I have even been hooked on. Oddly, though I am realistic, one wonders if the future of humans really goes this way... life imitating art.  Throughout the whole series, the people turn to  crazies and cannot take care of each other faster than the dead can eat them. What does that say about us as a species.

Without a doubt, this episode rates one of the best of the entire series. Don't want to give spoilers. Suffice to say, the action, storyline, acting, cinematography, musical score and direction were beyond amazing.

It's not just one gross-out after another, it's quite possibly the best TV show I've ever, EVER seen. It has really good, deep, human stories.

7139739,5,B00WNBABVC,"As engaging and shocking as the first episodes! We remain devoted to the progress of Rick and his band of survivors. (I do think they dragged out the reveal about Glen. But I forgive it.) The opening-up toward the Alexandrians as truly accepted into the original troupe promises both deepened emotional appeal and opportunities for terror. And I can't wait to see what new, horrific zombie situations the writers thrust upon us! Sewer zombies and eyeball-stuck zombie were excellent, nauseating touches!",1454112000,,503,5.222222222222222

Interesting to see the characters evolve/devolve over the seasons. The episodes that are ""slow"" are enjoyable to me because they let you see into a character more fully. I really enjoy that the writers keep the story line similar to, but different than the novels so that we continue to be surprised. If we all knew what was coming, they'd lose some of their fan base. Great actors, great z effects, though sometimes the sound effects of the kills are a bit cheesy. Will continue to watch!",1453680000,,619,4.535714285714286

7139883,5,B00WNBABVC,Best tv series since MASH. Season 6 may not be the top season of the series but it should be in the top 3 and we have yet to see the second half. The character development and suspense has been excellent thus far. And for those who enjoy the gore and fast paced action it offers plenty of both.,1453248000,,294,4.0

It just seems that on a regular basis the writer's get bogged down in useless, worthless dialog, diatribe, and scenes that add absolutely nothing to the depth and dimension of the series.  Maybe it's to give the cast an opportunity to show the range of their artistic talent.  All I know is it makes me reach for the fast forward button.",1453161600,,397,4.410958904109589

7139896,3,B00WNBABVC,"To be honest I wasn't terribly impressed. This episode didn't leave on quite the cliff hanger that previous episodes have done in the past, especially for a mid season finale. Acting is top notch per usual and my favorite character is still rick as he continuously slips in and out of madness. I feel he is going to become the new ""governor"" which i am fine with because he is ultimately my favorite character.",1453075200,,410,4.554054054054054

7139968,2,B00WNBABVC,"The only thing keeping me going at this point is the memory of the character I love.  But honestly, I find myself more let-down than ever after each new episode.  The unique-ness of the characters is slowly being whittled down and I am seeing them all become the same.  I feel like writer's or maybe its the director, who knows, has an agenda.  Like someone working on this has a strong opinion about certain issues and that agenda is bleeding through on EVERY character.  Everyone is becoming the same and predictable.  This can often happen in writing and I think the writer's are falling into this mistake.  Its turning the show into a statement that reflects a person's set of beliefs and its causing all the stories, side stories and characters to morph into the same thing and honestly, its just growing stale.",1452384000,,816,4.664335664335664
7139969,1,B00WNBABVC,"Want to love this, but just can't.  The direction of the show has degraded slowly over the seasons and we see more of the writer's own personal philosophy and agendas taking over all of the characters as if they all have one mind.  I have finally decided its just not worth watching anymore.  Half way through this season, I realized I really just can't care about what happens anymore.  I want to, but the characters aren't true to themselves anymore.  They're all the same.  And for the few that seem like their own characters, well, the show goes about with the single objective of bringing them down to the cliched atheiistic pessimistic mold that the writer's have conformed every unique soul too.  Anyone who deviates from this is portrayed as a complete stereotyped moron.  The writer's could stand to back off on their agendas and let the characters speak for themselves again.  Move on to better pastures....  Its run its course.",1452384000,9,938,4.770186335403727

7140041,4,B00WNBABVC,"Taking my review down to a 4... here is why.

Great show, but why is our original cast not learning new techniques on how to defend there home.  Also, why are there so many flaws to their strategies.

I am also a little irked at the ""coincidences"" that keep occurring.  I would get the tractor hitting the wall at just the right time if the W's were watching... but they were not.  It was just a coincidence.  And to just happen to land on the horn... CMON!

I am also VERY irked they are not killing some of our main characters, that is one of the reason the show is so dang good.  I mean, they dangle it, they tease it, then they pull it back like chickens.  CMON!!  Part of what makes this great is we never know who is going to bite it.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy our main characters, but its time to rip one from us, make us Cringe!

Zombies, zombies and zombies and we are still getting bit?  Idiots.
Also, doesn't it bother you that they are driving junker cars.  Why in the heck haven't they found some really good vehicles, armored trucks and such, instead of this garbage they are driving.  Its not 40 years later, its a couple years, those things should be all over the place!

Don't get me wrong, I love the show, but they really need to act like they are learning, or whats the point of experiencing the same thing over and over again and not getting better at dealing with it?",1451347200,,1399,4.203007518796992

For years, I have been giving 5 stars to the seasons, but this one did not make the grade.  Basically, the writers seem to have to come up with more ridiculous stories or actions in order to make up for losing characters and it seems to be grating on the overall story.  I will still watch it and recommend others, but I think they creators need to get back to some basics on it.",1451260800,,470,4.142857142857143

Unfortunately, I sense the end coming- not soon- and my greatest hope is that they end on a high note. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it could be done. I have faith in our group and I believe that they too would want the series to have a memorable last-scene that would do justice to all that has gone before.

I expected this to be the same.  But this is lackluster at best.  I am very disappointed in this collector's set.  It's a plastic ""statue"" you could find in any comic shop for $40, but here I spent $135.  Normally pre-order sets drop around to 40% off a month before it gets shipped out, but not this one.  But I was dedicated to ordering it.  When I opened it finally I was underwhelmed and regretted the purchase.  The paint job also looks very muddy.  I know it's supposed to be blood and gore, but just feels like some random colors were shoddily mixed together and poured onto the ""statue"".  I feel like I'm stuck with it now, but I'm going to be wary and more critical of any future release TWD puts out.  A shame, they were doing so well until this set.",1450656000,3,924,4.308139534883721

7140108,5,B00WNBABVC,"The Walking Dead is something that you either get, or you don't. Season six part one explores group dynamics in a fairly new way, with the integration of new characters that are pivotal in some forthcoming events. It opens hard and carries some great underlying tension that isn't fully resolved at mid-season finale, but hints at where it's going. This is the season where a lot comes together. Sure there are plenty of icky Walker scenes, but the story itself has a purpose.

If you're a viewer who's still looking at the show as zombie schtick... this season, in particular, will be lost on you. If you understand who the ""walking dead"" really are, you'll be looking forward to the second half of the season. If you've not explored this show but have dialed it up because your buddies are going on about it, you really need to take a slow weekend and work your way through the series from episode one. A key aspect to enjoying the program is immersion the background on the experiences that inform the decisions of the characters.

As a programming note to newbies: the show splits its air dates into two halves, fall is first half with a mid-season finale that ends in time for the holidays, and it picks back up again in February for another six to eight episodes. As of posting date this would be the first half of season six so you'll have to catch the rest live on amc or here on amazon usually the day after it airs.",1450656000,2,1425,4.476923076923077

But, the dynamics and the characters are so well done, that I recommend this show to everyone. When you feel like you've lost a best friend when someone dies in this show, it's a testament to good writing and acting. I loved Scott Wilson, Hershel, and miss his character. I was so happy to see him at Comic Con! He's been missed! Abraham Lincoln is my favorite character and I love his acting and ability to bring fullness to the story. Rick goes from being totally level headed to places where you wonder if he's going to snap at any minute. I love how they capture the frailty yet bravery of the human spirit. Great job, you all!!

The characters have become a bit stale as well and the creators seemed to have already killed off anyone they can afford to lose creating a safety net that leaves viewers underwhelmed and the show fairly predictable.

My one star is for this $134 rip off. It's nice looking but come on Amazon....$134???? You can get great looking Walking Dead toys, figures etc for a fraction of the cost. Before this Amazon, offered tremendous special edition sets. Loved the tree walker whose arm moves when you take out the discs. The light up heads in a fish tank - very nice and best of all the screw drive in the Zombie's eyeball to open it up for the discs - a classic now selling for over $400!!!

7140234,5,B00WNBABVC,I've never really watched TWD for the zombies but more from the psychological aspect.  What would you do when faced with a live or die situation.  Who do you trust and why?  What do you hang on to from your past life and who do you become and why?  What are you willing to do to keep the ones you love safe or as safe as possible and what or whom do you sacrifice and how do you bring real meaning to those sacrifices and those sacrificed?  What keeps you from going over the edge or being able to come back from that?,1449273600,,518,3.9902912621359223
7140235,3,B00WNBABVC,"At this point, as each Season goes by, I keep wondering when and if they will ever adopt a different kind of story line. You still have people acting stupid and ruining it for everyone else and these never ending internal struggles, ""that's not who we are"".
I will continue to watch, but it really lost some of it's spark after Season 3, I feel like they treading water on same themes of people acting stupid that create the majority of the story lines and miraculous recoveries, afraid to let go the original cast...I think the Walking Dead writers ought to take their cues from the Game of Thrones and take a few more chances. No Spoiler alert but when one of the main cast members came back after you swore he was eaten, it just took a turn to after school special status. God how chilling and insane was Season 1 and 2 compared to this. It's just not the same anymore. But as I said, I will continue to watch.",1449273600,,913,4.313953488372093

7140240,3,B00WNBABVC,"This is an actual product review. Not a show review. First, I love the show immensely! While the detail & look of the character on top of the box is very good, I was very disappointed in the ""coolness"" of the piece. It simply was a far cry from the WOW factor the previous limited editions provided. There is no articulation of the character & to simply slide the box open to store the blu-ray discs is, for lack of a better word, lazy attempt at a limited addition. I have all of the previous seasons limited editions to compare it against.
Examples...2nd season-screwdriver in the eye unlocks head to tilt backwards to reveal discs. 3rd season-dismembered head cabinet with backlight & water filling capability & extra little body remnants. 4th season-VERY detailed stump zombie with articulating arm. Compared to 5th season-small detailed character, slide top back to reveal discs = ""Is that it?"". I wasn't pleased at all with cost to value ratio",1449273600,4,949,4.7926829268292686

The main group is just not on the show enough.  Each member might get an episode that features them but then they are missing in action the rest of the season.  They have spent far too much time showcasing the doomed Alexandria crowd.  I only like one character from that group.  It's Jesse Anderson and honestly I'm not crazy about her either.  The only episode I loved this season was Here's not Here.  Otherwise the main cast has barely done anything notable.  It seems like the make cameos and minor characters have all the lines.

7140289,3,B00WNBABVC,"Unfortunately not a great season overall. ""Here's Not Here"" was an excellent story in itself that gave viewers philosophical gristle to chew on while they await the next episode, and ""JSS"" featured a number or wonderful moments (watch how the kitchen timer marks a return to normalcy after the Wolf attack)...but other episodes were marred by plot holes and glaring inconsistencies in the reactions of the main characters.

The series is largely stuck in a stimulus-response loop that has dominated previous seasons, preventing any real progress in the story line.  But the largest disappointment of all was the teaser surrounding Glenn's death. The initial shock of seeing him on the ground surrounded by walkers becomes disbelief, and then dark comedy, when another episode opens and we see him facing 180 degrees from his earlier position, with Nate's body in a completely different position than logic suggests.  It was sloppy work, and I was reminded of a scene in Misery when Kathy Bates' character compare's James Caan's sloppy writing to a serial she saw as a child

  ""The bad guy stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the door shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death, and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out but the car went off a cliff before he could escape! And it crashed and burned and I was so upset and excited, and the next week, you better believe I was first in line...And there was Rocketman, trying to get out, and here comes the cliff, and just before the car went off the cliff, he jumped free! And all the kids cheered! But I didn't cheer. I stood right up and started shouting. This isn't what happened last week! Have you all got amnesia? They just cheated us! This isn't fair!

7140336,5,B00WNBABVC,"After the mid-season finale -- absolutely best season yet so far, and it can only get better.  And my motto for life is now ""JSS"" -- ""Just Survive Somehow"".  Enid and Nicholas (yes, that a-hole) were my favorites this season so far, besides all the regulars and semi-regulars (Go Jessie!).  SPOILER:  I was blown away by Nicholas' ""Thank you"" in Episode 3 -- even a-holes, ESPECIALLY A-HOLES, can sometimes redeem themselves before it's too late, which I guess is what Morgan is trying to get across.  In the end, Nicholas had his self-respect back again due to Glenn's ability to see him as a person, and that is why The Walking Dead is such a lesson for life on so many levels.  I was simply floored by that scene -- you could see that Nicholas' gratitude was the last thought on his mind before he pulled the trigger.  Glenn may later have more time to reflect on that moment, but in that instant, Glenn nearly paid the price for his forgiveness, as others may also have done and may yet do because of Morgan's life philosophy (we shall see).  But one can never say that The Walking Dead is ONLY about walkers and bad guys going after the good guys -- it's about LIFE and life's choices, and how do you live that life, before, during, or after a brutalizing, de-humanizing apocalypse of any kind?  I can't foresee ever turning my back on the Rick Grimes character; he's no angel, but he's certainly no devil.  Just a darn steadfast human being and father to boot.  If not for him, a whole lot of people who are alive now and have a game plan for survival would not be, and would not have.  Long live Rick, long live them all!",1449100800,,1628,4.408026755852843

I get it, that's their shtick, but it's a bad one because you can't build hype every 40 minutes and expect people to still care. I fully went into the mid season finale thinking ""They're just going to leave us off on a bad cliffhanger for the next several months"" and that's exactly what they did. And the best part?

7140388,3,B00WNBABVC,"Great drama, but very unrealistic.(Zombies aside.) Everything, goes wrong for the main characters all the time. It is bad enough that they live in world full of zombies, but there bad luck only begins there. A typical example would be they find a wall city, great news right? Wrong, the zombies are nearby in a huge pit, so instead of killing and burning them where they are, they decide to lead the zombies 20 miles away. (about a 10 hour walk from their city.) Of course, just when this is happening, a group of other survivors decide to attack the city. And of course they don't do it quietly, so a truck is left with its horn stuck on to attract the zombies they are trying to lead away. After defending the city, buildings near the city were left burning, and one tower decides to fall down and break a hole in the wall large enough for thousands of zombies to fill the town in a matter of minutes. (There was only a 1 in 4 chance it would fall tall the city) The odds the  other survivors would attack the city when they did, leave the horn blasting as long as it did, and the tower falling over the wall in one afternoon are astronomical. The speed of which slow walking zombies found their way between a burning building and the wall was amazing. Awhile this all happen yet other members of the main cast are ambushed along the road, apparently by a motor cycle gang just waiting on the road for people to rob.(What are the odds of that happening?)  These people are all going to die, not because of zombies, but because they have horrific luck, and bad problem solving skills.",1449100800,,1585,4.387755102040816

This box which does nothing cost a good bit more than the each of the previous limited editions which had moving parts and LEDs. I am very disappointed that the price on this didn't drop like it did with previous seasons. Needless to say I will not be buying the limited edition for season 6 when it comes out.

She is discerning; we trust her judgement, so we watched here in Maine, and had wonderful discussions with her the next day.  I am impressed with the strong women, with the literary, cultural, and mythical references.  I am pleased that the elderly and young are shown to rise to selflessness, and courage alongside the adults in their prime.  The possibilities of human nature are explored and on full display.  This season rather than have aggressively evil figures such as the governor, or the sanctuary crew, we watched the struggles of the ""regular folk"" Alexandrians as the presence of Rick et al challenged their precarious community code.  Not enough Daryl this season; too much Morgan.  He hurt Carol.  Done with him.  I did not quite believe the scene in the season finale when Tara and Rosita burst in upon the ""wolf"" and his hostage. Unlike some reviews and blogs, I did enjoy the episodes in Alexandria, and I continue to be a fan of Rick.  I think Andrew Lincoln as created an iconic, modern day John Wayne type of character, but more along the line of Wayne's troubled, brooding Ethan in the ""Searchers"".",1449014400,,1208,4.764423076923077

BRAVO TO THE CAST WHO acted their parts so well, to the directors and producers for knowing how to interpret what the writers intended for us to see. It is my current belief, the weakness of Ep 8 was intentional, so that Ep. 9 could renew our faith in Dead-Kind. BRAVO!!! BRAVO!! BRAVO!

7140488,5,B00WNBABVC,"When I go wandering in the woods alone, I sometimes feel like I'm in a zombie movie running away from The Walking Dead. That's the affect this whole season had on me. If I were Darly Dixon, I wouldn't use a bow and arrow. I wouldn't use guns either. I would build a camera with chrono controls to freeze the walkers in space and time continuum. I would go scouting for food and when I am safe, I'd unfreeze them and sit and watch them ragdoll fall their way.

Chinaman is alive. He is tough.

I think Robert Kirkman has created a comic world loved by many. Every character he introduced thus far has their own story line and he keeps expanding it in a way that makes you want your favorite character to survive each episode - the part which I like the most, well scripted and filmed. I loved the drone footage in few episodes and I think this is the best television series ever made.",1449014400,,883,4.25

Two of the other Limited Edition seasons were only $65 on release day and they look better and do more. The best Limited Edition season so far has been the Season 3 with the walker head tanks and even that was only $95 on release day. If Season 3 can have removable zombie heads and fish tanks that light up and it was only $95, how can this season cost $40 more and do absolutely nothing except open up? Ridiculous.

7140567,5,B00WNBABVC,"AAAAAAH! I LOVE THIS SERIES! I swear, if this show ends, and it will, I don't care if zombies rule the world because what would be the point of living?",1448928000,,151,4.066666666666666
7140568,2,B00WNBABVC,"This should be called The Tedious Living because basically the scripts are all predicated on the idea that viewers aren't going to engage their grey matter but instead will just gape with mouths open at the endless ""action"" sequences that intersperse what is essentially yet another soap opera.

Naturally anything with zombies occupying a central plot role isn't going to rely on verisimilitude but TWD takes audience credulity beyond any limit. Want to blow up a tank? Roll a grenade down the barrel (yes, really...). Want to recycle the endless lame ""drop your guns, slide them over to me"" routine? Oh yes. Brave band of survivors apparently unable to run without tripping at the most inopportune moments? You betcha. Hollywood rounds (my favorite so far, a 9mm with a 15-round mag that fired 23 shots without requiring a reload) in abundance. And a complete lack of situational awareness coupled to total cluelessness about how to move across contested terrain? Yes sir!

So in short this is a series for people who want to stroke their shotgun barrel while sitting on the sofa eating popcorn and imagining how they'd fare if the zombie apocalypse ever arrived. Fortunately no one suffers from toothache or appendicitis or any other medical problem. Amazingly none of the characters needs any sort of regular medication despite the real-world fact that US citizens are basically addicted to pharmaceuticals and, thanks to the obesity epidemic, would drop dead within days without access to a pharmacy. In this little violent fantasy world in which unskilled civilians double-tap like highly trained SEALs, life is basically pretty good.

If you like real-world human drama that may actually teach you something this series is best avoided. There are better parodies out there than this seemingly endless self-parody. But if you love watching people shooting at the undead (so much more politically correct than some real-life alternatives that were on offer in the USA not so long ago) and don't mind scripts that are as stale as the zombies themselves (trust me, some of these scenes really truly stink) then why not pull up a chair and sleep through an episode or two?",1448928000,,2174,5.033333333333333

7140572,4,B00WNBABVC,"I've enjoyed most of this so far.  I can see they are continuing to evolve the characters.  Now that we are all used to the zombies eatting of the living, the real dangers of humans to humans is what stocks the flames of this walking dead.  They are bringing some new plotlines from the comics (the introduction of Negan episode 8).  Interesting to see how that develops, as in the comics one of the major characters is killed (I won't say who). Of course, it may not be the same in the show, but still feel the hand of doom already on a much, beloved character.",1448928000,,562,4.273584905660377

7140575,4,B00WNBABVC,"It's your standard walking dead season full of drama twisting plot and gut wrenching loss. The always popular ""Who the Heck was that guy?"" Followed by hours of arguing about who's good, who's bad and weather or not Rick has finally lost it. The cherry on top is the catastrophe of unexpected events that are intertwined in a way that makes me think of final destination. Its like the writers try to see how close they can get you to the edge of never watching it again and then, RIP your attention back like a defibrillator shock to  a flat line.  That being said it wasn't the worst season and it wasn't the best. I'd say its in my top 3.watched every episode and I'm not ashamed. (Hope I didn't make any REAL fans upset with my review.)",1448928000,,738,4.340579710144928
7140576,3,B00WNBABVC,"I have HUGE love for the show and the special editions AMC releases but this special edition was definitely not worth the $134...... I just got it today and excepted the package be much heavier then it was. When I opened up the box,  I thought it was going to empty lol it wasn't thankfully. The asphalt walker box is cool and has nice detail but weighs next to nothing unlike the previous bluray editions. The other editions are much heavier and seem to be built to last not to mention they have more to them like cool extras features. For example the tree walker movement and walker head fish tanks led lights. This edition is very subpar and maybe worth $60-$70. I know I paid much less for the previous editions so I have no clue why this edition is the most out of all of them. Very disappointed but still happy to add this to my walking dead collection.",1448928000,12,859,4.3354037267080745

Plus, they're using ""sponge time,"" which tells me they're not doing well on the creativity scene.  ""Sponge time"" arises from classroom teachers' use of class time when they've completed a lesson and do not want to begin the next one for lack of adequate time.

7140616,4,B00WNBABVC,"The premise of the series (not just the season) is that of a world infested with the living dead. Its a theme that probably goes even father back than Richard Matheson's 'I am legend', with actors like Will Smith and Charton Heston gracing the solitary landscape at various times in cine history. Its a theme thats haunting, chilling and immensely absorbing. Its a 'what-if' world. While there have been takes and retakes, hits and misses, tongue in cheek spoofs, as in ZombieLand, nothing to date comes close to this extremely gritty, taut and well directed series. While it was easy to have brushed past the average beginnings to this series, I hung in there through the first season, and was amply rewarded by this edge of the seat AMC TV Series. It is macabre and gruesome, but if you can stomach all that, you will find the acting, story and direction superb. The chemistry amongst the characters is strong with the good and bad characters playing their roles to almost perfection, and eventually blurring what little separates the two. The brooding Norman Reedus, the tortured and conflicted Andrew Lincoln, and the entire cast play their roles with so much conviction its hard not to believe such a world as we seem them in cannot exist sometime in the future.

The only reason I knock off a star is because the show overplays  the human emotional interplay and underplays the science and logic that might have added an interesting twist to the theme.",1448582400,,1458,4.781746031746032

The way the show framed Glen's death in episode 3 was pathetic, I have access to the episode Glenn fell into a crown of zombies & reviewed it several times there was no way the other character was on him when he hit the ground..  If you have access to episode 3 watch it for your self.

Then all of a sudden episode 7 shows the other character on Glenn as the zombies tear him apart .. LAME !!!!

7140679,5,B00WNBABVC,"*SPOILERS*

Still love The Walking Dead, even though some ""fans"" are saying they ""jumped the shark"" with the ""is Glenn dead or isn't he?"" shenanigans.  In my opinion it's all in good fun and didn't make me feel like I was being treated like I was stupid in the slightest.  It's meant to be entertainment, after all.  If it makes you feel stupid, don't get your undies in a wad, just don't watch it.  But I'm not sure how enjoying an entertaining TV show can make you feel stupid.  You may want to pretend you're watching some Shakespearean play because of the serious and deep subject matter, along with the great acting, but let's face it; it's a soap opera!!  Albeit, a zombie soap opera, but it is still a serial where you get emotionally involved.  I'm GLAD Glenn survived the Nicholas fiasco; he didn't deserve such an ignominious death and he's one of my favorite characters.  I know they'll be plucking them off one-by-one, but I will likely be watching until the ""last man is standing"" (Daryl?  Or maybe it will be Judith or Carol, and not a man at all?)  Hopefully they will be able to continue telling us interesting stories about our favorite zombie apocalypse heroes for some time to come.

02/2018 EDIT:  I loved this show for a long time, but now I think they've killed it.  Glenn was the heart of the show.  Everything about the show has gone downhill since they brutally killed him off.... and for what? To keep to the comic book? They've strayed from that before and the reason was that this is TV, not a comic book. This used to be a compelling story about characters that felt real in an unreal situation. Now, for some reason they have decided to write the characters we used to love as caricatures. And killing off Carl?  Another stupid move.  Figure it out showrunners and writers! Otherwise you can stick a fork in this once great series.",1448409600,2,1861,4.523952095808383

But on the emotional front, my gosh! This season is leading on the emotional end. You really don't know what to expect from each episode. I'm finding myself on edge, practically waiting for Sundays to come. I start counting down the days as soon as a new episode finishes, and then on the day of the new episode, I count down the hours and then the minutes....like...It's really bad! Every episode has its own flavor and story to tell within the entire seasonal arc. I must say for season six I have been experiencing intense emotional manipulation from some of the episodes! I started off excited, then I was left with fear .Then I felt hopeful which led me to dread. And while I'm still feel down, I'm feel horrified about what's going to happen next. Gah!

7140817,4,B00WNBABVC,"As always, this show is edgy, fast moving, well written and well acted. Though its story line is brutal, it is, when all is said and done, an excellent character study of humans under prolonged stress and trauma. It certainly does not follow any standard formula for episodic television! Main characters are no less vulnerable to death than a non-speaking bit player. Its been a wild ride and I will miss the show when it is done and gone! Always worth watching.",1448064000,,462,4.646341463414634

7140826,4,B00WNBABVC,"Generally speaking, still going pretty strong with action but the angst and intrigue of earlier seasons maybe falling off.

Its different every show and no one is safe, even the main characters are not safe as we've all seen in the past. This makes the show more realistic than the horror movies that are the same even though they have 10 different versions. Its the maniac chasing people through the woods and slicing them up. This show you never know what is around the next corner, who's the next to fall to a world of zombies and where the group will end up.

The feeling is beginning to wane.  I don't care much for the way they are breaking everything up, leaving us hanging, same stories, different faces, that odd mid-season break.  Wonder what they're going to leave us to wonder about until it comes back on again in 2016.  And now they have Badlands coming on before Talking Dead.
It's starting to feel like one of those bad relationships that you stay in for some unknown reason and he gives you just enough to keep you hanging.  I'm starting to get over it just like I did with him.",1447545600,2,774,4.579710144927536

On the down side there are too many new characters besides the leftover cast from season five. The mystery surrounding Glen's fate needs to be resolved soon to keep the series moving.

What should also be clear is the that this show might be the best drama on television today. No, I am not a fan of zombies, zombie movies, or horror film. That being said TWD is living up to the poster I read once concerning the show 'kill the dead, fear the living'. The drama comes from the human beings trying to survive. I started watching the show because I didn't want to be an adult afraid of elaborate make-up and special effects. I now find myself at work on Sundays wondering what one human being will do,or have to do, to another in order to survive.",1447286400,,662,4.304

If the 90 minute episode featuring Lennie James (Morgan) doesn't win any type of Emmy award, either for best writing, directing, best lead actor performance, etc.then the whole system is rigged!  Lennie James DESERVES an Emmy Award for his performance in that episode!! This show is not all about horror and zombies, although, yes, that is a big part of it, however it's REALLY about the characters, their story lines, where they came from, how they have changed...It's definitely a character-driven show. That's why we get so upset when they kill off a beloved character (still can't believe they killed off Andrea, Beth, Hershel and now possibly Glenn) with Maggie being pregnant and all. I want to at least know that Glenn knows he's becoming a father. I sure hope Maggie is able to give birth naturally without any complications like Lori had. Hate to say it but in that post walker/biter/roamer-apocalyptic world, maybe it will be a blessing if she has a miscarriage... I know a lot of fans might not like hearing me say that, but just trying to be realistic about such a bleak future it would be for pregnant women during that time. Oh, so much more to write about! I could go on and on. I watched a marathon of the first 3 seasons on Netflix even though I've already seen every episode multiple times before, just wanted a refresher since my memory of the earlier seasons gets a little hazy at times. There are things I've missed before that was worth a second look at the past episodes.

The only drawback with some of the writing is a few noticeable inconsistencies, the first one going back to Season 1 where Rick doesn't know how to hot wire that car so he takes the horse into Atlanta instead, which quickly gets devoured by walkers. Then later, he is able to hot wire a car for Glenn to drive off back to camp with the car alarm blaring...huh? Or when after Lori dies at the prison, Rick bloodies and sweat a lot by slaughtering countless walkers to find Lori's remains, then in the next scene, he is completely cleaned up with a fresh set of clothes on, huh?

I am really anxious and excited for Rick to have a new love interest in Jessie. I just hope for Rick's sake she stays alive for awhile or he'll grow even colder. He needs a good woman like Jessie who isn't afraid to tell him what's what like she does. I don't like the idea of Rick and Michonne. I think they make great friends and confidants but I hope it doesn't lead to anything more. I'm really hoping Michonne gets together with Morgan - they already seem to be developing a bit of chemistry of his so-called missing peanut butter protein bar....ha ha ha...",1447200000,,2671,4.525879917184265

7141096,3,B00WNBABVC,"I'm reviewing the last episode of season 6 ""Trouble is inside and outside the gate,"" playing off of the episode that saw the Ws get into the compound, just before this episode. I'm writing this review because we think that any humans in this position would be discussing ways to prevent further attacks and breakthroughs in the perimeter, and put on hold love stories and emotional problems. It's human nature to go into survival mode until the threat is dealt with. It is not human nature to want to have sex or discuss long term human relations when you think your life in danger. I know some of you will disagree with that, but it is true. There is plenty of time to have those interaction in this series, but not right on top of the after math of murderous criminals breaking easily through their perimeter and murdering them. That's a little hard to swallow.

It's interesting from a tactical point of view, and my friend and I both had this same problem with the entire series. We both have military background, and we understand the imperative nature of secure perimeters and tactically advantageous positioning. We were trained that way. This is a good episode to critique in that there is a bonified military person in their ranks, Abraham, but we don't even see him advising Rick on perimeter defenses. Let me tell you something. ANY military person trained in tactical defense will immediately be looking for perimeter defense possibilities upon this type of activity--you know, the zombies, bad people, etc. It's drilled into us. Yet, nothing so far. (One exception is that Rick did bring up the supports for the wall being a possible way into the compound.)

That said, tactical strategy is mostly common sense, except for the physics of trajectory flight. And then, a basic understanding of that can be gotten from simple experience suffices. For instance, if you have high ground, your projectiles have a greater distance than you opponents--you're firing downhill, while they must fire uphill. In a close situation, that isn't going to matter. But when using arrows or hand held projectiles, it means the difference between winning and losing. Think of it as dropping rocks down a mine shaft onto your enemy while he or she must throw them up to hit you. It is the exact same principle.

That's just one example of tactically advantageous positioning, but like I was saying, it becomes fairly common sensical if you are in such a situation where you experience it first hand.

So with that said, enter TWD.

So Rick is pretty good at understanding tactically advantageous positioning, and perhaps they will have a discussion on how to ""harden"" their position in the next episode. Perhaps they will not because we have seen the characters make huge tactical mistakes, commonsensical things you would not think people in their situation would make over and over again. Let's start and end with their current situation.

First, the fence was built wrong, and any architect would know that. The force is coming from outside, therefore you put the supports on the INSIDE. Can anyone see that? It's one of those common sense types things where force coming from one direction is met with resistance front the opposite. Think of it as if someone is pushing you backwards. You automatically extend one of your legs out and to your back, opposite side of where the force is coming. The same principle applies to any support.  Like I said, any architect would understand that. Pretty hard to understand how the writers could have an architect build something like that.

Rick noticed that in some degree. When he first got there, he said, which is also correct, that anyone wanting to get inside could simply climb the outside supports and jump the wall. For any one constructing a base, that would have been a top priority to fix, before any other construction was performed. But, they failed to do it and sure enough, they came over the top.

I would also like to say that a properly hardened position will require  three times the number of people to overcome it. That means if you are in a fortified position, say a castle, and it has been built properly, it will take your opponents three times the resources to defeat you, all things being equal. That means three times the personnel, three times the ammo, etc. So let's move on.

So now from the last episode we saw that there was a great concern by Carol that the Ws  would find the armory and use the guns on the towns good people. This concern is CORRECT! You NEVER want to leave ordinance lying around for others to use on you. Thus, priority number two, after the fence or at the same time, would be to build a secure armory for the ordinance and firearms. Yet, they haven't even discussed that yet. Currently, the ordinance is behind a household door and nothing else. Next.

The fence is good, and it might even stop a large tractor trailer from going through it. However, the entrance is weak and will not stop a large vehicle from plowing through. This is known by the residence because they discuss it referring to the character who shot out the driver and caused the truck to hit a stronger place in the fence. The solution is to use, for instance, seatrains or large tractor trailers (turned on their sides) to make a corridor heading up the entrance, one that requires at least two switch back turns, in order to slow any hostile from getting any speed.

Perimeter defense. The fence simply needs reinforcement from large vehicle attacks. We already know the people of the town are resourceful and have access to heavy equipment. It would be quite easy to round up the necessary trailers and or seatrains and put those around the outside of the fence. You would want to leave enough space between each trailer for personnel to move though, but only at strategic locations. Those are called ""kill areas."" They call them kill areas because they represent the place where it is easiest to get through the first perimeter. Of course, you would have your gunners already zeroed in on those locations, and when they come through, they are an easy target. You make it as hard as your situation allows for them to go right through the hardest aspect of the perimeter. Sure, they can hook up to the trailers and try to tow them off, but that takes lots of time and they are getting shot at the entire time. And that's what you are buying in a situation like this. It's a war of attrition. If you make to hard enough, your opponents will stop. You can also use heavy equipment to build up a dirt berm around the fence, making sure it is no too high, depending on how high the fence is. That was you can still fire down past the burn from the fence onto the enemy, making sure your berm gives them no cover at all. A six foot berm with a high angle of attack will stop just about any non tracked vehicle, until the attackers can dig out of it.  Again, as one builds these things, it becomes common sense about how to build them. You can also use sandbags about two feet from the fence, 4' high, 4' deep which absorb any impact, saving the fence.

Clear all vegetation, including trees, around the entire town for at least 100 yards. That makes it necessary for attackers to be in the open for 100 yards before they reach your perimeter. Easy kills.

Last, when constructing any position, you want a fall back area, which will also be fortified. It's also where your first line of tactical planning takes place, the field planners that plan how to defeat the attackers. And, you want a last fall back position where your higher ranking planners are, they can be outfitting in a tower with binoculars, in this show's instance, for spotting enemy movement, and then relayed to the other tactical position planners.

So in summary, the people in Rick's group should well know that priority one is:
(1) Front entry reinforcement.
(2) Wall reinforcement with kill pathways.
(3) Moving wall support beams to the INSIDE (geeze, really writers?).
(4) Hardened fall back positions inside of the wall.
(5) Hardened armory with very limited access (inside of a seatrain which has been barricaded from all but one entry point, with multiple pathway obstructions (locked steel doors, gunmen, check points).
(6) Having a treeless open area at least 100 yards all around the perimeter. That way any attackers must move over 100 years of open area.

I think most humans in this particular situation would be screaming about how to harden their position. That's because it is human instinct to go into survival mode, and part of that is reinforcing your position. This lack of planning has us cringing when we fail to see any of it. It's just not realistic with a law enforcement person and a military person in Ricks group.",1447027200,26,8771,4.683766233766233

7141141,2,B00WNBABVC,"'SPOILERS'
'Now' reveals how truly stuck in the mud this show really is.
The plot is ridiculous ! Perhaps the largest walker hoard in the history of this show is at the gates of the only known piece of civilization remaining on earth and the community members decide to wander off into their own little make believe worlds, baking cookies and getting drunk, while their leader decides to review the plans for next season's crops, ITS ABSURD !
I can only conclude that the current residents of the community are not its original inhabitants because there is no way this bunch of self pitied fools constructed the wall and built a sustainable infrastructure.
The dialog is atrocious ! Maggie's tunnel rant highlights the mush of disconnected sentences that form the script. Maggie doesn't even make sense when delivering a monologue, never mind when two or more characters interact. A perfect example is when the boy approaches Rick, who is on watch at the wall, to explain the incident between himself and Rick's son. Rick begins to leave, to check on his son, only to be dissuaded by the boy on the guise of showing him how to shoot a gun.
What's going on in Rick's mind ? It should already be dramatic enough that Rick struggles with the priorities of abandoning his watch on the wall in order to check on the welfare of his son, only to flippantly dismiss this struggle for the new highest priority of showing a kid how to use a gun. ITS RIDICULOUS !
The community has no intention of fortifying their defenses against the hoard and, even if they did, cannot effectively communicate with each other in order to put a plan in to action.
At this point I'm rooting for the hoard to knock down the wall and feast on the entire community.",1447027200,,1735,4.6

I did think it was odd in the  set up where she gives that women crap about smoking but it made some sense later on when she see's her out the window. It was an awkward set up but I appreciated the payoff. I liked the recent stand alone episode with Morgan, Lennie James, and equally great character actor John Carroll Lynch playing Eastman. It was just such a tease while rabid fans are gnashing their teeth at the thought of Glenn or Rick fate. That being said, I hated the bad black and white flashbacks in the premiere.

7141299,5,B00WNBABVC,"I concur with everything Michael said- the show is NOT about the zombies.  Initially, I avoided watching the show because while channel flipping all I seemed to catch was scenes where people were being attacked.  That was until the scene where the group came upon Hershel's farm.  Being an animal lover, I had to watch and make sure the animals were kept safe and before that show was over I was hooked.  I have my own horse farm and while I was concerned for the animals being kept safe, I became invested in the group's safety and how they learned to work together to survive.  And, then of course, learning to deal with the living who were a danger to the group- like Shane and others.
going to happen next.  There was a time when I couldn't think about anything except the show, waiting with such great anticipation to the next episode to see what was going to happen next and how the group would persevere.  Watching characters like Daryl and Carol evolve has been amazing!  I miss Hershel, but am glad he was part of the group at least for a time.  I also miss Beth and her beautiful voice and her wonderful innocence to life.

It makes me think about the future of our own world and the things we do as a society to destroy it.  I think some people are afraid to think that at the rate we are going, we are headed in this direction.  Maybe there will be nuclear war or maybe due to chemical warfare or something similar we will all be forced off the grid and learn how to survive by going back to the basics.  This show makes one think, ""what if...""  What would each of do to survive?",1446854400,5,1591,4.295302013422819

7141303,4,B00WNBABVC,"I don't know why some of these episodes are considered so ""ambitious"", but they are great.  Having said that, I realized that I am getting put off this season by the new turn, aka: ""Kill, Kill, Kill"", that the show has taken.

I never watched it because I enjoyed the gore;  I enjoyed watching the ways the characters coped with and relationships evolved and developed and maintained their humanity in spite of their environment.  The show works somewhat similarly to ""Breaking Bad"" in that aspect, except that the worlds are reversed.

However, I've had to cover my eyes for parts of some episodes and I've never had to do that before.

And why the heck did you kill off Glenn?  Is Maggie pregnant?  My bet is yes.",1446854400,,715,4.574803149606299

The episode ""Here's Not Here"" is incredible... should win an award if there is any justice in the entertainment industry.  For those of you who think this show is about zombies, please think again.  It is not.  It is about people, characters, drama, etc.  The zombies are there to push the characters along, in order to tell the REAL story.

7141361,5,B00WNBABVC,"The Walking Dead has to be viewed from the beginning.  It can be pure zoned-out entertainment.  If you look somewhat deeper, you can see the stereotyped personalities, how they are portrayed dealing with psychosocial and other stresses, as well as how humans hypothetically form social groups (civilization) under constant threat.  In this case the constant threat is the Zombies.  However, recall that it was not that many years ago when death of a mother during childbirth was not uncommon, and usually the baby's life was saved first (e.g. caesarian).

If you can turn off all of the analytics for a while, I would call this a guilty pleasure, as some people refer to the occasional chocolate bar.

If you have to wonder how they make the zombies, you're missing the fun part of it.",1446768000,,785,4.82089552238806

I didn't think to watch the walking dead when it had came out but after going to universal horror nights I wanted to see what the big commotion over it was about. After I watched one episode I have been hooked ever since. I'm always waiting for Sunday to roll back around.

It's about gripping suspense, twists, and character development.  If you're not watching it, you're missing an epic show on par with Breaking Bad, Homeland, and Game of Thrones.

7141485,2,B00WNBABVC,"I was absolutely a Die Hard fan in Seasons 1 and 2.  Season 3 was a struggle to get through. Season 4 somewhat redeeming.  Season 5 was up and down.  Nonetheless, I eagerly maintained that the old Walking Dead filmic fascination would reappear in the very next episode.  Practically held my breath in wait for each season's first episode, the mid-season, and the grand finale.  It had to get better, I knew it would, it had to.  But #@!#?  Im not even sure what I'm watching anymore -- a big guy showing a little guy how to wield a Zen stick, some cooking tips, a naughty goat, that was the entire show!  Meanwhile, zombies popped up like groundhogs in a pop up box.  Thats all I got out of the 11/1/15 episode.  The producers and directors of The Walking Dead are full of themselves.  In the first couple of seasons they emancipated the zombie stereotype, building it into something sublimely artful -- now they are taking just as much liberty in ruining it.  Maybe the success was too much for them.  Well, I never thought it was about them anyway -- Id LOVE to see the producers and directors get eaten by zombies -- please someone mutiny the set, seize the script and write that scene into it.  Maybe then we will see on The Walking Dead what weve been waiting for.  Writers rock  and so do all of the many people it takes to produce a TV show -- but when you take away a main character, the actor, that youve put so much into building  then it becomes boring and hopeless.  If those main characters are truly unessential, and easily replaced, then most certainly the rest of the film crew from the very top to bottom can be easily replaced too, oh yes.  There IS nothing more important in a show than the actor that can turn the switch on from typewritten script to film.  When youve got a story line thats going nowhere, no new plots, nothing new weve found out about the post-apocalyptic world in a seemingly very long time, all youve got is those characters to hang on to.  As of this writing, all The Walking Dead is about is getting rid of the characters we cant live without, ensuring that all the show has left is dead ends.

7141501,4,B00WNBABVC,The first episode of the season was exciting. The plot was good. Acting was great as usual.  The only complaint is the storytelling. Flipping back and forth between past in black and white and present in color got old pretty quick.  By half way through the episode the gimmick was tiring. By the end it was downright irritating.,1446508800,,328,4.637931034482759

7141531,5,B00WNBABVC,"This is a review of Episode 10. Not to be a nit picker or anything....this show rocked and I LOVE the new character ""Jesus"". OK...first when Carl and Little Ass Kicker are sitting on the porch he's pointing out stars. I've found in this show that the quiet moments have meaning and come back around to save someone's life. Carl tells Judith ""...see, that's the North Star, it's lives in the Little Dipper and it's red, you follow it and you'll always find your way home"". The North Star does not live in the Little Dipper. You trace the two stars that form the outer edge of the Big Dipper up, and that is the North Star. The North Star is not red. The North Star is Polaris, a yellow super giant star that shines with the brightness of 2500 of our Sun. It sits at true celestial North and all other stars in our sky wheel around it. So Carl, get it right if you're trying to help out your sister. I know, she's a baby...but still, it's the Walking Dead and her name is ""Little Ass Kicker"". Ok...Second, when Rick and Daryl are coming back with ""new character, Jesus"" I noticed a new sign on their gate. It said: ""Welcome to the Alexandria Safe Zone. Mercy for the Lost- Vengeance for the Plunderers."".......what the heck does Vengeance for the Plunderers, mean? Why would people that plunder need vengeance, and why would the folks in Alexandria have any thing to do with that? Did the village idiot write the sign? Shouldn't it read; ""Vengeance for the Plundered?"" Someone help me out here? Other than these two solids points, this show ROCKS BALLS!!! Best Show EVER. Maybe even better than Vikings?? Oops. I didn't say that.",1446422400,,1627,4.5

The subplots (no discernable plot for a couple seasons now) for season 6 are completely without any substance whatsoever.  The characters could be doing any damn thing.  The zombies are almost irrelevant, becoming comical.  Time to start killing the main characters.

7141803,5,B00WNBABVC,"I am writing this review on only the most recent episode 3 of season 6 - but the process is an ongoing, most essential element of the show as a whole. In this episode, the zombies ate Glen - one if the most central and enduring characters in the core group. Sure, this is only a tv show. But as I continue to watch the twists and turns of the ever-suspenseful plot unfold, I find myself becoming attached to varying degrees with the main characters. So, when one of them is suddenly and unexpectedly lost, I feel some sadness at their demise. For me, Glen was one of them. So who is next? Man, I sure hope we don't lose Carol - the group needs her resourcefulness and courage. Please contact your congressperson to stand up and express their support for Carol's survival...

7141837,5,B00WNBABVC,"So far, so good, although it was rather confusing to go from the zombie roundup which went exactly the way one has come to expect and then have that just kind of...dropped in the second episode... And btw, how did they get all of those walkers in that quarry pit in the first place?? Definitely some great shakeups thus far with lots of suspenseful moments and some questions answered, but(spoiler) the removal of one of the favorites is every bit as upsetting as when Herschel lost his head. Humans can endure a great deal but one thing they can't live without is hope. This latest pruning took away the hope. It remains to be seen if the rest of the season pans out to help restore any of that previous commodity.",1446163200,,715,4.465648854961832

Instead of doing the expected thing of reestablishing where all our characters are psychologically and especially Morgan, a new member to the team, they decide to give the whole community a big crisis to deal with. This makes Rick's murder of the doctor and public freak out with a gun fade because his leadership is needed in the chasm left by Deanna's mourning the loss of her husband. This episode is really a two parter because we still don't know what happened to the herd of walkers. Good stuff.",1446076800,,531,4.659574468085107

7141851,5,B00WNBABVC,"I have watched the Walking Dead from the very beginning.  I have enjoyed every episode that I have seen.  Season 6 promises to be even better than the previous seasons.  It started off at a dead run and after 3 episodes, the show's producers have maintained the tension and  ""edge of your seat""  excitement, and leaving me with the hope that these apocalypse survivors will somehow find a way to survive another episode.

I love all the main characters in the show.  I feel that all the actors give their all to their craft and that is a big part of the reason why I love this show so much.  The production staff have put together an amazing group of actors.  The great Greg Nicotero has a fantastic ability to make zombies believable in prosthetic make-up and has a way of dealing with everyone that he is loved.  Robert Kirkman has also written great source material from which the show draws from, The Walking Dead comic books.

I sincerely hope that this show goes on for several more seasons.  It is that good!",1446076800,,1015,4.4863387978142075

7141923,5,B00WNBABVC,"The series is not about zombies.  This series is about the struggle of life in a world filled with zombies.  People get the wrong idea saying""I don't really like zombie stuff"" because the idea is that zombies are disgusting and vile but the scariest part of the series is people killing people because of misunderstandings or turf or invasion.  What the public must understand is the people are the scariest.  A zombie killing a person is like a lion killing a gazelle,it's going to happen.  But a person killing a person,is unnatural.  Now that is what is most powerful to me.  In order to survive you have to take life.  That's scary forget the zombies.",1446076800,,655,4.6347826086956525

The glitches appeared in the same general areas on both sets that I received. They also acted up in someone else's player. This is not Amazon's fault as they must have received some defective product from their supplier. They are probably not aware of it so I do not blame them at all. Thankfully they have a VERY GOOD exchange policy with quick shipping of the replacement product. As for the show itself, and season 5 in particular, it's great.",1445990400,,571,4.5

I understood the reasoning behind the black and white effect but viewing the episode through the PS3 it came across a little grainy and hard to see in some spots - this could be the system and not the episode, not sure. The characters of Alexandria continue to frustrate me to no end, and they definitely amped up the production value this season. So. Many. Zombies.",1445990400,,458,4.464285714285714

What's worth living for? What's the point of all of this? And so on.

But the thing is that this is the third Walking Dead season pass I've purchased on Amazon. So this leads me to wonder: Why on Earth can't we buy multi-season passes? And why don't my previous season passes in any way count toward future season passes? I'm not saying I don't like The Walking Dead, because I think it's the best show on TV in a long time, I'm just saying that this Amazon season pass business needs to be worked out and improved.",1445904000,,731,4.2214285714285715

1. The Truck Horn, could not possibly carry that distance, they would have never heard it. If they heard the truck horn they would have heard the gun fire.
2. When they got back the buildings were burned down. There was not enough time for the buildings to go completely out, they would have at the very least still be smouldering and hot, and you would have seen a fire of that size from where they were at.",1445904000,2,478,4.382022471910112

7142051,3,B00WNBABVC,"This is not an unfavorable review and there are no Season 6 spoilers.  I binged watched every Season episode without commercials and I still experience TWD as an OK thriller drama.  These are my ten reasons for this rating:

 1. It is illogical.  The Zombies herds can be lured, trapped and killed by fire. Yet, the surviving humans can not seem to develop ways to exterminate Zombies out of one small town.

2.  The group goes in and out of the city and the one place that I would think they would select, (Grady Hospital) due to the security is the one place they leave. For months, they complained about lack of medical care, food, water, guns and then they leave the hospital which has all of these things for the misery of the woods.

3. It is very, very difficult to grab a tame or wild horse with your bare hands. Nonetheless a group of Zombies with rotting flesh can easily grab, pull down and manage of tear open a living horse in less than 30 seconds.  Some writer apparently hates horses, because Zombies have killed at least four horses.

4. A rotting human body has an unreal, disgusting funk, it is the kind of odor the creates immediate nausea.  Nonetheless, no one can smell Zombies, they have to listen for them.  Zombies make noise, except when they are trying to attack from behind.  So it is very easy to get a surprise attacked and eaten.

5. Every time they went out on a run, no one ever thought about, getting some barb wire fencing, so that at least the Zombies could not walk on the farm and eat people and animals.

6. Baby Judith always looks fat and healthy.  Yet for days she has not had anything to eat except forest food. How is her diaper being cleaned? How are the women cleaning themselves after a period?  They all seem to be very comfortable wearing skin tight jeans in hot weather walking along in the Georgia woods, full of all kinds of insects.  Listen up writer, in hot weather your garments are loose fit pants, the looser the better.

7. The writers try to make sense out of nonsense.  In the prison, Rick wanted to kill all the inmates, immediately, but then changed his mind due to their pleadings.  Out of the prison, Rick did not want to kill the Governor, and never attempted to kill him, even though he knew the man was a totally crazy psycho.

8. The Governor is smarter than Rick, because he trapped wandering Zombies.  A trapped Zombie is easier to kill than a walking Zombie. The Governor managed for months a very safe community and never once had any problems with keeping a woman. Rick was basically under Hershel's authority and killed a best friend that wanted his wife.

9. The stupidity of Beth thinking a small bandage scissor would penetrate a bullet proof vest.  Beth, walk to Rick, take his gun and shoot the woman in the head at a safe distance.

10. The Zombies are rotting corpses, they are not really Zombies which are alive but unable to communicate.  So where are the vultures and ravens, eating the Zombies?  Where are all the insect flesh eaters?  Every Zombie encountered should be eaten down to the bones or covered head to toe with the bugs that feed off dead flesh.

Finally,there is no such creature as a virus that is 100% lethal, someone in these episodes should be immune to the Zombie virus.

The Walking Dead is a comic book, graphic novel story.  It is not a classic horror fiction, such as Dracula, Frankenstein, etc, etc.  The characters do everything against surviving, because no one can give up their craziness long enough.  No one has any faith in any religion.  In fact, the episodes are basically religious free, except for a rare ten second view of a Biblical text.  Yet, they all believe that human effort will lead them to a safe place.  Trying to figure out which character survives or dies represents TWD's foundation thrill quest.  TWD is very similar to viewing a slasher film and guessing which person or persons will end up making it to the end of the movie  Except TWD has millions of monsters.  It's an average thriller soap opera drama with wonderful special effects and makeup.  It is not the best TV show and it is not the worst either.",1445904000,4,4141,4.504697986577181

7142053,5,B00WNBABVC,"Let us talk about Walking SHOES for a moment.  Throughout the seasons, I've never spotted a shoe-less or barefoot  Walker. The thousands of potential footwear shoppers are flitting about the countryside wearing the STURDIEST footwear ever cobbled together by a cobbler!. Apparently, our Walker friends are keeping an eye ( or two ) out for any shoe stores they may wander by, in order to take a breather to  roam the aisles for an appropriate pair of shoes suitable for the climate, the terrain, distance, urgency,...etc..  Are there any good ole Thom McAns sprinkled about on the Eastern seaboard  of the U.S. anymore?  Just wondering................................  I'm actually writing this to relieve my heartbreak of losing a fellow South Korean character/actor to the Walking Dead.

I hope the other spoilers are right and he's not really dead, because guess what? The show is not going to be as good without him!  I know its a zombie show but c'mon I just bought this whole season! Why cant everybody's favorite lead characters live?!!!! It's not like the writers have followed the comic books thus far!  I bought season 6 because all the other seasons (especially season 5, none of the fav's died) were amazing, the drama just mesmerized me.

He was supposed to be the small and quick guy that gets in and gets out, then they played this little guy off to be a big bad tough guy who gets the girl and to me that transition just didn't make much sense.

Those who have not seen walking dead should see it. But seems the other show ""Fear the Walking dead"" is not garnering good ratings on IMDB.

At the very end of episode 4, like 2 seconds, it sounded like Glen saying, Rick! Open the gate. I still think that Rick and Glen both survived the attacks on episode 3, just needed re-assured. I can't imagine the show going on without them. Last week: TWD, Is the very best T.V. drama I have ever watched. Before I watched Season 1 episode 1, I had no use for Zombies at all. Turns out, this is more about how people, individuals, families come together to look for, and put together resources, to adapt, survive, when confronted with a major crisis, and have lost everything.

7142181,5,B00WNBABVC,"As usual, absolutely wonderful. Real to life in the sense of the decisions and how people react in difficult times of danger and sorrow. This show is not about Zombies, it is about a horrible living  condition and how you survive  and keep your humanity alive within it. It deals with personal ethics, moral codes and how that affects the greater good depending on your choices. I love the characters and frankly how season after season it does NOT lose the ability to surprise us the fans. Story writing and development is excellent in a category all by itself. The people who write, produce, act and collaborate in The Walking Dead really work well together and I mean really, really, really give it their best. I get a sense from what I have observed that these folks communicate  a whole lot with each other, listen a lot to one another and have a great agreement together on the final product. That is what has made them the number # 1 show on the planet. That is what their success is based on!",1445644800,4,1000,4.483516483516484

7142184,5,B00WNBABVC,This show just keeps on getting better and better. Nail biting suspense from the opening salvo. It's amazing to me some of the character arcs of the main group. I'm interested to see if some of the Alexandria people will step up and be important members of the group or continue to be dead weight and walker fodder.

7142270,4,B00WNBABVC,"Season 6 seems a little bit faster than season 5, but not that much. The creators of The Walking Dead continue to annoy us with slow moving scenes, long stares, characters asking questions and taking their sweet time to answer. Episode 1 was extremely disjointed, going back and forth between the present and the past. Then episode 2 instead of continuing with the cliffhanger, gave us an entirely different story. I'm not sure what they're doing, maybe they're trying to keep us surprised?

Why can't they stick to this simple formula? Killing Zombies + Interesting Situations = Great Programming

Why don't they explore character's motivations? On episode 2 a bunch of barbarians are invading that beautiful residential community with homes from the $800s. Why are they invading? Why do they have a ""W"" in their foreheads? We don't know! Will we know in the future? And why are they killing some while capturing others?

And what's the deal with the sheriff's son having that horrible haircut? Those bangs are hideous! I realize it's the apocalypse, but come on! Foreheads shouldn't be hidden!",1445558400,,1095,5.0054945054945055

  The 6th season continues to provide a thought provoking view into post-apocalyptic dynamics, which is what I find intriguing about the show.  The zombie-gore continues to escalate, with the special effects becoming more and more elaborate, grotesque, and revolting; regardless of the attractions of the more intellectual stimulation provided, if you can't handle that, stay away.  I'd say, otherwise go ahead and watch it, but I'm probably preaching to the converted here.

The Nurse sucks, Carl and his stupid haircut were too much to take, .the towns people are boring beyond watching.  This was without a doubt the absolute worst episode since this series started.

7142497,5,B00WNBABVC,"I agree completely about this not being a zombie show. In fact, I think as every season goes by it becomes less and less of a zombie show. Yes, they are there and we always have a few gory scenes with them. But by far that action that consumes us is the human to human tension as the remaining people struggle NOT to become zombies themselves.

It admittedly took me a bit to sink back into the show as this season began. The constant flashbacks of the first episode were not pulling me in but all of those zombies in the valley certainly did visually. However, with this last episode, which was dominated by Carol, I really was fully back into it. Carol is fast becoming a very favorite character. She is very clear about her perspective of what they are facing both now and for the future. She faces that bleak prospect with unrelenting fortitude. Her character was on display all of this latest episode on Oct 18th. This episode also brought to the forefront the human vs. human battle which is ongoing, each faction seeking to escape the zombie end for itself. The people they fight this time have let go of any pretense of civilization. They might as well be marauding beasts. Prior villains, like The Governor, at least had the veneer of civilization about them.

Whether I like it or not is almost beside the point though. This is referred to as AMC's ratings juggernaut. Neither ""Mad Men"" nor ""Breaking Bad"" ever achieved that status, excellent as they were. But here the viewing audience has clearly spoken, with both thumbs up.",1445472000,2,1537,4.585454545454546

When i bought episode SD version for 1.99, it was actually Hi-def still so they do not actually have an SD version for walking dead.

Pulp wood shredders are noisy.
The fog horn on a cargo ship is noisy.
They'll walk off a clif, into a whirley gig, into all kinds of things that will chop them into little bits or feed them to sharks.

Season 6 seemed to be just filler, no purpose, no further character development, a lot of focus on the secondary characters who quite frankly are not very good.  Whole season of focusing on them and they still are weak secondary characters.  The final episode should have been the first one of season 6. Then we could have had a great season, with a great villain and a new direction for the show. I think the only show that was any good was number 2, the rest just nothing.  Even the big finale where they FINALLY introduced a new villain, was not really that great. I will be back for season 7 but with a lot less enthusiasm.

Amazon needs to fix this problem, which I'm sure they are aware of.

This new season is off to a hell of a start.  The second episode has to rank amongst the top five episodes ever, and both episodes have really exceptional pacing.  The overall production seems to be a step up as well.  Very excited to see what's coming next!",1445212800,,578,4.296296296296297

7142636,5,B00WNBABVC,"I've loved every minute of TWD since season 1 episode 1. Started watching mainly because of Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption) and Gale Anne Hurd (too much cred to go into). For those who haven't followed this series, let me just say it's really not about zombies but instead what it means to be alive and human. This is a heavily character-driven drama with 'the dead' as antagonists. The characters are very sympathetic and the story is so engrossing, you'll forget your watching a television show. I'd go so far as to say it's better than 75% of the feature films I've seen in the last 5 years. However, with season 6 the production values, script, characters and story have been taken to a whole new level. It's a good season for new viewers because there is a kind of restart or full circle in the first episode. If this was just about the zombies and gore factor, it wouldn't have lasted 6 seasons and been one of the highest rated cable shows in history--just sayin'. Can't wait to see where TWD goes from here!",1445212800,4,1021,4.554347826086956

7142663,5,B00WNBABVC,"Fantastic. The one thing I absolutely love about this tv series is that the actors and actresses don't over dramatize any character. What I mean is all the characters are pretty much on the same level. I like how the characters look like normal people and they really seem like they just go with the flow. The detail and time put into this tv series has made it the best tv series of all time. I like how the characters that are weak get killed off and I like how the scene changes all the time. If they stayed in one place it would definitely get boring, almost like a rerun. I really like how the producers really made it more like a movie each episode, instead of a tv series.

7142668,5,B00WNBABVC,"So excited so far.  The entire first episode is one giant teaser and they definitely started the whole season off with a big bang in this one.  You'll still seeing your favorite characters evolve, but the director is doing a really good job of showing the story and events in just such a way that you are not exactly removed from the love you have from them, but are able to start to see them in a different light.  Everyone is wondering how far Rick is going to go, and whether he will actually become a tyrant.  Seeing that potential lurking under the surface gives you all the more reason to really root for him...and that's what is fascinating about his character: I am not sure if I am rooting for him to be the Hero we used to have, are become the new ruthless Rick that keeps his friends in check and his enemies in checkmate.  All I know for sure is that I can't wait to watch more, and if the first episode is any indication, TWD is definitely not done with give us thrills.",1445040000,,983,4.235294117647059
7142669,2,B00WNBABVC,"$42 for 1 season?  I don't think so.  AMC is throwing money away at that price point.

Update 10/26/15
So I'm 40% of the way through The Witcher 3 that I've played for 85 hours, paid $30 for and has every bit as much drama as The Walking Dead.  It's so good I signed up for the Expansion pass and had I know the game would be this good and bug free (so few PC games are lately) that I would have happily paid $60 for it during release.

Which brings me back to 16 episodes x 44 minutes each for $42 and all I can think is that this must be AMCs big middle finger to cord cutters, the big middle finger to people who are done watching the obscene amount of advertising brought to you on legacy television.

..which now brings be around to brand loyalty.  I feel like I got a great deal from ProjectRed and will continue to throw money at them in return for quality entertainment.  Alternatively, AMC wants the equivalent of an entire months worth of legacy television for one season of one show.  I don't know, maybe AMC IS Don Draper..  I sure feel like I need a thorough shower to wash AMC off.",1445040000,,1095,4.1469194312796205

7142682,5,B00WNBABVC,"The Walking Dead has finally returned for a new season (thank God!), and so far it looks like more amazing shows are headed our way. The season opener presents an enormous threat to the safety of Alexadria with the show's most humongous zombie horde so far. The discovery of a quarry full of trapped walkers makes the necessity of Rick's group in Alexandria evident to everyone, and the town's sheltered residents must now go into training mode to learn how to fend them off. This allows for several new dynamics to emerge. Rick's people must now become teachers, and that process allows for some amends to be made, and the opportunity for some Alexandrians to redeem themselves. However, it creates tension elsewhere as Rick realizes the chance to thin the town's herd a bit and weed out a few of the weaker residents who could pose a threat. Also, Morgan finally becomes a regular after popping up sporadically over the first five seasons. As expected, he and Rick don't strike an immediately harmonious chord despite their past loyalty to one another. Rick has become far more cold, while Morgan appears to have somehow found a greater sense of humanity. Season 6 has many avenues to explore as Alexandria attempts to fortify itself, Rick and Morgan look to resolve their differences, the Wolves draw nearer, and someone inside the town appears to have gone traitor (my bet is on that massive douche Gabriel). With the show's creative potential as promising as ever, The Walking Dead should not lose any of its momentum during this season.

(The Gabriel comment referred to my belief that he set off the horn at the end of Episode 1. I was wrong, which in no way reduces the massiveness of Gabriel's douchery.)",1445040000,3,1713,4.787162162162162

Won't see that Rick again. There is some risk of over-playing the super vigilant version of Rick and reducing him to a one dimensional character.

7142899,5,B00WNBABVC,"Picking up where season 5 left off, while taking on on new plots, TWD looks very much at the top of its game, with a strong character mix and with massive set piece in the long premiere made possible, by its enormous popularity. Blessed and cursed with a motley crew, the first episode finds the gang still trying to fit into a gated community, where the promise of security is balanced against the separating the hardened travelers from those sheltered within. Add and old friend face to the mix, and its a awesome feast. I do love the black and white through backs. If I could go 6 stars I would!!",1444867200,3,599,4.405405405405405

7142903,4,B00WNBABVC,"Great start, though why they chose the whole B/W backstory piece was a bit questionable in the writing. It is good to see large hordes of walkers though seen so much of this show is about survivor on survivor interactions. They are promising more mayhem in the coming episodes, so I hope they keep the momentum up and show us how hopeless and apocalyptic the end times can be.....someone needs to die and Alexandria needs to really know how bad this sh%t really is.",1444867200,,465,4.5476190476190474

7142906,5,B00WNBABVC,I loved the first episode of Season 6! I disagree with the people who didn't like the black and white flashbacks; I thought they were a great way to make the distinction between the past events and the current situation of the survivors leading the herd out of the canyon.

It was an overused effect that seemed to have no purpose. I sure would have figured out a different way to dispose of the walkers rather than lead them off to kill another day.

7143144,5,B00WNBABVC,"Here we are again, at the start of a brand new season. We all know the emotional turmoil that this season will most likely bring, but at the same time, it's going incredibly entertaining. My only wish is that they don't kill off any of the original cast members. They all feel so essential to the show at this point, that even losing one cast member might throw the show off. In a way, I guess that's what makes this show so great. The fear that any character (except Rick obviously) could die will always keep you in suspense.

I love the usage of flashbacks in this first episode. They blended the past and present so well together -- it was a really great way of story-telling. It's very clear at this point who the top dog is. Rick is trying very hard to make this his final home. He's got so much faith in this new community and he's going to protect it no matter what, even if he has to knock a few heads together.

The introduction of the Morgan, the staff wielding weapons expert that we know and love from the very first season is a very good addition to the team. He brings a calm, collective, and reasonable side and will definitely be a crucial part of the team. I think at this point, he might be the only person who can make Rick see who he's become.",1444780800,3,1264,4.2190082644628095

It knocked me right out of the fantasy to have six or so zombies come running toward the cameras in an effort to catch ""Ron"", son of the woman with whom Rick is in lust, or love. I've been reading some of the reviews that gave one, two, or three stars, and I do  have to admit at times it seemed sloppy....like Rick's timing when he asked Morgan when Morgan had learned martial arts; Morgan did not have time to formulate a response before Rick jumped in and was confrontational about Morgan not having answered him.

7143174,5,B00WNBABVC,"Best show on TV in ages!  Hands down. Have been in it since the beginning.  Am here on Amazon to purchase Season 6 because we don't get cable anymore. (No loss, except for missing TWD.)  I am very excited to see what challenges the group faces this time around.  I agree with someone else's comments that Rick has decided that any threat must be neutralized if they are all to survive.  That Alexandria crowd is not equipped to do the heavy lifting it takes to survive in the time of zombies, although some appear to be stepping up in the first episode.  They need Rick and I think Morgan will be his right-hand man, unless the plan is for them to have Morgan and Rick work against one another (I hope not).
Any one know if you can get TWD theme song as your ring tone on your phone? I'm not kidding!

7143237,5,B00WNBABVC,"""Oh, it's just about zombies.""  Saying that about TWD is like saying Peter Jackson's LOTR is just a remake.
The synergy of trust/team building and group intra-relationships under extreme stress alone is enough to make one watch TWD.  Combine that with excellent acting, storyline, set decoration, extras and excellent+ makeup make TWD a thought provoking drama/""shoot 'em up"" show that is addicting to watch.  Character development through historical flashbacks and  environmental requirements for survival has been top notch+ throughout the life of the show.  Glenn, Carol and Darryl are prime examples of this but there has been growth of all the protagonists through the series.

If you have never watched, start with episode 1, season 1.  You'll see the individual and group dynamics change.  The use of B&W footage for flashbacks in this episode is brilliant and the morphing of Alexandria's woefully unaware residents into Rick's group dynamics is great.

7143241,5,B00WNBABVC,"TWD Season 6 Episode 1 Review: No Spoilers
The pacing on this one was just....incredible. It never moved too slow or went too fast for the viewer. Everything just ""clicked"" exactly right. The character development also moved along just as it should--a hint here and there, a mere facial expression or one sentence and it opened whole new possibilities for Characters their relationships and future development. Understated Perfection. There were surprises this episode, but Not the ones you expected. That's right, I said it. The acting was impeccable by all parties, but this time I was really impressed with the supporting cast, especially the major and the main ""enemy"" of this show--just from his facial expressions alone, you Knew Him. Moving from black and white to color was PERFECT! In fact, the Flashbacks were the best I've ever seen in Any television show or movie. They moved together just right, like a deck of cards being shuffled so smoothly by a master dealer, the sound is like a whisper of music. They never felt jarring or silly but dealt out past and present as a gasp inducing royal Flush.
The Direction, the editing, the zombies make-up, costumes, sheer size of the cast, huge kudos to whomever was managing THAT behind the scenes.....
Everything in This Episode just went exactly as it should. I think when they reviewed it before airing it, people should have stood up and given everyone involved a standing ovation and cried in joy.
The ending...gut wrenching suspense! Excellently done!
6 Stars (an extra star for the flashbacks alone!)
If I had to say it and I will...this was the Best episode of any television show I've ever seen

There is your search image.)  Also, could we have more variation in the walkers' ages? More racial diversity?

7143252,5,B00WNBABVC,"alot of people kept saying how good this show is, but i thought zombies?........no thanks! Thank God i was bored one day and watched an episode with my son! I watched all 5 seasons in less than 2 weeks. I am so excited for this season!",1444521600,14,235,4.130434782608695
7143253,5,B00WNBABVC,"UPDATE:  I think I REALLY wish that Rick had killed every male member of that blonde's family, talk about useless mental midgets that are going to get somebody else killed.  While I am at it, if we have 1 more ""do-gooder"" episode of ""all life is precious""  I am going to perform Seppuku using a damn can-opener.

You can always tell people that have never really watched this program since they always think it is all about zombies.

You can try to explain to them all day long that this is one of the best dramas that television has ever produced that just happens to have zombies in it and they would just look at you like you had lost your mind.

I cannot wait to see what this season brings, it became apparent last season that Rick has finally realized that nothing short of being ready to end ANY threat to the survivors survival has to be dealt with immediately and permanently.  Too bad it took some of the characters longer to figure that out.

I expect to see more of this quality in Season 6 and hope we don't lose anymore of the main cast for awhile, these people become part of why you watch the show but those deaths impress upon us that this is also a show of survival and any lapses in that are usually very temporary.

So let's get started, Rick has definitely established himself as the alpha male for this new group and maybe our heroes and heroines can get a break this season and just learn to deal with each other but then again ........ where is the fun in that .

I think we need to recap some Season 5 last episodes a bit:

A guy is such a coward and so plain evil he gets one of your friends killed, then he ambushes you in the woods trying to kill you or get you fed to the walkers, your response is:

A -  Kick his butt and then put a bullet in his brain to end any future threat.
B -  Win the fight and then tie him to a tree and listen to the walkers have lunch as you walk back to safety.
C -  Win the fight, tend his wounds a bit (that you just gave him while trying to save your life), then while beaten and wounded, you carry him on your back to safety.

OK, Answer time.

If you picked A, you are a practical and logical human with strong survival skills
If you picked B, your fighting skills are only exceeded by your overall badassery
If you picked C, you are Glenn and your TSTL card (Too Stupid To Live) is in the mail and we wonder if you are going to be on the menu for some walker in the near future.

I am SO naive, watching the first episode of the season, I told the wife ""Only 2 minutes left, nothing really earth shattering can happen now"" - I have no idea why I bother to say such stupid things :)

OK, a few seasons ago I really hoped that Carol would bite the dust ..... last couple of seasons she has become a major force and the one person you can count on to do what HAS to be done, the ""I can't kill"" voices are getting people killed and will have to be dealt with sooner or later.",1444521600,202,2935,4.055459272097054

7143256,5,B00WNBABVC,"I just bought season 5 on Blue Ray. Unfortunately the last disk was defective and would not play. Fortunately, I bought from Amazon. They are sending me a replacement with a two day delivery guarantee. Amazon has always gone out of their way to make things right for me. This latest incident just solidifies my continued dealings with this company.
This is one of my favorite seasons. Season 6 cannot air fast enough for me. This whole series has been wonderful. It is thought-provoking and brilliant. The exploration of morality in a world gone mad is quite engrossing. I love the characters and I love the story. Season 5 has delivered.
I would say that if you hate character development and story this will not be for you. This is not some no plot zombie kill fest. This is a moral drama set in a post-apocalyptic society.  It has its brutality but it also allows for reflection on the human condition. This is a zombie story for people who do read.",1444521600,,952,4.567251461988304

7143263,5,B00WNBABVC,"The series is heavily reviewed and I don't know that I have much to add.  The show is well cast in that the more time you spend with the characters the more you care about them and their well being. When something happens to them it feels as if you have lost a close friend. The creepiest thing about the show is that you really can't decided if the ""walkers"" or if other people are the biggest threat.  It really reduces human nature to it's rawest form- survival in the most dire of circumstances.

I will add that season 5 was my favorite, but opinions will vary greatly on that.  I don't want to give away any events in the plot, but if you are a fan of the series you will love the season.",1444348800,,694,4.118518518518519

7143274,5,B00WNBABVC,"OK folks, yes it's zombies, but it is NOT about zombies. Yes, I said it, ZOMBIES, because that is what most of the non-waking public of non-zombie watchers calls them. The show is about the people surviving in a world that has been turned on its ear. How do you start the world all over again? It is a form of caveman days revisited with cars that run on scrounged gasoline, and your food from old canned goods or a lucky-find fruit tree. Your mind is constantly thinking of how to solve their problems for them. Much of the day to day minutiae is not really covered or the show would cover nothing but where they found a meal for a day. As you wind your way through all the seasons of the Walking Dead the battle for survival on a 24 hour basis runs the gamut of finding shelter, finding food, fighting walkers, fighting other survivors, finding a cure, finding other civilized survivors, finding survivors that aren't lying about being civilized, and basically trying find some kind of a normal life among the chaos.

The Walking Dead is the number one show for a reason, it delivers on every level of entertainment. There are no scenes of happy people purchasing new cars and going on luxury hotel excursions. Not sleeping on the ground is a triumph for the cast of the Dead. It is bloody and gory at times, and touching and gripping maybe minutes later. The cast is made up of veritable no-names who are now famous worldwide.  Watch it to follow the people and their desperate existence, and not for the reanimated DEAD. The DEAD are merely obstacles in a rocky road of survival that features far more nasty pitfalls than the lumbering masses.

Start at Season one, no cheating. Season one is amazing, and builds to become more shocking by the 5th.",1444348800,,1752,4.537974683544304

7143358,5,B00WNBABVC,"The two halves of The Walking Dead's fifth season are quite distinct from one another as AMC makes effective use of the two-part season strategy. The first half is pure brutality, with Rick's group facing off in back-to-back wars against Terminus and the Atlanta Hospital. First, they have to fight their way out of Terminus like rats in a trap, teaching the renegades running the place that they were indeed f'ing with the wrong people. Then, after a harrowing escape, they go against the hospital and the Atlanta police. Unfortunately, they don't make it out of this showdown unscathed, setting up their reunion and leaving them to pick up the pieces. Back on the road, the second half of the season hits just as hard, with more shocking character deaths keeping the audience constantly on its toes. The group eventually makes it to another supposed safe haven, the town of Alexandria. The loss of humanity they've experienced after years of survival is never more apparent than when it's contrasted with the relative civilization of Alexandria. They each struggle individually to adapt, with Carol proving to be the most effective, cold, and calculating survivalist in the group. As they find their places within the town, it's quite the sight to behold Rick as an active police officer again, something I never thought would be possible after seeing the complete breakdown of society in the first four seasons. But it's still not enough to bring Rick back to his former self, as the season ends with him advocating public executions in the town. As long-lost Morgan finds his way to Alexandria at season's end, we're left to wonder how it will all play out in Season 6. Like most of the country, I can't wait to see The Walking Dead return for more apocalyptic insanity.",1443571200,,1774,4.858085808580858
7143359,4,B00WNBABVC,"I thought season 4 dragged and wasn't the best but this season gets things back on track.

I would have given it 5 stars but one thing kept bugging me. It's obvious there are some hair and make up stylists in the group with an unlimited supply of shaving cream, razors, brushes and make up. I realize these are all Actors but besides Ricks full beard, everyone looks kinda stylish at times for killing zombies and roughing it in hell. Even the cannibal guys that lost their fortress, looked like they just came from a frat party. Even though Daryl's hair has gotten longer, it's kinda stylish long and he never has much facial hair.

Excellent season and the best zombie killing yet but everyone has that Actor look? Even the Faux Scientist Mullet is styled. Anyone that has gone camping and hiking for 3-4 days roughing it in the woods knows what I mean.",1443571200,,855,4.509677419354839

But as far as entertainment goes, it is very well written.

7143385,5,B00WNBABVC,"This show gets better and better. It has all the gore and violence a good horror/zombie show should have and then some. But it also shows the human side of things. Very often I ask my self would people really do what they do in this show to survive? Could I do these things to survive? My husband is not into the gore stuff as much as I am, but he loves TWD because of the human side of this show. There is no other show, that covers the gore so great and never forgets to show the emotions people have to deal with. The actors are wonderful. I cry with them, I laugh with them and I can feel their fear. I hope people don't get scared away and don't watch the show because of the zombies. People can end up in these kind of situations for any number of reasons, realistic reasons. And that is what would be scary.",1443398400,,814,4.062111801242236

7143461,5,B00WNBABVC,"Walking Dead is the BEST Television show on air. The minute you start watching this AMC Series you become hooked. I became bonded to the characters so deeply. It is very easy to become attached to this series because the characters are flawed people but so deep and it makes them easy to identify with and even more easy to love them. The series is never boring and keeps you guess and waiting for more. I have one complaint however. The choice of characters that get killed off are not in the best interest of the show, an example is Hershel. Killing off Hershel was a bad move and I still miss his character and think many times what he would have brought to the show if he still was alive. I am not liking this NEGAN character and it is way to long to make the fans wait to see who gets killed off again. I still will be watching when it finally airs.

7143523,5,B00WNBABVC,"Its the WALKING DEAD Mannnn!  You would think that says it all.. BUT nope!  The the scope of the interactions with the ""family"" of our dearly loved regulars is astounding.  This truly shows the epic struggle of man vs everyone and everything as our group moves into each trial set before them.  I have now watched ep 1 and 2 of season 6.  OMG.. yes i said it.. and I mean it.  I have watched this series from the pilot.. and I re watch it from pilot to the end of the last aired season before the new season starts.. SO i have watched TWD more than a few times..
I get irritated when i hear the ""I hate Zombies"" stuff.. if you haven't watched it, you are really clueless as to what TRUE television is about.  Good verses Evil?.. No.  Survival.. What is a normal person willing to do to survive an inescapable catastrophe..  The disarming of ones inner moral fiber, to degenerate to pure animalistic behavior...  to hold on to the life values you had.. Mentally, where do you go to survive?
There is way more to this than not dying.  At least more than physical death.  The loss of emotion,  feeling or caring... You can die inside without ever being bit.  All in all.. this is a survival drama with some zombies added in.. Icing on the cake.",1442275200,10,1241,4.316017316017316

7143627,5,B00WNBABVC,"Anyone not watching this show, where and who are you??? This is the second highest rated cable sat tv drama of all time!! Amc is by far the leader of the pack when it comes to awesome,new groundbreaking television. They have now aired two of my favorite shows of all time, The walking dead and breaking bad. TO which each series has its own prequel spinoff series. Fear of the walking dead and Better call saul. I've just watched the first two episodes of fear of the walking dead when they premiered and was just as blown away with it as The walking dead. Getting back to the original, I personally got two of my family members hooked on the walking dead now!! My mother is an avid fan and shes 65 this november,goes to show you this show is truly not just a zombie shootem up. You get attached to the characters after watching this show. The writing, score,visual effects everything just draws you in. If you haven't watched thru season four,then spoiler alert!!!! I was SOOOOO glad to see the govenor get killed, after he killed herschel I wanted to jump in the screen and kill him myself! lol. I really don't get into comics, so I was just introduced through the tv series. Ive already spent a small fortune on two of the four limited edition b-ray sets and tons of action figures. Each season gets more intense, I count the days til the season 6 premiere oct. 11. Theres an average of at least 11 to 16 million people alone who watch it on amc and dvr it, I know theres millions more of fans who like to watch on amazon and other outlets. This show is a unstoppable train thats gunna keep on rolling! I hope the spin off series is around for a good while too. With the team of writers,producers,directors,actors and the best special effects team in the biz GREG NICOTERO and his team this show is beyond amazing, This is the show i've been waiting for since I was young. If you haven't seen this show you're either without tv or technology. Do yourself a favor and dive into the greatest zombie/human drama ever made!!!!",1441411200,,2025,4.431635388739946

7143659,5,B00WNBABVC,"This is the most incredible show to hit the air waves in a very long, long time.  I believed that it was going to be some silly zombie show that I would never watch, because I'm not big on zombie movies.  My friend told me to watch, I really didn't want to, but man was I wrong!!!  Not only did I get hooked, I wanted the entire show, season after season, in about a week.  I watched the first four seasons on Netlfix and when I realized they didn't have season 5, I immediately purchased it.  The only problem is that I can't get season 6 fast enough (because it isn't out yet!)  I highly highly recommend this show, it has complicated relationships, ethical ad moral situations, romance, so many varied personalities and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It made me fall in love with characters and made me hate them and that is absolutely the sign of a good program and incredible acting.  A++++++",1441152000,,903,4.333333333333333

Season 4 's limited edition was over produced and not very limited and you could buy it for $60. The only reason I pre-ordered this limited edition was it was an Amazon exclusive, which I don't see on the listing anymore!

7143771,5,B00WNBABVC,"Late to the game Walking Dead junkies here.  My wife and I had been talking about starting a new series.  We hate to start a new one until it is up and running because sure enough, a few episodes in and it seems they get dropped leaving you wondering who killed Laura Palmer.  Well with five seasons we felt that if we liked it we had a good six months of entertainment ahead of us... that was three weeks ago.

We have Netflix and Seasons 1-4 are all free on Netflix so I assumed we were good.  But about 18 days and four seasons later (no lie) my wife demanded, I won't say she would shiv me in the brain if I didn't, but she certainly forcefully demanded that I immediately order the next season.  I did, and four days later it was consumed.  I am assuming if you are looking at Season 5 you already know what to expect.  But for me, for us, what to expect and the Walking Dead are two different things.  Every other promising show (Lost for example) may have a great first or second season but after that we just sit and wait for the end of season cliff hanger, will the one character survive.  No spoiler here... you just never know.  People are people and when you think you know the way they are they are living in a zombie apocalypse so they just might wind up a little different than you think.  Otherwise normal people may be pushed past a limit and otherwise passive people may step up.  In other words, if you missed Season 5 and are awaiting Season Six do not hesitate, pull the trigger (or the bow string), for the price of a couple of IMAX tickets you get an entire season.

7143789,4,B00WNBABVC,"The Walking Dead: The Complete Fifth Season begins with the outstanding episode, No Sanctuary, one of the most action-packed, bloodiest of the series. Season 4 concluded with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and the group outnumbered, outgunned, and trapped in a shipping container at the mercy of Gareth and his band of cannibals. The outlook was bleak.

Apart from season opening and finale episodes, the shows too often lapse into long, talky sequences that slow the pace and kill suspense. The show is about humans defending themselves from becoming zombie meals, but we have back stories, conflicts, and assorted treks to supposedly safe locations.

Special effects are the best on television, easily ranking with what you can see in Hollywood features. The producers keep coming up with new and ghastly images, and I suppose thats what keeps viewers coming back. Its tough sustaining any series for more than three seasons, especially one whose goal is shocking viewers. Even deaths of key characters have become predictable, occurring for the most part in season finales. Still, despite these shortcomings, The Walking Dead is a gruesomely effective horror series.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include several behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentaries, and deleted scenes.",1440374400,,1284,5.442211055276382

7143811,5,B00WNBABVC,"*I received a review copy of this set in exchange for an honest review

I simply cannot say enough good things about THE WALKING DEAD.  I have had the privilege to review each season as it has been released on DVD/Blu-ray, and each time I laud the show for what it is and what it represents.  But my reviews do not do the show justice.  It is that good.  I am in my forties, and I cannot think of another show in all my years of TV watching that has been this impressive.  Season 5 continues this tradition of excellence, and I am extremely proud to state it is my favorite season thus far.

I think Ive said this before, but one of the most impressive aspects about this show is how NO character is safe.  The writers have no qualms about killing anyone off, regardless of how major or minor their role in the storyline is.  Just knowing that your favorite character could die during any episode ratchets the tension up exponentially.

As with each previous season, THE WALKING DEAD is shot well and looks like a movie.  The production value is way high, which allows for deeper immersion into each episode.  I daresay this is the best looking show on television.

The acting is again superb, with Andrew Lincoln headlining an amazing cast.  The regulars (who have survived previous seasons) are once again present as well, including Norman Reedus as Daryl, Steven Yeun as Glenn, Lauren Cohan as Maggie, Chandler Riggs as Carl, Danai Gurira as Michonne, and Melissa McBride as Carol.  Newcomers to this season include Seth Gilliam, who portrays the downtrodden priest, Gabriel; Josh McDermitt, who plays scientist Dr. Eugene Porter; and Christian Serratos, who shines as Rosita Espinosa, Abrahams girlfriend, just name a few.

The special effects in season 5 of THE WALKING DEAD are once again stupendous.  They rival even the best movies that are being made today.  I particularly like how the zombies appear more and more decomposed as the show progresses.  This is a testament to the respect the production team gives the audience; they know we (as a whole) will expect rot to ensue as time passes.

THE WALKING DEAD season 5 is another huge win for me, and I recommend it whole-heartedly.  If you have never watched the show, do yourself a favor and give it a look.  If you're up-to-date on the television episodes, snatch this season 5 set up immediately to add to your collection.  The Blu-ray version has an excellent HD picture and sound, and some nice Special Features as well, including:

* Featurettes, such as Inside the Walking Dead; The Making of The Walking Dead; The Making of Alexandria; Beths Journey; Bobs Journey, etc.
* Audio Commentaries
* Deleted Scenes

7143827,4,B00WNBABVC,"As I admitted when I reviewed the first four seasons of THE WALKING DEAD, with certain exceptions, I am not a fan of horror movies or television series.

I am even less a fan of the zombie movie.  Frankly, I think they are silly.

On the other hand, I love a well-written, intelligent scripteven if it is in the horror genre.  Good writing is good writing, no matter where you find it.

THE WALKING DEAD may have been adapted from a series of graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, and there are plenty of zombies walking around and feasting in the sixteen-episode fifth season, but these decaying creatures continue to take a back seat to the compelling human dramas that are played out between the survivors.

Because we, as an audience, come to care about these multi-dimensional characters, many who do not survive the season, when the zombies (aka: walkers) do attack they are anything but silly.  They are truly frightening.

Again, viewers who enjoy blood, guts and gore will not be disappointed, but unlike most zombie movies, thats not what this series is about.  In THE WALKING DEAD, story and character trump visceral delights.

As with my previous reviews, I am not going to give specific plot details, except to say that this season begins with the survivors escaping their railroad car captivity at Terminus, and then destroying the refuge.  As the season progresses, Andrew Lincolns character becomes much darker, and there are suspenseful story arcs set in a remote country church, a hospital in Atlanta and, finally, a fortified community in Alexandria, VA.

All of the performances in the show continue to be superb, as are the Georgia-filmed series visual effects, make-up and other elements.  Tovah Feldshuh, Christine Woods and Seth Gilliam appear this season in roles that makes one wonder who their characters really are, and Lennie James also returns.  This is, indeed, a first-rate production.

My chief concern, once again, about the programs future is: How long can the creators successfully continue the basic premise without resolving it?  Although Season Five ends with a powerful climax, it does, at times seem repetitive.  Indeed, how many ways are there to kill a zombie?

Hopefully, the producers will not allow this excellent series to overstay its welcome.

The five-disc Blu-ray from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a full disc of extras, audio commentaries for many episodes, Behind the Scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes.  My one mayor complaint about the set is that there are no recaps at the start of each episode, which often makes it difficult to recall who certain character are if you haven't seen them for several episodes or, as in the case of Lennie James since Season 3.

But after a friend continuously bugged me about giving this show a chance, I finally broke down and watched an episode last year.  I quickly became obsessed and binge-watched Seasons 1-4 right before Season 5 started back up on AMC.
Yes, it's gory.  Yes, it's suspenseful.  It tears my nerves to shreds.  But this show draws you in and gets you so attached to the characters you have to keep watching to find out what happens to them. Many times it is devastating and heartbreaking.  There aren't many shows that make me cry. But this one has on quite a few occasions.

While I love all of my limited editions, I never had to wait months after the initial release date to purchase them. All previous limited editions released simultaneously to their non limited counterparts. While from a marketing standpoint this is genius, as a consumer, it sucks. You either buy both so you can, ""have your cake and eat it to"" so to speak, or you wait and buy yourself an early Christmas gift. I've already pre-ordered, even ordered prior to knowing the December release date, thinking I'd have my copy on the 25th of August. It does suck, but  I'll wait since I have all the others.

7143935,5,B00WNBABVC,"""If you've never watched the show, do yourself a favor and start from the very beginning to catch up.""
This is great advice!

I had never watched the show before, but became hooked on it when I happened to start watching during Season 5 just as the ""Alexandria"" story arc began. I knew immediately that this was a series worth investing in, so I ordered seasons 1-5 on blu-ray disk, and burned through seasons 1-4 in four days (my pre-ordered Season 5 blu-ray disks should arrive around the Labor Day weekend)!

My viewing experience -- on disks -- has been superb. Honestly, buying shows and seasons to stream/watch, or waste valuable disk space on my TIVO, doesn't appeal to me at all. Too bad the Amazon ratings are skewed with negatives from the ""online"" viewing model, as opposed to the content and quality of the show itself :(

In any event, having gone back and watched everything right from Episode 1 is very rewarding, good advice and I'm glad I did it.
FYI, watching from disks, with the continuity of moving seamlessly from one episode to the next, creates a great ""mood"" and adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the experience. The series almost plays like a good movie that just keeps going. And, this is a very good thing :)",1439251200,,1240,4.601809954751131

And the thing is, the show is getting even better as it goes. In my opinion the 5th season is right up there with the 3rd, which was my favorite previously. But season 5 was no doubt more consistently good throughout the season and was better spread out than the 3rd. Andrew Lincoln has grown to be one of my favorite actors and his performance in season 5 is no doubt his best work yet as Rick Grimes. Norman Reedus, as Daryl Dixon, is a great contributor to the show and adds extra element that the show needs. There are many story lines in season 5 headlined by the Hunters and Alexandria. This is a must watch. Not just for zombie fans but also for people who want to be entertained by a great story, great action sequences, great acting, drama, and much more!",1439078400,,934,4.2824858757062145

Sure, the action slows down and it is more a narrative, but just like a good book, it pulls an emotional cord. No spoilers, aside from ""look at the flowers"".

7143981,2,B00WNBABVC,"The most recent season of the WD really fell flat for me. For all of the strong ratings and successes I would imagine the budget for the show has increased since previous seasons. However this season felt like the budget took a step backwards, and the directing wasn't on par with previous seasons. Of course the drama shifted mightily, and I understand why, but at the core of the show's success for me has always been an unflappable faith in Rick, and rooting for him to survive and protect those around him. Once you start posing questions at the heart of Rick, you jeopardize the formula for success with this show.  And as a friend of mine says ""angry Rick is the best Rick.""
I will stay with the WD until it's final episode whenever that is, so this season is necessary in totality. However, I'm hoping for an uptick in the season to come next.",1438992000,,850,4.448717948717949

Unlike the sheep on here wasting time complaining about prices, I won't rate something that isn't released to the masses solely based on a ""suggestive price"" but will rate it on how wonderful the season is compared to the ones before it. The show just keeps outdoing itself with every season.

Do yourself a favor, ignore the belly aching over the pricing and focus on what's important the actual season and the hand painted piece that comes with the discs. Getting bent out of shape over something that doesn't even have a release date is just plain stupid. Grow up. If you don't buy it, do you honestly think Amazon will lose sleep? They know there is market for this regardless of price. They could charge $150 or $500 and there will always be someone that'll fork over the money. It's business. The Walking Dead is a GIANT goldmine. Suck it up and deal with it. Wait and don't purchase it and see what happens with the price when it's out. I want it but I won't pay THAT much for it. I'll take my chances. It's a gamble and I'm holding off before I let it ride. But I will say this much, I won't rate something by giving it a bad review simply because I disagree with the price. That just makes you look sad, LOL.",1438646400,7,1464,4.32
7144041,1,B00WNBABVC,"LOL @ this ridiculous price point, what makes this box set different from the other previous Walking Dead sets? Other then Amazon seemingly taking advantage of their customers because unfortunately this is an Amazon EXCLUSIVE.

No other retailers will be selling these, of which I spoke to a rep for MovieStop who I have always gone to for The Walking Dead Pre-Orders and they are highly upset that this year they will not be selling them.

If I am going to shop with Amazon, It's because of the great deals, but this....is far from a deal. It's a BAD deal, which needs to be adjusted.

LOWER YOUR PRICE AMAZON! I'll just add to the growing list of NON BUYERS for this product. At this price, I can live without it!

Some episodes to drive the story forward, some to explore our characters in depth, some episodes shot more artistically, and some more viscerally. I love that women and people of color are treated like important, fully conceived characters on this show. I love that 3 women can share a combat scene together without being treated like girls in distress. I love how this season explored the psychology and morality our favorite characters and the individuals populating the apocalypse remains of America.

The gore and death porn can go a little too far but, what can I say that others have not said elsewhere better than I? I'm just continually impressed. With the maturity with which the show is handled, the story moves forward, and how the characters grow and change. Bravo.

7144167,5,B00WNBABVC,"Felt I should leave a review myself as there are so many negative one-star reviews all despairing over the high ""initial"" price point of this set. I feel like it's the same batch of people who do this every year; not realizing the prices drop before a show releases every single time. So please, do not let the high price scare you. If if does not drop before release, cancel your order and wait for the eventual sale. The show-makers cannot steal someone's money if it's voluntarily given. No one is being forced to buy anything.

Pre-ordered this set as soon as it became available. My current review is based on the quality of the season as seen of TV. I will update later when I get the actual product in the mail on release day. For what it's worth, I feel like this season is the best one since season two. It had tremendous acting all around and the plot was very engaging. I get a feeling that next season will be the best yet. As always, the plot is somewhat divided into two parts because of the break between November and February, but I'd rather get more bang for my buck as compared to the offerings of shows with fewer episodes than what is wanted or warranted (I'm looking at you Game of Thrones).

Also as normal is the higher quality of episodes at those certain spots in the season. For people like me who enjoy the slower, character building episodes however this is not an issue. It's almost guaranteed that if you've watched and enjoyed the prior seasons, you will enjoy this one. Don't hesitate to buy unless you're waiting for Black Friday like prices. You won't regret purchasing this season.",1437436800,4,1616,4.493197278911564

7144415,5,B00WNBABVC,"EDIT July 18th - So people are giving this a a low rating because of the price? That's really pathetic!! You do realize that more than likely the price will go down. Amazon put a price on it so that people could actually pre order it. I wouldn't be surprised if the price dropped at or below 100 bucks. But a low rating due to price shows how sad people are. I pre ordered it when it was 149.99. If you are a real fan of the show then the price will not be outrageous. Let me remind folks that this is HAND PAINTED. They need to make money too, Stop being cheap!!!!
---------------------------------------

Ok,  so I'm rating an item that isn't even on  the radar yet. Sort of silly. If the other limited edition sets are any indication of what might be, then McFarlane should knock this out of the park.

I have all four of the limited sets and my favorite is without a doubt season 2. The zombie head with the screw driver through the eye that lifts to reveal the Blu-ray box set.

I also liked the severed heads in water tanks and the tree walker.

I seriously hope that there is a season 5 limited edition.

I will edit this review if this product becomes available and I purchase it.",1436227200,5,1188,4.253333333333333

I ended up watching all of the past seasons within 1 week!! This series is so interesting and not at all what I expected. The show follows a group of people the main charecters and develops a strong story line about the trials and tribulations of the group. It's hard to guess what will happen next because the writers of the show keep you on your feet with twists and turns never Imagined.,1435881600,,542,4.221153846153846

I was sorry to see some characters leave and others didn't bother me as much. I've watched every season, all more than once, and I still think it's one of the best on TV, next to Game of Thrones.",1435622400,,369,3.7435897435897436

7144465,5,B00WNBABVC,"The fifth season of the walking dead has reinvigorated my love of this show. Season four had some really weak moments on the long road to Terminus and I believe the writers really stepped up their game for this one. There is a true sense of dread, loneliness, savagery and humanity painted this season.

There is a noticeable change in cinematography for the better, things feel grittier whilst at the same time real (truer) and brilliant - the last few episodes have some scenes that almost feel artsy like they were trying out some new things.

I'd highly recommend buying the whole season so you can sit back and have a good weekend of it.",1435536000,,642,4.573913043478261

Comic-Book Men, Hell on Wheels - if it's on AMC, it's on sale in the booklet with the bluray. Now, the season itself was between 3-4 stars (unless you're in love with Super Daryl then ignore.
The extras was the only thing that made me buy this, and on sale at $25, that's a good deal, half off! But it's not enough, not when in a month it's on Netflix, or could DVR the episodes every time AMC repeats them.
You're also given a digital code so you can have a digital copy to watch on Flixster or Vudu - but only the episodes, not the extra content. So honestly, not a great buy, if it's on sale, hey go for it, if not, 44 dollars for a show you can get from Netflix or another provider for a cheap monthly fee is the way to go.",1435363200,,877,4.104651162790698

I'm not into zombie TV/movies so I had absolutely no interest in watching this even when everyone else was raving about it. Well I finally gave in and decided to try the first episode. For about the following 2 weeks I turned into a zombie glued to the TV watching seasons 1-5. I couldn't stop! Now I can't wait for the next season!

7144759,1,B00WNBABVC,"Five seasons in and these idiots still can't clear a house. Let's all talk about our feelings in the middle of a fire fight. Zombies are attracted to noise so let's find the loudest most unreliable piece of s*** bike and ride it up and down and up and down and up and down the road announcing to God, baby Jesus and every zombie in a ten mile radius our exact location. Rick, a local law enforcement officer is completely ignorant as to the topology of his own county. None of them have any clue that there are fruit and nut trees everywhere. Not a Kevlar vest to be found. Automatic weapons???? No way, let's use a sword. I can top that with my crossbow. Let's top it by stabbing the zombies in the head with pocket knives. Let's go wonder through the woods unarmed because it's perfectly safe, that's where all the teens go to make out because there's not one room in the whole gated community where you can get a little privacy. Let's all make lots and lots and lots of noise every single scene all the time day and night no matter what the danger because we have to express how we are FEELING!!!. AR?,AK? Nah....I'm gonna use this here hammer. If they all fell off the short bus on the way the Chuck E Cheese in the very beginning, I would not only understand, but also sympathize and maybe even enjoy watching this band of merry glue sniffers as they lay starving in peach orchards as herds of zombies endlessly zero in on the noise from that oil leaking couch that Darryl rides. Not a Honda or Kawasaki to be found in the lower 48, no sir. How about a couple of nice quiet bicycles????? How dare you!?!?! You know what else they don't have in the south??? Fish!!!! No one fish or fishing rod or harpoon or lake or stream.... Nothing!! So let's recap..there are NO automatic weapons, fruit trees, nut trees, lakes, streams, ponds, fish, fishing rods, Kevlar vests, Honda motorcycles, maps, farms, wild game, bicycles, boats, riot gear, bullets, rope, pad locks, binoculars, compasses, or even pencils and paper for making notes on how to avoid zombies in the great state of Georgia.....yes that make perfect sense.

I watched the entire series in a week and I'm anxious for season 6. The character development is incredible. I've become addicted to this because of the realistic storyline and the characters. My heart breaks every time they lose someone, I feel like I'm losing someone I know. If you haven't watched it, do it now!

7144884,5,B00WNBABVC,"Season Five begins with one of the most exciting and triumphant episodes they've ever aired (No Sanctuary). It's my favorite in the entire series. Though I believe most people would agree about that rock 'em sock 'em episode, there's a lot of divergence in opinion about the rest of this season. Critics loved it and applauded it's development of the characters and its ability to keep up with a number of separate strands., Others found the middle dragged with too much given over to the trapped situation of a character who had been fairly minor until now. Others were bummed by the down and desperate tone of Episode 10 (Them), though I found that a really truthful portrayal of just how grim a life on the road would be. It can't all be heroics and zombie killings. The second half of the season gradually introduces a whole new scene and many new characters and will obviously pay off next season. As usual there is a powerful season finale. Definitely worth seeing. Accept it for what it is, not just a fantasy of what someone would rather have it be.

WORTH SEEING TWICE. I'm glad I got these from Amazon (as HD streaming) because it allows me to see each episode more than once. I just finished watching the whole series to the end of ssn. 5 and it was well worth it. The first time around you'e so caught up in the plot, the tension, the wondering if a character is going to be killed by the zombies, that you miss a lot. Seeing it all a second time allowed me to pick up on many small details I missed the first time as well as many nuances of the characters. Also, it's much better without blocks of ads if you caught it first on AMC. I really highly recommend owning the whole series.",1432425600,2,1696,4.401273885350318

7144959,4,B00WNBABVC,"Good show and well written, however the early seasons were the best. Some things are far fetched, but obviously the whole zombie concept is more story-land than reality anyhow. Shows/movies of this genre have the potential to either be really low budget bad or pretty Hollywood style decent. This one is pretty decent.  All in all, we have definitely enjoyed it.",1431734400,,362,4.934426229508197

7145001,5,B00WNBABVC,"THis show is soo awesome!  And I know it's like set in the future where zombies are everywhere and not just in underground government labs, but we can all relate to it, too.  Why?  Because it has so much about personal relationships and high stakes and politicking, and like the zombies are always around, and they're coming.  They're this oppressive force, like certain football league's quote-unquote independent investigators hell bent on tainting certain Pats' quarterbacks for something I never did.  It's like, are you the face of the show, like Rick The Sheriff?  Oh, then, because we zombies have nothing going for us we're gonna try to eat you, just like a certain commissioner is trying to do to a certain handsome wink-wink QB.  Season 5 really turns it up a notch from the last four seasons and when I watch it alone in our second guest house when Giselle is in the Canary Islands shooting a photo calendar or whatever and I'm crying I'm also thinking about how this is really unjust and zombies are jerks and should just let handsome Rick The Sheriff be alone some times - he didn't do anything to bring this on and ROger is not invited to the next pool party with Vinny from Entourage.  PS - new Entourage movie looks sick but maybe it's missing one smiling face? :)  PS - I'll be okay.  My law coach is gonna appeal",1431561600,,1330,4.550420168067227

The acting is brilliant, particularly by Andrew Lincoln (Rick) as their leader. The support characters, Maggie, Darrell, Glenn, Carol, Carl, Herschel, and all the rest round out a great cast. The story-line is suspenseful and full of action. I admit the Walking Dead characters are a little gory but compliment the acting. You get used to the head squashing after a while, and it passes without much thought later in the series. Overall, I rate it a five-star series. I have watched the entire five seasons, and I can hardly wait for season six to start in October 2015. B. Warden",1431216000,,714,4.813008130081301

7145067,5,B00WNBABVC,"I had been so turned off by everything Zombie or Vampire.  My son was a dedicated follower of this program and we saw how intensely he was into it.  I wanted to see what could have ever interested him so much with such genre as this, especially since he has such discriminating taste, so my husband and I watched the first 3 shows a year and a half ago.  Well needless to say, we've been dedicated fans too.  Caught up on all the back seasons and now watch the current seasons with my son when he comes over. The actors are phenominal, the story line is so suspenseful that we can barely wait until the next week's show.  The themes of the show bring a powerful interaction of emotions.  Who ever writes these episodes has done so well with it.  We hope it continues.",1431043200,,767,4.284722222222222

7145168,3,B00WNBABVC,Did the writers change for this season?  I don't follow that much but something was missing this season.  At first I thought the season was going to be interesting.  I understand that the group has to settle down somewhere and you can't just do the group fights bad guy all the time.  That is why I started watching this and have watched for 5 seasons.  I loved the character development and the stories between the characters but this season was very lacking in that development.  I understand that Rick could go bonkers and start becoming the bad guy but that just wasn't developed well enough to be believable.  And then all of a sudden he is NOT the bad guy and becomes the hallowed leader again?  Nahhhh....it didn't work.  And Carol's personality has just gone off the rails with no real sense of understanding about that.  I guess there is an assumption that you have been watching all the episodes but that is taking the audience for granted.  Don't take us for granted or we won't come back to watch the next seasons.,1430524800,2,1026,4.551912568306011

Start with Season 1, if you have never seen the show before OR you will not understand the characters, how they have changed, and what they are capable of.

I find it difficult to understand why the characters get bummed out about how things are, because if you think about it, you get to camp every day, take whatever you find, money doesn't mean anything anymore and you get to find new and creative ways to smack the s***e out of some zombie skulls and murder with impunity.

7145402,3,B00WNBABVC,"Walking Dead's Season 5 may, to some, be the best ever.  However, to this viewer it's the beginning of the great shark jump.  The entire season seemed to be a hodge-podge of ideas.  Who's right?  Why is Rick always in charge?  Doesn't it just annoy you the way he always leans in when he's going to talk?  This season may have been produced the way it was because the actors are likely charging more per episode than ever before.  Very few episodes had the core group together and when it did, the episode was mediocre at best.

Yes, I know, this is MY review and probably not the consensus of many.  But Walking Dead is now becoming, well, boring.",1429488000,8,648,4.378151260504202

Brilliantly done and the messages that you get from each episode are deep and moving.  The cast couldn't be better and the way the relationships are built and enhanced with each season is wonderful.  The story line is intelligent and the way it is done is incredible.  When I started watching on Netflix, I watched the entire 4 seasons twice, then went to AMC for the 5th.  I still watch the re-runs every Wednesday.  I cannot wait till the next season.  I watch a lot of great shows on Netflix and tv, this one tops them all.  GREAT JOB to all the actors, producers and directors.  Also, the Talking Dead is really helpful to work through the episode and the losses (brilliant idea)!

7145563,5,B00WNBABVC,"What do I say about The Walking Dead. Well, I will start by saying that I don't watch much television, I am far to busy to get hooked into watching series. I usually watch documentaries, or the occasional H2 or Discovery type series. The last series on television that I really got into was 'Lost' on ABC. Well, The Walking Dead is and has been my one show since season 3, I discovered the pilot episode on netflix and proceeded to immerse myself in the full first two seasons. I have not stopped, it has become an obsession and I find myself looking for ""Safe Zones"" in my daily life. Yes this show is that good, that it carries over. I just can't stop thinking about it for days after each new episode. Amazing stuff, Great writing, Great acting (with the occasional southern accent flub by our British actors). I am always on the edge of my seat and champing at the bit for the next episode. Best show ever!",1428883200,,910,4.358823529411764

But with all that aside, it's still the story about each character that I tune in for. And once again, a new group of people have been introduced, but having the previous seasons in my background, I myself (just like Rick) do not trust them. So I guess the real question is... Can anyone ever be trusted again?",1428710400,,459,4.215909090909091

7145658,4,B00WNBABVC,"The show is still popular but becoming too dramatic with silly emotions that start to make the episodes more and more unreal. Also tends to become predictable in most cases and doesn't seem to be leading to anything substantial yet. As with warehouse 13, The show went to hell and became unpopular and I for one completely stopped watching it when they had to go from good story line to ""Oh yeah, Lets make the season about gays and how they are a part of our every day life"". like everyone is on board with this and look at how great it is...... NOT!!
In this case, they're border line with cramming it down our throats. Since they have not made it too much of an issue it is not run me off yet.
 Stick with the story line and stay away from trying to make us all think this crap is socially accepted and the show will do well. I've worked for decades in the real world in about 6 states in the mid west in very diverse environments and though we all new about the gay communities, none of this was ever brought to light in our world but then again, we live in a real world and TV is make believe. None the less, I don't mind knowing that their are gay people in the movie but don't make the movie about them when your expecting the movie to be about dead people. STICK TO THE STORY. The sick crap will never ever be accepted so stop wasting your time. Live and let live I say but don't try and cram it down my throat or sneak it into my TV show. You'll just loose the people and the ratings WILL go bye bye.",1428537600,,1509,4.08080808080808

My account was charged for one standard definition episode 1 and one high HD episode 1. Should at least get credit for the episode I could Only stand to watch for about three minutes.

This season was particularly interesting because of the RE-visit [via a dying man's ghost-haunting]
of several former [dead] Characters from the show... you never know who is gonna DIE on this show!
Love it, so far, START to...uh... that ""F-word"".... FINISH!

I, absolutely, LOVE this show. I'm, a-l-m-o-s-t , EAGERLY awaiting the ACTUAL Zombie Apocalypse!

In fact, there are so many themes and conflicts going on between the groups of survivors....good versus bad, kill or be killed that in fact, it's safe to say that the survivors themselves are the walking dead. I started watching this series in early March 2015 and have now almost concluded Season 5, and it is just April 4, 2015, as of this writing. The show is so intense and even on a 'slow' episode, the dialogue and character development is mind blowing.  Such a thought provoking series about the demise of civilization, government, and society, but underneath the ties of family, friendship, and love, not to mention our human instinct to survive.",1428105600,,690,4.741666666666666

7145974,5,B00WNBABVC,"What would you do with $27.00 USD for entertainment? Would you go to AMC movies with a date? Would you go on a date for two at a restaurant? No. The right answer is to buy season 5 of the walking dead, which includes 16 full episodes, 10 hours of suspense, drama, and plot twists. $27 USD is the price of two Saturday night AMC movie tickets ($13.50 USD). Why bother going to the movies nowadays and deal with the hassle of waiting in line, crowded movie theaters, parking, lousy service, being at the mercy of others, and watching the same actors and actresses in all Hollywood movies. The Walking Dead represents mainstream USA; it represents us because we are the melting pot. We are the average joe, gay, different colors, straight, or whatever. In the end, we are the same and face the greatest threat of them all: zombies. The Walking Dead S5 is a smart buy.",1428019200,,864,4.474683544303797
7145975,5,B00WNBABVC,"2020 eh, they have enough content for shows till 2020, the year of the end?, well if they keep the interset up, if people don't change fads, if the infinite desires of the viewers stays with this show, then 2020. As for this episode, it is the 'W' of episodes not the end like the letter 'Z'. It is intirely dependant on previous episodes to be as good as it is. So watch at least the four before this one. It has bad news for cavemen, they all died. Then they became us!. Sorry this is not a spoiler is it? I mean did we come from dead cavemen, so the entire show is a return to our dead roots? What Am I Talking about? he he, well a sorta quote from one of the charactes, the cavemen all died and then became us...  This is the only bad line in the whole 65 minutes, and that is why it does not get six stars. I loved the first season, and everyone after that, except maybe the first eight of season four, I imagine all the broken people in the world most of them come to walk as undead zombies, while the rest get to ... perhaps the most important thing is not living, not trying, not being the people we thought we were, but to become in the fullness of God's light what our sins really are.so we can confess to ourselves and find salvation. And if this review does not intrigue, go watch Sesame Street. It is alot deeper than what most see and hear. My final note, make all episodes ninty minutes, more slots for ads.",1428019200,,1422,4.096774193548387

The character development  is amazing and awe inspiring to watch. It's as if the zombies themselves represent the decaying order of man. Righteousness, morals, integrity, faith and hope are instilled in the survivors from the old order of man but are useless or even dangerous  to excercise.

7146029,4,B00WNBABVC,Still enjoying the series a ton but some of the nonlinear plot lines feel choppy and that's annoying. A few characters seem to lack the cautious vigilance that has kept them alive so far- you know- there's been some shouting out loud at the screen when stupid decisions are made- but then I guess that's proof it's still very engaging. Other surviving humans tend to be more dangerous than the un-dead at this point: zombies don't develop unexpected emotional issues and they don't have the ability to learn- at least not yet :-)  It's like I always say- Zombies don't lie.,1428019200,,573,4.673267326732673

7146032,3,B00WNBABVC,"While the last episode maintained the integrity of the characters of the group, several of the preceding episodes felt like the actions of the main characters (primarily Rick) were not quite as believable as previous seasons. A few scenes seemed hastily put together during the last several episodes, but thankfully the ending seemed to tie things together in a way that the future of TWD can still be bright. My hope is that the writing for next season improves somewhat though (as this seems to be a true challenge for series that extend multiple seasons).",1428019200,,558,4.88421052631579

7146155,4,B00WNBABVC,"The season started off great with the first episode at Terminus, and in a slow pace sends the story of the group into a well crafted Season. Overall, I liked this season a lot, but did feel certain episodes caused me to feel disjointed and annoyed....but after you watch the whole season, you feel like you have read a well thought out book. For whatever reason, I think some of the casting is a little off, but probably intentional. I don't think that the Priest or Rick's new love interest was casted well....so I am hoping they both get killed off early next season. Not falling in love with the Alexandria community cast, but adjusting accordingly. If it wasn't for the season finale (plus Morgan coming back) wrapping everything up so well....I would have given this season 2 thumbs down, but kudos to the cast and producers for doing a great job.",1427846400,2,852,4.6118421052631575

7146197,5,B00WNBABVC,"This series builds on numerous current social parellels (helplessness, entitlement, gun control, diversity, capitol punishment, etc.) and often uses symbolism (the samurai sword that represents Michonne's survival strength/instinct, how the once-domesticated horse who lets his defences down when he comes in contact with Daryl but then subsequently fails to run away from the zombies represents the individuals in the group once they experience civilization at Alexandria).  You need to pay attention to catch all the references and keep up on the dialogue.  The graffic scenes are not as bad as one would think, maybe you just get used to them quickly as they are a recurrent thread to the series (you can only kill so many zombies before it becomes common place).

All the characters have now evolved to the point of being utterly deadly and no-one should even think about messing with them.
It makes for great TV and will keep you glued to the screen. I am not good with gore or scariness, but this is the one programme I have to watch. The pace is good, acting superb - especially from Andrew Lincoln, who can 'eye-act' better than anyone. The directors all know by now to just zoom in on his eyes and the audience will know exactly 'what's happening and what's going on'.
This season is relentless: just when you think you can't take any more, they throw something else at you.
In summary, all of these (and more), are the reasons it's the highest rated TV programme ever. Very well done.",1427760000,,768,4.415492957746479

Some episodes are so intense that I've found myself sweating after it's over. Others are so emotional that I actually start crying. The characters go through some pretty unbelievable things, and they themselves evolve into people that you would never expect them to be.

7146257,3,B00WNBABVC,"For me the show is finally starting to rise above being simply OK. An interesting study of humanity when society breaks down.

I find the level of graphic gore too much personally. I'm sure for some that's exactly what attracts them to the show and that worries me a little. I wonder if the current fashion for blood spatter over the lens was toned down, would it make the show less enjoyable? To me it looks gratuitous and  actually distracts from the 'storytelling'.

The desperate struggle to survive has eased and given us more interesting and complex characters as a result. It's taken this long to find a character that I find interesting; Carol has proven to be a complex character that I find to be the most compelling reason to watch the show.

7146267,5,B00WNBABVC,"It is pretty hard to write a review without spoilers, but I'll try. Season five is pretty bleak and everyone is in survival mode. Deaths of beloved characters, of course. It is important to look back at earlier seasons in order to really get the context of this one and the reasons for why the characters are behaving as they are and if they've become stronger or weaker or if they've just descended into a savagery that cannot be reversed. There are the occasional ""moments of grace"", as I call them, when they can laugh or enjoy something amazing. But it always returns to a brutal fight for survival. There are also cowards in this season that put in sharp relief how brave and honorable ""our"" group is, in their way. You will get angry and sad and hopeful and stunned and horrified and really run the gamut of emotions with our people through this season.

We are HughesNet internet folks with the middle tier download allowance (15MB) and find that (usually) we will use less than than one half of a meg or less to watch an episode. The only issue we've had, was when Season 5 first started. I'm thinking everyone was hitting the server that particular evening because we experienced a lot of program buffering and it took over an hour and a half to watch the first episode. Since then every episode we've watched has been buffer free. We're using a Visio HD smart tv connected through Wifi from a Cisco Linksys E2500.

Season 5 continues to show the transformation of all of our beloved characters--and some new ones--and how they cope with surviving what is essentially the end of the modern world as we know it.  This season really drives home the point that the real horror of this new world is less about the ""walkers"" and more about what is left of the human race.  Would HIGHLY recommend AFTER catching up on all the past episodes, this is not a show you pick up in the middle--this is a show in which you need to take the journey with the characters from the very beginning.",1427414400,,636,4.372881355932203

I don't want to include many details to avoid a spoiler, so let's just say that if you've watched Season 1-4, you know not to get attached to anyone.  Really happy with the character development (new and old characters) and plot line.  A lot of shows start to move south after a few seasons and the original intentions of the writers have dried up, but this one is still going strong.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the earlier seasons.

This is funny since at first, when it first came out, you really couldn't get me to sit down and watch it. Things changed during Season 3. As a matter of fact, I went back and watched it from the very beginning...Season 1. I think the viewer will have a better appreciation of the characters and how they've evolved during the apocalypse if you watch it from the very beginnning.

7146617,5,B00WNBABVC,"Walking Dead is one of my favorite programs. Season 5 was full of surprises and lots of deaths of people you come to know along the way. It's amazing to thing if we had to deal with this what would be the repercussions. Can't imagine the stress these guys live under. This is not just about zombies, this is about human nature and how it behaves when it's under stress with your backs against the wall. Who do you trust? Who do you be cautious of? Are they one and the same people? Life has changed for ever for these people, but they still don't give up home.",1426896000,,560,4.194444444444445

The main reason I give this season, as well as the entire series overall, is the shows uncanny abort to re-invent itself. The sub plots have been consistently interesting. The acting and casting has been very strong. The special effects are top notch and plentiful (yay for us gore hounds!). As someone who has seen more Zombie Genre Movies than most, (from NOTLD to Italian and Spanish to modern day reboots, etc), I can say in all honesty that this show will not disappoint.",1426896000,,611,4.666666666666667

I care about the main characters on this series because they're surviving while preserving their grasp on what is good in humanity.  The world they live in is horrible and the situations they find themselves in are testing them in so many ways.  The show is like classical Greek drama and myth with heroes and villains and blood and horror and the plot of who is stronger and why.  Rick's group is stronger, vanquishing enemies like 'the governor' and Terminus because they care about each other and support each other.  They maintain a basic sense of right & wrong even though they fail sometimes.  My big question w/this series is - what is the cost of survival?",1426723200,,786,4.5

7146891,5,B00WNBABVC,"My favorite character is Carol.  What the writers have done with her role and how well she made that role work are astonishing.  Sunday's show raised an interesting question in my mind.
Carol to Rick (re Pete) ""You're going to have to kill him.""
That certainly is one conclusion.  And without Shane around to beat him into submission that may be the only conclusion from Carol's rather unique and practical perspective.

It is the Hobson's Choice though.  Because Pete is the doctor.  I'm unaware of any other doctors.  And a van load of wounded coming in.  Best answer?  Don't know...

What I do know is this - Alexandria is no paradise.  Even for the Alexandrians.  Deanna is as ruthless of Carol but I prefer Carol - at least she is not a politician!  And besides, I like cookies.",1426550400,,783,4.586956521739131

7146923,5,B00WNBABVC,"I have cable but am new to the walking dead. I really watched it one day as a joke because I thought it was like one of those stupid zombie movies that's  more pointless and gruesome without any real plot than anything else. I'll be the first to admit boy was I wrong. The creator of this show deserve every award there is and a few that don't exist.  I was hook from the very first episode  up to the most recent one. I love the fact that the writer makes most of the main characters so likeable that you feel almost heartbroken when one them  looses the battle against the zombies. I actually watched ""Z"" Nation first which made me curios about the walking dead. I really thought it was as stupid and poorly written as that badly written show. ( I don't know if they have a second season but if they do I won't bother with it) I watched all of the older seasons on Netflix and wanted to catch up on the latest episodes I had missed on cable so this was the perfect choice because demand no longer had them. It was like paying twice for the same thing but I don't care I need my Walking Dead fix.:)",1426464000,,1099,4.121495327102804

7146925,1,B00WNBABVC,"I guess anyone who watches walking dead for more than b movie zombie thrills should have seen this coming, right? I mean, season five was too good to be true. Great writing, great acting, great story... it was finally the walking dead we've all been waiting for, and it only took five years to figure it out. After the crew arrives in Alexandria, the stage is set for a slow and tense psychological drama with occasional intense zombie action for the gore hungry viewers who just can't go one episode without it, and episode 13 ends with a demented Rick apparently sympathizing with a zombie beyond their walls. Bravo, Gimple. Now, suddenly, all the good things they've done all season are put in a pile together and ceremoniously shat on. Character development? Only if you're going to kill them that episode! Is the character black? EVEN BETTER! We all know black characters MUST DIE on The Walking Dead (unless of course they have boobs. Has anyone noticed boobs keep you alive way more than anything else in the Zombie apocalypse?). By the way- did you think maybe we had something to worry about with this gun toting Tobin character? Naw. Why not make him, and every single other person in this outrageously stable community, COMPLETELY useless- like red shirts on Star Trek. Hey- remember that INCREDIBLE scene with Carol and the little boy Sam from last episode? I've got an idea. Let's make them close friends IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT. Hey, remember how Deryl was real thankful for the bike parts Aiden offered him, and it was super touching? Instead of doing more interesting character development with that exchange, like showcasing CONVERSATIONS between them while they work on said bike, let's just say Deryl built his bike LITERALLY OVERNIGHT! FROM SCRATCH! Let's also say that Alexandria's two man recon crew are more petrified of walkers than Eugene, even though we JUST saw that they had one strung up in the woods to play with (and by the way, a two man recon crew... that's all they have? There are zero smoke and mirrors involved in this thing? The lady in charge has absolutely no ulterior motive or secret she's holding onto?). Literally nothing in this episode made sense, and Walking Dead has once again descended to the level of zombie soap opera. What hurts isn't that it happened, what hurts is that it KEEPS happening... the cosmic irony being that the new ""twist"" in this episode's finale is an abusive relationship that Rick (apparently) will have no choice but to just straight up murder a dude over (as if there is no other option to even consider in the mind of Carol), since I've personally been in a very similar abusive relationship with Walking Dead for YEARS. It always tells me it loves me, then it hits me, then I keep coming back for more (and here we are again). The sloppy writing is back in spades, with characters making decisions that largely make no sense, character development almost exclusively leading up to that character's death, and peripheral characters doing and saying things are are clearly only in the script so that they can end the season with a pointless and masturbatory show down in Alexandria that will ALSO make no sense. If anyone liked this episode, I'm not sorry for you, I just wish you would stop telling Walking Dead you love it while it F*%$s you. I'm on my way to finally leaving this abusive relationship, myself.",1426464000,3,3385,4.758503401360544

7147011,4,B00WNBABVC,"Based on character appeal and dramatic anticipation, I should give this season a 5 star, but sometimes it gets frustrating as the group dwindles down and the zombies seem to be winning a war of attrition.  I was really ""bummed"" when Tyree was killed, and it made no sense to kill Beth(?) right after reuniting with her.  That's the dramatic anticipation--there is always something bad waiting to happen to this group of survivors led by Glen and Rick, Mecchone (sic) and Daryl, especially as you become emotionally invested in the characters. The creators of the show know this and use it to their advantage in moving the storyline forward. Since this is not a ""and they lived happily ever after"" kind of series, it's getting harder to watch because it always feels like some important character's death is ""just around the corner""; and the locations that appear to be a Haven (e.g., the Prison and Terminus) and seem to be the safest consistently turn out to be the worst places to settle down.  ""Starting over""repeatedly  becomes the Mantra for the series, but each event causes a little more of the survivors' humanity to be lost.  Very troubling.",1426204800,,1150,4.817258883248731

7147091,5,B00WNBABVC,"As a writer myself, I believe that this has a lot of elements that blend well. The scenes of the individuals don't detract from the story, but gives a much deeper understanding the ""Human"" aspect of the characters that other shows or movies lack. I believe in many ways, that this show is a reflection of the human psyche that may of us endure in our lives. From poverty, to natural disasters, or a series of bad luck that plague us, we can relate to this on many levels. I sense the realism in this, and also sense that no matter where Rick and the group ends up, the idea of a Utopia will not exist for them because of so many problems with other people. A part of them is still not trusting fully, and even if Alexandria does work out, that knowledge of the past will always be a part of them. Like post tramautic Stress disorder, it takes time and therapy, and this group has it in the spades. Great show, hope to see healing on many levels!",1426118400,,945,4.226519337016574

7147183,3,B00WNBABVC,"I love twd. It's an amazing show with a great story like. The characters are easy to associate in both their good and bad moments. Now about this season...

The first several episodes jump a lover the place. I believe there was an artistic attempt at making the audience feel how ""they had been out there almost to long"". This results in the episodes being choppy and at times it's had  to follow. When one of our main characters dies there is an attempt to make it moving but I was left staring at the screen blankly thinking ""wow I liked that person. Man they butchered that death scene."" When you stop thinking about the characters in a show as people and start becoming aware of how the story was shot that means it's not being shot right.

Sad about this season. I did like how they shot the last few episodes though I haven't watched the very last episode and don't know how the story ends... I do know that the last few before that actually make sense again and prevented me from totally deserting twd.

There's stars because I like the series but this season is my least favorite by a long shot. Can't wait to see what they do next.",1425945600,2,1140,4.338028169014085

7147240,2,B00WNBABVC,"As with most of the Walking Dead episodes, the writers create harrowing situations--over and over again--by having the characters make stupid decisions or by using man-of-few-words miscommunications whereby crucial information is not shared between people who supposedly care about each other. Time and time again, characters split up, walk off without telling anyone where they're going. How many times has one member of the group searched a room *alone*? They get distracted, ponder the meaningless of existence, and then (wow, didn't see that coming) a walker sneaks up on them from behind.

How is it that mindless walkers can travel silently in a woods filled with dead twigs and leaves? But when it comes to bad guys, the walkers almost always make some sound allowing the bad guy to dispatch the walker.

This is just indicative of laziness on the part of the writers. If this show was billed like a campy TV show, similar to the way the old Batman TV show was campy, then it would work. But The Walking Dead takes itself seriously.",1425945600,3,1039,4.8977272727272725

7147431,5,B00WNBABVC,"More than halfway through Season 5, this is still one of the most compelling character dramas on cable television. The violence and gore may turn off some people, and the inconsistent pacing of the plot may turn off others, but these complaints are generally minor and in my opinion can't outweigh the quality writing, acting, special effects and cinematography. Everyone has their favorite characters and favorite moments. Skeptics can wonder how a show about zombies can be so popular. The answer is: it's not about zombies. It's about people in the most dire circumstances, doing whatever it takes not only to survive, but to truly live, and the show as always does a great job of making that philosophical distinction, constantly digging into the deep and often uncomfortable underpinnings of human nature to craft an evocative drama that will scare you, maybe horrify you, but most of all make you think.

I'm saying the show is good, basically.",1425859200,,950,5.012658227848101

I am sorry - I don't see the disclaimer anywhere that states you will have to wait for the next day to watch the Walking Dead.
I am sure Amazon knows how Facebook works. Everyone I know gets to watch it before me and posts the big news.
Amazon should have made this very clear. It does say allows you to stream ""instantly"".

7147443,1,B00WNBABVC,"This is not a review for the season of the Walking Dead, but as a warning to anyone considering throwing their money down the rabbit hole of a ""season pass"". It boggles the mind how Amazon could have such shoddy technical service in their company. 2 weeks ago we had a situation where the episode wasn't available for viewing until over 14 hours after the air date. A week later we're subjected to an episode with NO AUDIO (was fixed about 14 hours + after air date). Now we have the latest episode appearing on our ""season pass"" as a purchase only title.
Here's a tip: stop letting interns and/or outsourced cheap labor run this streaming service, it's making you all look like amateurs and really tarnishing your usually spotless business. Can't wait to see how they screw it up next week.",1425859200,8,791,4.577464788732394

With that said, I am having the same issue as it is asking me to buy the new episode regardless of my season pass. But you and I should be contacting Amazon about it, not complaining about it on a review message board.",1425859200,5,438,4.688311688311688
7147448,1,B00WNBABVC,"Great show, but the Amazon Instant Video Service leaves much to be desired.  To clarify, the service it's self works fine, but the accounting and accuracy of your purchased shows is horrible to pathetic.  Again, the Walking Dead's current episode, which aired last night, has been made available on this service, however, it is showing that I need to purchase this episode.  Well Mr. Amazon, I already did.  You want to charge me again?  WTF?  I'm sure this will be fixed and the show will be available, as it should already be, sometime within the next 3 or 4 days.  This is not the first time something like this have happened, nor the second.  Huge FAIL.  It's a great show though.

7147524,3,B00WNBABVC,"I'm very quickly losing interest in the WD.  I stopped watching after Coda (the end of the hospital) because it's not a series I look forward to anymore.  I'm writing this review with the hope that maybe some of the writers will see this review, or another like it, and take these criticisms to heart for season 6.  Okay, that's not likely to happen.  I mainly just want to vent at how sucky the show has become while I'm waiting for my ambien to kick in :)

spoilers.. and things I wish they did differently... major spoilers

The cannibals were really cool and I like how they had no illusions about themselves-- ""yeah sure we're bad guys.  But we gotta eat.""  And saying that pretty people taste better.. I'm sure they're right!  There was so much material there, but they just quickly tied it up and jumped to the prison.  I mean farm.  No wait, this year it was a hospital.

But here's my biggest problem with the series-- it's becoming far too predictable.  spoilers... In the first episode, the black guy was a decent human being who hadn't yet lost all hope.. So there was NO DOUBT in my mind that he'd be killed off in a gruesome fashion.  There should be SOME DOUBT for the series to be interesting, right?!  Don't get me wrong, I liked the scene where they were eating his leg, but the pattern of killing nice people is far too obvious.  It's expected, and boring.

Then there's Beth.  Poor sheepish, mousy, rape-bait Beth.  Did anyone think for a second she'd make it out of there alive?  I sure didn't.  That obvious pattern off killing everyone who isn't totally jaded or killing people the second their guard drops is getting annoying.  I guess you're only supposed to become invested in characters who no longer care if they live or die.  Or the 4 main cast members.  I honestly had a doomsday tracker in my brain for Beth, and I  was actually shocked when it looked for second like I might have been wrong.  I also had another doomsday tracker for the big black guy who lost his nerve.  Just wait, once he becomes a bigger part of the story, he's also a goner!  I think the four main cast members are safe, which is why always killing off the likeable people just  comes off as gimmicky to me, and without any real bite.  It's like politicians who throw a lackey under a bus.  It's cheap and just makes me resentful of the series.

And then there's Eugene.  more spoilers.  Honestly, how many people out there thought he was a fake?  I suspect quite a few; I know I did.  It was his mannerisms and 'explanations', sure.  But mainly every time.. let me repeat.. EVERY TIME there's a shred of hope, it gets extinguished.  I get that this is a bleak series.  But constantly dangling hope in front of the audience and then yanking it away (both in terms of plots and killing likeable characters) makes the series repetetive.  For the last few seasons, far too many things were predictable.  And now I'm seeing Rick Grimes as one dimensional.  His last name is 'grimes' because he's always covered in grime.  Wash off your face once in a while!  The series has become obvious with too many closeups, forced moods, predictable deaths, predictable appearances of zombies, with each season only differing by locale.

And where do all the zombies come from?  They remind me of lightning or thunder to help set the mood for a powerful scene.  Sure, people die and get turned into walkers, but it's never just one zombie.  There's always a handful, and they're always just inside the treeline.  You'd think ten years into the zombie  apocalypse there would be stretches of real estate free from walkers.  One year into the apocalypse sure.. you pull off the road, scrape the guts off your windshield, and five walkers emerge.  Now.. I know they gotta follow the graphic novel, but I'd have zombies either evolve a bit, or else get even crazier after eating on other zombies.  I honestly prefer Z- Nation to Walking Dead.  In that series, if someone tries to lighten the mood by telling a damn joke, the writers don't instantly kill them off just to force that constant somber mood.

Look Mr. Walking Dead writer guys.. You're losing audience members.  Okay, that's not true, you're gaining a bigger audience each year.  But just because a show becomes more and more popular doesn't make it more better.",1425600000,2,4308,4.56544502617801

Are we supposed to believe the dead killed every living creature except the characters and other twisted people? Why is there no lovable and heroic dog?  Why don't the characters go fishing? Why don't the characters have carefully crafted proceedures for survival instead of a rough shod strategy?  Why haven't the characters obtained good RV's to travel about the land in style while attempting to master their new world.  Mad Max was a survivor.

Instead of focusing on the characters excercising new and interesting survival strategies, with interesting dialogue we get stale flat dialogue, and now the infection of political correctness with a couple of gay characters.

7147676,5,B00WNBABVC,"The Walking Dead is absolutely my favorite show to watch each week, and it is so much better without commercials constantly interrupting the flow. However, I completely agree with those reviewers who thought the injection of the politically correct hollywood liberal gay agenda was a really bad idea. Though it was not on the same scale, it reminded me of how I felt when Latifa conducted a bunch of gay marriages during the academy awards, thereby taking clear advantage of an unsuspecting, captive audience without any concern at all about the feelings of many members of that worldwide audience who fully reject that agenda and felt horribly ambushed. That being said, I will not allow that poor judgment to stop me from what otherwise is an excellent production. Just my opinion, but I am going to stick with it.",1425254400,,816,4.877697841726619

7147693,5,B00WNBABVC,"Title says a lot. No rain, water or food (kind of) on their trip to DC. It pushed them, but they always stick together. It shows, they've been 'out there too long' though. In the first bit... The rest I won't talk about. It sets up the next episode really well and transitions from the Georgia to North East. Its an awesome episode, but they're showing a lot of wear and tear and exhaustion. I give it 5 stars... Oh... It also shows that even wildlife is having a difficult time against the walkers. They're truly the bane of life and appear to be winning. The real meaning behind what the term 'The Walking Dead' is finally revealed too! It's not what we all thought, and its pretty darn dark and morbid... Love it!!!!",1425254400,,719,4.373134328358209

It's not realistic that large there is no attempt that survivors have not cleared roads, taken oil plants, electrical plants, set up communications and started rebuilding. There would be enough experts, books and training material to start picking up the pieces and rebuilding.

I like the episodes that occur in the empty, post apocalyptic cities.

But it' hard to suspend disbelief with this series.  Blood in their eyes and mouth never cause them to ""turn,"" but scratching and biting does.  Yet, those boney fingers never seem to inflict a single scratch in the five years and hundreds of ZOMBIES the scantly clad crew encounter.",1425081600,,715,4.884297520661157

Season 3 started to slow down but was still amazine.... But season 4 things really started to drag out. Season 5 is even slower, they are really stretching the action out as far as they can. I still love the ""series"" but this season is starting to get lame. A handful of episodes followed by a ""mid season finally"" and a long break, then a few more episodes till the season finally is really spreading this show thin. If they don't pick things up a lot, I will loose interest for a season 6.",1425081600,,648,4.134920634920635

He was RIGHT!  The interaction among humans trying to survive in a catastrophic world, the assertion of good and evil, the human strength to withstand extreme hardship, are things well represented in the show. There are integrity vs. disloyalty, trust vs. deception, wisdom vs.  naivety and malevolence vs. good It's addicting, like the old ""serials"" at the movies.  (Only we older guys will remember those).  The acting in The Walking Dead is very good.  It gets gory at times, but that's just part of it...

I can't stand when this happens to a great show.  They run out of ideas and have to resort to lame political agendas to fill in major gaps in story line.  The season's plots are beginning to get redundant.  Every time they find a group of survivors that seem good, they end up being worse than the walkers.  In my mind this series is the beginning of the end of a great show.  I wouldn't waste your time.  Stick with the first 4 seasons and  walk away satisfied.",1424908800,,634,4.305084745762712

Is this the final season of Walking Dead? I am not seeing much new or fresh, their disappointment is not just predictable it is becoming a rut.

Was there ever a black male character the average young man would feel good about hearing they remind their friends of?
It is good to have the group find a decent stash of food. How about weapons and ammo, a decent stash of ammo  they can return to in order to stock up, or create emergency stashes from?

They act like we, the viewers, have done something wrong, and that couldn't be further from the truth.  They need to take ownership of the problem and fix it, and if they can't do it, then go up the food chain until they find someone who can fix it.
They wanted me to change my settings on my computer to watch it and hear it.  I refused to fool with my settings, they work here and everywhere else and who knows what changing them will do to my computer.  My computer isn't broken and I can hear the rest of the series and other movies and tv shows.  Why would I change my computer when it's not my computer that's broken?
When they put this show (and all the others, I'm sure) they DO NOT check to see if they work.  That makes no sense.
They have no clue as to when it will be fixed.  But if you want some compensation, you'll have to call them to get it.",1424649600,4,1063,4.101449275362318

7148309,5,B00WNBABVC,"I wrote this review to help folks who are experiencing sound issues. I had the same issues when trying to play episode 11 with Silverlight. If you are watching on a PC (not sure about Mac or other devices), you can go to ""settings"" in the top right section of the screen, scroll down, and click on the option to watch the show with Adobe Flash instead of Microsoft Silverlight, then reload the video and watch it. The streaming quality didn't seem to be as good as when played with Silverlight, but the sound works with Flash.

Other than that, I would say that the Walking Dead is more of an ""experience"" rather than a ""TV Show."" It provides great fodder for thought and conversation, for appropriate audiences. Enjoy!",1424649600,2,719,4.573643410852713

Initial Question: Downloaded the walking dead season 5 episode 11 , and there is no sound

06:56 AM PST Shakil(Amazon): Hello, my name is Shakil. I'm here to help you today.
I'm very sorry about this.
There is a technical error with the episode. Our technical team is aware about this and they are actively working to resolve it.
May I know on which device you were streaming the episode?
06:56 AM PST anthony: Ipad
06:57 AM PST Shakil(Amazon): At this time, I'm afraid you won't receive the audio while you play the video in your iPad. However, if you play the episode in your PC or Mac after selecting Flash as your default web player, the audio should work.
06:59 AM PST anthony: Is there an estimated time on when the issue will be resolved, this is the only episode I've ever had this problem with.

I know it will eventually get corrected like Episode 10 did, but I run the risk of hearing spoilers at work today.",1424649600,10,326,4.491525423728813
7148415,5,B00WNBABVC,Was unable to hear sound on this episode..... Have had no other issues with sound until this episode.,1424649600,14,101,4.666666666666667
7148416,1,B00WNBABVC,Love the show but upset no volume! I can watch everything else with volume. What is up?,1424649600,10,87,4.176470588235294
7148417,1,B00WNBABVC,scam! I bought season 5 pass and then I had to pay for episode 11. And there is no audio sound to watch it on my tv or laptop. So I downloaded the app to try to watch it on my phone. But still no sound. It's 5 am so let's see how long it takes Amazon to fix this bugs. I'm buying the next season on target.,1424649600,4,306,3.514705882352941
7148418,5,B00WNBABVC,"I too had no sound for Ep11 and about lost it; even rebooted my computer. Was NOT willing to wait so contacted Customer Service--problem on PC & Mac is Microsoft Silverlight (MS causing a prob?! Go figure!! lol) Need to go into your Video Library and then Settings; change it from using 'recommended' MS Silverlight to Adobe Flash and POOF! *Sound works like magic*!! SO relieved since I stay up late to watch this soon as they're released each week :) NOW, after getting to watch it, waiting for the beginning of NEXT weeks episode is gonna 'slay' me; quite a cliffhanger! lol. **Unfortunately I don't know what will help those on Android devices since Adobe, for their inscrutable ridiculous reasons, stopped supporting Flash for Android! If you're trying to watch on an Android device and have access to a PC or Mac, try that and change these settings instead if you want to watch ASAP (I know I always do!) Hope this helps some of my fellow frustrated fans! :) **EDIT-- More detailed instructions in case the original ones weren't specific enough and and perhaps why a few people voted this Unhelpful:
Hover over ""Your Account"" >>Select/click on ""Your Video Library"" in drop down list >>Find and click on ""Settings"" (on upper right menu bar just below the larger bar with Your Account, Cart etc. It may ask you to log in at this juncture.) >>On ""Settings"" page scroll down to ""Player Preferences""; that's where you'll find the place to switch to Adobe Flash Player to get sound.",1424649600,10,1482,4.725868725868726
