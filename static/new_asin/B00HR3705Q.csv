6198951,5,B00HR3705Q,"If you've never seen Bleach you are missing out. This is one series worth investing in, even though some people think the series is too long.",1398556800,,141,4.461538461538462
6198952,5,B00HR3705Q,"This is a great set so much action! DVD is in perfect condition also, this was an overall great purchase!",1398384000,,105,4.3
6198953,5,B00HR3705Q,"I will simply say I have loved this series since I first saw my first episode on Adult swim in 2008. Since that time I have collected every episode in some fashion ever since. This has become my all time favorite, absolutely do not miss, television show of all time.

However with that being said I must express my displeasure at the cheapening of the DVD case over time. It has come to the point where the case is so bad a simple sneeze could break this case. If I am going to pay $30 dollars for what has become two dvds covering the same number of episodes that used to come on three or more dvds (which obviously affects the recording quality though most probably won't notice it) the least this company can do is provide a sturdy case. I mean really, at retail a quality case costs no more than $0.25, so what's the big problem providing a quality case. Cost effective is one thing, being absolutely miserly cheap is quite another. Really Viz, I know you can do better than this.

Amazon also needs to be careful as they are rapidly becoming my do not buy from company. I got this cheaper elsewhere with free shipping even after giving them notice of said cheaper price well in advance of my purchase. I will most certainly not purchase any more used items graded by Amazon as they obviously do not know anything about grading. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... well you get the point.

Looking forward to the return of Bleach and if you really are a Bleach fan you won't regret getting this set.",1396828800,,1511,4.370106761565836
6198954,5,B00HR3705Q,Bleach is a really good show I been watching it for about 7 years now and still enjoy to watch it,1396828800,,97,3.6666666666666665
6198955,5,B00HR3705Q,"I bought this item because I have all of the previous box sets to Bleach. This box set has a lot of exciting battles, the top 3 Espadas finish their battles when the Visords join in & Kaname Tosen finishes his battle with Sajin Komomura. There are a few few more battles that don't last as long but are still pretty good ones & there is 1 really weird episode on this box set.",1395792000,3,376,4.094594594594595

If you're up for it, the manga is better, which I don't always say because I adore watching the colors play out on screen.",1520985600,,368,4.111111111111111
