657130,4,6303451543,"Blake Edwards and Dudley Moore, who worked together brilliantly in 1979's 10, re-teamed in 1984 for a fast-paced, surprisingly funny farce. Newsman Moore meets cellist Amy Irving and falls in love, so when she becomes pregnant, he marries her. One minor hitch: Moore is still married to judge Ann Reinking, who's also pregnant. Moore runs himself ragged living two lives until both women go into labor on the same day. So, how do you make a really funny movie about bigamy that brings laughs without leaving a bad taste in your mouth? Answers: 1) Get Blake Edwards to direct it; 2) Don't give him a lot of time to second-guess himself. After getting fired from the Clint Eastwood-Burt Reynolds film City Heat (he may have quit, reports vary), Edwards latched onto Micki's script and managed to get it completed and into theaters the same month as the film he was bounced from. The tight production schedule probably worked to Edwards's benefit, since he didn't get the time to indulge his tendency to tinker and re-shoot scenes until they've become obvious and heavy-handed (see Blind Date for an example). The three leads are terrific, and there are nice supporting turns from character actors Richard Mulligan, Wallace Shawn and Lu Leonard. The letterboxed DVD is a must for this film: Edwards is one of the only comedy directors who can effectively use widescreen, but the results are pretty much unwatchable on pan-and-scan VHS. If the idea of a farce about bigamy doesn't rankle you, this is a lot of fun. It also may be the last great movie Dudley Moore ever made.",1068508800,,1570,4.818518518518519
657131,5,6303451543,"I have seen this movie countless times and it never gets old! Dudley Moore, Amy Irivng and Anne Reinking do an excellant job.
Moore is a tv reporter married to Reinking who just wants to have a baby. Reinking does too but she seems to busy to have one. One night Moore meets Irving playing in an orchestra and sparks fly. When Moore wants to break it off with irving she tells him shes pregant. he says he will marry her and divorce Reinking. But then Reinking tells him shes pregant and wants to have a job and a baby. so what's moore to do? marry them both!
  This is a touching and funny movie that actually gets to you. you feel sorry for moore's character even though hes being a scumbag! The ending wraps things up a bit too neatly but how else could it have ended huh? I like the end song ""something new in my life"" as well. see it and you will be surprised at how good it is. I have not seen reinking in too many films beside this and annie. whatever happened to her? she is such a good actress. so is Irving.",1058572800,,1017,4.105527638190955
657132,5,6303451543,"I've loved this movie for years! It's touching and funny and a great film if you want to just enjoy a funny movie. All actors are outstanding, and Moore, Irving and Reinking really show the heart as well as the humor.",967593600,10,217,4.317073170731708
657133,5,6303451543,"If you don't believe a comedy about bigamy can be made without making one or all of the characters unsympathetic you're in for a big surprise here. The description of this movie's plot doesn't do it justice, on paper this  sounds like it woud be either a morose character drama or an all out farce  with card board cut-outs for characters. This is a very warm film.
  The  French director Loius Malle once made a film made a film called Murmer of  The Heart 1971 where he got the audience not only accepting incest, but  seeing as a natural progression of the events on screen. Blake Edward's  achivement here is just as great, with the help of the wonderful Dudley  Moore he is able to win the audience's sympathy for his lead character Rob  Salinger. As played by Moore he is a man so sincere in his love for both  women, and his desire for children, that you feel guilty questioning his  judgement.
  Every scene in the film is like a delicious little snack,  each with its own setup, emotional center and punchline. Take for example  the wonderful early scene when Rob first meets Maude the cellist as part of  his report on the Cambodian symphony(he also does stories on underwear for  animals and nudists' right to bare arms) and we discover how correspondents  really do their interviews. Or the scene where he meets her father, suffice  to say he is not what Rob had in mind. Continuing the metaphor, I guess the  inspired climax in the hospital makes for a great desert. The film does  drag a bit after that, but there are complex issues the film has to resolve  here.
  Edwards never lets any of his characters become caricatures, or  take take any short cuts . Indeed you'll always be wondering how on earth  he's going to manage to end this thing. I do thing the ending is too  clever, and ofcourse in real life there would have been more heartbreak,  but thats not something the audience is going to stand for.
  Micki+Maude is one of the best and most original comedies of the 1980s, if  nothing else its worth watching for Moore's wonderful performance. Its a  wonderful film.",956707200,8,2091,4.549865229110512

REVIEW

""Micki and Maude"" uses what is an unpalatable subject for a lot of people, and tells a story of heart, wit, and humane sensibilities.  It is a very good mature comedy from director Blake Edwards which stars Dudley Moore, Ann Reinking, and Amy Irving.

Mr. Moore is Rob Salinger, a newsman happily married to wife Micki who ends up falling in love with an attractive cellist named Maude Guillory.  He never falls out of love with Micki, but as he tells his best friend Leo,...""I don't want to divorce Micki!! I just want to marry Maude!!!""  He does marry Maude, with results on his very busy home life both humorous and realistically disastrous.

The movie's real thematic triumph is in exploring the unpredictability of love in a world that wants to define everything, and especially married life, as inherently predictable.  Dudley Moore gives an awesomely layered dry comic performance as Rob, with equally fine support from Ann Reinking as Micki and Amy Irving as Maude.

Also featuring Lu Leonard, Wallace Shawn and an unlikely cameo appearance from the late wrestler known as Andre The Giant, ""Micki and Maude"" is a heartfelt, intelligent success.",1301788800,3,1222,4.980295566502463
657490,5,6303451543,"Micki and Maude is so funny, original, and heartwarming film about a man who is married to two women and trying to keep the truth from slipping out. Dudley Moore is perfectly cast as Rob, Amy Irving and Ann Reinkling star as Rob's two brides. Directed by Blake Edwards, Micki and Maude is just one laugh and mishap after the other. I love, love, love this film, after all these years, this movie is still a riot. I highly recommend this comedic look at a bigamist with a heart of gold. Enjoy!",1189641600,,492,4.358695652173913
657491,2,6303451543,"I picked up this movie after not seeing it in nearly 20 years.  I didn't understand it then, being just as kid, and I still don't understand it now as an adult.

Dudley Moore made a career out of playing lovable, everyman characters who have human foibles (alcoholism for example).  In this case it was infidelity.  Dudley plays Rob, a man married to Micki, a powerhouse attorney who is not ready for (nor seems to want) children despite his wants.  Loosing his interest because his wife doesn't share his same wants, Rob begins an affair with a cellist named Maude.  Maude seems sweet and ernest, and she wants children just as much as Rob does.  Maude discovers that she is pregnant, and Rob decides that he is going to leave Micki for the woman who is willing to have a family with him.  When he is about to tell Micki this, Micki surprises him by telling him that she too is pregnant.  Rob, in a series of screwball comic antics (it is a Blake Edwards movie, after all), is dashing in between the two women, living a double life as a husband to both women.  In an inevitable coincidence, both Micki and Maude give birth in the same hospital on the same day, and his double life is discovered.

Bigamy is not funny, even if Blake Edwards is making a movie about how hilarious it can be.  As an adult, I have had the privilage of seeing firsthand how infidelity has hurt both men and women, not to mention children.  It's irresponsible and self centered.  Rob is certainly not a typical bigamist, who is using and abusing women to support himself financially, not caring if any children are produced from the unions, then moves on to the next unsuspecting victim in another city.  He seems to really love both of them.  But, he's a coward.  If he was a stand up guy, he would have done the right thing and ended one or both of the relationships.  End of story.

And that ending?  WTF is with that ending?!  I can understand that both of the women, despite being shattered by his deception, would want to see him at least a few more times.  And being that they both had children by him, despite his deception, he does have a right to see his kids if he wants to.  But we see both women moving on in their careers (Micki as a judge, Maude as a concert cellist), and Rob is in the park with a bunch of kids running around him calling him Daddy?!?!  What does that mean?!  They both continue to see him, both have more kids with him, but HE takes care of them!?!?!?  I gave this 2 stars for the comic antics only that pulled a few laughs here and there, but otherwise it deserved 1 based on that ending.",1184025600,5,2601,4.333333333333333
657492,5,6303451543,"Dudley Moore is the villain in this one but it is hard not to root for him. He plays the supportive husband of Ann Reinking.

All he wants to do is be a father but his wife is busy working on a political campaign. She promises they will settle down when it is over. When it ends, she is instead rewarded with a judgeship in another city which she has to take. That leaves Dudley back home and lonely, mourning for the kids he is sure he will never have.

That's when he meets Amy Irving. She is a cellist he interviews and they share some type of spark with each other right away. He is not the type to be an adulterer but the situation gets the best of him because he feels abandoned by his own wife. He and Amy fall in love and he decides to get a divorce from Ann so he can settle down with Amy and have kids.

If it were that simple, though, there would not really be a movie here. Just as he gets ready to tell Ann the news, she tells him that she is pregnant from their last conjugal visit. Amy turns up pregnant at the same time. Since he really loves them both, he cannot bring himself to divorce Ann nor can he stop himself from marrying Amy. Neither knows about the other and it is slapstick as he tries to manage his life to keep both of his secrets. Needless to say, the world conspires against him.

When both women head into labor at the same time, the secret comes out with disastrous consequences for the guy who only ever wanted to be a dad.

This one is comedy throughout.",1174262400,,1490,4.089041095890411
657493,5,6303451543,"This film released in late 1984,is about a married man named Rob Salinger(the late Dudley Moore) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage. Rob is a newspaper editor married to Micheline ""Micki"" Salinger(Ann Reinking),a judge. While secretly romancing Maude(Amy Irving),he proposes to her(Maude). Rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes,they(the women) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages. But Rob keeps both wives. In the real world,bigamy is undoubtedly illegal. Director Blake Edwards' previous film credits include BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and THE PINK PANTHER. Subsequently,he directed the late John Ritter in 1989's SKIN DEEP.",1110499200,,703,5.769230769230769
657494,4,6303451543,"Sorry, if you missed the humor in my review title. It's actually a quote from the film itself. And I don't memorize line from movies, unless they've really made some kind of impression , on me. ""Micki and Maude"" was impressionable , because it's hilarious. Not hilarious, like ""The Jerk"", or ""Dumb and Dumber"". It's not that kind of film. Rather it's hilarious, in the sense of it's dry wit and added humor ,into everyday life situations. Not overplayed or over the top. Hollywood doesn't make too many films like this anymore and that makes ""Micki and Maude"" , even more enjoyable. This is one of those ,little ,jewels, of a film , that has escaped the popularity and credit , that it's worth. I originally , saw ""Micki and Maude"" , back in the 80's , on HBO. I  was a huge Dudley Moore fan , and so that was the initial appeal , and he's very funny as the story's leading character ( Rob ). I'm also a huge Blake Edwards fan , and this story is exemplirary of his directing and  hilarious writing skills. Richard Mulligan also adds to this hilarious farce about a married man ( Dudley Moore ) , who falls for an ambitious , talented and very beautiful younger woman ( played by Amy Irving ). Things get complicated , as Rob ( Dudley Moore) tries to cover it up , from his wife and tries to keep his wife a secret from his mistress. If that sounds tricky , add the fact that he's madly in love with both and gets them both pregnant , at the same time. By today's Hollywood standards , this film would never get the greenlight. Simply because the formula of the script is entirely too murky. However , this film proves that with a wonderful script , director, and cast , that it is possible to make a highly entertaining film with this type of material. Moreover, "" Micki and Maude "" is a quaint little film , that harbors alot of it's storyline with chauvenistic themes. But who else can make this theme, more humor filled than Dudley Moore ? I've seen this film, countless times and I enjoy it even more, as I get older. A very funny film , to see on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1102636800,5,2077,4.295918367346939
