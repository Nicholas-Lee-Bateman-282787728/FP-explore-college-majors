If you do NOT like the Kung-Fu violence/action, then this is not for you.
The bad guys (really bad) get wiped out, the good guys win, everyone walks away smiling..... you know, (my hero)typical action movie from back then.
I enjoyed them both because I like the action and the stories..... you know, the good guy is unbeatable, unstoppable, and has all the integrity and honor in the world - all rolled up in his person. Idealism to the max. Enjoy!",1282521600,,532,4.552083333333333
3481629,4,B001B3LIOC,"Can Steven Seagal act?  Well, he's pretty one-dimensional.  In this two pack with both Under Siege and Under Siege 2, Seagal is quiet, humble, handy in the kitchen, relentless, good with improvised explosives, and an experienced hand-to-hand fighter.

If he tries to smile, it looks like he is trying to smile.

HOWEVER, these were truly action movies, with the bad guys really bad and the good guys needing the help of Casey Ryback (Seagal), ex-Navy Seal.  In Under Siege, Tommy Lee Jones plays an eccentric CIA operative who didn't take well to the CIAs attempt to close down his mission by taking him out.  Jones is a great bad guy in this movie (which is the better of the two).

But these movies packed together make them a real bargain.  Worth the investment for the action thriller fan.",1262476800,,793,4.695652173913044

These movies are actually really enjoyable, if not a little (or a lot) unbelievable. Watch the one-man army/retired Navy SEAL that is Steven Seagal's Casey Ryback take out terrorists on a Navy battleship in the first one, and terrorist on a train in the second one. Apparently, Casey Ryback only runs into trouble on some sort of major transportation method. Anyway, both movies are jam packed with tons of awesome action, explosions, and one bad guy even gets his eyes squished out (we watched that part about ten times while laughing until we cried). Fun, with a passably decent plot, and some fantastic one-liners, these movies are a great pick me up!",1236384000,11,796,4.860294117647059
3481631,4,B001B3LIOC,"So many action stars from the 80s & 90s have been the butt of countless jokes.  Jean-Claude Van Damme's newest feature is a parody of his life.  Chuck Norris's popularity is mainly due to thousands of oddball compliments.  And Steven Seagal - the star of these two features - hasn't had a theatrical release since 2003.

Let me be clear: Steven Seagal is not one my favorite actors in any category.  But he does have a few good movies to his name, with these UNDER SIEGE films arguably his best.

*****UNDER SIEGE (1992)*****
The movie that put Seagal on the map was ABOVE THE LAW (1988), a well-constructed crime flick directed by Andrew Davis.  The director & star reunited for UNDER SIEGE, a movie which holds incredibly well for many reasons.  Seagal stars as Casey Ryback, the head cook aboard a Navy battleship about to be decommissioned.  After a scuffle with his psychotic Commander Krill (Gary Busey), Ryback is detained in one of his freezers.  While the crew are having a party on their final voyage, the USS Missouri is taken over by mercenaries covering as caterers & singers.  The leader of the hostage-takers is Strannix, played with maniacal conviction by Tommy Lee Jones.  While it's never quite clear what Strannix & Krill intend to do with the battleship, the fact that it still holds nuclear Tomahawk missiles is enough to scare anybody.

Of course, the movie proceeds with Ryback as a one-man army, taking out the hostage-takers one at a time.  Soon, he runs into a stripper named Jordan, who actually becomes a believable sidekick.  She's not equipped or trained to help Ryback, but we can actually believe that she would go from carrying Ryback's supply bags to eventually firing an automatic weapon.  Rather than one-liners, the script lets Jordan just be a practical tag-along.

What's remarkable about this setup, however, is how patient Davis is with the material.  In the hands of a lesser director, UNDER SIEGE would've been a formulaic blockbuster.  Davis starts slowly, and lets us feel the crew starting to get lax with the routines.  There's no ominous music when the villains board the Missouri; in fact, Tommy Lee Jones makes for a convincing bandleader & blues singer.  The fight sequences aren't elaborate or overly stylish; they're simple & effective.  And Davis allows the actors from all locations (the villains in the control room, the panicked military brass in their command center, & Ryback/Jordan throughout the Missouri) to get their stories in.  The Missouri hostages don't get much development, but who cares, right?

On a production level, UNDER SIEGE scores big time.  It's Sound Mixing & Sound Effects Editing were nominated for Oscars, and they're well-deserved.  The explosions are particularly impressive for 1992, and even little touches like echoes from a ship deck or the cuts from a knifefight are effective.  The film opens with actual footage of George Bush giving a speech with the Missouri in the background (I'm sure this was archival news footage).  The musical score is interesting, because the stealth scenes w/ Ryback hunting the bad guys have a jungle-ish tone.  If you've ever played the videogame METAL GEAR SOLID 2, I think UNDER SIEGE might've been the Tanker score's inspiration.

UNDER SIEGE is still an exceptional action picture.  Andrew Davis & Tommy Lee Jones reteamed the next year for THE FUGITIVE, another impressive thriller.  If you remembered the focused storytelling from that Chicago classic, then you can look forward to UNDER SIEGE.  Definitely check this movie out!

*****UNDER SIEGE 2: DARK TERRITORY (1995)*****
---According to IMDB, the only reason Seagal agreed to star in this sequel was because Warner Bros. allowed him to direct ON DEADLY GROUND, a hypocritically-environmentalist dreck that was a favorite at the Razzies that year.  Thankfully, UNDER SIEGE 2 wasn't nearly as bad.

Like the first UNDER SIEGE movie, DARK TERRITORY is a simple action flick that's made better because of its cast of actors & its violence.  There are a lot of familiar faces to hardcore movie buffs in this one.  I'll keep the intro to the plot short, because the plausibility is quickly thrown out the window.  Casey Ryback is travelling with his niece (a young Katherine Heigl) on a train from Denver to Los Angeles, after her parents were killed in an accident.  On this same train, Travis Dane (some rejected techno-wizard played by Eric Bogosian from LAW & ORDER: CI) holds the government for ransom using a weapons satellite.  And.....that's about all you need to know.

The action sequences are simpler this time, and not nearly as good as the first movie's.  The bad guys take over the train.  Seagal takes them out.  The train stops for a gunfight and mountain climbing, then carries on again.  A female sniper manages pinpoint accuracy atop a moving train.  Seagal covers from gunfire using VERY thin carriage doors.  He manages to drive a pickup, jump out, and hop back onto the train.  You see where I'm going with this?

Another key problem with the movie is Morris Chestnut's performance as the porter.  He's constantly making wisecracks, is constantly afraid AND cocky, and rarely becomes useful to Casey Ryback.  He's a huge step down from the stripper Jordan in the first UNDER SIEGE.

The reason UNDER SIEGE 2 is bearable is because the story is ridiculous from the outset, and sticks to its tone.  The very first scene -- where the CIA launch the weapons satellite -- is filled with that kind of expository dialogue that tells us what's going on, but doesn't sound like a genuine conversation between people.  I like Eric Bogosian, but his performance as the villain is way too self-indulgent.  Everett McGill plays Penn, Dane's number-one thug.  He's actually pretty solid in this movie, and even elicits some creepiness when holding Ryback's niece hostage.

It's never boring, and you can have a good time as long as you leave your brain at the door.  There's a neat knifefight where Casey Ryback and Penn --- whose team somehow knows Ryback's SEAL profile? --- duke it out, and Seagal just mercilessly wipes the floor with this leather-donning Cro-Magnon.

Oh, and don't even ask me how Steven Seagal somehow outruns the derailing train after it crashes into another train.

UNDER SIEGE 2: DARK TERRITORY was probably Seagal's last notable flick.  I'm sure most will pass it up, but if you decide to give the man's catalog a chance, then this is one of the better ones.
_________________________________________________________

I highly recommend this Double Pack.  The original UNDER SIEGE is a very underrated action movie, and deserves to be remembered along other 90s hits like TERMINATOR 2 or THE MATRIX.  The sequel isn't necessary viewing, but it barely affects the price, and includes some Seagal theatrical trailers.  So, why not treat yourself to a bonus?

Steven Seagal's career is a joke among jokes.  But even with his ever-growing belly, his elongated leather jackets, and his scraggly sideburns...I'll always enjoy the UNDER SIEGE movies.

3481896,5,B001B3LIOC,"Steven Seagal, like all action artists(Bruce Lee, etc.) is a poor actor who nonetheless generates interest just by a screen presence...the anticipation of action.  When he goes into 'his thing', it's a wonderful demonstration of practical kung fu, judo, etc.
These films are perfect vehicles for Seagal with plots that require him to be the lone hero, saving a group of people from comic book villains.  Like many a film or show before them, the villain's underlings are obviously props for Seagal to 'deal with'.  He does and you can almost see a tally score like a videogame.  The plot in both films is thin, with villains taking over a New Jersey class battleship in one, and a runaway train in another, in both instances trying to make big bucks for high tech hyjacked from the US.

Every time I watch them (and if I trip across them on cable, I'm watching them), I can't help but wonder what a really good script writer could have done with the weak moments.  However, the strong moments - the aforementioned kick-ass scenes, the great one-liners: ""Where's Dahmer?"" ""Probably dead!"" and ""Next thing I know, you'll be dating musicians"", and those amazing boobs definitely add to the good times.

Once again - or better yet, TWICE again - our man Casey emerges from the shadows of obscurity to almost single-handedly combat and eventually destroy some hyper-violent crackpots out to destroy the USA as we know it.  The themes are quite similar, except that Casey has a daughter at risk when he combats the terrorists on the train going through the Rockies.  However, in both cases he emerges victorious, again ""predictably.""  I did enjoy the venue of the USS Missouri as the battleground in Under Siege II, and the Rockies as a backdrop in US I was interesting, and provided different challenges for our guy Casey Ryback.

I think that they could have found some value to his position early on and wrote more about him into the movie.  Having grown up for a few years at Greenham Common Air Force Base in England it is actually scary how close to the mark the writers came in many ways about nuclear weapons and security protocols and so on.

they WERE functioning: all over the floors, but, t-h-a-t was a recent Samual L. Jackson

3481953,5,B001B3LIOC,"I was shopping for a few late night movies and found this interesting double feature DVD on the Wal-Mart five-dollar rack, ""Under Siege and Under Siege 2."" It seemed like an exceptional bargain. It was. I got a lot of enjoyment out of both movies.

Both movies are somewhat similar. Both movies involve a major passenger-carrying vessel and both were commandeered or hijacked. In both cases, Steven Seagal was the all-purpose hero who dispatched the bad guys and saved most of the good guys. In both cases, Seagal was an ex-Navy Seal and in both cases he was a chef. Yes, a chef. In both cases, there was a sweet young lady who partly accompanied him in his rescue efforts. And in both cases, there was a lot of violence and destruction involved in getting the vessel back. It seems that the Seagal people have found an effective formula.

Both movies have a weak and improbable story line, but I don't think most people who attend would mind or even notice. These things were done for the action and for the thrills, and they did quite well. The main difference was that in ""Under Siege"" the vessel was the Battleship Missouri, whereas in ""Under Siege 2"" the vessel was a large fast-moving passenger train. The young lady in ""1"" was a Miss Something or Other who was smuggled aboard in a cake for a party. The young lady in ""2"" was Seagal's niece and they were on a vacation train trip together.

Well, what can I say? They were enjoyable movies. Good acting. Lots of action. Lots of violence. They were funny here and there, depending on your sense of humor. I thought that ""Under Siege 2"" was the better of the two movies by a slight margin. I reviewed ""1"" and gave it four stars. I gave ""2 five stars. In any case, this DVD is certainly an entertainment bargain if you like this sort of thing.

3481955,4,B001B3LIOC,"This seems petty, but I was sort of expecting both movies and all of the extras to be on a single blu ray disk. There are two disks which didn't come properly pushed into their slots so were laying on top of one another. It took me a minute to properly separate them without leaving any scratches or marks. I guess I didn't notice how many disks were in the set and like I said it's not a deal breaker, but if you like me are expecting everything on a single disk if you get the Blu ray version expect two disks that might not be properly secured in their slots. Other than that everything is great two great movies for one great price.",1334188800,2,636,4.137096774193548
