8241188,4,B0011ATK86,"Wow, this was a fun movie.  I picked it up because of two of the five deadly venoms guys are in it, one as a bad guy who is really tough to beat.  There's three parts and it's loaded with plenty of nudity, and great fight scenes.  I don't know what the other guy watched who said it was ""Bad"".",1370908800,,293,3.85
8241189,4,B0011ATK86,"I need to find a copy of Ninja Death 2 because this is a 'to be continued' movie that is all too common in the Kung Fu genre. Let me start by saying -- great movie. There are some crossover characters from some of the 'Venoms' movies which was a pleasant surprise. Here is the basic plot (I hope I get it all straight). Chinese noble family escaping from horde of Japanese ninjas (led by the guy who played Silver Spear in 'The Kid with the Golden Arm' another classic from this era). Two brothers are protecting a baby prince and his older sister the princess. One of the brothers is overwhelmed and left behind with the princess who aparently commits suicide in order to allow one of the brothers to escape with the baby. The movie then leaps forward 18 years (approx 1933) to depict the life of 'Tiger' - a bouncer/spokesman for a local brothel. Good stuff. Trouble starts when Japanese ninjas start appearing and even open a rival brothel nearby. An older 'master' appears and, after dispatching three ninjas in the woods that attack him unawares, tells Tiger that he is in great danger and needs to begin seven stages of serious training. Like all great training sessions, this one is also unconventional. Tiger drinks vinegar and is forced to sit naked between to huge blocks of ice. Will this help him defeat the Ninjas? Tiger is skeptical. The Master goes on some covert ops and discovers that the mysterious character 'Devil Mask' (who is being controlled by a magic flute played by the Japanese mastermind from the begining of the movie) is actually his long lost brother (denoted by the plum tattoo on his forearm). Yes folks, The Master is one of the protectors from the beginning of the movie and Tiger is the little prince 18 years later. The Master's brother is possesed by the evil spell of the bad guy who is apparently obsessed with exterminating the Chinese family of the plum sign (ie. Tiger, his older sister who is still alive somehow and the Master). Meanwhile, Tiger discovers that all the whores in his brothel have been killed and after dispatching the ninja responsible for this calamity falls into a fitful sleep. While he is sleeping, a female ninja sneaks up on him. After noticing that he has a plum tattoo on his chest, she remembers that she was commanded to be a slave to whoever had this tattoo. Tiger awakens and they get it on. They meet up with the master who finally tells the whole story. I assume that the earth shattering climax is in Ninja Death II. Overall a fantastic movie. There is no way that my review can do it justice. It has everything a good Kung Fu movie needs -- a mysterious villian, an old master, an innovative training session, a blind fortune teller and a lot of humor and fighting action. Note: I tried the drinking vinegar and block of ice thing -- it didn't work.",1316217600,,2826,4.554027504911591
8241190,3,B0011ATK86,"One of the most hilariously bad Kung-Fu movies I've ever seen. The martial arts are decent, effects sub-par, and the voice-acting is wretched, but it's stupid and fun. Synergy is a pretty lazy company, not giving any menus, or even credits, but when you're watching a movie called 'Ninja Death', you don't expect high art.",1288656000,,322,4.872727272727273
