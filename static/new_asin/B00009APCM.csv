1881752,5,B00009APCM,"Even as a child I loved the sometimes outrageously funny, sometimes deeply moving tales of Italian village priest Don Camillo and his (seemingly) fiercely atheistic counterpart, communist mayor Peppone. Don Camillo's unorthodox approach to religion includes frequent arguing with Jesus, who does not always approve of Don Camillo's unusual ways to convince his stubborn parishioners. French actor Fernandel was, in my eyes, a perfect Don Camillo with his punishing fists and boat sized feet that could silence opposition with just one step.
Since in my native country all movies are dubbed I do not share the purist opinion that foreign movies should only be seen with subtitles. Wenn there is a more complicated dialogue subtitles do not cover the contents of what is being said. And many people shy away from the strenuous task of having to divide their attention between pictures and subtitles, probably one of the reasons why average Americans do not seem to be much interested in seeing foreign movies...",1069977600,16,1009,5.196319018404908
1881753,4,B00009APCM,"Don Camillo movies were my favourites, when I was a child and as an adult I've found new things to love. Fernandel's is the classic clown's face, strecthing from comical to deeply human, scarred with compassion and sadness. I cannot imagine anyone else to carry Don Camillo's robes, he had the physical appearance and the right kind of personality. It's been odd to see him in different movies since then - but always a pleasure.
Gino Cervi, the mayor Peppone is also great, his physique is stiffer, bulkier, his face is also stiffer - a perfect communist-mechanic, earnest and passionate but slow, Don Camillo's opponent, on the surface thoroughly different but inside very much like him. An explosive pair, that also gets things done in the little town by the river Po, where summers are so hot, that people's brains get heated up from time to time, as Guareschi often says in his books, which are the basis for these movies. There are at least five of them altogether, though Amazon now has only one. In one of them Don Camillo disguises himself as a communist and travels to Soviet Union with Peppone's group. Books can be found on Zshops, get some and have fun.
Movies are based on Guareschi's short stories, so they usually don't have a very consistent story (except the one, where they travel to Soviet Union), but they are very well put together, with a clever narration leading the story. And the action is delicious: from little things action builds up and suddenly the whole town is on the move, everyone fighting everyone and Don Camillo and Peppone in the middle leading their troups and in the quiet moments continuing the argument by themselves. This is the priest, who sounds his church bells, when communists are having speeches on the town square, and who asks Jesus for a permission to hit the communist mayor, who is kneeling down to a prayer in front of him. And when Jesus reminds, that his hands are meant for blessing, he realizes: ""But my feet aren't!"" And with His permission he kicks. And this is the mayor, who wants his baby baptized as Lenin and in the dark of the night attacks the priest and paints his behind red... (read the books!)
I also love the black and white pictures in these movies, they are so 50's and very Italian. And though Orson Welles is wonderful, I almost dropped my stars from five to three. I missed the original narrator's and the actors' voices and the fluent, energetic, passionate, fast Italian, that really creates the feeling of these movies. But I couldn't do it to Fernandel and Cervi, four stars is bad enough. But I'm hoping that Amazon gets more Don Camillo movies - with subtitles! Maybe some day they are finally relesed on DVD's...",1066780800,19,2698,4.6821052631578945

1881759,2,B00009APCM,"An excellent movie.. however the recordind was VERY VERY BAD!. A re-pack dvd, the video was dark, worst quality than the worst youtube low resolution recordings. The outfit that puts  this dvd productions, has no shame...  There is no Artwork on the face of the dvd, no information about the product. The dvd begins, by missing recorded words, like someone began recording seconds after the movie began. To add insult to injury, the dvd arrived late, and was found to be the wrong dvd. After having to send it back, at ""Amazons expense"", the correct dvd arrived 4-days after. Amazon should look into the way this outfit repackage dvd's. As for me, I had better luck looking in ""used small dvd local stores"". This will be my ""last old-dvd purchase"".",1268524800,6,748,4.746153846153846

1881762,4,B00009APCM,The Little World of Don Camillo video was ordered at the request of a very dear friend of mine.. I must admit I had not heard of the film for over 20 years and thought it was out of print.  The Story is both humorous and enlightening.  Don Camillo is a village priest who manages to  misunderstand and be misunderstood at various time by both his Church and his flock.  It is very funny.,1190246400,,387,4.1891891891891895
1881763,5,B00009APCM,"This is a delightful gem of delicate humour. The acting is excellent. It depicts a backstage view of wartime in a small Italian village. Two camps have emerged - the church and its followers, the Communists and its followers. Each group has its strong leaders, who are both friends and rivals. They disagree constantly but their friendship is deeper than politics.",1178409600,3,364,4.983606557377049

7990273,2,B00009APCM,"The fault is mine for not reading the description you provided. I had hoped to see the film I saw in 1954. I don't like dubbed films and, as much as I like Orson Welles, I don't want to hear his description of the action. I will look for an original version in a format I can use with my DVD player..",1459209600,,300,3.8548387096774195

7990276,3,B00009APCM,This item did not come in the case illustrated. The film is as expected.,1425081600,,72,4.214285714285714
7990277,2,B00009APCM,"DVD was packaged in clear plastic case.  The DVD itself had no FBI warning, had not been remastered, no chapters or special features.  The label on the DVD was white with only the title and ""Published By: Mad Phat Enterprises 2009"".  Audio was OK and movie itself is enjoyable.  However the quality of the video was similar to those one buys in collections of old movies and priced under $5.00 for multiple movies.  Clearly not worth the discounted price of $10.00.",1416182400,2,465,4.691358024691358
7990278,5,B00009APCM,Great!  It took me back t when I first saw the film in the '50s and  I enjoyed it as much this time as I did then. Thank you.  Barbara,1412294400,3,134,3.4
7990279,5,B00009APCM,I bought this DVD a long time ago. We loved it as a family. I had seen it in Italy as a little girl and truly enjoyed it seeing it again and see the difference in the way of life since the 1950's. The arguments between the mayor and the priest are irresistible. I passed on to others who has also seen it as kids. They still loved it too.,1377216000,3,338,3.842857142857143
7990280,4,B00009APCM,"Although the DVD fulfilled expectation, the appearance created a bit of unease as it came in  a simple container with a simple DVD and a like simple label. Nothing professional about it and thus made one think it could have been ripped of.",1375142400,3,239,4.558139534883721
