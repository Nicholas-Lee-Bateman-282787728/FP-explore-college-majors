Movies, as they age, will have certain flaws that are a bit worrisome, but the wrinkles in my face are also, yet they come with the territory. These films are no exception, but if you are a history buff, as my lady and myself, they are informative.

Good purchase for us.",1309996800,3,419,4.172839506172839
8285559,4,B000MV8A7M,"This is a collection of a 1963 TV series called ""Battleline.""  Each episode focused on a pair of soldiers on opposite sides of a battle of World War II.  It might be a Polish and a German Officer, or a Japanese and a British Officer.  This is a great series for anyone interested in that war.  The episodes included in this collection are:

DISC ONE:
Fall of Midway
Guadalcanal
Tarawa
Operation Torch
Tobruk
El Alamein

DISC TWO
Stalingrad
Sicily
Ploesti
Monte Cassino
Anzio
Bombing of Germany

Although the packaging doesn't acknowledge the original series, this is a fascinating documentary on World War II.",1209168000,7,609,4.854368932038835
