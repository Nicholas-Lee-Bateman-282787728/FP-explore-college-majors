2550203,2,B000F3HV5E,"Get off the cross Joe!
in his mid 50's when writing his very good  autobiography (which  I  have read) Joe still refused to even refer to Muhammad Ali as anything  other than ""CLAY""...so go from  there when you watch Joe moan about being  called a ""Gorilla"" talk about disprespect...Ali said Clay was his  slave name and took another decades earlier...for Joe to disrespect that and then cry about being called a Tom is truly 2 faced...and I like Joe, love  his work ethic and story...unfortunately that is ALL we  get  in this movie.

The sad thing about being ALI these  days is that he's lost his voice...literally,  and so whether its  the movie ""Facing Ali"" that  is due soon  or this  documentary people involved with his history are speaking  for and about him and he's got no voice  in it. How much of Ali's fight build up chatter throughout his career was to feed the press and make his fights much more known and a  much better pay day...and how many of his comments were serious attacks...we may never know. I've never seen a grown man whine so much about being  called a ""gorilla"" as much as Frazier and his friends  and family do in this documentary.  Joe Frazier should shut his complaining  mouth  and accept  that  without Ali he'd be Larry Holmes. If you visit his website its  adorned with pictures of him and Ali most of  them the ""punch"" that sent  Ali  down in their first fight...and he has multiple versions  of it for sale ,  signed for hundreds  of dollars....without Ali  and the controversy he complains about over and over he'd be a forgotten name in a history book..oh and the pictures of himself signed ..without ALI sell for 3 times LESS...so I guess Joe knows the truth doesn't he?

Make  no mistake...I like Smokin Joe and thought he was a class act before his participation  in this  rewriting  of history. With a bit of editing and a perspective of the documentary film maker  you can present any position you like and I guess they still want to cash in on the magic that is and always will be ""Ali"" but figure making him a racist devil and  as they do a member of an organization similar to the KKK...(they do believe me)...its another way to get money off him.

The idea that Ali is suffering in his life now due to past treatment of Frazier is beyond belief and what does that say about Frazier's own feeling of importance that God would somehow punish another man for calling him a ""tom"" or ""Gorilla""? Ali should have quit after this fight and Frazier should have as well...they both took too many hits to the head and in this fight in far too dehydrated a state with the brain less protected...

The only reason I give it 2 stars is for the extra footage to add to my library.  This is a great example of documentary perspective...and while Ali the saint might be too far in the opposite direction, I'm aware of enough other accounts  and perspectives to appreciate this re-imagining of the past as perhaps  the only new  way to mine the legend..it isn't the first place  I'd go to enjoy this bit of history and certainly not  definitive.",1244332800,12,3078,4.48731884057971
2550204,4,B000F3HV5E,i saw this on HBO and it was awesome so i bought it and there were a couple parts i think they edited out like when one of joe fraizer's corner men was talking about the first ali fraizer fight they cut out a hilarious climactic part. and they took out all the footage from the first fight when joe knocked ali down and replaced it with pictures. that pissed me off.,1244332800,19,366,4.097222222222222
2550205,5,B000F3HV5E,"I caught a bit of this on HBO a couple months ago and wanted to see more.  I got the DVD and - wow - its amazing how much this really takes you back to a different world and time.  I had always been a big Ali fan because he was so good at getting out there and marketing himself but this really put a light on alot of stuff that has been swept under the rug.

Plus the physicality of the whole fight itself - how it went the full rounds and the ending - well you have to see it to know.

Wish there were more extras because Frazier comes off as such a nice guy - a bit bitter but understandably so.  This is a must see ofr anyone - really the boxing is so secondary - am getting a copy for my dad for father's day.",1243987200,11,714,3.7333333333333334

2550211,5,B000F3HV5E,"I saw the fight (but missed the behind the scene, which means I saw nothing).  I thought it was ONE of the memories of my youth.  I talked and even argued about the Fight.  I read the book by Muhammad Ali ""Sting Like A Bee"" several times.  But when I saw 30 for 30 reporting this even...I was stunned when I saw the ""Love Fest"" between the 2 men.
  I can't measure the greatness in the way the behind the scene reporting you gave me Much Respect for those 2 men.  I've watch the tape Over and Over, and still feel like its the first day in school.  Ali and Frazier are still Men amongst Boys.  There are NOW like them today.

2550224,5,B000F3HV5E,"I remember this era very well, I bought the earlier VHS that featured Angelo Dundee and Eddie Futch offering their views.  I enjoyed this one much more since it brought so much to light.  It was a documentary that covered both sides of the story and Joe Frazier was not reduced to something of an extreme secondary figure.  The rivalry and the hyperbole was presented and analyzed now with a perspective not done before.  I was surprised how Ferdie Pacheco came off in this.  He seemed to take umbrage for no apparent reason. Perhaps defensive of his friend, Ali.  I had been used to the erudite color commentator of cable television, I expected something insightful from him.  He was downright dismissive. He came off as just another guy in Ali's camp, time had lent no perspective for him.

A courageous documentary since most films and documentaries featuring Ali, tend to be tributes and never a critique is made.  This documentary makes some salient points, and brings aspect on this rivalry only made on Mark Kram's excellet book ""Ghosts of Manila"", which also made points and critiques that provoked many. So be it.  Not all can be tributes and no one is above critique.

The fight itself was well analyzed.  I had seen this on HBO and wanted to and did purchase it.  I have a number of sport documentaries and this one rates right up there.  The candid interviews.  Marvis Frazier's interviews were quite entertaining,  I especially enjoyed his imitation of Howard Cosell.  The varying opinions and analysis by sports reporters, their analysis and observations.  It was compelling viewing.  It was well done, editing and all.  Well worth the purchase.",1361750400,3,1659,4.857142857142857
2550225,5,B000F3HV5E,I first saw this on HBO and the documentary is tremendously fantastic. One of the greatest boxing match of all time. Hats off to the people who created this documentary.,1361750400,,169,4.666666666666667
2550226,5,B000F3HV5E,This is an outstanding account of one of trhe best boxing bouts in history.  It includes the events leading up to the bout in which Ali showed no respect for Frazier.  This led to a lasting hatred of Frazier towards Ali.  After the fight Ali tried to apologize. but he did so to Frazier's son not to Frazier directly.  Frazier never acceted the apology and remained bitter.  In my view Frazier won the fight by a wisker and Ali wantedto quit after round 14.  Unfortunately Frazier's corner conceded the fight over Frazier's objections.,1361145600,2,535,4.698924731182796
2550227,5,B000F3HV5E,"joe frazier was a true champion but ali was better ali did more for the sport of boxing in his sleep than frazier ever did they were both true great chapions but ali was the one that brought big money to sports for the athletes before him they were fighting for peanuts. race was a factor frazier was the white mans boy, the only thing i have with frazier is he refused to acknowledge his blackness just to stay in good with white people.not to say that i hate all whites but ali was the first to say to his tranier im the boss, not you, this is intelligence he refused to be treated like a farm animal, which is the way most fighters were, and ultimately it was about race. great dvd why didn't they include the entire fight on the special features.",1360800000,,750,4.215277777777778

2550229,5,B000F3HV5E,"There are numerous books and movies which portray these two great boxers from Ali's point of view, but this movie appears to be much more accurate from Smokin Joe's point of view. This great movie was shipped and received faster than expected. Great job!",1342742400,,254,4.795454545454546
2550230,4,B000F3HV5E,"Saw Rumble in the Jungle and this back to back and liked this better probably because it seemed more honest and did a much better job at explaining the stakes involved.  Rumble in the Jungle was great and is a great story but probably glossed over a lot at the expense of showing the symbollic importance of Ali, a black man, fighting in Africa.  That stuff was important but I think that film really failed in exploring the moral shakiness of taking money from a dictator.

Thrilla in Manilla didn't really do that justice either but at least we get more than a movie about glory.  This film is more interesting because it does a better job of showing what was personally at stake for each of these men, because it doesn't blindly subscribe to the Ali myth (which I still think on balance he deserves), and because it the drama of the Frazier-Ali fights is much bigger than the Foreman-Ali fight.

In the Rumble film, Foreman wasn't much better than a prop and Ali beats him with cleverness and Africa is great and there it is.  In Thrilla, Ali is shown as human, quite failable even in his heroism, and we learn more about how his actions hurt himself and Frazier far more than he realized at the time.  This film tries to give everyone their due and succeeds.",1339718400,,1262,4.460869565217391

2550232,4,B000F3HV5E,"Bought this as a gift thinking the main focus would be on the fight with some interviews regarding the fight, etc. To my surprise this actually turned out to be a sad documentary focusing on Joe Frazier. If you're an Ali fan, this documentary will probably change your view of him while watching, because of his emotional affect on Frazier. The bottom line is that no matter how well you like Ali, you can't help but feel sorry for Frazier. Overall, this is a good, emotional documentary. Had the right amount of fight footage and thank goodness some light/funny moments.",1326499200,7,571,4.72
2550233,4,B000F3HV5E,"The stretch of history this intriguing documentary covers gives real punch to the painful story of Muhammed Ali and his rival, Joe Frazier. It was a period of national turmoil and in the case of Messrs. Ali and Frazier a turbulent rivalry that outlasted many of our national disputes. This documentary is painful and very personal. There is punishing footage as well as present day commentary on the private battles of Joe Frazier. The tendency of any filmmaker whose subject screams is rarely to pull back and give us a crisp narrative, but here he succeeds. By so doing, the personalities of both men rise to take center stage. For the viewer, this documentary is one that will not be easily forgotten. For students of documentary studies, it is essential.",1323302400,,758,4.838461538461538
2550234,5,B000F3HV5E,"An outstanding documentary.  This production does not glamorize Muhammad Ali yet, his greatness is undeniable as always.  It tells an important, differently heroic story of Joe Frazier, who was a warrior and a true champion.  Sadly, some of this was difficult to watch because of how candid the interviews are and how deep the rivalry, or hatred is.  Whether you appreciate the Muhammad Ali legacy, the Ali/Frazier rivalry, or a fresh Joe Frazier perspective on the rivalry and the Thrilla In Manilla in particular, or just a great true story in general, add this to your collection.  It is excellent.",1299456000,2,601,4.97
2550235,5,B000F3HV5E,"I was 10 years old when Frazier and Clay first fought.  Most (but not all) of my friends and I quickly became Frazier fans because of Ali's mouth.  He was too flashy and Hollywood and full of himself.  Frazier was blue-collar working-class like us.  All business.  And he could take any punch that Ali gave him.  Not many men could do that.

And this fight...it is without question the greatest sporting event I've ever seen.

This documentary tells the story of their rivalry in a way I've never seen.  It gives all the background leading up to the fight -- and why these guys almost killed each other in Manila.  Some might say this documentary is basically an expose on what a scumbag Cassius Clay is.

I also understand now why Joe Frazier has never forgiven Cassius Clay for all the things he said publicly about Joe back in those days.  It's because Cassius Clay has never been man enough to apologize to Joe's face, man to man.  You don't apologize to a man like Joe Frazier through a newspaper article.  You don't apologize for doing the things Ali did without apologizing in person, face to face, man to man.  I have never liked Ali but this documentary helps me understand exactly why.

Watch this and enjoy.",1294617600,3,1218,4.543778801843318
2550236,5,B000F3HV5E,"Much has been said already about the Thrilla in Manila. Behind the hype and ballyhoo, stood two men who wanted to win at all costs. This documentary enhances the saga of the battle. For boxing fans, this is a must-watch. For Ali and Frazier fans, it is a must-have and collectible.",1257897600,,281,4.529411764705882
2550237,5,B000F3HV5E,"Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest and most important boxer in history, he is the greatest figure in all of sports.  His brazen outspoken politics, his intelligence, his wild sense of humor, a style of fighting so proficient that Bruce Lee drew inspiration from it, and most of all his willingness to go to jail and be stripped of his title and career for his personal beliefs against the Vietnam War. His legendary pre-fight antics were simply the most entertaining thing ever to happen in the world of professional sports. However you choose to look at it, Ali is The Greatest.  In my opinion, the measure of a man and good sportmanship is not what is said and done prior to or even during a competition, but after.  Towards the end of this recent documentary chronicling every angle of the most epic confrontation in the history of boxing, Joe Frazier's brother dials the ex-champ's voicemail for the camera to hear.  Frazier's jovial voice says ""My name is Smokin' Joe Frazier. Sharp as a razor. Yeah. Floating like a butterfly, stings like a bee. I'm the man that done the job. He knows, look and see. Call me. Bye, bye.''  Nearly 35 years after the fact, Frazier is still so defined by that fight and angry at his rival that his recorded cell phone greeting mockingly gloats that he is the reason Muhammad Ali now suffers from advanced Parkinson's Disease.  That is just amazing to me.  Frazier has gone on record many times over the years as saying that Ali has been punished by God for everything from his religious choices (Ali is a Muslim, Frazier a Baptist) to the admittedly brutal and over-the-top insults The Greatest made during their classic rivalry.  As a result, I've long held a strong dislike of Frazier.  But this documentary does an amazing job at summing up the champ's feelings and getting his half of the story out there.  This is the best sports documentary ever made in my opinion and even non-boxing fans will likely be amazed and get the hype about The Thrilla in Manila that continues to this very day when they see it.

Looking at the sum of the events as chronicled in this doc, it's really amazing just how things played out.  This particular telling of the story we've all heard or read in some form or another does a great job telling the humble story of one of the greatest boxers to ever live who has been relegated to being known as ""the guy who fought Ali"" while his poorly-mannered opponent gained immortality, acclaim, and blatant worship around the globe.  While there are plenty of clips of Ali doing his thing here, most of the interviews are from Frazier's family and trainers and his side of the story is fleshed out better the I'd ever seen.  Ali indeed pushed the envelope further with Frazier then he ever had before, utilizing racial insults like Uncle Tom and regularly calling Smokin' Joe a gorilla.  I'll admit to laughing myself sick at the image of Ali clutching a small gorilla doll in one hand while rapidly punching it with the other as a prediction of the fight, but I don't think anybody would say it was a classy thing to do.  The fact that the champ had personally taken Ali under his wing while he was barred from boxing didn't make Ali look too good either.  And what Ali may not have realized was that the power his racial attacks on his opponent and assurances that Frazier worked for ""the enemy"" of black people in that time period led to Frazier's children being beaten up at school for having a perceived race traitor for a father.  Things like that really put into perspective why the fight became so personal.  Ali was a spectacularly funny man, but with the amount of influence he carried at that point in time one does wish he had chosen his words more carefully.  And there are allegations in this doc from both camps that the words were not even Ali's own, but fed to him by the militant segregationist Nation of Islam.  In one shocking moment, Ali recounts a speech he gave IN FRONT OF THE KU KLUX KLAN suggesting cooperation to eliminate interracial breeding.  That really threw me for a loop.  My personal hero throwing in with The Klan?  If you'd told me that, I'd have called you a liar, but there it is.  Forgotten moments like that are what make this documentary so amazing.

Professional boxing may have become stale and dull in recent years, but it's storied history will remain forever enthralling. Seeing Muhammad Ali in action will always be a thing of beauty, and the amazing outcome of a fight so brutal it essentially ended his career as The Greatest because he simply never recovered from the punishment he took over 14 rounds at Frazier's hands will always be talked about.  Ali has recanted several times the statements made about Joe Frazier as having been purely for entertainment, but there is no forgiveness.  Smokin' Joe is as bitter today as he was three decades ago and delights in the notion that his opponent's degenerative suffering could be his handiwork.  You couldn't write a more compelling story then the history between these two all-time greats.  This documentary is the most complete retrospective of what will always be the greatest fight of all time and whether you are a fan of boxing, Joe Frazier, or Muhammad Ali or you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you will have a great time watching this movie.",1250294400,12,5331,4.616525423728813
2550238,4,B000F3HV5E,"Finally, if the world really wants to know, Muhammad Ali is exposed. It was nice to learn that Joe Frazier gave Ali money to get by on when he was barred from boxing for refusing to be drafted during the Viet Nam war era. As a dedicated fan of boxing, I had never heard that before. Then, upon reinstatement Ali turned on Joe. Frazier is shown as a wonderful person with quite limited communication skills. Nontheless, we again feel for him during all the years that Ali continued to intimidate and belittle Joe. It was uncalled for. If, as Ali claims, it was all about hyping a fight, their three bouts needed no hyperbole. Joe has walked off into the sunset with his integrity. Ali, as Joe says, today is paying the price we all must pay if we tear another down to build ourself up. It is a perfectly done DVD and a keeper in the sports library. Dr. Ferdy Pacheco's role in all of it provides fair balance. There is a golden thread of truth throughout the sports documentary making a viewer want to see it again and again.",1250208000,2,1024,4.366492146596858
