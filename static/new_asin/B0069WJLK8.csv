4981032,5,B0069WJLK8,Where do you begin when a movie touches your entire being -- heart and soul.  10 Mountains 10 Years is an amazing documentary.  It's touching and the stories contained within will each touch you in their own way.  I was able to see this movie when it premeired in the theatre in Boston and it was amazing to watch on the big screen... it was equally as amazing to see it on my TV screen.  There is so much love and togetherness in this movie.  Each person from different areas of life come together for one common cause... to raise awareness and funds for Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease.  This is a one of a kind movie.  If you think one person can't make a difference... this proves that with one persons idea many can follow and spread the word... raise awareness... raise funds.  To all those who were in this movie a personal thank you from me to you for all you do day in and day out to help raise awareness and funds for PD and Alzheimer's.  Each story touched me personally and deeply.  Together we can do anything...there are no boundaries.  Together is ONE!  World Up!,1322524800,3,1090,4.422110552763819

This is a must see for anyone who has dreamed about doing something but hasn't because they thought it would be too difficult or they were told their idea was unattainable. This movie will change the way to think. Five stars easily. Adam, Mahopac NY",1322524800,,409,4.694444444444445

8495567,5,B0069WJLK8,"This movie is about an ongoing effort for an explorer (Enzo Simone) to raise awareness to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.  Real life stories about the struggles people with these diseases face...The explorer, Enzo Simone creates a symbolic ongoing adventure to climb 10 mountains in 10 years after his mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and his Father-in-Law has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease....very touching as he realizes unless he finds a cure for these diseases...he too could be afflicted...and the debilitating consequences would deprive him of the simple pleasures in life...such as sharing stories with his grandchildren....

Absolutely tear jerking...to watch these people with their struggles as they try their very best and their only hope is just to survive.

I expect to see additional documentaries on this as Enzo Simone completes his 10 Mountains in 10 Years expeditions...totally looking forward to seeing sequels to this documentary.",1349222400,,975,5.619047619047619

They are on a journey to climb 10 mountains in 10 years in order to raise funds and awareness to find a cure for both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.

This film focuses on their climb of Kilamanjaro, but the symbolism of the climb to the summit is just the beginning. Many of the group were not mountain climbers before this trip and you can feel how stepping outside their comfort zones has transformed their lives.

If you want to watch a movie about how the human spirit in a small group working towards a common goal can indeed begin to make a difference, then this movie is for you!",1342137600,,726,4.534351145038168
