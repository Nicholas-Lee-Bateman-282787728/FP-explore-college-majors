""Surf Ninjas,"" ""Gold Medal Garu,"" and ""Autograph This"" are classics.",1324425600,,509,5.035714285714286
3690791,4,B001LRL4X8,"Enjoyed the show -- wished there were more DVDs in the series.  When this was broadcast on Disney, there were many more episodes I would have loved to have copies of but cannot.  Oh well, I guess I'll just have to watch these and enjoy what I can get.",1323734400,,251,4.1020408163265305
3690792,4,B001LRL4X8,"I love Pucca! She's so cute, and boy can she fight. Even though she doesn't talk, you know what she wants. I especially love when she chases and outsmarts Garu. He thinks he's so smart.
I'll always be a fan of Pucca; she cheered me up after my father's death. She made me laugh when I needed to.",1310256000,,295,4.103448275862069

3690794,5,B001LRL4X8,"I bought this dvd for my friend, and she was over the moon. At first I had no idea who or what Pucca Funny Love was, then my friend pursuaded me to buy this and although I thought it was kinda weird at first I slowly grew to love it just as much as she did!
It's funny, cute, and to be honest quite original too. If you're going out on a splurge, and you want something different and suitable for everyone then you should try this.",1254960000,,431,3.9655172413793105

3690799,5,B001LRL4X8,"My 5 year old daughter loves all the Pucca seasons.  We originally watched on Netflix but it's not available there anymore.  Happy it's available on Prime.  Although the show is ridiculous, my daughter relates to Pucca in that she loves a boy who could care less about giving her any attention; however, Pucca does not let anyone push her over or hurt those she cares about- She stands up for herself.  Is it possibly too violent for a 4 or 5 year old, yes; but for our family, our daughter has a good grasp of what is and isn't reality and we watch it with her.  I would rather her watch this than Bratz.",1391040000,,605,4.271929824561403
