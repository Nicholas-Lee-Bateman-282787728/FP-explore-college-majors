8440393,2,B004T1RAUE,"Although selected by search function and listed as ""adult"" this has no sexual activity or nudity. The girls do not interact. Although each is shown in the shower, they are dressed while showering. Although the girls are playful, smiling and somewhat good looking, I came away bored.",1454716800,,282,5.0212765957446805

8440396,5,B004T1RAUE,"First of all this DVD isn't hard core at all. It's more of a sensual erotic DVD. The girls are never together in the same scenes so they don't get to kiss and lick each other or anything like that. They each have their own scenes alone alternating turns after each scene. There are 16 scenes totaling 1 hour 17 minutes and 52 seconds. Some scenes are continuations of another scene. The girls on the cover are the actual girls on the DVD video. Risa is the more pleasantly plump one and Naomi is the skinny girl. The DVD case has all kinds of Japanese character writing on the back but these girls don't look Japanese to me but I guess they are according to the description. They look more like Filipino or Thailand sort of girls. There is no talking on this DVD,  just smooth island music with sensual poses in bikinis and swimsuits with occasional caressing of their body but not really direct hardcore caressing but more slow all over body tickling with occasional lift up swimsuit crotch and top with not much exposure. just some pubic hair and some nip here and there. There are some nip slips and lip slips but nothing graphic or hardcore for a long period of time. You get to see what their mammaries look like, its just not upforward and fast. The girls usually have a bikini with thong or swimsuit in each scene. So to me it's a pretty good DVD, good picture, nice exotic beach locations and girls that look more next door or you go to school with them look and not sports illustrated perfect body models. If you are looking for hardcore licking, kissing, pounding, graphic nudity then this DVD won't cut it. It's more of a warm up erotic sexy video. The scene index has two sides. Naomi side and Risa side.

NAOMI SIDE  RISA SIDE

(Japanese title).  Green Bikini
Boat Dancing.  (Japanese title)
Eat You Banana.  Flower Bikini
Shower Play.  Super Relax
Fire.  Play and shower

All these scenes are on one side of the disc and you don't have to flip or turn DVD when loading. You can select all play also. The shower scenes are nice. Naomi showers in a white see thru spaghetti strap top and white panty bottom and when she wets herself you can see thru clear as day. Risa has a shower scene with that dark blue swimsuit you see on the cover. It clings to her body and you can see her nip lumps and she rubs her breasts soaping them up underneath her suit. She never exposes boobs in that scene. In scene 9 flower bikini Risa is in a tree and exposes her breasts then right at 37 min 7 seconds she grabs her left boob and tucks it in the branch that she's laying on then you see a piece of bark fall off but it looks like a bug trying to run away from being smashed by her big left boob. I think its the tree bark but. So this DVD isn't that bad if you know what your expecting and not expecting heavy girl on girl action with dildos, fisting, licking and passionate rubbing in the gine area. Just sensual erotic scenes accompanied to island music and the sound of native drums in the distance.

8440397,3,B004T1RAUE,"I've seen several of these Vivid Interactive releases from the late 1990s, and if you've seen one,  you've pretty much seen them all: Women who were hot for their time (but not as much in our own--lots and lots of bad breast implants and flat butts) fully-nude but not all that alluring; curiously no explicit nudity from a hard-core company; absurd slow motion used primarily to drag out scenes to thrice their true length; bad production values all the way around; shoddy (and perplexing) editing that will leave you wondering if you're still watching the opening credits or if the presentation has begun in earnest.

That pretty much describes this...and as many companies were doing during this dawn of the DVD age, lots and lots of extra features, many of which aren't worth much: Goofy first-person menu walk-throughs; obligatory photo albums; interactive DVD-ROM features that, if they ever worked, don't appear to work today, 15 years later. There are good extras, though: Lots and lots of previews of other releases that don't scrimp on the details; good behind-the-scenes work. Odd on this particular release that the extra features appear to be for a different DVD. For instance there is a fairly lengthy behind-the-scenes feature about some women who are competing in a stripper contest.

Overall, I can't really recommend this unless you're really really bored and are dying to see some pubic hair, which was one of the only good things about this particular era in nude modeling: Yes, it was at the apex of the implant craze, but no, the fully-shaved craze hadn't hit yet.",1365292800,,1586,4.954887218045113
8440398,1,B004T1RAUE,"The cover photo on the DVD case is completely misleading. You will not see anything like this on the video itself. The entire video consists of a variety of girls just standing around, usually at the beach or in the shower. Sometimes they dance a little. Everything is set to music. But the girls always have on bikinis or bathing suits and they never show anything. The video has no dialogue and no plot. Just girls standing around. And the girls are featured one at a time, so there is no interaction between any of them. If you want to see something that is arousing and entertaining, you would be much better off getting a ""Girls Gone Wild"" DVD. As my title says, this DVD is uninteresting and boring. Not recommended. And definitely not worth the price you'll pay.",1334275200,25,769,4.539568345323741
