1193374,3,B000006GF6,"It gets three stars for (mostly) the car chases and the quality of menace that O'Neal manages to put into the two unaccented words ""Go Home"".
You know you're in for someone's ego-trip attempt at The Great American Existentialist Film when the characters have no names, just labels -- ""The Driver"", ""The Player"", ""The Cop"", etc.
It becomes more obvious when every other bit of dialog is a dry, ""clever"" bit of cynicism.
And it's right there in your face when the major plot revelation in the film is that people don't always do what they ""always do"".
It's far from awful -- Hill is a decent if overrated writer/director.  I mean, he's working the same vein as Leone, Peckinpah and Siegel, just not in as rich a part of the ore.
Well worth seeing for the transitory fun of the story and the incredible driving sequences  -- comparable to the original ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" or ""Vanishing Point"" and superior to, say ""Bullitt"".  But most people i've known who have kept the tape, kept it they can watch that Mercedes in the garage, the chase inside the warehouse or the other driving sequences, not to revel in the story.",989625600,10,1116,4.57
1193375,4,B000006GF6,"This is a true piece of american noir.  It seems like a diverting little car chase movie the first time you see it, but O'Neil's stoic, nihilistic getaway driver has a way of bringing you back for more viewings.  It's interesting that Ian Muldoon mentions the similarity to a Jean-Pierre Melville film in his review, because I think this movie owes a lot to Melville's LE SAMOURAI (on which John Woo's THE KILLER was also based).  Just like Melville's hit man Jeff kills without conscience or reflection, yet still abides by an unbending code of honor, O'Neil's Driver is, ironically, more moral in his way than the obsessed, power-mad cop (Bruce Dern) who pursues him.
Walter Hill no frills, straight-to-the-gut style really works here.  The costumes, sets, and cinematography are dark, understated, and really engrossing, especially on repeated viewings.  I believe that this is a movie that grad-school film students will be watching 100 years from now.",979689600,9,956,5.063694267515924
1193376,5,B000006GF6,Amazing-and to this day a film that is not loved as much as it should be.  Ryan O'Neal is great as the driver-a nearly silent Hawksian professional  getaway driver. Bruce Dern is also good as a cop bent on catching this  outlaw. Lots of western parallels. Great scene wherein O'Neal is asked to  demonstrate his driving skill and he destroys the car that his fellow  crooks have brought. Lots of great car chases-some of the best ever. Walter  Hill really does a heck of a great job here(like he has before). A great  film that deserves the cult following it has-it even deserved more-well  worth owning.,969148800,16,604,4.632075471698113
1193377,5,B000006GF6,"This film makes GONE IN 60 SECONDS seem like a movie for 8 year olds. Although sold as a ""car chase movie"" there is a lot more to this  film than that especially its tight plot, taut direction, mis en scene, and  fun. It's a thriller whose cross and double cross shenanigans are a pure  delight and recall the best of the likes of Howard Hawks in the film noir  forties. It rivals Jean-Pierre Melville and if Walter Hill's name was  Jean-Pierre Hill from Paris it would be thought of as a classic. Hill's  crime is that he's American. Culturally snobbery at work again I believe.  Forget the cars for a minute, dear viewer, and let's consider the four main  actors and what they do. Ryan O'Neal plays incommunicative, lonely, cold,  precise, and good to look at perfectly. Isabelle Adjani plays  incommunicative, lonely, cold, precise and good to look at perfectly. Which  leaves the screen to one of cinema's greatest actors - Bruce Dern - to  really go for it. And go for it he does. He is at his brilliant,  scene-stealing, word chewing best,  and is frankly rivetting and incredible  fun to watch. With O'Neal and Adjani walking through po-faced throughout,  Dern has a field day and is very ably helped by his cop buddy Ronee Blakly.  To top the movie off, there are some of the best car chase sequences on  film, as good as BULLITT. This in my view is WALTER HILL's masterpiece (he  also wrote the screenplay for SAM PECKINPAH's GETAWAY in 1972). It is  absolutely horrifying to me to see that Video Hound's Golden Movie  Retriever 2000 give this film one and half bones which makes me nervous  about many of their other reviews. I've seen this film about 15 times. It  holds up. Don't deny it to yourself if you love cinema.",966816000,54,1731,4.548701298701299

His talents are enlisted by some nasty characters while he is under the watchful eye of  local law enforcement.  There are some nifty car chases/scenes and a lot of  double-crossing going on as we watch and wonder if Ryan is up to the  challange and can get away.  While the basic plot of this film isn't  exactly original (it's devivative of many films of the era), I found it  highly entertaining.  Between 1 and 10, ""The Driver"" gets a solid 7.

1193391,4,B000006GF6,"THE DRIVER 20TH CENTURY FS / WS R1 U.S.A. RELEASE DVD --- QUITE SIMPLY PUT --- A GREAT MOVIE / FILM.  -- Walter Hill ( ""Hard Times"", ""Johnny Handsome"" etc. etc. hits another one out of the park. --- Along with Bullet this is the ultimate car chase flick for many reasons. -- A. It's so much more than a car chase flick.  This is much more on the level of Bullet, The French Connection or Ronin as far as being MORE than OR Not JUST a CAR CHASE MOVIE while really being the absolute definition OF a Car Chase Movie.  This is super rare in this genre & puts The Driver at the top of it's genre & sub genres as well. -- The Driver is the thinking man's car chase movie with many unique attributes. -- The driver not only has style but it has substance. --- It's the complete opposite of The Vanishing Point. -- I never understood the gushing school girl enthusiasm for ""The vanishing Point"".  Don't get me wrong I LOVE MUSCLE CARS & have had many ( 64 GTO, 67 Camaro, 67 Chevelle, 68 Firebird etc. etc. but when I watch a movie I need more than the sweet rumble of that V8 and sound of scratch being laid. -- V.P is just a cheesy, clumsy, disjointed movie with a muscle car being put in 1 contrived situation after another. -- ""The driver"" is completely different.--  Its got it all.- Great writing, directing, acting, plot & character development, AND YES GREAT CAR CHASES & DISPLAYS OF HIGH LEVEL DRIVING SKILLS. The whole Persona of the lead character (""Driver"" ) as the Arch Enemy of the Cop wherein they are constantly playing cat & mouse & one upping games with each other.-- Bruce Dern was perfectly cast for this role (Only Bruce Dern or Gene Hackman would have been perfect to play the cop in this flick). - The aura of mystery & projection of cool by ""The Driver"" etc. just puts this flick on the top shelf of quality & allure. -- & Ryan O'neil (whooda thunkit) was glove fit perfect cast to play ""Driver"". & Boy does he deliver. -- This  movie is filmed extremely economically with not a waste of space in its moving the viewer through the experience. --- Notice the little touches like the early scene where Cop Bruce Dern is shooting pool & the 13 Ball comes up.... Is this a prophetic indication of the misfortune of someones character ? ....While I have a great many good flicks in my collection ""The Driver"" is one of my favorites.-- The picture quality of this release is far from great but respectable as far as I'm concerned. -- & while not at Hi Def quality level neither is it's price.-- With the film stock used to shoot this flick the picture quality will NEVER become great. -- This dvd release comes to us as a ""Flipper"" disc with Full screen on one side & fortunately for us anamorphic widescreen on the flip side. --  I would have liked to see some special features such as Director,Cast commentaries & maybe a making of featurette but sometimes we can't have everything. --- In conclusion --- 5 stars for the movie itself --- Minus a star for the 20th Century Fox Dvd release of the Driver. ---Hope this info helps you out",1489881600,,3047,4.35387323943662

1193412,5,B000006GF6,"This 1978 film is sufficiently old as to be considered almost an historic. Essentially it is a low dialogue concentrated action movie based on a cop versus getaway driver. The driving sequences are the star turn of the movie and feature some of the best ever filmed and what is a regular feature in most cops and robbers films. Otherwise it is a story of two leads trying to outwit each other.

The detective is portrayed in such a manner as to make viewers see him in a much compromised light. The driver, on the other hand, comes out as something approaching a hero status. This is established by juxtaposing Ryan O'Neal, the driver, against the unattractive nature of both the detective and a set of fundamentally violent criminals engaged by the detective to lure and trap O'Neal is his role. The film plays for just under 90 minutes which keeps the tension high and militates against padding of the script or plot line. Interestingly, violence is kept to an absolute minimum and is never gratuitous. Intrigued readers will have to buy the film to find out what happens!

However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film and who have bought the previous DVD version of this disc, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

This well-preserved 1978 cat and mouse thriller offers significantly enhanced sound and vision on the BD format",1474329600,,3099,5.0136186770428015

1193482,4,B000006GF6,"Ryan O'Neal (none of the lead characters have names - they are The Driver, The Detective, etc.) waits in his car behind a casino. Isabelle Adjani (who plays the entire film like a porcelain-faced android with a Bernadette Peters pout) has collected her winnings, and clearly sees O'Neal's face as two men in hockey masks exit the casino with the cash they've stolen. He doesn't so much evade the police as demolish the four pursuing cars, principally by driving straight at them in confined spaces, like a man indifferent to the prospect of his own death, until they lose their nerve and drive into walls. O'Neal is quickly picked up by cop Dern and placed before eyewitnesses, but Adjani refuses to name him. (In a film which sits between homage to and wholesale robbery from the works of Jean-Pierre Melville, this scene is lifted from Le Samourai.)

Dern, an arrogant man whom even his colleagues don't like, is so determined to catch the driver that he allows another criminal to go free if he'll recruit O'Neal to drive in his next job. O'Neal refuses that offer at first, after demonstrating his driving skills in an impressive (but again borrowed, this time from Point Blank) scene in which he thrashes the gang's bright orange Mercedes around an underground car park at alarming speed until he has wrecked every panel. O'Neal further antagonises the gang's trigger-happy second-in-command, so now he has an obsessed cop and a homicidal criminal pursuing him.

After his next getaway, O'Neal has a bag of traceable money that he has to have laundered at an extortionate rate. Adjani offers to help exchange satchels with the money man in lockers at a railway station, observed the whole time by police. Dern pursues the money man on a train (these scenes reference Melville's Le Cercle Rouge). O'Neal faces off against the criminal in a warehouse, culminating in a car stunt as impressive as any I've ever seen, and then, despite his stated disregard for money, decides to return to the railway station locker.

The spareness of Walter Hill's film is distancing. The primary effect is reducing it to a treatise on film history, taking specific scenes (O'Neal fully clothed on his bed in the one suit he constantly wears, in his spartan hotel room), but also the arid tone of late Melville. O'Neal disdains not only money (he talks about mailing the cash to Dern, which robs his returning for it at the end of motivation, unless, as his driving hints, he really is suicidal) and romance (a scene from the trailer with him and Adjani in a clinch is rigorously edited out of the final film), but also quite possibly food and oxygen. Adjani's frozen face becomes progressively more perplexing, and eventually slightly comical, which I'm not sure was the intended effect.

Apart from the leads, other character get to behave like humans rather than archetypes. Dern's performance is singular - I can't remember a movie cop like him - and appealingly eccentric. Ronee Blakely (who seemed like a big '70s name, but IMDb doesn't confirm this - she was the mom in the first Nightmare on Elm Street, though) is warm in her few scenes as The Connection, more or less O'Neal's booking agent.

A Michigan woman famously sued the distributor of Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive for misleading advertising, having concluded from the trailers that it might resemble The Fast and the Furious. It speaks to Walter HIll's generosity and good character that he didn't launch his own suit, since Ryan Gosling's character and performance in that film so specifically resemble O'Neal's here.

Despite all the above, what The Driver does get right is the driving. Even discounting my nostalgic readiness to be disproportionately impressed by actual stunts rather than CGI, the lengthy car chases are thrillingly staged. O'Neal isn't granted superhuman powers - he can't always do things that the pursuing police can't, but eventually defeats them because he never loses his nerve. The scene from Ronin in which a car chase heads into the flow of one-way traffic might have been taken from this film, where it's equally effective. The climactic confrontation in the warehouse made my jaw drop - I'm still not sure how they filmed something so destructive without someone on set being killed.

The Driver isn't a lost classic, but it's efficient, cine-literate, and (I mean this without condescension, since it's a group to which I belong) worth seeing for enthusiasts of vintage car-chases.",1386115200,3,4469,4.942743009320905

1193485,5,B000006GF6,"Forget all recent pretenders, The Driver is THE great getaway drive and Walter Hill's best movie by far. It's a simple story about a duel of nerves as much as wits where the loot is irrelevant and the challenge is everything, played out by iconic characters known only by their jobs - cop, driver, player. Ryan O'Neal is the best getaway driver in the business who's never been caught, locking antlers with Bruce Dern's obsessive cop who is more than willing to break the law to take him down, even setting up a robbery so he can catch him with the loot. Along the way there are a few twists and turns, a couple of cold-blooded shocks and three of the most remarkable - yet never ludicrously over the top - car chases ever filmed. It's not always entirely realistic, but its nocturnal world of reflective surfaces, flexible morals and inflexible professional ethics creates its own believable world that draws you in and never lets you go.

Hill had been an assistant director on Bullitt, and even cast that film's mute witness Felice Orlandi as one of the cops, but there's a lot more to the film than just great car chases or an effortlessly cool atmosphere. His direction is immaculate, visually imaginative but controlled and contained, never showing off: like his characters, it's about doing the job better than anyone else without breaking a sweat. Pared to the bone, it's a classic example of show, don't tell, which makes it all the more surprising to find an alternate opening on Twilight Time's limited edition Blu-ray that spells out things in very black and white terms. It was a wise move cutting it in favor of the much more visually striking, almost silent opening robbery and getaway, because we don't need to see witness Isabelle Adjani being paid in advance for her silence or to see Matt Clark's reluctant sidekick being introduced to new boss Dern to sense the tension between them (ironically in a scene where Dern tells him ""Don't talk. When you're talking, you're not thinking""). Everything we need to know, we find out naturally.

These characters don't need fleshing out: hollow, lonely inhabitants of a hollow, lonely city defined purely by their professions, all they have are the games they play. The stakes may not be even - if the Driver wins, he makes a little money. If the cop wins, the Driver goes to jail for 15 years - but the players are evenly matched, each the best at what they do and each eager to prove it by outwitting the other. Not that there aren't amateurs and also-rans circling them, not least a pair of convincingly seedy low-lives well worth steering clear of in Joseph Walsh's Glasses and Rudy Ramos' Teeth.

It's rather hard to take seriously Hill's claims that he hadn't seen Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai when he made it too seriously - not only does a woman provide the driver with an alibi but Hill even makes her a Frenchwoman (Adjani, the film's sole the weak link, playing her part with the kind of inexpressiveness that starts to turn into a death mask). But there's equal influence from the earlier Hill-scripted Peckinpah version of The Getaway in its train sequence with a suitcase full of cash and the scene where O'Neal demolishes a car with a display of precision driving in a car park with the same kind of ruthless efficiency that Steve McQueen (for whom this was originally written) destroyed a cop car with a shotgun. True the car chases that looked so extraordinary with their mixture of POV shots and old school stunt driving on the giant screen lose a little bit of their impact on the small screen, particularly if you've only seen it fullscreen, but the widescreen Blu-ray release at times comes pretty close, although unusually for one of Twilight Time's titles I found myself having to adjust my TV's default picture settings to get the optimum picture quality in the opening night time sequences.

Although the film received rave reviews and did decent business in Europe (it was largely financed by British company EMI), it met with a muted critical and box-office reception in the US, where O'Neal's reputation as a lightweight pretty boy romantic comedy star worked against it. That seems particularly unfair, because O'Neal turns in a career-best performance here and just oozes the right kind of dangerous cool for the part. He's well matched by Bruce Dern in a role that seems so perfectly tailored to his brand of dangerous nervous energy, here kept leashed behind an almost permanent grin, that it's surprising to learn it was originally intended for Robert Mitchum, who turned it down because he thought there was ""too much car stuff.""

There have long been rumors of a much longer 131-minute cut including more action, a lot more character development and a prominent supporting role for Cheryl Ladd, all of which hit the cutting room floor after a solitary preview screening, but Hill has categorically confirmed that it's pure urban legend and that the 89-minute version is his definitive version. It's hard to believe anyone could see a longer, talkier version as an improvement: pared down to a tight hour-and-a-half and with its characters kept firmly iconic, this is such a perfect movie it doesn't need embellishment.

Twilight Time's limited edition Blu-ray comes with deleted alternate opening, trailer, an isolated track for Michael Small's score and booklet with informed commentary by Julie Kirgo.",1381449600,7,5404,4.855748373101952

1193491,4,B000006GF6,"The Driver (1978) is a dark atmospheric crime thriller, where there isn't a great deal of clarity or depth, as most of the characters don't even have proper names.

Directed by Walter Hill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B004RE29PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Fire/dp/0783227876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Fire</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Southern-Comfort/dp/B000059TGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Southern Comfort</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prometheus/dp/B005LAIHY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prometheus</a>), the high points of the film are a number of intense and complicated car chase sequences.

After a robbery goes bad, a gang of criminals barely manages to escape capture, only because the Driver manages to elude a number of pursing police cars, by executing a series of daring maneuvers, in the streets and alleys of Los Angeles.  Determined to arrest the Driver, the Detective (Bruce Dern) in charge of the investigation, sets a trap to involve him in a scheme to rob a bank.  With veteran criminals involved, the level of intrigue and deception rises, as a small fortune is at stake.

After some intense moments and an inspired vehicular chase scene, the conclusion is a bit disappointing, but the movie is still an entertaining adventure, that isn't meant to be scrutinized too closely.  Ryan O'Neal doesn't say much, but is easy to get behind, even if his character is motivated by greed, and is prepared to kill for the cash.

Isabelle Adjani and Ronee Blakely, play associates of the Driver, who each get more than they bargained for, adding some color and interest, to what is mostly an all male affair.

The film's ultimate appeal lies in the spectacular driving sequences.  And here, the passage of time really helped the film.  Cars were different back then, more muscular.  American cars still ruled the world.  Try to visualize a chase with O'Neal driving a Prius--or a Hyundai.  Not quite the same, is it?

One violent scene struck me as over the top, at the time, where a petty criminal exacts revenge on a third party.  This scene pales by comparison to the violence in the recent ""Drive,"" with another Ryan, Gosling.  ""Drive"" has received rave reviews.

Ronee Blakely wants to smile and be happy which is definitely out of place here. Isabelle Adjani's character (or maybe her acting) is one-dimensional.

1193547,4,B000006GF6,"The Driver (1978), is a movie that's controversial, in that
it tends to idolize and glorify the ""driver"" who participates
in heists, hold ups, and stick ups. This is supported not
only by the protagonist, Ryan O'Neal, being a phenomenal
driver of various consumer cars (pickups, Mercedez Benz,
regular American cars) but also sparing the life of his
rivals driver, as well, with the argument that the latter
was  ""only a driver"", in setup to doom him.

In between the above element of glorifying the criminal element,
(money laundering, gambling, etc) and suggesting in a candid way that
some peace officers are rogue, and act in a similar way to Dirty Harry,
for example, compromising their means, in order to achieve a desired
end for purposes of career promotion, notoriety, prestige as a detective
team leade, there's plenty of time to show off hair-raising stunts set
in the downtown or metro area of a major huge city, the size
of Chicago, NYC or New Jersey, for example, with suspense,  and
style to an eager audience.

As stated, the car chases are spectacular in this movie (although
not as much as seen in the Seven Ups, with Roy Scheider elsewhere.)

In addition, the main actors are charismatic and low brow, modest
with a powerful, underlying vitality, energy and sensitivity,
in the form of O'Neal and also, Isabelle Adjani - the latter, who
projects here an image of youth, baby-faced innocence, and self-confidence
all the while being sensitive, and down to earth, that many in the audience
will build a rapport with.

Next, the earlier stylish and fascinating elements, are juxtaposed with
some point-blank shootings in the course of the action, coupled with
pistol and shotgun scenes during high speed car chases.

Various scenarios are shown of hold-ups, such as that of a supermarket,
a bank, and more ...with commentary that is somewhat politically
incorrect 30 years later, such as the cop calling another a ""fruiter""
or bribe taker, etc.

The lead detective's cockiness (Bruce Dern) is shown by comparing gun violence
and car chases in the middle of where the public at large is walking
 and driving to the sports pages of a newspaper. The same officer's
dialog is also surreal, from the concern he shows to the suspect,
by discussing his personal and professional life, as some kinds of
counsellor, when that's is not entirely realistic.

The rates for a hotel room ($5 and $1 for a TV) indicate the inflation
rate, that the economy has gone through, since that time.",1228435200,3,2491,4.895486935866983

Just because Bruce Dern has these terrible lines like ""Cowboy, Desperado"" that he [aims] at Ryan O'Neal, ""The Driver"" - who is hired out by bad guys for getaways from crime scenes (guess that goes without saying).

The plot was really far-fetched. I mean a cop making a deal with bad guys (three real bumbling clowns) to rob a bank so that he can catch ""Driver"" - Ryan O'Neal. But darn it, the hokey lines that Bruce Dern exchanges with one of his ""understudy's"" (Matt Clark) and O'Neal are really outrageous.

I must add that the car chases were NOT that great. Really. Nothing can compare to ""Bullitt.""  Even ""The Seven-Ups"" car chase was better than the ones in this movie.

Again, I must say that only for the acting of Bruce Dern, this movie would fall flat on its face. Isabelle Adjani really brings home some dead-pan acting. Absolutely emotionless. And Ryan O'Neal's acting isn't much more emotional, either. But all this adds up to a really cool movie. Why? I still don't know.",1219363200,4,1062,4.573684210526316

The Detective knows who The Driver is. He just can't get anything on him. Frustrated, he tries spilling hot coffee on his quarry in an attempt to provoke him. When that doesn't work, The Detective devises a more sophisticated plan: He pressures a hold-up man into setting The Driver up in a bank heist job.

Characters in ""The Driver"" don't have names. At least not that we know of. This self-consciously hip 1978 neo-noir written and directed by Walter Hill is an exercise in ""cool"". Dialogue is sparse, conversations unnatural, and driving is fetishized. There are two 6-minute car chases. Not to mention the systematic dismemberment of an orange Mercedes by means of a parking garage. The budget must have been small, as there are no changes of wardrobe. But ""The Driver"" is entertaining, nicely paced, and ""noir"" in its outlook. The Driver is a handsome, laconic anti-hero who seems more honorable than the lawman who pursues him. The Detective is a cocksure egomaniac concerned more with the thrill of the ""game"" than with the law. But there is no honor among thieves or among cops here.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): This is a 2-sided disc with a full screen version on Side A and widescreen version on the flipside. The only bonus feature is an ""Alternate Beginning"", in which The Connection explains to The Player (Adjani) her role in the casino heist, and The Detective's dissenting colleague is introduced as the ""new man"", to whom the Detective takes an immediate dislike. This is unnecessary exposition that did not make the final cut. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.",1177891200,3,1941,5.043613707165109

And then there are some 3rd rate thugs who are supposed to help Detective get Driver arrested - one set of scenes I found personally very touching, involved Los Angeles' Union Station (train station) and an actual train sequence (with the train leaving the station, a search on the train) - was reminiscent of one of my all-time favorite films, The Silver Streak, which came out 2 yrs. before this movie - perhaps the director doffing his cap to that feature...(?)... --- in any case, I highly recommend this feature - offers inner and outer tension (ie, psychological and visible, such as the indeed well choreographed car chase scenes) - Long Live the Year 1978...

Then enters a dirty detective(Bruce Dern),bearing a grudge. Into this mix is the wheel man, like a gunslinger, who just wants a shot at love and wants to put it all behind him. From the first spin in his car, Ryan O'Neal, shows his stuff. There's hardly a clean, honest, upright person in this film which puts you on edge even when you aren't admiring the action. Bruce Dern hounds O'Neal demonically, so that you root for O'Neal and there's always the possibilty of a double-cross. Ryan O'Neal had every reason to pick up where Steve McQueen checked out, but I guess he really had it bad for dames. Some day there will be a Ryan O'Neal collection of ovelooked movies that prove how good he was, if only some studio head cared. This is one of the gems.

1193569,4,B000006GF6,"There is no baloney in this surprisingly good movie (it's not well-known). It also the sports a real oddity: no one's name is mentioned in the entire film! Try to think of any other film you've ever seen where this is the case.

Why 'The Driver"" is not better known is a mystery since the director (Walter Hill) and main actors (Ryan O'Neal and Bruce Dern) are known entities.

Maybe because Ryan, who people think of more as the likable male in the immensely popular ""Love Story"" plays against type, playing an ultra-serious criminal. Make no mistake: he does it well. He is a man of few words in this movie and he handles that in a fascinating manner. Dern is always interesting. Isabelle Adjani, more famous as a French actress, is nice to ogle and she, too, doesn't say much in this film.

The rest of the characters in this modern-day film noir (""neo noir"") are a bunch of low-lifes.  If you like film noir and particularly if you like car-chase scenes, well, this movie is must-have, because there are several intense chase scenes in here and they are long. They're also well-photographed, fun to watch and certainly keep your attention.

Nice to see this movie released on widescreen DVD.  The transfer isn't that sharp, though, but it's inexpensive and worth the money.",1146268800,13,1277,4.678571428571429
1193580,3,B000006GF6,"This film has not been available on video for some time so I was glad to see it's release earlier this year. I'm a big Walter Hill fan and needed to view this to cap off his directing history. Much of what I'd read concerning this movie noted it as being rather cold and hard. More machine and less character. I can't say that I'd argue the point. As a sophmore effort it is a bit (just a bit) of slump from his earlier ""Hard Times."" The approach in story and feel of the production are quite similar to his earlier effort as are the deliberate structure and pacing. But this is a bit more stiff than ""Hard Times."" The dialogue is more stilted and though others rave about Bruce Dern's performance, I found it lacking due to the dialogue he is burdened with. Everything just falls a bit short of where it needs to be.

The glaring exception would be the car chases. they are staged and executed extremely well. And to Hill's credit, he doesn't kill you with them. Each chase is the right length for its spot in the story. I've had my fill of ""B"" movies where the car chases feel as though they comprise 50% of the running time.

I enjoyed watching this movie. It's not bad, but, where I could and have sat through more than one viewing of ""Hard Times"" and Hills next effort, (the nearly flawless ""The Warriors""), It might be difficult to sit through this again.",1130112000,4,1361,4.333333333333333

1193582,3,B000006GF6,"The basic premise of ""The Driver"" reminded me alot of ""Heat"" where a stoic master criminal faces off against a passionately determined cop.  The similarities end there.  That's not to say that Bruce Dern's energetic cop was not an engaging character but there is no discernible chemistry between himself and Ryan O'Neal's taciturn driver.  Dern may as well be acting with a crash test dummy.  The only time that O'Neal seems to be really engaged here is in the film's car chase scenes.  Another irritant was the film's characters don't have real names(i.e ""the Driver"", ""the Detective"", ""the Player"", etc.).  Director-screenwriter Walter Hill may think this is profound but it smacks more to me as pretentious.  The film can be recommended solely for it's car chase sequences as opposed to it's middling story.",1120003200,,810,5.045112781954887
1193583,4,B000006GF6,"In the late `70s and early `80s Walter Hill was one of the best action/thriller directors. Like Don Siegel and Sam Peckinpah before him, Hill made lean, gritty no-nonsense genre pictures like The Warriors, Southern Comfort and 48HRS. He understands that what drives an action film is visual storytelling through kinetic editing. This is what propels his under-appreciated movie, The Driver that is finally seeing its debut on DVD.

The near dialogue-less opening heist/getaway sequence foreshadows the same kind of approach Michael Mann would later apply to his own urban crime thrillers, most notably, Thief, which owes a huge debt to The Driver in terms of style and attitude. The first car chase, where the Driver evades several police cars through city streets at night is the epitome of stylistic economy. There is no CGI, no special effects; just judicious use of editing and letting the action tell the story.

Hill employs a classic, no frills style of filmmaking that is almost non-existent in today's climate which is all about music video style and editing (which he dabbled with in Streets of Fire). He doesn't feel the need to spell things out through dialogue or providing unnecessary back stories. It's not important where this guy came from or that we even like him. This movie is a battle of wills between the Driver and the Detective.

There is a three-minute ""Alternate Beginning"" which establishes, early on, the detective's work philosophy and also the two women in the Driver's life. This prologue originally aired on television.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

Sadly, Fox has not included the 135 minute version that was shown at Los Angeles's American Cinemateque, which apparently included more car chases.",1120003200,17,1740,5.112676056338028

Before we begin to compare this classic to any other movie created in the last 10 to 20 years we need to remind ourselves that Driver was made in 1978. Back then if someone used the available technology to create a computer with the power of a common-garden-variety 2005 PC it would have probably dwarfed the Empire State Building! So taking into account that computer generated special effects (and editing) were therefore non existant Driver is an amazing feat. The extremely frustarated cop, Bruce Dern, and the ultimate Mr Cool-as-Ice get away driver, Ryan O'Neal, are brilliant in their battle of wits; god knows how many times the original ""How do we know you can drive?"" car park scene has been ripped off! Recommended for viewers who are sick of the modern cops-always-win story lines in NYPD, CSI etc because in Driver there are no winners; all the characters have their own diverse personalities but no one has a name. One question remains; with all the crap (that was even crap back then) from the 70's 80's and 90's re released on DVD, where is the Driver DVD?

1193586,5,B000006GF6,"They just don't make action movies like this anymore. This was director Walter Hill's (The Warriors, Long Riders, 48 Hrs) second feature after the 1975 street-fight movie 'Hard Times' with Charles Bronson and after more than 25 years it still holds up as one of the best action movies ever made.

Ryan O'Neal plays the Driver, a man of action not words; He is a getaway driver for anyone who needs it, and he's the best. Bruce Dern plays the determined cop out to catch him in act. There are many aspects that make The Driver so unique as well as exciting. First off the two leads are pure perfection, O'Neal was cast against type and his squinty black emotionless eyes and soft spoken demeanor work splendidly for the role, and Dern as the cocky, ambitious, and creepy cop has never been better.

Hill also wrote the screenplay which very much echoes the feeling of earlier film-noir movies. The characters don't have names, just titles; The Driver, The Cop, The Player, The Exchange Man...while this makes the story easy to follow, it also adds to the gritty flavor of the film.

And oh yes, the car chases. Superb. They are right up there with the ranks of 'Bullitt', 'French Connection', and 'Seven-Ups.'

The film has yet to be released on DVD, but is very deserving. I would love to watch those chase sequences in high quality. While Ryan O'Neal and Bruce Dern's star quality has faded away the film still has some die-hard fans and minor cult-status.",1103587200,6,1457,4.657587548638133

THE DRIVER is at or near the top of that list.  Why hasn't Vin Diesel tried for the remake?  Probably because it would lack the feel and look Walter Hill imprinted from his directors chair...San Francisco gets its own unique look.  What Michael Mann did with THIEF three years later in both style and character, Hill started here. Ryan O'Neal gives one his best outings as the nameless stoic, myopic master crook.  The acting belongs to Bruce Dern.  This is Dern at his best in his Oscar nominated year (COMING HOME)...best proved when he belittles one of his crew members (""Maybe you're a fruiter!"") then tells him to read the sports page first (""Best part of the newspaper:  winners, losers"") if he wants to become a better cop.

1193588,4,B000006GF6,"Walter Hill is the doyen of American action films, hands down.  1978's The Driver is one of his best; the focus here is on momentum, pure and simple.  There are great car chases and the slam-bang stuff is there in buckets--especially a great scene inside a parking garage in which the title character played by Ryan O'Neal demolishes a vermilion Mercedes Benz by screeching around corners all over the place, showing just how good a driver he is to skeptical crooks who need him as their getaway man.
A laconic flick to be sure, The Driver gives nobody names.  Bruce Dern is the snartass cop who's after the driver and even recruits bank robbers to nab him.  Natch, that doesn't work.  You could even say this is the quintessential Hill flick (although I am very partial to Trespass), since dialogue is overshadowed by car chases and all the other stuff manipulative people (cops and criminals both) do to make their place in the world.  What dialogue there is wastes no words, just like the plot wastes no time on what could be a possible romance (O'Neal and French lovely Isabelle Adjani), instead having the two of them partner up for a lot of dough--knowing glances, yeah, but no gooey stuff.
Ronee Blakley is also here in a smaller role as another great looking go-between for the driver, but she's not on screen a lot, and there's never even the faintest hint of any hanky-panky between them.
This is not only one of the best Hill flicks, but without question one of the best American action films ever made.  The recent drivel, I mean, Driven, with Stallone deserves to crash and burn, while The Driver--tight as a drum and slick as greased lightning--is a red hot roadster of a film.

1193589,4,B000006GF6,"It's too bad director Walter Hill will likely be remembered more for providing Eddie Murphy with his first big screen showcase (in ""48 Hours"") than for his overall contribution to the American action film genre. Hill's tough-as-nails 1978 noir ""The Driver"" is arguably both his least-known and best work. Ryan O'Neal is quite effective as a dour, sociopathic ""wheelman"" who hires himself out as a getaway driver for assorted criminal enterprises. Bruce Dern is at his sleazy best as the cynical but driven cop on his trail. O'Neal and Dern play this classic cat-and-mouse noir scneario to the hilt (similar to Pacino and DeNiro's relationsip in 1995's ""Heat""). Isabelle Adjani's icy beauty well suits her role as O'Neal's fatalistic girlfriend. It's ironic that Ryan O'Neal's best films seem to be the ones where he doesn't have to recite much dialogue (""Barry Lyndon""). Supposedly the word count for O'Neal's lines in ""The Driver"" totals a scant 350 (!) according to a ""factoid"" that prefaced a recent cable airing.

7904217,4,B000006GF6,"Possible spoilers.  Great car chase scenes have been a key ingredient in action based movie going way back to the silent era.  Certainly the Fast and Furious franchise is nothing but.  For me, Im usually looking for those films where you have real stunt drivers doing real driving.  Most recently, Baby Driver fit the bill although one could argue that music is a more dominant component.  In 2012, Nicolas Winding Refns Drive with Ryan Gosling caught my attention.  But again, the musical score plays a big part in the films success.  Many people, including me, consider Bullitt from 1968 or The French Connection from 1971 to be the best ever.  Interestingly, both films feature cops in the lead roles.  Other contenders could certainly be Ronin (1998) or the Mad Max films.  There are many others.

One that is usually overlooked is The Driver from 1978 which was written and directed by Walter Hill (48 Hrs) in his second outing behind the camera.  The late, great film critic, Roger Ebert once wrote that a college professor taught him to be wary of stories where the characters have the name of objects or things.  Characters with Thing Names are only symbolic and have a way of sinking the stories they're in.  In this movie everyone has a Thing Name.

Ryan ONeal stars as The Driver, who like Baby Driver only drives the getaway car after the thieves do their thing on a bank or grocery store.  Unlike Baby Driver, this driver gets to pick and choose who he does business with.  And hes particular in that regard.  And hes handsome and cool, just like Goslings character in Drive.  And like most drivers in film he doesnt talk much, especially when driving.  The Drivers foil in this film is The Detective (Bruce Dern), who one might have surmised is the cop out to bring down The Driver or Cowboy as he likes to call him.  The Detectives partners are billed as Plainclothesman, one Red (Matt Clark) and one Gold (Felice Orlandi).  They constantly question their bosss competency believing hes obsessed with The Driver.  Captain Ahab obsessed.  Other key players are Ronee Blakley as The Connection.  She sets up The Drivers jobs.  Or job interviews would be a better description.  Then there is the young French starlet, Isabelle Adjani who is The Player.  She acts as an intermediary for The Driver.  She has the same cool demeanor as The Driver.

What makes this movie worthy of watching are the excellent car chase sequences.  Actually the best may not be a chase at all.  The scene takes place inside a parking garage and The Driver meets with some potential clients, called Glasses and Teeth.  They question paying so much of the take when they haven't seen The Driver actually drive.  So they climb in Glasses bright orange Mercedes-Benz 280SE and The Driver gives them the ride of their life inside the garage, destroying the car but leaving it totally drivable.

The film hasn't much of a plot obviously but little cat-and-mouse games between The Driver and The Detective add some fun to go with the car action.  ONeal and Adjani give equally wooden performances and Dern is that over-the-top, wide-eye crazy person weve come to love.  I had a good time.  Recommended.",1503705600,,3185,4.755027422303473
