I have never seen a harp played like this before, in fact, I have very seldom seen any instrument played this well and with this much creativity and energy before. The Grand Rapids Orchestra was amazing and creative and the perfect blend with Deborah Henson-Conant. As if her talent with the harp isn't enough, her voice is an amazing and beautiful instrument in itself. It literally brought tears to my eyes. Even my six year old son was enthralled. This is the most fantastic performance I've ever seen!",1154390400,6,588,4.609523809523809
2604770,5,B000GD85J4,"Entertaining, moving, funny, visually and sonically excellent, this disc reaches a broad audience with a fantastic mixture of storytelling and original compositions from one dynamo of a performer.  The disc is packed with interviews and clips about creating the performance and the ideas behind the pieces.  Shot in HD and mixed in stereo and surround....enjoy!!!!",1153872000,6,364,5.6
8130607,5,B000GD85J4,I have loved this artist for years.  Her inventivness/humor/ability to cross over between classical and blues harp.  It was an oxymoron before she explored the versatility of the harp.,1433980800,,184,5.310344827586207
8130608,5,B000GD85J4,"Mind boggling!  A must for anyone that plays harp, or love the instrument.  Ms. Conant brings new excitement to the stage.",1427760000,,122,4.761904761904762
8130609,5,B000GD85J4,"This far surpassed my expectations.  What a wonderful concert.  I only wish that everybody was familiar with her music.  She plays the electric harp.  The conductor of the Grand Rapids, Michigan Symphony Orchestra was also outstanding.  Her concert includes a great mix of music from the very serious to just plain fun!  Buy it folks, you won't be sorry!",1412294400,,354,4.915254237288136
8130610,5,B000GD85J4,"Deborah Henson-Conant is an amazing performing artist! She composes, plays both pedal harp and electric lever harp, tells tales, and sings songs from the sublime to the ridiculous. Tears and laughter! Her harp blues is unique among harpists.

I recommend this DVD of an wonderful concert given by Deborah Henson-Conant with the dynamic Grand Rapids Symphony, and the multi-talented conductor, David Lockington. A fantastic show, full of surprises as well as luv'ly melodies, such as her well-known harp piece, The Nightingale.

A Must-See!",1394496000,,539,5.481927710843373
8130611,5,B000GD85J4,"I have never seen anything quite like Deborah!  What a versatile, soulful, playful, gifted performer and story teller.  I highly recommend this concert to anyone who not only loves the harp, but loves to be entertained, enchanted, bewitched, and loves humor.  This DVD is a lovely gift or perfect for your own collection.  I have watched it multiple times so far, never tire of it, and look forward to the next time I watch it.  I have given copies to friends as gifts and will be on the lookout for more copies to give away.  Her CD's are wonderful, but watching her perform on the DVD is the best experience when getting acquainted with this gifted musician.  Enjoy!",1356566400,,668,4.610169491525424
8130612,2,B000GD85J4,"I was searching for a good harp player (jazz) and read a reccomendation
on this DVD as a ""must have"" harp masterpiece.
I bought this DVD with the hope to hear good jazz from the harp. Instead what I heard was a lot of talking from the player. If you like stories this is the DVD you want.",1192752000,,288,3.9827586206896552
8130613,5,B000GD85J4,"Deborah Henson-Conant is amazing!  A friend of mine introduced me to her music and I was entranced, I had to have  copy of Invention & Alchemy for my own! Now I do thank you!",1168473600,3,174,4.088235294117647
8130614,5,B000GD85J4,"I have had the pleasure of seeing Deborah Henson-Conant perform in person many times, but nothing prepared me for the caliber of this endeavor!

Everything - from the lush, dramatic lighting and unique, dynamic camera angles to the poignant, often heartbreakingly beautiful stories and exuberant theatrics - moved me.  Almost to the point of tears even!!

You think you know the harp - think again!  I'll never look at the instrument the same way ever again - or any instrument for that matter.

I recommend this DVD to anyone...EVERYONE!  Not just for classical music lovers.  This is a whole new genre!

In case it's not clear from my gushing, I LOVE this DVD!  Every single minute of it.  And you will too!",1163635200,4,709,4.737704918032787
8130615,5,B000GD85J4,"I am seldom moved to tears by a music DVD, but this one did it--repeatedly!  Deborah Henson-Conant is beyond talented--she's a living whirlwind of energy and musicality.  She plays harp like an angel--and like the baddest heavy metal guitarist you ever saw.  She sings like an angel too.  And her orchestrations....well, as a symphony musician let me say that her orchestral colorations over the entire spectrum of musical genres is utterly astounding.  She could orchestrate Broadway shows.

If you thing a harp concert is dull and fussy....boy are you going to be SURPRISED!  It's hot, it's sexy, it's incredibly moving, and it BOOGIES!

Yes--rock harp!  And it's also very funny in spots.  You'll never look at a symphony orchestra the same way again after ""The Danger Zone.""

In short, this DVD is fun, hip, funky, deep, medatative, very meaningful....and a damn good evening's entertainment for even your fav punk rocker!",1159228800,5,926,5.1066666666666665
8130616,5,B000GD85J4,"I saw Deborah in concert at a small church in Denver this summer where she performed some songs from the CD/DVD. She is fantastic! The DVD is high-quality, professional and worth every penny. The photography captures up-close-and-personal her nuances, enthusiasm, energy and tremendous talent. The lighting, colors and orchestra all blend with fabulous music to make this DVD worth buying and watching. I highly recommend it!",1158278400,7,425,5.454545454545454
