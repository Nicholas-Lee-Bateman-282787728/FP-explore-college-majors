8225677,5,B000WTZ630,This is the best video on strategy for singles tennis and I have a few. This VHS covers both the strategy and mental aspects of the game. The mental is crucial to being able to win in Tennis. VHS is over an hour long.,1520726400,,217,3.9545454545454546
8225678,5,B000WTZ630,I made a mistake when purchasing this as I already had series 1 and thought for the price this was the 16 disc set-it was my error but I cannot figure out why this series 1 was so much more expensive than the one I purchased a few years ago - it is only 2 discs but a good series. If the 16 disc set ever becomes available I doubt I could afford it -be careful with your wish list!  The 16 disc was what was in my list and that is why I thought I was getting the whole set I wanted.,1485475200,,482,3.679611650485437

8225680,4,B000WTZ630,"This review is based on the first two seasons of 'The Clinic' seen on AcornTV. This is a series based in Ireland, and the characters all have Irish accents, very easy to understand. The series has been compared to the US series 'ER'. I see nothing comparable except it follows the lives of people who work in a clinic. The series is very well written and acted.

The series is centred on the staff of the Clarence Street Clinic in Dublin, Ireland. Clarence Street Clinic is a multi-disciplinary health center which allows for a diverse cast. The Clinic follows the lives and loves of the Clarence Street professionals headed by husband and wife doctors,  Ed Costello played by David Wilmot and Cathy Costello, played by the striking, Aisling OSullivan. The staff have their own responsibilities, and we see them as they try to work together as a team.  Dan Woodhouse, the slick plastic surgeon with a somewhat creepy past, has addictions to women and drugs. Physiotherapist Keelin Geraghty's mother has a terminal disease, and she struggles with her own issues. One of the receptionists, Fiona develops an obsession with Ed, and it seems strange to me that no one intervenes in this mess.  The sloppy counsellor, Patrick, is struggling to stay sober while handing out advice to his colleagues. The patients add extra fun and excitement, many bringing their own issues to highlight the messiness of the staff's lives.

In these two series, many of these personal issues come to a head. Not one person on the staff is without problems, several at the same time. Will the staff be able to heal themselves?

The series is set in modern times Dublin, Ireland.  The series starts in 2003...Great cast, modern story lines, well acted!  A truly great show!!  Very disappointed to not be able to continue watching this show!  I believe there a
re at least 10 seasons!",1384041600,3,530,4.526315789473684
8225682,4,B000WTZ630,"I am watching the first season. I sure wish we could get more seasons. The acting is great and the plots believable.

Apparantely, this is all we can get in the US.",1299974400,4,164,4.125
8225683,5,B000WTZ630,"The Clinic is an Irish medical drama about a small co-op of doctors offices and the day-to-day lives of the people who work there.  It's warm, and friendly, and at the same time, back-handed and secretive.  I can't express at how quickly I got immersed into this show.  There are only a handful of episodes in the first season, and to be honest, I HATE that there aren't anymore season released on DVD (the show apparently ran for 7 seasons in Ireland).  The characters are so well intentioned, yet their emotional hangups get them into so much trouble.  It's impossible to predict what will happen on this show (though you'll try).  There's no accurate way to describe it.  The best I can come up with is it's like if the show ""House"" was based in a bed & breakfast and no one was arrogant.  It's a tremendously great show, but knowing I can't watch the other seasons, I kinda wish I had never started.",1274140800,11,903,4.463414634146342
8225684,1,B000WTZ630,"Stockton's presentation was boring and repeatitous.  The date on the video profile was 1994,  but it was so boring that I resented the time I spent  watching and felt mislead into thinking it was a recent production...it  appeared to have been filmed in the late 70's.  A real waste of time.",967075200,3,291,4.627450980392157
