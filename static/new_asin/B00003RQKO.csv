1332561,4,B00003RQKO,very entertaining mix of somewhat original action scenes and some good chemistry between cuba gooding jr. and ulrich. a pretty cool way to chill out on a hot summer day.,954288000,,169,4.666666666666667
1332562,5,B00003RQKO,This movie was ignored at the box office because Warner hardly advertised! A real shame because it is actually a really good action flick.,953424000,,138,4.791666666666667
1332563,5,B00003RQKO,"This movie was great.  Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr are so funny together.  This movie is worth seeing, it really keeps you on the edge of your seat and biting your nails at the end.

1332580,4,B00003RQKO,"I can't explain why, but I keep coming back to this movie every time the stars are right. Part of it is the chemistry between Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich; they make a good team, with the usual wisecracks and one-liners that are de-rigueur for an action comedy like this one. I also like the ex-military guy and his crew; they are pretty standard fare for this sort of movie, but they never get tiresome, so it works. I think a big part of the attraction for me, though, is Elvis, the chemical weapon that is the movie's McGuffin. I cannot get enough of blue goo that kills you right in the face if it gets warmer than 50F (figuratively speaking, of course - if Elvis were real, 0.000 micrograms would be 'enough', and I could easily get that much (preferably even less ;) ))",1427932800,,780,4.3493150684931505

1332599,4,B00003RQKO,"I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this one was pretty funny. Ulrich and Gooding worked well together, and their humor blends fantastically to lighten even the direst situations. Definitely worth watching despite the unreality of the story.",1400544000,,245,5.15

1332618,5,B00003RQKO,"CHILL FACTOR is one of those films that i bought because it sounded good...but, it's not good-It's GRRRREAT!!!!!!!
It's a good ""sleeper"" low-budget movie with action and a ticking bomb, that CAN'T get above 50 degrees F.  Otherwise, the crystals detonate and destruction for miles and dozens/hundreds of miles will occur!!!  The bomb is called, ""ELVIS"" and it kills anything living/organic compounds within a matter of seconds.  The first few mins. of the film show what ELVIS can do, when it kills from its detonation.  Quite incredible!!!!!
So, the last thing is: either you will be like me-and you will LOVE this film,  -or-  You won't!!!  But, check it out, nonetheless!!  I highly recommend it.  I find myself watching it once, then wanting to watch it again, the day after.  $",1246406400,,782,4.900763358778626
1332619,4,B00003RQKO,"What a surprise this was.  With no real pre-conceived ideas I thoroughly enjoyed this film mainly because the on-screen chemistry between Mr Ulrich and Mr Gooding Jnr worked well, but also because I was half expecting a low budget B movie and in fact it was pretty high tech, action packed, good plot, A movie, thrill ride.  What one might call a hidden gem. Peter Firth was a bonus as the bad guy and some of the special effects were good.  Well worth a look. Entertaining.",1239321600,,474,4.488372093023256

1332621,4,B00003RQKO,"And I enjoyed every minute of it.  The opening scene sets the tone for what makes the military officer go mad and bent on revenge (unfortunately, you do see scapegoats in the military, just as in most other occupations).  And the premises is good with a real message ... you are just an average citizen but what lengths would you go to save others from terrorists?

Having commented on all the serious stuff, now must say I laughed my butt off during a good part of this movie.  This was a terrific buddy movie -- Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr. have chemistry you rarely see.  They really play off each other just right.

This isn't one of the great movies of all time, but it sure is a darn good one.  Be warned, however, that there are some pretty bloody scenes.  Unfortunately that's what comes with terrorism.  This movie really has a serious underlying tone, but it balances very well with Ulrich and Gooding's (comedic) interaction.

Finally, Comcast needs to change its rating from 1-1/2 stars. Comcast Cable itself is screwed up, and obviously the same is to be said for their movie ratings.  (I definitely think it's worth owning, which is why I ordered it today.)",1217808000,,1176,4.605769230769231
1332622,4,B00003RQKO,I watched this mainly because Cuba was in it. He always delivers. He had some very funny parts in this one. There was some horror in this show. The faint of heart shouldn't see it. If you like Cuba you will enjoy this movie.,1190505600,,224,4.113636363636363
1332623,5,B00003RQKO,A great movie.  DVD is of excellent quality and the storyline moves along quickly with lots of humour amid a dangerous situation.,1152403200,,129,4.863636363636363
1332624,5,B00003RQKO,"CHILL FACTOR is a combination of almost every action movie of the past ten years, but it is entertaining, fast-paced, with some really exciting action sequences.  Director Hugh Johnson wisely eschews character development and focuses on the chase.  Peter Firth does a good job as the villainous Bremer, an Army general who took the fall for a disastrous chemical warfare accident which killed 18 soldiers.  After ten years in prison, he vows revenge by selling the deadly agent to the highest bidder.  Skeet Ulrich as the badboy Mason and Cuba Gooding Jr. as the ice cream truck driver he forces to help him transport the deadly agent to an Army base in Montana do well in their buddy roles.  CHILL FACTOR stretches the limits for credibility, but it moves well and entertains, that's what this kind of movie should do.",1100390400,,819,4.821428571428571
1332625,2,B00003RQKO,"Skeet Ulrich (Scream, The Newton Boys) and Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Jerry Maguire, Judgment Night) star as a couple of normal guys who team up together and hit the road with a bomb, nicely named Elvis,  in the back of an ice cream truck and they have to keep it cool otherwise it will blow up. Meanwhile, the stiff badguy, Peter Firth (Pearl Harbor) is hot on their tail to try to get the bomb from them. Supposed buddy flick doesnt hold up to it's end and the supporting cast is wasted off, Firth's badguy isn't even that great of a villain. Ulrich and Gooding, Jr. are a good team but they aren't fit for their parts, though they have some funny scenes, particualarly the scene where they louge the boat down the hill, otherwise it's all throwaway. David Paymer (Mr. Saturday Night, Quiz Show) and Kevin J' O Connor (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns) also star.",1099267200,3,853,4.467948717948718
1332642,2,B00003RQKO,"IT'S AMAZING HOW A GREAT ACTOR LIKE CUBA GOODING, JR. COULD WIN A BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR OSCAR FOR ''JERRY MAGUIRE'' AND THEN END UP IN A LOWBROW MOVIE LIKE THIS. A COOK [SKEET ULRICH] AND A THIEF [CUBA GOODING, JR.] MUST STOP A DEADLY CHEMICAL WEAPON FROM BEING USED BY A MADMAN [PETER FIRTH]. THE ACTION IS DECENT AND IT HAS A NICE SENSE OF HUMOR BUT THIS MOVIE JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. I WOULDN'T REALLY RECCOMEND THIS TO ACTION FANS. BUT IF YOU LIKE THIS SORT OF ACTION FILM, GIVE IT A TRY.",1093564800,2,500,4.21875
1332643,2,B00003RQKO,"This film had some decent action scenes, but it was nothing beyond that. The story is a [compilation] of several movies you've already seen, the characters are dry and pointless, and Cuba Gooding Jr never seems to nail down exactly what kind of character he's portraying. I can't watch him act... I never know where he's coming from, and I can't watch him act like virtually the same character in every one of his movies. Skeet plays his part with no heart as well... in fact the entire cast does. I guess it must be hard to do a movie knowing the script is as horrible as this one.
Don't waste your money. There are better action films out there with heartfelt acting. This one isn't it.",1051056000,,688,4.425196850393701
1332644,4,B00003RQKO,"This is one of those movies that often gets overlooked because it was not a big hit at the box office. Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Peter Firth, and the rest the cast turn in great performances. I always like Gooding but I think this is one of his best roles. To me much better than ""Jerry McGuire"" or ""Pearl Harbor"". The story is good, the sets are great, and the music nicely adds to the action/drama. If you enjoyed ""Broken Arrow"", ""Outbreak"", or ""The Rock"" you should enjoy this movie. It is a rollercoaster ride as Gooding and Ulrich try to stop terrorist from using a nerve gas (ELVIS) on the public and deliver it to a military base. Cuba drives an ice cream delivery truck and Skeet works in a diner.

When a scientist drops this biohazardous weapon in their lap at the diner with terrorist hot on his trail it takes off running. As they try to keep it from the terrorist they must maintain it at a temperature no warmer than 50 degrees. Ever try to defend an ice cream truck driving on mountainous roads in traffic? This is one of my favorite action films and I think it is often underrated by cynics. If you like action movies with Cage, Travolta, Stallone, Willis, or Schwarzenegger I will be surprised if you are disapointed. It is one you will enjoy going back and watching on a regular basis. I recommend buying it on DVD. If you like Cuba Gooding Jr. be sure to see ""Murder of Crows"" as well.",1037145600,5,1410,4.361216730038023
1332645,3,B00003RQKO,"Chill Factor is an action adventure where the basic premise has just enough credibility to set things in motion, and then we're off!  Circumstances bring together a wisecracking ice cream deliveryman named Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a convenience store worker, Tim Mason (Skeet Ulrich), for an off beat adventure through some picturesque locations in the Montana countryside.
Working for the Army, scientist Richard Long, develops a deadly defoliant, code named ""Elvis"".  A disaster during testing, on a remote island island, results in the court martial and imprisonment of the Army officer in charge, Major Brynner (Peter Firth).  Long is unpunished, and continues to work for the Army.  When released from prison ten years later, an angry Brynner is bent on revenge, and breaks into an Army research facility, seeking to get his hands on the agent, which must be kept refrigerated to remain inactive.  A fleeing Long, delivers ""Elvis"" to his friend Mason, with instructions to take it to a nearby Army base.  Arlo's refrigerated, ice cream truck seems the perfect method of transport, and he becomes a reluctant participant in the delivery run.
The partnership works well for the most part, as the pair evade Brynner and his band of mercenaries, retaliating with gusto when necessary.  There are continuity issues at a couple of places, but it's nothing fatal, and the story rolls on with plenty of explosions and gunfire.  Reasonably good performances for a film of this type are turned in by all.
The DVD contains informative production notes and visual effects features.  Chill Factor is not a great cinematic event, but if you relax and down shift your brain, you may find some enjoyment in the ride.",1023148800,,1708,5.049822064056939
1332646,2,B00003RQKO,"Chill Factor is about two idiots that are not at the good place at the good time...and of of them has a friend which is a scientist and who has a secret. But when they realize the secret Skeet Ulrich's friend had causes a lot of trouble...they play the heroes and get away in an ice cream truck containing the bomb their friend stole. And then comes a bunch of boring and cheap car pursuits where some terrorists get killed...Then they are captured by the terrorists and there is a big fight between ''good and evil''. The normal thing in an action movie. It is absolutely non realistic and stupid. Cuba Gooding Jr. is getting on my nerves! I think he was good in As Good As It Gets and maybe in Jerry Maguire....but after A Murder Of Crows, Instinct and Chill Factor, I guess he's ready to make straight to video movies(A Murder of Crows didn't play at the theatre). Skeet Ulrich is not very amazing....not as bad as Cuba Gooding Jr.! This is like Speed without scenario(and let's say that Speed had not a big and rich scenario...And it is a bit like Broken Arrow, without the cool action sequences, and the good acting of John Travolta (and maybe Christian Slater). You want to have fun and you are a big action fan? This film is not for you! You are a big INTELLIGENT film fan? This film is not for you either...It is not for anyone....nobody has to waste his time watching stupidities like this....avoid it please...this is not a BAD BAD BAD film....but still, not amazing at all.",1001721600,2,1484,4.459558823529412

I don't know about you, but two pretty guys and bunch of actions are all I expected out of this movie. Cuba and Skeet present themselves here as bunch of goofballs, which was successfully funny. This is not a serious film about a biochemical weapon, but it is simply an action-comedy. I must admit, without the boys, the plot of the movie is a bit too simple, but who needs a plot when there's Cuba and Skeet entertaining us with the perfect silly duet acting.",993945600,,566,4.299065420560748
1332648,2,B00003RQKO,"Seeing Cuba as the comic relief character was a shock to myself! ANyway, this movie is a good action picture, no brains needed, the actor giving the exactly level of acting the script needs ( be it, almost none ). FUn to watch once and only once",989625600,,245,4.23404255319149
1332649,4,B00003RQKO,"An Action film about a bomb (so to say) that will blow up if the temperature goes above 50 degrees. It seems a little Speedish, the bus will blow up if the speed goes below 50.  Besides that point the movie is pretty original, and fun. It stars Skeet Ulrich of the hugely popular Scream and Cuba Gooding Jr. from As Good As It Gets. Skeet Ulrich plays a waiter of a small little diner, when in the middle of the night a friend comes in half dead, and explains about the bomb, and the fact that it can't go above 50 degrees. Both of them are a little spooked, and don't really know what to do.  When they see a guy approach the diner, not looking like good business, they hide the know dead friend and pretend to be normal, which is a little hard. The guy looks for the body and doesn't find it then leaves.  The two then split out of there in an ice cream truck. Talk about perfect timing, and high tell it to get the bomb where it needs to go, with the bad goes hot in pursuit.  Chill Factor isn't the greatest action film, but the comedy and the fact that it stars Cuba Gooding Jr. helps it out. It isn't to suspenseful but it is a fun film to watch and love.  With a good cast , some good acting and great comedy touches, Chill Factor becomes better then most action films, such as Mission: Impossible 2, or Charlies Angels. Chill Factor is just good old fashioned fun.",981331200,,1372,4.142857142857143

1332662,4,B00003RQKO,This movie held my attention from the beginning.  I won't go into the storyline you can read amazon's editorial review.  But I would like to add that this movie has enough action to keep you interested and Skeet and Cuba have good chemistry together.  Some of the oneliners are pretty funny.  Give this a try. I think you will be glad you did.,970358400,,343,4.396825396825397
1332663,3,B00003RQKO,"In ""Chill Factor,"" Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Skeet Ulrich star as two average guys who find themselves in a stolen ice cream truck transporting a  volatile chemical weapon capable of destroying all animal life within a  500-mile diameter if the material (shades of ""Speed"") rises above 50  degrees Fahrenheit.  Hot on their tail come the men (and one woman) who  will stop at nothing to retrieve the explosive as well as a dimwitted  sheriff who mistakenly believes the two young gentlemen are responsible for  the death of the scientist who both invented the substance and guards it  from falling into enemy hands.
""Chill Factor"" is a decent enough action  film, short on credibility and originality but high on energy and visual  attractiveness.  The latter is attributable mainly to the gloriously scenic  and beautifully photographed Montana countryside where the film is set.  ""Chill Factor"" is also, however, replete with the usual array of action  movie staples:  impressive but wholly implausible action and stunt  sequences, the running exchange of dimwitted quips and wearying verbal  badinage - sometimes between the main characters themselves and sometimes  between them and those who are out to kill them - that occurs virtually  without pause throughout the movie and, finally, stock villains that come  straight from the cinema factory that seems to spit out these cookie-cutter  action films with almost unconscionable frequency.
On the positive  side, director Hugh Johnson knows how to keep the action moving forward at  a brisk pace and Gooding and Ulrich, despite the fact that the screenplay  offers neither actor much of a chance to flex his thespian muscles, at  least make for a likeable movie-buddy team.  Still, one wonders whatever  happened to Gooding, Jr.'s career which seemed so promising just a few  years back after he won the Academy Award for his work in ""Jerry Maguire.""  Likeable as he is in ""Chill Factor,"" one would like to see this performer  applying his talents to more challenging and worthy fare than he has of  late been doing.",965606400,3,2068,5.1017964071856285
1332664,5,B00003RQKO,"I thought Skeet was good in Scream and Cuba was excellent in this.  The comedy mixed with the suspense and action was unbelievable.  This one friend of mine told me about this movie and I went and rented it, and I  loved it.  I didn't think it would be as good as it is, but it's great.  This is a movie I would definately buy if I had the chance.  This movie has  a little bit of the Rock in it, but it's really different.  Cuba and Skeet  make a team that has never been thought of before and I think they should  get back together and do a sequel or something.  Haha, it could happen!",963705600,,587,3.9741379310344827

1332666,3,B00003RQKO,"The movie starts out with a bang, with very cool special effects. However the background of the bad guy could have been better defined as to why he was stationed on Horn Island and why he had not advanced very far. The  confrontation in the diner is really cool. The breaking into the lab was  boring and could have had more action in it. The parts involving the good  guy's gun and the ice cream truck are pretty funny as is the episode with  the cell phone when ""It's for you,"" is said. The object of  keeping ""Elvis"" cold while providing for a cool title detracted  from the plot. While the ending was annoyingly abrupt, it was made up for  with the action and special effects making it a pretty cool ending. While  this movie could have been better it was overall pretty good.",962755200,,780,4.368055555555555
1332667,3,B00003RQKO,"Well don't expect an intelligent plot and good actors when you rent or buy this movie but sometimes, the most stupid movies are the most entertaining of them all....

Off  course some bad guys are after that weapon which Cuba and Skeet are driving  through the state ina an icecream-truck... There are some very decent  action scenes that'll put you to the edge of your seat.  So forget logic  and let yourself be chillled by an entertainig and fast-paced movie that  doesn't want to be more than that. Now we all now that Cuba Gooding Jr. is  an excellent actor but unfortunetly his two-dimensional character doesn't  leave him any space to do so. Skeet Ulrich... well did you expect him to do  anything elkse than just trying to look good with his big dark eyes? So  just take out the Popcorn and enjoy the ride!

1332668,4,B00003RQKO,"Chill Factor is by no means a classic, it's predictable, un-original and can seem quite daft at times. However it is one of those films you can forgive very easily, apart from the first 20 minutes it offers non-stop  action which will keep you on the edge of your seat, it's funny (especially  Gooding Jr) fresh and a real all round laugh. A perfect film to watch with  your mates.",959558400,,381,4.414285714285715
1332669,1,B00003RQKO,"This 3rd rate action adventure guy flick will probably set Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s career back about 10 years.  This film is basically a variation on ""Speed"" where instead of keeping the bus above 50 mph, they had to keep the unstable chemical warfare bomb below 50 degrees.
Two regular guys  (actually two screw ups) must save the world from a group of rogue military  mercenaries who are trying to steal a potent chemical weapon and sell it on  the open market.  The chemical is unstable above 50 degrees Fahrenheit and  will explode stripping the skin from any living creature within a hundred  miles.  Our heroes must get this doomsday weapon to the nearest army base  armed only with a broken down ice cream truck and a pistol with no ammo.  The half a dozen bad guys are all have elite military background, the  latest in electronic equipment, souped up SUV's, and an arsenal of advanced  weaponry.  Predictably, the mercenaries are no match for our screw  ups.
This film is one big chase scene that takes implausibility to new  heights of incredulity. The dialogue between Arlo (Gooding) and Tim (Skeet  Ulrich) is mindless tripe that attempts to be funny but merely makes the  characters seem pathetic.  This is consistent with all the writing in this  screenplay which is mostly hack.
As far as I can tell, this is Hugh  Johnson's debut as a first line feature director, having mostly done  assistant and second unit direction and cinematography.  In this regard he  fails to distinguish himself.  His camera work was pedestrian and scene  selection was pretty much stock for the genre.  The first third of the film  was shot with a blue filter, to get a dark look.  The odd thing was, he  kept the blue filter for the indoor shots and subsequent daytime shots.  This indiscriminate use of the filter, rather than creating an effect just  made the entire film look washed out.  Then suddenly, he abandoned it  entirely.  On a plus note, the stunts and pyrotechnics were handled well as  were the special effects when the chemical weapon test went awry at the  beginning of the film.  There were some effective moments of suspense like  when they tried to take the oversized ice cream truck past the narrow road  on the cliff.
Cuba Gooding, Jr. did his best to bring life to a very  insubstantial character. He was witty and energetic as  always but there was no saving Arlo.  Skeet Ulrich was utterly bland as Tim  Mason.  David Paymer was decent as the arrogant scientist who's ambition  for his work exceeded the limits of prudent science.  Peter Firth was  dreadful as the evil Captain Brynner, leader of the rogue soldiers.
All  in all, this film was a loser.  I give it a 3/10.  For guys who want a good  beer buzz movie while the wife and kids are out of town, this might be  okay.  Otherwise steer clear.",955843200,3,2816,4.663934426229508
1332670,3,B00003RQKO,"With the movies being as poor as they are this year, this one is pretty good.  I wouldn't call it action packed, but a couple of scenes were pretty explosive.  If you are looking for action packed footage, this isn't it.  The acting isn't bad and their are a few elements of comedy.  The story  line is pretty typical; REGULAR good guys have something the REAL bad guys  want.  This movie is worth the rent.  If you saw Bowfinger and were not  impressed and saw Sixth Sense and really enjoyed it, I believe you will  agree with my review.",955411200,,538,4.343434343434343
1332671,4,B00003RQKO,"I loved this movie. It is actually one of the coolest action movies I've seen. And there's a true fact about this film: to enjoy as it should be done, you have to be looking just for a good time, nothing else. Do not  expect a great movie, because it's not; just expect to have a good time. I  love the Gooding/Ulrich couple and the music of Hans Zimmer gives this film  a very good rythm. Check this out, and if you're just looking for a good  time, you won't be dissapointed!",954806400,,477,4.1521739130434785
