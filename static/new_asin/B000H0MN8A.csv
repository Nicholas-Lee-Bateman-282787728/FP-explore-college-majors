8135737,4,B000H0MN8A,A VERY GOOD ADVENTURE MOVIE,1474416000,,27,4.6
8135738,5,B000H0MN8A,"If you're looking for high budget super special effects, don't look here.  This is done as a super cheesy version of the story of Ivanhoe.  I loved the 1st one (it's very dorky, the acting is way over the top & exaggerated in so many areas), and I just find it fun. I've been hooked on this 3-movie collection since I first saw it, but I'm also of an age that I'm used to the claymation having been the very best Hollywood had to offer at one time. These are the B-flicks of the Sci-Fi world, and I love 'em!",1363737600,,508,4.07
8135739,4,B000H0MN8A,"These are must have cheesy movies. We call them the movies with no dragons. You can find dragons on each of the three DVD covers, but there are no dragons in any of the six stories. Make it a night of laughing at and poking fun at these low budget fantasy movies. At least the story line moves along.",1273276800,2,300,4.101694915254237
8135740,2,B000H0MN8A,"We discovered the Darkest Knight accidentally at a yard sale. I admit- at $1.00 I feel we overpaid, but it has been a true joy to laugh at along with my daughter. The special effects are painful and truly bring a new definition to 'special' effects. I have seen better CGI monsters in free video games.
There is far too much to lampoon in a short review. Strike in any direction- you can't help but hit a worthy target. The stories are full of stereotypes, and despite the rich plot potential of medieval England in the time of Richard the Lionhearted and Ivanhoe, the writing seems to have been choreographed to limit the need for anything beyond the three or four reused sets and CGI castles.
The best contribution to this series by far is the rich cover art for each of the DVDs that make up the series. Majestic castlescapes with burning orange color and menacing dragons circling the parapets or gnashing teeth in beastial fury- despite the complete lack of a single dragon in any of the first three DVDs (outside of the opening credits, where Ivanhoe inexplicably battles dragons that appear nowhere else).
My daughter bought me the second and third as a Fathers Day gift. We had a grand old time playing Mystery Science Theater on the living room couch. Great entertainment, if only by pure accident.

My daughter wants me to add that my wife walked into the living room as we were screening the movies to find out what comedy we had in the DVD player that had us laughing so hard. We had a hard time explaining that it wasn't a comedy... intentionally.",1245801600,3,1560,4.571428571428571
8135741,4,B000H0MN8A,"This DVD is two episodes of what I hear is a ten episode collection.  There is Darkest Knight, Darkest Knight 2, Darkest Knight III, and Fantasy Quest.  Each with two episodes each.  And I guess from what other reviewers said under the Fantasy Quest review area a fifth disk bring it to ten episodes; I have no idea of what that disk is called or I would own it too.  The acting is ok, not great, the sets are poor, the stories are ok, they are all studio B.  I watch them now and then.  Most Fantasy Questing type movies are low budget; there are a few like The Lord of the Rings that are not, but most are studio B.  And if you like these type of movies, as I do, then you watch a lot of low quality movies; and this is two episodes of one such DVD set.",1243468800,2,755,3.9602649006622515
8135742,5,B000H0MN8A,You have to be a fan of British TV to love this. It's in the vein of the old Saturday morning serials. Corny with special effects. The characters are lovable and the acting fits the series. It's true fun to watch and one the kiddies can enjoy.,1229472000,,243,4.191489361702128
8135743,1,B000H0MN8A,"Quite possibly the cheesiest movie ever made.  Bad acting, horrible special effects, no plot, cheezy lines, terrible cinematography (red filters, repeated shots and scenes, just incredible).  I could go on but...  It's so bad, it's hilarious, truly laugh-out-loud hilarious.  At times, better than a Monty Python.  You'll think it's a spoof, but it's not.",1112486400,,355,5.5
