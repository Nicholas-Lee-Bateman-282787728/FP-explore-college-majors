5717258,5,B00CEB72WW,The clueless Count Arthur and his constant use of malapropisms is a riot!  I love Rory Kinnear in everything he does.  The chemisty and comedic timing are impeccable.  I'm anxiously awaiting season 3.  This show has quickly become one of my all time favorites.,1473465600,4,260,4.840909090909091
5717259,5,B00CEB72WW,Great show. Made by some of the same folks as the IT crowd.  It is a very clean humor as well.,1472774400,2,94,3.4761904761904763

5717262,5,B00CEB72WW,"CAS is the strongest, funniest show from the UK in ages. It's as if you are stepping back in time - to the greatness of a series like Father Ted, where every character is perfectly realized and hilarious.
By S1Ep2 of CAS, you will be hooked.
There's 2 seasons already (available here), and S3 is now in progress.
Thanks Seeso for bringing it.",1464393600,2,342,4.444444444444445

5717268,5,B00CEB72WW,"Need an antidote to all of the violence, sex, in short, the dark side of life you see in so much TV these days? If so, try this. Very good.",1477699200,,139,3.6666666666666665
5717269,5,B00CEB72WW,Great comedy.  Not to be missed!,1477612800,,32,4.333333333333333
5717270,3,B00CEB72WW,I enjoyed watching Count Arthur Strong because I have a quirky sense of humor.,1477526400,,78,4.642857142857143
5717271,3,B00CEB72WW,"It was OK, not tertific. I didn't watch the entire season; it seemed typical sitcom.",1477008000,,84,4.666666666666667
5717272,5,B00CEB72WW,Thank god for british humor! More please!,1477008000,,41,5.0
5717273,5,B00CEB72WW,"This is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long, long time. The Count carries the show, even the occasional bathroom humor doesn't offend. Though, without the Count minor characters couldn't make it on their own.",1476921600,,218,4.7631578947368425
5717274,5,B00CEB72WW,"Possibly, one of the funniest shows to come out of GB. I love it! I wish i had 100 episodes to watch.",1476921600,,101,3.6363636363636362
8580748,5,B00CEB72WW,"I really enjoyed this show!  Hardly a surprise as it was helmed by the same person who created The IT Crowd, Graham Linehan.  Of course most of the credit goes to Steve Delaney as Count Arthur Strong.  It's such a fun, silly show but also has a lot of heart.  I admit I was a bit teary eyed watching episode six, season one.  Please, please let there be further seasons.",1500163200,,370,4.228571428571429
8580749,5,B00CEB72WW,Season 2 episode 2 had me laughing so hard it hurt.,1499990400,,51,3.727272727272727
8580750,5,B00CEB72WW,"Count Arthur Strong is what all comedy series dream of being.  It is laugh out loud funny.  Hell, I even applauded a few times. The perfect balance of hi-jinx, humour, silliness, outlandishness, and poignancy. The writing is tight and spot on.  The acting is nuanced and with no unintentional absurdity.  A beautifully funny and wonderful time.",1498780800,2,344,5.089285714285714
8580751,5,B00CEB72WW,"Amazing show, one of the funniest ever in British television. I have seen all the classical British shows and many more and hence I have base for this opinion. Give it a chance, pass half the first episode, and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1493683200,3,244,4.568181818181818
8580752,5,B00CEB72WW,I am a huge fan of Count Arthur Strong and this series is great. I can't wait for Season 3. This first season has loads of laughs and then a few twists that reveal surprising depths in the primary characters.,1492646400,,208,4.225
8580753,5,B00CEB72WW,I had to get the acorn channel because I couldn't be away from the show any longer.. Chris Ryman is my hero!! Give us more Steven Delaney!!,1491350400,,139,4.185185185185185

8580755,1,B00CEB72WW,"I only made it through the first ten minutes of this ""comedy""!
The laugh track alone would have driven me nuts; loud extended laughs when, for the life of me, I hadn't heard anything funny.
Acting was way over the top. I truly found this show awful!",1486166400,,249,4.319148936170213
8580756,1,B00CEB72WW,Too predictable to be funny. Come on Great Britain you can do better.,1485820800,,69,4.384615384615385
