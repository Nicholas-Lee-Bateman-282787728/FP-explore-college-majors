2875993,4,B000RXZIKW,I enjoyed this version of Little Women because it adhered very closely to the novel. I found the casting believable and hence excellent choices. It is always good to see how each character is presented and I was happy with this - Although it is not my favorite rendition.,1197417600,8,271,4.551020408163265
2875994,4,B000RXZIKW,"I remember seeing this when it aired on TV lo so many years ago, and am very happy that it is now available on DVD.

There are many things to recommend about this production; first of all, Susan Dey as Jo. Physically, she's closer to the vivid description Alcott herself gives us (tall, long-limbed, round-shouldered, and awkward) than is Wynona Ryder--much as I admire Ryder's performance, her petiteness keeps me from truly seeing the Jo March I imagined as a child. Dey is also by turns funny, tender, fiery, and poignant. Meredith Baxter-Birney is an appropriately pretty Meg, and portrays the character's little vanities while retaining her essential appeal. As gentle Beth, Eve Plumb is surprisingly affecting, particularly in her final scene with Jo at the seaside. As for Ann Dusenberry...one wishes they had cast a true 12-year-old for the young Amy, as Dusenberry's valiant attempt to play young unfortunately results in an overly-petulant Shirley Temple. Her grown-up Amy is the least satisfying protrayal of the four sisters.

Richard Gilliland's Laurie seems too modern and all-American for a character who was reared and educated in Europe. Cliff Potts, on the other hand, is a good Brooke, upright without being stuffy. William Shatner's customary hammy style somehow works for Professor Bhaer, but his German accent is unconvincing, to say the least.

Of the ""veterans"", Greer Garson stands out for her memorable Aunt March: no crusty, bad-humored fossil of a woman is she, but an elegantly overblown product of her era and upbringing, with foreshadowings of Wilde's Lady Bracknell. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Young as Marmee and Mr. Laurence turn in solid, intelligent performances.

My biggest gripes are the non-period turns of phrase in the script, the non-period character shoes (WHITE ones, yet!) on all the sisters (Edith Head, what were you thinking???), and the blatantly non-period music Laurie bashes out on the piano, which sounds closer to Andrew Lloyd-Webber than Beethoven. Amy's wigs are interesting, as well...

Of course, the  time constraints of television necessitates a cut-and-paste version of this long novel, but the overall construction of the script is quite satisfying. Hopefully there will be an adaption in future which puts Laurie's proposal to Jo in its proper place, which is AFTER she comes back from New York, but before he goes back to Europe.

Despite the above-mentioned flaws, this is a DVD well worth purchasing and recommending to any fan of Alcott's beloved classic.",1194739200,34,2523,5.214814814814815
2875995,2,B000RXZIKW,"I remember watching this on TV and thinking how good it was.  I was disappointed when I rewatched it.  It's ok, but the newer versions and especially the older (B&W) versions are much better.",1194048000,3,191,4.588235294117647
2875996,4,B000RXZIKW,"I have four versions of ""Little Women"", all of the American versions, and if I had to rate each of them in order 1 to 4, I would rate them just as they came out.  The first is by all means still the best!  This one rates third to me, but unlike the last one with Winona Ryder, I really like this one.  I remember seeing this one when it aired on television as a mini-series, I really enjoyed it, and I like the cast, but I'm not real crazy about Merideth Baxter Berney as Meg.  I like her as an actress, just not in this role, she's pale compared to the first two.  My major complaint about the more recent ones is that the directors don't really seem to understand the era the book is about, just like the passage of time, they are further removed, they get a little contemporary.  As I mentioned, I don't like the Ryder version, it has nothing to do with her, I just don't like the directing, it seems like all the actors just stand around waiting for someone to give them their next line, it doesn't flow.  This one lacks a little in flow as well, but not that bad, but there are a lot of elements missing here from the earlier versions, particularly the play, and you also never see Jo ""burn her frocks"", nice little details a good director throws in.  This one gets a little comtemporary, but overall it is well cast and good, just not great.  All just my opinion! By the way, Susan Dey is a great Jo!",1194048000,8,1406,4.158671586715867
2875997,4,B000RXZIKW,"This version of Little women is the closest to the actual book of all the rest.  Kate Hepburns version is the best movie version, June Allyson's is possibly the worst in terms of cast.  This version takes its time and explores the March families relationships.  This version also includes Jo and Beth's trip to the seaside for Bethy's health.  All other versions skip over this small but important scene.  The series is well cast, with not a bit of ""PC"" propaganda in sight.  Thank heavens!  I would definately recommend this version of ""Little Women"" to all who loved the book.  And I agree anyone who does not weep when Beth dies is heartless!",1193875200,7,645,4.646017699115045
2875998,5,B000RXZIKW,What a treat to have this version on DVD. My sisters and I used to watch this over and over again on VHS after mom recorded it when we were kids.

2875999,5,B000RXZIKW,At last The TV Mini Serize of Little Women is finally available here in the USA and although there are other versions out there ; this is one of the best . All the girls are wonderful as the sisters; but Dey is one of the best Jo holding her own with Hepburn and Allison.  The real treat is Greer Garson as Aunt March ; Robert Young as old Mr. Lawrence and Dorothy McGuire as Marmee. They are three stars from the Golden Years of Hollywood who make this an A list movie.

2876005,5,B000RXZIKW,"My family and I really like this version of Little Women. The acting is wonderful. I believe I like this version better than the original (one with K. Hepburn and the other with J. Allyson). Jo's character wasn't as overly demonstrative as she was in the two earlier versions. I never saw the 1994 version, so can't compare to that, but this version is wonderful. Eve Plumb did a fantastic job as Beth. Her talent is obvious. She's a much underrated actress.",1468972800,3,458,4.597560975609756

2876016,3,B000RXZIKW,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of acting by Susan Dey in the role of Jo. I had expected quality performances from Meredith Baxter Birney, Dorothy McGuire, and Greer Garson, which they delivered. Another pleasant surprise was Eve Plumb as Beth. Unfortunately, Ann Dusenberry as Amy merely annoyed me. Casting William Shatner as Professor Bhaer was a horrible choice; neither his acting nor his accent was convincing. This TV version did keep true to the characters as portrayed in the book and even included Jo & Beth's trip to the beach. With its mixed bag of pros and cons, I'll give it 3 stars: okay, but not better than the old b&w versions.",1425772800,,655,4.754385964912281

2876024,5,B000RXZIKW,"I hadn't seen this movie since it was first on television so many, many years ago.  I enjoyed it very much, especially Susan Dey's portrayal of Jo...she was really perfection for the part.  I also enjoyed Dorothy Maguire as Marmee and Greer Garson as Aunt March...such excellent acting by all.  Eve Plumb was a beautiful Beth and, unlike some of the other reviews, I thought the actress who portrayed Amy was a sweet version along with Meredith B.B. as Meg.  Another aspect which I considered perfection were the costumes!!!  Oh, my, Edith Head as the designer...who needs to say more...they were beautifully done.  I would have preferred if some of the storylines hadn't been altered a bit, but it rarely happens that a movie is completely true to the book and this one was mostly on target.",1403654400,2,792,4.744525547445256

2876035,3,B000RXZIKW,"I'm always amazed at the number of writers who seem to think that they can write Little Women better than Louisa May Alcott did.  THERE IS NO NARRATIVE BY JO IN LITTLE WOMEN. It messes up the whole thing for true Little Women fans.  Amy is terribly miscast. This girl couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag and made no attempt to capture Amy as the character is written in the book. Entirely too coarse. Amy was very refined. This is a pretty good movie and the others cast are adequate.  Meridith Baxter makes a nice Meg.  Beth is too old and too big for the part but does it pretty well. She never looks as sick as she is supposed to be. Takes a while to get used to Susan Dey as Jo and if they were going to leave in the part about her getting her hair cut off then why didn't they give her really long hair as Jo actually had - and it was dark brown.  In at least one scene Meg calls her mother ""mother"" instead of Marmee. And, I wondered why not a soul involved in this movie caught that mistake. I was surprised to like Shatner in the role of the professor but his accent kept coming and going which is distracting.  He gave a fairly true sympathetic reading of the role. At least as any movie will ever allow since nobody apparently wants to show the professor as he really was in the book.  To me, Laurie will always be Peter Lawford.  This one pales by comparison. One question? If they were so poor why was the house so beautiful with apparently always new rugs, furnishings, paint on the walls, etc. Why was there so much wine drinking going on when this was the household of a minister and teetotaler? There were just a lot of little stupid things that mar the whole thing when it could have been a very good movie.  What this movie needed was a script closer to the book. As I said when reviewing that horrible Wynona Ryder version of this book, just go and get the June Allison movie.  It is just so much better. This one is just longer which apparently just gave them more time to screw around with the script.",1368662400,2,2030,4.182051282051282
2876036,5,B000RXZIKW,"I am a lover of this story from way back. I read the book as a child and had seen all the other versions of this story. I thought that I'd seen this one before, but it seemed new to me. I can't make it through Little Women without  crying and this version was no exception. I was pleasantly surprised because I suspected that my familiarity with the TV stars would be a turn-off for me. It's true that at first I was very put off by seeing these familiar stars in this classic. Meredith Baxter Birney as Meg? Meg was supposed to be a brunette. Also, I agree with another reviewer who wasn't happy with the long flowing hair on any of the girls. Jo let her hair hang down her back when she was being chased by Laurie in the other versions and was scolded for it by Meg. I felt as though Birney was taking a break from Family Ties or Family--she didn't look any different. But she grew on me. But another person to play Meg would have been ideal. Susan Dey did a competent job as Jo, but I still think Katherine Hepburn and June Allyson were both far more like the Jo I pictured when I read the book.

Robert Young did a wonderful job playing Laurie's grandfather. I thought it most appropriate for the screenplay writers to flesh out the story of Laurie and his grandfather. I was also pleased that this version included an episode from Meg's marriage. I found the story about his coat and her dress very touching. Part II or Good Wives or Little Wives as it's been dubbed had many wonderful stories and we lose out on those when the movie concentrates more on the early years.

I didn't fall in love with Eve Plumb as Beth. I enjoyed all the other Beths much more. The others seemed to embody both Beth's shyness and her saintliness--you found yourself loving Beth especially when she let love prevail over fear and embraced Laurie's grandfather when he gave her the piano. But this charming scene was left out in this version. And some of their Christian faith was left out. That beloved line which Beth used with Jo in the book and other versions of the movie, ""I think I shall be lonesome for you even in heaven"" was eliminated as were some of the other references to God and the hymn singing which should be part of any enactment of Little Women.

Amy was much better than some of the reviews promised. I thought she transitioned well from the child to the adult Amy, but I do agree that the writers changed Amy in this version. I really believe that they felt that one ultra-feminine young woman was enough (Meg) and so they made this Amy more outspoken. Amy would never have espoused feminist theories as this one did after the Susan B. Anthony lecture. Alcott's Amy was a traditional woman and reveled in her femininity. Nevertheless, I liked this Amy, and I felt that she was perfect for Laurie.

I loved Laurie! He seemed very much like the Laurie I pictured when I read the book--playful, exuberant, tender. I think William Shatner as Professor Bhaer is my least favorite of the actors who have played him. Perhaps I just kept thinking of Star Trek when I looked at him. He didn't seem much like a professor to me.

Dorothy McGuire as Marmee was wonderful. It was good that she talked about her own temper. I loved Susan Sarandon as Marmee in the 1994 version, but she never admitted to having a temper and come to think of it I don't think the other actresses who played Marmee did either. This new addition was certainly in keeping with Alcott's Marmee who did admit to having problems with controlling her temper.

The movie definitely grew on me because I noticed that for much of Part One I was critiquing the movie and feeling at odds with small details that didn't seem quite right--I didn't feel into it--and then towards the end of Part I and all through Part II I felt much more comfortable with the characters and I was rooting for them and crying with them. I was led to believe that they changed the rain to snow at the end when Jo and her professor meet. But there was plenty of rain before it started to snow. It was appropriate that the story was fleshed out a bit here and marriage was actually mentioned and that Jo actually gets to introduce her fiance to the family.

This is another version for my library which I will treasure. The colors and landscapes are just beautiful and the snow may be fake but it's lovely! And most of the time I didn't find the violin music intrusive--sometimes I found it soothing. Great movie!",1367625600,6,4453,4.408759124087592

2876047,5,B000RXZIKW,"What makes this version the best is how closely aligned the characters are with the book.  The Hepburn/Taylor version goes awry when they adjusted the character roles to accommodate the big names playing them.  Too much focus was ill-placed which threw that movie off balance.  In the Sarandon/Ryder version too many liberties were taken to try to ""update"" this classic Alcott tale.

This Dey/McGuire/Plumb/Baxter version seems to step right out of the pages of the book.  It's fresh, genuine, and the actresses do a great job.  Susan Dey captures the essence of Jo to a ""T.""  The March family home is full of charm and the rest of the cinematography is a feast for an Alcott lover's eyes.  Love this movie!!!",1336694400,10,709,4.801652892561983
2876048,3,B000RXZIKW,"I remember thinking when this aired that it was not a bad version, although I've never been satisfied with any of the adaptations. This 1970s version is clearly 70s vintage: the look, the music, the way the girls wander about, just like in LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, with their hair streaming down their backs instead of in braids, or braided and coiled when older. (Speaking of hair, why does Jo's never grow back?) Events that happen singly in the book are doubled up in the miniseries, so that Jo's story publication, Marmee's letter saying Father is better, and Beth getting sick all happen pell-mell in a single scene; Meg's ""dressing up"" happens at the same party where Jo and Laurie first meet, and the news of Mr. March's illness arrives in summer rather than November, smack in the middle of Laurie's picnic, where Amy is suddenly old enough to be flirting with Fred Vaughn.

Little things are irritating: the March girls clearly wear 1970s rubber boots, lines are read in a stilted manner in many scenes, the house is much too upscale for the impoverished Marches. The opening 40 minutes of the story seem to take place in a couple of days immediately after Christmas, then suddenly it's two years later. The Hummels are added in as an afterthought just before Marmee leaves for Washington, DC, as the whole famous Yuletide opening of the story where the girls forgo their own gifts to buy ones for Marmee and then give up their breakfast for the poor Hummels, is completely omitted. The overwrought minute or two where everyone thinks Beth has died is a froth of tears and overly loud, irritatingly plaintive violin music. (And where the heck did Amy come from? Wasn't she sequestered at Aunt March's house?)

Worst of all is Ann Dusenberry, who begins to improve as Amy ages, but her portrayal of young Amy is startlingly bad. To play spoilt Amy in the earliest part of the story, she seems to spend almost every scene with her upper lip humped up like a disturbed rabbit. The literary Amy is a pest at that point, but Dusenberry turns her into a witch. You almost wish Jo and Laurie had let her drown. The later adult Amy returns to being very unpleasant. I couldn't put my finger on why she was so unlikeable in the first part, but by the second part I understood. In the book, Amy has her moments of brattiness, as when she burns Jo's manuscript, and silliness, when she uses ridiculous vocabulary to make herself sound older, but she is determined to be a well-bred lady and, as she ages, tries to cultivate herself that way, to be gracious and polite, with a soft voice and a pleasant manner. Dusenberry's Amy is, in Benjamin Franklin's words in 1776, a Boston fishwife. Her diction is often coarse and loud. And she's still doing that rabbit thing with her upper lip.

The brightest spot in the story is Greer Garson as Aunt March. She plays the imperious old woman for all she's worth. Dorothy Maguire is a perfect Marmee and Robert Young is very charming as Mr.  Laurence. Susan Dey really did do a nice job as Jo, and in this version they did show the affecting sequence where Jo takes Beth to the seashore, which played very well.

Many people love this version because they show some of the scenes that are usually left out of the other films for time, like the seashore sequence. This version also includes the episode where Meg pays $50 for silk material for a dress and then sends it back so John can buy a new overcoat. In the book, this is part of a longer sequence where Meg has to adhere to a budget and complains to John about being poor, but all that is omitted, so the dress/overcoat sequence has little meaning. In another interesting sequence not in the book, Mr. March and John Brooke salute the birth of the twins with wine. Except it's very clear in the book that the Marches are teetotalers. Jo even makes Laurie promise not to drink at college.

William Shatner's Professor Bhaer is...interesting. He has the fun inherent in the part, and thankfully doesn't take Jo to the opera or kiss her on the neck; instead he tries to teach her German, as in the book (if later on they did climb trees together). But again, no one ever casts Bhaer as he is written, in his late thirties, already greying, stout, and with a beard, except for the very static and stagy British television production from the 1970s.

Amy and Laurie's romance is unbelievably truncated. Jo refuses Laurie's proposal, he goes to Europe. Amy finds out he is there and asks him to visit. He turns up, drunk, in her room the night before she is leaving, and she tells him off for his condition. He goes to Vienna to study music, realizes he hasn't the talent to be a composer, and returns to Amy when he learns of Beth's death. All of a sudden he is in love with her, she with him, with no chance to be together and fall in love as they do in the book, and they get married.

The miniseries moves full-circle and, as it concludes, once again it is Christmas. The ""under the umbrella"" scene with Jo and Professor Bhaer thus not only occurs at Christmas, but it quits raining and of course starts snowing (since it snows everywhere on television on Christmas Eve). Another clich&eacute; heard from.

There is one really odd thing about this version. In the book, two of Mr. Laurence's children are mentioned. One is a girl who died when she was young. It is her piano that is given to Beth. The other child is Laurie's father, who chafed under his father's strict ways, went to Italy, and married an Italian concert pianist. This is why he objected to Laurie's piano-playing. In this mini-series version, the daughter who loved music and died is combined as a character with Laurie's mother, who married an Italian concert pianist. Laurie tells Jo that his real name is ""Theodore Laurence Cerrito"" (I think that was the name) and his grandfather won't let him use it. Very strange!

Good points: Dey and the older members of the cast, scenes from the book not in other productions.

Bad points: 1970s production values, Ann Dusenberry, yet another ho-hum Laurie.

Summary: some very touching moments, but definitely not the best LITTLE WOMEN ever made.",1331251200,8,6156,4.591446769790719

2876053,5,B000RXZIKW,"As a fan of the book, I'll have to say that this movie does not disappoint in the story line.  I remembered watching this on television about 1979, and had hoped they would put this one out on DVD because I enjoyed it so then.  It is excellent for the entire family, and one doesn't have to have read the book to enjoy it (as one had to, to watch the movie that Winona Ryder starred in).  My husband even enjoyed this one.  If you are looking for a movie that even young children can watch, and one that you'll probably want to watch again, pick this one.  Susan Dey personifies the character ""Jo"".",1256169600,4,598,4.2105263157894735
2876054,3,B000RXZIKW,"Certainly not the best version, but if you are nostalgic, you may remember seeing this on tv once upon a time.  With Eve Plumb from the Brady Bunch as Beth and Susan Dey as a not so credible Jo, this tells the same story of Little Woman as the rest do.  William Shatner plays the Professor.

I recommend the version with Elizabeth Taylor as Amy and June Allyson as Jo.  The acting of all in that version is much more believable.",1243382400,,428,4.246913580246914

I'm French and I appreciated this adaptation of Little Women when I saw it in France few years ago.

Good film.

2876058,4,B000RXZIKW,"Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel is, in my opinion, one of the most difficult books to adapt to film. Much of the story revolves around inner struggles, which is hard to portray on screen, the period costumes are anything but simple, and besides this, a great deal of time transpires, so often the actors either look too old or too young for their parts. While this TV miniseries isn't perfect, I think that the filmmakers did an admirable job. The running time of a little over three hours gives the advantage of accuracy, without ever dragging. Even though certain portions were altered or cut out altogether, the script flowed naturally and presented many of the often overlooked facets to this lovely story. In my review here, I will attempt to report both the strengths and weaknesses of this movie.

On a positive note, the four March sisters are superb in their roles. Susan Day is the most human and real Jo I have seen so far, combining all the fiery temper, kindness and impetuous loyalty she possessed in the novel. Not only was Meg (Meredith Baxter) sufficiently pretty, but I was very much pleased to see her character given more development as she grew from girl to woman. Eve Plumb became everything I had ever pictured Beth to be and Ann Dusenberry's Amy grew on me, although she never became a favorite of mine. Altogether, I felt that this film captured the sisters dynamic well and gave each of them a chance to shine. The rest of the cast did a good job too, and I especially loved Greer Garson's proud and stuffy ""Aunt March"" and Richard Gilliland as the neighbor boy, Laurie. Speaking of Laurie, it was a delight to see the conflict between him and his grandfather included, which is usually glossed over. Other highlights are the beautiful sets, outdoor scenery, gorgeous costumes and especially the appropriate ending where Beth is remembered.

Now onto some of the flaws: as usual, the movie reflects the era in which it was filmed, which in this case is the 70s. My sister couldn't help but point out Laurie's plaid suit and the dated hairstyle. Speaking of hair, Jo's never seemed to grow back even as time passed, which I personally found a bit frustrating. Couldn't they have filmed the scenes at the end and the beginning while Susan Day had long hair, and then gradually cut it shorter as they got to the middle point where Jo sacrificed it for her family's sake? I also didn't care for the score (it wasn't subtle enough) and I hated the dramatic fade outs, which broke up the flow of the scenes. However, the age of the actors (particularly Laurie and Amy) at the start of the movie probably bothered me the most. They looked silly pretending to be younger than they were. This really cannot be helped though, and one of the reasons that ""Little Women"" is so hard to adapt is because so much time elapses with little physical change in the actors.

As a huge fan of Louisa May Alcott, I am always skeptical when I see a movie version of ""Little Women."" I know that the perfect adaptation of such a classic is probably impossible, but I honestly enjoyed this one. The acting was good; the material was handled with care, with a couple of allusions to Alcott's upbringing and time period. I couldn't help but overhear a bit of conversation between Mr. March and Mr. Brooke on transcendentalism and the allusion to women's rights after the civil war when the March girls, as well as Laurie and Mr. Brooke, go to see the feminist Susan B Anthony. Those little details showed me that the filmmakers cared about Alcott and sincerely did their best to honor her while bringing wholesome entertainment to the viewer. Because of that, I can wholeheartedly recommend this DVD!",1212969600,26,3700,4.663093415007657
2876059,4,B000RXZIKW,"I hadn't seen this back in the 1970s when I was growing up, but I would have loved watching it then because it had actresses from my favorite TV shows at the time (The Brady Bunch - Eve Plumb, The Partridge Family - Susan Day, Family - Meredith Baxter).  I enjoyed it the other night, and those actresses showed more acting talent than I was expecting. The sets were sometimes cheap (fake snow, etc.) and the newer version with Wynonna Ryder and Susan Sarandon was better produced, but a young girl would definately appreciate this one too.",1209427200,6,540,4.56701030927835

8202917,4,B000RXZIKW,"While I don't think anyone can play Jo March quite like Katharine Hepburn, I found this little gem at the library and thought I'd give it a chance. I am so pleased!  This is a lovely production!  I've always loved Meredith Baxter and I thought she was a lovely Meg, Dorothy McGuire was a loving and caring Marmee.  Robert Young was perfect casting as Mr. Lawrence and Eve Plumb was a sensational Beth. The Amy was lively and fun, although I don't know her from anything else.  Greer Garson is off-putting as Aunt March (who could top Edna May Oliver?).  The production design is marvelous and it's very faithful to the book, which is one of my favorites. (I taught it a couple of times).  Susan Dey is multi-layered as Jo, and her performance is the heart and center of this production.

The plot is completely disregarded, and character development is lacking. My sister and I watched it in fascinated horror and giggled over the stilted dialogue.
