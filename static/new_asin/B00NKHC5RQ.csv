6666149,3,B00NKHC5RQ,"If its too simple youve got no reason to try and if youve got no reason to try you dont. Wallace (Radcliffe) has just come out of a relationship and is forced to go to a party with his best friend and roommate. When he is there he meets his roommates cousin Chantry (Kazan) and the two immediately hit it off. At the end of the night Chantry gives him her number and then rushes in to see her boyfriend. Wallace decides to stay just friends with her but that doesnt really go has planned. I am not a huge fan of romantic comedies. I will admit that some are funny and aren't terrible to watch but for the most part they are just generic and full of fluff. Those movies are needed but they just aren't for me. This one is one of the rare exceptions where a romantic comedy actually contains something more than just surface feelings. This one feels more real and isn't the typical boy meets girl and they live happily ever after formula. This movie is more along the lines of 500 Days Of Summer, Spectacular Now or Gigantic. This is one of the few romantic comedies that I can recommend. Overall, not a typical date night movie, but still a good date movie. Much better than any Katherine Heigl rom-com. I give this a B.",1416700800,3,1219,4.2813852813852815
6666150,1,B00NKHC5RQ,"The problem here is quite simply, Daniel Radcliffe. Ever since the last wrap party for the last Harry Potter movie was held he has been running around like a cat with it's tail on fire trying to convince us that he can do - play- someone else.
Sadly for him so far the results have been zero. Nothing that he has appeared in has made the slightest impact at the box office and there has been no sign of him joining the A list of stars. What we have here is just another attempt by him to do some thing else - this time a comedy- to get from under the Potter character and again it has not worked and I fear nothing will.
It is always very,very difficult for child stars to cross the barrier to adult actors. What has made it virtually impossible for Radcliffe is the fact that he has become so associated with one particular role that audiences really do not want to see him in anything else glasses on or off. If he had been able to appear in other parts whilst doing the Potter movies it might,just might, have made his transition to an adult actor easier although,frankly I doubt it.
His acting range seems to be quite wide but he remains Harry Potter in style and mannerisms,a grown up Potter but...still.
He was amazingly lucky once,when he was chosen for the Potter role,and for that he should be very grateful; but as this latest film shows he needs to move on and use the cash he earned doing the Potter movies for some other career (behind the camera perhaps?) In the meantime he is wasting his previous youth trying to be the big, mature star he will never be. What do you bet that in the future if the Rowling's books are ever remade or musicalised  or whatever Radcliffe will be amongst the first to be consulted by the media?See what I mean?",1416009600,2,1754,4.315151515151515
6666151,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"What If Daniel Radcliffe took a break from the horror-thriller movies hes been making since his Harry Potter run ended and tried his hand at a romantic comedy? And what if he was paired with writer-actress Zoe Kazan (Ruby Sparks)? What would it take for good friends to move beyond that, without wrecking what they have? And without pushing the films rating into R territory? Thats the premise of What If, a PG-13 rated comedy-drama-romance that features intelligent writing, a believable chemistry between the slightly staid Wallace and borderline free spirit Chantry, and one close-your-eyes skinny-dipping moment that shows both actors bodies from behind in a moonlit (sorry, bad pun) long shot. Theres a meet-cute, certainly, but everything else takes a different route from the typical romantic comedy. Thats refreshing, especially since these two are moral individuals who care about each other, and the film emphasizes caring over romance, and romance over lust (which hardly makes an appearance).  While I wouldnt go so far as to call Radcliffes performance stellar, he holds his own as a newcomer to the genre and is helped considerably by having to react opposite the much more at ease Kazan. What If is actually the best post-Potter work Radcliffe has done, and who knows? What if he becomes more comfortable in the genre? What if he really finds his stride? Will this Brit take over where Hugh Grant left off?--FamilyHomeTheater.com",1416009600,3,1444,5.14468085106383
6666152,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"It's sad that this movie had a limited amount of air time and I don't recall seeing many commercial trailers for it either. My boyfriend and I had to travel into NYC to catch this movie as it was the closest available theater. With that being said, I adored the movie. I don't think they've could have done this better. The connection the two main characters have is apparent and well played out, you feel as though they are people you know in your everyday life. I've wanted to see this movie again so badly for months after it was over. So happy to see it coming out soon. I would deff recommend it.",1415664000,25,601,4.280701754385965
6666153,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"It is a complete shame that this movie saw such a limited release. I don't recall ever even seeing a trailer for it. I stumbled across it when I was ""wikipediaing"" Daniel Radcliffe, and gave it a shot.

This movie is brilliant. The dialogue is extremely witty, and I actually had to pause the movie several times because I was laughing so hard. If you prefer slapstick or more obvious humor, you probably won't dig this movie. Its humor is very dry and very sarcastic and very much all about clever banter.

Everybody in this movie is just so dang likable. And the chemistry between the two leads is almost tangible. It's so electric. When the two leads look at each other, you can almost SEE the curiosity behind their eyes. The casting was completely and utterly stellar. Daniel Radcliffe plays this very good-hearted, witty guy who may be a bit lonely. Zoe Kazan is an equally witty animator with a huge career jump on the rise, and who is happily in a relationship. When they meet at a party one night, they become friends -- only friends. But as they begin to hang out more and more, each has to confront the realization that their attraction to each other is becoming undeniable.

And it's not just the two leads that are amazing. The ""best friends"" are also very, very affable characters, who both have depth and are there for more than just to root the main characters on.

I suppose you could compare this to ""When Harry Met Sally"" if you wanted. But only in that it has the ""can a guy and girl be just friends"" premise. Other than that, this movie succeeds where I feel the former doesn't. Rom-Coms are so predictable and so eye-rollingly cheesy, and just so boring. This is not any of those. Yes, it ends the way we all want it to. But it's just so witty and the chemistry is just so explosive that you can't compare it to any other movie.

And, just as a side note, can I say how phenomenal is it is to have the girl-lead in the movie ACTUALLY HAVE A FREAKING STORYLINE? Most rom-coms are all about the guy, and the girl is just there to further the guy's story along. To ""save"" him and show him how great life REALLY is.  It's always some story about how the guy's storyline has him advancing career-wise, or about how the guy was just dumped and is depressed, while the girl comes along and shows him how to dance and bring life back in to him, or some crap like that. In most rom-coms, the girl is static, and is only there to advance the guy's story, and she really has no forward movement of her own character.  But this isn't that at all. Zoe's character has her own storyline completely independent of Daniel's character. And that is pretty amazing.

I don't know how many times during the movie I either whispered or even shouted, ""This movie is incredible..."" But, it is. It really is.",1415491200,11,2806,4.413926499032882
6666154,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"Zoe and Daniel have great chemistry and the supporting cast holds their own as well. The script falters due to its much maligned focus on scatological humour, which is a pity because the banter is otherwise dead-on. Also, for a film that does a fabulous job overcoming the standard rom-com cliches, the final moments seem tacked on by a meddling studio desperate to make the film appeal to Americans (film is a joint Canadian/Irish production). Finally, the name for international audiences, ""The F Word,"" is better than ""What If.""

I loved the Toronto setting, hated the low-brow moments. If the ""Elvis"" and ""Diner"" scenes had different dialogue, my review would be 4.5 stars. Instead I give it 3.5, but Amazon doesn't allow half ratings so I round it up to 4.",1413417600,3,761,4.809160305343512
6666155,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"I thought it was great movie. Daniel & Zoe have great chemistry, be it friendship or romantic. And I just love all the point of views present, as well as the dynamic of each character and what they added to Daniel & Zoe's relationship, which is at the center. Some perceive the very end to be slightly rushed, but in a time where movie endings are vague and open - ended, I liked it's epilogue typed ending.",1410825600,19,407,4.298701298701299
6666156,1,B00NKHC5RQ,"Can a hopeless (and broken) romantic settle for ""just friendship"" with a girl with whom he immediately hits it off even though she has a (very annoying) boyfriend? There is a very good reason ""What If"" is a limited release. First, you need to be a Daniel Radcliffe fan. Second, you need the stamina to listen to endless 20-somethings talking like ADHD teens hyped up on caffeine. Third, you have to like trite, mostly un-funny, jokes beginning with a long, drawn out, fast back and forth about feces and Elvis' discovery of Fool's Gold. Fourth, you must like Rom-Com's with characters that have absolutely no chemistry and you don't care whether or not they get together. Fifth, you like cartoon butterflies popping up. Sixth, you must love someone who scratches their fingernails on a chalk board. Finally, cute as this film may try to be, it is boring as hell for anyone except the target audience. The highest IMDb ratings are from those under age 18. Those over 30 need not apply because ""What If"" is a movie about kids for kids filled with conversations about feces that is an appropriate description for this jumbled-up play trying to be a movie with a predictable ending.",1410825600,16,1178,4.751219512195122
6666157,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"""What If"" (2013 Canadian-Irish co-production; 102 min.; original title ""The F Word"") is a rom-com that brings the story of Wallace (played by Daniel Radcliffe) and Chantry (played by Zoe Kazan), both in their mid/late-twenties. They meet at a party and talk to each other easily, and in fact hit it off nicely. There's just one problem: Chantry is in a 5 year relationship with Ben (played by Rafe Spall). In a parallel story line, we also meet Alan (played by Adam Driver) and his new girlfriend Nicole (played by McKenzie Davis), as well as Chantry's younger sister Dalia (played by Megan Park), who herself is recovering from a bad break-up. The only question really is: will Wallace and Chantry get together or not? Of course I'm not going to tell you, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, ""What If"" is directed by Canadian Michael Dowse, and he does a great job bringing this rom-com in a believable and enjoyable way. The movie is set mostly in Toronto, and Dowse takes full advantage of the great skyline and overall city that is Toronto (a small part of the movie is set in Dublin, Ireland). Second, the movie stands or falls with the chemistry between Radcliffe and Kazan, and fortunately they pull it off. It's great to see Radcliffe blossom in his post-Harry Potter career. Last year I saw him excel in an okay-but-not-great ""Kill Your Darlings"". Now this. You can see his confidence growing with each post-Harry Potter role he is taking on (he also stars in ""Horns"", due for release in a few months). As to Kazan (granddaughter of Eli Kazan, incidentally), I saw her shine in ""Ruby Sparks"", anther rom-com a few years ago, and with this movie she simply confirms all the good things, as she oozes charm from start to finish. But the movie almost gets stolen by Adam Driver, the wise-cracking nephew who zaps one-liners left and right, just hilarious. Last but not least, there is a varied soundtrack, with both a score brought by AC Newman (from the New Pornographers) and a bunch of great songs (from the likes of Haerts, Mark Knopfler, Rich Aucoin, the parting Gifts, Edward Sharpe, and others).

The movie came out some weeks ago here in Cincinnati on just 4 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The matinee showing where I saw this at was attended poorly (and I'm being mild), which is too bad. As it turns out, ""What If"" is a pleasant, if not very original, rom-com, carried on the shoulders of Radcliffe and Kazan's chemistry. If you are in the mood for something other than the latest Hollywood comic book hero action movie, ""What If"" may do just the trick for you. I'd suggest you check it out, be it in the theaters or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1410739200,30,2707,4.6375

6666165,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"Just discovered this movie in 2018 but it is officially my new favorite romantic comedy. Daniel Radcliffe turns in a very solid non-Potter performance here, but for me the Chantry character just steals the show. Zoe Kazan turns in an outstanding performance here. On the story, it's all just very believable, emotionally intelligent, and compelling all at once. Each of the characters are likable. Like one of the earlier reviews states, there is no real antagonist here, except for life  and love and their twists and turns. You won't regret this one.",1530662400,,552,5.0

And you hoped she would, and you never asked her out or told her your feelings because you wanted her to discover you and fall for you before you could feel safe confessing your feelings? But it never happened, right? Eventually you gave up and moved on? Well, welcome to the movie that asks ... WHAT IF she finally noticed you and fell for you?

GRRR. I kept screaming at the screen ... GET OUT!! LEAVE HER! Even though I knew how it would end, of course. A frustrating film that sends exactly the wrong message. For the sake of men and women everywhere, next time let's make it clear that the only way out of the friendzone is away from the object of your affection.

6666181,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"The first time I saw this movie, I kind of rolled my eyes at how precious it was.

It came out on cable and I watched. Then, I watched it the next day. Before I knew it, I'd seen this movie nearly every single day of the year -- no joke! Now I really like it. I'm so glad it's on Amazon Prime. Look, this movie won't change your life. It's not particularly poignant or anything. Zoe Kazan is still kind of annoying to me. And Daniel Radcliffe is only starting to look like an adult to me -- LOL! But as far as rom-coms go, this one is fairly cool, it's young, fresh, and stylish. I agree with some of the other reviews: the title is bland. But it's my understanding that this film was a play and this title is only what they're calling the film in the U.S. and Canada.

Radcliffe plays a medical school dropout, just burned badly by a relationship, and actively trying to avoid anything serious.  At a party hosted by his best friend Allan, he hits it off with Allan's cousin Chantry.  Chantry is engaged but seems open to a friendship.  Of course, the audience knows what dangerous ground this will be...

The movie is strongly cast.  Zoe Kazan holds her quirky own as Chantry opposite Wallace.  Adam Driver is terrifically over the top as Allan, and well suited to his off-beat lady love Nicole, well-played by McKenzie Park.  Megan Park has an important role as Chantry's sister Dalia, and Rafe Spall pulls off a difficult turn as Zoe's fianc Ben, whom we have to like, but not too much.  The dialogue generally works well.  If we all know how this has to end, we can appreciate the enthusiasm of the cast's delivery.  Well recommended as good entertainment.",1521504000,,1149,4.71859296482412

6666265,1,B00NKHC5RQ,"First let me say that there are two (2) ""What If"" films offered on Amazon Prime.  This ""What If"" film is NOT, let me repeat NOT, the romance starring Daniel Radcliffe, Mackenzie Davis, and Rafe Spall.  This ""What If"" stars Raymond Duval, Heather Gilliland, and Nick Corvello.  This particular ""What If"" does in no way resemble a romance.  It is an alleged ""psychological thriller following psychiatrist Ed Baxter on his journey towards schizophrenia as episodes of hallucinations and paranoia complicate his life.""  My review:  this has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Besides lousy, sophomoric acting, the plot is totally ridiculous...and I can say this as a psychiatric RN.  I keep asking myself, ""What If...I'd baked a batch of cookies, read a book to my son, called my mother, went grocery shopping, did anything rather than watch this useless movie?

Anyway, Ben Solo had Harry Potter act as HIS Best Man! Hell, he said they were like brothers!

6666323,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"It has been a long time since I have seen such a well formed romantic story. This movie benefits from a few things (1) a fresh and appealing cast; (2) a solid script that has actually thought about the little things that a happen in a courtship; and (3) good acting from all that ties the whole thing together.  This is the story of Wallace and Chantry. When they meet at a party there is instant chemistry but Chantry has a boyfriend. A good guy who she loves too. Wallace and Chantry just hang out a lot... and of course... fall in love.  Tricky to tackle is the issue of :what if: you are with someone who you love and just find someone you love more.  Zoe Kasden has a hard job of making a character that you can relate to who is essentially emotionally cheating on her boyfriend and lying to herself. Interesting and fun as well is that this story has no sex the entire courtship is emotional.  Too often poor romantic stories have to use the ""one night stand"" or other lame tropes to get their points across but this one is all about the friendship that turns into love.",1512777600,3,1076,4.285714285714286

6666369,3,B00NKHC5RQ,"AM not a Radcliffe fan so it surprised me that I didn't totally hate this movie.
The story isn't unique & yet it has the twist of being a bit retro in the main character's ideas of how a good person acts & what kind of person they want to be.
There were a number of times that the movie could have fallen into cliche` pot holes (or plot holes) and I really expected  it to, but surprisingly & happily it did not. The plot does revisit the whole :can a guy & a girl be just friends without wanting more issue, but it was refreshing to see a movie that had the main characters not using drunkenness,nakedness, loneliness, revenge or boredom  as an excuse to hook up.
I would have given it 4 stars but there were alot of dirty jokes, blunt crude bantering & then there was the naked swimming scene...too much visual ~
It's ironic that characters  in the movie engaged in casual sex yet it seemed that it was not proof of love....and 2 couples chose to solidify their couple ness by getting married.. so it was  commitment, not sex that really was the ultimate expression of love. Personally I was happy to see such an old fashioned idea part of the plot, because for me, it's the ""that's how you know"" that it's really love ending.",1498262400,,1228,4.303030303030303

Like so many other commentators notes, I found the witty banter to be very entertaining and it helped propel the movie from scene to scene because (except for the hilarious and unsuspecting scene where Ben gets knocked through the window) there is little action in the movie. The characters were very different from one another except the surprising similarities developed in the main characters, which spoke to me of the ""What If"" possibility that there was someone perfect out there for each of us.

6666415,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"This is a typical and predictable romantic comedy - but because it's done so well you won't care that it is.
Zoe nailed the ""girl next door"" in every way. So much that afterwards I looked to see what other movies she has done and will now watch those.
The animations in some of her scenes were a nice touch and I wish the director had added more.

Years ago I was in a similar situation with someone that was engaged to someone else and we had to just be friends - so a lot of the scenes I could relate to.

The movie doesn't try to change you, doesn't think outside of the box or break new ground and in my opinion didn't try to, it just made you feel good while watching.",1492473600,,673,4.014925373134329

Daniel Radcliffe speaks clever lines written by clever scriptwriters. But he also acts! He's a very good actor.

I've seen the Harry Potter movies but wasn't that impressed with any particular actor in them. This movie gave me a chance to see Daniel Radcliffe act as an adult in modern Toronto. As usual, when the drama centers around a group of friends, you wonder where they all find the time to interact. You wonder if Toronto is really as beautiful as it seems in films. You wonder if Daniel Radcliffe is this sweet and sincere in person - OK, I'm going to bet not, but close enough!",1492300800,,852,4.386075949367089

It's an absolutely cute RomCom flick, filled with lots of banter and just general good fun feelings. Sure it's predictable in places, all movies of this genre are. It's still worth watching. It's very charming, light hearted, and just over all a great movie to watch when you're looking for something to just chill and relax, either by yourself, or with that special someone for some light hearted romance and fun.",1492214400,2,580,4.81

On the other hand, a film with 20 characters all as smart as HAL 9000 gets a bit sardine-y -- lotta same as the other.  This film wore this flaw quiet well -- it was nowhere near as bad as Woody Allen's scripts where it is always Woody talking.

Great little love story.  Side story worked too.  3rd level characters were nicely sussed.

Tears, of course.  Gift of the Magi eat your heart out.  Jennifer Grey eat your heart out.  Woody......you should retire....ten films ago.  Ahhh, that felt good.

Future self -- probably you can just watch this anytime, but the longer you wait the better.....it won't age.....though you will.

6666424,3,B00NKHC5RQ,"A Radcliffe fan, looking forward to supporting work that could showcase his complexity as a character. I found female costar's character's complexity was not well-written. For having the anxiety of 'line-crossing' a historically significant source to her character would have made sense. Mom dying of cancer wasn't enough, given how minimally engaged, to frame her unwillingness to risk. His character, as well as his friends, were written far better. Further, that the main female character's sister did not pick up on subtle clues is more than a nod to poor character development--sisters can pick up on each other's subtleties. SPOILERS BELOW
Having said the aforementioned, the endearing moments were well done. The narrative 'ending where it began' worked. 'Allan' and 'Nicole' were beautifully written.

All of the acting is really great, and believable even if the movie becomes a little bit predictable. That's okay with me, sure the movie could become unpredictable, but do I really want a bunch of unpredictable movies with horrible endings where the guy never gets the girl (spoiler alert). No, I am okay with a well done, fun, and charming movie not being completely unpredictable. I think there are a lot of us that can really identify with the main characters, and I think those of us who do are probably the ones who enjoy this movie the most. They are intelligent and somewhere between social and antisocial young adults who aren't quite sure where there lives are going or even where they want their lives to go. But they are good people who want to do what is right in a world that often lacks their moral compass. Which is ultimately what makes a story of a boy and a girl trying to be just friends interesting. This movie probably isn't for everyone, and i'm not saying if you think this movie is bad or boring that you're unintelligent or emotionally shallow... but you might be.",1491868800,2,1216,4.433035714285714

It also has Star Wars's Kylo Ren, which I didn't even realize at first!!! This movie is FULL of laughs and a few more serious mixed in, but mostly fun and witty. I am in my 40's and a geeky gal, just so you know lol.

6666479,2,B00NKHC5RQ,"Set in Toronto, WHAT IF? centers on Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) who develops a close friendship with Chantry (Zoe Kazan), yet finds himself unable to fall in love with her due to her long-term relationship with boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall). Wallace and Chantry are thrown together a lot - especially when Ben takes a job in Dublin - and feelings develop between them. The rest, as they say, is history.

Michael Dowse's production has some sharp dialogue, especially involving Wallace and his best friend Allan (Adam Driver). Likewise Chantry develops a close relationship with her sister Dalia (Megan Park): Dalia at one point attempts a one-night stand with Wallace, but Wallace proves too enduringly attached to Chantry.

Daniel Radcliffe doesn't have to do much in the film, apart from adopting an endearingly hang-dog expression whenever circumstances conspire against him. Likewise Kazan has a limited range of facial expressions ranging from quizzical to slightly aggrieved. The stand- out characterization in the film is that of Driver, a tall, rangy young man with a taste for salty conversation who ends up ""settling down"" with Nicole (Mackenzie Davis).

The film is way too long - we end up yearning for the predictable end to take place - but the Toronto locations are atmospheric. WHAT IF? is one of those films that passes the time but nothing else.",1467590400,2,1360,5.089686098654709

So while everyone around him, including his roommate Allan (Adam Driver) seems to be finding the perfect partner (Mackenzie Davis), Wallace decides to put his love life on hold. It is then that he meets Chantry (Zoe Kazan) an animator who lives with her longtime boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall). Wallace and Chantry form an instant connection, striking up a close friendship. Still, there is no denying the chemistry between them, leading the pair to wonder, what if the love of your life is actually your best friend? Such an adorable and charming movie with a ton of very talented and charming actors. Daniel, Zoe and Adam are outstanding and you can't help but love them all. the ending is what it needed to be and that is okay with me.

It was predictable and easy to follow, and yet, despite those things, it was still very enjoyable for me because there was such a chemistry between the cast and the situations in it were so real that they were easily relatable. It wasn't like a lot of romance movies where things are so far fetched as to never even happen in real life, this one was a lot more down to earth, the characters were just average people, they weren't famous or rich or powerful or insanely beautiful, they were just ordinary people dealing with what happens when friendships start crossing boundaries, and that made it a lot easier to believe and follow.",1449014400,6,739,4.648854961832061

6666580,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"Lovely movie. Definitely worth watching if you want a feel good movie with some actual substance. The initial dialogue is a little forced, but the movie quickly hits its stride after the first 15 minutes. The characters are fully fleshed out and have both their positive and negative traits. The chemistry is great, not just between the main characters, but even the supporting cast. The storyline has elements of a classic romantic movie, but it's all presented in a very believable way. You can see yourself as either main character, the friends remind you of people you know, and you can imagine choosing between job opportunities and a boring stable relationship and a new exciting one. Daniel Radcliff is ADORABLE in this movie (though I've had a crush on him for a while). I'd never seen Zoe Kazan before and at first saw her as a less-than-beautiful actress, but by the end her line delivery and range of emotional expressions had me wishing I was her or that she was my best friend. Just a lovely movie. Very well done. Amazing caste, good plot, and SPOILER ALERT: it'll leave you feeling really happy.

I knew I couldn't get my money back, but at least I didn't waste anymore of my life on this horrible wreck of a ""movie"".
There was zero character development, but we're supposed to buy into the fact that these decidedly flat, fast talking uberly adorable(in the movie makers mind) people have an instant connection that can't be denied. WHY? There was no reason they clicked given to the audience.

6666674,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"What If asks the question can you be close friends with someone you meet of the opposite sex, if they are in a relationship with someone else? I mean who hasn't been there themselves? In the extras this movie is referred to by some obscure online entertainment show reporter as the F Word.  It's never explained in the extras why the movie changed its name to What If.  The F Word clearly is a more catchy title and better suits the storyline of the film, in fact I can't really work out what What If has to do with anything.  The F Word granted is the same name as a TV show with Gordon Ramsey in it but there's also been recent movies called What If as well so changing it for that reason doesn't really make sense.  You've got to wonder if this film missed out on the success it should have had due to the poor decision of a title.

But back to the movie, it's a pretty good one. Spoiler alert (but only if you're familiar with what other films I've reviewed), I was disappointed it followed a certain path for the ending, that's unfortunately what other movies on this topic have done too that I've also seen, (end of spoiler alert).

The characters are very likeable and there's little bits of humour thrown in every now and then, such as brilliant one involving a window and a door.  Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan play the very watchable and interesting to follow their lives leads of Wallace and Chantry, and unlike a lot of other buddy flicks type films, it's instantly believable that these two click as friends that are good close ones who can rely on each other.  Both characters are also ones you probably wouldn't mind hanging out with yourself. The side story characters (their other friends) are also quite interesting and keep the story moving along.",1428019200,,1760,4.461059190031152

I loved the friendship between the two main characters, and I also enjoyed their crazy friends which helped balance out how rather mundane the two leads were. At least in terms of their characters being less wild, and more cerebral. It had some good funny moments, and also some sweet moments.

6666771,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"Surprisingly... 'Thumbs Up' for this mild but refreshing indie!

Main ""Whys"":

1. I was happily impressed with this movie and all the the characters in it, from the great ""a**hole"" but genuine best friend to, and especially, our main male protagonist played by Daniel Radcliffe.  I like him as an actor and how varied his roles he takes now that he is grown are, but had, as yet, to see or be tempted to see more than ""My Boy Jack"" with him as a main character (mainly because ""Woman in Black"" scares the heck out of me- ANY scary film does). The straightforward conversations each has with their same-sex friend(s) are also not only enlightening but hopeful and add more depth to the characters than is usually given to, honestly, some of the more recently 'Blockbusters'.  I like foreign films more, perhaps for that very reason, whatever their net work at the US box office.

2. Both characters fight and argue and banter into serious topics, As I once read in a commentary for ""The Adjustment Bureau"" (the movie, not book), it was almost as if they fell in love with each other THROUGH poking fun at each other, which is funny and charming in its own way.  Though I was hesitant to rent this video, I ended up being happy I did, much because of this.  Let's just say, if you like ""Pride and Prejudice"" (Colin Firth version), "" The Adjustment Bureau"", or even so far as ""Cold Bodies, Warm Hearts"" (the BOOK- and, of-course, not counting the zombie-ocalyse theme), you'll love this movie.

Overall Rating: 4.5 Hearts

P.S.  <<< mini-SPOILER >>> It ended with a HEA, but not a typical, fall-into-insta-hearts, darn the consequences love story.  Instead, I loved that the characters, especially Zoe Kazan, played the role as cute, quirky, yet a struggle to be honest to others and ESPECIALLY yourself when the connection you feel with someone is so important to you.  << END SPOILER >>",1422230400,,1885,4.678787878787879

However, ""What If"" pulled off this plot and the indie-vibe so well that I couldn't help but feel charmed. I think the movie portrayed the complexities and uncertainty of human relationships, especially those that start off a little weird, very well. The obnoxious friend and his wife were a little over the top, but they kept the movie fun and spontaneous. The affectionate gestures and chemistry between the leads was undeniable. Over all, a good cute movie to snuggle up with.",1421712000,,602,4.742857142857143

And I disliked it way more than I anticipated, knowing that it was in the lexicon and attitudes of twentysomethings.

But I hated it. Maybe that's too strong,p. I saw that it was smart, that it wanted to let us know that it was smart, and hip, and cool. Every iota of energy in this movie as devoted to being ""cool"" and not the same-old.

Maybe it's generational - this film was arch, artificial and tried too hard to be cool.  But, for someone of my age, 60+, (but urbane), it was not geared to me. The rapid-paced dialogue was nothing that would come out of anyone's mouth but a hipster screenwriter writing cool characters. I appreciated that he (I assume it's a he, because I can't imagine a she would write so shallow) aimed for educated intelligent characters, but the artificiality of the dialogue was suffocating to me. Woody Allen was also artificial in his day, with jokey quips, but mostly his movies were inhabited by real people, not cool hipsters.

The actors were okay, for me it was the script. no character was believable, situations weren't believable, reactions weren't believable. I shut it off after half an hour.",1420329600,,1249,4.608108108108108

6666813,5,B00NKHC5RQ,"I was really skeptical of this movie. I expected Daniel Radcliffe to be typecast as Harry Potter, and Rom-Coms are pretty hit-and-miss in my opinion. However, Radcliffe's performance was excellent and I didn't get the ""Harry Potter sure is acting strange"" feeling. It felt like he was a different character, as it should have. The film was also really funny in my opinion. While the humor is a bit crass, it's just my style, and the dialogue feels genuine as if you're listening to real people talk to each other the way that they do. Add Radcliffe's and Kazan's deadpan delivery of their sarcastic comments to each other, and you get a charming movie.",1420156800,,652,4.728070175438597

This movie utilizes his comic talents well, and even had my husband laughing a lot  The entire cast was funny, and the situations made you remember how fraught being a 20-something trying to find that special ""one"" can be.

6666886,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"""What If"", is the first film where I viewed Daniel Radcliffe (portraying Wallace) as an actor; yep, the very first film. He is a well-intentioned, almost through with medical school dropout, looking for his place in the world after a really nasty breakup with girlfriend, Megan. An interesting movie, set in Canada, where we see the seasonal changes which are always so beautiful for me  (Rogier Stoffers) at times, especially during the Holidays, the starry nights and the beach at night. This is directed by Michael Dowse from the screenplay of Elan Mastai and based on the play, ""Toothpaste and Cigars"", by T.J. Dawe and Michael Rinaldi. I find the name of the play intriguing and tried to understand the screenplay being based on this title while viewing. It was inquisitive and I remained curious. A.C. Newman tracks a musical score that is quite original, adding life and flavor to the 'will they or won't they' theme going on between Wallace and Chantry (Zoe Kazan -  ""It's Complicated"", ""Ruby Sparks""). Can a man and a woman remain just friends? I, too, began thinking, ""When Harry Met Sally"", but those elements are not present here and this is totally different. I didn't feel that movie's trademark cynicism or banter but an almost confusing overflowing sweetness from Chantry leading to a friendship of mutual respect and a shared vision.

These two meet at a party without any personal living situations shared and begin a rather innocent friendship. No fireworks in a large display of their immediate spark which you can feel for yourself, but a slower, full of some very wacky conversation and a more fun way to get to know each other. Wallace and Chantry can talk about anything. She is a dreamer and a romantic. He is attracted to her, this is obvious. And there is a chemistry between them that feels genuine, just more at a leisurely pace that I appreciated.  When invited by her to come over for a meal along with her boyfriend of five years and her exuberant sister, he gets the door surprisingly opened by Ben (Rafe Spall) who instantly confuses - then suspects - Wallace's motives and why he's there in the first place. Is it to ""steal his girlfriend""? I Guess daydreamer Chantry forgot, yet again, to explain Wallace to Ben but not to sister Dalia (Megan Park). She begins tearing around the apartment trying to look intentionally attractive and available, she would love to have Wallace as her rebound between men. She does not have any problem 'acquiring parades of testosterone' in her life. Some pretty off the wall antics take place immediately upon Ben meeting Wallace. Apparently a serious white-collared Ben feels threatened and to be truthful, he is not even an unlikeable guy, he just seems to love Chantry in a very intellectual way where she truly seems to need starry nights, midnight talks and dreaming about life.

One of the very best features of this film is its supporting cast.  They serve to lift up the lead couple making the whole dance of a slow growing relationship that you may not always be sure of more fluid with generous doses of quite outlandish situations.  Aside from the oftentimes boneheaded Dalia is Wallace's best friend, Allan (Adam Driver), who is constantly full of his own sense of what stands for wisdom. His new fiance, Nicole (Mackenzie Davis), appears to perfectly compliment Allan and so much so that they cannot wait to join their lives together in marriage. I enjoyed this cast with their not always obvious antics which adds to this story between Wallace and Chantry - whose head may be somewhat in the clouds.

Along with much more to this movie, the question still remains even with their denial throughout; Will they or won't they get together? I't may not seem likely. Dreamers must dream, and at times out loud to someone who sincerely loves to hear their stories.",1418515200,8,3841,4.8090909090909095

I thoroughly enjoyed it as it had well-defined characters and portrayed the spirit of challenges common to relationships in the last few decades.  The characters and witty dialogue reminded me of my college-days bantering we did that were simultaneously competitive and bonding, but it managed to make me not feel old.  Most rom-coms I see these days not only make me feel old but make me grateful that I am.  I appreciate it when I see a movie that gives me credit for a few functioning brain cells.

6666945,3,B00NKHC5RQ,"This perfectly watchable film is also relatively forgettable. All of the actors are generally quite appealing, but the material is overly formulaic and at times quite limp.

Somehow while watching this movie I guessed that the budget was around $11 million and that, despite that modest budget, it hadn't cut a profit. I was right on both counts and watching it, I don't think it's hard to see how I guessed either detail.

For a rom-com to work, it needs to either be a little bit more innovative, feature funnier dialogue, or have more exciting chemistry between its stars.

""What if"" is a totally fine film to watch if you're looking for something light and romantic, but unfortunately is not a film that will fulfill you beyond killing 90 minutes of time.",1417478400,,759,4.734848484848484

Nope. It was as predictable as possible, but in the end it was worth the rental but I'm glad I didn't go to the movies for this one though.

You see a blossoming friendship and a connection that is there in the beginning but begins to solidify over time. Romantic Comedies always have trouble balancing the cute with the humor and the two of them do it superbly. If you want a movie that really doesn't seem to drag on, but actually develops the characters, their interactions and the endgame is not surprising than this is definitely a movie for you. 5 stars, I loved the pair of them in this movie and maybe we'll see them do another in the future.",1417132800,,664,4.450819672131147
6666982,4,B00NKHC5RQ,"I really liked this movie. It's probably more deserving of  3 stars but it felt greater than the sum of its parts. Meaning, there were things that could have been better such as Daniel Radcliffe's sister and son; neither really figuring out in the plot of the story, or how the end just sort of ""fell into place"" because it was clear they needed to end it. This probably could have been handled with a bit more grace but I bet someone was saying ""we have to keep this under x hours"" so let's wrap it up"".

Yet despite the flaws, I really liked/loved it. I loved the chemistry between the main characters. Their banter. There is a really nice scene on the beach between the female lead and her sister that goes to show not only does her sister have more personality than the movie lets on but that they have a good relationship.

The main female lead (Chantry) is an animator. At times there are animated depictions of her in the movie. On one hand this was nice but it felt like they could have removed it and the film would not have suffered. They should have just added more for flavor and perhaps more insight into what was going on in her mind. There is ""a thing"" in writing that if you can remove something or remove a character and it does't really affect the work then it should be removed. However, this was a nice touch and more could have been done with it.

If you want a decent Romantic Comedy with the type of ending that most people look for in a romantic comedy then this movie is one to see. It's certainly better than a lot of romantic comedies out there like the 21 dresses (or whatever it was called) or ""When it Rome"". which actually could have been better had better writers been involved.

In any case this movie is sweet, some funny/amusing/clever dialogue, enjoyable/likable characters and other than the rushed feeling of the ending should be one to see for those  who are a fan of this genre. As I said, I liked it so much despite its flaws that I purchased the DVD and felt compelled to write a review for others. since I never heard of this movie before I feel that ""spreading the word"" or at least giving someone who might like this type of movie a small nudge so they know to ""come in the water is fine"". Obviously it goes without saying that if you are on the fence regarding this genre then this movie isn't going to change your mind or give you some epiphany. If you are a bit of a romantic then it's well worth seeing.",1417046400,2,2452,4.296536796536796

I am not into glorified violence or torture or impressed in how many explosions happen per minute. I love the simple human interactions and flares of emotional energy that stay with you for the rest of your life.

Walking her home later that night, Wallace gets his hopes up when Chantry offers her number, so they can hang out again ... but also casually mentions that she lives with her long-term boyfriend of five years, Ben (Rafe Spall).  With even his best friend (Adam Driver) finding romance, Wallace's loneliness is offset only by what turns out to be an amazing friendship with Chantry, the two having so much in common - but can a best-friendship between a man and woman remain just a friendship?  The answer is not as predictable as you'd expect, and the chemistry between Radcliffe and Kazan sparkles on-screen in this sweet, funny rom-com.",1416873600,2,966,4.807228915662651
