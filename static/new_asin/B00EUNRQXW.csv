8609609,4,B00EUNRQXW,"This is possibly one of the best family/business dramas ever made. The cast is superb. These are the stars one loves to hate. These are the stars one loves to love. I can't say enough about the twisting plot or horrific mothers-in law portrayed in this story. It is just great. I am so glad I decided to purchase it. It is 50 episodes of never ending drama, screaming, crying, laughing, singing, and all around great family drama. Makes ones mouth water for noodles!",1453852800,,466,4.559523809523809
8609610,5,B00EUNRQXW,"I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE BUT THE COPY I RECEIVED DID NOT HAVE THE NORMAL MOVIE MENU . IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A BOOTLEGGED COPY .THERE WERE NO PREVIEWS OF OTHER MOVIES . NO SET UP OPTIONS . NOTHING . WHEN THE MOVIE STARTS IT JUST SHOWS PICTURES OF CHAPTERS AND A BUTTON THAT SAYS ""PLAY ALL"".  THE PICTURE IS A LITTLE OFF COMPARED TO OTHER KOREAN DRAMAS I HAVE PURCHASED ALSO . THE ONLY TIME I HAVE SEEN THIS FORMAT WAS IN COPIES OF MOVIES MADE FROM THE ORIGINAL DISC . I COULD BE WRONG BUT I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A MOVIE THAT CLAIMED TO BE NEW , FACTORY SEALED MOVIES COME LIKE THIS .",1438732800,,583,3.940677966101695

8609613,3,B00EUNRQXW,"This is a typical Korean melodrama.  If you've seen one, you've seen most.  What's unique about this one is that it's 50 episodes long.  It's like the K-drama version of running a marathon!  It's like getting hit with wave after wave of emotional ups and downs.  The series has everything.  Crazy mother-in-laws, mama's boy losers, crazy unlikable family members, amnesia, sickness, death of loved one, and complicated love triangles... the list goes on and on.  Wow...

So here it goes.  I'll try not to spoil anything major.  I'm not all that sure about spelling of their names.

1. Chae Won (main girl) - Your typical nice girl who doesn't speak up.  You can write a book about everything that happens to her.  Well, they made a show out of it instead, I guess. She, herself, wonders why these things are happening.  Well, mainly because she doesn't stand up for herself for the longest time.  She changes later but even then she does it selectively.  Probably to advance the plot.  But she's likable because she's just so nice.

2. Se Yeon (main guy) - He seems somewhat normal.  He's trying to get over his dead girlfriend (fiance).  Really nice guy and thankfully, he's not a mama's boy.  So that's a big plus.  I think he's the most normal of the bunch.

3. Cheol Gyu (Chae Won's ex husband) - A big time mama's boy.  Even he knows about it, himself!  He's violent and drinks a lot.  The house is full of liquor.  Every episode shows him emptying at least 2 bottles of whatever.  And then, he's got more the next day!  You do feel sorry for him, though.  It has to be so exhausting being him with his crazy mother and sister.  He continues to haunt Chae Won even after their divorce.

4. Chae Won's family - The main reason why there are 50 episodes, I think.  The secondary plot line involving this family is so silly and uninteresting.  The family is full of unlikable characters.  All women are gossiping despicable human beings who are hateful.  All men are either mama's boys or losers.  This is no joke.  This makes the whole plot line involving the family just dumb and silly.  We started skipping about half way through the series.  Also, Chae Won's dad comes across as an old country boy but it's so overdone, it's not even remotely believable.

5. The parents - I don't know what the deal is with Korean old ladies.  They are portrayed as controlling and manipulative and unforgiving of their daughter in laws. It's like an unwritten rule over there.  Mother-in-laws must hate their daughter-in-laws and make their lives living hell.  All mothers want their sons to be mama's boys.

6. Women in general - They're either seen as weak and indecisive or just evil and jealous and vicious.  This made my wife pretty upset.

The villains of the series do some pretty illegal things.  But nobody faces any consequences what so ever.  If I did half of these things, I'd be in jail for at least 10 years.

Like I said, it's a typical K-drama.  So we know being frustrated comes with the territory.  The story advances mainly because nobody speaks the truth until it's too late.  People don't stand up for themselves.  They get accused of horrific things but none of the conversation ever gets interrupted.  The characters continue to repeat things like ""Don't you think it's too much?""  or ""How can you do such thing?"" or they have a blank look on their faces while things are said about them.  Just spit it out!  Go ahead and tell the whole story!  But instead they say ""I'll let you know later when I have it all settled.""

I brought up mostly negative points but we did watch the whole series. Why? It's just so addicting.  I do like the main story line and the main characters (CW & SY) make you want to root for them. You want to know what happens.  They make the last 15 minutes of every episode so interesting.. then it's over so you just have to watch the next one... it continues on.

So if you think you're ready for a grueling 50 episode of this, go ahead and see what happens!  Happy watching!",1404086400,2,4014,4.518156424581005
8609614,4,B00EUNRQXW,"Korean TV dramas are usually centered around certain cultural/dramatic givens: Handsome Rich Guy loves Beautiful Poor Girl. As the pair attempt to marry, their respective families intrude, often led by a stern matriarch who is punishingly intent on preventing this marriage. Along the way, the viewer is presented with an ongoing examination often didactically with the subtle nuances of family, culture, and filial obligation among a wide variety of assorted aunts, uncles, mothers, fathers, siblings, and in laws. In A HUNDRED YEAR'S INHERITANCE, all the above are interlocked in a moving drama about a noodle company in Korea that is fast approaching its 100 years of existence. Its patriarch is elderly and upset that none of his children care enough about tradition to take over after his looming demise. The plot driver is about how he manages to deceive them into getting involved in maintaining the very existence of the company. Romantic conflict abounds. The Handsome Rich Guy has suffered silently since his wife died in a car accident. Unbeknownst to him, his late wife's best friend has loved him with an obsessive passion. Parallel with this is the Beautiful Poor Girl who is stuck in a miserable marriage with a brutishly violent mother-in-law whose son is a total wimp who cannot appreciate his lovely and sweet wife. Other parallel romantic conflicts are in evidence, the most interesting one between a thirty something daughter of the patriarch who inexplicably falls for a sixty year old crooner. Finally there is an improbably melodramatic tale of two women who give birth to two boys, with one of them switching her own dead child for the other's live one. What all of these conflicts share is that at the heart of each one cast member has seriously hurt another with lasting psychological damage. All concerned take turn with unending requests for forgiveness but are somehow dumbfounded to learn that this forgiveness is not granted until each one takes responsibility for their actions. It is too easy to say ""Sorry"" but more difficult to prove it. Actions do speak louder than words and until deeds equate with words, hurts do not heal.

I do not give this film five stars even though the plot/cultural matrix grabs the viewer during all fifty episodes. What I found unsettling was the omnipresent use of vaudeville based schemes whose comedic exploits distracted from what was supposed to be a serious drama. Consider the following partial list of distractions: rampant coincidental meetings of cast at critical junctures, tripping and falling of potential lovers with the male somehow winding up lying prone over the female in a compromising position, lovers mugging for the camera in a way that would make a high school film director cringe, and excessive scenes of weeping by everyone whose purpose it is to engage the viewer to do likewise. Still A HUNDRED YEAR'S INHERITANCE does what it does despite (or because of--I'm not quite sure) such heavy-handed antics. It is not a great drama but since such films are enormously popular in Korea, perhaps to a westerner such as myself, I am being overly nitpicky. This series is worth watching.",1403827200,,3169,5.036190476190476
