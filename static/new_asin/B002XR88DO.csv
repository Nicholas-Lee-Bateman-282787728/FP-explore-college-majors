8383809,4,B002XR88DO,"The Brain in Love is a very interesting dvd and my boyfriend and I learned alot while watching it. After awhile though it got to be kind of to much for me. Brain talk was to much for me for some reason,so this a dvd I won't be watching very often though it is a very,very helpful movie to watch with your partner. He showed different pictures of different people's brain's and the story of their lives which was very helpful and he also mentions foods that can help to improve your love life.",1421020800,,492,4.24468085106383

8383811,5,B002XR88DO,"Through his research and study of many brain scans, Amen presents a science-based explanation of why some relationships don't work out, while others seem a match made in heaven. Understanding the effects of brain dysfunction as a result of disease or injury helped me let go of the guilt associated with a difficult marriage. Revealing graphics depicting damaged vs. healthy brains was a real wake-up to the devastating relational effects of brain injury. Understanding that a parent's constant, frightening rage may simply be the result of a high school football injury relieves the strain on family relationships, while arming the receiver of that rage with self-confidence and a path to treatment. Amen is an entertaining lecturer who listens deeply to audience questions, and responds with great insight. With much to learn, I will be watching this DVD again and again.",1391731200,,873,5.242857142857143
