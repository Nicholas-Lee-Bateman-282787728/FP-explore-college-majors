8407352,1,B003WKK0DM,This movie is a complete waste; not sure how to categorize it because it is definitely not a thriller or horror or suspense for that matter.  The plot and everything about it mediocre at best.,1371772800,,192,4.485714285714286
8407353,1,B003WKK0DM,"From the beginning of the film the acting just made me cringe. The older brother seemed to be the best out of the whole cast, and I didn't see him very much. The only plus was the price, and with that I suppose I should expect to get what I pay for. Every now and then though you will get lucky and find a decent movie for less than 20 bucks. This one is not in that category, but if you have watched everything there is, it cant hurt to waste a couple hours on. Just find it at redbox and get a cheap case of beer with the rest of your money.",1328313600,,543,3.814159292035398
8407354,4,B003WKK0DM,"""I love independent horror movies but lately got a bit tired of slashers. I noticed Twisted Path's trailer on YouTube, got curious, read some reviews and decided to check it out.
Here are my thoughts after watching it: the first thing I noticed (like in the trailer) are good photography and cool locations. I thought the beginning was a bit too slow, but over all I found Twisted Path pretty entertaining. I thought the movie had a good twist at the end, but what I liked the most about it was the subject, which touches something I personally experienced and can relate to. Besides the subtitles, the Blu-ray doesn't have any extra features, but sound and picture are good quality.""",1295222400,3,684,4.708333333333333
8407355,2,B003WKK0DM,"What could have been a good movie you can't tell,because it was over edited. So sometimes you don't understand what's going on. You know, plot, character connection,Etc....However good acting by a cast of unknowns. Bravo",1284508800,,220,5.314285714285714
8407356,5,B003WKK0DM,"Twisted Path is a psychological thriller with several cool bloody scenes. I like horror movies that make me think and in that respect Twisted Path didn't disappoint. The pace is slow in the beginning and builds up toward the middle. The ""who done it"" theme is predominant and there's a twist at the end. The Blu-ray quality is not disappointing. The photography is very good... images, colors, details and atmosphere are amazing. The music score is also very good. I thought script and dialog could have been stronger, but over all I enjoyed the movie and I'm happy to have it in my collection. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the Blu-ray comes with no extra features.",1284076800,3,671,4.6
8407357,5,B003WKK0DM,"Wow.  Just when I thought I knew what was going on, it totally screwed with my head.  It reminded me of M Night Shyamalan's best movie, The Sixth Sense.  I thought it was going to be a straight horror movie, but it's more of a thriller.  It reminded me of The Cube, which was another good independent movie with no-name actors.  The actors aren't great, but it was nice to see some parts of Italy, and to hear Italian.  It's an unusual combination of urban thriller and foreign film.  I was intrigued by the fact that this was a blu-ray only release, and it did not disappoint visually.  I highly recommend this movie for people bored with the usual Hollywood stuff who are looking for a subtle, moody, slow-paced psychological thriller.",1281830400,3,737,4.572519083969466
