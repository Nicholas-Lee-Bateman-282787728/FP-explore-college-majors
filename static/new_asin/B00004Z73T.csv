It's in three segments of only 10 minutes, which means you can workout for as long as you want (10,20, or 30 minutes).  You really feel good afterwards, and you can see the results.  I really like the first two segments (a normal aerobics and a kickboxing segment), which have great instructors who really show you how to do each movement, how to be careful so you don't hurt yourself, etc.
However, the last segment isn't as good.  The instructions aren't as clear and she doesn't give you any advance warning about when to switch movements.  The third segment is also just not as fun as the first two.
The first segment, taught by Mina Lessig was so good, I've bought three more of her videos.  Her other videos are longer and slightly more advanced, but with the same careful guidance that I like.
Overall, it is definitely worth the price, especially if you are pressed for time, or are just beginning and aren't ready for a full 45 minute workout.",984960000,8,1045,4.502645502645502
1383487,5,B00004Z73T,"I am a busy professional with a fulltime job, three girls, three dogs, am a Brownie leader and volunteer with two organizations each week.  I needed the Quick Fix.  That's why I bought this video.  It is everything it promises.  I got to all my important body parts within a short period of time (and my body parts are looking better).  It made it possible to squeeze exercise (toning) into each day.  Sometimes before work, before dinner or when things quiet down in the evening.  Give it a try.  Its your best shot towards fitness in a busy world.",984009600,6,549,4.474747474747475
7928307,5,B00004Z73T,"I love this workout!  Fun and easy, but not too easy.  I enjoy the trainers as well.  Feel good about only doing ten minutes.",1150329600,,125,4.125
7928308,3,B00004Z73T,"I just did this yesterday for the first time.  I can feel it in my thighs the most . The tape is a series of three 10 Min. workouts designed to be done together or separately.  I fail to see how 10 min. can be a truly complete workout but, all things considered, I think they did a pretty good job of making it count.

The first 10 min. is a workout w/ weights, which I enjoyed.  It was a little challenging at times.  The second set is sort of styled after kickboxing but the moves are slow and more precise.  I think that this is good and more effective for targeting specific muscles. I know that other reviewers disagree.  The third section seemed like a bunch of repetitive lunges and jumps.  As another reviewer observed, this section is NOT for large breasted women. I wore a sports bra and I still found the jumps a little 'painful'.

Another thing I DIDNT like about this video was the instructors.  Crunch instructors are my favorite. I like their down-to-earth styles. These girls seemed like they are TRYING to be down-to-earth and TRYING to be friends but I found their unnecessary banter ANNOYING.

Nonetheless, I will probably put this tape in my 'rotation' for when I want something ""different"" and will just continue to do the first 20 min. of it.",1118188800,,1264,4.475982532751091
7928309,3,B00004Z73T,"I am adding this review for those who may want a 30 minute intermediate-advanced level workout that packs a punch for 30 entire minutes - this is NOT the workout for you.  I think this workout is good for those who are beginners. I am very time crunched and when I grab a video - I want to sweat and feel my heart pumping for 30 minutes straight.  I found this video wasted a lot of time.  The first 10 minute segment with Minna was the best - basic squats, lunges, calf raises, lateral raises with dumbbells. I increased my repetitions and managed to sweat.  I was disappointed with the next 10 minute segment which I thought would be some form of kickboxing. It wasn't - rather very slow stetching and some very basic but slow punches.  Honestly, I found it repetitive and I didn't get any exercise benefit out of it. Then on to the last 10 minute portion which was some basic cardio moves (very straightforward and again at a modest cardio level).  The intructor did a short plank pose, some modified push ups and a tiny bit of core work but no real abdominal work.  Overall, I thought too much time was spent stretching or on slowpaced exercises. If you are new to exercise or at a beginner level, you might enjoy this video. But, for the money, I would recommend I Want That Body by Tamilee Webb or Crunch Fitness's BootCamp Training - two workouts that will give you a start to finish intense workout.",1093392000,6,1407,4.409266409266409
7928310,4,B00004Z73T,"This is a very good, QUICK workout for toning.  Mina's segment is very good, especially for the arms.  The second one is alright, but I was looking forward to doing more moves than it uses...but what can you expect in 10 min?  I like the last segment, but parts of it are TOUGH--especially the jumping jacks if you have a large chest!  I can understand why some people complained about that segment!  Only one big complaint...only one of the workouts in my opinion had sufficient stretching at the end--you might want to add your own.",1090886400,3,534,4.578947368421052
7928311,5,B00004Z73T,"I love using this workout when I'm short on time (I do the whole 30 minutes). Recently, I grew EXTREMELY tired of my old routine and have ordered two of Minna's DVDs (which comprise of her entire video collection). While I'm waiting for them to arrive, though, I'm doing 30 mins of this video, followed with 10 mins of their Quick Fix Abs workout. It's always a great workout, and always gets my heart pumping. I personally think Julie Upton's segment is the best and most difficult, and you can tell that Minna and Nancy think so as well. This is definitely one of my best video buys.",1077235200,2,585,4.425925925925926
7928312,5,B00004Z73T,"I bought this tape about 6 months ago, but just recently started using it on a regular basis when I couldn't stand the flab anymore! I've been doing the entire tape every other day, and I must say I thoroughly enjoy it. I noticed a lot of people in the reviews liked Minna's first session the best, but I actually like the second 2 the best.  I enjoy a little kickboxing, and the fact that she slows it down makes the conditioning work even better.  The third segment does an amazing job on your arms. I can already see and feel a difference in my arms.  The plank is a killer! I started out only doing the plank for a few seconds, and now I have worked my way up to doing it almost the whole time she is talking. It's hard though! But MAX results!! I would definitely recommend this tape. Plus the quickness of the tape is a definite plus!",1070668800,,840,4.172839506172839
7928313,5,B00004Z73T,"I truly think that this series is the best bang for your buck, and for your time!  I purchased this tape, along with the  Quick Fix: Total Mix DVD after the birth of my second baby.  I've had them now for 8 months, and I still love and do each of them. Face it, anybody...even a working mom with young kids can make room in the day for 10-30 minutes of a workout!  This group leaves no room for excuses! And at less than $30.00 for both videos, there is not a gym anywhere that can beat the price!
Minna is definatly the Star, and she's a great motivator. Her workout is first, with a hand-weight routine that is easy to follow, but challenging.  Nancy follows with a kick-boxing inspired routine that works the shoulders, arms, butt, thigh, and abs. Julie is last and her workout is non-stop intensity!  When I finally mastered her killer plank pose, I felt like I should have gotten a trophy!  This video was created for muscle toning, but you really get your heart rate going if you do all three 10-minute segments!  This is a classy, well-made winner of a workout!",1046995200,3,1068,4.385786802030457
7928314,5,B00004Z73T,"I think this video is so fun and very effective.  Within about a month I noticed inches coming off and other people noticed, too.  I have a two-year old and a 5-month old and I always manage to do at least two workouts every day, and my exercising actually entertains them!  I feel stronger and have more energy.  Ten minutes can really make a difference and I like watching the clock....very motivating.
The first segment with Minna is the best...uses weights and works the whole body; the second has fun boxing moves and great bun & quadriceps exercises; the third one has a different style to it with lots of strengthening and stretching moves.  For each segment I find myself adding reps while the instructors are cuing and talking because I have the workouts practically memorized and that adds a little more challenge to them!",1036540800,3,832,4.710344827586207
7928315,5,B00004Z73T,"I LOVE this video!  It has been an integral part of my workout schedule because it's so little time involved for such a great, all-around workout.  The first 10-minute segment is a killer.  It's my favorite.  The second segment I don't really care for because I don't like the kick-boxing, Tae-Boe type workouts.  I have yet to make it to the third segment.  But I still gave this video a 5-star rating because the first segment is just THAT good.  I use this video in conjunction with the Quick-Fix Abs workout and it's made all the difference in the world for me.  I highly recommend this to anyone trying to lose weight (I've lost 40 lbs.) and tighten up the all-over jiggles.  :)",1007424000,6,683,4.487804878048781
7928316,5,B00004Z73T,"I work 40 hours a week, 2 teenage sons, husband, horses...no time for the gym.  This is a great way to get back on track! I get up a few minutes earlier, run through 1 set, then again in the evening and I have really felt a difference.  I came back to order the Quick Fix Abb workout, and the Arm and Leg work out.  I will alternate between the three.  I also ordered a copy of the ""Total Body"" for my mother, she loves it too.",985564800,,427,3.8735632183908044
