8378710,4,B002RF6L40,"If you lived in the San Francisco Bay area during the late 60's through early 80's and were a fan of Creature Features you need this!  If that's not the case you might still get a couple of chuckles but I'm afraid you won't really ""get it"".  Sort of like Herb Caen - either you know he was the greatest daily columnist of all time or you are clueless.  No in between.",1405555200,,367,4.069444444444445
8378711,5,B002RF6L40,"I grew up with Creature Double Features in a time where the local TV station Horror Hosts, still read fan mail and wished birthday salutations to kids from my own neighborhood.  Before there was cable, there were the BIG 3 and after that the local stations, stations that did not clutter the airwaves with infomercials, enter the Horror Host.  You do not need to be from the  Oakland, California area to appreciate this excellent documentary, you just need to have grown up in the 70's and have an appreciation for b-movie sci-fi and horror flicks and the hosts who delivered them to you every Saturday night, most likely, well past your bedtime.",1381968000,,646,4.75
8378712,3,B002RF6L40,"This is a good memento for those who remember Bob Wilkins on Creature Features during the 1970's.  It brought back many fond memories of watching the subtle but sardonic Wilkins on many a Saturday Night.  I was hoping that the theme song would be featured earlier in the DVD.  I was also hoping that they would show the clip of Bob (mockingly) crying at the conclusion of the cheapo classic ""Son of Godzilla""; still one of my favorite TV moments.  The theme song doesn't crop up until near the end of the program and the classic Godzilla clip is not included.  Maybe this can be found on Youtube.  Who knows?  You might want to check this out if you remember Creature Features and Bob Wilkins.",1287705600,3,693,4.496
8378713,5,B002RF6L40,"Saturday late nights with Bob Wilkins CREATURE FEATURES, spent more than a few watching in my teen years!  A mix of horror/sf films (good and really bad), interviews with a wide range of figures and old-time movie serial chapters!  A favorite show when they were growing up of Tom Hanks and George Lucas, a time gone by that will not be seen again.  I was never as fond of the show when Wilkins left though it continue for several years.  Loving tribute and look at a fond memory for many in Northern California. I remember a staged meeting between John Stanley and Stephen King.  Stanley sees King (who is wearing one of those ice-cream, Saturday Night suits) and says, ""Hey, aren't you Stephen King, the highest paid author in the world?"" ""Well, John, if I'm not, I ought to be!""",1267315200,4,781,4.55
8378714,4,B002RF6L40,"WATCH HORROR FILMS, KEEP AMERICA STRONG is a fine 75-minute documentary about CREATURE FEATURES, hosted by Bob Wilkins and John Stanley, a show that lasted 14 years on Channel 2 KTVU in the San Francisco-Bay Area. Plenty of vintage footage and interviews with Wilkins and Stanley. In the same 2-disc set is another excellent documentary, I WAS A TV HORROR HOST: THE JOHN STANLEY STORY, which takes a more personal point of view toward the history of CREATURE FEATURES, telling about how Wilkins rose up through the ranks and how Stanley came to replace him. The second disc also features comedy promotions featuring such icons as Leonard Nimoy, Chuck Norris and Buddy Ebsen. Three hours of important TV history.",1263686400,7,711,4.983193277310924
