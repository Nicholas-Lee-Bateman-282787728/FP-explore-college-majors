4331051,5,B004CZZZDQ,"We happened to catch this movie by accident on TCM. Really like William Holden so we thought we would give it a whirl.  Very sweet story, acting good.  Great family movie.  Good quality transfer. Would definitely recommend it.",1401840000,2,226,4.894736842105263
4331052,5,B004CZZZDQ,"Forget about William Holden, the barechested hunk in ""Picnic"", or the suave hustler of ""Sunset Boulevard"".  Meet an earlier avatar, with a flair for comedy, a great voice, and in a totally different role than those he was to play in later years.  Welcome to ""Father is a Bachelor"", which I ran to get as soon as I had finished watching it on TV.  Basically, Holden becomes the ""father"" of five orphaned children who are trying to make it on their own. Perfect for children of all ages--5 to 75!",1399680000,,494,4.466666666666667
4331053,5,B004CZZZDQ,"A great family movie. William Holden along with his partner are exposed. His partner is arrested. Holden gets away and stops and loafs near home of children trying to live on their own without people in the town knowing of their situation. Soon Holden gets caught up in taking care of these children, claiming to be a relative and handling the difficulties that arrive. If you are a William Holden fan this is a must see.",1388016000,2,421,4.552631578947368
4331054,5,B004CZZZDQ,"I love the story and the music.  William Holden was at his best.  Very cute, at times silly, but the music is great, not to mention the story.  Of another time, the good old days.",1385164800,,179,4.057142857142857
4331055,2,B004CZZZDQ,One of holdens early movies.  Theme of him helping family of children was tender and sweet.  Appealing to female audience!  The singing was too much.. Just wasn't believable!  Did mr. Holden actually sing in this role?,1379721600,,218,4.972222222222222
8424318,5,B004CZZZDQ,Had no idea William Holden had such a  great voice.  Surprised to see him in this venue.,1526688000,,88,4.117647058823529
8424319,5,B004CZZZDQ,"I got this movie from the library. It's a DVD-R, but ones from real studios, like Warner's or, in this case, Columbia, tend to play just fine. This is not the case with some made on demand DVD-Rs, especially from companies like Alpha Video. However, DVD-Rs from major studios, as with this movie, tend to have two options on the onscreen menu: play movie or play trailer. No extras. That said, I've found some of the best movies I've ever seen this way, which have never been put out as DVDs before.

When I brought this movie home, I looked it up, as is my wont, in Leonard Maltin's ""Classic Movie Guide"", which I highly recommend. He was somewhat dismissive, calling it a ""cute comedy"". However, I've learned how to read him, and from his brief review surmised that this was probably exactly the sort of movie I would like, and it was.

I'd say it's like an early Walt-era Disney movie, which I will watch anytime. I can imagine someone who likes the sort of new movies I find unwatchable might dismiss it as corny. However, movies like this date from what I call the magazine era, and if you watch the credits, many are inspired by a story in Collier's or The Saturday Evening Post. The credits for this movie include ""story by"" but don't name a magazine. This too, is par for the course, as many writers were hired by Hollywood for in-house scriptwriting.

Even a brief description of the story sounds like a Disney movie. A drifter comes across some orphans who will, of course, be hauled off to an orphanage if the fact becomes known, and he poses as their uncle. The story is told with subtle scenes, few words, and telling gestures, some of which are worthy of John Ford. This is from the days of black and white movies when you could be carried along in heartfelt scenes, moved with the characters towards the happy ending.

As another example, I got a movie from the library called ""Forty pounds of Trouble"". On the back it says it was the first movie filmed at Disneyland. It's in the Universal Vault Series, which means an old Universal Studios movie released as a DVD-R. This also played perfectly. Because of the Disneyland reference and, because when I glanced at the box I thought it said ""Vault Disney"" which was the name of a late night show a while back on the Disney Channel that aired Walt-era movies, I looked it up in my Leonard Maltin book of all the (early) Disney movies, and was surprised I couldn't find it. The reason? It wasn't a Disney movie. But it almost is. What's different? The pacing and editing. In this case, Leonard Maltin said it was a dead ringer for ""Little Miss Marker"", a Shirley Temple movie based on a Damon Runyon short story. Perhaps so, but in this case, there are thrill rides and chases galore through the early Disneyland, billed as ""the happiest place on earth"". That said, these are the happiest movies on earth.",1525910400,,2867,4.518304431599229
8424320,4,B004CZZZDQ,"What's this? William Holden starring in a comedy? And what's this? Holden crooning like Sinatra? Well, one of those is spot-on. The other, not so much. Holden's been in comedies before, the most celebrated being BORN YESTERDAY (1950) and SABRINA (1954). Never mind that my favorite rib-tickler of his is DEAR RUTH (1947). FATHER IS A BACHELOR (1950) isn't as well-heralded, and rightfully so. It's not nearly as good as those three other movies. It's not awful, though.

The plot: When Professor Mordecai Ford (Charles Winninger), snake oil vendor and front man of a traveling minstrel & medicine show, is arrested in a tiny Southern town and snags thirty days in stir, his right-hand-man Johnny Rutledge (Holden) whiles the time away by purchasing a boat and going fishing.

Johnny Rutledge, nowadays a fishing vagabond, is proudly a misogynist, claiming that the ""Prettiest girl in the world couldn't get me. I'm woman-proof."" He shirks responsibility. He puts up a cynical front. Except his second-rate attributes are put to the test once he runs into five orphaned children living by themselves in a ramshackle cabin by the river. The oldest kid confides to Rutledge of a letter received six months ago informing of their parents' passing. Only the two eldest children know this.

Suddenly, here's Rutledge getting sucked into the children's plight, sharing his catch of the day, buying them groceries, even trying to sew the little girl a new dress. The big softie!

3.5 out of 5 stars. FATHER IS A BACHELOR isn't quite one of Holden's best. It's missing that spark that would float it to the very top. I thought it may have held a singular point of interest in that Holden nicely croons several songs, but then I learned he was being dubbed by singer Buddy Clark. Still, Holden is a Hollywood star for a reason. He's a handsome and engaging hombre and knows how to deliver his lines. Watching the movie, I developed a crush on Coleen Gray who plays Prudence Millett, the judge's winsome daughter. Miss Millett is the sort of solicitous citizen who would drop by on children's homes because they've been skipping school. Luckily, Rutledge was around to ease her concerns.

There are some good bits in this movie: the orphan who can play Mozart on his harmonica; Rutledge trying to sew a little girl's dress from a pattern; the horseshoe contest between the two spinster sisters to see who would marry Rutledge; and, last but not least, Rutledge working as the Warbling Waiter.

Three of the orphans are memorable enough - the oldest and most responsible one, January (Gary Gray); the harmonica player, February (Billy Gray); and the youngest, May (Mary Jane Saunders). And, yes, all five kids were named after months of the year.

There are some neat life lesson moments that the movie handles deftly, such as Rutledge's thoughtful conversation with the runaway son of the local mean rich man he'd just had a run in with. And there's January's pithy rebuke when his siblings begin to grumble about their shabby wardrobe while on their way to school: ""You've got shoes, haven't you? Then you're rich enough."" And, while I know grown-ups aren't supposed to fight, especially in the presence of kids, I love that Rutledge braced that local mean rich man for calling the orphans ""river bottom trash.""

Charles Winninger isn't much onscreen, what with his charlatan character languishing behind bars for much of the movie. But when he does step in front of the camera, he's a funny cat. I dug his smooth salesman chatter as he pimps his meteria medica, this mythical panacea that he vows will eradicate an a broad catalogue of afflictions, be they shingles, jumping rheumatism, rasping croup, or blue chilblains. Snake oil makes for a hell of a cough syrup.

It's a decent time-waster. Holden, poaching in Bing Crosby's territory, does his best to put shine on a could've-been-better script, never mind that he'd been chafing under these kinds of lightweight, inconsequential films. Holden had been wanting to sink his teeth into meatier roles, a wish that would be granted with his very next movie, SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950). Coleen Gray is gorgeous. The kids are cool (my favorite is the no-efs-given harmonica kid). I soaked in the nostalgic turn-of-the-century feel and the sleepy Southern setting, and since the town is by the river, we get to occasionally eyeball a passing steamboat. Sweeeet. As mentioned, some shine does get taken away once you learn that Holden isn't the one actually singing. And, at some point, someone is gonna have to tell the three youngest kids that their mom and dad are dead, right?",1525824000,,4615,4.92159383033419
8424321,3,B004CZZZDQ,"After the medicine show is broken up by the sheriff, Johnny runs off and comes upon a cabin by the river, where five young children live by themselves. (Turns out their parents died in a river accident, and they exist hidden from society.) They slowly suck Uncle Johnny into taking care of them. He tangles with the richest man in town, falls in love with the judges daughter, but agrees to marry a rich spinster so he can better take carer of the kids. The first scene of this film finds Holden in black face singing as part of a medicine show. (It does get better from there.) In fact, Holden does a lot of singing in this filmat least his lips move to someone singing pretty well. He does well in the role, and the acting all around is well done. The story is engaging, the kids are cute, there are some truly funny scenes, and theres heartwarming sentiment throughout.  Not a great movie but a light diversion. The movie gets more interesting as it moves toward the ending credits, and its entertaining enough to watch.",1525564800,,1023,4.470588235294118

8424323,5,B004CZZZDQ,"Coleen Gray is gorgeous in this excellent movie.  If you want to see more of her try the movie ""Kansas City Confidential"" on Blu-ray.

Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  (You can burn an M-Disc at home too.)

Excellence entertainment for the entire family. Highly recommended.",1521763200,,620,4.738317757009346
