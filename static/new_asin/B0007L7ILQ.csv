8047984,5,B0007L7ILQ,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the detective is a lawyer and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life court trial is not as dramatic. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and often warned of swindles. The TV stories are simplified and changed versions from the original novel; many were created for TV. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s (""habeas corpus""). The prices and automobiles date these stories, so too the monetary figures. They record the styles and culture of the 1950s. The wealth of character actors enriches these stories; their emotions are portrayed by their facial expressions. [Does anyone recognize the view from Perry Mason's office window?]
