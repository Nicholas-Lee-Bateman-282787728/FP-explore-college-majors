1669339,4,B00005V15Q,"I disagree with the reviewer who praised the lavish sets, they were nothing of the kind, they were sparse and perfunctory and at best functional.  I agree with the reviewer who said they cramped the space.  I was disappointed in Gheorghiu during the first act, I was afraid this was going to be a Donizetti opera without a coloratura soprano in it, but in the second act she in places shone.  Unfortunately for me, she did not end her arias on high notes as Sutherland would have done, but rather went up (splendidly and solidly) and then alas dropped, as Caballe would have done.  Finally, in her long exchange with Alaimo near the end, she warbled which made me moan and think of a dying moose, but that was brief.  I love her overbite.  At the end of the show when she and her husband held a kiss while the lights faded out, I could see them giggling.  It was adorable.  The whole show was fun and (an opera?) actually funny (though the audience, which was legion, did not laugh), the many directorial touches were perfect.  As yet another reviewer mentioned, everyone one in it put his heart into it, and they all seemed to be having a ball, which was infectious.  Alagna sang like a dream, and Alaimo handled the patters with impossible perfection.  Incidentally, I love Verdi's Attila (commercial copies out of print everywhere), and have ordered a cheap copy (possibly filmed with a camera held in the audience by the uncle of one of the cast members!), and Alaimo is in it which gives me a little hope anyway.  I thought this show (Elisir) was a charming, well-sung riot.  I left a star off because of Gheorghiu's lack of facility in the 1st act.  Incidentally, I wouldn't have known it was set in the 1920s if I hadn't read it, but it obviously wasn't set in the 19th Century.  A wonderful show",1094860800,4,1803,4.504615384615384
1669340,5,B00005V15Q,"I'm a believer of live performances (local live performance is typically more enjoyable than Pavarotti/Levine/MET on plastic, so to speak) but enjoyed watching this as much as I would at the theater. Particularly overall acting to the last chorus girl is very engaging. I sometimes watch operas at home one act or scene at a time, but not this. I couldn't turn it off until the end. Beside the story itself and real-life newlyweds, that filming was an integral part of this production must be a factor as well to create such a compelling recording.
My favorite is Alagna. I know little about his other roles, but he is Nemorino incarnated in his singing and acting here. If you felt puzzled, like I did, by his ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" watch the extra ""Making of"" (""Love Potion"" from the menu) then watch/listen to the aria again (Act 2, track 22). Doesn't it sound and look whole a lot different? The CD (non-live) by the same cast contains two versions of the aria. Gheorghiu is lovely as ever. If I had to criticize, she could have worked on her facial expressions a wee bit here and there. As she comments herself, she is not a tragic heroine fated to die in the end this time. Alaimo (Dulcamara) is another critical element in this performance, commanding such a presence despite sweaty face. Scaltriti's caricatured army officer (Belcore) is not too silly nor wet and, I think, nicely complements the light-hearted atmosphere which is consistently palpable throughout the performance. I just wondered why his face was pulled to one side when singing...
Picture is very clear throughout, and the sound is good at least with my humble stereo system. There are technical issues (subtitles, unfriendly menu, etc.) and perhaps some other gripes, but, hey, do you want to simply enjoy a well-done opera at home? This is it.",1083110400,7,1821,4.802547770700637
1669341,5,B00005V15Q,"Esta es una muy interesante version de ""L' elissir d' amore"" desde todos los puntos de vista. La actualizacion escenica es acertada (traspaso de la accin a la actualidad), y tiene realmente bastantes gags muy conseguidos.
En lo vocal, ANGELA GHEORGHIU descolla con una Adina esplendida en lo vocal y desenvuelta en lo escenico, como tambien ROBERTO ALAGNA construye un Nemorino de alto nivel vocal y escenicamente. Muy divertido y bien cantado el Dulcamara de SIMONE ALAIMO, aqui casado con una vieja 'Madame Dulcamara'. Como Belcore, ROBERTO SCALTRITTI ofrece una caracterizacion muy conseguida del rol, y vocalmente esta mas que correcto.
EVELINO PIDO dirige con soltura a una orquesta y coro que rinden a gran nivel.
La toma de video es muy buena, la de sonido suficiente, y el dvd se complementa con un interesante documental sobre el making-off de la pera, que incluye ademas una version alternativa de la 'Furtiva lacrima', a cargo de Roberto Alagna.",1075075200,4,956,5.095541401273885
1669342,5,B00005V15Q,"This is by all means a very good production of a simple but very enjoyable opera. The cast is great. The singing is very good, but what makes this production special is that all the singers act very well and they also look their part. They look like they enjoyed themselves on stage and so does one watching them.
Please don't listen to the idiot who sais this is a poor production. You can see clearly that he has no idea of what he is saying when he sais it can't be good just because it is filmed in Lyon! He clearly has no idea of the great productions one can see nowadays all throughout Europe.
L'Elisir is a funny opera with lovable tunes and this production really achieves that. The sound quality is very good, even though it's true that the sound is a little narrow, with too much coming from the middle, specially in 5.1.
I sincerely recommend it! Great buy!",1073865600,8,869,4.337423312883436
1669343,5,B00005V15Q,"Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu are very well cast in this lighthearted production. Both are excellent actors, an important detail, and have wonderful voices. The sets, the rest of the cast and the orchestra all do a commendable job.  You will be humming some of the arias long after the DVD has finished playing.",1032566400,4,317,4.87037037037037
1669344,4,B00005V15Q,"This DVD is a gem!
 GREAT music by Donizetti; tunes that I'm continually humming to myself (because I can't sing) throughout the day. Wonderful singers: Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu in the starring roles, however the show is stolen by the performance of  Simone Alaimo who does a superlative job as Doctorre Dulcamara. Talk about getting into a role: he holds absolutely nothing back....magnificent! Just see him in the duet ""Quanto amore"" with Angela Gheorghiu and you'll see what I mean. It'll leave you breathless.

As far as the overall production, I have seen a couple operas staged (on DVD) from the Opera National de Lyon and  have not been disappointed in the results. They seem to have the knack of producing good audio and pleasing  sets that are easy to look at and  complement the people on stage.
Brian Large handles the video and editing so you know you're going to get  great camera angles.
My only negative comments(and thus the loss of one star) about this otherwise wonderful production is that  first,  Roberto Alagna's  voice came through my stereo system slightly tinny at times(maybe my system and/or the fact that I like my opera fairly loud) and second,  that I could swear someone hits the wrong note at the very end of the opera.
All in all an enjoyable show that I've listened to many times and just never get tired of. Absolutely worth getting.",1023580800,13,1379,4.776371308016878
1669345,4,B00005V15Q,"Excellent performances by Dulcamara and Belcore.  Nemorino just wasn't melodious enough for me.  This production was in 1996 and Roberto has certainly improved since.  As for Adina I do not think she was coquettish enough.  For some strange reason the scene was updated to the 1920s; why this when the original was quite ok?
I have the Pavarotti version on VHS, which is now coming out on DVD.  I much more prefer his Una Furtiva Lagrima than Roberto's.  Likewise I think Judith Blegen provides a better performance than Angela.  But Dulcamara and Belocre are much better in this version.  In my opinion both version are worth buying.",1023062400,4,634,4.859813084112149
1669346,5,B00005V15Q,"When I saw that this performance had been set in the 1920's, I nearly passed on it, because I have found that ""re-setting"" a work like Elisir rarely works. However, in this case, it ""works"" very well indeed. Elisir is a comic opera, so the stage action means more than in a serious opera (although good acting in all forms of opera obviously enhances the performance). Donizetti's score is full of memorable tunes, and there is not a dull moment in it. In this DVD, all of the principles have good stage presence, and, with one minor reservation on my part, all are first rate singers. This performance was recorded when Alagna and Gheorghiu were newlyweds, and there is certainly chemistry between them which intensifies the stage relationship between Nemorino and Adina. Both are in top vocal form here, as well. Bass, Simone Alaimo is tremendous as Dr. Dulcamara, with wonderful buffa stage presence. The staging of his ""snake oil sales"" technique is hilarious. Somewhat less than ideal is Roberto Scaltriti as Sgt. Belcore: his voice sounds dry and one dimensional. Maestro Pido conducts with obvious affection for the score and with sensitivity to what the singers are doing, as well. The video is excellent, and the sound is Dolby 5.1. One reviewer found that the audio soundstage was narrow, but I did not experience this in a large viewing room. I have noted in other operatic reviews that the DVD medium works superbly in bringing opera into the home, and this disc is further evidence in support of my belief. If you are an operaphile, this performance of Elisir is a ""must-have"". If you are curious as to whether or not opera is for you, then this would be an ideal way to find out.",1021507200,18,1693,4.722972972972973
1669347,4,B00005V15Q,"This is an exuberant production with a marvelous cast and sensitive musical direction. Filmed in a 16x9 format before a live audience, the opera is indeed a joy to behold. The pairing of the husband-and-wife team of Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu works beautifully throughout and the contributions of the other principals leaves nothing to be desired. The work has been updated into the 1920s and the results are  satisfying although not quite so colourful as traditional presentations. The stage appears a little cramped and I would have liked to see more space for everyone to move around. Video direction by Brian Large is exemplary as usual. Picture quality throughout is excellent.
My one criticism concerns the audio tracks available on the DVD. Neither the Dolby Digital 5.1 nor the Dolby Stereo is entirely satisfactory because both produce a fairly narrow left-to-right soundstage with too much of the sound emanating from the middle. The absence of a good 2-channel PCM audio track is regrettable. The balance between voice and orchestra is fine however as is the overall quality of all the singers. For years Decca had a top-notch reputation for first-class sound in its recordings. On this occasion however, they fell somewhat short of the mark.
The inclusion of an excellent 52-minute documentary of the making of the video and CD is to be commended as is the comprehensive booklet.",1019606400,8,1400,5.086956521739131
7955759,5,B00005V15Q,"So Dulcamara has a van instead of a wagon, the mild updating doesn't grate. Alagna's small, beautiful voice suits perfectly.",1374278400,2,124,5.25
7955760,4,B00005V15Q,very enjoyable.  There is a lot of energy on stage and it makes a very lively performance. Fun light opera,1360713600,,106,4.3
7955761,5,B00005V15Q,"This is a well-known, even famous, performance of Donizetti's very popular opera. Part of its fame resides in the fact that it was made shortly after Alagna's and Gheorghui's marriage and who were subsequently billed as a dream couple casting. In fact the whole cast could be described as a dream team specially assembled for the intended Decca double recording - a recording of the 'live' opera performance for DVD followed by a separate recording for CD audio release only. These were two separate events and approached differently as the documentary makes clear.

The `live' performance fully lives up to all expectations. The relationship between Alagna and Gheorgui sparkles with the freshness you might expect from a newly married couple and both are on top form vocally. To this Alagna adds plenty of extra energy into his acting of a young, inexperienced Nemorino rather than just a simpleton. Simone Alaimo manages the rapidity and energetic humour of his role as Dulcamara but still manages to sing all the notes. This is a very important consideration as he explains in the documentary. Similarly, Roberto Scaltriti as Belcore is able to put over the caricature nature of his part musically with a fine sense of comedic timing and presence. The chorus respond fully and enthusiastically to the demands made upon them and add considerably to the sense of fun.

The documentary, `Love Potion' is an extensive and detailed film that describes the nature of each main part, the special demands upon the voices and the acting, and the research into producing what Donizetti intended by referring back to his original manuscript. The first part of this film relates to the DVD recording of the 'live' performance and contains interesting supplementary information in the form of brief interviews and rehearsal extracts. The film then goes on to show how the following separate recording for CD sound only had completely different demands and also how the music was recorded for that in its uncut version, unlike most `live' performances including this one.

The recording from 1996 was made using 6 HD cameras and the result is crisp imaging coupled with all the usual expertise that one would expect from the experienced Brian Large team. The excellent sound is presented in DD 5.1 and stereo. There is a complementary CD included with highlights from the audio recording.

This is a fine production and performance which has been very well recorded. It has now achieved something of a benchmark status which is fully deserved and thus 5 stars would seem to be the correct level of assessment. It is likely to continue to give considerable pleasure to purchasers for many years yet to come.",1343520000,2,2696,5.011160714285714
7955762,5,B00005V15Q,"Gaetano Donizetti: L'Elisir d'Amore - Opera National de Lyon is a 1997 Decca Record Company under the direction of Evelino Pido who leads the National Opera Orchestra and Choir of Lyon. The booklet contains well-written music notes, all the lyrics and photographs of the performers from the time of the recording. The performance by Angela Gheorghiu is splendid and hearing her sing with her husband Roberto Alagna is truly magical. Truly a delightful recording that I very much enjoyed listening to. Highly recommended. 5/5.",1341964800,,525,5.261904761904762

7955764,4,B00005V15Q,"I was a bit reluctant to buy this DVD mostly because I do not see the pair Alagna Gheorghiu as belcanto singers.  However I was pleased of proving myself wrong.  They both are superb in their roles.  I do not know if this is my personal impression or what, but Gheorghiu's voice has some of Maria Callas' texture.  On the other hand I have never been a big fan of Algna but I have to admit that he is great in the role of Nemorino, both acting and singing.  His version of  ""Una furtiva lacrima"" is not quite ortodox though but it is OK anyway.",1201651200,4,544,4.133333333333334
7955765,5,B00005V15Q,"This is an excellent performance of Donizetti's L'elisir d'Amore. Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna perform very well as the intended couple in the opera (at a time of their wedding as a couple in real life). Their musical performance is truly beautiful as well as their acting. I disagree with one of the previous reviews that stated that Gheorghiu does not have a feel for comedy. Actually, her performance in the ""rejection"" scences is outstanding and funny. Yes, I agree that she stands out better in La Traviatta, but the comparison is out of scope. One can not compare the Traviatta, which is full of stress and strong emotional expression with a light and funny comedy as L'elisir d'Amore. The same applies to the comparison between L'elisir d'Amore and Lucia de Lammermoore.",1193788800,7,784,4.946969696969697
7955766,3,B00005V15Q,"I was so looking forward to this production of L'Elisir d'Amore, partly because Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna are superb in La Traviata (she) and Lucie de Lammermoor (he). In addition, I thought it would be fun to see the real-life newlyweds onstage together. The sets and costumes look good, the orchestra and supporting cast sound good, but the leads are a disappointment. Gheorghiu's singing is, as usual, steely and pure, but she just doesn't seem to have a feel for comedy. By contrast, Alagna is having a lot of fun onstage, but his voice is grating much of the time. Both of their performances feel forced. Donizetti's sparkling melodious score is not well-served. Compare this to the delightful Met production of 1991 starring Luciano Pavarotti and Kathleen Battle (also on DVD). Pavarotti and Battle are so at ease on stage and their singing is spectacular. I also recommend the DVD of the Macerata Opera production from 2002; it features less well-known performers but is a joyful experience from beginning to end.

I've read that Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna aren't onstage together as often because he's more comfortable performing in French. That sounds like a good choice to me because he's outstanding in the French versions of Donizetti's Lucie de Lammermoor and Verdi's Don Carlos. By contrast, here and in Il Trovatore, his voice often sounds forced and sometimes even shrill.",1161561600,8,1407,5.064655172413793
7955767,4,B00005V15Q,"Roberto Alagna's acting in this l'elisir is just wonderful. You can very easily see that he's heartbroken because his love for the rich girl Adina isn't reciprocated and you really feel sorry for him. He's also funny in the scene where he buys the magic liquor from Dulcamara and gets drunk on it. I just wish that his singing skills matched his acting skills. I'm not saying that his singing is awful; it's just that he doesn't move me with his singing. And I'm not too keen on his vibrato. But still, you just have to love his version of Nemorino.

Anghela Gheorghiu plays the rich girl Adina and is doing an adequate job. I was expecting her to sail through this opera with flying colours, but I felt there was something lacking in her performance. Or perhaps I was expecting too much, having recently watched her performance in Tosca which was absolutely brilliant. Maybe she's just more dramatic than funny? Even though her voice is beautiful she doesn't impress me as much here as she did in the aforementioned Tosca.

Belcore is played by Roberto Scaltriti and the only one I truly didn't enjoy. I can't explain why, but it really disturbed me that when singing, his mouth was constantly drawn to the left side of his face. (After writing this review I discovered that other Amazon reviewers also have commented on this. So obviously this was disturbing for more people than just me....) His voice also has a slightly nasal tone that I don't like too much.

Simone Alaimo is playing Dulcamare and he looks as if he's enjoying himself in the role. His singing is good and there are some really funny moments when he's approached by Nemorino who wants to buy the magic liquor.

I have to say I didn't pay too much attention on the supporting cast, but at least there's no one I remember for doing an awful job.

Even though this performance has some flaws I still think it's worth 4 stars and well worth having in an opera collection. If you think of it as an ordinary movie and not an opera, it's even worth 5 stars.",1126915200,5,2022,4.528767123287671
7955768,1,B00005V15Q,"I was looking forward to watching this DVD, but thanks to incomptent authoring by Miles Tudor and Philip Rowlands, who botched the 16x9 enhancement so that it doesn't work on all players, including mine, producing a painful image that ought to require these men be subjected to Argento Opera meets Space Warriors 2000, for all two of you who get my joke, as the two similarly screwed up The Death of Klinghoffer.
