8307071,5,B001GTFP2W,"""one day i was scrolling the somewhat infinite pages of Netflix. i came across the anime section and found this cause i was bored out of my mind at the time, so i watched the first episode and then the second, and then the entire season. School Rumble is a hilarious show i was laughing so much i could not contain myself, the show is perfect voice acting, artwork everything if you like anime buy this show or you will be missing out on so much- i bought the entire first season and now I'm buying part 2 of the second season only because part 1 is quite expensive

two words- KENJI HARIMA

8307072,5,B001GTFP2W,"As the viewer before me mentioned this will probably be the last of this fantastic and highly underrated high school based comedy anime. Season two pulls a little further away from as romance intensive as the first season and focuses more on the comedic aspect of the series; which may or may not be a good thing depending on why you continue to watch.

 Regardless it still manages to retain it's signature charm and brilliant narrative pacing. Character development seems to also take a bit more of a backseat but is not completely absent. Many of the main characters enjoy more of a spotlight and keep the personality traits that make them so endearing; Tenma being as frustrating and adorable as always and Harima oblivious and determined to win her affections.

If you enjoyed the previous episodes of this wonderful series you will continue to be a fan. If you're a fan of anime that boasts big eccentric casts that are constantly the victims of misunderstandings and have never watched School Rumble before you're going to love it. Those who have not viewed it before I strongly recommend you go back to the beginning, though not necessary as you can jump in at any time, you will be doing yourself a huge disservice missing out on this hilarious and engaging series.",1243641600,5,1274,4.755656108597285
8307073,5,B001GTFP2W,"School Rumble Season 2 Part 2 is, in my opinion, much more entertaining than the previous half of the season.  Sadly, this will probably be the last collection of episodes for the series, as after this there is only a two episode OVA that quickly ends the series.  But until then, we have this great set to watch!

Now the cast of characters continues to grow and you may be a little lost if this is your first School Rumble purchase (I would recommend watching the first season first), but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you haven't.  There are a LOT of random anime and manga style references (Episode 21 is a good example of this, spoofing ""magical girl"" anime) in this set.  The series does touch on the original ""love triangle"" story somewhat, but that has been downplayed quite a bit as the series goes on.

This set is one of the best anime releases to date, and continues the School Rumble series very well.",1234742400,4,924,4.437869822485207
