2886018,3,B000SK5ZDY,"I kind of like David Carradine's roles, but this movie just didn't have anything of a Christmas feel to it. Likewise, it was a little on the hokey side. Christmas Miracle at Sage Creek did provide plenty of atmosphere for the flow and nature of the movie. It carried a feel of the cattleman day's northwest to it. Just don't buy it for a real good Christmas movie.",1357516800,,364,4.367647058823529
2886019,4,B000SK5ZDY,"This one is a great movie, kind of predictable. Enjoyed one of the last performaces by Carradine. Still would recommend for enjoyment.",1324425600,,134,5.136363636363637

2886023,5,B000SK5ZDY,"I like the movie, it was good movie starring David Carradine, Wes Stiudi, Irene Beddard. It let you what can happens when people get together and changes one who thought all people are bad.",1196553600,6,189,4.588235294117647

8205507,1,B000SK5ZDY,"The DVD  is the same movie as the Miracle at Sage Creek. Just a different title and cover, no difference. Big disappointment.",1523232000,,125,4.681818181818182

8205509,3,B000SK5ZDY,"Somewhat slow, but pretty well done as far as acting goes. Basically a variation of Christmas Carol/Scrooge.  I expected more action. David Carradine is a long way from Grasshopper.",1514246400,,181,5.241379310344827

8205512,5,B000SK5ZDY,A family-oriented western that will be enjoyed by everyone in the family!  The actors bring each scene to life.  The outdoor scenery and indoor settings are a joy to behold and study.  I highly recommend this DVD!,1475280000,,213,4.702702702702703

8205516,1,B000SK5ZDY,"Typical cheesy story line of grinch-like person becoming nice, but from a truly Christmas perspective it was offensive to any Christian believing the meaning of Christmas as related to birth of Christ.  God couldn't save a dying boy but an indian witch doctor type could wave a feather and say a 'magic' prayer and heal him?  And they left a dying gunshot man out in the wilderness to die while eating a Christmas meal at home?  For non-Christians a feel good cheesy movie at best, but for Christians it was offensive making the pastor a weak and unlikable man/father/husband...",1387756800,,578,4.818181818181818
