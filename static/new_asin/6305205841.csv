7884888,4,6305205841,Early-to-mid 50's adventure film.  Stars John Agar before he started acting in sci-fi films.  Apparently filmed in Haiti and surrounding islands.  A young woman hires a charter boat captain to help find some treasure that is located underwater at a legendary island.  The treasure is originally found by her father who ran afoul of a malevolent Voodoo priest when he steals a religious idol.  When he is killed off they go to find treasure and offend local practices.  Not bad time-passer and the photography and color is very nice.  I bought a DVD-R release (pictured below) and the quality is very good.  Recommended for adventure film fans.,1435017600,,643,4.94392523364486
7884889,5,6305205841,"I saw this movies in my home town in 1957 and loved it for the splendid color and the plot line and Rosemarie Bowe.....It now is right beside me as I type this and I read the notes on this VHS tape.  Why it was NOT released on Blue Ray DVD is beyond me as it is far more entertaining than some of the DVD Drivel available today.

I have looked for this for over ten years (on DVD) and tried the VHS and found it and lept at the opportunity.  Greatr find and Great buy.",1420070400,,468,3.8541666666666665

Finally, someone returned a favor I did and found it for me at Turner Classic hard to find movies.  I was able to locate it on Amazon and purchase it.  Finally, after over 50 years, I was able to see it again.",1271894400,,377,3.986666666666667
