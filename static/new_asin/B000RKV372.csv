3447908,3,B000RKV372,Good war movie but doesn't stand up to most others. It gives you an idea of what was happening in Italy at end of war.,1409961600,,118,3.76

3447911,4,B000RKV372,"I am glad I persevered and watched this movie.  It was strange because there was so much dialogue in various languages--at times I thought I was watching an Italian or French movie with subtitles.  The English spoken was difficult to follow sometimes because the actors were British mostly.  But the story was moving and I thought it was carefully and intelligently done.  I am sure those who are critical of film quality would say the print is not good, but I just chalked it up to an old black and white film.  I felt after having seen it that I had learned something and had been entertained or, more correctly, touched by the story of the refugees.  If you like movies about wartime Europe this is a good movie for you.",1404000000,2,723,4.480916030534351
3447912,5,B000RKV372,"There's a DVD. Don't know if it is any better.  Despite the poor video transfer and poor sound, this Swiss film is still well worth the time to watch. The actors speak the languages of their characters, so there's very little English and most of the film is English sub-titles of French, German, Italian, etc., which does make it easier to watch. Even with my poor hearing, I was still able to understand the English dialog. Visually, its not in great condition, but you will find that after the first 10 minutes, you won't notice because the film is so compelling. The Last Chance is a dialog-driven WWII thriller about escaping Italy into Switzerland. It's actually a Swiss film that won a number of awards at the time of it's release, including the USA's National Board of Review Ten Best Films of the Year, and awards for promoting international understanding and peace. It depicts the sacrifice of others to help those in need in the face of the horror of Nazi mass-murders and sending boxcars of people off to their deaths in concentration camps. If it were less well written and directed, it would still be a powerful anti-fascist propaganda film. It's disappointing that this great film isn't better known. If I haven't convinced you, take the time to look at the films The Last Chance competed against in The Golden Globes, Cannes, and NBR. That alone should convince you to watch this gem.",1394409600,9,1399,4.733606557377049
3447913,1,B000RKV372,"This is a very worthwhile movie from film director Leopold Lindtberg that some outfit like Criterion Collection ought to restore and release. The story of two POWs escaping Italy to Switzerland during WWII and having to lead (at first unwillingly) a small group of refugees across the border was very compelling and well told.

But Reel Classic Films unfortunately made an awful transfer to DVD of this film and at the price they're charging for their shoddy work, it's a rip off.  I can be pretty tolerant of the fuzziness and the Kodalith-like contrast of unrestored old films just to have a forgotten little film gem in my collection while I await a decent restoration.  But what's INEXCUSABLE is that the maker of this DVD didn't even maintain the original film format during the transfer.  This film was from 1945--THERE WAS NO WIDE-SCREEN FORMAT THEN. So why did Reel Classic Films make it wide-screen format, except their DVD transfer work is either ignorant of film formats or careless (probably both). What you get is an irritating physical distortion of the actors that can't be adjusted on your DVD player.

Do not buy this DVD.  Wait for a properly done DVD transfer from someone else and restoration or see this film at a Leopold Lindtberg festival.",1249344000,12,1262,4.846511627906977
3447914,5,B000RKV372,"This movie is moving. It is about a pair of escape POW that end up in the middle of Italy, and their only hope is to escape to Switzerland. Along the way they meet up with other refugees trying to escape fascism. I highly recommend this tale of sacrifice for the good of humanity.",1205193600,2,280,4.203703703703703

8277357,5,B000RKV372,"In WWII, two allied airmen end up as POWs in Italy. They escape from a train, fraternize with the local girls, but end up trying to lead a group of endangered civilians from their hilltop village over the mountains to safety in Switzerland, while pursued by an enemy ski corps. A haunting, touching, beautiful film. I saw it when it was shown at Radio City Music Hall in 1945, and was overjoyed when it came out first on tape and then on DVD. Directed by the brilliant Austrian/Jewish Leopold Lindtberg who fled from Germany to Switzerland where he made this film. ""Die Letzte Chance"" won a special Peace Prize at Cannes. Yes, the film does not look new. Nor does the Mona Lisa.

Warning: the film starts slowly, at least to viewers accustomed to the slam-bam beginnings of most contemporary movies.",1451520000,,799,4.666666666666667
