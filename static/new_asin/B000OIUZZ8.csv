8185310,4,B000OIUZZ8,"These older episodes of PBS's Nature series were great wildlife documentaries.  This one is the first episode of the miniseries ""The Nature of Australia"", which was shown on PBS in six parts back in 1988.  There is much compelling footage of Australian wildlife, including kangaroos and other marsupials.  We are also shown how Australia became a separate continent with its unique wildlife.  The photography is amazing and Time-Life Video gave the viewers decent quality in the 1980's when the series was offered on VHS.  I only wish that now the episodes would be made available on DVD, the preferred format of today's technology. However, you will find these videos very enjoyable if you love nature/wildlife films.",1209686400,,718,5.155172413793103
