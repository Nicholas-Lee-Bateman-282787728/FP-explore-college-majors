8475737,5,B005JJ4HK6,"Thanksgiving is one of my favorite times of year, coming as it does between Halloween and Christmas. I realized long ago that the true story of Thanksgiving is somewhat different from the one I learned growing up in a small Midwestern farming community in the 50's and 60's. This TV show may have clarified some of those misconceptions, but it certainly did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the holiday. In the end, does it really matter if venison and lobster were served instead of pumpkin pie and turkey or if the Native Americans weren't invited so much as just showed up to see what all the noise was about? Getting together with family and friends on a special day to give thanks and have fun is the important thing. I very much enjoyed this show, and I'm glad I can now watch it anytime I want to experience the holiday again.",1481328000,2,836,4.506578947368421

8475739,4,B005JJ4HK6,"I make a point to record this every year because it's fascinating history and puts me in the mood for Halloween.  The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the quality isn't that good.  In it's defense, the quality on tv isn't that great either.  I really do love the information in though. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in Halloween.",1438646400,3,358,4.5625
