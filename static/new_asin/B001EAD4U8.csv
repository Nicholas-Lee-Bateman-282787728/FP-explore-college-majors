8297232,1,B001EAD4U8,"dude stop trying to rip people off. You can buy the entire 1-7 seasons individually for a 10th of the price. Personally, if you are going to over price things you sell as much as you are I'll be writing to Amazon to have your vendor privileges removed as you are just a thieving scam artist. Have a nice one.",1397779200,2,308,4.15
8297233,5,B001EAD4U8,"This is the best kids show ever. If you guys buy the seasons separately, it's cheaper. The cost is only so high bc the seller set it that way, not amazon. You can also get the whole season burned for you for about $23 and quality is great.",1395100800,,239,4.0
8297234,5,B001EAD4U8,If you loved these books as a child or if you have a pre teen at home who loves to read this is a great collection.,1387324800,,115,3.4615384615384617
8297235,1,B001EAD4U8,"You don't have to pay $1000 to see this show! You can watch all of the episodes online for free! That is bogus!!!! $99.99, maybe, if you want to keep it forever and have it in a box set, but to pay more than that is shameful. Perhaps he wrote the price in wrong? Good luck selling it for that much, buddy.",1387324800,2,305,3.935483870967742
8297236,5,B001EAD4U8,"(11/23/2013) I loved the show as a young kid / early teenager, but don't B.S. me with the price! I saw that the price was $1,000 (give or take a bit).  Either the price is real, which it could theoretically be; or Amazon has one SERIOUS price hacking problem.  I don't know what it is, but somehow I think it is the latter...%$#holes.  God help everyone if the majority of retailers accept ""Bitcoin"" or whatever the hell this hacker currency is.",1385164800,2,445,4.469135802469136
8297237,4,B001EAD4U8,"""Are You Afraid of The Dark?"" is hands down my favorite show from my childhood & still to this day I enjoy it. The premise of this show is simple, a group of teens sit around a campfire & tell scary stories. However, the stories are shown as actual characters acting out the stories in a smiler style as episodes from ""The Twilight Zone"". While the stories are scary, they never are over the top & never go beyond PG-13 (but some get pretty close). I'd recommend ages 8 & up but truthfully, I was watching this show at 6 or maybe even younger. Now hear's the bad news, to get this show you need to pay close to $1,000.00 in American money (this show was broadcast in Canada at the same time as America so the Canadian price could be higher). I think that this price is completely ridiculous. Because of this high price I feel that most people will decide to not buy it, both the original fans & the new ones. Because of this people will most likely just get it from a torrent & that's just sad. Because this is so expensive the studio will end up losing money from the high price rather make a ton of money from the high price. I'd give this 5 stars for the show but it gets 4 stars because of being ridiculously expensive.",1383177600,,1223,4.208510638297873
8297238,1,B001EAD4U8,"This whole series is way too expensive. It is a good show but it isn't worth a thousand bucks. It's barley worth over $150 but unless you set the price lower, I won't buy this series pack. And my opinion, I doubt anyone will.",1366070400,,225,4.136363636363637
8297239,5,B001EAD4U8,I am dying for the day these dvds are reprinted......watching them online isn't the same....I must own physical copy to obsess over and love forever......please!,1332115200,2,161,5.48
8297240,5,B001EAD4U8,"I have loved this show ever since I was a little kid.  I watch them on Youtube, but it's just not the same.  It would be awesome to have a reunion of the Midnight Society party at my house and watch a different season with my buddies each weekend for a couple months.  So Please reprint this dvd set.  I personally guarantee you I will purchase it for myself ans several for my friends too!",1321315200,,390,4.16
