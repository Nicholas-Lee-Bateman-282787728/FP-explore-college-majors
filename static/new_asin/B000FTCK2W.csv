There isn't a whole lot of instruction on each lick, but they are played fast and slow enough times to catch what's going on with them, and you can go back and pick out what you missed.  The great thing about this dvd is it gave me a foundation that I would use to build my own licks.  Its definitely worth getting.",1370995200,,390,4.105263157894737
8126472,4,B000FTCK2W,"I'm an intermediate guitar player with interests in the Rock and Metal sound, and brand new to country music. Recently a friend gave me Paisley's Play CD (amazing CD I might add) which gave me a new found respect and interest for country music. Anyway, I went in search of some instruction material and stumbled accross this. There were no reviews, but it was 2 hours long and priced really good so I went ahead and bought it, and was not disappointed.

The DVD like I mentioned is two hours long and there is absolutely no fill, it's all instruction. It's done by Steve Trovato and he takes and completely breaks down three Albert Lee solo's, General Lee, Sweet Little Lisa and Country Banjo Rolls. At first I was really put out because there was no tab included. I was pleasantly suprised when I started watching. He broke down the solos into such small, bite size sections that I could learn and comprehend without tab. He plays the complete solo first and then goes back and tears it down into those small parts playing it at normal speed and then slow several times, explaining exactly what he's doing, before moving on. The camera angles and sound quality is top notch, and it aslo includes the jam tracks for the three songs. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of the 5 because no tab was included, it's still a great work and I've learned some great licks and runs that I never thought possible for me, but this DVD would have been made perfect with the tab to practice with and review.",1238803200,18,1489,4.4944649446494465
