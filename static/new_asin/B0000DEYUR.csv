8000807,5,B0000DEYUR,"I have used this DVD to develop a skills progression for my U10 team. For the first 10 minutes of practice, the players are in pairs doing the passing and receiving touches demonstrated here, before we move on to small sided games. Many coaching DVDs and books do not present skills in a sensible order. This DVD does a great job. Passing and receiving touches of many different kinds are properly developed before trying fancy dribbling moves, which are covered in their proper sequence. Passing, receiving, trapping, dribbling, moves, shooting, long passing, gathering long passes, heading, and juggling are all covered in the many chapters. A U8/U10/U12 soccer coach can run his team through these sequences at their own pace. Then, they can move on to the sequel, ""One on One Coaching: The Advanced Player,"" available from Reedswain.com, for an even higher skill level.

Or, you can use this DVD with your child in the back yard to accelerate your child's skill development beyond his peer level.

That is how the DVD was actually designed.",1142640000,3,1044,4.96
8000808,5,B0000DEYUR,"This is by far the best dvd for teaching your child soccer you can buy.  Wilkenson is extremely clear, thoughtful,and organizes a progression of skills. For example, teaching the child to receive the ball on the ground - the child in the dvd shows how to use inside and outside of foot,move it to the right or left, then incorporates a fake, and has the parent raise their hand to get the child to look up after receiving the ball. Each element is to be added as the child becomes more competent.  My child(U10),who takes lessons and is a travel team player, learned a tremendous amount from the DVD with Mom and Dad helping.",1096588800,10,625,4.473684210526316
