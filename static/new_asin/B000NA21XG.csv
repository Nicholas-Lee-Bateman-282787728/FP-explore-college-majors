2763862,4,B000NA21XG,"This Diego video gets 4 stars from me because of 2 reasons. The first reason being it does not play in all dvd capable players. I had trouble playing it in the ps2 but it worked fine in the dvd player and the mini dvd player. The second reason I gave the video only 4 stars was because the title was a little bit misleading. I thought that Diego had an actual ""Sing Along"" video but it was like the regular Diego shows.

The sing along part of the title comes from the iguanas that are preparing to do a song, which is about 8 lines long but they have to find Iggy first before their official ""sing along"" can commence.",1328400000,4,619,4.115702479338843
2763863,5,B000NA21XG,"One of the best products for preschoolers. The Iguana Sing Along is another great collection, my son loves it, he can play Diego the whole day long. When I opened the Amazon's package and my son saw Diego he screamed - DIEEEGO, that one, that one! Great messages in all episodes, Diego teaches not only Spanish, but music rhythm, sing-along, courtesy, humbleness, and to care about animals and nature. 5 stars to this little Animal Rescuer.",1288396800,4,440,4.802631578947368

Although his speech is limited, he makes it pretty clear what DVD he wants when it comes to occasions in which he can receive a gift. Diego is not my cup of tea - but my special needs boy loves him, jaguar and Alicia (spelling?). Amazon always offers great deals and I do my best to take advantage of them.
