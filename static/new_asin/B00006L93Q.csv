1784152,5,B00006L93Q,"An incredible documentary that takes a hard look at the gay circuit party scene.  Funny and sobering, witty and truthful, edgy and insightful.  Simply fantsastic.",1035072000,2,162,5.44
1784193,3,B00006L93Q,"I was not remotely interested in seeing a documentary about pretty party boys, but as a result of circumstances beyond my control see it I did.  I was quite surprised to find a rather watchable film which provided a skimming-the-surface view into a world that I am quite unfamiliar with.

The not very deep nature of the investigation is entirely appropriate given the topic and the utterly vague and vacuuos nature of the people that the filmmaker chose to focus on.  You can't help but watch this sometimes bizarre, always self-absorbed and yet compellingly vacant group of people talking earnestly to the camera as though they are providing important anthropological insights - and, ironically, perhaps they are.

It does not make the people or the parties look particularly appealing, and it generated a lot of laughs from the audience that I saw it with, but I do think that many young gay men will identify with the topics of the film.  Those topics may be a turn-off, but they are kind of interesting.",1154217600,6,1008,4.803468208092486
1784194,1,B00006L93Q,"I have viewed a lot of great gay films, when boys fly is not one of them i will not be passing on to friends",1123977600,,108,3.36
1784195,3,B00006L93Q,"It was easy to get through this entire movie, don't get me wrong. It is just definitely not worth a second viewing because you know you didn't miss anything. This is a documentary focusing on boys going to the be-all end-all circuit party, the White Party (or is it White Ball?). They got a group of three guys (Scott, Jason and Todd) who, while interesting, really don't add much to the overall point of the movie. The Jason has and Scott IS dating Todd when the movie is filmed. If anything they show us the most average experience one might have at a circuit party. Their personal drama is what makes their segments interesting but in the end does nothing more than prove something that could have happened at any club or watering hole anywhere.

  The next boy is Tone (prounounced Tony and hereafter spelled Tony cuz spelling Tony as Tone is just stupid). He is the junkie of the experimental grouping. We have all heard tales of how bad the drugs are at these parties and he is supposed to be the posterboy for that addiction. If he is the worst of it, I am not nearly as worried as I was. He was, at best, a part-time junkie. Don't get me wrong, Tony does have a drug problem, but did not seem nearly as profound as we are led to believe.

  The last boy is Brandon, who is the one who has never been to one of these circuit parties before. Again, nothing profound. His segment does show how even a straight lace like Brandon can easily give into the ""atmosphere"" of those parties which was interesting.

  Overall, this movies does not offer anything about circuit parties that you do not already know. I am saying that as someone who has never even thought about going to one. But, as someone who has never gone it was interesting to see some of the inner-workings and what not. The non-stop scenes full of shirtless hotties does help this movie's case. All of the five main boys are pretty cute, too.

  One thing about this movie is the selection of those five main boys. It introduces more guys but does not go into their 'characters' too much, which is a shame. I wanted to know more about all the second class characters as the main boys I had figured out early on. The movie limited itself far too much, it should have been longer and more indulgent on the ugly side of circuit parties.

  If you have been to a circuit party (even a minor one, I am guessing) you don't need to see this movie. You already know. If not, it is worth a look but just don't go out of your way to see it.",1114387200,14,2498,4.319057815845825
1784196,5,B00006L93Q,"I really enjoyed this film.  Never having attended one of these parties, I enjoyed the look into this fast-paced lifestyle that this film provided.  I feel that this film was an honest and real depiction of what can and does occur at these parties. ""Boys"" depicted the hardcore drug/party life and those who attend these parties to just let loose and have fun.  It was a fair and honest depiction of the party scene.",1041638400,7,416,4.594594594594595
1784197,3,B00006L93Q,"WHEN BOYS FLY is an intriguing and entertaining look into the sub-culture of the Circuit Party scene. The film pulls no punches as it follows various young(and some not-so-young) men as they delve into the fun, the danger, and the debauchery that is all-too prevalent in the annual bacchanal held in Miami Beach. Like most parties, the merriment comes with a price, and in the case of the party-hearty revellers presented here, it is a price they are all-too willing to pay.",1038009600,10,474,4.7926829268292686
1784198,5,B00006L93Q,"I found the documentary ""When Boys Fly"" to be a surprisingly engaging and fascinating, candid, shocking and sometimes sad peek through the looking glass to see what really goes on at ""gay raves,"" aka circuit parties.  Filmmakers Rolov and Halpern did a great job in showing us the world in which this segment of so-called ""A-listers"" live and party, and how some newcomers and White party veterans are drawn into the circle of rave party life and its immediate results...good and bad.  The quick editing makes for a fast-paced viewing and humor is where you might not always expect to find it in this honest and non-judgemental portrayal of this subculture within a subculture that I believe can be enjoyed by gay and straight, young-to-middle-aged audiences alike.",1037318400,4,765,5.015748031496063
1784199,4,B00006L93Q,"This film pushes the envelope and gives viewers a full access pass to the circuit party scene. It is enlightening to hear and see and meet the people who are part of this world. The documentary unfolds in a way that does not judge or disparage the main characters; it's a very honest, tragic and sometimes hysterical portrayal of their lives and the thrill or high they aspire to achieve. I highly recommend this film for those who have gone to a circuit party, are curious, or just want to experience something unlike anything they have ever experienced before.",1037318400,4,562,4.686868686868687
1784200,4,B00006L93Q,"""When Boys Fly"" gives you the real, inside look at circuit parties through the eyes of several attendees.  It captures the joy and release many feel at the parties while not shying away from those who take things too far.  Perhaps too much emphasis was placed on the latter and it ends on a melancholy note but overall it was still excellent.  The best look at circuit culture I've seen on film.",1037232000,2,395,4.458333333333333
1784201,5,B00006L93Q,"Rolov and Halpern have made a beautiful and powerful film with ""When Boys Fly.""  I had never thought of the world of gay circuit parties as something I would find particularly intriguing, yet this film answered questions I didn't even know I had. A must see!",1036540800,7,258,4.608695652173913
1784202,5,B00006L93Q,I was fortunate enough to see this film at Outfest in Los Angeles and I loved it! It is a fascinating and riveting look inside the depths of the gay circuit party scene. A must see!,1036540800,,181,4.055555555555555

7971203,4,B00006L93Q,"This about the race parties the gay guys go to, and you can see how these men do drugs, drink, and three group of guys go on their experience",1460073600,,141,3.896551724137931
7971204,2,B00006L93Q,"The stories of three subjects introduce us to the world of circuit parties. At first, its all very exciting. Its a world where very little imports, but being young, having a great body, and being prepared to take drugs, lots of drugs, in a rave that will take a whole evening, if not a whole weekend. Were supposed to follow the trajectories of three men, all with different shapes and objectives, and see what happens. And what we see is not the best of the worlds. An evening of dancing that ruins a body for its extremes, leaving young and potentially good people to a rack. At the end we see people being taken to hospital, even getting premature strokes. Lives consumed by the illusion of great moments. Its a pretty disillusioned documentary, with obvious detrimental effects, taken at the most possible no judgmental view. You will certainly finish the film with a bitter felling in your mouth, thinking of which were the illusion prospects of the subjects and their final results. What won't make them disillusioned. So strong are the brief moments of happiness experimented during the circuit that many will return, until",1444867200,,1130,4.829896907216495

7971206,1,B00006L93Q,"I bought this on Amazon after having been misled again by bogus reviews. This DVD is a waste of time. It does not succeed on any level. It's a bunch of silly, shallow gay men acting like fools. I expected Club Kids with great costumes like Michael Alig popularized in NYC. The only message here is that drugs can be dangerous. Gee whiz, I didn't know that. The drug abuse is not scary enough to drive anyone to rehab. It is not ""fabulous, honest, engaging, or provocative."" It is boring and not erotic as suggested by the cover.",1377648000,,528,4.3979591836734695
7971207,4,B00006L93Q,"What a great look into the dark side of pleasureland for grown up boys who get caught up in the drama of the circuit world. Though not all agree that its always a true case with everyone that loves to go to the dance parties for the love of the music and the scenery. It can be said that for a few that get caught up of the mystery of addiction, drugs, and sex when all get mixed up in one setting, that it can take a toll of friendships, relationships and the human body. I loved the followup of the main characters and hope they can make a continuation of how they have changed since the making of the movie.",1182816000,2,610,4.049586776859504
7971208,5,B00006L93Q,"I was quite suprised with this documentary. For someone who has never been to a circuit party, I was quite impressed to see why different people choose to go, to see the different guys who attend and to show a glimpse into some of the things that happen at a circuit party. While there are some sexy parts, well-defined shirtless guys make up about half of the film. They also did a great job with the follow-up. Overall, if you're looking to find out a little more about the circuit life and find out what GHB is, then you'll most certainly like this documentary.",1179792000,,564,4.4326923076923075
7971209,3,B00006L93Q,"Some pretty blatant manipulation and staging of events (roommate Scott's kitchen confrontation with Tone) in the film lead me to be more than a bit cynical after viewing When Boys Fly last night. On one hand, it does a very good job in capturing the intense and sometimes overwhelming atmosphere of the circuit scene - pretty, buff, often very high boys everywhere you look. I know from experience just how seductive  that can be. I also applaud the fact that the film does not shy away from showing how the initial excitement almost always devolves into sad, desperate, strung-out souls searching for something more. It's definitely a cautionary tale BUT at the same time it blatantly fetishizes the scene and the men who attend the parties. Is the nudity in the film truly serving any other purpose than to excite the viewer? Do we absolutely need scenes of naked men together in the shower or rolling around on the bed post-party? C'mon. I don't believe for a moment that footage is there for any other reason than to arouse. Arousal is awesome. I'm all for it. But in this film I feel it screams hypocrisy. Take a look at these sad, drug-addled souls living this empty experience. Hey! Aren't they hot?!!",1155254400,6,1208,4.725118483412322
