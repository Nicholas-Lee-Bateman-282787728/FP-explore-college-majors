It would screw your brains into bits to actually pick out every symbol and hidden meaning.  But they add to the story well and above all, it is the story and the characters that make this my favorite anime, no work, ever.  Every character is beautifully flawed, easily admirable, simply relatable, and exquisite.  I love every character; even Saionji, who's violent, Nanami, who's irresolute and cruel, and Akio, who's out for himself and perhaps through his old self, his darling sister, Anthy.  If you're open minded and enjoy watching works on your television screen that plays like a poem, then pick this up and watch it over and over! By the way, I just randomly picked this DVD to comment on them but actually, I've seen the whole series already and every episode is worth watching.",1052006400,5,910,4.832258064516129
