4008532,2,B002XAZ87K,"I thought this might be interesting, but it turned out to be a joke. I sat through 26 minutes of it and after catching a lie I started taking notes. I filled a page of lies in those 26 minutes.

1) they quote a ""historian"", John Dowling saying ""50 million heretics were killed in the 600 years of the inquisition"". A blatant lie from a strong opponent of the RCC writing in 1845. The Vatican opened its archives for modern historians in the last decade, and guess what? the number is less than 5,000 people executed during the inquisition, which is by almost half per annum the executions in the state of Texas.

2) Those true Christians the ""Albigenses"", which was a hersy was persecuted by the most violent Saint Dominic and Saint Louis de Montfort. at this point I started to laugh. Anybody ever heard of the Albigenses heresy? Lets take a look at what they believed, and you can decide if they were Christian:

""A heresy during the middle ages that developed in the town Albi in Southern France.  This error taught that there were two gods:  the good god of light usually referred to as Jesus in the New Testament and the god of darkness and evil usually associated with Satan and the ""God of the Old Testament.""  Anything material was considered evil including the body which was created by Satan.  The soul, created by the good god, was imprisoned in the evil flesh and salvation was possible only through holy living and doing good works.  At death, if the person has been spiritual enough, salvation comes to the believer.  But, if the person has not been good enough, he is reincarnated as an animal or another human.  The Albigenses denied the resurrection of the body since it was considered evil."" Folks that is not from a Catholic source. And the list goes on.

This isn't even slickly packaged. The lies were so blatant that anyone with a modicum of Church history would see them as glaringly obvious.

This made for RCC haters and the ignorant.

Why did I give it 2 stars instead of just 1? It was really well produced.

If you want a fun documentary by Chris Pinto try ""Riddles in Stone"", it was interesting to watch, don't waste your time on this one.",1268179200,16,2168,4.5256410256410255

If you believe that Rome is no threat today and isn't to be regaurded as a world power in Religion and Politic's your not alone.  I'm not asking you to take me at my word, please study for yourself.  I had to look into this on my own and today I'm absolutly convinced the message in this film is accuratly presented.  I have studied this subject many times throughout my life.  I now keep up on this subject on a regular basis due to it's Importance.

This morning I spoke with Christian J Pinto for 2 hours. He's the producer of this film.  This man has a heart for the Lord and wants people to understand Gods warning against Rome. I pray this film does three things. 1) Leads people to a saving understanding Of the gospel. 2) Leads people who are under the headship of the Pope under the headship of the true head of the church Jesus Christ. 3) Teaches believers to stay clear of Rome and it's ecumenical movement.

4008535,5,B002XAZ87K,"This is the most comprehensive film regarding the history of the Bible that I have ever seen to date.  This film is easy to follow and understand.  It is constantly interjecting pictures and short dramatizations regarding the information being explained.  The script is concise and at times compelling.  This film leaves no stone unturned.

This film is extremely exhaustive with chapter titles;
The Gospel Record; The Roman Church; Dominic and the Inquisition; The Pilgrim Church; John Wycliffe; The Great Reformation; William Tyndale; Tyndale to King James;Enter The Jesuits; and The King James Bible.
It documents dates and sources from which it derives its information.  Not only does it compile its history from reliable sources...

this is perfectly scriptural in its presentation of Biblical Christianity's history.  This film is a breathe of fresh air when it comes to a solid historical viewpoint.  It does not set forth politically correct views regarding the Catholic church or their historical doctrines.  I appreciate its extra chapter regarding the KJV.  I hope that many who use modern translations see this film and appreciate the translation approach and uniqueness of this KJV.

This film is a must see by anyone slightly interested in the history of the Bible.  I whole heartily recommend this volume.",1261872000,94,1320,5.288461538461538
4008536,5,B002XAZ87K,"In the arena of Christian Filmmaking, Christian Pinto stands alone.  His films are gripping and aesthetically pleasing, constantly drawing the viewer to demand to see the next scene.  But even more, his movies are important.  His Riddles in Stone trilogy unveils the mysteries of America's beginnings and how the Masons have insinuated themselves into our history. The Megiddo series shows how every Christian has the responsibility of the Watchman as we approach the Last Days.  The Kinsey Syndrome is so compelling that every Christian and non-Christian parent in this country has not fulfilled  his responsibility until they have seen this documentary and witness the monster who is at the center of the Sexual Revolution.

And now,  Mr. Pinto has given us A Lamp in the Dark, the story of how we received the English language Bible.  Lamp follows the history of how the Bible was written and by whom.  It  progresses to the Church fathers who passed the Word of God on and preserved it under the threat of jail, torture and death.  Pinto does an excellent job telling the story of the Reformation, but just as impressively, he tells the history of the oft forgotten pre-Reformed groups such as the Waldensians, Lollards and Albigenses.

While Christians have often been persecuted by the World, they have been even more victimized by the ""established church.""  This movie is a must see for every Christian who takes the Bible seriously.",1261267200,13,1440,5.0
4008537,5,B002XAZ87K,"This film is three hours jam packed with information about the history of the Bible, and the blood that was shed so that our generation could read it.  Sadly, too few Christians really understand the sacrifice of the saints who have come before us, especially during the Inquisition era.  ""A Lamp in the Dark"" has been called a ""sure cure for Christian apathy,"" and does not pull any punches in revealing the uncomfortable truth of the Dark Ages.

The production goes on location to England and Belgium, to the British Library and the William Tyndale Museum, the site where Tyndale was strangled and burnt at the stake, and then Erasmus House in Anderlecht.  There are original interviews with the curators of these museums who explain significant facts about the history of Textus Receptus and the development of the English Bible.  There is a lot of footage of ancient manuscripts and even a replica of the jail cell where Tyndale was kept before he was put to death.  The film really gives a timeline of the Bible from the first century up through the Middle Ages, climaxing with the King James Bible of 1611, and showing that the reason Rome hates the KJV is because it represents the collective work of the Protestant Reformation.

The documentary also seems designed as a witnessing tool to Roman Catholics, since it confronts some of the key doctrines of the Catholic Church, including transubstantiation, papal authority and the veneration of Mary.  The producers were careful to focus their commentary on the teachings of the Reformers, and show clearly how the faith of modern Evangelical Christians developed by recovering the original teachings of the Bible.  Also, events of the past are often linked to modern events, showing how the Reformation continues to impact Europe and America today, through things like the European Union and the Emerging Church.  Shocking information and detailed quotes are presented about the popes, which every Christian and Catholic should know.

There is also a detailed history of the Jesuit Order and the Counter Reformation begun by them.  Some of the Jesuits history in the modern world, with the Lincoln assassination and during World War II with Hitler is also shown.

The film is done in a History Channel ""style"" with a variety of interviews cross-cut with dramatic re-enactments of certain historical events.",1260921600,131,2363,5.028205128205128
4008543,5,B002XAZ87K,"I can't say enough good things about this documentary. Finally the truth about the unholy roman catholic church comes out. The reformers did not take it back all the way to the bible though. What I mean is they did not proclaim the 7th day Shabbat, the biblical feasts of YeHoVaH, or Keeping HIs Torah. The reformers just  challenged SOME catholic teaching.  There is a second reformation taking place  today. It is those of us waking up to the fact that protestant churches are just the daughters of Rome. Protestants keep the catholic sabbath and keep catholic holidays.  Paul says don't fallow anther gospel that gospel became the Roman cathoilc church and her daughters.  According to Jude 1:3 the True gospel once delivered to the saints did not even make it out of the 1st century. in Acts 3:21 All things will be restored before Messiah Yeshua returns. In our lifetime we are witnessing the rising of the true gospel, Believers are leaving the church to fallow the Messiah as their example, keeping the Biblical 7th day Shabbat, and the Feasts of YeHoVaH in Leviticus 23.  The Biblical calendar  has been rediscovered. NOT THE MODERN JEWISH Calendar. The calendar of the father can ONLY be calculated in the land of Israel.",1520208000,2,1230,4.800947867298579

What interesting bits that are contained - and I was genuinely interested in the evolution of the different forms of Protestant Bibles - are overwhelmed by references to Catholicism that honestly I thought had died out with the Klan. The fact that the film crew could find apparent ministers to support such hyperbole is sadly depressing.

With perhaps the exception of the timeline (which isn't as much of a secret as it is just education) this film shares NO secrets. Instead it does its best to paint Catholics in general as the worst form of Christian - literally followers of the Antichrist. This is pounded on relentlessly.

There are far better, actual documentaries out there that do delve into some of the ""secrets"" such as numerology prevalent in the Bible. Sadly this one doesn't even make it out of the gate.",1519344000,,888,4.759740259740259

For example, in discussing the Albigenses, the documentary only covers a small part of their beliefs. This makes it seems like they were persecuted for their belief in the Bible. But the Albigenses held doctrines that Catholics and Protestants both find heretical--those doctrines were ignored. I prefer documentaries to provide a fuller picture, thereby allowing the viewer to reach the truth.

4008551,5,B002XAZ87K,"To say that ""I love this movie"" would be wrong.  It chilled me to my bone.  Many will understandably say that this is a ""hit piece"" on Catholicism. No matter what the bias of the creators of this movie may or may not have, there are two points that cannot be dismissed.

First, much of this is documented history. As student of the chronicling of history, I can tell that history is rewritten by each generation through that generation's own moral, political, and spiritual lenses.  We always have to look at history, not thru our own lens, but of those people and the times that the events unfolded to truly understand history in prospective. There is a now a movement across our colleges and culture that is leading people to do the exact opposite, which changes the meaning and the value of what it to be learned..

With this said, we should look for the ""arch of truth"" across history, where the hard facts reveal themselves over time. This arc cannot be denied unless someone has a completely closed mind to the result laid bare in this movie.  Men in power have feared the words of Christ .from the day He spoke them. They have sought to destroy His Word and those who hold to it.up as truth.  And when those attempts fail - and they always will - they attempt to co-opt it, by changing it, trying to make it say what they want to suit their own goals. And creating by a ""parallel"" counterfeit .church to embrace them.  Look at the government sanctioned Chinese Christian & ""Catholic"" churches within China today. - and how the growing home church movement outside of the China's control and loyal to The Word of God - is being persecuted..

The second point is simple.  If ANY Christian church is not based on the actual words and direction of Jesus, can it really call itself Christian? Really think about that, think about your church..

.If Peter, who Jesus said was to be the human rock that He would build His church upon - who denied Christ 3x and was forgiven - felt himself unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as Jesus was (according to tradition) - then what man who has come after has the right to say his words are greater or supersede those of Our Lord??  On logic alone, this is preposterous.

As a person not raised as a biblical Christian, I would implore anyone who has watched this movie and feels uncomfortable or angry to nothing more (or less)  than to pickup a King James or New Kings James Bible and read The Gospel of John.  Don't debate the past, don't hate, don't be angry, or hurt.

Read what Jesus wants to say to your heart, It will change everything :-)..",1516233600,8,2599,4.4630021141649046
4008552,5,B002XAZ87K,"Very Entertaining.  I found it to be an extremely interesting study in Revisionist History.  So many Christians today pull scripture quotations out of context to support their own beliefs.  But I have never seen anyone pull so many quotations from non-Biblical sources out of context in support of such ludicrous ""historical"" narrative.  Even the Papal quotations were all taken from anti-Catholic and Protestant sources!  As I said...a very entertaining presentation of revisionist history.",1516147200,,491,5.671232876712328

4008574,1,B002XAZ87K,"Film is a good example of how historical facts can be selectively chosen and presented to convey almost any point of view the maker (no pun intended) chooses.

This is an anti-Catholic conspirator's effort to portray ""good Christians"" as both victims and righteous. I've no doubt the Catholic Church was hostile to reform. But I do doubt there is a centuries-long conspiracy to take over governments, or the EEU, in place.

I was hoping the makers would discuss how and who  chose the texts that make up the modern Bible, including the notions that it is a mand-made book, that numerous gospels, letters, and other material was rejected, and that they would dispel rather than reinforce the notion that the book is the actual word of God, or even of the actual disciples. I was hoping too that the film would project The Bible's place in the context of other historic religious canons like The Koran to suggest how Christians' writings actually fit into a larger pattern. This film instead is a standard evangelically driven summary for the purpose of self-education. The summary is fine, but the purposes less so: there is sometimes more ignorance and danger in half facts and half-truths than in no knowledge at all.

Rather, Christians believe that God alone created the world and then man sinned rejecting God causing paradise to be come a disordered world.

It gives a voice to all the people who sacrifices themselves to make the the Scripture available to the common people. It is not a documentary against the Catholic Church, as it is in fact simply the history of what happened. My only problem is that the end seems to make a great jump in time in terms of Bible translations, going from the early KJV to the contemporary American Bible Societies. It feels as if England alone is the keeper of truth and there are a few statements made by the interviewees that, although understandable in terms of appreciation for the early scholars, do not give much credit to any other.

4008618,3,B002XAZ87K,"I was disappointed in this movie; it started out fascinating, and from a cursory viewing, factual. The presentation, however, is a bit tedious and heavy-handed. Descending from a Catholic heritage myself (though I've never been Catholic) and having many friends in that faith tradition, I cringed at many parts of the movie. In every denomination, there are points in its history that we'd like to whitewash or completely expunge, and I think we need to at least be compassionate and sensitive when we dig into the dark corners of another person's religion. To call this a history of the Bible is misleading. It starts out that way, but quickly moves into topics of the Protestant Reformation and corruption of Papal Rome. Again, I'm not disputing the historical facts presented. I'm just concerned with the way these facts are presented. I would not recommend this DVD to everyone I know, certainly.

I also found the last 15 - 20 minutes disturbing.  To insinuate that the American Bible Society is in league with the Jesuits is unfounded and, in my estimation, unconscionable.  That organization supplies the Bible in so many languages to so many people groups--and at a reasonable cost; how can anyone believe that such a work is of an evil origin?

The implications that the Jesuits created ""early"" Greek manuscripts of scripture, uncovered after the KJV was published, to attempt to discredit the accuracy of the KJV, stretches my imagination beyond its limits.  Were the Dead Sea Scrolls also planted by the Jesuits?  (Those scrolls shed light on passages that were previously somewhat confusing to Bible scholars, so more modern translations have included this new information to more accurately represent the original meaning of texts.)  The authors and producers of this movie are purportedly learned scholars of the Bible and deeply spiritual people, yet they evidently don't trust that God can preserve His Word from corruption.  Yes, there are newer versions and translations and paraphrases that may not align with our own personal faith tradition as closely as others (compare the original 1996 New Living Translation with the 2004+ revisions, and you will see the radical changes made to more closely align to Evangelical Christian teachings), but the Gospel of Jesus Christ comes through in crystal clarity in ALL Bibles.  And after all, isn't that the purpose of the Book?  ""This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations...."" [Matthew 24:14]

4008625,1,B002XAZ87K,"Christianity and history go hand in hand. The authors of the Bible dictated the words of God knowing that they were explaining and teaching the historical material. Moses understood that his five books were explaining the history of Israel, from creation up to the invasion of the Promised Land. However, heretics are heretics. There is agreement that Constantine did continue his pagan rituals, however, he still helped to further the Christian faith. Joseph told his brothers in Genesis that what they meant for evil, God used for good. Their use of the Albegensians as a good source is bad history. Though the Cathar's (Albegensians) history is dictated to us by the Catholic Church, so are the Gnostic beliefs by the early Church fathers. The truth about the Albegensians is that they were a re-birthed Gnostic group, following the Manichaeans. They held that the birth of Jesus was not real, his death and resurrection were not real. To them, Jesus was only an angel. They held that the God of the OT was evil, corrupted the creation of the earth. They held to a dualist belief, that is, they thought that the material world was evil and that man's soul needed to be set free. When you do a presentation on the history of the Bible, God's holy word, you need to do your research. Instead of presenting this as God's word, they have now introduced the notion of Gnosticism into the reading and understanding of the Bible. You must be very careful when watching this video.

To say the inquisitors did not torture and murder protestants, is like saying Hitler/Germany did not murder millions of Jews.

But I cannot call objective a film which spends two and half hours making the claim the Pope is the antichrist without interviewing any Catholic Priests, or providing any counter voice whatsoever.  Further, the title is misleading.  While it does give some cursory history of the evolution of the Bible, it's printing in various languages and wide dissemination, early in the film, most of the time is filled with tale after tale of how demonic all Catholics were (are) and how saintly all Protestants were.  Many of them seem well outside of what historians would accept as plausible.  History and society have viewed the Catholic Church with a great deal of criticism in modern times, much of it likely deserved, but some of these tales I have not heard advanced by anyone.  Again, I am not a scholar, but that is my take.  If you are into Church intrigue, you may find this interesting, or at least hear some stories you would like to research on your own.

This is historically accurate with a good broad sweep with good detail of those involved on both sides both as individuals and the groups they were a part of.

Because, ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"", all of us and all churches (including me and mine) have flawed histories. I learned a lot from this video but noticed the absence of any mention of Martin Luther's antisemitism which likely had a greater influence than the Catholic Church on contributing to the Holocaust. Also, there was no mention of John Calvin's involvement in the execution of Michael Servetus. No doubt, these are not the only skeletons in the Protestant Churches' closets. Ever since Cain killed Abel, any excuse to kill is good enough. Again, I would really like to have a history of the Bible without a polemic agenda.",1484956800,2,782,4.633093525179856
4008660,2,B002XAZ87K,"I expected to dislike this movie.  It has elements which are conspiratorial, always a sign of lying -- yet the actual text and statements made, barring some of the dates stated, one can verify objectively.

To me, this matters a bunch cuz back in February 2016, a friend of mine used my since-2008 study of Bible meter, to claim that Matt24-25 is one TIMED PROPHECY in the original Greek.  I've spent many hours since (see my Matt24 playlist in Youtube as Brain Outy) documenting whether or not that claim is true.

It is.  But I have left out elements in it while documenting the year-by-year (1syllable=1year) in Bible timed prophecies, starting in Genesis1.. those elements are in this film.  I cannot determine whether the writers/producers/commenters in the film know Bible uses timed prophecies via syllable counts.  The idea is as old as the Reformation, and of course being used by the original Bible writers was known to everyone getting those books as they came out since Moses;  still, to find so much more info in this film, is both heartening to fill out the parts of time I don't cover in the videos showing the Greek text.. and also, upsetting.

I'm not a conspiracy buff.  But it's hard to contradict the film when the info provided, is provable.  I docked one star for the conspiratorial slant, but that's a style complaint. I did have to dock two more stars for the movie's stupid condemnation of Aleph and Beta, Westcott and Hort in its final half-hour, since by that point this movie is obviously a plug for the KJV being special.  But, as with anything else, you cut out the bad and learn from what's right.

The sequel and the end of THIS movie, are wacko in contending that Sinaiticus and Vaticanus are somehow inventions of the Catholic Church.  Proves that the claimants cannot READ the manuscripts at all.  Those of us who are indeed anti-Catholic but who ROUTINELY read Bible in the original mss, can attest to the age, cuz you can TELL from just READING, even as you can tell Shakespeare from Beyonce lyrics.  Sad, that the movie started do well and then turns into sheer trash in the last half hour.  Sequel is even worse.  No point reviewing that.

For as you'll see in the many videos I do USING the original mss, the ORIGINAL WORD OF GOD was indeed provably preserved in its very SYLLABLE COUNTS which to this day the Catholic Church (nor the Protestants) even KNOW about.  For example, Luke 21 provably monitors the syllable counts in Matt24, to craft Luke's Chapter 21, and so does Paul in Eph1, Peter in 1 Peter, John in Rev17.  Oh well.  What a difference it makes when you can actually READ the mss versus some translation which cannot ever match the syllable counts, let alone the full meaning in the God-inspired original.

Not covered, is the fact that 'Seven Mountains', a virulent Protestant sect of mainstream US Christianity backing Trump and adhered to by everyone 'Christian' you see on TV and radio.. the sect has exactly the same damnable agenda as this movie depicted for the Catholic Church during the Counter Reformation, and prior.  So the movie, while at times hard to hear, has a current topical value.

Christ of course predicted all this, as the 42nd video in my Matt24 playlist begins to explain.  Videos are still ongoing, to demonstrate the validity of interpretation.  You make of them what you will, but in all events this movie proves currently relevant.",1484352000,,3416,4.716694772344013

So this documentaries is saying a log of BAD MOUTHING FOR ROMAN CATHOLICS BUT FULL OF FLOWERY COMMENTS OF PROTESTANTS. WORST TO MAKE THEM LOOK MORE VICTIM AND ROMAN CATHOLIC AS A MURDERER. It is a very eye opening on how really evil works. Sorry but this is not what a bible documentaries are. This is just one of those unethical and disrespectful documentaries of men about catholics. I don't memorize the bible verse but when I do read a bible I do it sincerely and respectfully. The bible I know is God's words and I trust in them. I know my bible but I trust God words but not men's words. Sorry but this fails to make me hate Roman catholics or pope or even rethink that Protestants biblical comments of dark ages or untold stories..it made me more think that this documentaries sold hatred and anger towards Roman catholics.

They focus on the different manuscripts used in non-King James translations and try to associate them with Roman Catholics, especially the Jesuits.
They fail to understand that scholars study not only the codices but papyrus that are much older than the 4 manuscripts used by Erasmus that were no later than 14th century, but also Greek & Hebrew manuscripts of much earlier dates.
 Interesting that the King James translations did not even use the latest Greek version as compiled by Erasmus.

They also fail to understand that the King James Bible was little more than a revision of its predecessor the older Bishop's Bible.

Interesting that the Geneva Bible was a competitor of the King James and was used by those that sailed on the Mayflower.

Frankly from a spiritual perspective, those that advocate the KJV possess that spirit that endeavored to keep the Bible from being translated into the vernacular as they simply do not want people to gain an understanding of the Word of God. The English of the King James (most today are of the fourth edition) is outdated and in some places hard to understand.

I think we as Christians that live in America with our smartphones and tablets take for granted applications like YouVersion which put the word of God at our fingertips without cost and without fear.

Yet this prophecy is not ultimately about ancient Babylon (Iraq), but the Mystery Babylon of Revelation. Ancient Babylon was simply a type of the Last-Days Babylon.

4008804,1,B002XAZ87K,"A thinly disguised anti Catholic piece with too many historical mistakes to count. The Bible was canonized by the Catholic Church.
The Catholic Church decided which books to place in the Bible. The film speaks of the ""Bible"" but there wasn't a ""Bible yet (there was scripture, but no Bible until the Catholic Church put it together). The very first book created off a printing press was a Catholic Bible created by Catholics. I suppose people can believe whatever untruths hey wish.  But this movie isn't even a good portrayal of the lies.
Catholic priest, Saint Jerome said, ""Ignorance of Scripture is Ignorance of Christ."" He was allowed to live in a cave below the church that covered the birthplace of Jesus and copy the Bible into 2 languages people could read (including Latin)  - and he was Catholic.

 There are seven ""extra"" books in the Catholic Bible (the New Testaments are the same in Catholic and Protestant Bibles.

HOWEVER, it was Martin Luther who REMOVED books from the Old Testament which had been used as ""The Bible"" for almost 1000 years.  Luther wanted to remove the Books of James and Revelation, but others stopped him from doing this.

Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Judith, Tobit, Wisdom of Solomon, and Sirach were put into the Bible in the 300's.  They were approved at the Councils of Hippo in 393 AD, and the Council of Carthage in 397 AD.  Look it up!  They were written in Greek, so the Hebrew speaking Jews didn't consider them to be from God.  However, the Greek speaking Jews at the time did, and they remain in their bible to this day.

Luther, some 1100 years later, removed them from the Bible, under his own authority (infallible?), because they didn't agree with his own personal opinion of what the Bible should have said.

 Protestants adhere to the Catholic Tradition of having 27 books in the New Testament, which was also decided at the Councils of Hippo and Carthage in the late 4th Century, but then strangely disbelieve the Catholic Church when it comes to the Old Testament.

The Old Testament Book (Catholic Bible)  ""Wisdom of Solomon""  is actually mentioned in the New Testament, in Luke 11:31 and Matthew 12:42.

An interesting coincidence is that the Protestant Bible has 66 books in it.

Six is the number of incompleteness in the Bible, as in 666.  The Catholic Bible has 73 books in it. 7 is the number of completion (God rested on the 7th day after creation, 7 Sacraments, 7 days in the week, forgive someone 7 times 70, etc.).

Three is the number of the Blessed Trinity.",1458172800,12,2525,4.680272108843537

4008835,1,B002XAZ87K,"Sorry. I thought this was very poorly done. Not necessarily the information, but the presentation. I will not comment on the contents, as many here have already done so.

My complaint is that the narration was very annoying to listen to. The narrator can hardly say more than a handful of words before pausing. Pausing can be very effectively used to make something clear, to emphasis or create anticipation. But when every few words are followed by a slight pause, without any modulation in ones tone, pitch, pace or power throughout an entire 3 hour documentary, then it becomes a mannerism that is very distracting. I just had a difficult time listening to the message given. The interviewers and other spoken words are fine.

The other disappointment  I had, is for a documentary made in 2009 the picture quality was rather poor.

Unfortunately, the sequel Tare Among the Wheat is not much better as far as these two points are concerned.",1454544000,,942,4.832298136645963

4008843,5,B002XAZ87K,"The documentary is in fact worth every second!  After watching this, I immediately thought of writing a review, something I rarely do.  But before writing a review, I read a few negative reviews and found that people felt ""offended"" by this video. Sorry, but truth be said.  I took notes on important quotes as I watched it:
""That is the Pope that hath his power out of hell and cometh thence..."" -- 1560 Geneva Bible, footnote on Rev. 11:7""It has been claimed that when Luther recognized the Papacy as anti-Christ, it was only then that the Reformation gained momentum."" -- That Man of Sin: Dead or Alive, byt Dr. Ian R.K. Pasley, EIPS article""And call no man your father upon the earth, for one is your father which is in heaven."" Mathew 23:9""The Pope holdeth place on earth, not simply of a man, but of the true God.""-- Pope Innocent 3rd. Decretals of Gregory IX, Book 1, chapter 3. I am in all, and above all, so that God himself, and I, the vicar of God, hath both one consistory, and I am able to do almost all that God can do.  I then, being above all...seem by this reason to be above all gods."" -- Pope Nicholas, The Church Historians of England: Reformation Period, by Josiab Pratt, pub. 1856, p. 159""Wherefore, no marvel if it be in my power to dispense with all things, yea, with the precepts of Christ."" Pope Nicholas.  Ibid, Pratt, p. 159""Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it...and no man openeth..."" Jesus Christ, Revelation 3:8, 7""If any man...or an angel from heaven...preach any other gospel unto you...let him be accursed."" Apostle John, Galatians 1:9, 8""Our Lord God the Pope."" Catholics.  The Beast and His Image, by Frederic Fysh, pub. 1837, p. 276""Take care that we lose not that salvation, that life and breath which thou hast given us, for thou art shepherd, thou art physician, thou art governor, thou art husbandman, thou, finally are ANOTHER GOD ON EARTH.""  --The Lateran Council while addressing Pope Julius 2nd.  Lateran Coucil, cited by Dr. Ian R.K. Paisley, The Bible of the Antichrist, p. 2""The Pope is not simply the representative of Jesus Christ: On the contrary, he is Jesus Christ Himself, under the veil of the flesh.  Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ who is speaking.  Hence...when anyone speaks of the Pope, it is not necessary to examine but to obey."""" -- Pope Pius X (Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto).""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the father, but by me.""  Jesus.  John 14:6""I alone...am the successor of the apostles, the vicar of Jesus Christ...

Matthew 24:4-5CONFESSION TO BECOME A CATHOLIC:""We confess that whatever new thing the Pope of Rome may have instituted whether it be in scripture or out of scripture, is true, divine, and full of salvation and, therefore, ought to be regarded as of higher value by lay people than even the precepts of the living God.. We confess that the Pope has power of altering scripture, or increasing, or diminishing it according to his will. W confess that the most holy pontiff ought to be honored by all with divine honor, with more prostration than even what is due to Christ himself."" --  Apocalyptic Sketches, or Lectures on the book of revelation by John Cumming, 1851, P. 308The question that all christinas should ask is: ""after thousand years of persecuting and killing the saints for reading the holy Scriptures, has Rome now turned over a new leaf?

4008845,5,B002XAZ87K,"Excellent video documentary which gives us a detailed history of the Bible's movement from Hebrew and Greek languages to the Latin version of the Roman Catholic churches and finally to the English-and-German-and-modern-language versions that the Protestant Reformation gave to the world-- not omitting matters relevant to the massive and horrifying persecution of early Bible-believers who opposed the Latin-only policy of the Roman Catholic churches by actually translating the Holy Scriptures into English and German, etc., so that the great masses of common people could finally READ the Holy Scriptures of the Bible in a language they could UNDERSTAND. I've heard Chris Pinto's Christian radio show quite a number of times now (via internet MP3 downloads) at Brannon Howse's site for ""Worldview Weekend Radio,"" and I've always found Mr. Pinto's Christian history commentaries there to be quite enlightening... so I was pleased to be able to see this video documentary he created. I will next be watching the sequel video, which is called ""Tares Among The Wheat."" For people who are Protestants like myself (a Baptist) but who might be interested in learning about some more recent defections from the Roman Catholic religion (by former Roman Catholic priests, in recent and modern times), I will also mention that I have recently bought 3 paperbacks from Amazon that I am now reading and find quite fascinating: 1) Far From Rome, Near To God-- Testimonies Of Fifty Converted Catholic Priests... edited by Richard Bennett and Martin Buckingham, 2) The Gospel According To Rome-- Comparing Catholic Tradition And The Word Of God... by James G. McCarthy, and 3) Catholicism, East Of Eden... by Richard Bennett. All of them are recommended and all will be found, upon a thorough reading,  to be quite illuminating. Chris Pinto, the narrator, writer, and director of this video, is a former Catholic himself, if I remember correctly from my previous times auditing his Christian radio program.",1451520000,,1992,5.28391167192429

This is coming from someone who has spent years studying the History of the Christian Church (especially the Protestant Reformation) and I can say first hand that no serious academic would approve of what was said, demonstrated, or elaborated upon within this so called documentary. Any student of Church History whether your Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Armenian, Coptic, Syrian, or assyrian church of the east would not take any of these claims seriously. I would suggest he get a proper education on the history as well as sound pieces of historical scholarhsip to read. My guess is this person was one of those Catholics who was poorly catechized and not given a proper education on the Sacraments so he ""got saved"" down the street at Pastor Bob's local Baptist Church and this then changed his life (and it really could have, and that's great, but that doesn't make you right about all this either).

Seemed like a good video at first ... I often stop documentaries to go check the ""facts""; at the beginning a few checked out and I learn a couple of things - including some interesting things the video doesn't mention which would have discredited their use of that ""fact"". It gets worse as they use unsound reasoning (information bias) and instead of referencing original sources they quote from second hand sources. For instance: quoting someone's quote of another source instead of referencing that source to begin with. That makes it hard to go look things up and see if the original source actually said what they claim. Another type of faulty reasoning employed: They imply that since certain well known reformers thought and said certain things, you should too.

I could not finish watching since the video went from bible history to an expose of the Catholic church and personal interpretation of historical events, which I would be OK with IF they were honest about their intent, title, description, references and interpretation of their information so that potential viewers would know what they are getting into and so that the simple who believe everything would not be deceived.

When any ""source"" of information uses the devil's tactics (lying and deception mixed with partial truths) I have to wonder who and what the real source of the video is and what their true agenda is. John Chapter 8:41-45 Jesus tells us that you will do the deeds of your father and that the devil is the father of lies. The makers of this video need to do some serious soul searching, better yet, truth searching or they are no better than the people they are trying to expose!

Instead of being neutral to the Catholic vs. Protestant debate it continues to perpetuate fallacies against The Roman Catholic Church.  As you can see this documentary was purposely done in a fashion which is very biased and Anti-Roman Catholic with out showing both sides of the arguments.  This documentary is filled from beginning to end with Anti-Roman Catholic rhetoric. The accusations against Thomas More also known in the Roman Catholic Church as St. Thomas More are unfounded and completely false.  It was King Henry VIII who hunted down William Tyndale and had him executed for heresy!

This video is filled with abhorrent lies.  For one King Edward VI was a child who was completely manipulated by the powerful Protestant faction in England.  Basically he was a puppet child King. Also these accusation that the RCC is the Whore of Babylon are very offensive and beyond the pale.  And lets not forget all of the false quotes the Popes supposedly made in this documentary which are a complete fallacy.  The Popes never made any of these phony statements which have been fabricated! These made up statements go against the official teaching of the RCC and the encyclical writings of the Popes themselves.  The Popes just like all other Clergyman are here to minister the Holy Sacraments instituted by Christ himself in the New Testament.

If anyone doubts my review all they have to do is check The Catechism of the RCC and the teachings of the Magisterium and compare them to the cheezy phony sources this documentary provides for the quotes the Popes made. Also all the Popes encyclicals are public knowledge. This documentary undermines the reality that the Vatican has had since the time of the Apostles the best manuscripts in Codex Vaticanus.  Vatican library is a treasure of human knowledge that is now being used by all scholars indiscriminately. This whole video is a completer and utter farce. Even the ludicrous misinterpretation by Protestants of the Biblical passage ""Call no man Father, but your Father in Heaven"" was definitely not to be interpreted literally as Protestants wrongly do.  If that were the case than you can't even call your biological father, father. Boy Protestants have no understanding of Theology.  Again this documentary is complete and utter nonsense! There is a lot of ignorance and hatred that still lingers with many Protestants and those former Roman Catholics who never searched the TRUTH in their own faith!  David Brown and other contributors are poorly informed on Church history.

David Brown goes as far as saying that RCC labeled the Waldensians and Albigensians as Donatist.  The Donatists existed hundreds of years earlier during the time of Augustine of Hippo!  Separate issues where being dealt with each group.  The Waldensians did not believe in Transubstantiation and Purgatory.  The Albigensians were Dualists.  And the Donatist group who came from the North African countries  of (Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt) were a Schismatic group that broke from the rest of the early Churches during the Christian Persecutions under the Emperor Diocletian.

Donatism was an indirect outcome of Diocletian's persecutions. The governor of Africa had been lenient towards the large Christian minority under his rule during the persecutions. He was satisfied when Christians handed over their Scriptures as a token of repudiation of their faith. Some Christians acceded to this convenient action. When the persecutions came to an end, however, they were branded traditores (traitors), ""those who handed (the holy things) over"" by the zealous, mostly from the poorer classes.

Like the Novatianist schism of the previous century, the Donatists were rigorists, holding that the church must be a church of ""Saints,"" not ""Sinners,"" and that sacraments, such as Baptism, administered by traditores were invalid sacraments.  Augustine of Hippo proved by Holy Writ that this was not the case and that the sacraments consecrated by these clergyman were valid despite the clergyman being branded traditores(traitors).

I definitely do not recommend this documentary on the Bible, based on the aforementioned reasons!",1403481600,10,4391,5.2371428571428575

4008973,1,B002XAZ87K,"A DVD dedicated to a Propaganda that promotes a mythical church that never existed.  The type of DVD is expressly for the Sheeple -- (Sheeple (a portmanteau of ""sheep"" and ""people"") is a term that highlights the herd behavior of people by likening them to sheep, a herd animal.  The term is used to describe those who voluntarily acquiesce to a suggestion without critical analysis or research.--quoted from the Dictionary).  The Albigenses (12 and 13th century) and the Waldenses (Peter Waldo- Originated in the 12th century) --  Definition of WALDENSES: a Christian sect arising in southern France in the 12th century, adopting Calvinist doctrines in the 16th century, and later living chiefly in Piedmont.  In this time and as early as the fall of Rome, the peasantry worked 7 days a week.  The only hope the peasant had was at the end of life was to go to heaven.  Contradictory movements were met with extreme results before the Rome Pope could act.  After all the only hope out of this world is heaven and a message that lead to the French invention of the Albigenses and Waldenses saying that you have to leave the Apostolic Church for their way is the only way out was not the hope of the time.  Not possible that the peasantry would believe the Albigenses or the Waldenses from the 12th century.  This DVD does state that the Rome Church did chose to separate from One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church in 1054.  Thus the Roman Church separated from the Christian East and made unto itself its own separate church.  This DVD completely leaves out that the Rome Church was being run by disregarded European royalty and Large Commercial Families.  The Roman Church has gone through its own Reformation and the Roman Church does not rule countries any more; governments do that now.  The only recommendation for this DVD is that it does have in it historical data that is not covered in the Class rooms of government schools.  Only if you have a History back ground and know basic facts of the total development of the Christian Church would this DVD be a recommendation.  Baptist, Mormons, Jehovah Witness and other invented groups that claim a divine origin also claim the Albigenses and Waldenses fiction as their historical record.  After the fall of Rome, groups were separated from the Church and the Scholars of scripture.  They made their own theology up, to include animals speaking at Christmas and other strange tails.  Would you want to believe that a separate church existed in Europe and also used the Roman Italic Latin Bible?

4008977,4,B002XAZ87K,"It is hard to distinguish between the truth and conjecture when it comes to the Protestant verses the Catholic perspective. So much of this comprehensive program is biased towards the Protestant point of view. The other reviewers are correct concerning their statements about Christianity's bloody past, especially during the Dark Ages. The Holy Book was something considered very sacred and had been for a thousand years or so and the Church did not take kindly to others giving their private interpretation. I think this DVD shows the struggles concerning religious points of view and man's inhumanity to man. Fortunately, today we have come to a better understanding of the motivations behind the Reformers and hopefully Catholics and Protestants can come together and stand together in a world where any believer in Christ is increasingly under attack. Make of the viewpoints what you will. It is always hard to know exactly what happened during many time periods. We owe the Reformers for putting the Bible into everyone's hands written in their own vernacular. We owe the Catholic church and people like Saint Patrick for protecting the Bible through various councils, priests and monks. We can also thank the Catholic church for its controversial Crusades.

If you are seeking the truth about the history of Christianity from it's beginning to now This is a very good documentary to explain it. I also would like to recommend another part to this series that I've just learned about. it's called "" Tares among the Wheat"". This too is also an excellent guide to the truth of Christianity and how it's emerged into what it is today that is the main stream version of Christianity. You need to watch them with an open mind, don't go by how you have been taught because for most of us it might get upset if you have strict beliefs. Lamp in the dark gives a good description of how our bibles have evolved into what it is today. The history of how it got this way. And lets you know about the lives of those to helped write them. Tares in the wheat it too continues on with more information that the Lamp in the dark just didn't have time enough to explain. From what I've been told there is a third part. I believe it mentions that in the credits at the end. These are documentary's that most churches would not like it if you were to watch it. So if you dare to find the truth on your own, rather than rely on your church, and blindly follow. Myself I follow the bible and look up what people say to be fact and I follow what the word says. ( 1 Thessalonians 5:21 prove all things; hold fast that which is good; ) I believe in the bible and follow that as my guide. The King James/ The Geneva Bible/ and the NIV are good ones for study. I like using them as my guide rather than to trust my soul to someone that collects tithe every Sunday. Mainly cause that's their motivation to their version of their truth. The digital copy the instant video on Amazon works excellent on here and I believe you could rent it instead of buying. This is an excellent documentary not a Hollywood production.

Prior to that time, Christians were limited to priests (clergy) interpreting/explaining the bible for them, and were forbidden to read the Latin bible for themselves.

4008996,1,B002XAZ87K,"1. This ""documentary"" starts its argument at 313AD jumping from the crucifixion to Constantine.  They do not discuss what was taught by the Apostles throughout all Christendom as they traveled throughout the world preaching the truth of Jesus Christ.  What was the Catholic (universal) Church doing for over 200 years?  They Apostles didn't have a New Testament to use as instruction manual for the Early Church.  They taught by example and established traditions. They make no mention of the documentation of Eusebius (Died 339 AD) Polycarp (lived during the time of the Apostles) and Ignatius (disciple of John and Bishop of Antioch).
2. Video time 12:58 Constantine:  There were Popes (Fathers...pope means father) and Bishops long before Constantine.  James, brother of Jesus, was the very first Bishop, and specifically the first Bishop of Jerusalem.  In Acts chapter 15 they have James making a judgment regarding preaching to the Gentiles and their conversion.  James, the Bishop, made the judgment.  Not Peter or Paul, both present.  They completely ignore all the other churches and completely focus on Rome.  Yes Rome was one of the hubs but so were Jerusalem and Antioch...what were the Christians doing there?
3. Now we have HUGE jump from Constantine in the 3rd century to the Inquisition in the 13th century.  900 years with lots of things happening during that gap.  The Dark Ages was call that because the Roman empire had collapsed but it wasn't the Dark Ages everywhere, it was in Europe.  Christendom was still continuing to function.  During that gap the following took place:
* 325 1st Ecumenical Counsel: Excommunication of Arius who taught that Jesus did not always exist...that there was a time ""when the Son was not"" . They also introduced the Nicene Creed
* 367 (not a counsel) First official list of the Canon of Scripture
* 381 2nd Ecumenical Counsel: Finalized the Nicene Creed
* 397 (not a counsel) Finalized canon of scripture including Apocrypha
* 431 3rd Ecumenical Counsel: Repudiated Nestorianism which wanted to call Mary the Christotokos (Christ bearer) rather than Theotokos (God bearer) because he held the two natures of Christ were completely separate not one.
* 531 4th Ecumenical Counsel: Declared the 5 Apostolic Sees repudiated monophysitism (Christ divine only not fully God fully man)
* 553 5th Ecumenical Counsel: Reaffirmed previous councils and condemned new Arian, Nestorian and Monophsite doctrines
* 680-81 6th Ecumenical Counsel:  Reputed monotheilitism which said Jesus only had the divine will not the human will.
* 787 Ecumenical Counsel: Restoration of veneration of icons

And these discrepencies took place just in the first 15 minutes.  If we actually look at what was taught to the Churches by the Apostles we have a very different understanding of the Early Church.  This was certainly not an unbiased presentation.  The ""experts"" believed things based on...what?  They didn't share any resources used to come to the conclusions they came to. If you want to know about the Early Church, don't take their word for it, and don't take mine either, research it for yourselves.  Read documentation by people who were eye witnesses. I'm sure you can clearly see I am not a theologian, but I am a Christian who has struggled to find the Truth...not ""truth"" of my own making based on my own assumptions.  I have felt the frustration when centuries of Christianity were left out because what the Early Church did didn't fit in with the doctrine being taught by the Protestant churches I attended. I have been stunned by my pastor sharing they only spent 2 days on 1100 years of Church history in seminary, jumping from the death of John to the reformation. How can we be certain we have the truth if we don't look at the whole of our Christian history? I am not Roman Catholic. I was Protestant for 30 years before converting to Eastern Orthodox Christianity.",1355443200,50,3913,5.00462962962963
4008997,1,B002XAZ87K,"This dvd ""A Lamp in the dark"" is portrayed as telling ""the unknown History of the Bible""--This dvd should be renamed ""what,s wrong with the catholic church""--Now I,m a twice born King James,pre-millenial,fundamental,independant Baptist and the stuff told here is true,but how its told is quite another story. I am quite literally ashamed of this movie.

The producers use the title ""untold history of the Bible"" as a springboard to unmercifully bash catholics right and left. True there is some history of the Bible in this dvd and how it developed,But wow,does this movie ever smash and badmouth the catholics--How do you win them by doing this?--I could see discussing the catholic belief,s using the Word of God in a civil way--but this???

Finally near the end the movie it slow,s down the bashing long enough to finish the history of the King James Bible,but the producers of this movie omit incredibly important information such as the italic,s the translators used in differentiating the translated Greek and Hebrew an and the  multiple revisions of the King James Version.

Also omitted are the Bible verses that clarify why there is one preserved Bible version in today,s world and that version is kept by the power of God.

This command refers to rash, censorious, and unjust judgment. See Romans 2:1. Luke 6:37 explains it in the sense of ""condemning."" Christ does not condemn judging as a magistrate, for that, when according to justice, is lawful and necessary. Nor does he condemn our ""forming an opinion"" of the conduct of others, for it is impossible ""not"" to form an opinion of conduct that we know to be evil. But what he refers to is a habit of forming a judgment hastily, harshly, and without an allowance for every palliating circumstance, and a habit of ""expressing"" such an opinion harshly and unnecessarily when formed. It rather refers to private judgment than ""judicial,"" and perhaps primarily to the customs of the scribes and Pharisees.

4009003,1,B002XAZ87K,"As Catholic who dabbled in Protestantism, it's stuff like this that made me really examine the Church history and come back to Catholicism.  I don't care what anyone says they'll always have different interpretations of Christianity and how it should be structured. Such was the case in the early days of the Church. The Catholics are rightfully documented as not having the best history. Unfortunately as they grew larger, so too did their humanistic quest for greed and power. And I shouldn't say ""their"" because it was not all Catholics that thought this way. The documentary makes some very bold claims in that the church itself had a satanic front that continues to this day to bring about the Antichrist or literally is the Antichrist. Most of these theories started by the likes of Dave Hunt years ago have began to lost their thunder and have been outright disproven. Much of the christian morals/customs even today are structured on the customs the Roman Catholic Church created. Last time I checked I haven't seem too many Protestant  churches denouncing celebrating christmas on Dec 25th.

My main issue on the film was it was solely based on bashing the Catholics, which again was the most dominating Christian presence at the time. There is no real or fair debate on the history of the Bible in this film.  Mr. Pinto vaguely even describes how the book was structured and assembled and barely mention that Catholics do get credit for building the model of the Bible we know today. I say not so balanced because then he definitely nit picks from obscure sources. He also totally ignores the positive impact the church had on the world. He doesn't tell you that key reformers such as Martin Luther who is praised throughout, had a number of outlandish quotes of denouncing the Old Testament all together and straight up altering the Bible's content. My point is absolute power in any mortal hands will corrupt on some length of the chain. Thank God Martin Luther's ideas didn't take over or we'd have NO OLD TESTAMENT IN THE BIBLE!!! Here's a quote I just read in an independent magazine (Whistle Blower WND.com) about Martin Luther regarding the Jews that you won't hear mentioned by Pinto ""On the Jews and their Lies...We are at fault in not slaying them..."" As critical as Pinto is to direct quotes, I'd love for him to just be fair about it. JUST BE FAIR MR. PINTO! Anything else is simply unethical and is a product of disinformation. Here's a link to some other outrageous quotes from Luther
[...]

I was really searching for balanced portrayal and in some ways this really hurt my view of Chris Pinto's work. It me question if this is where he gets his theories how much else of his material is built on straw houses. His radio show is filled daily how the Catholic Church is essentially the Antichrist and is looking to take over the world. What else is new. This has been talked about for centuries and yet the biggest thing we Catholics are looking today at a local level is how to help the Community. Look around you and tell me if the Catholics are growing in numbers or if they're morals of pro life anti homosexuality is catching on. It's the complete opposite if anything where the emerging church movement made up of mostly Protestants is under riding the Church. I'm should add that I'm hardly anti-protestent as I own and support a great deal of Protestant publications/dvds. To see such a production dealing with ""corruption's"" in the Protestant church, check out the Submerging Church...Excellent Documentary.

He uses the same old conjecture of why do catholics worship mary, call their pastors father, worship idols ect all of which are so ignorantly misunderstood and shows he either did no real research or is simply trying to sway the viewer.
I will say it's well worth the time watching it to get some historical background of the early Church, but just realize this is HARDLY the full history of the Bible. Even Alex Jones who promoted this dvd eventually took it off his shelves. And if you watch his interview with Chris you'll find that when he pushes Chris for answers, he replies ""Well it's a complicated issue"". Sure it is Chris. Trying to sum up the history of the Oldest Christian Church. If you want a REAL hisotry of Catholicism, check out the Catholicism DVD series by Fr. Baron.

There's just way too much out there that is blatant anti Chrisitian and for people like Pinto to put all his energy into anti Catholicism (a trinitarian bible believing Christian religion) seems like a waste of time. But I guess when your whole career is built on the same hypothesis than you have no choice.",1328054400,15,4638,4.725587144622992

Don't the producers realise that you can't get away with this type of historical revision any more? It would take only five minutes on the internet to start to unravel the web of lies this video attempts to sell. Utterly shameful and i really hope the producers are held to account for this gross bigoted propaganda video. Why call it a history of the Bible? This video totally skips over the first 400 years of the Church when the various books of the Bible were written and brought together in the Canon of Scripture we now call the Bible. How and why were the some books accepted and some rejected? What did the early Church do before the Bible was freely available? This video doesn't mention any of this. Why? I guess because that would show the Catholic Church in a good light and if you are a foam at the mouth Catholic basher you couldn't have a little thing like the truth and historical accuracy spoiling your fun. It seems the only mission of this video is to portray Catholics in the worst possible light, so vast chunks of History are omitted. What is left is either spun or straight up lies are inserted. This DVD should really be called 'The Catholic Haters version of History'.
If you think the Catholic Church is viciously evil and you want that view reinforced and given respectability by a well produced documentary then you will love this DVD.

4009014,5,B002XAZ87K,"The producer (John Doerr) and the director (Christian J. Pinto) should be very proud of their effort.  The DVD is well written, documented, and acted out.  If you've ever wondered why so much confusion exits within Christian churches and teaching this DVD will help sort it out.

It should be in the collection of any Christian who's serious about his/her faith!",1294444800,11,362,4.901639344262295
4009015,5,B002XAZ87K,"AS the other films, this was very well done! As a former Catholic I found it intruging and nessacary. The film gives a great perspective on a religon many never question for themselves. I know many catholic people,who are good GOD loving folks,but just wish they would take a closer look at the religion they follow. Open up the KJ and read! As a young girl I found herasys with the catholic religion right away.....look at the 2nd commandment the The Second Commandment
""You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments."" Exodus 20:4-6

I realized as a little girl the catholic church is full of them! The Roman Catholic ""Church"" Purposely takes out
one of God's Ten Commandments

4009016,5,B002XAZ87K,"This is an outstanding overview of how the various translations of the Bible came about, and why. I was moved to learn more about those faithful and courageous individuals who labored to deliver God's Word to the common man, in their common  language...many of whom paid the ultimate price for defying man's law, which tried to keep the Bible locked away from the ""pigs,"" as commoners were then considered (alluding to the scriptural injunction, ""Cast not your pearls before swine."") I was also shocked to learn about the potent forces still active today, ever-intent on corrupting God's Word and ensnaring the unsuspecting.

I was somewhat disappointed by not learning more about how the earliest writings came to be compiled into the finished form we have today, but obviously, that exceeded the scope of the project.

All in all, though - with few exceptions - I was riveted through the entire three hours and definitely plan to buy more copies to share with others.  Based on my experience as a teacher, I would not recommend this for elementary-age students.",1291420800,29,1063,4.955056179775281

It sure makes me more appreciative than ever of how simply I can go to the store and purchase any Bible in any version I prefer not to mention study materials galore!  I have God's Word today because of much blood that was shed in order to make that happen.  I have the true Gospel to save and sustain me because of the blood of the martyrs.  One certainly cannot take the Word of God for granted.",1277769600,11,452,4.1022727272727275

8383560,1,B002XAZ87K,"THIS MOVIE DOESN'T BELONG ON AMAZON ! It is NOT a DOCUMENTARY!
I'm not Catholic but this is bashing Catholics, right there I begin to doubt how factual it is. The ""narrator"" sound like it's computer generated because every sentence has the same rhythm which gets annoying.  A lot of the ""acting"" is very amateurish, in the level of those films done by a small church.  I don't mind an amateur film if it's true.  Because I don't watch most mass marketed violent films,  I frequently end up watching independent films etc.  Just when you add all this together, it doesn't add up to a quality film, which leads me to doubt it's ""experts"" etc.  It reminds me of those You Tube films that twist all kinds of facts.
  I watched almost 2 hours out of 2h 58m over several days.  At this point I quit,  I can't trust anything it says to be true.  It's just a waste of time.  I don't remember it starting out with stuff seeming like lies, or I wouldn't have hung in so long.  But it's like taffy that begins to stretch further and further.....
  On the Amazon page, there is no information provided on the film, about it's experts, info on the ""church"" that made it etc.  IT'S YOU TUBE TRASH !
  Part 2 of this movie Tares Among the Wheat, I am passing on that because this was so bad.
