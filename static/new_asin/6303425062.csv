7846491,5,6303425062,"This is my favorite movie with Amanda Wyss when she has the most beautiful and natural look without makeup before moving on to other movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, Silverado, & Shakma.  She plays 16 year old Tobi Jensen who decides to travel from Ohio to San Francisco (the home of Dirty Harry Callahan & The Doobie Brothers) to find and meet her mother (Loni Anderson) for the first time in 13 years after her father unfortunately dies.  Tobis voice during the time she meets and gets acquainted with her mother for the first time after 13 years sounds so beautiful and soft when she is so happy about the meaningful moment.  The first few minutes are my favorite part of the movie until she discovers the truth about her mothers secret life as a high priced call girl, which is when her voice begins to change when she is enraged with anger.  Then it becomes sad and depressing when Tobi begins to feel unloved and unwanted by her mother who cannot commit to her responsibilities as a parent.  Its even worse when her mother explains the truth about her birth and father.  Furthermore, it comes even frightening when Tobi turns to the streets, gets mugged and loses all her belongings she had to survive by, and then unfortunately gets lured into prostitution herself.  However, her mother who wants her daughter back manages to rescue her before god knows what could have happened with her first inpatient and aggressive customer.
This movie should be an example of how everybody should make the right choices regarding their life.  I would really love to see this classic meaningful movie become officially available on DVD, which I would unquestionably buy.  I have not watched this for 20 years, and I really miss it.  Overall, my heart really went out to Tobi because of all the bad luck and trauma she suffered.",1512259200,,1825,4.692789968652038

7846493,5,6303425062,I remember watching this late night tv movie and it was great and entertaining storyline and plot. the stars were pretty good including loni Anderson and paul sorvino.  I never thought that I would see it again let alone be able to own it. I was able to get a gently used vhs tape from a former video store.great service take advantage if you are a movie buff searching for older films,1401062400,,385,4.347222222222222
7846494,5,6303425062,This was a new role for Loni Anderson. She did a great job playing this role without showing much at all. It was a good movie at a good price.,1361750400,,142,3.7666666666666666
7846495,5,6303425062,"Movie is well scripted and well acted. Loni Anderson plays an over the hill prostitute, whose life is changed when her daughter comes to live with her. Movie gives an indepth look about the seedy side of prostitution. Loni gives a better than average performance and so does Amanda Wyss as Loni's daughter. Nice views of San Francisco in movie and Loni proves she doesn't have to get out her Social Security card for income. Fully recommend to viewers. A+",1200960000,,455,4.7
