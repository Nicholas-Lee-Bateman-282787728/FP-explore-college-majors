2230602,3,B0007PIDB6,"My 2 year old daughter loves the old Mickey Mouse movies.  This one wasn't exactly the ""music"" edition we were looking for, but still an OKAY buy!",1236211200,,146,4.407407407407407
2230603,5,B0007PIDB6,"A friend has this, which impressed me.  I own the ""Starring Mickey"" DVD, and my 2 1/2 year old daughter is fascinated with the old cartoons.  They have a charm that rivets her unlike any of the current cartoons or Dora type of stuff.  I'm sure that part of the reason is that they are filled with slapstick comedy that isn't considered as ""correct"" for kids these days --- but wow, Disney sure did know what kids like!  The ""Starring Mickey"" DVD has a scene with Goofy and a piano, and its the first time I've heard my daughter laugh out loud at something she was watching by herself.  Fantastic hour long collections, with auto play, gotta love it!

And please, people writing about ""Treasures"" collections or what not -- these are inexpensive DVDs for average fans of Disney -- leave the pricey collections to real collectors, these DVDs are great for the rest of us!",1204761600,5,869,4.538461538461538
2230604,4,B0007PIDB6,"The fact that well-known Disney characters do not appear in many of these is a plus, not a drawback, in my mind.  If you want to expose your kids to good swinging jazz music, and classic animation, without character marketing, this is a great DVD to do it.  However, parents should note: Daisy Duck threatens suicide, actually putting a revolver to her head, in Donald's Dilemma.",1190505600,,379,4.7272727272727275
2230605,2,B0007PIDB6,"ALL of these cartoons have been released on DVD in Disney Treasures sets, so no reason to get this.

Orphan's Benefit (1934) - already on ""Mickey Mouse in B&W volume 1""

Farmyard Symphony (1938) - already on ""Silly Symphonies volume 1""

Mickey's Grand Opera (1936) - already on ""Mickey Mouse in Color volume 1""

How to Dance (1953) - already on ""The Complete Goofy""

Donald's Dilemma (1947) - to be released on ""Chronological Donald volume 3"" on December 11, 2007.

Music Land (1935) - already on ""Silly Symphonies volume 1""

Woodland Caf (1937) - already on ""Silly Symphonies volume 1""

2230606,3,B0007PIDB6,"As the other reviewer mentioned many of these shorts are on the various Disney Treasures collections so if you own those then you'll want to avoid this eight short feature collection.  The eight shorts on this hour-long DVD are all music themed and while they don't represent the best Disney shorts they are fairly decent.

""Mickey's Grand Opera"" is from 1936

""Music Land"" is a Silly Symphony from 1935 that doesn't feature any Disney Characters.

""Orphan's Benefit"" is from 1941 and has Mickey, Donald, and others putting on a show for orphan kids.

""Farmyard Symphony"" from 1938 is another Silly Symphony without benefit of Mickey or any of the other stable of characters.  It's a symphony set to the sounds of the barnyard animals...

""Pluto's Blue Note"" is from 1947 and probably the best short on this DVD.  Pluto finds he can use his tail as a phonograph.

""How to Dance"" In the 1950's, Disney made a series of ""how to"" shorts featuring goofy demonstrating various activities.  They were all pretty good.  This one from 1953 has Goofy showing off various dance syles.

""woodland Cafe""  One more Silly Symphony from 1937.

""Donald's Dilemma"" 1947 - After getting hit in the head with a flower pot, Donald thinks he's a famous crooner and no longer recognizes Daisy...until she clocks him with another pot.

The fact that three of the shorts are Silly Symphonies without Disney characters is going to really limit the appeal of this DVD to kids in my mind and since some of the other shorts can be found in the Treasures collections it won't have much appeal to Disney collectors either so I'm not so sure about this one.",1116547200,30,1626,4.736654804270462
2230607,1,B0007PIDB6,Many of these shorts on this DVD (as well as the other DVD's in this series) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these DVD's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you'll see on the cartoons!,1116374400,3,222,4.309523809523809

2230629,5,B0007PIDB6,They just don't make cartoons like this anymore and its a shame. My son loves watching Mickey and his friends in a variety of cartoons in lieu of Disney Junior's current Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. I wish Disney would return to programming like this!,1382313600,,246,4.744186046511628
2230630,5,B0007PIDB6,My little one just loves it. She watches it over and over again.. Soo great! I recommend this video to everyone.,1375660800,,112,4.380952380952381
2230631,4,B0007PIDB6,Can't get any better then Mickey. My grand daughter watches this every day...a must have for anyone that loves disney,1371427200,,117,4.9
2230632,5,B0007PIDB6,I ordered this because my husband and I want to have our children be able to watch the same great cartoons that we did! It arrived fast and exactly as described. We are very happy with our purchase!,1325203200,,198,4.2368421052631575
2230633,2,B0007PIDB6,"My 2 young boys love the classic Mickey Mouse & Friends shorts on the Sports Adventures DVD.  So I thought it would be fun to get one with music.

However, there isn't much Mickey Mouse or Friends on this DVD.  So my boys don't enjoy it.

I made the assumption based on the cover and the description that the shorts would be centered on the classic characters.  But most of them don't even have the classic characters in them.

Very disappointed.",1312329600,,446,4.444444444444445

2230635,1,B0007PIDB6,"This is not exactly what I expected.  My daughter loves the other classic Mickey movies, but this one was a disapointment.  Wouldn't buy again or recommend.",1298678400,,156,4.961538461538462
2230636,3,B0007PIDB6,"Everyone has already mentioned that these shorts are also on the treasure dvds but no one has mentioned that there is one on here that is also on another dvd from this series!!! Yes, ""how to dance"" is also on classic cartoon favorites starring goofy! I didn't think Disney would stoop so low as to duplicate shorts on the classic cartoon favorites line but they have. I now will check and see if any of the others are copied onto the other ones I have. Shame on you Disney!",1297209600,,473,4.325842696629214
2230637,5,B0007PIDB6,"Fun for the whole family to watch...over and over and over. You know what I mean if you have a young child. My daughter is two and loves to watch movies many more times than once. And she loves anything with Mickey Mouse. These cartoon classics are great. They keep her attention, but allow for her to go play and come back to watch a new one and still understand. It also plays on a loop...sits on the menu screen for a couple of minutes before restarting itself.",1293494400,,464,4.284090909090909
