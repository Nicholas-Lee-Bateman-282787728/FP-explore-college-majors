6031510,5,B00FURKOMM,"My wife and I purchased the DVD on 11-29-13 and watched it that night.  We both said ""this is beautiful"", it's beautiful on a number of levels.  At several points we were brought to tears.  The graphics are wonderful, the singing is beautiful and you did a great job of following scripture.

I'm 57 years old and my wife is 50.  We married September 7 of this year.  I proposed to her when the men of my bible study crashed her bible study this past May.  I had my bible study leader read to the group how during biblical times a Jewish man would betroth himself to his bride.  How he would declare the covenant he wishes to make with her, how he would pour wine and present the cup of his covenant to her and if she picked it up and drank from it she was saying yes to him, all these things I did and yes she picked up the cup and said she would join in covenant with me and be my wife.  When we saw this happening in your story it brought us to tears.

We will be encouraging friends to purchase your DVD and we will be sharing your story with many.

Thank you for your GREAT work, well done!!!

Grace and peace in Jesus,

Merry Christmas!",1385856000,25,1141,4.085585585585585
6031511,4,B00FURKOMM,"The Promise: Birth of the Messiah, The Animated Musical is exactly what it sounds like it is -- an animated musical.  Using the Biblical narrative of Jesus' birth from the book of St. Luke, this DVD presents a fresh look at the birth of Christ.  I was highly impressed with how much was included and how much it stayed true to the Biblical content.  This is one Christmas DVD where you won't find talking animals or such because the true story is so amazing that you really don't need anything that didn't really happen.

Something I really enjoyed about this DVD is the relationships.  I never thought of the reaction of Mary's parents.  While I had thought about Joseph's reaction before, I never considered how Mary's parents feelings to their daughter being chosen by God for such a special role in history.  Also, in the movie, Mary sings to Baby Jesus and calls him her King.  I never considered if she explained to Him who He was or if it was totally revealed by God to Him that He was to be the Messiah.

The one thing I did dislike about this DVD was I think if you weren't very familiar with the story it would be difficult to follow.  If you are showing it to children, I would read through the entire Biblical account first -- including Simeon, Elizabeth greeting Mary, as well as Luke chapter 2 which is commonly read at this time of year.  A friend said he felt like he had watched an opera about the birth of Christ.  Personally I wouldn't go that far, but these are not songs your children will sing constantly (which is a huge plus considering how annoying some songs are in children's DVDs.)

Overall, I think this is a very well done portrail of Christ's birth.  While is says it is for children, I think anyone would enjoy this because of the quality and how closely it follows Scripture.  It is a DVD I think families would enjoy year after year!

6031512,5,B00FURKOMM,"We received the movie today in the mail.  We truly enjoyed the film. Just the right of musical and speaking parts. It truly depicts the birth of Christ and that is hard to find in the day and age. Glorious Films did a tremendous job.
The Promise told the story of the birth right form the book of Luke as it happens in the book. It is biblically sound.
The music is spot on biblically. The Storyline is as well. The animation is like that of the major motion pictures. Very captivating. So excited that this video is now in our arsenal to watch over and over again. It did seem like it ended too soon however. I had to explain to my children, the video was just of the Birth.",1385683200,,675,4.152671755725191
6031513,4,B00FURKOMM,"I had the wonderful opportunity to preview (and now review) a new animated musical to be released to the public within the next few days on DVD. It's The Promise: Birth of the Messiah put out by Glorious Films.

Overall, I was struck with just how faithful they were to the Biblical texts regarding the coming and birth of Jesus.  I've noticed that sometimes in films that claim to tell Bible stories, it seems like movie makers' ploy seem to be to re-tell the story in a way that might not stay faithful to the Bible but may gain a big audience.  There is no hint of that going on in The Promise.  You can see throughout the film that the Bible was consulted and used faithfully and accurately in depicting one of the most wonderful stories of all time.  The director/writer is a preaching pastor himself and took the story pretty much directly out of Luke.  The Biblical consultants for the film are both seminary graduated pastors and I'm telling you, this story is the Bible coming to life without compromising any reverence to God's holy Word.

First off, I was impressed by the great animation. You definitely won't be wanting for more breathtaking scenery and almost balletic movement of the characters.  They used motion capture and 3D animation to bring the characters to the screen and it is quality stuff.  The animation in the opening scene of the temple is awe-inspiring.

Secondly, I was impressed with a few of the relationships portrayed on screen.  I loved the gentleness of Mary's father and thought it was a beautiful picture of a loving father/daughter relationship the way he did not doubt her when she told him she was to bear God's son; it also showed His great faith in God and this is something all fathers would aspire to!  I loved Elizabeth and Mary's relationship too.  Mary is encouraged by Elizabeth that nothing is impossible with God and that she will be blessed if she believes in the will of the Lord for her life.  And Mary and Joseph -- of course this would be a central relationship to the story.  I so enjoyed watching their love story interwoven into the big picture of the film.  Mary is a real-to-life character and so if Joseph.  They both are timid when they meet but you can tell they are quite taken with each other.  It was neat to watch their trust in God both separately and as a couple.

Third and lastly, I was amazed at the quality of the lovely music.  Most of the lyrics were straight out of the Bible and the melodies were immensely beautiful to listen to.  The stand out songs to me were Mary's Magnificat, the song that Zechariah sings when he gets his voice back (""His Name is John""), the angel Gabriel's proclamation to the shepherds along with the host of angels (""Glory to God in the Highest""), and of course, Mary's Lullabye at the end of the film.  These are songs I think my kids will be catching on to and singing for the Christmas season :)

I highly recommend this film for your whole family this holiday season and I can see this being a favorite Christmas movie tradition for my kids for years to come.",1385337600,22,3070,4.511754068716094
6031514,5,B00FURKOMM,So good!!! My kids watch this over and over.  The music is phenomenal and the quality of the animation is wonderful.  This is great!  I have learned a lot about the Nativity story and what was happening during the time of Jesus' birth from this movie. You will not retreat buying this.  I have purchased several copies as gifts because it is so good.,1485043200,,350,4.421875
6031515,5,B00FURKOMM,This movie was not as corny as I feared it might be. My kids love it and I find the songs to be very catchy and fun. The story is short while trying to capture the backstory so there's not as much focus on Jesus's actual birth but for me this helps bridge the gap since most Christmas books only really talk about the birth itself. This movie would be great to pair with a more detailed story of Jesus's birth and all of the people that came to honor him. Not many movies exist that tell this story so for having a small selection I'm very happy with how this story is told and the artfulness of the story telling and music numbers.,1484870400,,632,4.104838709677419
6031516,5,B00FURKOMM,"My very young children LOVE this film and dance and sing along! They would watch this several times a day if I allowed it! It is beautifully done, the songs are beautiful and it's young audience appropriate, and good chance for parents to talk about the message that comes with it!  Highly recommend!",1484524800,,300,4.660377358490566
6031517,5,B00FURKOMM,CHRISTMAS gift for grandchildren. Happily received a good family dvd. Focusing on the true meaning of Christmas at this season of the year.,1484179200,,139,5.086956521739131
6031518,1,B00FURKOMM,I I was very disappointed by this movie.  It wasn't very entertaining and did not hold the attention of my 4 Year old.  I found the story hard to follow because of the singing and it didn't follow the birth of Christ the way I would expect it to.  It was very dissappointing!,1483056000,,275,4.150943396226415
6031519,5,B00FURKOMM,I thought it was great! Biblical and not super cheesy like a lot of the other animated Nativity ones. So much easier to watch.,1482105600,,126,4.291666666666667
6031520,5,B00FURKOMM,must see,1481760000,,8,3.5
6031521,5,B00FURKOMM,Our whole family loves this movie! The songs are beautiful. The animation is very well done. The characterization is fantastic- and funny. It is true to the Bible but takes some liberties in developing the story such as Mary's mother's reaction etc. I only wish they had movies of other stories as well!,1481414400,,303,4.735849056603773
6031522,5,B00FURKOMM,"my 4 1/2 y.o. loves it and so do I. Now she understands about Jesus birth more and plays with her nativity set, telling THIS STORY!! It was great to see the faces of family as she told a lengthy story with her Nativity Set just unpacked after Thanksgiving! haha",1480204800,,261,4.24
6031523,4,B00FURKOMM,"This is a well done production.  The classical style music might appeal more to adults, but it seems to be produced for children.  I don't know---it seems like children prefer music with a faster beat.  I will let my friends with children view it and see what they think.  If the children don't stay focused on it, I will keep it for myself to play during the Christmas Season.",1474329600,,377,4.420289855072464

6031527,2,B00FURKOMM,"What a huge disappointment for us =( was sooooo excited when i ordered it. I'm giving 5 stars for the beautiful visual graphics,  the beautiful songs and singing, and biblical accuracy.  But it's just so boring and drawn out! My 3 year old son tried to like it but was also bored with all the singing. Bummer.",1461110400,,309,4.4035087719298245
6031528,4,B00FURKOMM,"Good story, neat approach to animating and story telling. My only issue is that some of the animated characters, like Joseph, are slightly odd looking in the face. Baby Jesus is very cute. My kids enjoy watching this story & DVD.",1458432000,,229,4.609756097560975
6031529,5,B00FURKOMM,This was such a beautiful movie and I wish it was a little longer. The family was very happy with it when we watched it on Christmas Day. I highly recommend it.,1454976000,,160,4.03125

6031534,5,B00FURKOMM,A fresh and high quality re-telling of the Christmas story,1453939200,,58,4.9
6031535,5,B00FURKOMM,Very biblically based. My kids loved it but I probably loved it more. Very moving.,1453507200,,82,4.533333333333333
6031536,5,B00FURKOMM,"EXCELLENT!  Very high quality musical!  Musical scores and songs are extremely well done.  Our 19 month old really enjoyed watching this over the 12 hour car trip visiting family for Christmas.  This DVD is requested over and over again by our little one.  We enjoy it too!  I keep checking their website to see when the next one comes out!  I hope they keep making more of these.  Approximately 45 minutes, just FYI.",1453248000,,417,4.616438356164384
6031537,4,B00FURKOMM,"Love a lot of things about this movie.  Lots of biblical quoting word for word.  Nice animation.  Pretty actuate story.  Probably the most actuate one I have ever seen.  The small issues I have are that Mary's mother is pretty dishonoring to her husband and Mary.  She is harsh and aggressive and unpleasant.  While this may have been the case we don't know it to be true biblically.  I actually fast forwarded through those 2 minute parts that happen twice. Also they make Mary's dad a potter. Since we teach our kids that Luke was a doctor, Joseph a carpenter, etc. I don't want them to assume that Mary's father was a potter as biblical truth.  Why not just leave it out as it doesn't add to the story.  Also I get the singing but it would be nice if there was more regular talking and the songs were the highlights like Disney does it.  Sometimes the younger ones get lost in the songs and can't follow the story as well.  Overall it is a keeper but I will continue to edit out Mary's mother.",1453075200,13,996,4.324324324324325
6031538,5,B00FURKOMM,"In the words of my son, ""I'm going to watch this a hundred million times"".  Very cute perspective on the Nativity.  I loved the songs and so do the kids",1452902400,,152,4.033333333333333
6031539,5,B00FURKOMM,"My 2 1/2 year old son is on the autism spectrum. He has been obsessed with mickey mouse clubhouse ever since birth, but ever since my sister got my son this DVD for Christmas it has been on repeat. I'm so glad he is finally interested in something else, especially something that teaches my son about Jesus. Even though I have to listen and watch it 20 times a day, I don't mind too much because it makes my son very happy (: the story is well-executed and the songs are catchy",1452556800,,477,4.195652173913044
6031540,4,B00FURKOMM,"Overall, I absolutely choose this over something that portrays Baby Jesus as a sweet, bouncing cucumber.

Positive:
-very closely follows the biblical account
-gives beautiful scenery and plausible depictions of landscape, temple, etc
-uses songs

Negative:
-some of the characters (angels) are really awkward in their movement
-loooong songs and slow plot movement",1449878400,,365,5.867924528301887
6031541,5,B00FURKOMM,Great movie! My children AND husband loved and and hope they pursue more projects!,1449532800,,82,4.928571428571429
6031542,5,B00FURKOMM,"I purchased this for my daughters. They have not seen it yet because it is a gift for Christmas. I previewed it because I wanted to make sure it followed the Biblical story and was something I would want them to see. I loved all of the details it included and all of the Scripture that was quoted in word and in song.

 I unlike some other reviewers did not have a problem with the wise men  not being a part of this as they did not come along till possibly years later. A sequel including that part of the story would be great though.

I would love to see more films from this company.",1449100800,3,586,4.069565217391304
6031543,5,B00FURKOMM,"A beautiful portrayal of the very first Christmas. My 1 year old and 3 year old talk about it and ask to watch it often. Definitely a musical, a new song every few minutes. More of a classical, operatic style, but very beautiful. Only wish the wise men had been included. I would recommend!",1448841600,3,290,4.388888888888889
6031544,5,B00FURKOMM,"This is by far our favorite Christmas animated movie for younger children. Our girls (ages 4 and 6) love it. It's well done, has great music, some humor and a great story line. Wish they had more films. Thinking about buying some for gifts. Would totally buy again.",1448668800,,265,4.541666666666667
6031545,5,B00FURKOMM,A wonderful presentation of the Nativity.  I loved the cartoons especially Joseph's face.  The simplicity of the story was profound.  I liked the way the artist presented the Angels in Heaven but they did not include the three wise men.  I think they were forced into a 45 minute movie length so putting the 3 Kings in the story would have made it longer.  Here is wishing the same producers would make a 3 Kings story and the Nativity.  I plan on showing my religion students this movie for their Christmas viewing.  A great buy!,1448496000,3,530,4.515789473684211
6031546,5,B00FURKOMM,I only wish they had more of these... I will continue to support them.,1437696000,5,70,4.071428571428571
6031547,5,B00FURKOMM,"Great movie. Somewhat of a musical but my toddler had a million questions, I recommend this movie for children 9yrs and above. That's the age they really understand the world and explaining can be easier.",1433548800,,204,4.857142857142857
6031548,4,B00FURKOMM,It's a good movie but didn't keeps daughters attention too much and she loves cartoons so I was a little  shocked hahaha,1433203200,,120,4.454545454545454
6031549,5,B00FURKOMM,"Our entire family loved this movie!  Mom, dad and all the children (ages range from 1 to 11) really loved this.

I really love the treatment of the betrothal of Joseph and Mary, Mary's singing of the Magnificat, the portrayal of the angels and the way Joseph is given understanding that Mary is telling the truth.  The animation is wonderfully done, the shepherds are portrayed very realistically, and the infant Jesus is portrayed as endearingly real.  I would give it ten stars, if it were possible.",1420588800,2,447,4.855263157894737
6031561,2,B00FURKOMM,Bought this to show to our Sunday School kids ages 5 to 12.  They became bored and uninterested.  Adults were mixed.  Some liked it others did not.  They thought it was too Disney-like.,1419638400,,185,4.515151515151516
6031562,1,B00FURKOMM,Not a fan of the CGI.  Animations are too smooth and unnatural. The entire video is singing. Not like other musicals where there is dialogue and singing this one is straight singing. Songs are boring and unimaginative and several parts felt off key and rushed. Not a good movie for small children as it won't hold their attention and older children will get bored quickly with the lack of dialogue. Overall it did hold to the biblical story but that's really all it has going for it.,1419465600,,483,4.551724137931035
6031563,3,B00FURKOMM,I used for our Sunday School classes.  Too much singing to hold attention of children 12 and under.  Maybe bettter for an older audience.  Disappointed.,1419379200,,152,5.0

6031570,5,B00FURKOMM,What a charming telling of the nativity story.  Very faithful to the Bible in it's lyrics and actions.

6031574,3,B00FURKOMM,"This movie was good.  Though I suppose I was expecting more.  In this current time when animation is as good as most live action films, I forgot that many are still made for kids.  Not that this was ""kiddie fare"", but it was leaning that way.
It was pretty short, and glossed over much of the story.  Also, though much of the music is very good, some of the songs are not as good as the others and are not particularly memorable. Again, good movie, if not great.",1396310400,,462,4.215909090909091
6031575,5,B00FURKOMM,"Hi
I am Korean and I am not very good at English.
My 4-year-old daughter doesn't understand English but she likes this story very much. She saw this movie several times and one day she asked me (in Korean), ""what does that mean ""Nothing is impossible with God""?
I am so thankful this DVD is helpful not only for my daughter's faith but also for her learning English.
It is a wonderful story with beautiful music.
I myself like it.
I would like to recommend you to give this DVD to your friends who have kids or those who need to know Jesus as a present.

6031576,5,B00FURKOMM,Great Christian movie. Followes the Bible closely. Music is uplifting and appropriate for the movie. Easy to follow even for someone not familiar with the story.,1391385600,,161,5.230769230769231
6031577,4,B00FURKOMM,"I will disagree with some of the other reviewers and point out that this beautifully-made animated musical does take liberties with the story of the birth of Christ.  It takes license with the character of Mary's mother, Anna and introduces Mary's father who was never mentioned in the bible. Also, the producers decided to portray Mary as a young woman and not a young teenager. There are some other smaller liberties but they are negligible. The songs are beautiful and well-sung.  Overall, it is a good Christmas movie of faith fit for the family.",1390176000,2,550,4.840425531914893
6031578,5,B00FURKOMM,Our 3 and 4 year old girls love this and even our 1 year old dances to the music.  It's a great message and well done movie.,1389744000,,124,3.5925925925925926
6031579,5,B00FURKOMM,"Excellent drama with music of the Birth Narrative of Jesus. Your kids will love it too.

This is the Birth of the Messiah...and caution: if you are expecting more...like the life of Jesus as a boy or even the flight to and from Egypt, then you will feel that it ends abruptly, but it is outstanding till then.
Music is great.  The production value of animation is excellent (even if figures are all elongated).  The singing is marvelous. The Scriptural integrity is good.

I have one pet peeve of most nativity depictions: Jesus was born in a house, not a stable or a cave.  Likely the house of his relative (the reason for Joseph going back to his family home).  And if this seems a bizarre notion to some, it is not some liberal non-sense but simply a correction of one poorly translated Greek word.  The word translated ""Inn"" is better translated as guest room or even guest lodging.  So, what was full that night was the guest room of his family's home, so Jesus was born in the main living room (or a two room home) where, at night, any family livestock were also brought in-doors.  so one could hope that such a new production would show Jesus being born in a house of one of the relatives... something almost all scholars agree on now (and was first posited way back in the 1890's by Greek scholar Plummer and now many current translations follow). But old traditions die slowly, I understand.

So, this is pure joy to view. It is also Granddaughter approved.  :)

Enjoy this new Christmas Classic. Oh, my wife (from Texas) says this is the music from a performance done yearly done there someplace.  Can't recall where.",1389657600,3,1627,4.549828178694158
6031580,2,B00FURKOMM,Yjis was well done in many ways.  I was expecting something other than an Opera style.  It doesn't hold the attention of the  children.  OK for adults.  Animation is well done.,1389571200,,176,4.548387096774194
6031581,5,B00FURKOMM,Closely follows the biblical text. Beautifully detailed animation and enjoyable music that you will find yourself singing along to right away. This film is the best if both worlds. A great animated Christmas movie that is theologically sound. You can't go wrong purchasing this film for yourself as well as for all your loved ones.,1389052800,,331,5.036363636363636
6031582,5,B00FURKOMM,"Purchased this once, watched it, loved it and then made two more purchases as gifts. Shipped quickly and loved that I had something meaningful to give to some children that are special to me....and that they received the truth in a tangible way! Loved it!",1388620800,,255,4.688888888888889
6031583,5,B00FURKOMM,This movie is fantastic!  It is done with much quality and care.  My children ages 5 & 7 really enjoyed it.  The characters are realistic and relatable.  There are even parts of the movie that made us laugh.  This movie has now become part of our Christmas tradition.  I would highly recommend to every family serious about teaching their children the bible.  I really cannot say enough great things about this movie!,1386806400,6,417,4.708333333333333
6031584,4,B00FURKOMM,"Good movie. More ""musical"" than I expected or wanted, but still a good message and quite true to the Biblical narrative.",1386720000,,120,4.761904761904762
6031585,5,B00FURKOMM,"My 9 year old son loved the movie and I did too.  I wish they had fast forwarded time when Jesus was a toddler when the kings come to visit.  I think it was lacking slightly because the movie stopped after the shepherds came to visit and no kings arrived to worship the King of kings.  I STILL LOVED IT BUT JUST WISH IT HAD CONTINUED A LITTLE LONGER.

If you like this one, you'll love this DVD:  The Miracle Maker:  The Story of Jesus, Special Edition",1386633600,3,452,4.137931034482759
6031586,3,B00FURKOMM,"My daughter loved the music as well as the animation and was able for the most part to sit through the 45 minute film.  I also loved the beautiful animation and songs, but at times felt rushed through parts.  This is a great movie for those who are already familiar with the Biblical telling of the Birth of Jesus, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for someone who isn't aware as I think it might be very confusing as to what exactly is going on from scene to scene.

Overall, we will happily watch this during the Christmas season as a way to connect to the true meaning of the holiday and I would recommend it to other Christian households to add to their collection.",1386288000,,677,4.4
6031587,4,B00FURKOMM,"The Promise: The Birth of the Messiah is an animated musical celebration of one of the most pivotal events in all human history, the birth of Jesus Christ. This beautifully crafted musical is a faithful adaptation of the birth narrative from the Gospel of Luke in both story and song. The animated production leverages optical motion technology to blend traditional animation techniques with the performance talents of ballet dancers and dramatic stage actors. The result is a unique and a worshipful story experience that will inspire audiences young and old for years to come. - Says Glorious Films

I have had the great privilege in the ability to review this movie with my 4 year old daughter. Last Monday afternoon we snuggled up next to the Christmas tree and was reminded of what Christmas is all about with wonderful musical numbers, terrific animation and a story that provided biblical truths in a way that a child can understand. We laughed so hard when Zechariah was mumbling to Elizabeth for he had lost his ability to talk when he was in misbelief to the news Gabriel came to tell him in the tabernacle. Elizabeth said to him, ""What's the matter, Angel got your tongue."" I was excited to hear my daughter exclamations at the birth of John, ""he is supposed to be in a box mommy!"" I let her know that Jesus will be born soon. She knew exactly what was happening!

What an incredible gift for your family this year is to share them the musical that changed the world. You can purchase this DVD on amazon.com or you can enter to win it! I have a giveaway. -  Twin Falls Motherhood Examiner",1386288000,2,1599,4.6431095406360425
6031588,5,B00FURKOMM,"While I wanted to watch and review The Promise: Birth of the Messiah, I have to admit that this was one of the rare occasions I agreed to review something when I wasn't almost 100% sure that my family and I would love it. The trailer intrigued us, but I thought there was a 50/50 chance we would love the movie based on the trailer. I honestly think thats because the snippets presented in the trailer are taken out of context. You definitely cant make a decision on the movie from that trailer.

I agreed to do the review because I love the Christmas story and know that many parts of it were sung, but we rarely hear them that way. We always hear them read straight from the text in the Gospels.

When we received the DVD and sat down to watch it, my concerns about not liking the movie were erased. We were completely absorbed from the first scene.

The Promise: Birth of the Messiah was much more than just a musical retelling of the Christmas story. The music was beautiful and well-timed, and this musical reminded me of something very important I tend to forget: the people involved in the greatest Story ever told were just ordinary people, like me. The Promise brought that alive for me. Joseph and  Marys betrothal was so tender it made me cry. Josephs burden of caring for Mary, who is obviously about to give birth, weighed heavy on him. Zechariah and Elizabeths easy relationship from long years of marriage, just the two of them, was both touching and amusing. The shepherds invitation to the manger and their faithful response was beautiful. And a scene near the end, between Mary and the infant Jesus, helped me to realize what it must have been like to raise the Messiah, the Savior of the world, while knowing He is the Son of God.

We also enjoyed seeing the Bibles descriptions of the Temple come to life. We have been reading through the Bible as a family this year, and we have read descriptions of the Temple over and over again. To see the scale of some of the items we have read about (like the bronze Sea) depicted made the Word come to life for us.

The DVD is 45 minutes long, and when it was over, my ten-year-old said, Aw, man! Thats it? My eight-year-olds response was I want them to make another one.

When Glorious Films comes out with another movie, well be one of the first families in line to see what they have done!

6031589,5,B00FURKOMM,"I watched this DVD at a friend's house, and just ordered copies for myself and my grandchildren. This was so well done with beautiful scenes and the music was exquisite. This will be a wonderful way to share the true meaning of Christmas in my home.",1386201600,,249,4.434782608695652
6031590,4,B00FURKOMM,"I've been on the lookout for Christmas traditions that incorporate the birth of Christ so that each year we can celebrate the true meaning of Christmas and this DVD is truly what I have been looking for! ""The Promise: Birth Of The Messiah"" is a beautiful animated musical from Glorious Films. This is a movie you have to see for yourself to understand just how beautiful it is.

My personal favorite part of the movie was just how much of the dialog and lyrics came straight out of scripture. I also loved the 3-D animation especially the scenery. Add in the beautiful music and incredibly accurate storytelling, and I'm just completely blown away by how amazing this movie truly is. My only disappointment with the movie was that there was no closed captioning. Although I knew it was a long shot because it is a small production company, I use closed captioning every day and I hope one day, every DVD comes with it!",1386201600,,918,4.597560975609756
6031591,5,B00FURKOMM,"The Promise Birth of the Messiah from Glorious Films is one of the best Christmas animated DVDs I have ever seen. What is even better is this movie is a musical and very, very well done. The whole DVD  tells the story from when Joseph and Mary met, get engaged and up until Jesus is born and they see Simeon in the Temple.
  The Promise is a very uplifting, precious story and it tells the birth story of Jesus as it actually happened in the Bible.
  The scenes and costumes are very realistic. Clara Scott and Michael Daniel Murphy do a great job as Mary and Joseph. Their singing voices are so superb. This DVD The Promise is for the whole family, from your youngest to your oldest family members. It can and will be enjoyed by all.
 I highly recommend this DVD The Promise-Birth of the Messiah. A new Christmas movie to become a classic.

6031592,5,B00FURKOMM,"It wouldn't be the Christmas season without a great reason to celebrate Jesus' birth! Thanks to the folks from Glorious Films they have fulfilled that calling in a great way with the launch of the DVD, The Promise: Birth of the Messiah. An animated musical for children and families running about 45 minutes long, the animation is amazing! It follows the biblical account from the Bible from the book of Luke that tells of the special way God chose Mary and Joseph to become the birth parents of Jesus Christ. Like your typical musicals this one is filled with beautiful details that outline the angelic proclamation from the angel Gabriel coming to Mary and telling her that she was chosen to give birth as a virgin to the future Savior of the World.

The animated production leverages optical motion technology to blend traditional animation techniques with the performance talents of ballet dancers and dramatic stage actors. The result is a unique and worshipful story experience that will inspire audiences young and old for years to come. This would make a great Christmas gift or stocking stuffer this year as a way to inspire a new tradition in your family to watch together.
