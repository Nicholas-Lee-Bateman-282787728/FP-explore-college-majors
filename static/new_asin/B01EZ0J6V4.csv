8759844,4,B01EZ0J6V4,Great movie,1526860800,,11,5.0
8759845,5,B01EZ0J6V4,"An excellent film, and the scene where Lauren Bacall has a heart attack, early on , is not to be missed. Can she act!!!

Be aware of  bad Vault Collectible transfers. The Fox Movie channel of old had a CinemaScope copy..why didn't Fox use this for this very dramatic film, once it gets going.",1495497600,2,292,4.388888888888889

8759848,1,B01EZ0J6V4,"Buyer beware - This is a PAN AND SCAN transfer, and a very bad one at that. Fox apparently dug through its vaults to find the poorest dupe
print. The print that is shown on the Fox Movie Channel is a scope transfer with very nice color. This DVD, however, is shameful and a dastardly rip-off!!! UNWATCHABLE. Just saw the movie on TCM - it was Letterboxed!!!!!!!!!",1462924800,20,363,4.432835820895522
