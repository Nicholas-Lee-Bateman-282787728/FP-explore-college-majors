7801687,5,1933233141,Very good show and does a good job of showing what happened behind the scenes of this event. I lived through it but only through news reports. Had no idea of what the students were actually going through until I saw this movie.,1421452800,,227,4.3023255813953485
7801688,5,1933233141,"This 19-minute short documentary film won Best Documentary Short Subject - 1964 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  The film is narrated by Jefferson Thomas, himself, one of the Little Rock Nine.  The incident occurred in 1957; this film is an important documentary showing whereabouts of Little Rock Nine around 1964 when most of which just graduated colleges and started their new careers.  Except one who married and became a housewife (her picture is shown without her voice or video), all the others themselves showed up in this film, commenting the incident in 1957 as well as their current status and future dream at the time of filming.  The sound is clear and the DVD has closed caption.  The following is the last words in the film by Jefferson Thomas:

I haven't counted all the victories since that first day when we went to school here.  But, I know theres, at least, nine.  Little Rock thought that problems can make us better, much better.",1417996800,,964,4.8
7801689,5,1933233141,"Here is the documentation of a city that was led by a good governor that had his heart in the right place until Central High School was ordered to be integrated. The good governor lost his right mind and gave in to the KKK and other racists to guarantee his job in the governor's mansion for a long time. He forgot American history and the fact that nobody confronts the United States of America and wins! He wanted to fight the Civil War again, and he lost as did the other governors of Southern states in a few years to come. This is a story of justice, equality, love, brotherhood and sisterhood, and the people and students that helped change America. Today the far right, Ted Cruz, Governor Rick Perry, and the Tea Party",1393632000,,725,4.417910447761194
7801690,1,1933233141,"This poorly done, overpriced 19 minute movie fails to honor the magnificent teens who went into Hell to change a defiant society.  The music is lousy and inappropriate, just short of elevator music, so no stir of emotions there.  The acting is wooden the script lame and the story weak.  How on earth could you make a staggeringly heroic event seem tedious?  Well, they did in this dvd.  I want my money back!",1299715200,16,409,4.5479452054794525
