3 stars is generous, 2.5 might be more accurate. Fred Ward and Robert Patrick are good actors, but the cliched dialogue and pedestrian storyline don't give them much to work with. Both supporting actresses bare their breasts, and there's enough action to sustain interest, but there's not enough depth to enthrall. However, the scenery is attractive in some shots, as it appears to have been filmed on location somewhere in Central America. There are many better films in this genre, but you might be marginally entertained by this film if your expectations aren't high.",1079136000,4,614,5.079207920792079
7894365,5,6305787212,"Robert Patrick (X-Files) has made his way to a top television program thanks to his hard work.  Chris Carter is good at spotting talent and Patrick is proving to be another hit.  But movies like ""Forgotten City"" were stepping stones on the way.  Patrick lends his easy-going manner to this movie making him a credible character.  Fred Ward's staple masculine character (Tremors) is perfect as the rich guy on a quest. Together they keep ""City"" going.  Though not as full of action as top adventure stories can be, these two actors are worth watching.  If you like Robert Patrick or Fred Ward you will want to see this.",1005782400,3,618,4.675925925925926
7894366,2,6305787212,"This movie is just like every other action flick, but on a smaller budget. Violence, explosions, car chases, explosions and uh... explosions don't make a movie great. Robert Patrick is in it and he is actually quite good with the script he has to work with. I can hear him right now yelling, ""I need a better agent"". This movie is not very good but I've seen way worse.",976406400,3,369,4.36231884057971
