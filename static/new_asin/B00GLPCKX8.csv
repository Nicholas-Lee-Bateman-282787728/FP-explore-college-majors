6081095,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This is about family allegiances and rivalry. What makes the film fly off the screen are the performances of the superb cast. As Tom Hiddleston (Loki) states, ""Your job as an actor is to find a way of being truthful in those particular circumstances. After that it is simple"" (NYT 11/10/13, Arts & Leisure:18-19). Hiddleston graduated from Cambridge with honors in Greek and Latin; he and the rest of the ""Thor"" ensemble bring sharp intelligence to their roles, carrying the genre to another level.

Iceland's starkly beautiful landscape, with its mountains and waterfalls,  creates an even more authentic Viking landscape. There are also great historic locals in the U.K. incorporated into this feast for the eyes. Does the film accomplish what it sets out to? Yes!

Under the protection of S.H.E.I.L.D., she has been lonely and lost. Now, a year later, Thor is Crown Prince of Asgard. He finds an angry Jane and transports her to Asgard. But is his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) happy about this? NO! Meanwhile, scientist Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd, one of the best), Jane's colleague and mentor, isn't doing too well. In the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B0034G4P80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>, he scoffed at Thor's claim that the old stories Erik grew up with are actually true...

Thankfully, there is a lot more plot involving Heimdall (Idris Elba), the Asgardian sentry of the Bifrst Bridge (in Norse mythology this means ""burning rainbow""). The Bifrst Bridge connects the Nine Realms, one of which is earth, or Midgard. And there is more of Frigga (Rene Russo), Queen of Asgard, as she attempts to understand and guide her stepson Loki. Having been beaten and bashed by The Hulk in ""The Avengers,"" Loki is now pushed into an alliance with his brother Thor, as they are forced to battle a common enemy together.

In conflict with Odin, Thor must fight to save the Nine Realms from Malekith the Accursed (Christopher Eccleston, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000E41MS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>, the ruler of the Dark Elves of another of the Nine Realms, Svartalfheim. In revenge for the loss of his family, Malekith the Accursed works with his trusted lieutenant, Algrim the Strong (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Algrim is transformed into a powerful creature called Kurse. They seek to plunge the whole of the universe into darkness.

6081107,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I bought this and watched it when it first came out... but I must have been distracted while watching it the first time because I didn't go back to it until I was watching some of the newer Avengers movies.  I was confused about some of the story line and decided to go back and buy all the Marvel movies and start watching them in order.  I was told that I didn't remember this movie because it was so bad.... but after watching it (I think for the 2nd time) I really liked it!  I love the humor that is put in on occasion to help offset the seriousness of the storyline.  There were some parts that I felt were a little over the top, even for Marvel, but I think the movie was really well done.

Pro tip: don't watch the Thor movies out of order or some of the important parts of the storyline will not make sense!  ;)  Oh... and bonus features on all these movies are totally worth watching!!!",1530057600,,896,4.144508670520231

6081109,1,B00GLPCKX8,"This is a great looking film, but if you remove all of the CGI, you are left with yet another disposable one dimensional bad guy, poorly written dialogue, humor that falls flat, and no character arc (decent acting though).  Seriously, by the end of the film nothing has changed except for the fact that a single disposable character has died - to which nobody has a believable/convincing reaction.  Maybe if I was a marvel or Thor fanbody I would have been blind to all of the above and enjoyed some aspect of this film, but alas I saw this for what it was, another piece of hot garbage churned out simply to make money.

6081166,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Nine screenwriters assemble the dissociate jumbled element of this second installment in the THOR series (the first being directed by Kenneth Branagh and this one directed by Alan Taylor) and despite the presence of  a very similar cast this version depends more on spectacular CGI effects than on acting. It is a movie for lovers of comic book tales and it just bounces between firestorm and dissolution of nine realms to London and back.

The plot? This synopsis makes a little sense of it:  Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown. The other good folks on Asgard are portrayed by Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stephenson, Tadanobu Asano, and the folk down on earth are Stellan Skarsgrd, Kat Dennings, Jonathan Howard, and Chris ODowd. Oh and there is a cast a thousands of Asgardians and Dark Elves to tear up the screen. The real star is the team of CGI artists.

Now, that said, it is a comic, and Hollywood, so believability and just common sense does not need to apply. Guess what, Marvel?

6081293,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Of all the films in the MCU, this is definitely one of the weaker installments, which I hate to say, because the film brings a bunch of ideas into the mix. The problem is the execution. Thor reunites with Natalie Portman and her scientist friends who witness random spatial displacements on Earth. Natalie Portman then gets possessed by the 'Aether', some legendary substance and the most forgettable Marvel villains, the Dark Elves try to overthrow Asgard.

Tom Hiddleston returns in this film as the cunning Loki, which I'm thankful for, because he's easily the most popular Marvel villain. However, the story seems to go all over the place in terms of pacing and focus. And at the end of the day, you know there aren't going to be any lasting stakes because they need to produce more sequels at the end of the day.

It's disappointing that the Thor films aren't quite to the standard of some of the other Marvel films, because he's practically a god. And yet the majority of this film is bogged down in a forced love story between Thor and Natalie Portman which is reminiscent of Attack of the Clones.

The worst thing about this film is that it introduces one of the Infinity Stones, yet the way they handle it is so clumsy. You only find out what it is in the mid-credits sequence, for God's sake.

Kat Dennings was quite unbearable in this film also. The awkward humour that comes from her character is cringeworthy at the highest degree. I know that Marvel films like to mix up the drama with a bit of lighthearted humour, but it really seems that in this case, the writers had all the drama established in the script and then at the eleventh hour, they realized ""Damn it! There's nothing funny here! Quick, let's make yer wan from 2 Broke Girls be the only source of comic relief!"" To conclude, this film tries to be epic, and while there are interesting ideas and concepts here, it ultimately falls flat.

6081312,2,B00GLPCKX8,"I genuinly enjoy everything Marvel has been putting out for since 2008. Their universe is one of the few series to have a completely functioning line of amazing actors and directors to make this happen. As a result, I've decided to make a blu-ray and digital collection of all movies and television series. I've been purchasing all movies new on Amazon to ensure the digital codes are intact. When I received my copy of Blu-ray, Dvd, and digital HD from Amazon of Thor: The Dark World, it was in its shrink wrap as all other purchases I have made. However, the digital code had somehow alreadly been used in this copy. Now that it was out of the shrink wrap and contained to valid digital code, my purchase was now useless to what I had spent my money on. I'm dissapointed in the fact that if I want a digital copy, I now have to spend an additional $20 on top of the $25 I had already spent to get what I was looking for.",1498521600,,922,4.274285714285714

Seriously, for a huge chunk of the movie she does absolutely nothing. Thor must protect her from a colorless villain (literally and figuratively) who wants to steal the Aether for himself. The film does pick up a bit in the middle with an attack on Asgard which forces Thor to team up with Loki. By the time of the final (Loki-less) battle for the Universe, I had checked out of the movie. But let's get back to Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth. These two have chemistry off the charts. I genuinely would be interested in seeing what these two actors could do in a completely different film together.",1481414400,,719,4.76
6081425,5,B00GLPCKX8,Great movie.,1481414400,,12,5.5
6081426,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Released in 2013 and directed by Alan Taylor, Thor: The Dark World stars Chris Hemsworth in his second solo movie as the Thunder God. Natalie Portman returns as an astrophysicist and Thors earth babe, Jane Porter, whos infected by an eerie otherworldly substance called aether. After Thor brings Jane to Asgard, war breaks out when the dark elf, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), comes for the powerful substance.

The Thor comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms: the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories. Like the first movie, this sequel is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).

The bulk of the movie takes place on Asgard and the sci-fi effects are just mind-blowing; I particularly like Malekiths spacecrafts and the Asgardian ship-crafts. Thankfully, there are some Earth sequences, including the dynamic climax in London. Bottom Line: This is a thrilling sequel; if you like the first movie youll appreciate this one too.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Hopkins appears as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Ray Stevenson as Volstaag, Tadanobu Asano as Hogan, Kat Dennings as Darcy and Stellan Skarsgrd as Eric.

The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in England and Iceland, with additional studio work done in Manhattan Beach, California.

6081431,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I think this is better than the first episode because the story is more logical and built a more complex character. Loki wants to take charge of Asgard, but Loki is the great villain who has invaded earth with his army.
Thor had to cooperate with Loki because the Malekith threatened their world, and Loki knew him and his kind. Two brothers became alliance now and they will fight for the same thingto protect the Asgard, but does Loki really became the good one? Nope!
There are several questions I have not understood clearly. Odin died or not, that is a mystery, why Loki can pretend as Odin, does Thor figure it out? I have not found out and the third piece is coming soon.",1480896000,,678,4.432

I thought the violence was too intense and relentless (even for a superhero movie).  So while my 8 year old saw other superhero movies like spiderman and Guardians of the Galaxy we left this one off limits for the younger kids in the house and let the teens watch it after bed.

Also I have to say Thor is my least favorite marvel superhero.  If you like Thor you will like this movie, but if you prefer other superhero's watch those first.  But of the two Thor movies my teens had me watch I like this one less than the other one.",1477699200,,649,4.193548387096774

6081473,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I rented The Dark World specifically to see Doctor Who Christopher Eccleston as the villain Malekith.  In a film full of exaggerated and prolonged fx battle sequences, Christopher Eccleston's performances are solid and make this film a must-see.  Thor himself is performed well and I like the relationships in the films.  Loki is even more fun this time around as we never quite know what he will do next.

The plot's okay, the one-liners are copious and quite entertaining, the stunt work by the actors and stunt crew alike is fabulous, and I greatly enjoyed the CGI effects as well.

6081572,4,B00GLPCKX8,Who doesn't love Thor?  I enjoyed this movie without a doubt.  I think the first one was better but that's to be expected.  It's pretty typical that the sequel is never as good as the first movie but outside of that I have to say it was good.  I've always loved super hero movies (with the exception of a few) and this one is not one of those exceptions.,1467763200,,354,4.086956521739131
6081573,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel Studios appears to have another bona fide hit on their hands in the seventh-feature film of its superhero franchise, and the second of Phase 2, in THOR: THE DARK WORLD.

Sequels are a delicate proposition with the inevitable comparisons to the films that have come before. Fans continue to look for the next Godfather 2 or The Empire Strikes Back, and hope they don't receive another Ghostbusters 2. Expectations (especially in this era of social media) can crush a film before it is even released - Im looking at you Star Wars Episode VII.

All that being noted, Thor: The Dark World is another fine chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Marvel-newcomer Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones), the story continues the emotional journey of the would-be Asgardian king as Thor continues to be torn between two worlds and family obligations. Chris Hemsworth once again brings the right mixture of seriousness, fun and larger-than-life persona that Thor is - not an easy trick to pull off. I would challenge this role may be even more difficult than playing the Man of Steel.

The Dark World opens catching the audience up with post-Avengers consequences for Loki (Tom Hiddleston by the way is once again delightful as the Prince of Lies and Marvel should really consider giving him a solo go at it because he is that good), while also setting up the story of the dark elves and their leader, Malekith (with a strong performance by Christopher Eccleston).

Besides our returning-Asgardian cast of Odin, Heimdall, Sif and The Warriors Three (although sadly they had less to do this time around), we also catch up with Jane Foster, Eric Selvig and Darcy. Avoiding all the traps of a sequel, we find our trio in new roles this time around. The best of the three is the madness in which envelopes Selvig after having a God in his head. Its nice to see some real consequences to the characters from the events of the previous films, however viewers jumping in for the first time would definitely not be lost.

Speaking of consequences, there are some oh no they didn't moments with characters that audience members won't see coming, especially a terrific sequence with Thor, Loki and Malekith.

Fans of Walt Simonsons seminal run on The Mighty Thor will not be disappointed, and there are quite a few easter egg moments, including an all-too brief cameo appearance by Thors first antagonist from the pages of Journey Into Mystery #103. The post title scene does not disappoint and sets up Guardians of the Galaxy as well as potentially Avengers 3.

Most of the action takes place on Asgard and other worlds of the nine realms, with the movies climax coming on Earth, which once again takes center stage. However, the heart of Thor: The Dark World is Thors split loyalties and the ultimate decision he needs to make, and just wait until the movies final scene on Asgard - cue Thor 3. Thor: The Dark World should not disappoint.",1467676800,15,2932,4.782608695652174

Chris Helmsworth is great in title role, but Tom Hiddlestons tortured sensitive, yet scheming and cold Loki is my fav villain since the great Alan Rickman.  He steals every scene.  Great job by all the cast, great story and effects.  Awesome chemistry between Loki and Thor..excellent casting choices.  Hope to see Loki many more times....you just cant take your eyes off him when he is on screen,  This role for him will go down as a classic...he captures the catlike strut, yet vulnerability of one who deep down just wanted equal time to Thors.

6081588,4,B00GLPCKX8,"A vast improvement on the previous Thor movie which featured its most climatic battle (with the ice giants) around the first half of the film. This film has great interactions between Thor and Loki. The clip with Captain America/Loki was hilarious. The villains are shown to be ancient, highly lethal, and intelligent -- worthy opponents to challenge the strengths of both Loki and Thor. Jane's interaction with Thor is well done and not maddeningly dragged out. Slapping him for not visiting when he was in New York to help the Avengers, yet as in love with him as ever. It was great to see some of Thor's generation stepping up to keep the peace in his realm too. Action, romance, deception, great scenery... this movie delivers.",1466985600,,731,4.809523809523809

The villain was non existent, the plot so generic it might as well have been thought of ten minutes before shooting started, and the action is nothing to write home about. They should have kept Patty Jenkins, that's all I can say. Oh well, Marvel's loss is DC's gain.

P.S. Can anyone tell me how the bifrost is back? I thought Thor's big sacrifice was destroying it at the end of the last movie?",1466467200,2,419,4.371794871794871

No reason why there is this love interest particularly because the story seems more geared towards instant gratification and not toward telling a story.  It's like this is tough man Thor.  See Thor Fly.  Thor like Jane.  Thor and Jane fly.  Thor tough guy.  Bad guy hurt Jane.  Thor beat bad guy.  Thor tough guy.  Jane tough guy.  WAIT! Jane is a girl!  What is going on?  So I hear Thor is a woman in the next movie.  I guess she got jealous of him getting all this attention and decided to try to be him instead of using her abilities as a woman to be an amazing woman.  What kind of lame woman thinks becoming a man will make her better?  I mean making humans is so much better than killing them.  For real, man!  I don't like what the writers are doing to Thor.

The deaths (and fake deaths) in this movie are heart wrenching and done very well. We once again examine the complicated brotherly bond between Thor and Loki, and the straining relationship between Thor and Odin. Sets, plot, action, dialogue, all stellar. There's even some fantastic humor in here, most of it between Thor and Loki, who really play off each other wonderfully.",1462838400,,542,4.838709677419355

Her sassy intern was, in fact, amazingly annoying but was, at least, expressive. No, I watched this movie just to look at Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston.

6081709,4,B00GLPCKX8,NICE MOVIE,1461024000,,10,4.5
6081710,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I went into this with relatively high expectations since I greatly enjoyed the first Thor films and to date, have enjoyed the other Marvel film properties - especially ones like Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor 2, however, fell short of expectations and while it's not a bad way to while away a few hours I couldn't help but feel that it really could have been better served.

One of the first things that stands out is the chemistry between Portman and Hemsworth, or rather the lack thereof. Both of them are exceptionally talented actors, but they just don't really feel believable as a couple in this film. Portman was also somewhat dull in her role as Jane. She looked great in every scene, but she just feels like she's more phoning it in than anything else. Since watching the movie I've read that Portman *really* wanted out of the film franchise, so this could be a result of her being in a movie she overall didn't want to do. Again, I love Portman but I'd be happier with her character being either gone or recast with another actress with better on-screen chemistry than what we have here.

Now what does work is the interactions between Hemsworth and Hiddleton, as Thor and Loki. Hiddleston approaches his character with sadistic glee and it's easy to see why he's become a fan favorite. Also excellent was Renee Ruso, who shone as Frigga, and Jaimie Alexander as Lady Sif. I could definitely see a Sif/Thor pairing, since the two worked well off of one another. The action and special effects scenes were also well done, which helped make the film move a little faster, although at times I felt that the movie length could've been tightened to make it flow a little better. I couldn't help but find my attention drifting occasionally during the slower scenes.

In the end the film is good, but not exactly the greatest in the series. So far the Marvel films have been overall good, so this is kind of one of those movies where I'd recommend a rental (like I did) rather than a purchase unless you're a completionist or a huge fan of one of the actors in the film.",1460937600,3,2073,4.552278820375335

Thor has good moments when getting to be a brother and person instead of just a person to throw the hammer. Portman was kind of barely there honestly, I'm not sure what was going on (she can be a brilliant actress) but maybe there just wasn't much opportunity to shine here, she pretty much faded into the background despite getting a ton of screen time.

I enjoyed it once, but especially on a second watching, found it rather drawn out and less fun.",1455667200,,557,4.407766990291262

It just felt a little dragged on at some points that could have been taken out.  I love Jane, I do. But sometimes I feel like she needs to be doing much more as character when she's with Thor or she needs to be on Earth away from him. She didn't do much of anything important for me in this movie. If she had been more proactive and shown she was going to fight and stand off against the others it would have been very interested.

Thor doesn't want her hurt and I understand that but she needs to show she's just as strong as him even if she might not be. I can say that the ending had me very excited for Thor 3. The ending is what made me really enjoy it. With Loki, it will set up a whole bunch a craziness that will happen with Thor.",1451779200,,878,3.899441340782123

6081914,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I paid $20 for this DVD (not even Blueray), and the only extras it had on it was one deleted scene, and a preview for Captain America. It didn't even have commentary. What a waste of money. Next time, I'll buy my movies in a physical store, so I'll know what I'm getting.

This is a good movie with some funny moments (my favorite is when Thor hangs up his hammer on the coat rack), but it isn't better than the first one. Granted, we knew the characters from the last movie, but for the most part, all the characters were flat. None of them evolved, except for maybe Loki. There wasn't one idea in the entire movie that was developed. It was painfully obvious that they had used a different director. I hope for the next one, they go back to the one used for the original Thor. I won't pay twenty bucks for another one like this. Natalie Portman could be directed by a monkey, and still look good. There isn't much for action until the final scene. The ending is as undeveloped as the rest of the movie. Maybe the first film was about Thor, and this one was about Loki, but it didn't center on Loki. Tom Hiddleston's acting is excellent. Chris Hemsworth gave a good performance (he could use a hair brush), but the director didn't use it well. I just don't think the director knew what he wanted, or what to do with what he had. He made Anthony Hopkins look bad. Do you know how hard that is? All the glow and shine from the first movie is absent from this one. Granted, they are at war, but it is everything in the film. The gatekeeper's costume looks like a dime store version of the previous one - it's just all of it. Did they not keep the props or costumes from the first movie? Did they run out of money? Who knows - because there isn't even commentary to tell us friggin' why! This is a good rental, but wait for more features to be added before you buy the DVD.",1448323200,,1870,4.20891364902507

6081942,2,B00GLPCKX8,"This is without a doubt the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen. The only good character is Loki (and he's only in it for 20 minutes), while everyone else is either annoying or bland. The previous Thor film did a good job at introducing audiences to Thor, and in the Avengers he was such a funny but badass character. Here there's not much for him to do but be dull and hit things. The humor in this movie rarely worked and it could get annoying very quickly. The main villain is laughably underdeveloped and is probably the least memorable enemy ever seen in a Marvel movie. There are so many confusing decisions in this movie from a design perspective (why do these people need horses when they have magical flying spaceships?) and a plot perspective (why does Thor trust Loki at all?), but it has so much missed potential, especially in how it could have approached Loki's character who is made more interesting because of the actor's performance.
The only reason I do not despise this movie is because of some cool action scenes and a few good charter moments. Those who feel they need to see this movie in order to get what will happen n later Marvel films should try to stay away from this at all costs.",1447027200,,1209,4.475113122171946

6081969,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Its a bit rubbish but it gets a lot better as the film wears on. The film-makers make a big mistake by taking a subtle actor like Christopher Eccleston putting him in a rubber mask, modulating his voice and subtitling a lot of his dialogue- maybe going for a Lord of the Rings vibe. Whatever his character was, it is smothered. Also Natalie Portman is a liability at this point, she is an oscar winning actress who quite rightly deserves a central place in any film but she has to play Jane Foster essentially a non character ever since her debut in the comics. Sif is so much more interesting in so many ways. Luckily about the time of the funeral scene the film takes a sharp turn for the better.",1445731200,,698,4.33587786259542

After his long absence from the affairs of Earth (or Midgard), the thunder god returns to our planet and to his scientist love Jane Foster. Unfortunately Thor's return is not under the best of circumstances, as a universal threat from the ancient past seeks to undone creation itself. Saving the world, a terminally ill girlfriend, sibling rivalry of epic proportions, and an inhuman race of beings with a bad attitude all make for an exciting film. I recommend this for any comic/Thor fan. :-)",1445212800,,636,4.738738738738738

If you're not a Marvel person, this one is going to be hard to follow as it draws on the other films pretty heavily. The villain is a little bland in this one and could have been done better, but the special effects and acting of Hiddleston are excellent. Portman is uninspired in this one and Hemsworth is Hemsworth. Anthony Hopkins is always fun to see and the direction the plot takes with his character is probably the best aspect of the movie.

6082020,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor and Loki are so watchable, and their painful brotherly dynamic is definitely well done. Plus, the movie is full of spectacular special effects.

But some of the action is confusing and hard to follow, it's hard to believe in a genuine attraction between Thor and Jane, and Jane's obnoxious little sister made me want to cover my ears every time she opened her loud, squeaky mouth. Though Jane's character is intended to be a world-class scientist, she just comes off as not very bright. Odin was a repulsive jerk - it's hard for me to buy into comic book innovations that lessen the fascinating characters of ancient tradition instead of truly bringing them to life.

I would have liked to see Thor's friendships in Asgaard better developed, instead of just presented for a few seconds, and some more development of the villain, who was so one-dimensional that he was actually a weak plot driver.

Anyway, it's worth watching, just not strong enough to be a 5-star as others in the Avengers series are.",1442880000,2,1007,4.775862068965517

6082197,2,B00GLPCKX8,"An ancient enemy of Asgard threatens to attack again--the Dark Elves. They ruled the universe long ago when darkness was supreme and they want to turn out the lights for the rest of the universe now. Odin's father had beaten them 5000 years ago when the nine worlds aligned and their power was at its height. Now another alignment is coming and the elves are back to their old tricks. Thor is ready to fight along with his usual compatriots but when as things go from bad to worst, he has to rely on his scheming evil brother Loki.

The plot is very generic and surprises are mostly not surprising. The Dark Elves are not very interesting as villains because they lack any character or menace to them (in spite of the fact they want to destroy the universe!). They look like ""baddies of the week"" from Star Trek or Doctor Who (which may be a subliminal thing for me since their leader is played in heavy prosthetics by Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston--I recognized his voice about half way through). Loki is easily the best thing about the film. His schemes are interesting and Tom Hiddleston plays him with panache. The other actors are good but the script doesn't give them much to work with. Chris O'Dowd from The IT Crowd has a fun cameo and there are other laugh out loud lines, but not as much as in the first Thor movie. The chemistry between romantic leads Thor and Jane Foster is weak. The ending promises some interesting possibilities in the next movie, so I'm not giving up hope, but I can't recommend this film unless you're a Marvel completionist.",1435795200,,1564,4.565836298932385

6082242,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I'm still trying to catch up on movies I missed in the theater in 2013.  One of those was Thor: The Dark World, so when I saw a friend had bought it, I snagged it right away.  (Yeah, I watched it that week and returned it.)

The story picks up after TheAvengers.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is busy fighting across all the realms to keep any dark and powerful forces at bay.  As a result, he is being treated as a hero and his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) thinks that he might be ready to become king.

The one thing holding him back is Jane Foster (Natalie Portman).  He loved this mortal woman, much to Odin's dismay.  However, she has just stumbled on an anomaly in London that could kill her.  Even worse, it means the Dark Elves, a race that had supposedly been defeated a millennia ago, want her to drain this anomaly from her and use it to take over the nine realms.

I have noticed some issues with superhero movies.  The first one is always an origin story, and it slows the movie down while we wait for the hero to gain their powers and come to terms with it.  Then, in the sequel, they have to up the stakes by giving us two villains.  I actually have to respect this movie because it doesn't try to do that.  Instead, it just tells us the next chapter of the story with the next villain.  Okay, so you could argue there is an army, but they act as one, therefore one villain.

This allows time for some character development, which I felt was a strong point of the film.  Through the action, we got to know many of these characters better, which made us care about the outcome.

However, I must admit I was disappointed with Jane in this movie.  Yes, the love interest is pretty much there just to get in trouble and provide motivation for the hero.  However, I felt her character was weak and worse than normal.  Definitely wish she had played a bigger role before the climax.

On the other hand, there's Tom Hiddleston's Loki.  The character is so rich and troubled, you can't help but sympathize with him even though he's the villain.  Yes, I do love to hate him.

The acting by everyone is wonderful no matter how big or small a part they play in the overall film.  As a Chuck fan, I have to give a special shout out to Zachary Levi who took over the Fandral role since Josh Dallas was tied up with Once Upon a Time.  (An interesting bit of trivia, Zachary was the first choice for the character in the first movie, but he couldn't do it because of Chuck.  Full circle and all that.)

Likewise, the special effects are wonderful.  While I wouldn't expect anything less from a movie of this magnitude, I wasn't disappointed.

Which brings us to my other minor complaint about the film, the climax.  Yes, the final battle has to be epic, but here I felt like it was a bit too frenzied with too much going on.  As a result, I also felt like it went on a tad to long.  I'm being nitpicky here, I realize, but that is how I felt.

Overall, Thor: The Dark World was a fun sequel that was well worth watching, and one that extends the Marvel Universe.  I'm enjoying watching this universe expand with each film.",1434412800,,3117,4.29553264604811

But when I received the film, it had some bright yellow sticker stuck to the case behind the protective wrapping (i ordered this film ""new""). Also, inside of the film was some sort of return receipt. Any who, when I tried to remove the ugly sticker, it wouldn't come off. And when I finally did manage to peel it off (using water), it left behind a permanent sticky residue that is now collecting dust and looks awful.

All in all, I'm mainly disappointed. I've had nothing but great experience with Amazon up until this point. As I took of the protective film and opened the case, I don't know if I can return/replace it or not.",1434067200,,856,4.3105590062111805

But while I don't honestly think that The Dark World is a worse movie than Thor, it fails to meet the challenge that Marvel faces as it inundated us with its universe.  Comic book movies need to keep changing in order to keep from becoming repetitive and redundant, and this movie failed in that respect.  Everything from the plotlines to the jokes felt very color-by-numbers, and in this case the action wasn't on a level that could elevate it.",1432944000,,564,4.456310679611651

This is often the case with such strong origin  films, but still, there are good writers out here (my hand is extended...).  Of course, the talent shows up and does their thing well. I would have liked to see more Odin, More Jane, More Eric Selvig - even more Darcy & 'intern', but Hollyweoird inshits on their share of blowed up cars and buildings... zonkers!

6082406,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Okay I didn't see the first film, so I don't know the mythology of the character.

I did see this one at the theater.  And it was exasperating.

I never really minded Natalie Portman, but she was irritating in this film.  Thor loses his mother, and Jane Foster is whining about herself.  Not even apologetic though she was indirectly responsible.  With no regard for Thor's mother's sacrifice, Jane Foster continues to be insufferable.  She is beautiful and allegedly intelligent, but she suppresses all her good qualities, and she becomes annoying and pathetic.  She is a scientist but the only thing on her mind is this stupid relationship.  Her character was so horrendous, so every time her assistant, Kat Dennings/Darcy Lewis was featured, it was a breath of fresh air.  It was so refreshing to have a break from seeing the whining Jane Foster on screen, and I wish Kat Dennings had been more prominently featured.  Thank goodness The Avengers had little to nothing to do with Jane Foster.

I was filled with hope when told about this film, but Chris Hemsworth/Thor and Tom Hiddleston/Loki's performances were usurped by the sheer deadpan character of Jane Foster.  It even reduced Thor somehow.  Made him stupid for being smitten with such an insipid character.

I don't know whether to blame Natalie Portman, or the way the character was written.  It is just that every time Natalie Portman was on the screen, I felt it would have better if the screen went blank.  She was irritating.  I couldn't fathom Thor's infatuation.  I thought her shallow.  The setting overwhelmed her.  Even something as rudimentary as sand and rock seemed more fundamental and worse, more charismatic than Natalie Portman/Jane Foster.

I went to this film because of an assurance of a friend, and afterwards, she apologized to me.",1429920000,,1814,4.937086092715232

6082434,4,B00GLPCKX8,So Bill and I watched this movie last night and all I have to say is wow. I mean I watched the first one and it was really good but the second one was great. There were so many twist and everything to this movie. Some of the stuff you definitely had to follow this and not blink. I had tried myself because I have add and it is very hard to concentrate on things. Now with Loki ad everything in this I need to hopefully see part 3. Because the way they set it up there will be another one coming. They are going to have to explain the way this one ended. Because the way this ended just left too many things open and I don't understand where it all went wrong. Unless I blinked some where and I missed it. But I know by the way it ended there is a part 3. Which I did look up and part 3 is in the works and we are keeping the same characters. Also it was really cool where they put Stan Lee in this movie because as you know he has a cameo in all his marvel movies.,1428278400,,965,3.8059701492537314

6082450,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor: The Dark World
 This stupendous action/fantasy comic book based flick has brought in $327 million.  It will become stupendously profitable even with a stupendous budget of $170 million.  But just watch the colors and listen to the noise as you view the film.  Stupendous has at its root the core word stupid.  Do not expect a script that makes any sense, just enjoy the show.
 Alan Taylor has directed many different episodes for a number of truly excellent HBO TV series.  Thor: The Dark World is his first big screen outing but producers will salivate to have him make more big, noisy, profitable nonsense films.  That will prosper his bank account but he has more of an artist in him than shows in Thor.  He has directed episodes in such fine series as The Sopranos, Big Love, Deadwood, Game of Thrones and one of my very favorites, Rome.  He used HBO actors Ray Stevenson (Rome) and Idris Elba (The Wire) in Thor: The Dark World.
 Chris Helmsworth, Thor in the film, may have fine acting talent but he is blessed or cursed with such great looks and such a commanding presence that he has not had to demonstrate any actual acting.  The public doesnt care.  In the first Thor movie his fellow actor Kat Dennings had the line that I think sums up Helmsworths function for the film.  When she and Natalie Portman find a stunned Thor she says I would give him mouth to mouth, totally.  He makes an excellent Thor.
 Also in the credits are Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Sakrsgard and Rene Ruso, all fine actors who do credit to their craft.  They do make the film at least interesting from the perspective of watching great actors trying to give life to a muddled story in a movie that depends on special effects for the entertainment value.
 Tom Hiddleston has the plum role as the sly, devious Loki.  I liked his character and his performance.
 The exquisite Natalie Portman plays a beautiful scientist who becomes romantically entangled with the more or less immortal god, Thor.  Apparently the Norse Gods can die in this version of the story.  I will not comment on the opponents except to say they are called the Dark Elves even though their complexions have the color of marsh mellows.  The Dark Elves could be played by people with bags on their heads printed with the words Bad Guy for all the individuality they show.
 Portman is 32, had a baby in 2011 and has a net worth of $45 million.  The flick rates only 3 saw blades.  Two hours long, PG-13 for violence, only smooching, no naked people.",1427414400,,2502,4.578828828828829

6082484,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I was a comic buff in my young days but THOR in my day was a little known hero. Thor comic books were flimsy, not much content, and was not as detailed illustrated like what we called the 'real' comic books, Superman, Batman, Spider-man for example. As pre junior high-schoolers we look at THOR when seeking a comic character to draw as the less details suited our artistic capabilities. Hence while I knew of the character, I knew little about the real story. After reading the many reviews about how this 2nd Thor movie really fleshes out the characters, and looking at the stated running time of just under 3 hours, I say here is my chance to get up to speed.

You see, this 2nd Thor movie is not yet offered for rental by streaming online, which is the only way I have time to view movies in between working on my New Store Business Project these days. Thinking myself a frugal spender I come up with a plan to get in all the recent Thor outings. I rented and watched THOR 1st movie. I rented and watched the Avengers, and I decided to shell out the extra bucks and purchased this 2nd THOR movie thinking well at least I will get 3 Hours worth of entertainment and updates on the THOR story.

Boy was I WRONG and DISAPPOINTED. Plain and simple, I felt CHEATED. First, the actual running time of the Movie is a measly 1 1/2 hours. The rest are trailers and studio plugs available free elsewhere. Secondly, there is nothing more to be learnt of THOR. So now I see why the THOR comic books of my day were flimsy. This 2nd movie is just some of the same from THOR and his same entourage from the 1st movie. I can't say more of the same cause it is less, this 2nd movie is way shorter than the 1st movie!

I gave it 3 stars yes because as far as the Producers, Directors, Writers and Actors go they all did pretty much as good a job as they did in the 1st movie - the writers and producers calling on the mythologies of that era and the sciences of today to provide content and the actors on their rather impressive talents to bring the movie to life. I see no exceptional difference as noted in the many other reviews, so if you want a little bit more of the same this will do.

I would give it 4 stars as a $2 online streaming rental, but at the $15 buy price for the SD version and the $20 asking price for the HD version I can't. I paid for the SD version and I feel really cheated. If Amazon was offering a Money Back Guarantee, I would apply for it and offer to pay $2-$3 for my viewing.",1425600000,,2492,4.16390041493776

An ancient enemy older than Earth itself is back and it is up to Asgard to defeat him as they did before recorded time.

I especially like the line where Thor and Jane are trying to get out of a ""situation.""  Jane was talking on the cell to a guy named Richard(who she had a blind date with) and then a few minutes later, when Thor gets in the car with Jane, asks her, ""Who's Richard?"" Jane says, ""Really?!""
Jane is also slap happy in this movie, I love it! I have always wanted to do that...

There are some great special effects, some half decent battles, and a whole lotta jokes. I still don't much care for Loki as a villain (at least in this incarnation), but the cast in general pulls it off. It's certainly not a classic, but it's a worthy addition to the modern Marvel cannon.",1420502400,,461,4.703703703703703
6082615,5,B00GLPCKX8,Love it!!!,1420502400,,10,4.5
6082616,2,B00GLPCKX8,"I loved the first Thor movie, but this was a disappointment.  The first one had a story that while focused on a small scale environment, it was a very good story that made sense.  Here, although it gives us a good look at some of the other 7 realms it isn't as interesting because there are a lot of problems with the story.  I was looking forward to seeing Jane reunited with Thor, but they needed a better reason for her to come into the story than just stumbling across the Aether in an unbelievable coincidence and having it possess her.  There were several other big plot-holes.  How exactly did Malekith know what everything was like after 5,000 years?  Don't you think things would have changed enough that it would have taken more time for him to plan?  Why was there a prison underneath the palace?  Wouldn't Odin want to have it as far away from the palace as possible?  And why was Thor so slow returning from the prison riot?  I he hadn't of been so slow, Freda wouldn't have gotten killed and I would not have left the movie, flawed as it was.  I'm not exactly a purist when it comes to the changes the movies make to the comics, but that was a horrible change.  It was an unnecessary death that lead to pointless angst.  My father agreed with me, but my mother and aunt continued to watch it.  I did return towards the end though.  I will admit the final battle was pretty exciting.  In fact, some of the action scenes are the best thing about this film, though I also enjoyed the stingers and the performance of Christopher Eccleston as Malekith (he's one of my least favorite Doctor Whos, but he's a very good actor; I'll never be able to read any of Malekith's lines in the comics without hearing his voice).  But those are the only good things about the film.  The action may have been exciting at times, but it doesn't matter when you don't really care about the story, and I was very disappointed when it was revealed that Loki took over Asgard.  Overall, I am not looking forward to Thor 3.  In fact, I'm very worried about the rest of Phase 2.  But no matter what, I'm staying with the Marvel Cinematic Universe until Avengers 2 at least.",1420502400,,2160,4.390428211586902

6082635,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Another Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that was pumped out to keep people interested until Avengers: Age of Ultron. The villain is lame and 1-dimensional (he wants to turn off the dark, like Spider-man's lame broadway musical), Thor and Jane's romance was forced and they y lacked any real chemistry.

Too much focus was put on Loki, I know people love him, but even when he was involved, he didn't do much. Loki is killed, but just like the first movie where he died by falling to his death, it's revealed later he is still alive (they do the character dies/isn't really dead BS in EVERY MARVEL STUDIOS MOVIE).

Kat Dennings is back with her annoying character, who has her own even more annoying sidekick to make the movie even more grating. We get to see more of Asgard, that was pretty cool.

Like Iron Man 3, the love interest beats the main villain of the film instead of the hero, because Marvel is terrified of being labeled sexist. Sure, Thor holds off Malekith while Jane prepares the device, but it's ultimately Jane who beats the baddie.

Finally comes the freaking ending, which is a MASSIVE PLOTHOLE.

Thor is unable to see through Loki's illusion and can't tell that it's Loki in disguise as their father. But just earlier in the movie after their mother's death, Thor goes to speak to Loki who has trashed his cell and is sitting disheveled and in mourning over the only person he really cared about besides himself. Loki is using an illusion to appear like his usual smug self, but Thor can see through it. But then at the end? He can't. Why? Because the series needs to rely on the plot hole to warrant more freaking Loki later.

The New York references were annoying as well. Like we need reminders that the Avengers happened. Watching Jane slap Loki while saying, ""That was for New York"" was eye-roll worthy.

The movie was average, and frankly, I think the solo movies are pointless at this point, since everyone only watches them to stay occupied while waiting for the next Avengers.",1419984000,,2006,4.633802816901408

6082657,1,B00GLPCKX8,One random action movie cliche after another. Absolute trash.,1419638400,,61,5.888888888888889
6082658,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The Dark world is a continuation of Thor and Loki's story after the events of The Avengers. Loki is brought back to Asgard and thrown in prison. Christopher Eccleston plays the lead bad guy Malekith, who is trying to not only bring down Asgard, but gain power over the 9 realms by taking advantage of the realms converging. Thor ends up breaking Loki out of prison to help him track down Malekith.

Of course the movie is heavy on action and special effects, which look and sound great on blu ray. They tell enough of a story and do try to in a sense resolve the Thor/Loki storyline (at least from one of the character's standpoint), and also did a good job with, at least for the first part of the movie, avoiding the question of why not just get the Avengers to help? Theoretically they could have assisted in the final battle, but in the Asgard and Dark World battles there was no way for them to get there. That said, Captain America does make a pretty hilarious cameo.

The movie also rekindles the Jane/Thor relationship as he continues struggling between his duties to Asgard and his feelings for her. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgrd reprise their roles, but neither are really given much to do. Dennings is really there for comic relief, which she does well, and to an extent Skarsgrd is as well. While Jane is central to the plot, there are times when she cannot do anything because she is basically sitting on the sidelines of battles between essentially immortal beings (at least as compared to her).

By this point you really have to look at the Marvel Movies (and even to some extent Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D) as one big intertwined story. This definitely had the feel of a filler movie to get to Avengers 2, where we know more will happen. Unlike Winter Soldier, which I think was on par with, if not better than First Avenger for Captain America's story, I do not think this worked as well as the first Thor movie. Partly because I think the fish-out-of water, god with no power on Earth thing had a great comedic element that this movie did not, and could not based on the story. That said, if you are a fan of the genre and the whole ""Marvel Universe"" movies I think it is worth checking out.

For those who get the actual disc, as I said, the movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray. For bonus features there is a mockumentary on The Mandarin (the villain from Iron Man III) that was included here for some reason. Then a multi-part making of/behind the scenes feature on the movie and the story. A first look at Captain America 2, a gag reel, deleted scenes and a feature on scoring the movie. All in all, good for what is there, with about an hour plus worth of extra content.",1419552000,3,2695,4.438383838383839

6082663,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Oy. You have to be a really hardcore Marvel fan not to find this a terrible remake. It lacks just about everything that made the original work: a strong story line, a sense of majesty balanced by a quirky sense of humor, a brightness and lightness, a smart use of CGI. ""Dark World"" indeed -- the CGI here is so sloppy and murky that it's often impossible to tell what the heck is supposed to be going on. The end credits list about 10,000 programmers, as blockbuster all-CGI movies always do now. Not one of them noticed? Ponderous and lackluster, it's yet another blatant and cynical effort by the Marvel Empire to cash in on the fanboys' eagerness to play patsy.",1419292800,,664,4.4958677685950414

You can write a thousand adventure stories about Thor, his family, and friends. Love Chris Hemsworth and glad he was cast for Thor. I do agree he has the voice for the big man Thor represented. I also love Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, and Rene Russo. Excellent cast members! I love the fighting scenes and special weapons. The special affects, storyline, set details especially in Asgard were absolutely amazing and beautiful. I loved the architect and design of the buildings, rainbow bridge, Odin's throne, the floors, the walls, even the prison was beautiful. The musical score was most excellent! I watched it several times and can't get enough of him. Can't wait to see Thor 3 with Thor and Loki! Hurry up and make it already lol! Thanks for an excellent movie!

6082767,4,B00GLPCKX8,"What I liked about watching Thor: The Dark World is the twists in the story it had! I loved all the special effects and the fighting scenes were really epic! The mystery in the beginning of the movie kept me in great suspense to know what is going on. Chris Hemsworth could not be a better fit for Thor in these movies. Its a perfect match for the character.
  A favorite part of this movie is seeing Loki in his cell and the way he is acting while being a prisoner. I would definitely watch this movie again in the future. This is a classic action hero movie with the story going places you didn't even think that it would. A great movie for fans of the awesome Thor!",1416009600,,668,4.170542635658915
6082768,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I've heard people say that the preview is about as good as the actual film, and although I quite disagree with that statement, I'll admit that sometimes the preview makes the movie look more epic then it really is.
 Last year, before this film was released, I saw the preview, and I estimated that it would be a little better then the first Thor, but in November, when I want to see it in theaters, I quickly discovered how wrong I was.
 This movie was one of the best films of all time! (Almost as good as the two ""Hobbit""s out so far)
 I knew this pretty much as soon as I saw the new and improved ""Marvel"" logo, which was designed in just a way, that made you know that this was going to be an awesome film, and as the film went on, it just seemed to prove itself more and more.
 Firstly, this movie had more action and adventure then the first film, and the stakes are so much higher in this film then any of the other ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" films to date.
 Secondly, the scenery and locations of this film were amazing. While the first Thor covers only a small part of Asgard, New Mexico, and Jtunheimr, Thor 2 covers even more of Asgard then the first, The Dark World, Another Asian-like world, and London. It even has a cameo of Jtunheimr.
 I also have to say that the music is totally memorable and extremely adds to the movie, and it is great that more characters get to join in the adventure, such as Jane, Darcy, and even this new guy named Ian (the intern of an intern), And as a Christian, it is a relief to here Odin say that they are not gods (maybe not so much for the myth believers though).
 The only major thing that I can say that I don't like in this movie, is Eric at Stonehenge. Unfortunately it lowers my review of this film to four stars instead of five.
 But over all, if you look away when the news reporter is reporting from Stonehenge, the film should be an extremely positive experience, and the only way to top it off would be if the third film is about Ragnarok, which is the Norse Mythology prophecy of the end of the world and Asgard. (I know if it is or not, but you're going to have to look it up on your own if you really want to know.)
 I am obviously going to try to see the next Thor when it comes out.",1416009600,,2247,4.135321100917431

6082819,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I have one confession to make and something to get off my chest before I start my review: I LOVE THOR, nothing against Captain America or Hulk or Iron Man but I find there's a wonderful purity to this character. He's not a poster boy like Steve Rogers, not a brilliant self obsessed billionaire like Stark, he takes the world as it is and does what he can to keep the peace. Almost like a universal godly enforcer of sorts. What I need to get off my chest is that one of the things that makes Thor so much fun to watch is that you have a universe to play with and no shortage of villains/perils to be encountered then systematically overcome. The sequel to Thor has a variety of elements in play from the first film yet there is more gravity and everything feels more fleshed out. The chemistry between Thor and Jane Foster is wonderfully done yet doesn't steal the show from the seriousness of the situation. Thor's comrades are also given more freedom and plausibility. Loki for once, doesn't steal the show but you see what I've been wanting to see brought forth, a villain who challenges Loki's brilliance and savagery in a death in the family. Loki's triumph in the end is not one born of malicious trickery but rather a tempered understanding of power. As a Hemsworth fan, I have to say he has the same ability as the late Patrick Swayze to carry the most unlikely of successful films.",1414108800,,1391,4.458823529411765

6082825,4,B00GLPCKX8,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Successful depictions of mythological tales embrace both their grandeur and bizarre but entertaining illogic. Marvel Comics' ""Thor"" recognized this, as did the original ""Thor"" movie, and now its more cosmic, world-spanning sequel, ""Thor: The Dark World"" (hereafter ""Thor: DW"").  Even though not only Earth (Midgard) but all the Nine Realms of Norse legend including Asgard, abode of the gods, are threatened by an existence-ending ""Dark Side"" as embodied by the liquid Aether, ""Thor: DW"" manages to intersperse and sprinkle dry, understated,  but sharp humorous dialogue and situations throughout its epic tale.

This is no trivial feat, since along with the expected warrior battles and clashes and imminent Armageddon (or Ragnarok), ""Thor: DW"" deals with forbidden mortal love, latent mortal/deity romantic jealousy, incorrigible and enigmatic siblings, obstinate and imperious fathers, self-sacrificing goddesses, unhinged astronomical geniuses, and charting your own destiny.  Within each of these elements ""Thor: DW"" explores both their serious and light-hearted sides.

Pointy-eared but cruelly saturnine Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the Dark Elves' leader seeks the Aether to bring back the darkness they need to live and extinguish the hated brilliance of Asgard and the other worlds.  The Asgardians, led by Thor wielding his enchanted hammer Mjolnir, have managed to wrest the Aether from the Dark Elves and hidden it within what they think is a totally unexpected place.  However, astrophysicist and Thor's mortal love interest Jane Porter, incensed by the Thunder God's long absence, attempts to locate a dimensional portal in order to contact him again.  Concealed within a London warehouse district, she finds not only the portal, but the Aether as well.  The Aether possesses her.

Malekith, with the brutal assistance of the ape-like juggernaut (no, not that Juggernaut) Algrim/Kurse, has sought to recover the Aether for over 5,000 years and use it for universal darkness once the Nine Realms are linearly aligned.  Realizing that Jane has now become the Aether's vessel, Thor transports her to Asgard in an initial attempt to protect her from Malekith.  Nevertheless, Malekith, Algrim, and the Dark Elf armada of dagger-shaped ships soon breach even Asgard's seemingly-impervious defenses.

Against the edicts of the Lord of Asgard and Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor decides that instead of remaining beseiged behind Asgard's fortress, he will take Jane to true safety in an obscure dimension.  To do this, he must free and make an uncertain Faustian alliance with the God of Deceit and Evil, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), imprisoned in an Asgardian dungeon for crimes he committed in the ""Avengers"" movie.  To buy time for the escape, Thor asks the omniscient, all-sensing Guardian of Asgard Heimdall(Idris Elba) to risk treason by running interference for him.  And so ""Thor: DW"" boils down to whether Thor can save Jane and the Nine Realms (including Earth) from Malekith and the Aether.

Yep, these are literally deadly serious issues the movie is dealing with.  But with effortless skill, ""Thor: DW"" sees the inherent overwrought silliness of it all and gently teases and prods it without diminishing the importance of these issues.  For example, Thor faces a towering, Goliath stone creature in a scene that might remind you of Indiana Jones and the swordsman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". As another example, to help the jailbreak along, Loki transforms himself and Thor into various figures including an out-of-left field patriotic one.  Back on Earth, Jane's brash intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) sardonically and bemusedly comments on the wild proceedings when the Thor/Malekith battle spills over onto Midgard.  Jane's oddball but enthusiatic mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, committed for streaking at Stonehenge, has nevertheless seemed to discover a gravity-shifting device that might avert the alignment, provided Darcy and her own callow but cute intern can get him out of the mental hospital. Finally, loved all the dimension-hopping and throwaway critters, especially in the very last scene.

The humor also makes ""Thor:DW"" more relatable even to people who are not Thor or Norse mythology aficionados and fans.  Without it (and without the introductory exposition) at the movie's beginning, newcomers might be at a bit of a loss as to who these outlandish characters are and what the heck they're fighting for.  They might not know who grim Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), dashing Fandral (Zachary Levi), voluminous Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), or the stunning Sif (Jaime Alexander) are, but they know about romantic entanglements (Sif gives Jane such a stare), a son's duty to a father (Thor in Odin's shadow), and perseverance in finding the hidden bravery and self-sacrifice of a previously selfish and treacherous brother (Loki's helping Thor defend Jane), and finding the courage to blaze your own trail in life (Thor resolving to stay with Jane on Earth).  Therefore, ""Thor:DW"" manages the neat trick of making Armageddon not only foreboding but also satisfyingly enjoyable. 4.5 stars

P.S.:  ""Thor:DW"" is a self-contained story in and of itself, even if you haven't seen the first ""Thor"" movie.  But I heartily recommend you see the first movie, and watch the credits of this movie, because they continue Thor's story and raise doubts about Loki's reformation, AND connect to a broader Avengers story line involving some powerful stones.  Verily, Thor will return.",1414022400,,5535,5.417249417249417

I didn't like it as much as Winter Soldier or Iron Man 3, but I still enjoyed it.

As usual, the best performance for my taste was Tom Hiddleston's Loki.  He has produced the most identifiable and relatable villain for the bigscreen in decades.  Chris Hemsworth also does well with Thor.  He behaves just as I imagined Thor would, while reading those comic books oh so long ago.

""THOR - The Dark World"" effortlessly weaves the mutiple story lines of the first THOR movie and the first Avengers movie into a compelling sequel of love and sacrifice.
Two years has passed since the events chronicled in THOR and The Avengers. Thor has been fighting to restore peace to all of the nine relams while back on here on Earth, Jane Foster has been searching for a way to find the Norse god that she loves.
While exploring a gravational anomly in London; Jane accidently walks into a hidden relam where dark matter from before the birth of the universe had been tucked away for safe keeping. Jane becomes infected with the dark matter and is no longer visible to the Watcher. Panicked, Thor returns to Earth to hunt for Jane, who reappears and promptly slaps him twice - just to sure she tells Thor that he's real.
Thor takes Jane to Vallahala to get her medical treatment when the dark matter infection begins to takes it toll on her.
Meanwhile, the Dark Elves, come out of hiding to set in motion a plan to destroy the universe and return it to darkness. Some highly hysterical cameos are in this movie.
Highly Recommended!

6082866,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Another Thor movie.
  This isn't meant as a negative, just, really, what are you going to do?  The villain was decent, drawn from Walt Simonson's run as Thor's artist/writer. No real character development, other than Thor's deeper concern for others following The Avengers.  Loki continues as the stand-out (Tom Hiddleston is terrific).
  The real take-away is the end sequence, when Sif and Volstagg deliver Malekith's stone to the Collector, where it is revealed to one of the Infinity Gems, of which the Tesseract from Captain America is revealed to be a part of.  Which leads into Guardians of the Galaxy.
  Marvel is doing terrific work tying the parts of their universe together.  Thor: The Dark World is another stepping stone (no pun intended) in Marvel's march.",1413072000,,770,5.0396825396825395

6082881,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The planetary convergence is coming, and barriers between realms are breaking down.  This sets the stage for a fantastic installment in the Thor series.  An ancient weapon of great power spawns an epic conflict.  Loki, who was a great foil in the first Thor movie, adds a lot of surprise twists to Dark world.  Great flick if you like Thor movies, lots of gratuitous shots to please the ladies in the audience, and a great set up for a follow-up episode - Classic Stan Lee - look close, Stan makes his usual cameo appearance.",1412726400,,525,4.553191489361702

6082942,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I was really skeptical that they could catch the magic of the first movie in this sequel. But, well, they did. There are a few points in the film where it felt a little flat, but the relationship that is evolving between Thor and Loki is something that this movie really does well. As is with the first film, all of this movies great moments take place on Asgard, and while I want the stuff taking place on Earth to be great it's just not. It's good, but not great. That could be because the setting on Asgard is such that it takes you away from Earth and all of the other super hero movies, which made it different. When Thor comes to Earth it feels exactly like any other super hero movie.

Still it is worth a rental or a purchase simply for the fact that Loki and Thor get ample time together to continue to build an on screen relationship.",1410912000,,844,4.209876543209877

6082989,3,B00GLPCKX8,"OK, the first movie was really surprisingly clever and fun. But this one feels phoned-in. Lots of over the top action, pseudo-Shakespearean dialogue, tortured plot twists, pompous villains and Anthony Hopkins over-acting. The only really fun part is watching Stellan Skarsgard run around naked. There's no chemistry between Thor and Jane, and while Tom Hiddleston hams it up playing the snarky, mischievous Loki, in the end the script fails him. And what's with Chris Hemsworth's accent anyway? Isn't he Australian? Ah, who cares, he's adorable.",1409961600,,545,5.423529411764706

6083033,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Terrible writing, deus ex machina, shallow characters, forced interactions and incomplete or incoherent world building combine with logical inconsistencies to ruin a movie trying too hard to ride upon its brand and a massive special effects budget.

First, lets address the Elephant on the Planet. This movie shares its Universe with the Avengers. Last time an alien menace arrived on earth and threatended the planet as a whole the entire Avengers team showed up. So...where are they now? Why don't they emerge to assist Thor in defending their world? This logical inconsistency is already a significant drag on the film and undermines any internal consistency the movie strived to build.

Fortunately, it didn't strive very hard. The plot is a mess of science so poory articulated within the film that even referring to is using the prefix pseudo is too generous a thing. Furthermore, the characters are shallow. Once again we get Kat Dennings playing her television character Max, only this time, she's managed to get a college degree in something she plainly understands little better than manners. Natalie Portman as Thor's love interest (with whom he' spent all of 5 earth days) also feels very forced and even contrived. And the other scientists get worse from there.

As for Thor himself, well...its nor surprising to find a director from Game of Thrones behind this mess. That series's penchant for having characters make the worst possible decisions under every circumstance follows from Martin's books, but it also rears its ugly head here in Thor's sudden decision to trust Loki almost completely. Certainly he NEEDS Loki at one point - and then could have been well rid of him. But no, in true Ned Stark fashion he continues to trust people he shouldn't for pretty much the length of the film, helping to place a world at risk while also setting up yet another sequel I for one have no intention of watching.

All told, Dark World should have stayed Dark. As in, Lost in Production. Its a terrible plot filled with holes and dependent on science that doesn't make any sense even within the context of the plot its supposed to satisfy (and which it subsequently fails completely to rescue). The characters are shallow, one dimensional stereotypes; to call them 'uninteresting' is to lend too much credence to their performance herein. Thor's second outing should really be his last. I never thought I would see a film I thought Michael Bay could improve on, but at least having him at the helm, folks would have gone in expecting nothing more than the over the top CGI and poor writing and plot they ultimately received.",1409011200,10,2632,4.921171171171171

6083047,5,B00GLPCKX8,Although Thor is my favorite comic book character and find this film to be fantastic -- I have not bought it to date because there is no bluesy-DVD combo. This is a marketing strategy to cheat the customer and charge excessive rates to get both formats separately. I hope that strategy has failed for Marvel and I see Spiderman 2 has been released in the customary bluesy-DVD combo. Still waiting for the correction on Thor 2.,1408838400,,426,4.618421052631579

But the story got lost in a whole bunch of aether and convergence mumbo jumbo.  I know it's from a comic book company so I don't expect it to be sensible.  However, the movie wasted entirely too much time with the nonsense when it could have been fleshing out the bare bones story.  And what was up with Natalie Portman?  She was a great character in Thor 1.  She's on screen a lot in Thor 2 but she wasn't given much of anything to do.  Check it out when you watch it.",1408752000,,576,3.9391304347826086

NO, because you come to realize there is no real substance to the characters and storyline.  It RELIES on effects and costumes, and in the end a story without heart, growth, and learning is BS and NOT worth your time.

This is for the geeks and nerds with no core to their hearts.  POINTLESS",1407715200,3,460,4.352941176470588

6083098,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I primarily bought this for my sound system at the house. Was impressed, but felt movies like the Avengers and Iron Man 3 had better audio. I didn't expect this to be a mind blowing film but was good enough for me to enjoy it multiple times and will probably have a Marvel Marathon eventually. Beyond that, the film was good enough to watch the following day and will watched again a 3rd time in less than week of owning it. The story was decent, sound was great, but visuals felt to dark. I understand its ""Thor the dark world"" but felt the film had a dark screen over it. Its still highly detailed on blu ray, just scenes that should have been brighter had a dark tinge to it. Not a defect of the bluray disk. The movie was just shot darker. Actions scenes are well done and I actually liked it a lot regardless of anything negative sounding in my review. In my opinion, better than Iron Man 3 but not as over the top as The Avengers. The story is easy to follow and there is a hidden preview when watching the credits like most Marvel films when you see the Collector getting a hold of an Infinity Gem.  The acting is good as well. I only found Janes assistant (the woman, not Ian the male) as annoying. Beyond that, everyone else did a good job.",1407715200,,1249,4.2259414225941425

The characterization of Loki--a character a lot of viewers are quite fond of--is particularly mediocre. Take lessons from Joss Whedon and Kenneth Branagh, writers/producers. They know what they're doing.
The actual villain was not interesting. Jane Foster continues to be boring, and Odin continues to be an ass. I expected better.
However, Mama Frigga was amazing. I'm sure Rene Russo was kind of ""What am I doing in a movie like this?"" but damn, she was excellent. She should be proud. ^_^",1407110400,4,588,4.8316831683168315

My primary reason for purchasing the digital copy (and selecting a 5-star rating) is that I noted something that I rarely see, and that I also hope becomes more prevalent in the Amazon Instant Video offerings:  Digital Exclusive Bonus Features

Bonus features were always an incentive for me when considering purchasing actual DVD/Blu Ray copies.

if Amazon Instant Video added an ""Extras and Features"" option to the Amazon Instant Video User Interface, when the desire hits to watch Featurettes and Extras, I believe the user experience would be even better.

As it is now, you have to fast-forward to the end of the movie.  Providing the option to jump directly to the Extras and Features (when included.., and I hope this becomes the standard) would greatly enhance the User Experience.

6083253,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This is a great movie. If you liked the first Thor, you will love this one. Marvel is on a roll with the entire Avengers line of movies. Thor  : TDW is well paced, well acted, full of action and great dialogue. It really pulls you into the Thor world.
The Blu-ray edition is perfect. Image and sound quality are top notch. I have also watched the Digital HD copy which I have in Vudu.com. Excellent quality as well.
I have watched some of the extra features. They were worth the watch and a nice addition to the movie. I'm not a huge extra feature person, but the little extra clips or deleted scenes are something I like to watch. I appreciate it when they put them in using the same format, quality (1080p) and sound (5.1 or better).",1404777600,,735,4.287769784172662

6083266,5,B00GLPCKX8,"What a follow up! Usually a sequel rarely manages to equal the original movie. In Thor: The Dark World they have managed to carry the movie along the same lines as the original Thor & even bringing in the Avengers movie. One of my favorite parts of this movie is how many times Natalie Portman slaps people. And she is right to do so. This movie contains some of the best computer graphics that I have seen. It has also stayed pretty true to the Marvel comics edition of Thor. Which has stayed very true to the original Norse myths about their gods & worlds.
It is nice to see that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It is serious when it needs to be but still manages to inject humor into a lot of the parts of it. Some of which you've seen on some trailers.
If you are a Thor fan you must get this movie. If you are a Marvel fan you need to get this movie. If you are a fan of good action/fantasy movies then this needs to be in your collection.
And if you like good movies, then get this one.",1404604800,,1006,4.085858585858586

I would have loved to have a digital copy of this movie added to my amazon or Vudu library. Even the price for a digital and Blue-ray copy for the first Thor was higher than most.  So, to sum up.

Anyway, gonna watch it a few more times to make sure I didn't miss anything.  Oh and the first Thor too, oh and The Avengers too.  Mr Chris Hemsworth you are quite the Immortal God like person.

6083294,3,B00GLPCKX8,"The movie is well made, as are all the entries in the franchise.  The acting is up to expectations, as is the convoluted plot.
However, the film definitely suffers from ""middle of a trilogy"" syndrome.  It tries to link the past and future together, and accomplishes that.  It doesn't, however, stand on its own very well.
First, the enemy seems made up, with no connection elsewhere in the franchise, and their abilities seem to flop between nearly-invincible and too-easy to beat.  Their infiltration and attack on Asgard is so easy that it makes you wonder why they lost the first time.  The climactic battle does the same, with the enemy leader too easy to take down.
Second, the escape from Asgard sequence, while busy, seems contrived more than necessary.  How many ways are there to get into/out of the place anyway?
Third, the ending was so obviously a setup fort he next film as to lack any impact at all.  You could also see it coing a mile away.",1404000000,,955,4.615384615384615

When the focus is on Thor and Loki the movie is at its best.  Their interaction, action and tension are done quite well.

6083340,5,B00GLPCKX8,"If you liked the original ""Thor"", your not going to be disappointed with this sequel. The storyline continues 2 years later from the original,and as the predecessor, this too has awesome graphics and special effects. The rainbow bridge has been repaired and even reinforced with towers and suspensions which is really a sight to see. The movie is full of action and drama, especially with the new characters,enemies introduced. The dark elves. I don't want to go into any detail so as not to spoil it for anyone. They also tastefully tell the love story between the hero Thor and Jane, who was left waiting for Thor's return in the first movie. The movie even cleverly makes reference to Thor's return to earth in 'The Avengers', to which Jane makes us aware of  and also she being a little pissed because Thor neglected to stop by or even say ""hi"" to her. We also learn that Loki survived his fall from the rainbow bridge, for those who did not see 'The Avengers', who our hero is forced to employ in a plan to save Jane and prevent Asgard and its inhabitants from any further harm. Part of the story is a planetary alignment is occurring during the course of events, and some of the fight scenes that occur between our hero and his new antagonist are incredible with the both of them falling and going back and forth between realms. The special effects make it so realistic and the job is seamless and spectacular. There is so much for the viewer to enjoy , and the story never gets boring. This is definitely a must see for those who have seen the original, and will most likely make viewers who missed it want to see it.",1403049600,,1624,4.486486486486487
6083341,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This is another big time winner in my book. The moments where you want to pump your first and say, ""YES!"" are all over this movie. Hero comes back and restarts relationship with pining girlfriend, YES! Great effects, check. Awesome villain and really nasty minions, Check. Lots of magically weapons, check. You get to see characters that are evolving into favorites, check. All the realms in dire straights, doom a certainty, check.

Bummer: People die that will be missed by all. Beloved characters murdered. And the righteous fury is now due.

But seriously, this is a better than average for Marvell. Iron man. Spider man. Superman. All have made a triumphant return to the big screen making us old geeks, not so geeky anymore. When I tell my 24 year old son that I was reading about Thor when I was twelve he just can't stand it. Sheesh, young people. They think they invented everything. But this Thor has, I have to admit, a whole load of 'More Awesome' than what I read when Led Zepplin was #1 on the charts.
And Lokie...wow...Lokie turns out to be one of my favorite Marvell heroes of all time. He, perhaps, makes the biggest ""YES!"" moment of the whole movie when he turns out to be a decent sort, in his own way; "" don't trust me brother...trust my rage!""

6083350,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This was a very enjoyable entry into the Marvel Universe Mythos.

The actors are very good; Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth are just fine, thank you - their chemistry works well and if not quite Bogey and McCall well at least Powell and Loy. And, oh my, Tom Hiddleston, while he didn't quite steal the show his protrayal of Loki shows why actors love playing villains - they are just so much fun. And Stan Lee's cameo was a hoot.

Actually the whole durn cast was pretty right on for me. Jamie Alexander as Sif didn't get enough screen time, nor did Idris Alba as Baldur, just to mention two. To adequately praise the individual cast members would require listing the entire cast.

The production is what we've come to expect of Marvel, loud and explosive with new colors being invented every scene it seems. Asgard looks a lot like the Kirby-esque goth I remember from reading the comics as a kid, yet it also seemed more functional, like a real, breathing city that you'd actually want to visit.

There are aspects of the storyline that are a little outre, but hey, it's essentially a motion comic and suspension of disbelief is mandatory when you buy the ticket. As much as I did dislike some of the plot elements I didn't dislike them all that much and they were internally consistent enough to not be too annoying.

But the real story is the relationship between Thor and Loki and that story is so satisfying. But then again, the story between Thor and Loki has ALWAYS been the real story, even in the original myths. And Tom Hiddleston is such a satisfying Loki. Look at me, I'm going all fanboy here. Sheesh.

So, Yah, watch this. It's 112 minutes well spent.",1402876800,,1670,4.55

6083358,1,B00GLPCKX8,"This is the kind of movie that I should like - but I don't. I really liked 'John Carter' and I also was very pleased with 'Battleship'. I also liked the 'Godzilla' with Mathew Broderick. So as you can see I'm fond of a lot of Sci-Fi movies that the critics tell me are bad. But I hated 'Pacific Rim' and all the Transformer movies. I also hated the first 'Thor'.

No that's not completely true. I liked the character Thor in 'The Avengers' and I liked about half of the first 'Thor'. I liked the parts on earth but not those in Asgarde.  Alas this sequel is mostly in Asgarde. It is no better that the first one.

I like Chris Hemsworth but almost no one else.  Natalie Portman is as others have noted, unlikeable. Anthony Hopkins has nothing to offer. He's old, small, and chubby - hardly a God king. Hiddleston is marvelous . Idris Elba is just a token to attract the black audience - it's not enough. You keep wondering what an African is doing that far north? Ray Stevenson who was one of the few bright spots in the first film is hardly in this picture at all.

6083365,4,B00GLPCKX8,"It's no secret that I've always hated superhero movies. I find them to be cliche, over the top, and so far from reality, that often time the stories are just the lowest form of Science Fiction. The only movies of the superhero genre that I've ever truly enjoyed are the recent Batman trilogy and some of the recent Marvel films. That being said, I hated the first Thor film, because it came directly from a comic book and lacked any kind of background story whatsoever. Thanks in part to the Avengers and the development of the Loki character, that all changes with the second film. The story isn't directly from a comic book, but rather based on one. In this film, the characters are more established and there is a lengthy background story that only enhances the film, and the series. In the second film, Thor is tasked with stopping a deadly weapon, possessed by an all but extinct species. This weapon has the power to destroy the entire universe and as always, the focal point is on Earth. Unable to stop the weapon and save his girlfriend at the same time, Thor turns to an unlikely source for help, his now imprisoned brother, Loki. Given the magnitude of the story and the power of the enemy, I'm a bit surprised that they didn't keep this film to be used as an Avengers sequel, as it has all the makings of an epic sequel. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and this time he is beyond terrific. His role in the Avengers really enhanced the popularity of a character that most people were unfamiliar with, and the tremendous start to the film really set the framework for Hemsworth to take Thor to the next level. Even the supporting cast steps it up a notch as Natalie Portman is more used to the idea of a boyfriend from another world and being involved in things she couldn't possibly understand. Finally, Tom Hiddleston tops of the story, with his portrayal of Loki. I may be going out on a limb here, but I thought Hiddleston was even better in The Dark World than he was in The Avengers. Going into the Avengers, next to The Hulk, Thor was the weakest of the introduction films, and the least known and appreciated character. That all changed with the Avengers and in his second film, the Thor character steps up to a level that rivals even Iron Man. If you're not that into the series and have only selectively seen a few of the films, make sure you include the Dark World, as it is essential to fully understanding Thor and his impact in the future of the series.",1402185600,,2486,4.465934065934066

Loki is so fantastic - I just can't get enough of him and hope things change and he's in the next Avengers too - this movie shows the range of this comic book villain.  The villains are often shallow and just evil which is BORING.  Loki never bores.  Chris is deep and brooding in this and I disagree with anyone who says that Natalie Portman is as boring as she was in Star Wars.  She's not doing more than filling her contract in a lot of it but she's well cast and is very funny in many places.  Nothing beats her intern and her intern's intern for comic relief (except Loki).

6083385,5,B00GLPCKX8,Another great 3D movie to add to my collection. I actually thought the story of this movie was better than the first. Like them both very much as I do all the Avengers and especially good in 3D. Not quite to the level of IMAX but the next best this for at home.,1401580800,,261,3.943396226415094

6083387,4,B00GLPCKX8,As an avid fan of the marvel movie series it is required that you watch all of the movies since there are cameo appearances and then of course because the series continues to build on each one. I was not thrilled with the first Thor movie I thought it was incredible slow paced and was definitely not on the edge of my seat like I have been in some of the other movies in the Marvel world. That being said I thought this second Thor was definitely an improvement on the last one. While it still had its slow parts for the most part it had me much more engaged and had greatly improved action scenes.,1401580800,,599,4.172413793103448

In fact, all of the other Marvel movies fall short in my opinion, so I wasn't going into this with high expectations & didn't really want to see it. But one of my coworkers suggested I give it a try & boy was I blown away! Not only was the story line tighter & more intricate, you get to see some real emotions & chemistry from the characters. Not to mention the action and the spot -on humor. If only all the Marvel movies were as good, I might actually spend money on more than just this one. Needless to say, if you haven't seen this yet, run out & watch it!

I was having computer problems at the time, and the email has gone 'poof'.  The only thing Amazon says is that they'll offer me a 1 time digital 'rental' of this movie.  That's not what I paid for.

Also on board is Stellan Skarsgrd as Eric Selvig.  Tom Hiddleston does a great job as the guy who is never who you think he is. Christopher Eccleston is wasted as the the guy out to destroy the 9 realms.  Had very little that could be called acting to do.. Loads of action, good story as long as you ignore all the sophisticated artillery that's mixed with the swordplay. But a lot of fun! I would see it again",1401148800,,576,4.324074074074074

Over all she is a fine actress and I think had the writing and directing been better her over all performance would have been 5 instead of 4 stars. Rennee Russo was awesome.

To many things going on that took away from the main story (which was difficult to determine). Was the main story Thor's relationship with his friends (especially the girl warrior), or was it about Jane, his relationship with his father, his brother.

Bad, bad.",1400544000,2,96,3.8
6083445,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I've enjoyed the Thor movies but I reflect afterwards why I did & I'm left scratching my head. I think you have to open yourself to somewhat cheesy mythology and just go with it, then the movie rocks. That's half the appeal!

Usually I'm careful not to 'spoiler alert' in a review, but mostly it doesn't matter for Thor. The myths are like chess pieces they move around the board, and even if you know it doesn't affect the enjoyment. It's like knowing how a Bible story turns out but you still enjoy the telling of it.

Here's the insanely complicated Crisis / Climax, as far as I can make it out. Thor and Parker (the girl) escape Asgard and gain entry into the dark elvish dimension to attack Malakiths forces (I love it!). The implied crisis is that the king's sons Thor and Loki have no means of destroying the ether, which means Malakith need only acquire Parker and hell have dark matter. The conversion of the ether to dark matter can be achieved during a rare, brief, and imminent dimensional convergence. He will then be able to destroy not only Asgard, but this entire universe of energy and matter borne of light. So that's what Thor's facing, what his Crisis decision concerns.

On Earth a scientist has figured out this imminent convergence occurring in Earths vicinity and the threat it poses to space-time. As Thor and Loki do battle with Malakith and his forces, in which Loki apparently dies, the scientist and Parker place his convergence monitoring equipment 'just so' to irretrievably send the ether through into a far dimension. They succeed; it simultaneously sends Malakith and his forces to the same destination.

It's the rockin' sockin' devil-may-care action & reaction that makes the movie. Where the pieces go seems less important. Despite all this the movie has lots to say under the surface.

Ever notice how graphic novels can sometimes involve very sophisticated storytelling? This is like that.",1400544000,,1928,4.812688821752266

6083449,3,B00GLPCKX8,The plot idea was sort of doomed from the start when you make up an enemy that was not really from the Thor comic book - the dark elves really??? What I want to know is who said this was a good idea to begin with somebody namely the Director and or Producer should have said maybe we need to reread some of the older comics from the 70's or 80's and pick a better bad guy who was more interesting.  In the end still good as they have a great cast and lots of action and the best part is Loki working with Thor - I liked the move more after watching a few times and seeing the behind the sceens as to what they were trying to do with the story.,1400457600,3,643,3.8345864661654137

6083463,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Yes this movie is packed with a good story and more hammer smashing action. It picks up where the Avengers movie left off, in a different realm of course, with Loki imprisoned for his actions on earth and the rise of the dark elf ruler who is the new adversary to hit back at Asgard, Thor must face off with that faction. Natalie Portman plays a stronger role in this also and she is great. I believe that Thors hammer in this movie is twice the size as compared in the first movie. That's massive!",1400371200,,498,4.252631578947368

6083470,5,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed the first Thor movie ... this one topped it ... It offered an interesting story line (can't say that for a couple of the Avengers Movies) and was action packed.

6083476,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Why are they not showing this character the proper love he deserves? Out of all the Marvel movies, I felt Thor and Thor 2 have been the weakest links. The question is why though? He has a much richer back story and the mans a god! Yet for some reason he gets put in movies with:

* A weak story
* Lame supporting cast (besides Loki)
* Lazy writing
* stupid cliche's
* Sappy romance (I'm all for a love interest, but not this tripe)

I really hope for the 3rd movie, that they actually sit down and take their time with it and actually show this character some respect.",1400198400,2,568,4.154545454545454

6083478,3,B00GLPCKX8,"It's hard to write great movies. Thor and the Marvel Universe offer a spectacular, seemingly never-ending playground for incredible stories. Maybe that's part of the problem. It's too big of a subject. So where do you start and what do you do as a writer and or producer?
In this case, I didn't like the plot. I felt like I was watching one of the Hobbit movies with the dark elves. It's a been there, done that scenario that's been beaten to death.
 Hollywood wants screenwriters to follow a certain story arch, but what happens all too often is it becomes too formulaic and predictable, which equals boring.",1400198400,2,609,4.638888888888889
6083479,3,B00GLPCKX8,"It seems like they are really struggling to make a decent stand alone Thor movie.  It was okay, and had it's moments, but I found it rather dull and lack luster.",1400198400,,161,4.193548387096774
6083480,5,B00GLPCKX8,I was surprised to see Thor's mother killed in this one. I did not mourn the passing of Thor's brother Loki although the way he died was a nice twist. And then the surprise ending. Wow!! Can't wait for the next installment.,1400198400,,223,4.333333333333333
6083481,4,B00GLPCKX8,"There is just something so wildly exuberant about 'Thor: The Dark World'.  The plot sounds more complex than it is: thousands of years ago the Dark Elves tried to send all the realms of the universe into darkness with a force called The Aether, but their evil leader Malekith barely escapes with his own life when Asgardian soldiers manage to capture The Aether, hiding it away as it cannot be destroyed.  Flash-forward to present-day Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, who is actually kind of annoying in this film), angry at Thor for not keeping in contact in two years, who ends up a host for The Aether when she accidentally discovers it, bringing Malekith back to Asgard to retrieve the strongest weapon in the universe when Thor learns of what's happened and tries to protect her.  The battle scenes and special effects are HIGHLY ramped up here, in a fun, even funny and exciting film with Hemsworth and Hiddleston now fully grown into their respective roles as Thor and Loki.  Loved it!

6083496,4,B00GLPCKX8,just like the newer Star Wars movies i gave this movie a little extra lee way because it was THOR for goodness sake!  And Chris Hemsworth can do no wrong in my book.  It was worth seeing once for sure maybe even twice.,1400025600,,218,4.046511627906977

6083501,5,B00GLPCKX8,It's an awesome DVD pack and the movie rocks as much as Thor and Loki! The blu-ray is amazing. I just wish the didn't sell the packs bundled like this now. I don't have a 3D TV and don't care to have one.,1399939200,,204,3.7674418604651163
6083502,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Having read a lot of Thor comics in the 70's and 80's I appreciated the story and the visuals in Thor: The Dark World. The sets and cinematography was all done well. Acting was very good, especially Loki, which was a pleasant surprise. Some of the outfits looked way overdone, almost tacky, and that's where I had to really remind myself that they were inspired from comic book art and after all this is Asgard, right?  Special effect sounds were good but their volumes were mixed too much louder than the voice levels. That always bugs me. The worst thing though was the music score which was extremely unoriginal, unmemorable, standard (or substandard) fare thematic music. I didn't feel that the score went well at all with the movie and that it hurts the overall enjoyment of the total experience. That is why I can only give the three star score. . . I did like this movie way better than the first Thor movie.",1399939200,,915,4.545454545454546

6083505,5,B00GLPCKX8,A big fan of Hemsworth as Thor.  The sequel did not disappoint from the first Thor movie.  I recommend it for all those action watchers.,1399939200,,136,4.4
6083506,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I have never been a fan of Thor in the comics, so I wasn't interested in the movie.  Netflix was showing the first Thor and one night I decided to check it out (I like Anthony Hopkins who is in the film).  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  I thought Chris Hemsworth did a wonderful job and held his own next to Anthony Hopkins. Dream cast and director, Kenneth Branaugh, made the first Thor a quality film. Good, clean, family fun type movie. The romance is restricted to a kiss and looks of love, so no problem with the kids watching. thor: the Dark World, is filmed in England, so has quite a different feel to it. The Asgardians had a slightly different look about them, too. Less polished, more warrior appearing, so I thought wardrobe and hair definitely gave more unique (non shiny) look to the characters. Good action.  Also kudos to Tom Hiddleston who portrays the villain Lokie so well.  This 2nd installment I feel holds it's own and great fun for the family. TIP: Don't turn off the credits. There are 2 different teasers that come on AFTER the credits role for a bit, and the last at the very end of the film.",1399852800,,1111,4.426470588235294
6083507,3,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie was gorgeous, and the effects, cinematography and acting were all so fabulous that it distracts you from the fact that the plot is pretty darned thin.  Poor Christopher Eccelston was wasted on this version of Maleketh, struggling to act thru some made up language and makeup.  I enjoyed it a lot, especially the interaction between Thor and Loki, but I wish there had been a little more depth to the script.",1399852800,,418,4.712328767123288
6083508,5,B00GLPCKX8,This was a good continuation of the first Thor. Don't expect anything deep as it's a comic book movie - but for a comic book movie my wife and I really enjoyed it.

6083541,4,B00GLPCKX8,All the drama and special effects and action you would hope for.  And all that eye candy for male and female audience members.  A great diversion from the many action flicks that test the integrity of your ears.,1399420800,,211,4.526315789473684
6083542,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Really good story, great special effects, cant wait for next movie in series. I highly recommend this movie. Buy it.",1399420800,,116,4.85

6083544,5,B00GLPCKX8,It was very good and I'll watch it again. I would tell anyone to buy it. I'm glad they made # 2.,1399334400,,96,3.409090909090909

6083546,3,B00GLPCKX8,"mucho action, lots of flexed muscles, good ending, did not see that one coming, but should have. it's a set up for the next movie, but stands alone very well. if you like movies very loosely based on myth, this is for you. it's also a comic book, but i have never read those.",1399334400,,275,4.111111111111111
6083547,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The plot of the movie seemed little off at the start,  but over all the show was filled with action and the story became what you would expect from a hero movie.  I was impressed",1399334400,,178,4.057142857142857
6083548,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Pretty lame movie. Only a couple good parts. I wouldn't spend money for it!

And not enough substance like the last movie and not great story line too keep my interest",1399334400,,108,4.45
6083550,4,B00GLPCKX8,Very interesting plot. Special effects on point. Will see how the story will tie into the other marvel story lines.,1399334400,,115,4.8
6083551,4,B00GLPCKX8,This is a fun movie which I saw in the theater and wanted to own. The DVD was in good condition when I got it.,1399334400,,110,3.44
6083552,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I'm a big fan, had to have the 3-D version. Now I just need a bigger 3-d TV.  Always something...LOL",1399248000,,100,4.0
6083553,5,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed this movie because the 3d version gave me a sense that I was also there to fight evil.,1399248000,,96,3.85
6083554,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Continuing the second phase of Marvel's cinematic onslaught, begun several months prior with Iron Man 3, Thor's encore solo performance is a markedly stronger, more focused effort than his first. Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki. A fantastically imaginative flick, well-paced and triumphantly acted, that does something its precursor couldn't: whet my appetite for a sequel.",1399248000,,1358,5.350467289719626
6083555,4,B00GLPCKX8,It was good with a lot of action but the story line was not anything seen in the past.  I saw it once and enjoyed it but I wouldn't set it again.,1399248000,,145,3.53125
6083556,4,B00GLPCKX8,The special effects were really good. The scenery and props are very good. The story line was interesting. The acting was also good.,1399248000,,132,4.782608695652174
6083557,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I was hoping there would be a better back story for the dark elves. I hope Thor really lets loose in the next Marvel films .Can't wait for Avengers 2 , Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy of course !!!  I am Groooooooooot :)",1399248000,,224,4.090909090909091
6083558,5,B00GLPCKX8,Omg this is the best movie ever! Chris Hemsworth is just the ultimate actor for this part. Talk about totally fitting this part and doing a fantastic job. And Natalie Portman makes her role come to life as well. But this is the first time I have seen anything by Tom Hiddleston and he also did a fantastic job as Loki for sure. A must see movie! Of course I have viewed this movie 6 times already and I'm ready for more...,1399161600,,422,4.158536585365853
6083559,5,B00GLPCKX8,does an excellent job relating norse mythology  as well as marvel  comics major characters story lines written by Mr Stan Lee!,1399161600,,126,4.9523809523809526
6083560,4,B00GLPCKX8,It is really too bad it doesn't have the backup copy.  The movie is excellent entertainment.  Cast is very good.,1399161600,,112,4.55
6083561,5,B00GLPCKX8,Loved this movie! Watching it on blu ray always seems to make the movie more enjoyable. The movie came quickly and in perfect condition!,1399161600,,136,4.708333333333333
6083562,5,B00GLPCKX8,A really good movie.  Be sure to watch the first Thor movie before you watch this movie because this movie is not really a stand alone movie.,1399161600,,141,4.222222222222222
6083563,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Sir Anthony Hopkins had a larger part in the first addition of Thor, or just maybe better written or better directed. I'm not sure who did the screenplay or the directing of this one. Don't get me wrong it was entertaining but just didn't quite meet my expectations after seeing the 1st addition.",1399075200,,296,4.60377358490566
6083564,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I feel the characters are growing with the story as it develops, and felt keenly that I missed a couple of movies between the first Thor and this one.  I look forward to Marvel continuing to develop its library.",1399075200,,211,4.410256410256411
6083565,2,B00GLPCKX8,This is not my type of movie I guess.  We picked Tihis to watch as a family.  It didn't hold my interest and I found the story hard to follow.  I have watched and enjoyed other superhero movies in the past.,1399075200,,206,3.975609756097561
6083566,4,B00GLPCKX8,"It is much better than the first Thor movie. Here we have a mature Thor who realizes what he can do and why he should do it. Loki steals the movie of course. The digital extras were really interesting and it costs the same as the version without, so get this one. The movie looks great in Standard Def, so I didn't bother with paying more for the HD version.",1399075200,,358,4.128571428571429
6083567,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Good fun! Superhero / sci fi action packed movie about Thor's responsibilities to duty and to try and save the one he loves. Tounge and cheek humor thoughout. Interesting storyline. Some of the content may not be appropriate for very young children, but we enjoyed it.",1398988800,,268,4.8478260869565215
6083568,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Really enjoyed the first one, but this one was too busy with plot lines and spectacle.  Not enough on the character and plot development.",1398988800,,137,4.708333333333333
6083569,4,B00GLPCKX8,I like the first one a little better.  I hope that the next one will be much better.  You still need to see it if you want to keep up for the next one.,1398988800,,151,3.411764705882353
6083570,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Although I'm a comic book nerd, I've never been a fan of the Thor comic series.  It just hasn't grabbed me over the years, but I tend to stay away from sci-fi and fantasy, and Thor has always been rooted in that.

That being said, this movie is one of the best comic book movies I've seen since ""The Dark Knight.""  It's got a story I can follow (much better than the first), great performances and a ton of action.  And Loki... oh, Loki, I want to hate you but you're just so dang FUN!

Even a casual fan will find a lot to like here.  This is one of the greats!",1398988800,2,562,3.9732142857142856
6083571,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I enjoyed the first Thor movie, and this one is also good (but, to me, not better). It is one of those Marvels of dvd production.",1398988800,,129,4.0

6083575,5,B00GLPCKX8,"It's Marvel, It's Thor, I'm a nerd. Of course I gave it five stars. I'm hoping Jane isn't in the next one though, she's just kind of annoying. Me likey Sif! (not the syph though, TOTALLY different things)",1398988800,,204,4.394736842105263

6083577,4,B00GLPCKX8,"What can I say? It's Thor. Interesting twist yet somehow paled in originality or surprised from the first (and The Avengers, if that's a fair comparison. Actually it is because Iron Man III was very good compared the I, II and The Avengers). I enjoyed it very much.",1398902400,,265,4.541666666666667
6083578,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The saga continues and Thor is reunited with his lady love. The new enemy is daunting, some surprising and unexpected turns makes this action/romance exciting and not entirely predictable.  You have to be a Thor and Loki fan to really appreciate all of it. Chris got totally buffed for this one and gets to show it off. Great action scenes, great special effects, heroism, tragedy, romance, victory and all that! Highly recommended.",1398902400,,432,5.0
6083579,5,B00GLPCKX8,I absolutely loved this movie. The special effects were stunning. And then there is Loki. He is by far my FAVORITE marvel character. Marvel did a marvelous job. *wink*wink*,1398902400,,172,4.9655172413793105
6083580,1,B00GLPCKX8,I really didn't care for this movie at all. I was expecting it to be based on mid evil time. Not bouncing from modern time to mid evil time. To be honest with you could only tolerate 20 minutes of this movie. Then turned it off.,1398902400,,228,3.9782608695652173
6083581,5,B00GLPCKX8,Lot's of fun. Just like the comics but it's a movie. For those that desire the best escapism and fantasy.,1398902400,,105,4.3
6083582,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I am glad to see Natalie Portman back in this one.  I thought it was a good movie, but neither thor movie is really spectacular, they just fill in the holes before the Avengers movies.  But my girl friend loves this movie, i think she just loves Chris helmsworth ;)

The actions is good, the fighting is alright, the story is slightly lacking, but all in all its a fun ride.  No captain america 2 or avengers, but its a super hero movie.  If you like the marvel movies you'll like this one.

Again, its a fun ride!",1398902400,,514,4.1938775510204085
6083583,2,B00GLPCKX8,I didn't mind the first one but Tim Huddlestone as Loki is the only thing worth seeing this time out. The love affair between Jane and Thor does not ring true. On the whole a swing and a miss.,1398902400,,192,3.948717948717949

as was the entire story.  Look forward to next one",1398902400,,138,4.48
6083585,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This is a great continuation of Thor's story and his love for Jane, his parents and even his mischievous brother Loki, played exquisitely by Tom Hiddleston.  The movie takes place after the ""Avengers"" movie and within the same timeline as Iron Man 3. The dialog in this adaptation is quick and well delivered...especially the bantering between brothers Thor and Loki! A movie worth watching again and again and make part of the Avengers collection!",1398902400,,448,5.054054054054054
6083586,4,B00GLPCKX8,On par with the first one and with the general theme of fantasy hero's.  Good entertainment not requiring a great deal of thought and concentration to enjoy it which a good movie should do.,1398902400,,189,4.5588235294117645

6083588,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Somehow, a combination of things in this movie made it as enjoyable as the first.

6083589,2,B00GLPCKX8,"And there's zero chemistry between Thor and Jane. Jane is a completely useless character and it's an embarrassment that such a big name female star is relegated to playing such a weak role. Yeah, I know, Jane's supposedly a real smart PhD, but she never lives up to that characterization. Fortunately, in the comic book world, he ends up with Sif.",1398816000,,347,4.704918032786885

6083595,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I like Chris Hemsworth and most everyone in the cast.....I usually like what's her face, the lead love interest, but her character in this picture was supposed to be a scientiest and I just thought the way they did her character didn't really fit.

6083599,4,B00GLPCKX8,"A very good sequel with excellent character development for both Thor & especially Loki. The mix of science & magic gives the film great latitude with what can be done with the story. Of course, all of this is way beyond reality, but it is a very fun movie.

6083621,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Don't get me wrong.  I loved the first Thor and recognize that the Marvel movies on a whole are a cut above.  So what happened with ""The Dark World""?

In this cinematic installment we are treated to a more brooding thunder god as he concerns himself with Asgard and its politics.  Loki is being kept in the proverbial Asgardian gulag for his crimes against Asgard and humanity and here is a morose reflection of the trickster god presented in the first ""Thor"" and in ""The Avengers"".  But Earth is never far from Thor's mind, nor is his love Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has the stupidest of luck (or is it contrivance?) when she manages to uncover the Aether, an ancient source of incredible power.  The resuscitation of the Aether reawakens an old all but forgotten Asgardian enemy, the Dark Elves who seek the destruction of the universe by depriving it of its sources of light, and led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston; think Destro off of the first ""G.I. Joe"").  Malekith goes after the Aether, now inhabiting Jane Foster, and leads an improbable surprise attack on Asgard that leaves Thor to do battle in a space portal jumping sequence between Earth and another alien world.  Thor vanquishes his foe with Loki's help, with Loki's mind never far from the throne of Asgard.

There are big moments in T:TDW and I won't spoil them but they certainly have some far-reaching ramifications for the third film but...but for those who really enjoyed the first ""Thor"", especially interested in the family dynamics and enjoying the fish-out-of-water storyline, I think that they will find that there are paler shades of these elements in the sequel and that they aren't nearly as satisfying.  We get to see more of Asgard, more of the royal court, but this seems less Shakesperian (a strong suit with former director Branagh) in tone and simply heavier-handed in how it all plays out.  We get the fish-out-of-water element not with Thor on Earth for the first time but with Foster on Asgard for the first time but we don't get any satisfying sense of her wonder, or her being awestruck, that would make for her being the movie patron's eyes and ears to a new experience.  The visual tone of the film is dark, and a bit messy, which I suppose fits with the title of the movie but doesn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience.  And Tom Hiddleston's excellent portrayals of the god of mischief Loki are largely wasted (though I admit more dramatic) here.  There are punctuated places of humor but they are merely cheap laughs instead of deep and lasting smiles like the other Marvel movies have managed to supply.  At least they brought Kurse in but where was the big knock down drag out fight between he and Thor?  Their conflicts were all too brief.

I realize that I am complaining that Marvel didn't follow a formula that they've set up and I know that they need to try new things in order to keep a vitality, a freshness, and a willingness on the audience's part to keep coming back to characters that they're being asked to invest in.  It seems to me that Marvel tried to give us this in the tone of the movie while still following very similar plot structures to the first feature, and it falls somewhat flat.  I'm glad that they're trying.  I like these Asgardian characters and, quite honestly, I want to see more of them in Asgard and in the other nine realms and not so much adhering to Earth.

Oh.  And next time make Asgard glow like the golden city it is.",1398643200,4,3473,4.62214983713355

I could not stop thinking about how this happened, what now, etc.  I don't mind a little bit of a twist and leaving room for the sequel but this ending just came out of nowhere (at least for me) and I am still wasting brain-space thinking about what is going to happen next.  I guess it shouldn't have shocked me so much because it is similar to the ending in the first one, the moment that it happened though, it just wasn't what I was expecting.

2011s Thor obviously wasn't the first step towards the assembling of The Avengers; the groundwork for that had been laid years earlier with Iron Man and to a lesser extent The Incredible Hulk.  Thor did however make the premise of The Avengers feel a lot more tangible to moviegoers.  The rest, as they say, is history. Thor was followed by Captain American which was then followed by The Avengers.  As we wait for The Avengers 2, the cycle repeats and were treated to individual superhero films again, now up Thor: The Dark World.

The God of Thunder Thor must stop the Dark Elves, a dangerous and ancient race from obtaining the Aether, a substance capable of destroying Asgard, Earth and the rest of the universe.  With the help of Jane Foster and his treacherous brother Loki, Thor puts into action a daring plan to save the universe and banish the Elves forever.

Most of the cast of the original Thor returns.  The main exception being the minor role of Fandral; originally portrayed by Josh Dallas he was replaced by Chucks Zachary Levi.  Chris Hemsworth slips back into the role that made him a household name almost effortlessly and continues to be ferocious and charming.  Coming as no surprise Tom Hiddleston continues to be a scene stealer despite his character being ""locked up"" for most of the film.

Other Thor actors, namely Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgrd, Anthony Hopkins, Jamie Alexander and Ray Stevenson put in inspired performances even with their limited screen time. Natalie Portman's performance is a little harder to diagnose; reportedly she was unhappy when original director Patty Jenkins left the project and was contractually compelled to appear in the film.  Perhaps I'm reading too much into the reported dispute but I didn't feel she had as much enthusiasm for this project as the original.

While those appearing in front of the camera mostly stay the same the talent behind the scenes has changed dramatically.  Gone are writers Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Wayne and director Kenneth Branagh.  The writing staff consists of five writers; Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Don Payne, and Robert Rodat while the directing duties have fallen to Alan Taylor.  Mostly known for his TV work Taylor does have experience directing features but it's his background on the small screen that sets him up for success as he shows finesse in handling the film's more personal moments.

Finding the right balance between drama and humor can be a difficult tightrope to walk but for the most part Thor handles it quite well... up until the third act.  Then, at the most inopportune time some issues regarding the film's balance and tone start to derail The Dark World and rob it of its sense of urgency and danger.  It's not a deal breaking problem but it does hold the film back from having a truly memorable climax.

Thor: The Dark World has been given two Blu-ray releases; a standard 2D release and a 3D version which also includes the 2D version on a separate disc.  The 3D version also includes a digital copy.

The 2D presentation is flawless.  Black levels are inky, the color palette is vibrant (on Asgard especially) and flesh tones are natural and lifelike.  Detail consistently wows; everything from the fine stubble of Thors beard to minute costume textures are clearly visible.  I couldn't find a single negative quality to nitpick about the 2D transfer, its simply outstanding.

The 3D version of the film isn't quite as successful as its 2D counterpart.  Brightly lit scenes look fantastic; theres little to no crosstalk, colors still pop and theres very little drop off in terms of detail.  Much of the 3D effect doesnt always jump out of the screen, instead its used to create a greater sense of depth.  That may disappoint some viewers but I prefer 3D to be used like a scalpel and not an ax.  The transfer runs into some trouble during the numerous dark or dimly lit scenes.  The 3D effect just doesnt pop as much and you may find yourself struggling more to digest what you're looking at.  With that said, even at its worst The Dark Worlds 3D presentation is equal to or better than that of the first Thors 3D Blu-ray.

There should be no complaints about the well balanced and aggressive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track.  Dialogue is always crisp and intelligible, the surrounds provide plenty of ambient noise and when needed some appropriate directional effects, and Brian Tylers score is well balanced.  This is nothing short of what youd expect from one of Marvels signature cinematic properties.

Special features range from the mundane to the extraordinary.  The signature special feature is the Marvel One Shot: All Hail the King fourteen minute long short film starring Ben Kingsley from Iron Man 3.  It's a fun little companion piece that gives a little insight to one of the most intriguing side characters of the Marvel universe.  You'll also find a commentary with director Alan Taylor, cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, and actor Tom Hiddleston; the track is a bit dry but is informative.  The thirty-two minute long documentary A Brother's Journey: Thor & Loki explores the casting, performances, stories and relationship between the hero and villain.  Wrapping things up is a some short featurette about the Brian Tyler's score, eight minutes of deleted or extended scenes, a first look at Captain America: The Winter Soldier and a short gag reel.  Most of the extras are merely okay but the All Hail the King short improves the whole package.

The greatest thing that can be said about Thor: The Dark World is that it doesn't suffer from sequelitis like so many other sequels in recent years.  By avoiding the same fate of other recent sequels like Iron Man 2 and Star Trek: Into Darkness this film sets up the Thor franchise for continued success and keeps the Marvel movie machine moving full speed ahead.  The 2D & 3D transfers are top notch as is the DTS audio track, that in addition to the above average special features makes Thor: The Dark World an easy to recommend Blu-ray.",1398556800,,6842,4.964850615114235
6083631,5,B00GLPCKX8,I really do enjoy how these movies are done.  They are action filled and the good guys doesn't always win.  There are also so many surprised in them.  I would recommend this movie to anyone however I would suggest you watch the first one before watching this one.  It also helps to have seen the Avengers.  Marvel certainly knows how to intertwine their movies well to get the viewers to watch them all.  Not a problem for me since I really do want to see them all.,1398556800,,465,4.287356321839081

6083634,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I was dissappointed!

I'm still waiting for Marvel to get this character right.  He was beat down way too easily in this film, and he relies on his lightning powers way too early and easily.

Where's his helmet, he should wear it, especially during battle, and where's Baldar?

This just isn't the Mighty Thor, he's a God but he's just not powerful enough.  The Hulk no matter how strong is still only a man, so how can he beat Thor, a man just can't beat a God!

So far the best action sequence has been from the first Thor movie.  The beginning battle with the Frost Giants is still the best Thor movie moment.  C'mon Marvel you're doing fantastic with Captain America, how about giving us the hardcore serious (Thor should be like Gladiator and Troy, no comedy/humor) action packed adventure Thor should really be, still waiting!",1398470400,,832,4.612244897959184

6083682,4,B00GLPCKX8,"A must see...Great movie.....cannot wait for the next one. This was the best thor movie so far, the next one will be epic",1398124800,,121,4.304347826086956
6083683,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Between how great the first Thor film was and how epic this film's trailers were, my expectations for Thor 2 were very high. Unfortunately, the film definitely didn't reach those standards and disappointed me. It was still a good movie though.
The biggest problem with the film is the tone. Word is that there was a lot of fighting between the director and the studio over the film's tone. That's very evident here as the film's tone always seems to be all over the place. It's never really sure what it's going for.
This leads me to the film's second biggest problem which is that honestly, it feels like a product coming off an assembly line. The film has little creativity, probably due to the studio muting the director's voice a lot of the time and as a result, there is nothing that sets this film apart from the average big budget blockbuster. The Avengers was really elevated by Joss Whedon's creative vision as was Iron Man 3 with the creative vision of Shane Black. Without Alan Taylor getting much of a say, the film feels formulamatic and generic.
I felt like the film would have worked better without the human characters from the first film. Jane, Eric and Darcy were great characters in the first film, but in this film their really just back for the sake of being back. They slow the film down. The film would have moved faster and just rolled along better without them. To add insult to injury, Jane and Darcy are somewhat annoying a lot of the time. Darcy's comic relief, which worked really well in the first film, feels really forced here. Marvel probably feels that they need human characters to make the film relatable, but the story really could have gone on without them.(certain parts would have to be changed around, but still.) Hopefully after Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel will learn that as long as you make the supernatural characters compelling, they can stand on their own without having to be dragged down by ""relatable"" human characters. It's ironic because none of the human characters in this film are really relatable. They are all excessively cartoonish and wacky.
Lastly on my list of criticisms, the character development for the villains was terrible! Malekith has to be one of the worst villains of all time. There's nothing to him. He's just dark and serious and wants to destroy everything... why?! Same goes for his second in command.
On all other accounts, this is a good movie.
Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are once again very strong as Thor and Loki.
The action is fun!
The humor hits more times than not!
Marvel finally grows a pair of balls and kills off a protagonist, and doesn't bring them back.(Later in the film they kill off another protagonist but then bring them back five minutes later, so I guess old habits die hard. It's a start though.)
Also, the film ends with a very fun cliffhanger!
Thor: The Dark World is definitely not as good as most of the other Avengers/Avengers-related films, including the first Thor film, but it's definitely still an enjoyable movie!",1398124800,,3034,4.715630885122411

6083697,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Another plodding study in how decent VFX is no substitute for character or story. While it feels more genuinely ""superheroic"" than the first Thor film, at no point does one particularly care why any of these characters are doing the things they do (Hiddleston seems to give it a spirited go, but there's simply not much for him to work with). The plot doesn't offend so much as, say, that of ""Man of Steel,"" but neither is it remotely engaging (nor does it do much to explore or expand on the lore of the Thor comics). Production quality is high--imaginative sets, some interesting space ships, and well-realized costumes (though I'm still at a loss to explain the refusal to give Hemsworth a helmet, the one that appeared briefly in the first film having looked quite all right). But even the greatest spectacles aren't all that spectacular anymore, and this one's is only enough to earn it a second star. Marvel just doesn't seem to know what to do with poor Thor outside of an Avengers film, and here he seems to be idly treading tepid Asgardian water until ""The Age of Ultron"" rolls around.",1398038400,3,1094,4.644329896907217

I was expecting more of the same from this movie, but it actually gave me the same kind of feeling I get watching original Star Wars trilogy. Yeah, I said it. I actually sat on the couch and was glued to the tv, which is a rare thing for me. It has awesome sci fi scenes, fights are pretty cool and a bit creative, story is pretty cool.

Strap on and enjoy the ride. The effects were as good as on Cosmos on tv right now. The Hammer has a lot of great scenes of it's own I would say. In the fact how it can return to him from any where. Any more and I'd give things away.

6083722,3,B00GLPCKX8,"After seeing Captain America: The Winter Soldier I had high hopes that this sequel would also be a significant improvement upon the original. Sadly this was not the case. It's still just a really wonky movie with tons of underdeveloped characters and scenes that were clearly intended to have some kind of emotional impact but fail because those characters and their interpersonal relationships with each other were barely present. The sci-fi and fantasy isn't blended together or explained well and the scenes are stitched together like a patchwork quilt. They don't flow at all, they feel like you're watching about four different movies at once, and no one element really feels complete. There are parts of it that are really good, enjoyable, and funny, but as a whole it's kind of a clusterf*ck. Even when it's being good it's still kind of bad. Frigga's funeral is done really well, it's beautiful and creative and shows how beloved and respected she was, but it has no impact on the audience because we barely knew her and barely saw anyone interact with her so the tragedy doesn't really hit home. Then, to make matters worse, Loki, whose character and interpersonal relationships HAVE been developed, appears to die and barely a couple of minutes pass and the tone's already shifted to comedy, and then the movie betrays it's own pathos even further when a couple of hours tops after the fact a character makes an insensitive comment about Loki to a presumably still grieving Thor, and it's played for laughs. It's like they were trying to capture the magic of the ""he's adopted"" line from The Avengers, but that just wasn't the time or place for a joke like that. The worst part is the main conflict of the story. I don't know who the dark elves are. I don't really remember the bad guy's name. I have no idea why he wanted to do what he did or how the Maguffin that pretty much only exists so we have an excuse to involve Natalie Portman was supposed to work. Then there's the final battle. Really creative concept with the teleportation aspects, and I could handle a little bit of the comedy, but stuff like Thor boarding a train when he could've just flown back to the battle site break the tension by removing the sense of urgency.
Bottom line, this movie is pretty shoddy on a technical level but it's not really offensively bad, unless maybe you have a problem with Frigga dying or Odin being kind of a tool. But it's no Batman and Robin or Spiderman 3. It's not painful to sit through and it doesn't derail or humiliate your favorite characters, it's just not put together well.
I can't say for sure if this is or isn't necessary viewing like the original was for The Avengers, but my guess is that you could get away with watching the final scene and the first post-credits stinger and be all set for The Avengers 2.",1397952000,3,2833,4.623015873015873

6083757,3,B00GLPCKX8,This was just OK. I like Marvel movies but this one was just OK.  Not giving too much away but the ending was weird even for this type of movie. Bits of comedy were well placed but the plot was not that impressive.,1397692800,,214,3.9767441860465116

6083765,2,B00GLPCKX8,"First of all, I don't have a 3D TV. Most people that I know don't either. In fact, only 2 people I know have a 3D TV. So for whatever reason Thor: The Dark World was released in the 3D-blu-ray + Blu-ray format with no availability of my favored Blu-ray + DVD format and I think this stinks. Historically, I like to buy the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD to have a movie in 2 usable formats. Whoever decides these things should take another look at why this is - because this consumer will not be purchasing movies that are released in unplayable formats. Interestingly, Catching Fire was also released in the same 3D format only. Hopefully, this isn't a trend.",1397606400,,656,4.385245901639344

6083769,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Ok we have a big blond dude with massive picks walking around with a hammer knocking the crap out of everything, even 20 ft tall stone man.  Making smart ass commits like, ""I accept your surrender.""  Then you have the sultry young vixen who is totally head over heals for this man among men.  Add to this there is lots of destruction in London and other places including Asgard.  The only thing missing is a little gratuitous sex, but then it would lose the GP rating.  Isn't it funny you can pound the crap out of the bad guy, destroy buildings, and kill thousands but let him kiss his girlfriend who is walking around with the look of ""Please jump me, I want it."" and suddenly it is not GP.  Never mind.
This is a fun movie, it is a guy flick, girls will watch it only because their man boy wants to.  But it is fun and has some interesting characters.",1397606400,,854,4.234567901234568

6083774,5,B00GLPCKX8,As a sequel I have to say it was just as good as the first movie.  Marvel always does it right,1397520000,,94,3.4761904761904763
6083775,4,B00GLPCKX8,"When all these Avengers-oriented movies began coming out a few years ago, I was less than excited about Thor. Never quite 'got' him back when I collected 'silver age' Marvel comics and watching Marvel Super Heroes after school on WGN-- and I had no idea how they were going to make him interesting.
Was I wrong!
This Thor is complex without being plodding. He has a sense of humor, a strong sense of morality, and a big Achilles heel of being just a bit of a sucker for Loki's deception (and others).
Thor II has all the comic elements plus a lot of the better parts of sword and sorcery flicks. Special effects are outstanding and the performances are right on.",1397520000,,662,4.479338842975206
6083776,5,B00GLPCKX8,"If you read Marvel Comics and liked the first Thor film and the Avengers then you must add this to your collection! It has all the characteristics that made Marvel Comics #1 beginning in the early '60s as Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and others created a new pantheon of stories that had great action, humor, and wonderful plotting. Heroes--even gods--had problems and issues. They were capable of great deeds and yet their feet had some clay on them too. I'm so pleased that Stan Lee is still alive to see his creations come to life on the movie screens of the 21st Century because truly the technology to do them justice literally took 50+ years. That proves that Stan is a visionary and genius--God bless you Stan for all the wonderful hours of reading and imagination I have had throughout my life since I was about 4 years old. Carpe Diem!",1397520000,,836,4.543046357615894
6083777,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Okay Thor plus Loki - even better.  Fast paced with enough action to keep the hubs and the kid entertained too.  I loved the gravity defying effects.  Don't know how scientifically plausable they are, but it was very cool.",1397520000,,222,4.641025641025641

6083782,4,B00GLPCKX8,The first thor movie started off with some action but by the time he went to earth it became mostly talk. Thor the dark world however has way more action in it and the story is much better. Can't wait for thor 3,1397520000,,211,3.9302325581395348

At first my wife wasn't sure about it, but when we went to see the ""Avengers,"" she wanted more, and got into the other movies since they all fit together to make Phase 1 of the universe, and we have contiued to get into the rest of the movies. Thor 2 was a really good movie, it added even more depth to the characters in this movie as well as the whole universe.",1397520000,,437,4.152941176470589

However, we were quite unhappy to learn that we could not purchase a Blu-ray/DVD/UV copy...We would pay a premium for the grouping, but instead will pick a single copy version (we bought the blu-ray locally) and that's all we'll be buying. Great movie though!",1397433600,,323,4.785714285714286

6083786,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I've been reading Thor since my youth (when comics were still a dime).
While there's been some ""creative"" license taken, still a good job putting him up on the big screen.
Visuals are excellent in my opinion, even better in 3D - but I'd still like to know how come he never wears his helmet...
This could've been taken out of any of his comics, panel by panel.
I think Chris Hemsworth owns this character, rightfully so.

Get it, watch it, you'll like it.

I was a fan of the first installment, and even didn't mind the Avengers, but this was utter nonsense. I still can't figure out how/why they won in the end...

My 8 year old son and I watched this movie at home on Amazon rental HD 1080P together and had a blast, and that's really all that matters. The video and sound quality on Amazon Instant Video was close to Blu-ray, but NOT. It was 720P at best and not 1080P, and I have very Hi speed internet so it should have been 1080P HD as advertised on Amazon Instant Video. Enough said, right? Renting on Amazon was good enough to entertain my son and I on a sleepy Sunday afternoon and that is what counts! I didn't by the Blu-ray combo because it was just a Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray and digital combo, but no DVD. What's up with that, because my son and I both still have devices that are still only DVD, like the entertainment system in my 2008 Honda Odyssey.

This one blends worlds effectively, keeping the tone and action seamless throughout.  The acting is much improved, the pacing is excellent, the villain is entertaining, and Loki as usual steals the show.  It's also rather fun to see Natalie Portman all grown up!  It makes one look forward to the next in the series.",1397347200,,456,4.65

6083827,5,B00GLPCKX8,Watched through Amazon streaming as a prime member and we fell in love with this series of Movies.  We saw the second movie which was just as good as this one.  Not boring in any aspect of the entire movie.  I would highly recommend.  Great special effects.,1397260800,,257,4.404255319148936
6083828,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor is ""The Hammer""!  Loki is "" The Weazel!""!  Good action movie and continues the Marvel Universe expansion!  Thanks Stan Lee for creating these great characters!",1397260800,,164,5.230769230769231
6083829,3,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed this second installment of the Thor series. The story was quite interesting and the action and special effects were good.,1397174400,,131,5.0
6083830,5,B00GLPCKX8,Even though it was close too 3 hours it took me to another world and that's what I look for in a movie.,1397174400,,103,3.5217391304347827

6083834,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor the movie was good. I thought it could have been much better. Thor and Jane Foster was NOT a match. Also, she couldn't really act which kinda destroyed the movie.",1397174400,,167,4.419354838709677

6083836,5,B00GLPCKX8,Much better than the first movie. If you've ever read the comics you should really enjoy the dark world. Hopefully the next one is as good.,1397174400,,139,4.384615384615385
6083837,5,B00GLPCKX8,"A continuation of the first Thor movie.  I would say this is as good if not better than the first movie.  The plot has more than on story line, so the movie is not a simplistic brain dead movie for stupid people.  Action scenes are countered by romantic moments and stormy relationship between Thor and his brother.",1397174400,,315,4.491228070175438
6083838,4,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed the film and how it moved his story further. My only annoyance is the rewriting of history around the infinity stones.,1397174400,,128,4.608695652173913
6083839,5,B00GLPCKX8,u have 2 see this film simply because the action is out of control ppl! story was good but not great. 1st film had the story.but the evil bad guy&his bodyguard were awesome! hmm....thor3??hee-hee,1397088000,,195,4.764705882352941

6083841,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I don't get why some people thought it was not good. in my opinion, people can be a little too judgmental and set the standards for sequels impossibly high to the point where a movie can't possibly reach it.  This movie was very well directed, well acted, well written, shot wonderfully and was grander than its predecessor.  While I love the first Thor, I love the scope of this one, and the way loki was portrayed in this one.  My only problem with the movie was that he was not in it enough, because he is electric on camera.  I'm sorry, but for those who did not say this was a good film, are to me those people who are looking for negatives and so they have no choice but to find them.  This movie was spectacular and beautifully directed.",1397088000,,744,4.285714285714286
6083842,5,B00GLPCKX8,"We really enjoyed this second installment of the Thor movies the way it left off I have no doubt that their will be a number three, they can not leave our hero and the woman he loves apart and unwed. Also Loki has partially redeemed him self in this second movie after the first Thor and then the Avengers he was sentenced to life in prison with no contact with his adoptive mother and farther he is destined to spend the remaining years of his life alone isolated and hated but in a dramatic turn of events he has the chance to prove that he is not pure evil and totally heartless. I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as our family did.",1397088000,,641,4.136
6083843,5,B00GLPCKX8,Great action flick. One of the best 3D movies on the market. The special effects were phenomenal. Held my interest through out the film.,1397088000,,136,4.708333333333333

6083847,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I can not say enough on this action packed movie. I loved the first and the second was just a great. I was sitting on the edge watching the movie tell us this untold story. Love all the action with the dark invasion and good prevailing evil. Can't wait to see the next part as the story continues. This was such a surprise and had me feeling desired to watch more right then and there at that very moment.

Then that's exactly what surprised us next seeing some of the up coming pre-tale to what is to come. Can't wait to see it even more!",1397088000,,539,4.133333333333334
6083848,5,B00GLPCKX8,Thor: The Dark World ranked right up there with the Avengers for our family. The action and plot held the interest of our 13 and 15 year old boys. Marvel really knows how to pack the action in and keep it's audience gripped!,1397088000,,224,4.232558139534884

6083854,4,B00GLPCKX8,The graphics makes me believe that London was in danger of being destroyed by the alien invaders. More of a dynamic relationship between brothers. Looks more like siblings having problems with each other . That doctor Phil can resolve . You can see a softer side of Thor's brother . That proves that theirs a glimmer of hope but......nope greed over ride it . Loki will be Loki . Lol,1397088000,,383,4.485714285714286

I'd give it a perfect rating, other than some things that would be a total spoiler, and I don't like to spoil!  For sure one to watch again.  Really enjoyable, and plays to all ones emotions!",1397088000,,301,4.321428571428571

6083861,2,B00GLPCKX8,"The world is beautifully crafted. There are moments of awesomeness. However, it was very hard to take this movie seriously. Comedy placed in every scene it seemed. Scenes that were to me taken as heart wrenching are followed by corny cheese jokes. At the very end of the credits, literally found myself saying ""are you for real?"" Come on Avengers...",1397088000,,349,4.833333333333333

The length of the movie on my 60"" is narrow, which from a visual perspective can be annoying.  I'm still rooting for Amazon though.  I'm a loyal customer and I do hope they see this post, and do something about the quality of their HD instant movies.

The movie though is a classic.",1397001600,,455,4.317647058823529

6083867,5,B00GLPCKX8,"What I like about this movie, and the others in the Marvel universe, is that the characters are complex and continue to develop as time goes on. The relationship between Thor and Loki is what I find most compelling about the Thor movies, and the character of Loki in particular is a fascinating one to watch. You never know what he's going to do. It isn't any wonder there is such a huge fan base for the character (and also for Tom Hiddleston, the actor who portrays him). The CGI is, of course, fantastic,as it has been in every Marvel movie I have seen so far. It moves along at a fast pace and keeps your attention; it never gets boring. This, along with The Avengers, is a movie I can easily watch over and over. Great fun!",1397001600,,728,4.282608695652174

I think trying to connect all the Marvel movies might be taking a toll on the franchise.  It makes me concerned for the new movies that are due to come out--Guardians of the Galaxy and the movie on Ant Man with Paul Rudd--might fall under the same fate. And Natalie Portman, although in other movies she shines, she's just simply annoying in this one.",1397001600,,467,4.235955056179775

6083877,3,B00GLPCKX8,"A huge superhero fan boy here and I'd like to say this movie was kind of a big let down. Thor seemed to be lacking in the entertainment department. That's what makes these superhero movies so great to watch. This movie lacked hammers to the face, epic battles, thor's one liners, and all of the fun from the first one. If I could do it all over again I would probably wait till it lowers in price or is just free. I would've much rather watched the first Thor again. That one was awesome.",1397001600,,488,4.202127659574468

6083884,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This was a great follow up to the first Thor! More action, a better story and of course, MORE Loki! Everything plays off of ""The Avengers"" movie and just like Iron Man 3 and soon ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" it was a good continuation story. I think the directors used more of Thor's image that made him so popular in the comics......like using his hammer more, showing the different properties of the hammer, getting his partners of Sif, Baldir, Fandral and the rest more involved and showing his Mother in action. This ""Thor"" had a lot more to offer and was even better than the first Thor to me. I can't wait to see more of the movies that come from Marvel and keep the Marvel Universe going! Excellent Blu Ray DVD as well!",1396915200,,731,4.462686567164179

It has a little of bit of something for everyone: action, humor, love, and tragedy. I personally feel that the Thor movies have thus far been the best stand-alone films from the Marvel/Avengers franchise. And the cast is simply fantastic...there are so many wonderful actors/actresses, but I have to recognize Anthony Hopkins, Rene Russo, and Tom Hiddleston for being outstanding in supporting roles. The soundtrack and special effects are awesome as well. In short, this a fun (and not too serious, albeit a bit darker than the original Thor film) movie that I enjoy watching every time. I highly recommend this movie for anyone that is a fan of Marvel superheros inspired by the comics.",1396915200,,826,4.9

6083888,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Loved the DVD/Blu showing of the film as well.  My only complaint is Disney/Marvel breaking up the E-copy version of the film and including that with the 3D version.  This double and triple dipping of movie versions really needs to stop.

6083897,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The critics complained about the first Thor movie because of the limited scope of the plot involving an insignificant blot on the map. This one concerns the destruction of the entire Universe and still the critics complained.

Anthony Hopkins seemed to be alluding to his Hannibal Lector role when he likened Miss Porter to a goat at a banquet which I thought a strange metaphor.

Bifrost is back with no explanation so the Asgard Morlocks/Umpa Lumpas must have accrued quite a bit of OT getting things back in shape for this sequel. I suppose we will need the Director's cut to find out how all this happened.

6083903,5,B00GLPCKX8,This was well worth every penny. The movie is well done...although the chemistry between Portman and Hemsworth seems to be lacking...but that is my only complaint.,1396828800,,163,5.3076923076923075
6083904,5,B00GLPCKX8,"MOVIE WAS VERY INTERESTING FROM START TO FINISHED  AND I RECOMMED THIS MOVIE IT WAS AWESOME, GREAT FANTASTIC YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT !!!",1396828800,,133,4.541666666666667
6083905,3,B00GLPCKX8,"parts of this were quite good, but overall, i found it strangely flat. I have enjoyed most of these comic book movies, so it isn't a dislike of the genre. I don't know if it is just that there is no depth to Thor, or that Loki so effortlessly outshines him. the villian was especially well cast, and should have had a bit more backstory and screen time. not a complete waste of time, but i was underwhelmed.",1396828800,,407,4.230769230769231
6083906,1,B00GLPCKX8,really really bad movie.  reminded me of the HULK movies.  hoped for better.  Loki was the only good part of the movie.  not worth the time,1396828800,,139,4.230769230769231
6083907,5,B00GLPCKX8,Kept my interest the whole movie. My favorite of all the Marvel Comic Characters to come to the big screen. What more can you ask?,1396828800,,130,4.24
6083908,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I think this is a great sequel, lots of action, romance and funny things. Loky is back so this makes the movie even better.",1396828800,,123,4.166666666666667
6083909,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I was really looking forward to this installment in the Marvel universe and was fairly disappointed. There were a number of plot holes, poor character development and a generally confusing story. Loki, who could be one of the coolest villains is reduced to his standard bait and switch trick. Apparently, as he asked in ""The Avenger"", Thor always will fall for his tricks.",1396828800,,372,4.920634920634921
6083910,4,B00GLPCKX8,"We enjoyed this movie.  The plot is creative and there was some good acting in the movie with good bits of humor.  As always the special effects were spectacular and they filled in some fun cameos from other Marvel superheros.  I do not recommend the movie, however, if you haven't seen the first Thor movie as it seemed that there were a lot of details that it was assumed you already knew.  So, make sure to watch the first move before watching this one.",1396828800,,456,4.392857142857143
6083911,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Hemsworth and Portman have no charisma or chemistry, just as in the first movie, and now they've added a totally flattened Christopher Eccleston to the mix -- what a waste of his talent. Hiddleston is still fun as Loki, but the guy can't carry the whole franchise on his skinny shoulders.",1396828800,,288,4.666666666666667
6083912,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Liked the action but the storyline was implausible. Example: Whenever s threatening person attempted to touch Jane Foster, they were blown away from her but not when Loki grabbed her.",1396828800,,183,5.133333333333334
6083913,4,B00GLPCKX8,Witty and Action Packed.  The story had a nice twist at the end. Stick around for both easter eggs. Overall it's worth watching.,1396828800,,128,4.565217391304348
6083914,5,B00GLPCKX8,Great movie. Action packed with a good plot. I am bias toward superhero movies but this one i would watch again,1396828800,,111,4.333333333333333
6083915,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I was a huge Thor comic fan when I was young. The first movie was kind of 'eh' in my opinion, but I enjoyed this one much more. The guy who plays Loki really does a good job in his part. Am on the go and not much time to look up names and all that at the moment. Anyway, I really enjoyed it. There was a lot of action and a better story line than the first movie in my opinion. I actually skipped seeing it at the theater because I was lukewarm about it, but now wish I had so I could have seen it on the big screen.",1396828800,,516,3.6576576576576576
6083916,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Hooboy, this was terrible.  Liked the first one and generally believe they have done a really good job with the marvel/avengers universe movies but this one flat out stunk.  Felt like a practical joke.",1396828800,7,201,4.882352941176471
6083917,2,B00GLPCKX8,plot was too busy - didn't really hang together. Got bored after a while. Even special effects couldn't keep the move together after a while.,1396828800,,141,4.68
6083918,5,B00GLPCKX8,I love all the marvel comic movies and Thor:The Dark World was another great addition. I'm hoping they will make another movie,1396828800,,126,4.7727272727272725
6083919,3,B00GLPCKX8,Movie was okay. Not as good as Iron Man but it was okay. Did not watch first movie and was still able to catch on with the thing about Loki.,1396828800,,140,3.7
6083920,5,B00GLPCKX8,I loved this movie.  It was full of action & suspense.  If you like Chris Hemsworth you will like this movie.,1396828800,,109,4.142857142857143
6083921,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Great movie! I thought this one was better than the first Thor movie, and I would highly recommend this it!",1396828800,,107,4.4
6083922,4,B00GLPCKX8,Expanded on the original movie well. Had plenty of action and a little humor. Not bad at all in my book.,1396742400,,104,4.0
6083923,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I liked it a lot !!!  I cannot wait for the next Mattel movies in the upcoming years.
Thank you",1396742400,,95,3.75
6083924,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Loki RULES! Excellent movie.  Thor's grown-up - sort of.  Jane is bored, totally sick of waiting around for her boyfriend to be back and seems to sleep through much of it.  Loki totally owns the movie with witty comments and action that really outclasses big brother.  I mean, Thor has his hammer but Loki slaughters a whole bunch of dark elf baddies with a KNIFE!!???  Plus he saves Jane from being sucked into a mini-black hole AND saves his brother's ass.",1396742400,,458,4.604938271604938
6083925,5,B00GLPCKX8,It was excellent.  The ending of the movie was a unexpected.  I was surprised by the ending of the movie. I thought Loki was dead. Now he turns up alive.  I wondered what happened to the real king.,1396742400,,197,4.131578947368421
6083926,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman return as the GOD of thunder and his human love Jane Foster. This time he most save the nine realms from the return of the dark elves and there desire to return all to darkness. but two question remain, what did Loki do with Odin? and where are the other three infinity stones?",1396742400,,313,4.413793103448276
6083927,5,B00GLPCKX8,its very good I would recommended this movie to my mother and sister my sister friends and their families churches,1396742400,,114,4.75

6083929,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I bought this for my husband who loves 3D movies.  We were both equally impressed by the 3D cinema, the story line with its cliff-hanger and the overall movie itself. It is something else to watch this caliber of film in 3D.  People should check this out!",1396742400,,255,4.404255319148936
6083930,5,B00GLPCKX8,If you're a Marvel fan or just like good movies then get this on Blu-ray-it's fantastic! Already watched it four times!,1396742400,,119,4.714285714285714
6083931,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I watch movies for entertainment and to enjoy them with family and friends. This movie was fast action and continuous fun. The special effects were well done and like I said the continuous action and fight scenes were spectacular.

This type of film takes me back to my childhood of reading comic books and loving Marvel comics. Thor was always one of my heroes and Loki hasn't changed a bit. I liked this film for entertainment and I rate it as a 5 star film for that reason alone. If you are not a fan of Thor or of marvel comics you may not like the film but I enjoyed it.",1396742400,,575,4.18018018018018
6083932,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I am a fan of Chris Hemsworth he is a great actor. I watch the first Thor he made and loved it. Then when the second one came out I was thrilled couldn't wait to see it . I was not disappointed it was exciting from the beginning to the end.
The movie is very easy to follow you want be confused.

I am planning on purchasing both movies for my home collection.",1396742400,,360,3.9315068493150687

I hope you enjoy like i did.",1396742400,,107,3.6956521739130435
6083934,5,B00GLPCKX8,Excellent movie and the 3D option is amazing with the expanded detail during the many action scenes throughout the entire movie.,1396742400,,128,5.142857142857143
6083935,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie was great in 2D, but after viewing it at home in 3D I was so surprised at the eye popping effects jumping off my screen. I have since purchased two additional 3D movies.",1396742400,,180,4.171428571428572
6083936,2,B00GLPCKX8,Liked the original Thor movie. But I could only vaguely follow the plot of this one. Maybe if I followed Thor comics it would have made more sense.,1396742400,,147,4.285714285714286
6083937,3,B00GLPCKX8,Could have been much better. Found it boring and it was lacingk of creativity.  Marvel could do better with Thor,1396742400,,112,4.6
6083938,5,B00GLPCKX8,Great sequel!  Great addition to the marvel family. Left it way open for a third or maybe even a lead in to the avengers.,1396742400,,121,4.041666666666667
6083939,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Like I said, a good movie at a decent price. The digital HD allowed me to access it via Vudu so I can watch it anytime anywhere.",1396656000,,128,3.7777777777777777
6083940,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I really liked the first Thor movie, but compared to Captain America and the Iron man Trilogy I felt like it came up a little short. This one contributed so much more to the mythos of Thor in the movies and I look forward to the continued antics of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and now the over-arcing story they teased in the end credits. Marvel is on fire right now with all of these incredible movies!",1396656000,,397,4.306666666666667
6083941,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I really enjoyed the whole movie. I found my self hoping Loki could be won over.  Even sad when he ....  Until I shows up on the throne.  Can't wait til the next one comes out.  Great characters and always glad to see them appear in shows like shield, Iron Man and etc.  Would definitely watch it again.",1396656000,,303,4.155172413793103
6083942,5,B00GLPCKX8,Liked the original better. But love these type of action movies. Marvel is making a lot of money bringing their comic book action hero to the film industry.,1396656000,,156,4.607142857142857
6083943,5,B00GLPCKX8,I purchased the blu-ray with digital copy. We need digital copies because we travel. My digital purchases can be uploaded through my Prime account onto my Kindle. Great!,1396656000,,169,5.071428571428571
6083944,4,B00GLPCKX8,I rated this a 4 because when we went to use it the movie kept freezing. When we took out the dvd was wet with something as we are not sure with what. We has to get a soft cloth to wipe down. Once that was done it was all set. Movie was awesome.,1396656000,,245,3.5555555555555554
6083945,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The action was great and character profiles were well developed. I truly enjoyed the movie, watched it with my grandson. We have the first one also, and that one was better, but the first always is, still think this one is great. If you enjoyed that first, you will like the way they continued the series. The sound and video quality is terrific.",1396656000,,346,4.507936507936508
6083946,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor is it. Better than the 1st one. Best of the group so far.
But than again each movie of marvel seems to out do the next one.
Wanted a blu ray, dvd combo but this was it.",1396656000,,173,3.5789473684210527

6083949,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I missed Thor when it was released in movie theaters. I really did not think I would enjoy it enough to pay for admission. When it hit Redbox we rented it and I was blown away. The first Thor was my favorite Marvel movie until the Avengers, but now Thor: The Dark World has taken that spot. It had everything that I hoped it would in story and adventure.

For you Ironman fans (especially those who fuss over Ironman 3) you have got to see the Marvel short ""All Hail the King"" to see how events unfold for poor Trevor aka ""The Mandarin.""

If you are collecting the Marvel Cinematic Universe you will probably pick this up anyway, if not and looking for a fun tale of good vs. evil, you have got to grab Thor: The Dark World.",1396656000,,724,4.201438848920863

6083952,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I found the first one enjoyable, not bad but enjoyable.  And with the second one I got the same reaction.  Lots of action but thin on substance.  I had some laugh out loud moments so I guess that where it counts.",1396656000,,212,4.121951219512195

6083957,3,B00GLPCKX8,"OK this should be 2 and a half stars, and at the end of the day it was a weak story like and poor direction that did this film in. Sorry to say Marvel you dropped the hammer on this one, and I'm a huge Chris Hemsworth fan and I had to put that to the side, but at least me made up for it 10 fold in RUSH and you can see the difference that great direction makes.",1396656000,,362,3.5949367088607596

6083960,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Definitely enjoyed the comics & good to see on film, but not my favorite character from the Marvel Universe. The whole Norse Mythology they have to (inherently) weave into the plot-line gets a bit hokey for me, but that's just me. If you like the Marvel Superhero genre going in, not a bad movie.",1396569600,,296,4.5
6083961,2,B00GLPCKX8,"The plot was pretty disappointing in this Thor movie. Portman's character and Thor have no chemistry at all. The very best part of the Thor movies is Loki, and they didn't have enough of his character in this one. Tom Hiddleston's talent was wasted. Had they added 30 more minutes of Loki story line and 20 less minutes of boring, redundant action scenes, and it could have been at least a 4 star movie. The first one was better, as was the Avengers with Loki.",1396569600,5,460,4.423529411764706
6083962,3,B00GLPCKX8,the movie was cute...action was pretty cool... main character is a hotty. Love idris... I'll still see the 3rd one,1396569600,,114,4.75
6083963,5,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed the first one. I really enjoyed this movie. This is one of the rare times when the sequel is as good if not better than the first one.,1396569600,,144,3.8333333333333335

6083967,5,B00GLPCKX8,Thor has been one of my favorite Marvel characters from childhood [I was reading comics when they were 15 cents so that gives you an idea how old I am].  They've done well in bringing the Asgardian to life.,1396569600,,206,4.282051282051282

6083969,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I am a huge fan of superheroes and Thor is one of my favorite. The sequel to Thor is bigger, louder and slightly better than the first. Alan Taylor directs this visceral sequel to Thor and changes the feel set by director kenneth Branagh in the first film. This one is mainly set off earth but carries enough humor and tricks when it comes to earth.

Chris Hemsworth is stoic and muscular to be a totally credible Nordic god, Thor. Tom Hiddleston is wily and sneaky as Loki, his adopted brother.  While Loki and Thor are now natural enemies,a threat from the past, the Dark Elves return in space ships to destroy Asgard. Along the way, there is the budding love between Thor and Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the redemption of Loki,  the death of a member of the royal house of Odin, and the and the emotional ramblings of Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard but the main attraction here is the battle with the dark Elves who are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his weapon of destruction, the Aether.

This is a fun and eye=popping action film for superhero movie fans.",1396569600,,1085,4.577319587628866
6083970,5,B00GLPCKX8,Clearly kept my attention going!  Now how soon for the next series and who is who?!! I can only say so much the killing of mother.,1396569600,,130,4.0
6083971,2,B00GLPCKX8,I like the movie but would have rather watched it in guilty screen than letter box. 3D movies are better viewed in full screen. I don't recommend purchasing the letter box version but if they do have a full screen version I do highly recommend it.,1396569600,,247,4.391304347826087

6083977,3,B00GLPCKX8,"As is usually the case the sequel doesn't live up to the first.  This felt more like an episode of the tv show thor than a movie.  My favorite part in the film is when loki shapeshifts to different characters, but that only happens for a few seconds.  I agree with the reviewer that compared the dark elves to ""star trek characters"" the way they were portrayed.  Eccleston is a great actor, but he is suffocated under all this costuming and makeup so we don't really get to see him shine- making him a boring villian.  Not impressed.",1396569600,,533,4.3979591836734695

6083980,4,B00GLPCKX8,I was never a fan of Thor during my comic book days.  But I have to admit that the movies by Disney are fun to watch.  The Dark World is a great continuation from the 1st Thor and plays off of The Avengers.  Can't wait for the 3rd installment to come out.,1396483200,,255,3.8653846153846154
6083981,5,B00GLPCKX8,I truly enjoyed Thor. Good to see him and rotten Loki work together for a change. Plenty of action in this sequel. Not to mention Ilove  the sense of humor throughtout the film. I see where there will be a 3rd sequel. Can`t wait? I suggested this movie to people I know..,1396483200,,271,4.211538461538462

6083983,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel has a really great thing going right now and their ""Avengers"" series of movies are continuing to set the stage for the next group movie.

Thor 2 is an entertaining escape from every day life. From the wondrous skyline of Asgard to the streets of Earth, Thor manages to keep an eye on his mortal friend Jane Foster. Marvel's plan, so far, is excellent, especially with Captain America 2 coming out this week. Just sit back and enjoy the ride... popcorn never tasted so good!",1396483200,,480,4.5813953488372094
6083984,4,B00GLPCKX8,What's not to love here? Thor i sbrilliantly portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. And Loki is great too. We really enjoy these stories,1396483200,,127,4.818181818181818
6083985,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Movie was monotonous.  Marvel's version of the Norse Myth is laughable, watered down garbage. The Dark Elves are star trek characters. Romance is contrived and Natalie Portman remains inexplicably unlikeable.",1396483200,4,208,5.933333333333334
6083986,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Seriously, UPS lost the DVD.  I had Prime shipping and didn't get it.  Ever.  After seeing it in the theater I rented it from Redbox...but Amazon solicited my opinion so I jumped at the chance ;)

If you like the Marvel movies, ""Thor: The Dark World""  is as good as the first Thor movie, but the ensemble magic of ""The Avengers"" is even better.  Any scene with Loki and Thor is great fun, but I just don't see on-screen chemistry between Jane and Thor - it seems forced.  Most of the movie is CG-heavy, which is expected, but I'd have enjoyed more fight scenes and good banter with Thor's other companions  and less of Natalie Portman suspended in mid-air while the Aether writhes around in her.",1396483200,,695,4.4603174603174605

6083995,5,B00GLPCKX8,"We waited for the DVD to come out inadvertently - many more pressing issues at the time. It would have been fun to see on the big screen. I think Tom HIddleston (Loki) stole the movie, as he darn near did with ""The Avengers."" I disliked Natalie Portman's portrayal of Jane Foster, but it's not Portman I have a problem with... Hemsworth plays Thor excellently and Jane Foster seems insignificant compared to Thor, though she is clearly an intellectual giant. In mythology, it was not uncommon for demigods to have relations with humans, almost always with disastrous results, and I imagine this story may go there -- I'm not a Marvel expert so I have no foreknowledge of this, but I can imagine Loki plotting against Thor and Jane's offspring. Anyway, I am glad there will be another Thor movie. Maybe the best thing of all is a foreboding of future actions by The Collector that could cut across the entire Marvel universe... stay tuned!",1396483200,,938,4.6909090909090905

6084000,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I will admit the graphics are excellent as usual in these superhero movies but the the action was okay! I mean they didn't give Idris Elba  as Heimdall to kick some Dark Elf butt especially when he could of had it with  Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim / Kurse and have an epic muscle fight!

Those four characters:  Volstagg,  Fandral, Hogun and Sif didn't have much to shine either! Especially one that didn't have much of a part and remained on another planet! So three out of four help Thor keep the Asgardian troops at bay but never showed them kicking Dark Elf butt! The action in general was not as great as the Avengers! You got two factions whose lives are more superior then human's and you can't give a very epic battle? I'm not saying this movie was bad but it wasn't that excellent! Enjoyable but not excellent!

The Story was typical but lacks complexity! I know its a Dark Elf lord wanting to spread darkness but  the movie was so quick it didn't give much complexity!

I heard that the next Captain America maybe better to watch then this!",1396396800,,1057,4.49738219895288

If you had not seen the 1st, they gave enough background to bring you up to speed without weighing the movie down.  Great new bad guy to fight, lots of action, with just the right amount of romance.  Loved this movie!",1396396800,,321,4.229508196721311

6084054,1,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie is further proof that Marvel Studios has gotten the big head and no longer thinks plot, characterization, creativity, or quality matter after you've established a franchise. Just like Iron Man 2 was not half as good as Iron Man 1, and Iron Man 3 was God-awful, Thor 2 is a serious step-down from the first movie. Natalie Portman is bland, empty, shallow, and uninteresting. Thor himself lacks any humor or fire in his belly, nothing to make us care a fig for his fate. The story is bland and a rehash of similar plots we've seen before. The whole film was painful to get through. All I could think was, ""I can't believe I spent $20 on this dvd..."" over and over. It had that Iron Man 3 disappointment, the bitter taste of having copper pennies in one's mouth. Boring, banal, empty. I pray that Captain America 2: Winter Soldier doesn't go in the same hapless direction. Marvel seems to think the American people are stupid enough to like anything they put out now. And perhaps they're right. For now at least. Only time will tell. This movie is proof that Marvel can indeed make a stinker.",1396137600,4,1100,4.532663316582915

Eccleston as the main villain was a brilliant casting in my opinion, but really, all the characters developed nicely. A fun movie with some huge, amazing action scenes and pacing that was spot on. I highly recommend watching this one.",1396137600,,450,4.6375

The acting is okay in parts, excellent in some, and not so much in others.  Special effects, yes...it's comics and they bring them to the screen in CG wonder.  Is Spike Lee anywhere to be found?  Of course, but you have to watch to find out where he shows up.  What of the others Shield has on-call, any of them?  Capt. America makes an appearance...hmmm, perhaps the next Marvel movie out is starring the Cap...where and to what extent?  Check it out to find out.  There's no, golden 'puny god' moment but all-in-all it's as fun a ride as any in the Marvel series...you either are loving these or not-so-much.

6084087,3,B00GLPCKX8,"The first six minutes are agonizing bad as the ""mythology"" is explained, the rest has some good actions sequences and an acceptable number of nonsensical events that border on outright failures of logic, and, of course, we have to set up the next movie.  The ending battle runs too long, but then that's the type of movie it is so one can't downgrade it too much I suppose.  Only the humor in the beginning really make this endurable for some of us.",1396051200,,449,4.463414634146342
6084088,5,B00GLPCKX8,"A Boomer relic, I hadn't seen a Marvel Studio film until I almost accidently watched  saw Thor (and only this winter).  I thought it was amazing:  all the Norse mythology came to life, and with great special effects and good comedic writing.  Saw Thor: The Dark World and backed into the Avengers.  While you can quibble about how the BiFrost was repaired and whether it all defies science as we know it, the acting is greatly improved and it is not from a better script--less humorous and less for Natalie Portman to do for sure.  But I think the actors have a familiarity and respect with one another:  Hiddleston's Loki is mesmerizing and this is really his movie but Chris Hemsworth's Thor has a gravitas that he has never had before.  This series is getting more Shakespearean as it goes along and I am much looking forward to another freestanding Thor before Hiddleston starts lighting up the BAFTAs and OSCARS and Hemsworth finds some worthy additions to RUSH.  Now I have to catch up on the other Marvel characters....",1396051200,,1026,4.687150837988827

6084117,3,B00GLPCKX8,"While it still mostly on par with the first THOR, this sequel feels bigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the previous one enjoyable. There are some fleeting moments of humor, but there's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has to save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether. Sure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a scientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going pretty good so far.

The movie would have to have been terribly horrible for me not to buy it, but in this case, Thor 2, is worth owning if you like the Marvel action movie series, which my family and I do. It was a preorder, and was shipped out to arrive at my home on the actual release day, and since the cost was a dollar or two cheaper than actually charged, the difference was credited back automatically and quickly. The set arrived in new condition, and the digital copy was compatible with my ultraviolet/flixster/vudu accounts, as well as my iTunes account. There's also a new addition to watch Disney movies online in conjunction with iTunes, so the movie was compatible there also.

6084160,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I can't write the BEST review-but I can write a SHORTER one!  I'm at a disadvantage by 1) Not reading the comic books 2) Not seeing Avengers, and 3) not seeing the first Thor movie! (At least I saw all 3 Iron Men).  I'd think the biggest fans would be teens, but there's enough here to keep a parent interested as well--especially a FEMALE parent.  I just think it's WRONG that Hemsworth should be more drool-worthy than Portman.  Maybe because he gets to show more skin?
With a movie like this you EXPECT great visuals.  You do GET great visuals.  I especially liked the bifrost bridge.  I'm not sure how I would have depicted it, but it looked great.  Yes, the funeral scene also was beautiful--and the off-world scenes were suitably awesome, and/or ominous.
What made this film unexpectedly relevant was a piece of news just a couple weeks ago that at an annual festival in England celebrating Norse mythology, the festival head insisted with a straight face that the world is about to face ""Ragnarok""--the Twilight of the Gods.  In Nordic mythology the world doesn't end with a whimper but a bang--a colossal war among the gods which will destroy all of humanity except one man and one woman who, like Adam and Eve, will be left to re-populate the world.  A Nordic tradition apparently states that when 3 winters occur without any intervening summer, it's a sure sign that Ragnarok is next.  Reportedly the last 2 summers were unusually cool and wet in the Nordic countries, leading this devotee to insist that Ragnarok comes this year...

In this movie it seems as if Thor manages to prevent something like Ragnarok.  Once every 5,000 years (?) all 9 realms which circle Yggdrasil come into alignment, and...well uh...there are dark elves in spaceships and they want to take the whole cosmos back to utter darkness...WHY?  Who knows?  Would they still have a world in that case?  I assume they see GREAT in utter darkness?

Whatever..these 9 realms don't correlate with the nine planets of our solar system (if we add Pluto back in) so they must exist, like heaven and hell, in some normally invisible realms.  Leading me back to...Portman has TOO MUCH visible clothes, Hemsworth JUST ABOUT RIGHT, and Stellan/Erik Selvig, WAY NOT ENOUGH!

Obviously I think TOO MUCH for this kind of movie.  Yes, the relationship between Thor and Loki is well-played; perhaps the strongest plot element.  I think they could have gotten a lot more use out of Kat Dennings as Darcy and Jonathan Howard as Ian, Natalie's ""intern"" and ""intern's intern"".  They were clearly under-utilized.  Maybe next time?",1395964800,,2591,4.8122171945701355

6084164,4,B00GLPCKX8,The movie was great. The 3D was great on my Samsung plasma 3D. I just hate that movies now have bars on the bottom and top of it. I know that makes it the same as the theater but I thought that was the idea of a widescreen TV. If there was an option to convert to widescreen in the Bluray menu I would have liked that as it truncated the 3D giving it less pop from the couch and requiring close seating for the great effects.,1395964800,,425,3.896551724137931

6084204,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The first Thor movie was more entertaining for me, but this sequel is still a pretty good movie to watch.
Lots of action and we get to see more of Asgard. Still it was a little disconcerting to see the Asgardians
use swords and spears fighting against the invading Dark Elves armed with ray guns and plasma rifles.
Asgard's anti-aircraft guns looked lame and the palace force-field somehow got sabotaged by elves
sneaking into Asgard undercover using invisibility and teleportation devices. The bad elves had all
the cool hi-tech gadgets while the Asgardians had their fancy shields, swords, spears, axes and a
one of a kind magic hammer.",1395878400,,638,4.916666666666667

I give this movie a 2 Eyes Open, I didn't nod off to sleep once during the film !",1395792000,,394,4.266666666666667

If course though, how can one go wrong with Thor?",1395705600,,243,3.7254901960784315
6084227,5,B00GLPCKX8,Well done; Loki is once again one of  the best villains on the screen today. Curious to see how the Collector fits in all this.,1395705600,,127,4.08
6084228,4,B00GLPCKX8,If you're a fan of the Marvel world you'll like this one.  It's a big improvement over the first Thor movie which I thought was more like a 50's sic-fi B movie.,1395705600,,160,4.0
6084229,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Another solid Thor movie, and another great performance by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Thor is actually my least favorite Avenger but these movies have certainly been a welcome addition to the franchise.",1395705600,,199,5.25
6084230,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel apparently learned from themistakes the first ""Thor"" movie made and made a much more action-packed, yet somehow character driven film. From the time-and-space displacements, to the workings of the Aether, to the dark solidiers, the raid on Asgard and the battles on Earth, the action and visuals are stunning.

The supporting cast is also given room to shine, particularly Jaime Alexander, Rene Russo and Tom Hiddleston as Loki.

The Blu-Ray transfer is well done and the generous amount of Special Features is always a treat, especially the ""Marvel One-Shots""

Gotta give this five stars...Marvel's on to someting good.",1395705600,,627,5.313131313131313
6084231,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel continues to put out solid products and stories and Thor: The Dark World is another worthy addition to their slate. Great story, remember that it is completely fantastical and about super heroes. I've watched it already, several times, after only owning for a couple of weeks!",1395705600,,283,5.042553191489362
6084232,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Awesome movie, but the volume levels are extremely inconsistent. During dialog I had it turned up to 35 and during action I had to turn it down to 8. It was that bad. But the movie was great so if you can get past the volume issues you should watch it.",1395705600,,252,3.9607843137254903
6084233,5,B00GLPCKX8,Excellent Super Hero adventure with a couple of nice plot twists.  Great special effects.  More serious than the first Thor movie.,1395705600,,130,5.142857142857143
6084234,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I love this movie! It helps that he's really good looking BUT I thought the plot was good, plenty of action, and just enough suspense that it doesn't stress you out. And let's face it, I haven't been disappointed by a Marvel in a while.",1395705600,,236,4.266666666666667
6084235,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Implausible, depressing story. Supposedly, an army of creatures that want the power of darkness to reign throughout the universe has been rendered dormant; but, Thor's girlfried goes to just the right place in vast London and stumbles into a side room and falls through a vortex and comes right to the single place where, if she stupidly sticks her arm in a crack between two rocks, will be the impetus for the dark forces to be able to re-start their massive space ship and come to Earth to begin their destructive return to power--ridiculous.  Thor's father, the King is so clueless, you wonder how his kingdom ever achieved its greatness. I thought the Queen was the most compelling character in the entire movie, and her part only lasted about 10 minutes.  About the actor playing Thor: either you love him or hate him. I was reading and loving Thor comic books over 40 years ago. The actor here has more of the presence of a beefed up Chippindale dancer than as a noble, crusade-driven super hero. He is just too enamored of his great looks, one gets the impression--very similar to the actor in the first Captain America movie. There was just no drama--you knew Thor would defeat the bad-guys. And, there was insufficient back-story on the bad guys, certainly not enough to get the viewer to dislike them or to fear them as formidable enough to get us thinking that Thor might not prevail.  Production values are great. Pacing is good. Acting is so-so. Just too much of a stupid, uncompelling story line.",1395705600,,1510,4.712121212121212
6084236,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Great storyline, enjoyed it very much! Great action movie, balanced well with drama and comedy breaks...

Tom H. is brilliant as Loki, the black sheep, jealous, and easy to sympathize with brother who will never earn the right to be king of Asgard.

Chris H. IS Thor! Having read the comic growing up, the regal, god with a penchant for brawling attitude and demeanor seems to be a natural for him to pull off. (Whoever cast/suggested Chris H. as Thor should get a raise...)

Special effects were great too. As a long time Marvel comic book fan, it is exciting and satisfying to see some of the elements I really enjoyed as a reader start to become a part of the movie franchises.",1395705600,,680,4.512195121951219

6084239,2,B00GLPCKX8,"While the movie wasn't awful, it wasn't as good as the first Thor.  Lots of action and fight scenes that went on forever, and really didn't need to.",1395705600,,148,4.285714285714286
6084240,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel movies continue to impress, but Thor is easily the best of their current properties. Hats off to the Thor crew for another great film.",1395705600,,141,4.68
6084241,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel just knows how to do it. While not as good as the first one, T:TDW was highly entertaining. Hemsworth holds his own, but I'd hate to be an actor playing opposite Tom Hiddleston...that guy just steals every scene!

I've missed seeing Renee Russo on the big screen.",1395705600,,270,4.625

6084244,3,B00GLPCKX8,Just average.  Hard to get into. Not a bad movie.  If you liked the first movie you will like this one.,1395705600,,103,3.857142857142857
6084245,5,B00GLPCKX8,"As always with the Marvel comics movies there was a lot of action, entertainment, and some very funny scenes. I would definitely recommend this movie.",1395705600,,150,5.04
6084246,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I enjoyed the first Thor movie, but this one was just plain kick ass! It's non-stop action, drama, romance, sci-fi/fantasy, adventure and a touch of comedy, it's got it all! The love story with Thor and the scientist continues and gives the ladies a satisfying story line even if they are not into the rest. The drama between Thor and Loki is nail-biting, always waiting for the moment Loki will betray his brother (it doesn't happen when you think it will!) The adventure moves along without a bit of lag. The dark elves and the ""sciency"" backdrop of Asgard and its kindred realms fill the sci-fi/fantasy craving. Add in some fun side kicks and a professor whose mind is coming undone (in a cute, not scary way) and you have a bit of fun sprinkled in. All that and no bad language so the whole family can enjoy it, without it feeling dumbed down or infantile. You'll want to watch it more than once. Hats off to the screenwriter, director and incredible acting by every member of the cast, not to mention the artists that made the special effects so believable and enchanting!",1395705600,,1077,4.585492227979275
6084247,4,B00GLPCKX8,This movie is better than the original Thor from a few years past. It's well worth the $5.99 HD rental price,1395705600,,108,4.190476190476191
6084248,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The movie was what you have come to expect from Marvel.  Snappy dialogue with a compelling story line all sandwiched between amazing special effects.  What sets Thor 2 apart from the first is the development of the characters we were familiar with from Thor 1 and the Avengers.  The familial dynamic between Odin, Frigga and their sons is further explored and that is what really drives the story.  Loki's character in particular does a great turn showing a remarkable evolution and depth while still keeping the viewer guessing of his motives and goals.  All in all a very entertaining show which, outside of a few plot twists advancing the overall Marvel Comics Universe agenda by setting up sequels, does not blaze much new territory but is well worth the watch.",1395705600,,765,4.8538461538461535
6084249,5,B00GLPCKX8,I like the Marvel movies and Thor was filled with action and of course it was continuing with the first Thor movie.,1395705600,,115,4.2727272727272725

6084259,2,B00GLPCKX8,"You begin to like Lokie and dislike Jane Foster...Why? The reuniting of the lovers was anything but romantic and not genuine.  The drama was disjointed and very hard to follow.  Too many screen changes from one realm to another and personality/character changes (Lokie to Capt America to solider to whatever!) caused a confusion in a viewer's mind that made watching the movie torturous.  Key people dyeing was not fun to watch either.  It's too bad that a better screen play couldn't have happened...there was more sincerity in Darcy's new romance than that of Jane and the god of thunder!  And, furthermore, viewer's start to feel sorry for warrior chick and wonder why Thor wouldn't just fall in love with her instead of a stuck-up mortal!",1395705600,,742,4.904

6084268,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I thought the performances by Hemsworth and Hiddleston made this movie what it is. Their performances were the reason I bought it. If you like Tom Hiddleston's work, I encourage you to check out the PBS Shakespearean Series, The Hollow Crown, and his recent performances as Coriolanus performed on stage at the Donmar Warehouse in London.",1395705600,,338,5.053571428571429

6084270,5,B00GLPCKX8,"this was a great story, action packed, fast paced, our family has watched the series of movies and recommend them to anyone!",1395705600,,124,4.681818181818182
6084271,4,B00GLPCKX8,I love Marvel comic characters. Although I think that more see n's could have been added. More action with Thor flying and using that hammer,1395705600,,140,4.64
6084272,5,B00GLPCKX8,Saw this in the movies with my daughter.  Loved it again on DVD.  This one is better than the first and love the story line especially as it pertains to the brothers.,1395705600,,166,4.15625
6084273,4,B00GLPCKX8,It was a very good movie that didn't fall off from the first made.  Chris Haworth did an outstanding job.,1395705600,,105,4.25
6084274,3,B00GLPCKX8,It's a pretty good movie we just kind of dark in some places  Thor keeps getting his butt kicked in this movie too and he is a God of thunder,1395705600,,141,3.7
6084275,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Movie had lots of action, and of course a twist at the end to set up a new Thor for another time.",1395705600,,97,3.4545454545454546
6084276,4,B00GLPCKX8,I love Thor. I thought that the special effects were very well done. I would definitely rent or purchase this movie.,1395705600,,116,4.571428571428571
6084277,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Any fan of the Thor series, will surely find this installment well worth watching. Although special effects are exceptional, some of it takes on an almost too surreal feel.  All the characters of the original cast seemed to have recaptured their roles with a few anti-heroes added in.  Overall, well worth watching and a very captivating edition in the tradition of Thor the God of thunder.",1395705600,,390,4.893939393939394
6084278,5,B00GLPCKX8,it had a very intriguing storyline and the twist and turns for a next time saga. Thor is stoic AND REFLECTIVE individual.,1395705600,,121,4.545454545454546
6084279,5,B00GLPCKX8,Much better than the first.  Very entertaining.  Stays true to Greek mythology. Graphics are amazing  would highly recommend to anyone,1395705600,,134,5.6
6084280,4,B00GLPCKX8,Not a big fan of Thor but it was definitely worth a watch. Was much better than the 1st Thor movie by far.,1395619200,,106,3.652173913043478
6084281,3,B00GLPCKX8,"The sequel: The Dark World was interesting but not nearly as entertaining as the first Thor movie. Hopefully the next Thor adventure (and you know there will be another) can be a ""little"" better.",1395619200,,195,4.764705882352941
6084282,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I enjoyed the first Thor and the Avengers, so I thought this would be good to watch as well.  However, it wasn't just a good diversion, it is a well presented story.  It is full of action, angst and humor.  But, it is also, a love story--not just between Thor and his love interest.  It's also a love story of family and friends.  Additionally, duty and obligation is the huge elephant in the room.  How Thor and his brother deal with it...well, that's just another reason to watch Thor: The Dark World.",1395619200,,503,4.413043478260869
6084283,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The story continues!  Thor continues to have battles; Loki continues to be most untrustworthy (and we never know whose side he is really on), Rulership in Asgard continues to be less than fully stable, love continues to blossom around Thor, and Stan Lee is likely to pop up just about anywhere.  I love it!",1395619200,,306,4.648148148148148
6084284,5,B00GLPCKX8,"When I saw this movie in the theater I knew that I would be purchasing it on release.

Without any spoilers, the movie is everything you can hope for in a sequel, from plenty of action to comedy, it's all there.  Heck, even many of the battle sequences have comedy touches in them that just make this an overly enjoyable experience to watch, especially since it's of course part of a large world that they are making all these super hero movies for.

Even the special features are enjoyable.

Overall, 5/5 stars in my opinion - but chances are, you've already seen it and have your own opinion.",1395619200,,594,4.472222222222222
6084285,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I love the movie but even if I didn't, I would have watched the moved just to be able to watch Chris Hemsworth.  I am 65 yrs old but I ain't dead yet - LOL!  He is a good actor, and he's good looking.  I don't know how he is in real life - I hope he is a nice man - I read where he and his wife just had a baby last Nov. and announced in Jan that they are going to have twins - he's been a busy bee.  I am a L&D nurse and I thought drs. didn't recommend  getting pregnant that soon after having one baby but then it's been a long time since I worked.  Things change.  But the movie was very good and entertaining and that's what I like. :-)",1395619200,,640,3.627737226277372

6084287,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed the first one. The screen was so dark-almost black...you couldn't see anything and the sound was not good. The music and battle noises were very loud, but the dialogue was almost imperceptible. The plot was just weird....",1395619200,,263,5.0
6084288,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The Dark World was all that I hoped it would be. Thor was his usual awesome self. His brother was even better this time. Humor in the spots that needed it, and the bravery of the good guys versus the really bad guys was superb.

I highly recommend watching this in Blu-ray altho 3-D probably would be fun also.",1395619200,,310,4.254237288135593

6084290,5,B00GLPCKX8,I was really looking forward to seeing this and came away very happy as to story and overall effects to this movie. Bring on the third movie!,1395619200,,141,4.2592592592592595
6084291,4,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed this film. Another Marvel winner! Can you say WARP GRENADES!!!! Good interplay between characters. Would have liked less brooding and more smashing!,1395619200,,158,5.625
6084292,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Hemsworth looks delicious as always, but the plot was intriguing enough to keep my attention too ;-) The graphics were well done and the acting superb.",1395619200,,151,4.846153846153846
6084293,4,B00GLPCKX8,"If you're wondering whether this movie ""works"" on one level or another, just stop. Do you like a good adventure movie? Are you a fan of comics and/or comic lore? Did you like any of the Phase 1 movies? Then you'll love this one too. Marvel Studios has nailed the genre and the formula for putting these movies out.
I'm not going to go crazy w/ the details of the movie however I will say that the cast is spot on and I dare anyone to come up w/ better actors for the roles, especially after seeing this film.
Moral of the story, a very enjoyable movie and done as well as any comic movie. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is b/c I felt like the third act was completely predictable. Well done, just predictable.",1395619200,,717,4.16546762589928
6084294,4,B00GLPCKX8,"This is a good continuation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nothing incredibly mind-blowing save for the mid-credit scene but a solid entry nonetheless. The Marvel One-Shot, ""All Hail the King,"" was very cool.",1395619200,,211,5.424242424242424
6084295,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Great picture, sound and of course another home run by Marvel. Also I love the fact that I have a digital copy so I can watch it when I am on the road. Last, but not least, I have the 3D for when I want to experience it in a different way.",1395619200,,239,3.6153846153846154

6084297,5,B00GLPCKX8,My Grandsons love all the Avengers.  After watching the Blu-Ray I downloaded the free digital copy to my Amazon account so the boys could watch it on my iPad on long drives.,1395619200,,173,4.40625
6084298,5,B00GLPCKX8,This is the best Thor movie yet. Good extra and special features. 3D movie and digital copy a plus .,1395619200,,100,4.05
6084299,5,B00GLPCKX8,This Thor film was everything I wanted from the first one. It had all the lore and great action. The actors really embodied the characters they where playing and it had a great story line to go with it. The blu-ray has a lot of extras that are fun and well worth the extra money for the movie.,1395532800,,293,4.068965517241379
6084300,2,B00GLPCKX8,Tried to watch this on Amazon TV and movie kept stopping to update?  Coudn't take it after third time in 30 minutes shut it off.  Waste of monet/,1395532800,,145,4.142857142857143
6084301,4,B00GLPCKX8,Good flick. They are still doing a good job with a character that has been handled in a campy fashion in the past!,1395532800,,114,4.0
6084302,4,B00GLPCKX8,Just good fun.  Really bad guys and really good guys.  Thor saves the universe and falls in love.  What is not to like.,1395532800,,119,4.086956521739131
6084303,4,B00GLPCKX8,A Good movie. Keeps you laughing and interested the entire time. Can't wait until my dvd comes in the mail.,1395532800,,107,4.4
6084304,3,B00GLPCKX8,just more graphics in this one...story line sucks. Loki's character could have been developed to become the best antagonist ever!,1395532800,,129,5.5
6084305,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I think they should of  looked deeper into the love story. The action was great and the effects were great. How ever the story was weird because it really didn't fallow the ""Avengers"" movie. It was a side story and very shot parts. I can't what to part 3 when Thor return s how and kicks Luckies but after he fines out what he did to his mother and father.",1395532800,,356,4.085714285714285
6084306,4,B00GLPCKX8,"A good movie that in some ways are better than the first Thor.  While the beginning of the movie there is a lot of explaining of plot, the final action battle is very well done.  Tom Hiddelston steals the show.",1395532800,,210,4.225
6084307,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Husband and daughter saw in theater, we ordered it on day of release. Have watched it also and it is awesome move, just as great as the first Thor. We will watch this many many times.",1395532800,,183,4.111111111111111

6084309,3,B00GLPCKX8,"No great plot here. Not even real great acting. But there's eye candy and a lot of things getting blown to pieces, which is what you expect from this sort of movie.",1395532800,,164,4.15625
6084310,5,B00GLPCKX8,Great movie action packed it was fast moving with it's tender moments. I loved the fighting scene the best and I to give to Loki he steals the show for me I cant wait to see the next movie.,1395532800,,189,3.871794871794872
6084311,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I must admit, just watched this through Amazon's streaming service, and I have to say I rather enjoyed both! I did notice some warbles in the very beginning but once I got hooked on the movie, if they continued I didn't notice. The movie was great! A fun, entertaining time and if you're a fan and you haven't see this, what are you waiting for? And for those who aren't necessarily Marvel fans, there is a kind of Star Trek vibe in there so I think even if you care not so much for the character, you will enjoy this for the sheer spectacle. The story was an enjoyable romp as well and made me feel like a kid again. Thanks!",1395532800,,625,4.1735537190082646
6084312,4,B00GLPCKX8,Thor is the equivalent of DC's Aquaman a fish out of water but you can't dislike the character. Good action movie but the plot need tweaking.,1395446400,,141,4.461538461538462
6084313,1,B00GLPCKX8,"I was dubious about this movie for how off the mark the first one was. But this was far worse.  Little of the comic book universe remains in this piece that felt way more star wars than Thor. Space ships, lasers even sound effects right out of a lucas film.  I cant image what possess a film maker to savage a franchise like this unless they are ashamed of the source material.  Even if I was not a fan of the comics I still wouldn't have been pleased with this one.  Anyone should be able to see that this was just a star wars film with a norsish facade.",1395446400,3,555,4.064220183486238
6084314,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Sequels usually don't make the grade, but this one to me went beyond the original. So I would say that this is a once a month watcher.",1395446400,,134,4.0
6084315,3,B00GLPCKX8,"The story felt rushed a little bit because it left you wanting to learn more about the enemy, their abilities, and where they truly came from. Chris Hemsworth did a good job in this film, as well as the rest of the cast. It's just the story is what is always lacking when it comes to Marvel movies. Some Marvel Comics have been this way in not having a really good story line but there are some that are very good which will never see the Movie screen. Thor can be such a great character on film and marvel isn't really taking advantage of it. The movie could have been better imho.

It feels like a mini-series of films leading up to another over-crowded movie of characters; the Avengers 2. But it was okay for what it was.",1395446400,,725,4.253623188405797
6084316,4,B00GLPCKX8,the extra for the mandarin leaves you wondering though.  If you like the characters this is one you should have in you library but if not I would not recommend it.,1395446400,,163,4.258064516129032
6084317,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I really love these movies - love the ""Knights in Shining Armor"" type!  It is not a ""bad acting movie"" but exciting.  Great for the ""young at hearts"" no matter what age!",1395446400,,169,4.25

6084319,4,B00GLPCKX8,The movie was a bit slow but I guess It was ok. Wasn't very much impressed considering they talked the whole entire movie instead of filled with action scenes,1395446400,,158,4.482758620689655
6084320,3,B00GLPCKX8,The movie is certainly from a comic book and not to be mistaken a modern classic.  The repeat characters show up an do what they do and I cannot find fault with them.  The story-line revolves around Dark Elves as the bad guys and I found them to be the characters that I related to the most.  It is a good movie to sit at home with your teenage children on movie night.,1395446400,,369,4.027397260273973
6084321,3,B00GLPCKX8,Story jumps around a bit.  Not sure how Earth is involved.  All about action and not so much about plot that makes sense!,1395446400,,121,4.217391304347826

It leaves me wanting more for sure..",1395446400,,122,4.125
6084323,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie is exciting. Full of action and special effects. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop, I have now watched it twice and will be watching it again I'm sure.

6084324,5,B00GLPCKX8,"First, i actually saw this movie in theaters in 3D and thought is was really good. Second, don't write a negative review over something that you failed to research before buying. To all 74 of you that gave a 1 star review for the movie being bad, you should of watched the movie before buying it. 8 dollars to go to a movie theater; you probably have nothing better to do, so your negative. This movie had a decent amount of action, comedy, romance and drama.",1395446400,,459,4.348837209302325
6084325,1,B00GLPCKX8,This movie sucks. Special effects cannot save this movie. You would think that hollywood writers could figure out how to tell a story for this big a budget. I guess the Harvard MBA's got involved instead of actual storytellers.,1395446400,7,227,4.846153846153846
6084326,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Saw the first Thor movie for obvious reasons - Hunky Hemsworth. You definitely have to see the first one to understand this sequel. Although a typical superhero plot - saves the world, gets the girl - Thor: The Dark World has more supernatural stuff in this movie and an even more evil and ugly villan than Loki. A sad twist, some cool transportation and some new supporting acting made it something to watch.",1395446400,,409,4.616438356164384
6084327,3,B00GLPCKX8,The story not bad but its not as good as the first one. I didn't like how techy everything looked. I know the movies claim magic is just advanced technology but in the comics its just magic. I like Thor as a god with a magic hammer better than an alien with a science hammer.,1395446400,,275,4.0181818181818185
6084328,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie is worth every penny you spend on yourself and/or your family to watch. :)  Hubby and I enjoyed it immensely. We felt it was as good as the first Thor movie, maybe even better. Appreciated the growth of some of the characters. Lots of action and a plot twist (love those!, thank you Marvel!)",1395360000,,302,4.392857142857143

6084332,1,B00GLPCKX8,"The only reason I watch these Marvel movies is for the action. However, Marvel is starting to take my favorite superheroes, and make them into soap operas. I was expecting action from the new Thor, but it seemed to concentrate on the love story. Also, it tries to hard to be funny. If Marvel spent the same amount of time in the comedy aspect then the movie would have a lot more action. I was extremely disappointed.",1395360000,3,417,4.428571428571429
6084333,5,B00GLPCKX8,Saw this movie on the big screen and had to have it to go with the first Thor movie that I already own.,1395360000,,103,3.5217391304347827

6084336,5,B00GLPCKX8,Way better than thr first. Can't wait for the second avengers. Really liked the effects of the movie always kept you guessing. Did not see the ending coming.,1395360000,,157,4.642857142857143
6084337,5,B00GLPCKX8,Loved it in theatres and still love it now. The special effects are awesome!! We have watched it 3 times since we got it in!!,1395360000,,125,4.04
6084338,5,B00GLPCKX8,This one is my favorite of all the Marvel Movies so far.  The storyline is really good and your on the edge of your seat (couch) the whole time.,1395360000,,144,3.9655172413793105
6084339,3,B00GLPCKX8,And glad I waited for it to go to DVD and not spend 16 bucks at the theater. The story line is lame and there really is no suspense at all.,1395360000,,139,3.5161290322580645
6084340,5,B00GLPCKX8,I like Loki in Thor: The dark world and the scene when Loki transforms into Captain America and talk to Thor.,1395360000,,109,4.238095238095238
6084341,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The action was BIG.  The costumes and special effects were beautiful.  The drama was heartfelt, and the humor was ACTUALLY FUNNY!  And there's a LOT of humor in this movie.  If you're one of the people who is turned off by the humor in past Marvel films, this movie might turn you off... like crazy.  Personally, I think Marvel is getting better with experience, and this is their best movie, yet.",1395360000,2,397,4.535211267605634

6084344,4,B00GLPCKX8,"It was a fun movie that has followed the other recent marvel movies (Thor 1, Avengers) in that it's a ""hurry up and save the world"" movie.  The story-line from the Marvel Universe that forms the base for this movie is pretty complex.  It would be awesome if they told these stories over a few movies so they could really enrich and develop them, but they did a good job of fitting it in one.

This one really followed the first one very well and there is nothing that was 'dropped' or missed from the first Thor or The Avengers. There were some twists in the plot and I am eagerly anticipating the next one...if there is a next one...seemed like there might be.

6084381,1,B00GLPCKX8,"What happens we you combine a huge budget, phenomenal special effects, and a celebrity cast with a terrible script and lackluster direction?  The Dark World.

The acting was in even more dire straits than Valhalla, especially Natalie Portman, who was absolutely limp, and Kat Dennings, who may have won the ""most annoying character"" award.

The script was so full of absolutely ridiculous holes it was impossible to suspend disbelief, and the actors looked like they were clog-dancing their best to get to the end of this drab and dreadful extravaganza.  Seriously, a hookup scene in the middle of the end of the world?

And the evil villains we are supposed to believe want the universe we inhabit destroyed because it's an ""accident"" of some sort strains credulity in the worst possible way.  Even the villains were too absurd and implausible to enjoy.  You want an evil elf in your movie, try Hellboy 2.  At least Loki continues to be an engaging character, so there's some hope for the franchise, but not until Marvel decides to up their game and not treat it like a foregone conclusion that we'll dump money on anything with a lot of big fight sequences and absolutely no artistic merit.

When you compare to a real action film like the Avengers or the Star Trek reboot, the lackluster feel of this film is just palpable.  Save your time and your money for something that deserves it.",1395187200,7,1389,4.75

6084384,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I saw this movie at the local theater when it can out and was wowed by the cinema/CGtography.  This so preoccupies one, one does not follow the story as to the plot and meaning.  Even after watching the excellent product of Blu-ray, DVD and download in my Blu-ray player on 1080 P, I still do not fully understand the story line.

I think it is the ""Dark Matter"" that throws me even though I have a science background.  The film will hold your interest even though you don't get it!  I am a  Norwegian mythology fan and have read the Thor comics when a kid.  These films brings me into that genre quickly and the excellent cast selection makes it real!

Additionally, there are some great scenes of London and Greenwich that bring back memories of  the Primary Meridian and Palace in the latter.

I buy the Blu-ray/DVD combo because if I want to take it for my car, my car only plays DVD.  So now I have to buy them separate, and probably spend more money?

6084411,4,B00GLPCKX8,"As something of a budding ""Avengers"" fan, I've greatly enjoyed watching the films, both the collective ""Avengers"" film and the films starring singular members of the team.  So far, my verdict is that the first films starring these characters are probably the strongest -- ""Thor,"" ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" and the first ""Iron Man"" were good solid films in their own rights and could easily stand on their own merits.  These films laid down the basic origin story of each hero, enabling a newcomer to understand the story without having to slog through forty years of comics beforehand, but they could still appeal to longtime fans as well.  The second and third ""Iron Man"" movies were weaker in comparison to the first, in my opinion, but given how much I enjoyed ""Thor"" I expected to enjoy the second film as much as the first.

Unfortunately, ""Thor: The Dark World"" falls into the same territory as ""Iron Man 2"" -- it's weaker and less enjoyable than its predecessor.  But it's still a fun film to watch, and has some enjoyable moments.

""Thor: The Dark World"" picks up three years after the events of the first film, with Thor taking his duties of protecting the Nine Realms seriously and his human love interest, Jane Foster, continuing her scientific studies.  While investigating what appears to be a wormhole in London, Jane gets sucked in briefly and is merged with a superweapon called the Aether, which has the power to bring eternal darkness to the universe.  This makes her a target for both the Asgardians, who want the weapon out of the wrong hands, and the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, who want to use the Aether to bring darkness to all the realms.  Thor wants to protect Jane as well as defend the realms, but in order to protect all he holds dear he may have to make a deal with the devil... his brother, Loki, still imprisoned for the events of ""Avengers"" and desperate to break free and gain vengeance and power.

Naturally, this isn't a movie that sparks a lot of cerebral discussion, and even though it uses elements of Norse mythology, trying to compare it to the actual Norse folklore will only irritate you.  It's very fun to look at, though, with creative and well-made visuals and some eye-popping special effects.  The dark elves' spacecraft are especially well-done, especially with their cloaking tech.  The elves' designs themselves aren't particularly memorable, and they look and act more like the orcs from ""Lord of the Rings"" than anything elven.

The scenes with the Asgardians, strangely enough, are the weakest in the film.  Their dialogue is probably meant to sound noble and grand, but comes across as stilted and awkward.  It doesn't help that everyone plays their lines out as if they were bored.  Chris Hemsworth was at his best in the original film and in ""Avengers"" when he was gloriously hammy and over-the-top, but here he's simply boring.  And Odin's sudden disdain for humans comes across as rather jarring, especially since he cast Thor out of Asgard in the first film precisely for his disdain for lesser beings.  A small continuity hiccup, but an annoying one.

The film is at its best when it's focusing on the human characters (especially Erik or Darcy) or on Loki.  Tom Hiddleston is far and away one of the best villains to come out of a Marvel movie -- he plays his scenes with such delightful slickness, and is capable of being gloriously over-the-top or coolly understated as the plot requires, and even manages to inject some actual pathos into his role.  Loki is a villain you either love or love to hate, and in contrast Malekith, the primary villain of this film, comes across as largely forgettable.  This could be a problem in future films, as Marvel can't rely on Loki to provide the primary conflict of EVERY Avengers movie.

Not as good as its predecessor, this is still a fun movie, with plenty of action, humor, and even a bit of romance that doesn't overtake the film.  Naturally it ends on a giant sequel hook, and there are a few ""stingers"" buried in the credits that hint at future adventures... and perils...",1395100800,,4095,4.741889985895628

6084433,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor the Dark World is one of Marvel's worst outings yet.

I was embarrassed for the good actors in this movie.  The effects (at least on my 52 inch Sony HDTV) looked as convincing as an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation.  The story telling was weak, the directing was bad the drama was unconvincing and entirely predictable, the gravity sticks resolution was painfully simplistic, it was barely worth reaching the end.  Malekith was barely a presence at all.., did he have 4 lines in the whole movie?  The story tellers completely failed to impart the gravity of the situation in any significant way, while simultaneously failing to convey the awe of the 9 worlds aligning in any visual way which was primarily visualized as invisible walls between worlds, and a cel phone conversation between Earth and Asgard, or wherever they were.

The first Thor at least started off very strong and had tons of potential, even if the ending was kinda lame... this movie was lame from start to finish.  The actors playing Thor, Loki and Odin, as always give spectacular life to these characters, but what a shame to waste that talent on such a clich and poorly produced movie.

In short.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, its another in a string of disappointing Marvel outings from the most recent ASM, to The Wolverine (which could have been great, much like the first Thor, but crashed and burned in the end, much like the first Thor)  to the abysmal Wolverine Origins before that and both Iron Man 2 and 3.  I am still looking forward to The Winter Soldier, and hopeful that it will be good.  I am convinced however that Joss Whedon will deliver on the next Avengers movie.

Marvel's best remain...  Iron Man, Spider-man 2 (with Tobey Maguire) and The Avengers  with Avengers achieving near perfection in capturing the character of the Marvel Universe, while telling a compelling story with relevant character arcs, drama and humor.  They just about nailed it.  Im not saying making great movies is easy, but pumping out mediocrity will eventually result in diminishing returns, and both Iron Man and Thor were basically riding on the coat-tails of the Avengers.  Smarter movies will pay far greater rewards down the line.",1395014400,7,2233,4.801047120418848

For what it is, it fits in nicely with the overall direction Marvel has gone to pull together their properties into a overall universe.  X-Men, Fantastic Four, Avengers, Iron Man, Spiderman etc don't inhabit their own parts of their world, they all share the same one so naturally the characters would and should interact with each other.  Granted the three I mentioned are licensed to other studios so it is funny that Marvel can't make movies that tie into their other properties for now.",1394928000,,764,4.528985507246377

I had high hopes for this movie especially after the first Thor and The Avengers.  But those high hopes were dashed when I realized this movie was just...kinda boring actually.  Loki's delicious evil self was wasted on this movie.  Natalie Portman was just so so and honestly, a little bit annoying.  Actually all the side characters were bleah.  I found myself thinking of my grocery shopping list as I was watching this movie.  It just didn't pull me in.  I'm not going to give away the plot or the ending.  But it's pretty obvious how this movie was going to end after the first 30 minutes.  The plot was just soooo ridiculous.  I'll probably still buy the blu-ray because I want to add this to my Marvel collection.  But ugh, I really wish this movie was better.  So disappointed.",1394928000,,884,4.547770700636943

I love how they worked in the clean up that was on going in their universe on the tv show Marvel's Shield after the movie was released in theaters.  I am assuming that something about this movie will be mentioned during the next Avengers movie or at least referenced.

I was never much of a Thor fan while growing up but these Thor movies are actually among my most favorite Marvel comic book movie adaptions. Thor 2 has great action sequences, stunning sets and visuals, an excellent cast of characters, excellent costumes and wardrobe...just about everything about it is top notch and beautifully done.

6084471,4,B00GLPCKX8,"As the Marvel Universe continues to the expand, we return to Asgard with a new chapter in Thor's world. While it is not a perfect sequel, it is definitely a step up from Iron Man 3.

In this film we see the aftermath of what The Avengers film has labeled 'New York' (The battle of New York) as Loki is imprisoned. At the same time the Thor mythos is expanded for fans of the film who had never read the comic books . The fans are introduced to Malaketh and the dark elves and a lot more character development with characters such as Odin Frigga and the Warriors Three. There is also an expansion on the love story between Thor and Jane, and if there is one thing that the Marvel films have done well it is the importance of romance. Once again, like the first, the story is driven by comedy with great one liners and a few very well executed surprises. This film however, is by no means perfect as the major failure is the a weak development on Malaketh. The acting choice is wise, but there is no story behind him and a villainous persona that holds no candle compared to Loki and because of that, you pretty much come into this film knowing that Thor is going to win and story is going to continue on. Yet in this film what makes it all worth while is the scene in between the credits, as the bigger and better story finally sheds a little of the mystery as well as an introduction to a very unusual character in the Marvel Universe.

Will there be a Thor 3, who knows. As of now Thor's world seems to be the one that is really being worked on and a lot of it is being developed on the show 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' Who knows what we will get, but for the time being let the story continue.",1394928000,3,1692,4.17125382262997

This new installment in Thor is a great addition for those who enjoyed the previous Thor as well as The Avengers. The bonus features on this Blu-ray are also entertaining. The Marvel One-Shot included provides a interesting follow up to Iron Man 3.

So if you want to bring this movie along with you there's a new option in DisneyMoviesAnywhere.,1394841600,,682,4.788135593220339
6084478,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor The Dark World is a very action-packed, visually pleasing, and entertaining time at the movies.  I ultimately really enjoyed the movie.  However, the film does have some notable issues.  In many ways Thor 2 is superior to the first film, but in others it is inferior.

The film takes place sometime after the Avengers.  Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been locked up in the prison in Asghard for what he did in New York.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and everyone else are fighting to restore peace to the nine realms.  Meanwhile the villain named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his race called the Dark Elves have returned from their slumber.  Their goal is to obtain a substance called Ether to destroy the nine realms and return everything to darkness.  Meanwhile, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends come across a dimensional anomaly.  This is happening because all nine realms are lining up which happens every-so-often.  Because of this she is transported to Asghard and back and is infected with Ether.  Thor must now save Jane and all nine realms from the Dark Elves with the help of Loki.

The film has many great qualities.  The effects are amazing.  The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante.  The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building.  This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did.  The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves home world than on Earth which I was okay with.  I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun.  Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene.  The action is another thing that is upped in this film.  I also love the design of the Dark Elves.  I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard.  This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.

However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character.  There is really no character development in this show.  Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first.  Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow.  Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels.  However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that.  Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere.

Odin and Thors friends in Asghard are given even less to do than in the first film which is saying something.  Those characters did not get much to do in the first film, but I can kind of understand because the film is about Thor learning his lesson and about Lokis jealousy.  However, here they are given less to do which is a big missed opportunity.  I heard a lot was cut from this film, which might include more of Odin, Thors friends, and the villain, which the film needed.  I hope we get to see that footage when the film comes to DVD.

The villain is extremely boring and lazy as well.  He is probably the weakest kink in this film.  He is a generic villain that wants to destroy the world and the hero must stop him.  He has no dimension or charm like Loki does.  Compared to Loki in the first film and the Avengers this villain is weak.  Even in this film Loki is better, because you constantly question whether you can trust him.

Also, they threw in this very forced humor that does not work.  This mainly occurs when we are on Earth.  When we are on Asghard and the other realms the humor they had felt natural and was funny.  Occasionally you get a funny joke, but whenever we are on Earth we are treated to unfunny humor.  We had quite a bit of humor on Earth in the first Thor but, in my opinion, it was not as forced and was actually funny.  I feel that this becoming a thing with these Marvel movies, where they feel the need to through in forced and unnecessary humor.  The Iron Man sequels definitely have this problem.

Overall, Thor The Dark World is a very entertaining film.  There is not much dimension past the action and scope, but the characters are still likable and fun and the action and effects are breathtaking.  It is not quite as good as the first film, but is a good movie nonetheless.  I think it is definitely worth a viewing in the theatre.",1394841600,,4722,4.481220657276995
6084479,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Bringing modern day technical special movie effects in combination of a Mythical Realm, Asgard, was a kind of Sci-Fi Roman / Spartan flick.  Very entertaining!  Natalie Portman, although very beautiful, didn't play as much of a role than I had anticipated, but still a very exciting movie to watch. Although, she very much played her part well. I particular liked how the different realms were linked when the alignment occurred and how its affects were played out and taken advantage of throughout the battle.  Interesting angle on that phenomena.  That part was a nice surprise!",1394841600,,580,5.073684210526316

Such a great & exciting movie- I really enjoyed it but
can someone please explain the ending to me?
How did loki live after being killed?
and why did the collector need 5 of those ""red stone"" things at the end after the credits rolled?
won't thors father (the king) wonder why thor never returned since loki was cloaked as the king at the end?
if loki was evil, why didn't he just help destroy the worlds - why cloak as the king at the end after thor just finished saying he died with honor?

I grew up knowing little about thor the DC hero, and a bit more about the myth.  I didn't much care for the DC adaptation, so I knew fairly little about him.

This, however, was an extremely well done adaptation of Thor.  He's likable, experiences believable growth, and has the best qualities of a confident superhero.

Even after watching the movie multiple times you'll still never be able to fully answer whether Loki was working with Thor or against him.  Tom Hiddleston does a great job of making a villain that people love, hate, and in some ways can relate to (we all have a Thor type as a sibling right?).  Chris Hemsworth does another fantastic job of playing the overly moral and honest Thor with an added bonus of a great shirtless scene right at the beginning of the movie (if that doesn't captivate a girls interest, I don't know what would).  An exciting movie that has a little bit of something for everyone.",1394755200,,667,4.487603305785124

It's got a great blend of humor and drama, and the cast (all back from the first movie, plus some) are even better together this time around.  Tom Hiddleston continues to excel as Loki, and he and Chris Hemsworth (Thor) have such great chemistry together you almost wish everyone else would just be quite and let them roll.  But if THAT were the case you wouldn't get the great comic relief of Kat Dennings as Darcy - always a favorite! - who comes onto the scene bearing her own intern, played to adorable effect by Jonathan Howard.  Natallie Portman is even better as Jane this time around, IMO, and it's so nice to see her character get to experience a little bit of Asgard.",1394668800,,761,4.414285714285715

I got the iTunes version and that comes with extra features as well. The BD its self is good. The picture and sound are on par with other Marvel releases.

6084557,4,B00GLPCKX8,Fine for an action movie.  Enjoyed the CG and the general plot.  Bad guys were a bit wimpy and some of the plot specifics seemed contrived.  Overall pretty good though.,1394582400,,168,4.533333333333333

6084564,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I was not one for comic books when I was growing up but I have to say, with the world of special effects I have really come to appreciate the ""super hero"" genre. Thor has become one of my favorites so far and the story line between Thor and Natalie Portman is right on. I don't think anyone could have played Thor better then Chris Hemsworth, this is truly his calling. Because of Thor, I have come to appreciate The Avengers as well as Captain America. I look forward to further story lines with in Thor and The Avengers as long as they keep the same cast.",1394582400,,557,4.214953271028038

6084569,3,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie was cool; however, something I found totally distracting was how the Asgardians fought with swords and the bad guys had laser guns and this devastating grenade that makes people disappear. The grenade does not explode, but rather create this black hole that sucks the person into it. It's amazing to watch, but annoying when I realize that the Asgardians brought a sword to a laser black hole grenade fight.

Another thing that is weird is that these people are supposed to be the most powerful and wisest folks in the Universe; yet, their political system is based on blood. Why don't they have a democracy? It's so easy for Loki to take the throne, which is really disturbing. In case you did not know. He killed a lot of people in ""The Avengers.""

I feel like the Asgardians should have had democracy at least thousands of years ago and by now they should be at some more evolved system of government. The Asgardians are not innovative and probably should not be ruling the nine realms.

In addition, Asgardians talk a lot of s*** about how humans are like goats, but if you think about It, it took humans a few centuries to get democracy going, so we are not goats at all. Last time I checked goats are still eating grass and jumping off cliffs. Humans at least have the sense to liquefy grass and sell it for $3.

Anyway, I know it's not real, but s*** man. This was a movie that I really wanted to love. I conclude that Thor is not a superhero movie. This is a fantasy/science fiction film. It's King Arthur in space with black hole grenades.",1394582400,2,1559,4.47887323943662

6084580,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I was thrown the first time I saw it.  The trailer was misleading and I was not mentally prepared for this movie.  It was entertaining and action packed.  There were twists and turns the whole way through. I love Chris Hemsworth as Thor.  I am not, however, taken with Natalie Portman.  I think they could have done better with that one. I feel she is carried by stronger actors and lack the emotions needed to this part. If you liked the first Thor movie then watch the second but watch it twice before making up your mind.  They are very different movies.",1394582400,,557,4.411764705882353

Oscar is no where in sight from an acting angle.  There are magical bad elves and their friends.  There good guys and the good guys friends.  There are plenty of mindless yet rather bloodless fights.  Hell, it's a good old fashion romp through the nine realms.  Order the movie, sit back and enjoy close to two hours of entertainment.

I've heard some people complain about it being too much of a love story but I really enjoyed the way they did the show and thought there was plenty of action to keep you interested and make you not notice how much time has passed.

Definitely worth watching and the 3-D just adds to the special affects and appeal.",1394496000,,370,4.125

The Dark Elves want to steal the light from the universe and it needs, Thor, Loki (yes, Loki), Jane Foster, Prof. Selvig, Darcy and Ian the intern to stop them. So much fun. I won't say anything more....just this a great thrill ride and so much fun, the side humor is great, keep your eyes and ears open. Can I give this movie more than 5 stars?

6084609,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I will cut to the chase I liked this movie, and after three days I'm still thinking about it.
It reminded me of Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back, dark, heroic, struggle, love, rejection, envy and just the right amount of hope and of course a cliffhanger.
Let's face it, this is the story of a comic book hero and a Viking God, what a combination!
The movie is almost two hours long and you feel exhausted when it's over.
But it really is well done, without giving it away the way this movie goes from sheer tragedy to side splitting humor is remarkable. Even the the dynamic between Jane and Thor is hilarious at times. Then there is the tragic aspect, the fight and difficulty, it is not easy for Thor, he struggles in terms of power and intellect, you feel his emotions as he deals with the heavy responsibilities that have fallen on his shoulders.
Not your average 15 year old boy movie, very likable for all ages.
I hate cliffhangers but this one is tolerable.",1394496000,,965,4.426966292134831

Generally sequels can be on shaky ground, depending on how good the original was. I am happy to say that this movie is just as good, if not better than, the original.

My only complaint is that they should have used Kat Dennings more, because I love her, and find her to be hilarious. But, hey, we got a LOT of screen time with Natalie Portman, and that is almost as good!

Pretty much in a mirror flip from the first Thor movie, most of the movie takes place in Thor's realm/space, and very little of it takes place on Earth. I was happy with that, as I found a lot of the Earth-bound stuff from the original movie to be fairly boring.

I loved it, and I smiled ear to ear from beginning to end. Great job Marvel! I saw it in theaters. I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray immediately after. The cast is amazing and their gravitas carries a Shakespearean nobility with the strength of planets colliding. Also, this story helps build towards something bigger down the road, so retention to all of the Marvel movies is key to the exposition of the amazing-ness to come. Just the notion of Thor 1 and 2 makes me smile.",1394409600,,624,4.434782608695652
6084636,5,B00GLPCKX8,awesome sequel. stop making me type more to add a rating or I just won't do any more. bite me,1394409600,,93,3.7

6084638,5,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed this movie immensely there was plenty of action throughout and a great story line that kept you guessing till the end.,1394409600,,128,4.608695652173913
6084639,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I loved the first Thor. So when this came out I was so excited, but I think I may have got myself to worked up because this one just didn't have the magic the first one had.",1394409600,,173,3.7027027027027026
6084640,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I really liked it more than the 1st one. The action was better, the character interplay was more natural, and I liked the call backs to other characters that was included as well.

For me, it was better than the 1st and that's a rare thing.",1394409600,,240,4.217391304347826
6084641,5,B00GLPCKX8,"My husband and I were torn between 3 movies on pay-per-view and picked this one.  So good! Very fast-paced with good special effects and just the right amount of humor thrown in.  Don't quit watching after the credits again, as they always throw in something extra.  Last time we picked the Wolverine movie and it was good, but this one is better.",1394409600,,347,4.564516129032258
6084642,3,B00GLPCKX8,Not much to say.  Familiar and new characters but the excitement level was greatly decreased.  The plot was...hmmm...boring and almost predictable.  Nuff said.,1394409600,3,159,5.826086956521739
6084643,5,B00GLPCKX8,Way better than the first one... I actually loved Loki on this one. It's a great follow up to the avengers.,1394409600,,107,4.142857142857143
6084644,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Not bad, not great. I love Loki, wish he'd had more screen time and interaction. He makes Thor look like an idiot.",1394409600,,114,4.2272727272727275
6084645,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Aside from the female-baiting ab shots of Chris Hemsworth once again, this film does a great job, contains a lot of humor, and has a plot that rivals the best superhero films of the day. Marvel wisely, but not overbearingly, tied in ""New York"" (Avengers) and even contained a cameo of Captain America (Chris Evans). The special effects are amazing (pretty much par for the course these days), acting is well-done, storyline is consistent and tells a great tale of Asgard and their battles with forces outside the Nine Realms, etc. A very nice effort indeed and if you are a Thor fan and/or a fan of the Marvel Studios films, add this one to your library.",1394409600,,654,4.598290598290598

6084647,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Movie moved at a good pace. Story line was intreging. Showed even heroes have their weaknesses. Even in his, Thor was still able to accomplish his goals. Even ones without super strength were able to fill an important role, in over coming evil.",1394409600,,244,4.6976744186046515
6084648,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I enjoyed the storyline overall, and the action sequences & effects were quite good.  I do wish the Dark Elf history was developed more than it was, and just how they feuded with early Asgardians especially.
 I do not think the Tessaract & the Aether should be used in upcoming storyline as Infinity Gems.  The Collector's appearance in the movie end was an interesting addition as the so-called ""guardian"" of the two artifacts, but DEFINITELY NOT as the upcoming wielder of the Infinity Gauntlet, as that ownership belongs to Thanos alone, in my view.",1394409600,,552,4.851063829787234

6084653,3,B00GLPCKX8,Totally disappointed after watcHing this film. There is not much in this. Other than Chris there is nothing in it. The story line very weak.,1394409600,,140,4.64
6084654,3,B00GLPCKX8,The story line just wasn't that good.  I've begun to expect more from the Marvel series.  It wasn't a waste of time.,1394409600,,116,4.2272727272727275
6084655,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Disconnected plot, often times predictable. Terrible performances. Just felt that the director and some cast were bored making this movie. I fast forwarded through a half of the movie - it was that pathetic. I did like the first Thor. It was tight, had a rhythm and a flow. Add the performances were to match.",1394409600,,309,4.636363636363637
6084656,5,B00GLPCKX8,"A seriously more fun, better script, better acting all around! Especially compared to 1st Thor movie! Things just felt a lot more real. Dare I say as whole this movie was better than Avengers! There was a lot more emotions driving this film. The sadest moments in this film were more relatable, to the point where my wife actually shed tears in certain scenes! Avengers could not do that, it was too surreal! All in all great fun movie",1394409600,3,435,4.518987341772152

The movie was great.  Those Hemsworth men seem to come from an amazing gene pool.  I'm not really impressed with this version of the combo pack.  I wish a DVD was included.",1394409600,,455,4.2823529411764705
6084658,3,B00GLPCKX8,The movie started slow and finished strong; the ending was not expected.  The lead in could have been better prepared but other than that it kept your attention with plot and action.  Well worth the price,1394409600,,204,4.638888888888889

6084660,4,B00GLPCKX8,Pretty good. Classic Marvel film. Liked the fx. Hope to see a third installment. How did Loki kill Odin? Wow!,1394409600,,109,4.5
6084661,4,B00GLPCKX8,I enjoyed the first movie and wasn't sure what to expect from this one but watched it anyway. I'm glad I did. It was at least as good as the first...probably a little better,1394409600,,173,4.117647058823529
6084662,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Glad to see Loki back, I sincerely hope this means there will be more THOR movies in the future.  What are the chances of THOR showing up in Agents of Shield?",1394409600,,158,4.096774193548387

6084665,5,B00GLPCKX8,Chris hemsworth's voice in itself is what thor sounds like.  Great to see jane foster at her stubborn ways. And erik agter the new york attack kinda fits.  Was hoping shield would of at least came in for a storyline addition considering it takes place after the avengers... but whatever.  But....  Loki...... epic.,1394409600,,314,4.867924528301887

6084667,1,B00GLPCKX8,"No coherent plot.

Nothing makes sense or even leads you to believe they spent more than a few hours coming up with a script.

The special effects were pretty good but couldn't get more than halfway through it.",1394323200,5,210,4.5
6084668,5,B00GLPCKX8,I watch a lot of movies and like to collect all the worth while ones. This is a good one to have and arrived on time and  in great condition,1394323200,,140,3.6666666666666665
6084669,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I love Chris Hemsworth playing ""Thor"", but when they cast Tom Hiddleston as ""Loki"", that was putting the icing on the cake. They both play there parts well, but I would say that the movie wouldn't have been quite as good with someone else playing ""Loki"". Tom gives the character just the right flavor of evil with a dash of goodness. The first movie was ""Thors"", but I have to give this movie to ""Loki"".",1394323200,,403,4.386666666666667
6084670,4,B00GLPCKX8,I liked this second Thor movie every bit as much as the first one.  I recommend it. Great story line as well.,1394323200,,109,3.9545454545454546

6084673,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Gonna have to admit, I have very little clue as to the plot of this film.  My husband assures me that there WAS one...I can only assume he was actually listening to what the characters were saying.
All I could hear (in my mind) was that ridiculous song, ""Oh, yeah."" from the 80's any time Thor, Loki or Mendel were on screen.  Lol.",1394323200,,331,4.238095238095238
6084674,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Boring movie with stuff flying around. The music is consistently triumphant and the graphics make it confusing and monotonous. Natalie Portman is hot but plays the same ""seduced"" role with EVERYBODY in the movie.",1394323200,,212,5.264705882352941
6084675,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Good action movie ,overall worth watching a couple time to catch the super fast action ,that takes away some from the movie ,but other then that great pop corn movie ,I thought the ending for the bad guy could have been done a little different,and the way it was ended with Loki really left the movie where your guessing on what happened . But the action does make up for it,i would watch it again.",1394323200,,398,4.32
6084676,5,B00GLPCKX8,Really enjoyed this movie. So sad to see the queen pass. Loki on the throne...where is the king? Ready for the next one!!!,1394323200,,122,4.3478260869565215
6084677,5,B00GLPCKX8,"No this isn't a movie about Tuners racing around the city.  THOR the God of Thunder is back and trying to get his brother Loki to straighten out his act and do the right thing.  To like us mere mortals on planet earth, when we get invaded by these Hate filled aliens who wish to kill the human race and strip our planet of all that is good who will rescue the earthlings.....buy it and find out 3D is amazing",1394323200,,408,4.0875
6084678,2,B00GLPCKX8,Another boring overly visually hyped action movie. The first Thor had a storyline that made it somewhat entertaining. This is just cashing in on the success of The Avengers and pumping out sub-par movies with storylines that drive purely action sequences.,1394323200,,255,5.2439024390243905

6084689,4,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie had all of the elements we love (well written scenes, action and good vs. evil, of course). The only part of this movie we didn't like-Natalie Portman's character. She screamed or just stood there looking stunned more than she spoke during the entire movie. She is supposed to be an extremely intelligent scientist but in this movie she was just there to look pretty. It was quite annoying. That is the only issue we had with the movie. Thank goodness for Loki-he stole the show and kept us entertained throughout the movie.",1394323200,,535,4.702127659574468

6084704,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor: The Dark World has as empty a plot, and shallow of character development as any bad summer Blockbuster ever made.  The most impressive thing about this film is its heaping piles of CGI animated characters, explosions, space ships and the like.  Some of the designs are aesthetically interesting.  It is all Nordic gods in space, with a dash of Lord of the Rings.  None of the action sequences are particularly noteworthy or memorable.  Fight scenes aren't especially well choreographed.  It lacks Joss Whedon's witty repartee.  It doesn't take itself seriously, but then it isn't really funny either.",1394323200,4,606,5.122448979591836
6084705,5,B00GLPCKX8,This Thor combo pack was able to be used on my Vudu for the digital copy.  Great movie!!!  Highly recommended!,1394236800,,110,4.45
6084706,3,B00GLPCKX8,"And they were..zipping through Asgard in an alien ship and destroying just about every structure's support was fun.  I kept waiting for the buildings to fall....unfortunately they didn't.  The ending fight scene was great too..zipping through different worlds while Thor's Hammer gets a tour of its own.  Watching Thor get beat up and come back even stronger was pretty cool too.

But that's it folks.  There is no plot (or maybe there was but it was left on the cutting room floor).  There is no chemistry between Thor and Jane who takes a massive backseat in this movie....most of the time she's passed out or about to pass out.  She's awfully quiet for 90% of the film and forget that she's supposed to be a brilliant physicist except when it comes to the ending scenes..of which I'm not exactly sure what she was doing...and I don't think the writer's knew either---it showed.  She seems to be a placeholder for more CGI action scenes than anything else.  As for villians?  Um....were there villians in this movie?  Hard to tell because they certainly didn't occupy much screen time (other than pounding Thor into the ground that is).

The only interaction that was of any interest was between Thor and Loki....and even then it felt rushed.  Actually, that sums up the entire movie---rushed to get to the next fight sequence.  Yes the characters were ""developed"" in the first movie, but instead of expanding upon that development, the writers resisted and simply moved the characters through different paces.

Someone also commented about this being simply a next installment in a series, but if it were a book, it would be considered less than middle of the road.  Really, there is nothing here except great fight scenes.  If you are looking for anything more into Marvel's Thor mythology, read the comic books instead.",1394236800,4,1824,4.87012987012987
6084707,5,B00GLPCKX8,It was just as good as I thought it would be...jk it was better. This was Scyfy and sexy all in one. I love how they tie in the avengers too. Awesome effects and a good mix of humor with seriousness. Ah-mazing !,1394236800,,211,3.9302325581395348

Be sure watch the Mid-Credits scene and the After-Credit scene.,1394236800,,278,4.470588235294118
6084712,2,B00GLPCKX8,"I have the feeling that Thor just went through the ropes knowing it would make big bucks when it came out.  The first one was very good and it showed heart and a sense of humor.  This was simply another lame knock off and it showed that the directorial staff was phoning it in.  The warriors 3, an integral part of the first movie were hardly seen and were it not for Loki this movie would have been one of the year's worst.  No this is a movie you can certainly pass on and lose nothing.",1394236800,2,488,4.052083333333333

I hate this.",1394236800,3,561,4.446601941747573
6084717,4,B00GLPCKX8,I liked this movie although I wished Thor and Jane went a bit further in declaring their feelings.  I really liked the scene with Thor's mom.  I would have liked to see the Jane being more involved in the fighting scenes.  Loki is awesome as always!  I don't think the writing did a great job showing Thor's transition away from being king.  Looking forward to the next movie in the Marvel franchise.,1394236800,,400,4.5

6084731,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor: The Dark World...ah, what a waste! You could've been (should've been) much more. Alas, this very dry sequel is unfortunately what we get. I saw it in the movies when it came out and was thoroughly disappointed by the whole affair. After viewing it again--my opinion hasn't changed one bit. Let me start by saying, I'm a huge comic book fan especially Marvel. So seeing these wonderful characters I grew up with finally in big budget, wide screen 3D glory is beyond belief! I really enjoyed Ken Branagh's first one. It had it's silly moments but was very well made (for what it is--a comic book film). And it didn't hurt that Branagh was fan of the character himself and was smart enough to pick a fine cast. Now, here we are with T:TDW, and although also a well made ""comic book film"" compared to first one something is definitely missing in the formula. Alan Taylor did a fine job directing, Hemsworth is excellent (he official owns this character--at least for now), Hiddleston is...well Hiddlston (you can't touch him--he will forever be Loki), all the actors portraying the Warriors 3 and Sif are great (wish there was more for them to do). And thank God for Kat Dennings (""Look, it's Mew-Mew!"") that's all I have to say. She kept it funny and fresh. My biggest problem (performance wise) was with Natalie Portman. Usually a very fine actor, I wasn't nuts about her in Thor, but her Jane Foster seemed more kind and scientifically curious (which she should be considering she's a physicist) even though I never bought her ""romantic interest"" in Thor there is absolutely NO HEAT between these two actors (it's like a brother and sister making out). And that hasn't changed for sequel. Throughout the film she seemed to be in foul mood, short tempered and pushy. I can understand her slapping Loki but why Thor? It's not cute or funny--I mean c'mon, we know you like the guy...he saved your bacon two yrs earlier and saved Earth from an interstellar invasion. You don't hug him or kiss him? You slap him? What kind of of girlfriends or wives the screenwriters have? When Thor transports her Asgard Portman acts like someone who just took an elevator ride to 4th floor--not a physicist who just used an Einstein-Rosen bridge to travel several million light years in a minute!!! And she's being examined by superbeings, surrounded by superbeings and Odin himself walks in the room and she's unflustered by his presence even snappy! It didn't feel right to me--came off a little disjointed (heard there was some tension on set between Nat, Marvel and Taylor--maybe?) speaking of which, Sir Tony (one of my all time favorite actors) looked BORED TO DEATH! He looked like he wished in was doing a sequel to Remains of the Day, Howard's End or Nixon than playing in 'thy mother's drapes'. No chemistry between him or Chris or Tom when they had scenes together. What a waste. And poor Chris Eccleston--kinda wish ya stayed as The Doctor a few more season, eh? Unfortunately, I hate to repeat myself--but it does bare repeating Thor: The Dark World could've been and should've been a worthy sequel to one of Marvel's greatest characters. Just bring back Kat for Thor 3 and I'll show up...maybe.",1394236800,5,3194,4.73608617594255

I like the fact that this episode explored Loki n Thor s mom n dad dynamics as a family. Grt special effects. Soooo, can someone tell me, how did Loki pull off impersonating Odin? What happened to Odin? I'm loving Idris Elba even more! The whole cast played well as an ensemble. Glad to watch in my home now whnever I want, thks amazon.com",1394150400,,491,4.406593406593407

Thor:The Dark World seems like it's just a small step in-between Avengers movies. You don't emphasize at all with the villain (a real waste of Christopher Eccleston's acting skills) and never really get a sense of a character behind him. He feels cookie cutter and half-thought-out.",1394150400,5,410,5.134328358208955

Chris Hemsworth is an EXCELLENT Thor, however, Loki stole the show!!  Anyway, I'm not a big theater goer, BUT, this was a movie I would have liked to have seen on the big screen.  But I digress, I waited for it to come out on DVD, and thanks to Amazon, I got to see it the very day it was released!!  Good plot, good humor.  It's a fun movie for those of us who want to get lost in a world of make-believe.  If you can suspend your sense of reality for a while, this is a good movie to get lost in.  Again, though, Loki just makes the movie.  Tom Hiddleston relishes his role and it is totally obvious!  He makes it a fun ride. I totally enjoyed this movie!!  :-)",1394150400,,804,4.089743589743589

But I thought it was a fun ride of a comic book film, Hemsworth & Hiddleston have grown in their roles as Thor & Loki & share a  charming chemistry with each other, that gives you the feeling that they really are brothers. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster is also great adding that romantic element, along with the magic meets sci-fi adventure. For those that complained that there wasn't enough of Asgard in the first film, you won't be disappointed this time around. The golden city looks beautiful & there are peeks at some of the other nine realms as well. Although it was great to have a touch of Walt Simonson's classic characters added, Malekith & the Dark Elves were a little disappointing as the villains. As for the Blu-ray extras; Ben Kingsly is hilarious in the one shot mini movie, which might satisfy a few of the Mandarin haters. The gag reel also really shows that the cast & crew had a great time making ""The Dark World"".",1394150400,,1097,4.540404040404041

It stayed true to the story of Thor and i believe the director captured it beautifully, Chris Helmsworth did a great job in this role, i think he captured the very essence of Thor.  I could watch this movie over and over and being on Blu-ray makes it even better.  My kids make a competition out of seeing who can find Stan Lee first, we all know he is in there.

We had a chance to see The Queen in Action! She was superb! Thor was still powerful with those huge pythons swinging his hammer! He was finally reunited with his love interest!  We had a chance to see more action from Heimdall.  The evil portrayed was more ferocious!  Each character had a chance to do more and present more of themselves.  The only thing I didn't understand was after the credits there was a scene that looked more comical than expected.

As a lead-up to something or a transitional piece, it seemed fantastic but hardly necessary as a standalone movie. Maybe this is just the way-of-things in a world where these comic universes must find a way to stitch together multiple story lines. Even with all the build up, the Dark Elves seemed hardly threatening when defeated by a mere science project.

In this movie, Natalie Portman just didn't come through.  Not just with the male lead, but the other characters as well.  There was no depth to her character.  I don't know if that is because of the way the script was written or her acting just wasn't there.  It came across as if she was locked into acting in this movie and had to ""bore"" her way through it.  Chris Hemsworth was awesome!  I believe he really portrayed the character of Thor well.  There was depth and relation to the other characters just like in the first movie. Because this is a sequel, constancy of the characters from the previous movie is really important.  It can make or break a movie.  Areas that are weak in the movie are the role of Jane and transition from the previous movie to this movie.",1394064000,,908,4.4156626506024095

6084782,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I think out of all the marvel universe films the Thor series is the most underrated. Hemsworth and Hopkins both are excellent as well as the other supporting actors, comic relief is kinda dull compared to the other marvel films but the story and hype more than makes up for it. So other than that the only other dislike I had was the some of clich story narratives that weren't really executed well either, but it didn't make the film unbearable.

As for streaming rental which I did, it was fast and did not buffer once.",1394064000,,521,4.427083333333333

6084786,4,B00GLPCKX8,"This was a fun movie to watch. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I didn't like some characters they killed off. They could have made it fun without doing that. Otherwise, pretty action packed with good special effects. From the ending, I'd say there will be another one coming too.",1394064000,,288,4.452830188679245
6084787,5,B00GLPCKX8,"If you're looking at this product, you've probably already decided you want the movie, you just need to know if this is the right version.

First, the blu-ray version is quite good. Clean transfer, sharp and crisp. The audio is good, I could hear everything clearly on my TV's small speakers, which isn't always the case.

Second, the special features are great. I particularly want to call out the director's commentary which has the cinematographer, producer Kevin Feige, and actor Tom Hiddleston with him. While they occasionally lapse into describing the action, the commentary is chalk full of discussions about how they made things and why they decided to do what they did. Having such a wide variety of opinions from multiple points of view was great.

You get your choice of digital copies. I chose the iTunes version, which was HD as well. On my Apple TV, I was able to choose from different languages and it had chapters like most iTunes moves do today. Also, with this movie, you get the iTunes extras on your computer. iTunes extras are the special features you'd get on the blu-ray, except for audio commentary. Specifically, the iTunes extras had the Marvel One-Shot All Hail the King (which is awesome, btw), all the featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, and the gag reel.",1394064000,2,1291,4.859090909090909

6084793,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor is one of my favorite comic heroes, but this story is convoluted and campy at times.

6084800,5,B00GLPCKX8,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie in theatres and of course wanted to add it to my growing collection of Super Hero films. Definitely left me interested to see what happens next. Purchasing on Amazon seems to always be the best deal especially since this package includes a digital copy so I can watch it on my mobile device. For value I can't seem to find a better option.,1394064000,,370,4.455882352941177

6084802,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor takes you for an unrelenting action adventure experience!  Loki provides a performance worthy of award consideration; his character and his character's ""talents"" provide some fun twists to this story and perhaps more.  A number of scenes will remind you of other films - Star Wars for one - and aside from Loki acting is notably missing from the formula, but hey, its an action movie and even if ideas are borrowed the presentation is spectacular.  The visual fun escalates this movie from a 2.5 to a 4.25 movie - and to me anything over a 3.5 in this genre is worth watching.",1394064000,,581,4.621359223300971

There are some dynamic actors that I would have liked to have heard more from, with the exception of Thor's father. He is great in whatever role he plays. Loki is always a character that you love to hate and much enjoyed and what woman who is still converting oxygen to carbon dioxide doesn't like to see Chris Hemsworth with his shirt off. I would like to see further development of the romantic element and it's always fun to watch women in action and not cowering behind someone. Accepting protection is great, and appreciated, but seeing strength of character in the heroine is always inspiring.",1394064000,,668,4.669491525423729

Special effects were brilliant, a perfect blending of Sci-Fi and Fantasy.  Humanizing the Asgardians really made the movie richer for me.

the ONLY negative (and its a tiny one), classic good vs evil aside, is that all the Marvel movies seem to immediately gravitate to the ""Intergalactic-Evil-Destroying-The-Planet"" thing.  You guys are gonna jump the shark on that pretty soon.",1394064000,,532,5.011363636363637

Personally, I agreed with Odin when he told Thor that he should have taken a look at Sif for his mate; they had more in common.  On the subject of Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth dressed as Thor gets a 20 on a scale of 1-5 from me every time!  Blonde hair and blue eyes, in general, is not my style, but when I saw the previews of the first movie, I made an exception!  Whew, too hot!!  I would have enjoyed a few more scenes containing his buddies, but I get that the storyline needed to move on.  I just got the Blu-ray disc last week and have already viewed it twice (I would have viewed it more, but I also purchased the digital version that is on my Kindle that I have viewed 3 times).

Dont let that keep you from watching this movie. The movie is much better than some of the other Marvel heroes.",1393977600,,303,4.527272727272727
6084865,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Awesome movie!!! It had great special effects. Good plot, great acting. I would definitely recommend seeing the first Thor and Avengers movie first before seeing this if you haven't already.

6084870,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Lots of action,  and plenty of humor. The few things I didn't like we're how close the humorous scenes were to the tragedies.  There wasn't much time to mourn or be sad before something funny would happen. And the mid credits scene could have been fine at the end of the credits.
The loki and thor scenes were best.  Chris and Tom feed off each other. Unfortunately Natalie Portman didn't get much action, but she looked gorgeous passed out (80% of the film she was). Kat Dennings did a great job of being quirky and just.. well, Darcy, with the few scenes she had.
Much of the film takes place in other realms as opposed to just midguard (earth). The story of the Dark Elves was intriguing but a bit ambiguous.  Luckily Anthony Hopkins make it work using his talent through his voice.  There was not much time with Odin, but a big enough impression was made each scene to give a decent dose of the Allfather.",1393977600,,909,4.419161676646707

6084885,2,B00GLPCKX8,"I absolutely love Chris Hemsworth. He is so hot, I once thought I could enjoy a Razzie-worthy movie as long as he was in it.  Boy was I wrong. This movie was too boring to be so long. I fell asleep around the one hour mark. The plot was weak, the movie needed more Midgard overlap and did I mention it was too long. I know Thor is not one of more beloved popular characters, but please write a decent script. I would advise Marvel to nix the next Thor movie and portray him in more ensemble movies. Although I didn't care for the movie, I still love Chris...two stars.",1393977600,5,568,4.163636363636364

6084896,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Just that simple...... I was very hesitant to spend my $$ on the first one and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The Dark World had maybe 1 or 2 moments but the rest seemed like filler and a little slow. If this is your kind of thing you'll probably like it.....If not... wait for it to come out on Prime.

6084904,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I liked the original Thor, this continued on a lot of the things that were good in the first. Apparently that Japanese actor was expensive because he was in the movie for like 3 seconds tops. Is it just me or do modern comic movies have no sense of loss, just killing off characters that result in a ""well that sucks"" scene.  Digital version was crisp which is not a given when streaming.",1393891200,,388,4.315068493150685

I fully realize the title of the movie is ""The Dark World"" but I literally could not see most of the dark parts. I don't know if it is because of my TV, but I was playing with it the entire length of the movie and could not get it to the point where I was comfortable watching it. However, this was the only issue I had with the movie, other than that I fully enjoyed it, and the Exclusive bonus feature was great.",1393891200,,506,3.875
6084907,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I wondered how they would continue too make Thor-related movies and this film shows me how and why.

Add former stars like Anthony Hopkins as the aging King and the audience may feel gratified that this movie has some meat about it, but alas, that proves not to be the case in the end and when you are done watching it you see it as fluff with great CGI and some really nasty characters.",1393891200,,387,4.22972972972973

Too much was left on the cutting room floor, I think.  Natalie Portman, just meh...I don't think action movies are her strong point. She & Hemsworth didn't have any real chemistry. Overall, for an action super hero film, it is what it is, you're not expecting Oscar material here. Worth renting for popcorn flick.",1393891200,,475,4.642857142857143

6084922,3,B00GLPCKX8,the movie was actually pretty good up until the end in the ending was kinda weak you didn't really uh take me any place of mentally or morally or spiritually and I felt it should have been longer on that would have probably made it a little bit better but killing the bad guy at the end like that that was it was weak but overall it was a good movie,1393891200,,349,3.9295774647887325
6084923,2,B00GLPCKX8,"As a former avid Marvel comic reader (1960s-1970s), I thought the plot was weak and Odin was portrayed as less than majestic. Thor was good but he was limited by the adversaries as to what he could do. Don't make Thor look weak vis a vis his opponents.
As far as the bonus feature, I found the language offensive and I turned it off. Had I known that this was the case, I would not have purchased the movie.

6084926,3,B00GLPCKX8,"While I really enjoyed the first movie of this franchise, I was much less impressed with this one.  The villain's motivation to destroy the world was unclear to me, and the ""rules"" of how everything worked seemed completely arbitrary.  I guess I want to say that it wasn't good science fiction.  In addition, I didn't feel that any of the characters were developed enough to make me feel for any of them or to really care what happened to them.  Everything was just muddy.  I kept finding myself saying, ""What happened?"" and ""Why did she do that?""  Even the romantic aspect of this film was lacking to me.  There were moments, but they just weren't compelling.

I'm sure that people who enjoy comic-book movies would still find this film worth seeing, but I don't think any of them would consider it a classic or something they'd ever feel the need to watch over again.",1393891200,2,869,4.597402597402597

While the ending was a bit of a surprise it was, as in the 1st film, confusing. There weren't any answers to plot turns from first film and you're sort of dumped into deep end of the 'current"" time line and forced to swim to edge of the pool to catch up. Natalie Portman has no emotional investment in this film at all. Surprising with all her talent her character was so distant when Thor's mother dies protecting her. Kinda cold..maybe a Frost Giant bit her?",1393891200,2,608,4.486486486486487

6084951,2,B00GLPCKX8,The story was very boring and tedious - I fell asleep and had to back it up and re-watch what I missed.  The only thing that saved this was the special effects which were decent.  Chris Hemsworth was okay but I think they should have picked someone larger in stature to play the part of Thor.  I will probably receive a lot of flack for writing this but I thought Natalie Portman's performance was sub par.  I found her acting to be robotic like she was just reciting the script to get her part over with.  Part of my opinion could be based on the fact I think she is simply relying on past performances that she has been hailed for.  I think she is getting to the point of over exposure.  maybe she should take a break and wait for a role where she can really show some talent for acting. She was probably picked for this role to try and get more people interested and to cover for a lack luster story.,1393891200,2,903,4.155172413793103

6084968,5,B00GLPCKX8,"hello all
Well this past week i got to see the second of marvels Phase two movie plan with the release of Marvels Thor the Dark world. And let me say i liked it alot. This movie continue thors story from the avengers and reveals alot of what happened after Thor went back to Asgard. I won't spoil anything for you all but it is a great movie and i have to say alot better than the first. Here is my breakdown:

the good
This movie answered alot of questions that had been lingering since avengers. We get to know what happened between jane and thor, what punishment did loki get, what happened when the tesseract was returned, what about some of the other realms, what about selvig and darcy these all get answered. the action is fast paced when it gets started and it also leaves alot open for a third thor movie. Loki is as evil as ever and the growth of thor from the avengers continues. Before he was a child in avenges you saw him grow up a little in this one you see him mature to something even more mature sometimes than odin. Also the secret scenes are a treat for marvel fans The extras are good especially the inside look at Captain America:The Winter Soldier and the marvel one shot all hail the king, the rest is the usual gag reel, deleted scenes, scoring the movie. But the treat for thor fans will be thor and Loki blood bothers. Which is a look inside loki and thor and their relationship and how it has evolved so far.

the bad
first for a ancient species like the asgard to not have better defenses seems a little out there during some of the scenes. Secondly odin got on my nerves a bit sometimes, also i was expecting more evil from loki

in closing
this is a good movie that has alot of replay value and alot to love about it.",1393891200,,1748,4.227544910179641
6084969,5,B00GLPCKX8,The only thing I was disappointed about was the sound track otherwise can't wait for the next one. Love Thor!,1393891200,,109,4.5
6084970,5,B00GLPCKX8,Great story line with highly impressive acting.  The special effects and the action were in my opinion amongst the best that I've seen in a while.  The movie held my attention from beginning to end.,1393891200,,198,4.628571428571429
6084971,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Great movie, most sequels don't live up to the first...this one definitely does!  You will not be disappointed with Thor.",1393891200,,121,5.05
6084972,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I love the marvel movies. But Thor gets a three only because the Dark World was too dark. Many of the action scenes are in fact so dark the are almost UN-viewable.
I'd lighten up and give it 4 stars if they would have lightened up to let us watch it.
Also don't stop at the end credits, watch the little hidden scenes at the end.",1393891200,2,329,4.0

6084974,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor and Loki are both enjoyable characters on screen, and they are almost enough it fill a movie on their own, but the rest of this movie is a mess. The plot makes very little sense and the bad guys are completely forgettable.  For some reason, Oden comes across as weak and petty rather powerful and wise.  The scenes on earth are much more interesting than the other realms, which are lifeless husks of worlds...each world is all surface layer. Even Thor's home world seems uninhabited.  I really like Natalie Portman, but her acting here is closer to her acting in the Star Wars prequels (very awkward and wooden) than any of her better movies.

Thor and Loki are at their best when on Earth, playing super-human fish out of water. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen this time around.  I suppose that is the threat of Marvel's grand scheme to unite all the plots- some movies are going to feel more like subplots in the overall scheme. Hopefully things are righted for the third Thor movie!",1393804800,2,1001,4.6647727272727275

6084976,3,B00GLPCKX8,Enjoyable but not as good as the first in this series. Lots of information holes for episodes yet to come,1393804800,,105,4.3
6084977,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I struggled through the first one as I'm not big on the whole ""other world"" aspect of Thor with strange humanoid or otherwise type characters. However, like the Avengers movie I love it when the action centres around Earth.

Thor and Loki interplay well together with some very funny moments added in. Natalie Portman surprises me that she features in these, but hey, they are such profitable movies, why not. And Robert Redford is starring in the next Captain America, so everyone is after a super heroes gig now.

Lots of good action, some romance and good visual effects make this fun to watch.",1393804800,,597,4.730769230769231
6084978,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Lame, stupid, just flat out corny movie.  I sat through this at home after getting it at  REDBOX.  Kids may dig this if they are really board.  We were very disappointed in this one too.  Hopefully we will have the HULK smashing things up this Summer.  Rent this if you need to, don't buy it,not worth it.",1393804800,3,305,4.2631578947368425

There are other more creative ways to introduce a character then using nudity.  If these scenes were not added to the movie I would give it a five star but since the makers chose a vulgar route I give it two stars.  Maybe the next film will be less tacky in content?

After reading how movies are rated maybe the ratings should be changed to any nudity is for X movies only.  The movie ratings link I read is at www dot mpaa dot org slash ratings slash what dash each dash rating dash means.",1393804800,,634,4.1138211382113825

6085009,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This is my favorite of the Marvel comic movies by far! It is very well done, great action, and a fun movie.  It has a feel kind of like Star Wars meets Lord if the Rings. Highly recommend it!",1393804800,,191,3.8974358974358974
6085010,4,B00GLPCKX8,"This was a great film.  I loved the humor and it definitely left me wanting more.  The Avengers really set the bar high for the other films that follow or surround it, however, this sequel was better than the first, and I really enjoyed the first as well!",1393804800,,255,4.291666666666667

6085013,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I liked the first Thor, I liked the second, but it isn't going to blow anybody away...

I would say that the visuals seemed a little too Star Wars-ish with how the CG and audio editing was done.  I felt like I was on Naboo, not Asgard.  I wish they had done a better job of developing the feel of the other-worldishness of the planets in the storyline.  The loss of a sense of place really was a detriment to the story telling.

But, overall, it was an enjoyable movie",1393804800,,468,4.155555555555556
6085014,1,B00GLPCKX8,Poor storyline and bad acting...we were every disappointed!! the movie was slow and not enough action and the beginning made no scene,1393804800,2,133,5.090909090909091

6085016,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor has never been one of my favorites.  At all.  Then, I took a chance on the first one, and I loved it.  Here we go with the second, and it seemed to be more indepth.  Thor's lady friend, Jane Foster, stumbles upon an entity and, inadvertantly, releases it.  The bad guys, let by Malekith and his army, sense the entity and want to claim it and use against Asgard.  Thor, being who he is, plans to stop the army, but needs help.  He recruits Loki, his hateful step-brother, to put a halt to the plans.  Asgard has never looked better, and the actors involved did their parts, including the actor who played Loki.  He brought a substance to him that was missing in the first flim.  If you get this, please let the DVD run, because what come up, to me, is a set-up for THOR 3.",1393804800,,777,4.1891891891891895
6085017,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I found this movie, while not epic, very entertaining.  It could have had more of a story instead of simply preparing for us for another sequel.  But, I did find the pace fast enough, the story O.K., the action interesting and fun, and the movie to be very entertaining.  Parts of it were very humorous (intentionally).  I don't want this review to have spoilers, but I do recommend this movie if you simply want to watch an entertaining action movie without much thought.",1393804800,,472,4.650602409638554
6085018,5,B00GLPCKX8,"really enjoyed seeing the cast together again. i like the on screen chemistry between Natalie and Chris and hoping for at least 1 more Thor movie. also thought it was good to see a deeper development of Loki's character. i have already watched it several times and so has my 6 year old grandson. was glad to see Darcy expanded as well.
i think it's great to be able to watch a movie that isn't filled with nudity and swearing.",1393804800,,426,4.3375
6085019,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Probably Hemsworth's best work to date. Really enjoy the action sequences, the plot with lots of great twists and turns, along with great CGI. Absolutely worth the price.

6085039,4,B00GLPCKX8,"One of the few Marvel films I didn't rush to see in a theater. Not for lack of interest, but more for bad timing. Anyway, I bought the Blu Ray as soon as it came available and while this is a very good sequel, it actually could have been a little longer because I think there were certain characters and certain plot points that could have been explained of fleshed out more. 10 additional minutes would have been enough time to do this.

As far as the Blu Ray release is concerned, aside from the film looking and sounding great, I found it to be very bland, not much in the way of extras and it seems now we won't be getting any fancy sleeves unless we buy the 3D version of the film, I also do not like that there is no Blu Ray DVD combo available, It's not like they dropped the price, they just dropped the DVD part. The extras on this product are really pretty desperate. I liked the short 2 part Thor feature-ette, but the first part was about the first film, why is it here? What is here is OK, but there isn't all that much. Sneak peaks for other films are not bonus material, but I did enjoy the sneak Peak for the new Captain America film.",1393804800,,1150,4.133928571428571

Of the movies Thor and Loki are featured in, my favorite with a 5 star was the Avengers and the first Thor ranking last for viewer prospects.",1393804800,,359,4.264705882352941
6085041,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Taking up where the previous film left off, we find Loki didn't die and Thor reconnects with Jane in an unexpected way. The Dark World makes us realize that there is more going on in the world than can be discerned by the normal human. Watched the film more than five times and have actually lost count. Worth the viewing and listening to the commentary.",1393804800,,354,4.461538461538462
6085042,4,B00GLPCKX8,This is a great continuation in the Marvel line of super heroes movies.  Continues the series in admirable fashion and makes me look forward to more from them.,1393804800,,159,4.678571428571429
6085043,4,B00GLPCKX8,Was never really into Thor as far as super heros go but the Thor movies have made me a fan. The dark world is a dark story but that's what makes this one a good movie. Add some humor here and there and your in for a fun movie.,1393804800,,226,3.63265306122449

6085067,3,B00GLPCKX8,I wouldn't care to own this movie but I enjoyed watching the movie. Not quite as dynamic as many of the super hero movies out today but a good choice when you've seen everything else that's been recently released.,1393804800,,213,4.487179487179487

6085070,4,B00GLPCKX8,"First off, having grown up reading comics, I love seeing my favorite heroes come to life on the big screen! I like a good story too, and I could understand the basic premise of this sequel. It was good to see Thor in his own movie outside the realm of Shield and the other Avengers (although the scene with Cap was clever!) With this movie, you can tell that Marvel is starting to expand their universe and incorporating more characters from that universe into more storylines. All and all a great movie. Can't wait for the next Avengers!",1393804800,,538,4.5

6085073,1,B00GLPCKX8,"The current, sweetly, computer animated remakes of Marvel comics into films are great.  As has been the case previously with this franchise, the crafting of this film technically was beautiful....and that was it.  The entire remainder of the film from plot, to premise to acting seemed to fall back on the wow of the tech aspects and beautiful CGI.  From the opening scenes rushed and shallow narrative, it never gained any more substance, momentum or apparent thought behind it's choices.  I'm all for a fun film that is full of improbabilities, but give it some effort and don't expect the audience to sit there stunned by fantastic landscapes while Natalie Portman looks like the some cute boy is winking at her just of camera and Anthony Hopkins phones in voice over lines while unsuccessfully concealing his desire to get back to anything other than this project.

In these times of excellent CGI I don't know why they decided to neuter all the characters -I would have loved to have seen a magical duel between Loki and Malekith.  I also would have liked to have seen a better fight between Kurse and Thor.  I'm not a superman fan but I watched Man of Steel before going to the theater to see this movie and in comparison the fight scenes in Dark World are paltry.  A lot of Thor fans were praising this film but I get the impression that they do so only in an attempt to raise sales.,1393718400,2,564,4.242990654205608

I can't imagine a better Thor than Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston is so funny and devious as Loki. A villain you want to root for. Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is a bit boring and a waste of time. I think more time would be much better spent on Jaime Alexander and her Lady Sif.

I can't tell who is the evil elf and who is the asgaard person. weird ship things keep flying everywhere, things appear from other dimensions, the character are giving each other meaningless looks all the time, and, perhaps worst of all, the actors are slurring their words and mumbling (even anthony hopkins). like they all were trying to fit into the special effects. there is no charisma here. in one scene loki screams at his mother about odin ""he's not my father!"" like a bad scene in an acting class. nothing real is happening between the actors. but i paid for it, so let's see what happens. that's real, that i paid 5 bucks to see it on amazon. an episode of all in the family is a lot better. i don't think archie would have liked this film ""geeze, there, what the hell is everyone doing in this picture! it's like the knights uh da round table in space. edith, where's the remote?""",1393718400,3,1480,4.5055762081784385

Some stuff just doesn't translate to film. People take these movies way too seriously. It's just supposed to be fun and I had a lot of fun watching this movie.

The Walter Simonson run is the definitive run on the Thor comic. So the fact that both movies drew from the Simonson run was an added bonus for me. Then there's Tom Hiddleston crushing as Loki again. Marvel has done a really good job finding just the right actors to bring these characters to life. It was awesome seeing the Thor/Loki/Odin dynamic up on the big screen.

6085145,4,B00GLPCKX8,"If you're reading this perhaps you're curious about the 3D. Stop,keep reading don't look down or up at the next review. Click on me.
Are you still here?.......Good.

Awhile back I posted a review for the first Thor film. I loved the movie but loathed the 3D transfer. Considering it was a film made by the all mighty powers at Disney/Marvel I was horrified at how bad it looked in 3D.
Lets now fast forward to 2014 and here we are now with Thor: The Dark World. I was really hesitant to buy this. Sure The Avengers had a great 3D transfer but perhaps that would prove to be the diamond in the rough?
I can say with full confidence and joy that Thor 2 in 3D looks wicked good and isn't plagued with any of the problems the first film had (in regards to 3D).
Visually, The Dark World even without  3D is a gorgeous affair. Asgard looks vibrant and enchanting. On a purely visual level it leaves you begging to see more of the thunder gods home world. Then when you add that 3D layer on top of it,this ends up being a real knockout to look at. A few scenes really do look striking in 3D,while the rest is a very serviceable transfer that's sure to make most of us 3D buffs happy.

If you want my quick opinion on the movie itself I really enjoyed it,though I felt Malekith was kind of thrown in their as nothing more but a plot point, and to give Thor someone to fight just for the sake of fighting. I thought the further developments with Loki were awesome and that Tom Hiddleston stole the show.

Botton line: Thor: The Dark World Triumphs were the original film failed with it's 3D conversion,and on top of that this is a great sequel as well. definitely worth the 3D purchase if you're a fan.",1393718400,2,1693,4.264797507788162

I collected a lot of comic books but didn't know the value they would someday so gave them away or threw them away since the family moved a lot back in the day. Marvel comics got a lot of my dimes and quarters (dating myself). The movie kept my attention and the action very good, just wish Thor wasn't blind to Lady Sif who is hotter than Portman in my opinion and what man is so into a woman and doesn't act when she is obviously signaling. Oh! well PC movies of this day. Kids already know better. Thanks Amazon for the movie at the right price for me!",1393718400,,591,4.016949152542373
6085147,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I will admit, it wasn't as good as the original. But very few sequels are. And even fewer excel beyond the original. However, this one had few complaints. Chief among them was how annoying Kat Dennings' character had become. Where in the first Thor she served as comic relief, apparently now they gave her an intern to take that mantle and relegated her to be a pompous, know-it-all who carries an uninteresting, predictable subplot. Unfortunately, there are corny, typical Hollywood clichs abound, but quite luckily it doesn't take away from how well-written the main plot progresses and how awesomely the action comes across.

The plot was underdeveloped, or perhaps not well executed.  Loki surprises as always, but Rene Russo was underutilized, and Portman's character also underutilized for that matter.  Natalie Portman & Chris Hemsworth have NO chemistry together.  I love Chris Hemsworth as THOR.  But this film was dry as toast.  Best thing I can say is good action and effects.

For those of you wondering about Special Features; It includes a Marvel One-Shot short film, Deleted Scenes, and goes into detail about the tale of the Two brothers, and how the score for the movie was made.

Thankfully this one doesn't spend as much time on Earth and when it does it is mostly pretty fun and humorous and thankfully the bureaucratic S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff is muted and almost non-existent here.

Which is a real shame, because I enjoyed the movie immensely and have been waiting to buy it when it came out.  Supremely disappointing.  And if this is a trend of things to come, I won't be buying those movies either.

I mean, just appears. Skaarsgard , well, saw him on the news for a second and that was embarassing enough. I am only , well, under an hour into it and am losing interest fast, S***, I wanted to like this. Loved the 1st one, watched it this morning. I must say the Avengers also sucked, bombastic, frantically paced nonsense to me. I will try again, since I bought it, but... Marvel better re-examine who green lights this stuff because it's not as good , just more eye candy instead of story which means no emotional involvement. Iron Man III, really? Kinda like Terminator III, y'know?",1393632000,4,882,4.809210526315789

This movie is fast paced to the point that it stays interesting but slow enough to not leave the viewer confused.  Loki is even more sarcastic than ever and the movie itself holds a couple of unexpected plot twists.

2. Steelbook is Great Quality and nice cover design.
Now for the commentary:
I have been on the ""short end"" of the Best Buy Steelbook stock MANY times: Zero Dark Thirty, Taken 2, Fast and Furious 6, Resident Evil Afterlife, Underworld Awakening, and more. Missed out on all of them because of these ""Dealers"". For once I was able to be the at Opening and grab one of the shelf.
I have talked to Best Buy and Amazon Customer reps and they refuse to take action against this piracy.
As for the idiot below who believes that Best Buy is getting ""Thousands"" more in stock.... You've been Had. This (like ALL others) was a ""One Time"", ""No Rainchecks"", ""Blink and you Missed it"" release.

6085288,4,B00GLPCKX8,"IMHO the distributor got sneaky on this one. Normally when you buy the 3D+ combo it includes a DVD of the movie. That is NOT the case on this item. Unfortunately I didn't realize there was no DVD until I already opened it :(

{{And no, I don't recall there being no mention of DVD in Amazon's product title -- I was more than likely too busy drooling over idea of seeing movie again on the day of its vid release & keeping an eye on the pricing}}

I actually make a point of buying most of the movies I like in Bluray+DVD+DC format in case I want to watch it in different rooms of my house (I don't have a BR play in every room). Just wanted to make sure no one else made the same mistake I did.

As for the movie, it's great. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bought it, much less to have tried to purchase the combo version.",1393545600,8,819,4.04320987654321

The movie was epic in scope and the exploration of relationships: Father, Mother, Brother, Son were very moving.  The action sequences were very visually impactful and the humor was subtle, but very well placed and lightened some tense moments.
I loved the special features included with the Amazon release....Trevor Slattery in a Marvel Short, the exploration of Loki and Thor as brothers.  Really enjoyed watching those.  Worth the purchase....one of my favorite Avengers' movies!",1393545600,,563,5.292134831460674

6085328,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Movie was great, quality of the transfer, as well.  3D was well-done, too.  As to the exclusion of the DVD, this was at least a fiver less than the traditional B3D/BD/DVD/DC sets.  I generally do prefer to get a DVD, but it is not a five dollar value add to me.

The digital copy is not itunes only anymore...you can actually redeem it on Amazon, Vudu, and Google Play.  While I have a DVD player in my car, I rarely take them anywhere...the digital copy works for that on basically anything I want to watch.

Yes, 3D never caught on as no one wanted to buy a new TV, but really if you buy a TV today because you need to 3D is basically a low marginal amount, so why not.  I do enjoy watching movies in 3D so I get the 3D version generally for any kind of action film.",1393545600,,768,4.046357615894039

I didn't care to much for the first installment of Thor; I always thought that they should have spent more time on his planet. The opening scenes of the first one were the best parts of the movie. I was really tried hard not to like this movie; but once I started watching, I was presently surprised by my viewing experience. My wife who doesn't care to much for super hero movies; even liked the movie.  I guess there was a fly on the wall because they fixed it; unlike politics, they gave the people what they were promised a great movie. Keep up the good work.

Comedic one liners and cameos seem out of place, while truly great chemistry and acting is often over shadowed by such attempts. Story and plot lines were satisfying but shallow and some supporting characters just didn't connect. I would have loved to have seen a deeper plot with characters I could become attached to, but like the first one this movie is not much deeper...

It's really refreshing to see heroes that aren't morons dealing with big crazy comic book stuff.

6085346,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Great action/ adventure movie... easily recommended for simply being a fun and entertaining flick.
Although I am not a diehard comic fan, this superhero movie certainly rates as one of the better ones. Plenty of action, good humor and some great visual effects combine for a quality ride through our world, Thor's world and the Dark World. Actors provide adequate, if not above average performances, and Loki's character is certainly one to watch for. I particularly enjoyed Loki's role in that one can simply call him out as a conniving brother ... but,  then again, you can almost come to like him. Almost... by no stretch is he Mr.  Niceguy - like Captain America -however, he does show hints of some redeeming qualities in this latest Thor flick.
The final action sequences are very entertaining ... with portals between worlds appearing at the most convenient places and times ... however some of the best surprises come at the very end and during the credits.
Overall, this movie is a solid 4 stars ... almost 4.5.

Along with being an entertaining flick, one can draw many comparisons between this movie, ""Star Trek Into the Darkness"" and ""Star Wars"" movies.
1. The battle depicted in Thor's opening scenes can draw comparisons to a Star Wars battle scene.
2. Loki and Kahn share similar holding cells. Both are reluctantly released to help fight a common enemy.
3. Both Loki and Kahn show hints of redeeming qualities,  but return to their evil roots by the movie's end.
4. Natalie Portmman's characters in Thor and Star Wars are both brought to a palace for protection during a battle. Furthermore,  one is protected by use of a hologram, the other uses a physical double.
5. The final battle scenes have an enemy spacecraft landing or crashing into a large city on Earth with the enemy emerging from the ship to do the final fight.
6. A heroine or love interest helps to save the good guy in the end (Thor and Star Trek).
Many more comparisons can be made between the three films. Definitely a candidate for a multi-film mashup or the making of an entertaining game amongst viewers!",1393459200,,2092,4.75206611570248

6085352,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor: The Dark World is, without a doubt, an excellent sequel and picks up brilliantly from, and dramatically expands on, the original. From the acting, to the FX, to the soundtrack and everything in between and around, this film delivers. Performances by all were great. Chris Hemsworth is an outstanding Thor. Tom Hiddleston fabulously portrays Thor's conniving adopted brother, Loki. Natalie Portman plays a very convincing love interest as Dr Foster. The rival for Thor's attention, Sif, comes via a marvelous Jaimie Alexander. (I do wish there had been more tension between those two, as there were times that could have occurred but did not really come across.) Of course, Anthony Hopkins as Odin is superb. And you just have to love Frigga, the outstanding Rene Russo. Others, as well, did very admirable jobs in their roles. The villains were good but Malekith might have been a bit more evil. Visual and sound (DTS-HD Hi Res Audio) on the Blu-ray is out-of-this-world. The special effects were beyond great in many cases, picking up from the first film and upping the Ante. The mix of science fiction and fantasy and magic is a difficult feat to master, but it is handled in such a way as you just accept that that is the way it is...and fly with it. Many of the battles are epic in scope and deliver the intended results in terms of impact to the viewer. Overall, this is a fantastic movie. My only gripe is not with the film, but the offering. I would have preferred Blu-ray and DVD (with digital download) rather than 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and digital, but that is not offered. If you are a fan of Thor and/or the Marvel Universe, do not hesitate, buy it. If you are unsure, get it anyway, Thor: The Dark World is excellent.",1393459200,2,1734,4.669934640522876

But somehow it was void of suspense and any fun. Curiosity kept me holding on. Chris Hemsworth is massive physically but not captivating in his scenes. Chris & Natalie lack chemistry. Acting & FX effects were solid. Overall not a memorable movie. The Queen had this best fight scene. What does that say? So the burden lies with this former GOT new director. I am a Marvel & superhero fan of the movies. I didn't like the ending. Made me google Loki's powers. I'm sure that is part of the overall Marvel arching for sequences & the Avenger's franchise but made me ""eye-roll"" too much.

Colorful, excessive CG-effects and landscapes and equally artificial acting, loud music and a goofy story, all make for great entertainment.  The Thor/Loki interactions make up the best parts of this film, while the old scientist without pants and the daffy girl, neither of whose names I can recall, definitely make up the worst parts of the film (and in thinking about it, were either of those characters even necessary?  When they cut away to their nutty sequences at the mental home, I felt it actually broke the flow and continuity of the film.  Maybe it's just me.

It also felt like there were a LOT of elements from other unrelated films that found their way here: Thor and Natalie by the waterside on Asgard felt a LOT like the same scene with Anakin and Padme on Naboo, with the same kiss and everything.  (Spoilers) The death of Thor's mother as well and the subsequent pyre had SW prequel flavors as well, and even elements of 'Tangled' with the floating lights.  And towards the end of the film, it was all about Portals.  All we needed was GLaDOS to pop into the picture and give Thor guidance.

6085359,4,B00GLPCKX8,"THOR: THE DARK WORLD plays out quite like the first film: a splashy, tongue-in-cheek, ultimately superficial comic book film with tremendous effects, charismatic actors, and predictable plot points that you don't care about because you're having so much fun.  Oh, and Tom Hiddleston stealing practically every scene as the likable (and unreliable) Loki.

This film picks up after the events of THE AVENGERS (for the record: a much superior film, not that anyone's really comparing here).  Loki is being held prisoner in Asgard, alive only by the whims of his adopted mother (Rene Russo).  Loki's brother, our titular hero, is off fighting wars, cleaning up the aftermath of what happened in New York City and places beyond.  Thor's estranged gal pal Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is feeling a little lonely.  Her scientist/mentor/friend Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) is running around naked.  Oh: and a group of evil elves, who were banished generations ago, have returned to claim a magical substance and basically wreck havoc across multiple universes or something.

Director Alan Taylor isn't trying to fill AVENGER'S epic shoes (in the way, say, the flawed IRON MAN 3 did).  Taylor's simply going back to THOR's original cinematic territory: witty dialogue, splashy battle sequences, and Chris Hemsworth's charismatic portrayal.  Athony Hopkins returns, hamming it up; and Christopher Eccleston makes a welcome appearance as the main bad, though his performance is almost utterly lost (anyone could've played the role, the way it's written and edited).  Ultimately, if you're looking for a little mindless fun, with solid performances (and a killer mid-credits scene...seriously, stick around, folks, for a look at an upcoming Marvel film), THOR: THE DARK WORLD is worth a couple hours.",1393372800,,1785,5.384892086330935

6085362,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I love 3D, but I detest this converted trash.  I ordered the 3D version of this movie prerelease.  As I had not made it to the theatre to see it, I did not realize that it was not filmed in 3D.  I generally try to read up on 3D movie releases to see if a movie is real 3D or if it has been converted.  If converted, I do not buy it in 3D.  With this movie, it did not enter my mind that it was not filmed in 3D, so I am extremely disappointed with this movie because of its having been converted.

I love the 3D effects in Green Lantern, Avatar, Mysterious Island, and Journey to the Center of the Earth, plus a few others.  This movie shows some depth and some small amount of 3D effects, but nothing jumps off the screen at you as they do in the real 3D movies.  Quite a let down.

As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Really enjoyed all the characters and the story.  The balance of humor, drama, and action is quite good.  Really no complaints about the movie.  Would recommend the Blu-ray version of this movie to anyone who enjoys these characters and/or science fiction/fantasy.  However, if you are interested in good 3D, skip this 3D converted version.

I am going to knock off a couple of stars just because the movie was not filmed in 3D.  I wish the movie companies would either film in 3D or not, and stop these worthless 3D conversion processes.  I just refuse to buy them when I am properly informed.",1393372800,4,1430,4.17948717948718

I enjoyed Thor: The Dark World as much or more than the first installment because there was more action involving supernatural forces, both bad and good. The little things did bother me though. 1. Odin's appearance: come on guys. What the heck was that? He looked like a badly beaten up street bum in this one instead of the All-Father. Geez! Whose bright idea was that? 2. The stupid crap. Too much. Especially Jane and Thor just happening to end up in the cave where all the junk from previous scenes had gathered, ie, the portal back to real-time bright world dimension. 3. Was Thor's conversation with Odin at the end all with Loki or just the last part. Yes, it seems that it all was with Loki, but that just didn't work for me. Should have been another way to have him ""not dead.""

Now that Jane basically saved the universe, does Odin have to recognize her? And big props to Tom Hiddelton. He flat out steals every scene he's in. Ton of charisma he has!

Chris is still the man though. He is a big talent and I've watched everything he's been in after he burst onto the scene in Thor. Keep it up guys. I'm looking forward to Thor 13 and beyond.

6085372,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Not a fan of superhero movies or comic books and the huge sets and CGI seemed kinda pointless to me. What do I care about imaginary gods? But whenever Tom Hiddleston's Loki appears onscreen I immediately get interested. Hiddleston seems to be playing the only character with believable emotions, or maybe he just makes them believable. (Though Kat Dennings as Darcy, Jane's intern, was very cute and funny.)  Hiddleston brings his considerable talent and training to Loki, plus a spark, an excitement, that I haven't seen him bring to his other roles, though I plan to keep looking.

But, because of Hiddleston, it's definitely a movie worth watching. They spent $170,000,000 on it and it's all on the screen. But it's still a yawn unless Loki is present. But he's there a lot. (Spoiler!!) I'm looking forward to the next movie in this franchise just for Loki and going back and re-viewing the previous ones, just for him. There's a nice set of cast interviews, including Hiddelston, in the bonus features.

The saddest part of the movie is Christopher Eccleston , who played the first Doctor Who in the reboot. But he's under a ton of makeup and speaking, mostly, non-English dialogue, and he just disappears. I've read they cut his role and added more to HIddleston's Loki. I can understand that decision but it makes me sad for Eccleston, a great actor, but one buried here.  Hope he gets a better chance in his next role.",1393372800,,1425,4.757085020242915

I'm 66 years old and started reading Thor comic books as a teen.  Of course, stories have changed over the years.

This Thor is a perfect blend of ancient, modern and the future and his values have not changed as such does not go out of style.  The interaction between Thor and Loki is excellently portrayed in this film.  The villain, Malekith, is evil.  Period.  The special effects are riveting!  While I love special effects, I am not into the gore of today that passes a entertainment.  I will enjoy watching all of this movie again.

So until I see the DVD/Blu-ray, I'm afraid I'll have to wait on buying.  Which is unfortunate because, as I said before, it's a very good show.",1393286400,41,531,3.980952380952381

6085390,1,B00GLPCKX8,"I love the movie.  Disney's decision to release this in a 3D/bluray only pack is terrible. I still want access to the DVD and there are a lot of places where Blu-ray Discs won't work.  This rating is for this combo pack.  Who actually watch 3D anyways?

We, as consumers, should send a message to Disney that this business practice is not acceptable.  If we all rate this movie combo pack low, that will send the right message.",1393286400,39,427,4.423076923076923

Two, where is the slip case? Really? This looks like the bargain bin version of this movie and I paid $20 for it! I AM disappointed that Disney cheaped out on this. I guess they are getting as bad as Paramount. Thanks for nothing... I guess I only got what I overpaid for. :(",1393286400,3,426,4.3375
6085393,1,B00GLPCKX8,"Love the movie very very much just like I love every other Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, but the sheer fact that this doesn't come with a Blu ray DVD combo is enough to make me not buy. They made a lot of money on this movie why can't they make everybody able to have it? They did with the Avengers! What about those that don't even own a Blu ray player? So you can't have the gag reel either because you don't have a Blu ray player? That's very unfair Marvel. As for me and my money we will just have to do with not having until they release a, pack that has a DVD in it. Even though I OWN a Blu ray player myself. Not everybody is made of money Marvel think about the people that don't have everything!!  It's a real shame too because the movie is good.

HOWEVER, Disney has decided that people can't buy a Blu-ray & DVD combo.  NOOOO, you must buy the 3D blu-ray if you want a combo pack.  Nevermind that most people don't give a darn about 3D and that it's kids who think it soooo cool that they thought drek like Avatar was a good movie because it was pretty and 3D.  Plot?  Kids don't need a plot!
So, for Adults who don't care about useless 3D, we're out of luck.

I said it once and Ill say it again, people have been so spoiled after the Avengers, they think every movie after it should be the same as epic. They are wrong. If all we get are action, wheres the drama? Thor has always been the romantic comedy of all the MCU films, learn to accept it as it is. This movie was great, and ten tiimes better than the first one. Asgard was believable and beautiful, not too disney kingdom-y but a galactic city. I do hate that people put Loki in the spotlight too much, but I liked the villain, I liked the story, I liked the style, Heck i even liked the post credit scene. I liked everything about this movie, i saw it twice in theaters. It wasn't boring. And that ending... People are dumb and don't deserve to watch these movies.

6085416,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The original Thor was a good movie, but I just didn't fall in love with it like the rest of the country. Thor: The Dark World on the other hand is the Thor movie I wanted the first time.

For starters, the majority of Dark World takes place on, well, not Midgard but many of the other eight worlds. Marvel seems to be getting its viewers used to a more sci-fi setting in preparation for Guardians of the Galaxy. I was taken aback at first by the use of space ships and laser guns, but special care is used to point out that these are not actually mystical gods but basically space aliens. Secondly, although Loki was an awesome villain before, I didn't realize until Dark World that he wasn't written correctly. Now, hes using his illusions and trickery to full effect and spouting off quips better than Spider-Man has in four movies. Also, the battles feel more epic this time and outdo anything I saw in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.

Thor: The Dark World is an awesome continuation of the Marvel saga and only makes me hungrier for the rest of Phase 2. BTW stay though ALL the credits!

6085417,5,B00GLPCKX8,Love it. Thor does what a movie is supposed to do. Take us from our world of pain and problems to the world of Asgard. The chemistry between Thor and Loki is fantastic. In this movie Thor must team up with Loki to save the Universe from Malekith and the other dark elves.,1392854400,2,271,4.132075471698113
6085418,3,B00GLPCKX8,So it felt a little rushed and lacked any real plot or connection with the first one.  However I still enjoyed it as I like any superhero movie now days.,1392854400,2,153,4.1
6085419,5,B00GLPCKX8,So vivid great story love the characters and the humor.  I bought it and am glad I did!! Love it!,1392854400,,97,3.85

6085425,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I find this Thor movie lacking mystery surrounding the aliens attacking the Asguardians, Fight scene were very good, plots were very good, and even Loki demise was well planned. The ending could of been different, meaning Thor's riding a subway was out of context...are we selling subway ads in the movies now? This really took away from the fight scene. Plus the Alien leader was to easily defeated. Also, I feel lately that Thor is getting beaten up to often. His battles when facing his top enemies should be at least equal or slightly better. If we are going to cheer for the good guy. Then make his fight scenes more competitive. That's my take on the movie, other than those few areas. I liked the movie a lot...BnCobra Jons",1392854400,,730,4.623076923076923

6085444,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Its only three years ago that Thor hit the big screen. It was soon followed by The Avengers where we met Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) again. Now Thor and Loki come back in the (first, I believe) sequel Thor: The Dark World and the two Marvel Comics characters team up to fight Dark Elves led by the vengeful Malekith (Christopher Eccleston).

In the meanwhile, Thor: The Dark World explores the romantic side of Thor, with Natalie Portman reprising the role of his love Dr. Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins comes back as Odin, king of Asgard, and so do Stellan Skarsgrd as Dr. Erik Selvig (running around naked  really) and Idris Elba as Asgardian sentry Heimdall.

Watching these capable actors doing what they can do is fun, to be sure, and the special effects are first-rate, as you expect from the recent Marvel Comics franchise, but the story is a bit familiar. Also, the sequel lacks style in the way it shows action and characters. The entire film feels like a mid-section of a long TV series. It has enough action and humor, but doesnt seem to know where it is going.

Thor: The Dark World is a decent entry in Marvel cinematic universe that keeps expanding, but not the best.",1392595200,,1212,4.623255813953488

6085448,3,B00GLPCKX8,"I am a Marvel fan, and have to say this movie did nothing for me. The plot was predictable and never made sense, and I gave it wide latitude due to comic book roots. You get to a point where you don't care about the main characters any more and hope that Loki or the girl from ""two broke girls"" say something clever to break the monotony. Glossy production and eye candy, no substance at all. So glad I skipped this at the theaters, I would have been mad if this was the end of a night out.",1392595200,4,490,4.010204081632653

6085474,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie makes the first Thor movie look like a bad memory.  It blows that one out of the water.  Easily.  In fact, I'd say this movie is more akin to the Avengers in style.  Truthfully, I'm not sure WHY Thor just didn't call upon a couple Avengers to help him.  Hulk alone would have evened the odds immediately.  But, alas, this is Thor's chance to shine.  He does.

There are a lot of interesting foes Thor and his little gang have to contend with before they even meet the dark elves.  Then there is a lot of magic and science I cannot pretend to understand that makes the story a lot of fun to follow.  Loki and the dark elves keep the tension high in this movie.  There are a few nice twists and surprises, and a few startling ones.  (Stay for the scene that appears after the credits roll for a nice surprise).

The creativity in this film is HIGH!  Fighting between realms of existence.  Following Thor's hammer as it tries to get back to him using various routes.  Magic transforming dark elves in hulking monsters.  Other monsters dropping into the fight.  Dogfights between ships with amazing powers and Norse designs.  Frigga kicking some serious . . . elf.  (Frigga pretty much saves the day until something intervenes.  Very nice.)  Kat Dennings comedy relief.  You get the idea--LOTS of fun to be had watching this film.

Action-packed, loaded with superb effects, and boasting a top-notch supporting cast, Thor: The Dark World is visually stunning, at times funny, and thrilling all the way through.  No corny dialogue.  No waste-of-time love scenes.  Just a solid sci-fi fantasy story wrapped in Norse mythology.

WATCH IT.  If you are a Marvel fan, BUY IT.  They did well.",1392249600,2,1692,4.63728813559322
6085475,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Chris Hemsworth is worthy to play the part of Thor. I can't imagine anyone else playing the God of Thunder. Likewise, Tom Hiddleston IS Loki, a living, breathing Trickster god. Those roles are set in stone in my mind; the others can come and go (OK, not Darcy or Selvig).

A double dose of pure menace is present; along with Loki, there is Christopher Eccleston, who has played many larger than life roles, such as the Duke of Norfolk in Elizabeth, Major Henry West in 28 Days Later, Destro in GI Joe, and in the science fiction mega-classic Doctor Who as the Doctor. Eccleston exudes pure hatred as Malekith the Accursed. One can never be certain just what a megalomaniacal despot will do next, and Eccleston has the right bearing to make it all spine-chillingly creepy.

The story is solid, the CGI and stunts mix flawlessly, and the superb acting make this movie a must-see.",1392249600,,877,4.651612903225806

It includes the strengths of a good superhero movie (great action scenes, moments of levity), and avoids the pitfalls--the audience is spared a boring origin story that makes the movie 2 1/2 hours long.

6085486,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Everyone gets something different out of a film, and I've come to realize that where I see shortcomings, others are often dazzled. Anyway though, to me Thor: The Dark World suffers from an almost complete lack of substantive character development and a plot that is mostly devoid of true drama or suspense. It's bigger than the first Thor film, but in my opinion not as good. It's really not even as dark, when you get right down to it, in spite of what the title suggests.

Lack of character development? Other than Frigga and Heimdall in respectively brief scenes, The Dark World does not move anyone forward. There's plenty of Thor being Thor, Loki being Loki, etc. We've already got that much in Thor and The Avengers; this is just more of the same. There was a chance here to get personal and interesting by exploring the love triangle between Thor, Jane and Sif, but other than a brief allusion, that plot line is not touched.

The villains here, The Dark Elves, are not really any different from the Frost Giants of the first film from a storytelling standpoint, and the Elves are less relatable. They fit squarely into the ""generic army of darkness who want to destroy everything because that's what they do"" trope. Epic, but mundane. And is there ever any doubt that they will be defeated? I did not find any drama there. (Marvel Studios' one key weakness so far is the ability to develop interesting villains.) The Jane Foster story arc could have been the prime source of drama, but her character is awkwardly written and strangely out-of-focus.

Bottom line, The Dark World is great-looking and solid enough, but lacks a spark of freshness or drama. It's more solid than Iron Man 2, but less entertaining, and thus for me The Dark World is the most disappointing Marvel Studios film to date. And that's coming from someone who loved the first Thor film. But this is just my perspective.",1392163200,7,1898,4.693693693693693

6085489,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel Studios has done a great job of bringing the comic book world to the big screen.  I like Thor and wanted to love this movie, there were some great moments, but overall, i regretted purchasing.  I purchased because i had just finished watching the Avengers and was wanting another great story to keep it going.  This is not a bad movie, just more like a rental.

6085490,3,B00GLPCKX8,"It had more of the comic feel to it than the first Thor, but the First Thor, was better in terms of development it seems to me. It is not a bad movie, just not as good as the first Thor in my view.  The most innovative thing I think was the music and end credit pictures-the painting of the characters was unique and gave a neat finish to the movie.  It follows from Avengers and also Thor 1, but it is missing something, can't quite put my hand on it-that is why I can only give it three stars.",1392163200,,495,3.94

6085494,4,B00GLPCKX8,"In Thor: The Dark World, Thor at last returns to Earth when Jane Foster's in trouble. Thor finds she's been infected by the Aether, a powerful world destroying force that could allow the Malekith, the ruler of Dark Elves to bring all nine realms into darkness. The war takes a personal toll for Thor, who comes with a plan to defeat Malekith. However, the plan requires he defy his father and obtain Loki's help.

While Marvel films set on Earth have a similar feel to them, everything is different in Asgard. It just has a whole different fantasy feel to it and they really make it work with this great back story.

Marvel really struck the right balance with the tone. There are some serious moments in this story, and the relationships between the characters are real and interesting.

However, the movie manages to have this while not becoming too dark and brooding. Marvel movies tend to take certain things very seriously such as friendship, loyalty, and heroism without taking itself too serious. Thor is an awesome hero who is just fun to watch, particularly in the last battle against Malekith.

The one thing that bothered me is that the movie left many unresolved threads. I hope they're resolved in Thor 3 and not in Avengers 2 as Asgard and Ultron shouldn't really mix.

Overall, this was a good movie but not a great one. It's not Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or even Superman: The Movie. It won't make anyone all time lists for anything. It won't be one critics will think a lot about in 20 years, but it'll survive because it's great entertainment. Like a Charlie Chan movie or an episode of Little House on the Prairie, it knows what you want and gives it to you well.",1392076800,,1682,4.6120401337792645

6085501,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I keep thinking these Marvel/Disney movies are going to get formulaic but they keep getting better.  This is better than the original and now having Loki around makes the Thor story/universe alot more interesting.  The plot is pretty standard...super powerful bad guy shows up, good guys work together(after working out their differences) to save the universe and multiple other dimensions.

The only downsides are the main villain and Natalie Portman's crew.  You'd think a crazy powerful dark elf would at least have some good lines but he really doesn't say much and there isn't much exposition to explain who he is.  Natalie Portman shows up and looks good but for some reason Kat Denning is downplayed as a nerdy sidekick.  Whatever scientific equipment they're using doesn't make any sense and it's not relateable to any science I've ever heard of.  In the end it wound up looking like a weak attempt to make sure a female earth character helped save the day.

But overall it's a good movie in a series that keeps getting better and it's definitely worth watching.",1392076800,,1070,4.905555555555556

So I guess I own it for as long as I am alive.

I am so happy that they still show Thor spinning his hammer... it brings back good memories of all of those awesome Jack Kirby drawings.  There was a lot of science fiction in this one, and of course... a lot of action.  Two unexpected deaths... ? Good villains...  Hemsworth is definitely an awesome Thor.  This was about as good as the recent Avengers movie.  If you like the other Marvel movies... you will enjoy this one.

6085513,1,B00GLPCKX8,"I love this movie. Saw it in the theaters twice.

So when I saw this was available on instant video with bonus features, I jumped on it! I should've looked before I leaped. I use my PS3 to watch movies (Blu-rays, DVDs as well as streaming). I didn't realize that by purchasing the Amazon instant video that I can stream the movie whenever I want to but I can't download it and watch it off-line. I found I could theoretically download it to the PC after installing Amazon's Unbox Viewer. Unfortunately, the movie is HD and the Unbox viewer doesn't support HD movies. So I have purchased a $20 HD movie that I can only watch when I have an internet and should that connection be too slow for whatever reason, I'll only be able to see in standard definition that I can't download to my computer that has an HD monitor because Amazon's Unbox software can't handle an HD movie. Plus, you cannot get a refund even should you realize the horrible mistake that purchasing this HD digital movie was within minutes after purchase.

I was able to see the bonus features (which I was really looking forward to) by fast-forwarding to the end of the movie (there are no ""chapter"" selections) and guessing at which minute the special features start and just sitting through the whole without knowing which feature would be next.

You can download this movie if you have an iPad or Kindle and also want to view an action blockbuster in HD on tiny little screen.

My advice: save your $20 and just wait until Feb. 25th when you can buy a physical copy of this movie.",1391990400,10,1550,4.48581560283688

6085526,5,B00GLPCKX8,"As I kid I used to read the marvel comics, although Thor was not my favorite, (That would be Spiderman or the Fantastic Four, I even owned Spiderman #1 until I sold it in the late 70's.)

This movie continues the mythology and builds on it effectively.  Combining the personal conflicts between Thor, Loki, and Odin and showing the eternal realm facing the threat of destruction.  It is almost a combination of LOTR, Star Wars, and some Shakespearian tragedy.  If anything this movie even EXCEEDS the source material from the old comics.

Great action, with Thor fighting an enemy that seems even stronger than the Hulk, Loki giving us some surprises (what else would you expect from the god of trickery?) and more of the eternal realm revealed.  I could not imagine any other actors playing these roles now.  The conflict between Odin and Thor and Odin's problem with Jane Foster is very much as I remember it from the comic book.

I wanted to see Thor go toe to toe with Malekith on his own or least have one of the avengers make a special appearance in the fight, but not some chic scientist are you kidding me. That's why I gave it 4 stars.

Also they need to be careful not to get to involved with the Love scenes. That was the down fall of most of Supermans (except Man of Steel, which was awesome) and the love scenes in Spiderman. We don't want to see that garbage.",1391731200,,660,4.196850393700787

6085547,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Although I was heavily critical last year about the high grossing, yet controversial movie Iron Man 3, I was keeping tidbits and a close eye on reports about Thor the Dark World. And I chose to do the review at an almost convenient time; if 24 days before its dvd/blu-ray release date is what you call convenient. So here are my thoughts on Thor the Dark World.

After the almost cataclysmic events of The Avengers, Loki is punished for his crimes he has committed while on Earth. And as for our main hero Thor, is meanwhile informed that the 9 realms are to be aligned. Soon, his love interest Jane Foster is sucked into another world and later infected therefore given a resurection to our main antagonist Malekith(Christopher Eccleston). A war soon begins and upon realizing the fight is too great even for him, Thor enlists Loki's assistance in defeating Malekith, and so our movie begins.

Thor continues to surprise me. Chris Hemsworth was great once again as the titular hero in this movie. Tom Hiddleston didn't necessarily steal the show, but he once again delivered wonders, and humor as Loki. Also returning are Natalie Portman as Jane, Kat Dennings as Darcy, Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Jaimie Alexander as Sif.

All in all, as Phase 2 began with Iron Man 3, Thor the Dark World is an enjoyable and highly likable sequel thanks to the acting, visuals, and the story line that started the movie off on the right track, and ends with a surprise cliffhanger. Not only is this a good movie, but Thor the Dark World is a sequel that refines everything good about the 2011 film.

6085548,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie is amazing! It is pretty scary at times and really cool. It also had a lot of action and suspense, but it also is kind of confusing at times because it switches back and forth through different worlds a lot.

This movie is all about a girl named Jane (played by Natalie Portman) who is a scientist and is the girlfriend of Thor (who is played by Chris Hemsworth) who found this place that had a red substance under a rock called the Ether. This substance is absorbed into Janes body and whenever someone touches her, the Ether zaps them by using her energy and makes Jane pass out every time. There are these evil elves who are trying to get the Ether to destroy the whole universe. The leader of the elves is Malekith. Now the king (Thors farther) advises against going against Malekith but he does it anyway.

The main characters in the movie are Thor, Jane, Loki, Malekith, Odin, and Darcy. My favorite character in this movie is Darcy because she is really funny and really cool. She is also pretty amazing to help out to save the world.

My favorite part in the movie is when, at the very beginning of the movie, Jane found a building that seemed normal but when she went inside they found out that in the building there are secret passage ways that you cant see and low gravity, which means that you can pick up a gasoline truck with one finger! Why I like this part so much is because Jane found the Ether under a rock which went into her body and could not be taken out! The weirdest part was that when it went in her body, it seemed like it was 1 minute but it turns out that she was gone for 5 hours!

I recommend this movie for ages 11 and up because this movie is pretty scary and pretty intense that I don't think a younger audience would enjoy it. Go out and see this movie in theaters now!

6085549,4,B00GLPCKX8,"While it topped ""Thor"" in the action category it did lack in being completely unique as it felt like a easy sequel to make, however the creative team did do certain things (like improve the visuals especially Thor's flight and give more screen time to actors such as Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins) to make it worthy, and almost on par with the first. Overall it is an enjoyable visual treat with great action. My biggest complaint about this film would be that Natalie Portman again makes a paycheck performance while Hemsworth up'ed his game.

And it stole more than a few action tropes from Peter Jackson, Geo. Lucas, and others; not to mention musical score. But once it kicked into gear it was an absolute hoot. Exciting, fun, occasionally even moving. I especially liked its willingness to poke fun at itself. Lots of good laughs here, too.

6085557,5,B00GLPCKX8,"There's more action in this movie than in Thor 1 but I never felt the overkill factor kick in.  I liked Thor 2 because his ""posse"" of friends are not just window dressing this go around.  Ditto for Rene Russo, they gave her some strong acting moments.  Idris Elba is back and has some cool moves, they also give him some dialog with his helmet off.  Many funny moments.  Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston are great as always.  I thought that Asgaard's ""steampunk"" looking air defense and air force was very cool.  The enemy's collapsing field grenades were different.  My one complaint about this episode - without giving away too much -- is that the emotional investment and sense of loss in tragedy is greatly diminshed when the movie studio / writers resurrect a character from what was presented and witnessed in a scene (i.e. what you are lead to believe) as certain death... by using sleight-of-hand plot tricks.  For those who remember that far back this was the problem with Star Trek II (Wrath of Khan).  The director of that movie didn't want hedge his bets but the studio forced him to leave a way out for resurrection to bring a major character back in the future.  Ahh almighty dollar and the studios hedging their bets.  I still give Thor 2,  five stars.",1389484800,8,1269,4.611607142857143
6085558,3,B00GLPCKX8,"To the disagreement of several critics, I feel this film is a great improvement from the first, and it compliments the series quite well.

Better acting, superior plot, believable character development, and slightly more formidable villains.

The story sweeps you up with surprise twists and turns, and there's a massive cliffhanger for you to sink your speculating teeth into long after viewing.

If you're opting for a Marvel movie - this is one of the better ones, and you can totally enjoy it with or without having seen the first film.

With that being said - I definitely recommend watching this with some friends for maximum enjoyment.

Why?

Because it's the ensuing conversation that will make the film more than a onetime view that serves primarily as adequate escapism, eye candy, and a few nice laughs.

Visual this movie fits into the fantasy realm and is one of the best vfx movies ever. They dive deeper into Asgard and take us to other realms never seen in the movies before. The story is great and has it all and was surprisingly funny,. Plot was rich with twist and turns and a great revelation a  the very end straight out the comics. My only complaint was that it could of used a little bit more character development for the villain, Malekith the accursed. In the comics he is one of the most fierce and crazy villains out there and I though the movie could use one more scene to show that before the rest of the story gets going. That complaint aside the actor who played the role was great  and Marvel continues to cast great actors for these roles. No one can ever play Thor and Loki again and the chemistry that Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston is amazing. And Anthony Hopkins always delivers.
Overall it's worth the watch for anyone and I found it much better than the first. They've set up this story line to continue making great sequels and I'll continue to fork over my hard earned cash to Marvel.

6085563,5,B00GLPCKX8,"First off, I have to say that if you're looking for solid science in this movie, you're barking up the wrong tree and should buy yourself some Stephen B. Hawking and let the rest of us just enjoy a rip-roaring fun movie. The reviews that called to task the science in ""Thor: The Dark World"" just make me laugh. After all, this is a Marvel Universe movie, one in which a gamma irradiated scientist turns into a green monster when he's mad and in which a super soldier can sleep in ice for decades and wake up to rock spandex and a shield. Who cares if Jane and Erik Selvig spout nonsense? I mean, come on, can you honestly say you know what would happen if a bunch of dark elves decide to return the universe to darkness? No? Right, so let's move on shall we. ""Thor: The Dark World"" kicks cinematic butt, picking up where ""The Avengers"" left off with Thor putting out fires across the 9 Realms and Loki being kicked to the curb...er, dungeon...for trying to subjugate us poor Midgardians. When Jane Foster -- who is understandably bummed because her man didn't call even when he was in New York (really, Thor, you couldn't have checked in after the schwarma date with the other Avengers?) -- stumbles on this cool looking red stuff that The Big Bad Dark Elf Malekith wants, it sets in motion the events that lead to Thor forming a complicated alliance with Loki. That alliance is at the heart of the movie and provides the most riveting scenes. Good friends in real life, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston know Thor and Loki respectively, inside and out, and give them depth and texture that in many ways make the Marvel Thor series the richest in terms of characterization. In particular, Hiddleston's Loki is psychologically complex and sympathetic while never losing his essential mischievousness. Loki is one of the most compelling villains in modern cinema thanks to Hiddleston. In ""Thor: TDW,"" Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings also shine, providing much of the comedy. Other high points of the movie are the look of Asgard and the rousing original score by Brian Tyler. There's a lot to love in this movie.

6085570,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The first Thor film was quite a surprise to me and my wife.  I was never into the comics (more of an X-Men and Spider-Man kid growing up) but we borrowed the DVD from a friend who was super into all the MCU movies and insisted we see the individual films that preceded the Avengers.  Of the whole lot he lent us, Thor ended up being the surprise favorite (almost edging out Iron Man as my fav Marvel movie at that point).  Here was a convincingly realized blend of sci-fi and fantasy that emphasized character relationships over flashy special effects (though it had tons of those too :D ) and starred a hero that was big on heart and easy to root for.

Thanks to a $5 Ticket Tuesday deal at the local cinema, my wife and I happily plunked down the ten bucks it took for her and me to see Thor: The Dark World.  How does it stack up to its predecessor?

Honestly, its at least as good if not better than the first!  The story goes that a long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, the Dark Elves led by Malekith (oddly enough, played by my favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/doctor/dp/B0089AD8IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">doctor</a>... maybe it was the ears?) wanna kill everything and the Asgardians, led by Thor's grandpa, kick their butts... well, almost.  The Dark Elves have this thing called the Aether, basically a big dangerous mass of floating Pepsi, and it can apparently destroy all life, which the Dark Elves wanna use to do just that when the 9 realms align and allow easy (and random, as we'll soon see) travel between the realms.  The Asgardians have hidden the Aether and the remaining Dark Elves lay in wait for another chance to strike.

As you may have guessed, the Dark Elves are evil.  We also know they're evil because they look scary, they fly around in spaceships that look like ashen golf tees that are apparently coal powered given the soot that pours out of them (btw, how funny is it that I'm writing about elves in coal powered spaceships on December 24th?), they apparently sleep by being suspended from their faces in some HR Giger looking device straight outta&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00000ILDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, and if one of the Dark Elves wants to become some kinda superwarrior, Malekith cuts open the guy's side, shoves a piece of charcoal in 'em, and turns him into the bass player from GWAR.  As I said, they're evil.

Flash forward 5000 years to modern times, and the 9 realms are about to align again, as they do every 5000 years (incidentally, in this film, every planet inhabited with life apparently has the same length year as Earth does).  On Asgard, Loki is being locked in prison forever (yeah, we all know how long that's gonna last) and Thor just got back from beating down one of the 9 realms that was rebelling against Asgard and is trying to celebrate with his warrior pals: the viking dude, the raven haired warrior chick who has a crush on him, and that three musketeers guy (now played by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chuck/dp/B000VWC9YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chuck</a>&nbsp;for some reason), but he can't because he's sad about Natalie Portman and misses her.

Back on earth, The scientist who had his mind controlled by Loki in the Avengers is crazy and running around England naked.  Also in England is Natalie Portman who is trying to cope with Thor not being around by agreeing to a blind date with Roy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-IT-Crowd/dp/B001NOMOS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the IT Crowd</a>&nbsp;when Darcy busts in and says they found something weird.  Turns out they stumbled on a spot in an abandoned hallway where they can drop whatever they want into the spot and it disappears.  What it ends up being is a place where the realms have intersected, creating a portal between dimensions (these portals will hereby be referred to as ""plot holes"").  To make a way too long summary shorter, Portman falls into a plot hole and finds the floating Pepsi, which absorbs into her body.  Thor finds Portman and takes her to Asgard as the Dark Elves start to formulate their attack.

Will Thor manage to get the floating Pepsi out of Portman before its too late?  Will Loki get out of jail?  Will anyone actually trust him for some reason if he does?  Will the Dark Elves use their magic Pepsi to destroy all life, even if that means they apparently die too?  Will the plot holes provide many points of convenience for the otherwise impossible situations our heroes will find themselves in?  Will ANY of the Asgardian gaurds finally start using guns since every one of their enemies seem to have them?  Will the crazy scientist ever find PANTS????

Lest my sarcasm fool anyone, this movie, while fairly ridiculous, is also totally awesome, and I loved every second of it.  As convoluted and crazy as some of the plot is, the movie manages to juggle it all pretty well and places it in a universe where this stuff actually seems like it can happen.  The humor is abundant but never twee, the fantastic action sequences remind me of what potential the modern Star Wars films could've had if someone other than George Lucas had the creative control, and the strong interpersonal dynamics of the characters (a key strength of the first Thor movie) remain, never getting eclipsed by the great action.

If you hate these kind of comic book flicks, this one absolutely won't change your mind, but if you liked the first Thor, or any of the MCU movies, this is a *very* worthy entry, imho easily beating out Iron Man 2 and 3, as well as Captain America and either of the Hulk movies.  Tons of fun!  Keep it up, gang, I look forward to Thor 3!",1387843200,18,5836,4.958932238193018
6085571,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Since this film is somewhat ridiculous, I have decided to write with a less than professional tone (See my Gangster Squad review for a similar example).  Warning, sarcasm ahead.

Marvel Studios onslaught of high-octane entertainment continues with this years Thor: The Dark World.  Things may have quieted down on Earth after the Battle of New York, featured in 2012s The Avengers, but the same can not be said about Asgard.  It turns out that the evil dark elves, along with their leader, Malekith have been awaiting an opportunity to strike.  What do they want to strike and when do they want to strike it?  Well, it turns out the dark elves hate the light and they want to cast the universe in darkness.  A perfect opportunity arises when the 9 realms of the universe align, a convergence that only happens every 5000 years causing gravitational abnormalities and bringing about the Yang-Mills anomaly that could open crossroads to universe intersections like the nexus of all reality or, in the case of this film, a fault that starts a cosmic eclipse linking the dark elves realm, Svartalfheim, to Earth!

So, the stakes are high.

The aforementioned cosmic eclipse happens to open right in cutie-pie, scientist, Jane Fosters (Natalie Portman) backyard.  This causes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to reunite with Foster for the first time in two years.  While Foster feels a bit burned by the length of time her supposed loves been away, it doesnt stop her from joining him on a spur of the moment jaunt to Asgard in the hopes that she can aid the Asgardians in their fight against the dark elves.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Thor: The Dark World, but the fact that I had to write a sentence that included dark elves, Norse realms, convergence, nexus, and cosmic eclipses lets you know that were dealing with a film that will not be everybodys cup of mead.  Nonetheless, Marvel knows their core audience, and it seems that the Thor franchise is aimed directly at them (or us).  However, if you are not a Thor fan and are looking for a reason to see this film, you need look no further than Tom Hiddleston as Loki.  Hiddleston steals every scene hes in and since its public knowledge that he will not appear I the sequel to The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World is your one-stop-shop to get your Loki fix.

The original definition of a B movie, is a low-budget commercial film that is in some way inferior to major releases.  Thor: The Dark World does not fit this description entirely, but it has the feel.  It is a somewhat ridiculous film, but once it gets rolling, it is a lot of fun, especially the last 30 minutes.  It is certainly the weakest in the Marvel franchise, but so far that should not be too dissuading.  B

Thor: The Dark World is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 52 minutes.  As with all Marvel movies, stay tuned during the credits for tie-ins to upcoming films.  Thor: The Dark World has a teaser during credits as well as one after credits.",1387756800,3,2981,4.593572778827977
6085572,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The second installment of Thor delivers the goods. The production values, performances and story are surprisingly good for a sequel. It manages to avoid descending into camp and provides plenty of action for audiences. Refreshingly, the 3D CGI is intelligently used and enhances the entertainment value for the audience. This action-adventure fantasy combines multiple genres with a touch of comedy and it works surprisingly well. My only complaint is that it is relatively light on blood and violence (probably due to the PG-13 rating). You get the 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and a digital HD copy in this 2-disc release.

Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman are not strong points in terms of acting, but great performances by Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Christopher Eccleston as the dark elf, Malekith, not to mention Anthony Hopkins, more than make up for it. Just as Sean Connery was born to play James Bond, so it is with Hiddleston. That's not to say that Hiddleston is on the same par as Connery, but I was very impressed with his performance. The plot surrounds the dark elves pursuit of the Aether, which is a power of unimaginable power that is able to plunge the Nine Realms into darkness. Portman's character comes into possession of the power that was hidden, and the pursuit begins. It's a race against time that only Thor can run. 4/5 stars. Worth a replay? Yes.

6085575,4,B00GLPCKX8,"If you would have told me in 2010, that a Shakesperean director, a hunky Australian, and a tall British TV actor would craft a hugely popular and profitable franchise centered around the Nordic gods...I would have asked what you were smoking. Today, it is clear that Marvel, under the lead of Kevin Feige, has crafted a winning formula that clearly works. The keys to Marvel's box office success include their careful building, relatable characters, and the fact that they are not afraid to mix genres, AND have fun while doing all of it. Thor 2: The Dark World follows this formula to a T (a big T, shaped like a hammer...). But that doesn't matter, because as I said before, the formula WORKS.

Well, not ALL of it works. The scientific mumbo-jumbo (courtesy of Portman and Skarsgard) is, quite frankly, embarrassing, and while Christopher Eccleston's Malekith may look like the badass lovechild of Nosferatu and Legolas, he's far from a compelling villain. This is not to mention a certain Deux ex Machina that rather staggers disbelief.

But enough of cons! Thor 2, headed by the gritty sensibilities of Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones), takes the world built by Kenneth Branagh, and ups the stakes, the chemistry, and the characters to new heights! It takes place in a fully realized and visually stunning world (look out for Iceland doubling as the realm of the dark elves), but never loses it's fantastic touch. Chris Hemsworth is (quite literally, erm) solid as Thor, but it is his supporting cast are the true scene stealers. Tom Hiddleston's devilishly good Loki is a highlight; scheming, tricking, and lying his way through the movie, all with a glint in his green eyes and an air of sarcasm. Thor 2 would not be half of what it is without Hiddleston. It's refreshing to see some brains instead of brawn in a superhero movie.

Another reason to to thank the gods is the expanding of Idris Elba's (that awesome charisma machine) character Heimdall, who, if not managing to *cancel* the apocalypse, at least delays it until further notice. Anthony Hopkins is gravely overqualified, but who cares - it's Hopkins and he's always excellent. Jamie Alexander, Rene Russo, and Natalie Portman each out-do their previous performances, and Kat Dennings is still absolutely hilarious. This is the most female-centric Marvel movie yet.

The action, including a dazzling aerial fight in Asgard, a brutal battle in an Asgardian prison, a twisty, unpredictable corker of a double-cross in the dark world, and a visually stunning and often hilarious climax of a battle...is some of the best I have seen Marvel put forth yet. It was always riveting and much appreciated.

In conclusion, Thor 2 sticks very closely to the tried-and-proven Marvel formula, meaning that there are some glitches and cliches. But on the whole, this is the best Marvel movie since The Avengers, and one of Marvel's best (certainly outpassing IM2, IM3, THOR, and HULK). Leave your brain at the door and enjoy. Thor 2 is a triumph. 4.5 convergences out of 5!

PS: As a total Norse mythology nut, I absolutely LOVED the mentions to Svartalfaheimr, Yggdrasil, and Midgard. I definitely recommend checking out the original myths; it makes the work Marvel has done so much more worthwhile! Cheers!",1386720000,223,3259,4.937956204379562
6085576,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. I wouldn't say it's quite as good as the first one, but extremely close. If you like super hero movies and/or the Marvel universe, you're going to enjoy this film. I can't wait to see it in 3d.",1386633600,2,230,4.372093023255814
6085577,4,B00GLPCKX8,"As a life long Marvel fan, I can say with certainty that THOR:THE DARK WORLD does justice to the great work of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and is a worthy followup to THE AVENGERS.  We get to follow some of our favorite characters from the latter movie, while expanding on the universe we saw in the first THOR movie.  To me, the script of the THE DARK WORLD could have been lifted right from the comic book with its plot concerning the Convergence of the Nine Realms and the revenge of the Dark Elves by way of weapon of mass destruction called the Aether.  If this sounds like mumbo jumbo, then this movie is not for you, but for us comic book fans, it is heaven.

Director Alan Taylor-taking over for Kenneth Branagh, who directed the first movie-keeps the action and the plot moving right along; even the necessary exposition doesn't drag the movie down and there is a lot of very welcome humor in the story.  THE DARK WORLD is not MAN OF STEEL (which I liked).  True, there is much CGI, especially in the scenes set in Asgard, but it is well used and we get the sense we are in well lived in alien world.  At slightly less than two hours, the movie has an epic look and feel, but not an epic length, which is appreciated.

Where THOR: THE DARK WORLD really shines is the way it develops characters we have already met in previous films and takes them to new places.  Thor is still cocky, but experience in battle as taken the edge off his arrogance and he's learned to think before he fights.  Jane Foster is far more than just the love interest/damsel in distress, but a brainy scientist who is up to the challenge and more than willing to risk letting her heart get broken.  Both Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman are perfect in their parts, making larger than life characters seem very real and human.

Best of all is the return of Tom Hiddleston's Loki in all his conniving glory; he's absolutely the best thing about the movie.  Imprisoned on Asgard after helping the Chitauri almost destroy New York in THE AVENGERS, Loki finds that he can be of use to his half brother when the Dark Elves lay waste to the Norse Guards realm and kidnap Jane (who has become the vassal containing The Aether).  Does Loki truly want to help defeat the enemy or is he merely an ally of momentary convenience?  This is what makes his character so compelling, helped in no small way by Hiddleston's terrific performance.

The big bad is Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, the leader of the Dark Elves; he's one of those Marvel staples: an ancient evil that lives for nothing but revenge.  Malekith's chief weapon is the Kurse and is portrayed by Abewale Akinnuoye-Adgbe, who was Mr. Echo on LOST.  There are lots of returning faces, such as Skellan Skarsgard, who's Dr. Selvig is still more than a little addled after the events of THE AVENGERS and Kat Dennings's Darcy, who gets a boyfriend this time around.  Zachary Levi, Idris Elba, Jamie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, and Rene Russo play various Asgardians, while Anthony Hopkins in his best stern and disapproving mode as Odin.  Of course, Stan Lee gets his customary cameo.  As does another pertinent Marvel hero.

I do think the screen writers do need to update their manuals somewhat, this is the second movie this year where we've seen a space ship crash into an Earth city-the other was STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS.  Is it something about having DARK in the title?

And the post credit scenes do deliver, one of which introduces a new character from the Marvel Universe and hints at troubles to come.",1386633600,4,3566,4.562009419152276

6085580,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The film opens with the defeat of Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with darkness called ""the ether"" apparently a hater of the cinema. He is defeated and the ether is hidden somewhere deep where it can't be found. Then the movie title hits the screen: ""Thor: The Dark World."" Not too hard to figure this one out and since Natalie Portman doesn't work for bus fare, you can bet she will be prominent in the film.

Chris Hemsworth provides us with some early beefcake moments for what is a borderline chick flick. I found Darcy (Kat Dennings) to be the most entertaining character in the film, too bad she was underutilized. The film excelled in special effects, but had a plot we could figure out before the title flashed on the screen, minus some details. Thor was played rather stiffly and made Loki (Tom Hiddleston) likeable. The writers need to lighten him up.

6085581,4,B00GLPCKX8,"This 2nd entry in the Thor franchise was somewhat better in scope than the 1st movie.

Although we liked the 1st movie, this one gave us more fantasy elements and having Thor having his Mjolnor hammer full-time, instead of waiting for him to turn into Thor or getting back his hammer.

Having the movie goers visiting other realms was a good idea. More action and differing scenes kept one glued to the screen and was never boring. This was a very different movie than any of the other super hero films, like the latest Wolverine was.

And in our opinion, both movies worked in that regard.

We really enjoyed this fresh take on the Thor mythos, with Loki stealing a lot of scenes and the Dark Elf angle, this Dark World movie was chock full of humor and total blazing action excitement.",1386028800,,787,4.52112676056338
6085582,5,B00GLPCKX8,"[Caveat: I have to confess that I'm a huge fan of the Marvel Thor mythology and have read the comics off and on through the years ever since I was a kid. I state that upfront so you understand that my review of this film is viewed through that lens. However, I still feel the film is fun and entertaining for everyone even if you're not that familiar with the character. There are at least three or four things in this film that are worth the price of admission alone.]

I can't imagine that a fan of the character Thor would be disappointed with this film. It builds on all the elements that Kenneth Branagh established in the first film and ups the ante across the board. Everything is bigger: the battles, the cast, the sets, the visual effects, the soundtrack, the entire scope. The costumes are amazing. I wish they looked this good the first time around. And Asgard is incredible. Alan Taylor has brought the eternal realm to life in a way that Branagh did not. It is still majestic but it feels much more real and actually ""lived in"".

Further, the actors from the first movie have really grown into their roles. Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular are the very embodiment of their characters. Hiddleston has much more material to work with from an actor's perspective with regards to Loki - a tormented and duplicitous soul - but he's so good at it. Whereas Hemsworth plays the cocksure Thor in a much more understated fashion. Thor is not complex but has a big heart. Bringing him to life requires subtlety and Hemsworth nails it. Neither actor oversells their role. Not only that, they have tremendous chemistry with each other and every scene in which they are together steals the show. As a fan who realizes how horribly wrong these movies could've gone with such an outrageous premise, I am so grateful that Marvel found these two actors to play the most vital parts of the story.

The creators of the film version of Thor had a difficult choice integrating into the universe and tone that Favreau established in the first Iron Man. In the comics, there's magic and there's sci fi and other dimensions and all that stuff and you just accept it. In the reality-based technology-centric world Iron Man created, how do you introduce a viking god from space who soars around with a magic hammer? In fact, Favreau even admitted he had no idea how it could be done. However, Branagh did find a way and he did it by emphasizing the science fiction aspects of the mythology Jack Kirby and Stan Lee concocted 50 years ago. Taylor now had the unenviable job of taking that idea and running with it without it falling apart at the seams. In my opinion he succeeded. The result is Dark Elves in space ships. It's a bizarre mix and maybe a lot of people won't get it. But it feels like a comic book sprung to life and I loved it.

The only legitimate complaint that I feel this movie deserves is that at times it feels too compressed. (However, I also felt that way about the first film.) It's amazing that for such a short run time The Dark World truly does feel epic, but there's so much going on in this story between Earth and Asgard and the other realms that things don't always get enough time to breathe. I believe this strategy of Marvel is to keep moving the story forward at a brisk pace for the grander scheme of things while maintaining the widest possible appeal for a broad audience - but I'd like to them to linger a little more in a juicy chapter like this. I think even 5 or 10 minutes of added scenes could've put this film over the top and helped flush out certain characters' motives and let you feel more attachment to them. Alan Taylor has said it was very difficult for him to cut out several scenes and is the first Marvel director who has said he'd be keen on doing a Director's Cut. Boy would I love to see that!

Things I liked about The Dark World:

* Character arc of Thor - Thor is growing wiser and shrewder but still retaining his bravado. The lessons he experienced in the first film have made him question things more in this one. His relationship with Odin ebbs and flows like real life and in this film we see that father and son are not so different from each other. In the end Thor makes a surprising choice that mirrors his actions from the comics.

* Character arc of Loki - Loki finds redemption - or does he? His motives are always ambiguous and questionable and he certainly is headed on a darker path. However, the events that unfold here give you more insight into who he is and why he does the things he does

* The funeral scene - Not wanting to spoil things here but you'll know it when you see it. Amazing.

* Sci-fi/fantasy mashup - Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. The comics was always a weird juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous ideas and this film embraces it and it works.

* Algrim the Kursed - wow! This guy is scary.

* Fun plot twists - Loki isn't the only trickster in this film!

* Thor and Jane Foster make a cute pair - others may disagree but their romance to me is very innocent and sweet and I feel she plays the starry eyed scientist bit to a tee. It's not a huge part of the film but their scenes work and it helps humanize Thor and keep him connected to Earth. I also am very old fashioned and I love how gallantly protective Thor is of Jane and I love that she is equally protective of him.

* Creative battle scenes - especially the last one which produces some ridiculous situations and leave's Thor's hammer Mjolnir VERY confused!

* A healthy dose of humor injected to keep the film from ever taking itself too seriously but not overdone

* Stellan Skarsgrd as Erik Selvig - you see that Tony Stark is not the only one impacted by the events of Avengers. This man is a genius but Loki's mind games have really messed him up. Even so Skarsgrd is a tremendous actor and really sells it. I enjoyed his part of the story and how he unravels the mystery of the convergence despite his mental state.

Bottom line this film is fun escapism ala Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Don't expect poignant existential validation or heavy handed political commentary. This film is a good time. It's also an exciting chapter in a much larger story that is the MCU. Enjoy the ride!",1386028800,535,6242,4.41007819287576
6085583,3,B00GLPCKX8,"So at this point, comic book movie fans are watching every Marvel movie to keep ""The Avengers"" flame alive.  It's certainly why I keep watching ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" despite its mediocre plotlines and acting, and it's what lured me to ""Iron Man 3"" (even though Iron Man didn't need any help).  So watching ""Thor: The Dark World"" has become a necessity just to get all the inside jokes from the Marvel marketing juggernaut. Despite the world-shattering implications, not a whole lot happens.

""The Dark World"" begins with the dark elves, an evil race hell bent on reclaiming the universe with dark matter using a magical weapon of mass destruction called the Aether. These elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), and he uses dark matter to create killing machines known as the Kursed. Defeated by Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) predecessor Bor (Tony Curran), the dark elves have since gone into hibernation, waiting for the right moment to return and wield the Aether once more.  In case you're wondering, these dark elves do not wear a hooded cloak and wield two swords -- and until later, their skin is pale white, not dark black.

Stumbling into this mess is poor Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), our super-smart damsel in distress who just happens to pass between worlds and absorb the Aether.  It seems the Aether likes to live inside people, making Jane a Distress Ball -- a character to be batted back and forth between Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Odin, and Malekith.  Girl meets god, bad guy steals girl, god saves her and the nine worlds.  You get the idea.

Where ""The Dark World"" rises above its mediocre plot is when Thor teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  Loki chews the scenery with glee, and the half-brothers' shared pain makes them a snarky combination that's a pleasure to watch. It doesn't last nearly long enough, and in no time Loki's back to being sneaky and Thor's back to hitting things with Meow-Meow -- Dary Lewis' (Kat Dennings) name for Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.

The special effects are excellent, including Hemsworth with his shirt off, but that's simply obscuring the fact that despite a planar conjunction and a battle for the universe, ""The Dark World"" feels trite.  It's not that ""The Dark World"" is bad, it's just that it's not up to the quality of the other Marvel movies.",1385942400,6,2304,4.849489795918367
6085584,5,B00GLPCKX8,"THE MOVIE:
Now, I am a lady who enjoys her some Thor. So this movie could be 20 minutes of him reading the paper and I'd give it 5 stars. That being said, it really is a great movie. Better than the first, I'd say. I felt the first movie had more character development and set up (ie nothing really happened). This movie definitely had more action, but the interaction between all the characters, particularly Thor & Loki, was what made great.

I have watched this movie over a dozen times (I play it in the bkgd while I work) and it makes for great company. Some standout moments for me are:
The music
The acting (except for Jane, she just doesn't fit for me)
The costumes
The plot (I'm not a technical nerd, so any holes are lost on me)
The levity (some very funny moments)
The Thor (Gratuitous shirtless scene!)
The funeral scene. I find myself watching this every time. It's just very well done. Beautiful.

As popcorn-muncher flicks go this movie was a pleasure. Remember to stay tuned after the credits - TWICE - for extra content!

THE DVD:
I'm not one to be suckered in by extra discs and downloads, and the standard DVD edition is perfect for me. Could be cheaper, though!",1385856000,3,1181,4.433179723502304
6085585,1,B00GLPCKX8,"One of the worst movies of 2013, this is the second chapter in the adventures of Thor the Cosmic Douchebag and his magical hammer. Spoiler alert: this is the one where, despite living for thousands of years, with a duty to protect all life in the whole universe, he falls in love with Jane, a human mortal who will die in about 40 years. She also happens to be Earths dumbest astrophysicist.

But Im getting ahead of myself. The movie begins a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, where some bad guys are fighting some good guys. You can tell who the bad guys are because they are called Dark Elves. Their warriors are called Kursed, and they are apparently the only beings in the entire universe that don't speak English.  Anyway, the Dark Elves want to take some red mist called the Aether, which is the most powerful weapon in the universe, and kill everyone (yes, theres a lot of talk about the universe in this movie. You cant get more epic than that.) Luckily, Thors grandfather wins, and hides the most powerful weapon in the universe in a rock.

Fast forward to present day. Some kind of convergence of the Nine Realms of the universe is getting ready to happen, and its focused on England. This makes parts of Earth act all wacky. Janes science team finds one of these places - if you throw things into it, it makes them disappear. So they decide to throw their car keys into it. Then Jane decides to wander off by herself. She runs into the rock that hides the Aether, and it infects her, which wakes up the bad guys. Then some other stuff happens that is even less believable.

Visually, the movie is interesting. Even though a lot of it is copied from Star Wars movies, its still fun to let it bounce off your eyeballs. Unfortunately, thats the only positive thing I can say about the movie. The script is not just bad, its embarrassing. For a plot that revolves around the laws of physics, none of the three screenwriters seem to have heard of it (pro tip, guys: putting the word quantum in front of other words doesnt count as an explanation. Oh, and a physicist would never exclaim, It will tear the fabric of reality apart!).

Thor is such a fratboy Superhero that its impossible to take him seriously. He tosses his hair around, flexes his muscles, and likes to party. He stops wars and saves the day multiple times on multiple planets, but then he gets all weepy over some puny earth girl that he just met and who will be dead before he has time to hit the gym.

The movie is stupid, silly, and boring. It has about as much suspense and depth as a television commercial. The cinematic equivalent of a pony keg of Keystone Light, it will actually make you dumber by consuming it.",1385769600,34,2700,4.422535211267606
6085586,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Of all the superheroes who have made the leap from page to screen, Thor has been the biggest surprise, if only because he breaks so clearly from the most well established superhero narratives.  The most common blueprint for the superhero film finds an altruistic young man struggling with doing the right thing only to be given extraordinary powers that change his life and the world around him (see Spider Man and Captain America).  This narrative nicely fits within the heros journey narrative Hollywood has loved at least since Star Wars.  And then theres the popular superhero narrative of a billionaire deciding to give himself to his community by mustering his extraordinary talents and wealth (see Batman and Iron Man).  The advantage of this kind of story is that the heros astounding wealth can ground the events in a world that looks a lot like our own, minimizing the audiences suspension of disbelief.  But the world of Thor is a strange amalgamation of superheroes, mythology, fantasy, and science fiction.  In short, it is a bizarre hodgepodge of influences that only seem to fit together within the logic of comic books.

And yet somehow the first Thor film worked.  A lot of the credit goes to Kenneth Branagh who embraced the loopier aspect of the hero, but still managed to ground the narrative with a combination of mythological family drama and a 1980s fish out of water comedy.  Despite the first films laborious finale, the movie succeeded on the merits of everyone involved.  The sequel, Thor: The Dark World, continues to expand on Thors universe, spending more time off earth and in the various Nine Realms.

Thor: The Dark World opens once again with that ponderous signifier of the fantasy genre: the voiceover.  (I understand how this might be necessary in some situations, especially with the overwhelmingly large universe of J.R.R. Tolkein, but there has got to be a better way to build a fantasy world in the medium of film).  Odins voiceover introduces Malekith, the films villain who hopes to destroy the universe using a powerful weapon known as the Aether, a maroon sometimes liquid, sometimes solid object that also appears to have a mind of its own.  Malekiths plans are stymied by Bor, Thors grandfather.  But he wakes thousands of years later, at a time when the Nine Realms are in alignment, which, lucky for Malekith, is apparently the ideal time for their destruction. This Convergence has shred the boundaries between worlds, which leads Thor love interest and scientific expert in technobabble, Jane Foster to become infected by the Aether.

Malekith isn't a particularly compelling villain.  His motivations are murky at best, and its clear that his sole job is to move the plot forward.  But luckily the much more compelling villain from the first film and The Avengers, Loki, has also returned.  For the first part of the film, Loki remains locked up on Asgard for his crimes, and he only gets released when Thor decides he needs his help to hunt down Malekith.  At this point its hard to imagine a Thor film without Loki.  His charismatic trickster has become the kind of villain you hate yourself for actually rooting for.  Likewise, Chris Hemsworth excels at being unselfconsciously charming as Thor, and Anthony Hopkins manages to be both grizzled and regal as Odin.

But if there is one aspect of The Dark War that compares unfavorably with its predecessor, its a fumbling of the Thor, Loki, and Odin dynamic.  Kenneth Branagh at first seemed like an odd choice for a superhero film, but watching the first film, it became clear that Branaghs knowledge of Shakespeare made him ideal to explore the relationship between a family of royals (Im sure Im not the only person to recognize parallels between Thor and Prince Hal/Henry V).  This is most evident in the character of Odin.  In the first film, Branagh and Hopkins crafted a complex image of a king who excelled at war and yet hated violence, who loved his sons and yet feared for their future.  When Odin banishes Thor, Hopkins plays the character as stern but melancholy.  In the sequel, Hopkins is given little to do but to stomp around being gruff.

But in general perhaps the biggest asset the Thor films have is a cast intent on ignoring how downright goofy, if fun, the material is and giving performances that craft as fully realized characters as possible, even if their screen time is scant.  Ray Stevenson, Jaimie Alexander, Tadanobu Asano, and Zachary Levi (replacing Josh Dallas) all manage to make the most of their archetypal adventurers even while relegated to the periphery.  Each character could potentially anchor an entire film, so long as they also had a comic book named after them.  As for the earthlings, Stellan Skarsgard turns in a more comedic performance this time around, and Kat Denning manages to barely skirt annoying and manages to be funny.  The Thor films have enough characters to fuel five more movies without relying on the larger Marvel universe.

The Dark World is directed by Alan Taylor who has worked primarily in television, most relevantly directing a number of episodes of Game of Thrones.  His biggest contribution to the Nine Realms is providing a more lived in feel to Asgard and a heavy infusion of sci-fi elements.  Branagh embraced the comic book origins, making liberal use of Dutch tilts and bright colors.  And while these are taken directly from the art of Thor co-creator Jack Kirby, Taylors slightly grimier vision works better on the big screen. Taylor seems heavily influenced by George Lucas circa 1977 to 1983.  Not only does he create a world with a little dirt and grime, but he also melds science fiction with fantasy.  The races of the Nine Realms are just as comfortable battling with sword and shield as they are space fighters.  This goes a long way towards really showcasing what a strange, baroque world Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have created, but grounding it for the film going audience.

The Dark World is a case of one step forward and one step back.  Unlike in the first film, the plot moves along lithely, but in order to do so it has abandoned the psychological depth that differentiated the first film from other superhero movies.  But when this superhero craze started a few years ago, no one really expected a Thor film in the first place.  Asgard and the Nine Realms seemed so loopy, so melded to the page that a film seemed impossible.  Comic books have the potential to present an image of unfettered imagination at work.  The Thor films have shown that, despite the odds, this can translate to the screen.",1385683200,3,6594,4.847321428571429
6085587,4,B00GLPCKX8,"When Marvel Comics was ramping up its ""Phase One"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it seemed like the hardest character to get to connect with an audience was a Norse demigod. You had a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist who wore a metal suit and fought bad guys; you had a meek scientist that could turn into the strongest being on the planet; you had a brave and good-hearted weakling that was turned into a super-soldier to fight the ultimate earthly evil. But a dreamy god of Norse legend that threw a big hammer around? How could they make that work? Thanks to some star-making performances by Chris Hemsworth as the titular god of thunder and Tom Hiddleston as the seductive and duplicitous god of mischief, and quality supporting performances by the likes of Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, and Anthony Hopkins, as well as solid direction by Kenneth Branagh, we had a really good time with the first THOR. And after the events of THE AVENGERS, where Thor and Loki played a large part in, we felt even better about these charcters. Now, it's time for ""Phase Two"", and a new ancient evil threatens all of existence and it's time for Thor to pick up Mjolnir again and for the Asgardians to take up arms and defend all the nine realms in THOR: THE DARK WORLD.

The Nine Realms are reaching an era of peace that Thor and his compatriots of the Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander, reprising), and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, reprised by Ray Stevenson; Hogun, reprised by Tadanobu Asano, and Fandral. played by Zachary Levi replacing Joshua Dallas) look to stop the forces that threaten the peace on the separate realms, and Loki rots in a cell, with only his mother Frigga (Rene Russo, reprising) as a visitor. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Jane Foster (Portman, reprising), Darcy (Dennings, reprising) and Erik Selvig (Skarsgard, reprising) are investigating a very strange anomaly in London. This anomaly ties to a long-lost power once wielded by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svarltleheim want to use to remake the universe into nothingness again (as it once was, as explained in a spectacular prelude by Odin, again reprised by Hopkins). This power infects Jane, the love of Thor's life and he appears once again on Earth to whisk her away to Asgard. She meets his family and friends, but is soon falling victim to the infection of the power coursing through her. And Malekith, drawn to this power, attacks Asgard and causes a tragic death that spurs Thor to take the fight to Malekith and the remainder of the Dark Elves. But on order to get there, they must first free Loki, who has reasons of his own to stop Malekith. So Thor and Loki and Jane escape Asgard as fugitives to the barren wasteland of Svartleheim, and the fight continues on Earth as Thor and Malekith face off for the fate of the universe.

Firstly, the film is much more visually stunning than the first one. Alan Taylor (a director of many great TV shows such as ROME, DEADWOOD, and THE SOPRANOS, but perhaps most famous for his work on GAME OF THRONES) replaces Branagh as the director here, and has the benefit of a much more remarkable visual palette to work with, with much of the film taking place in Asgard, but every place they go just looks more detailed than what was previously seen in the original. Secondly, the film has a much more distinct comic book feel to it thanks to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (this is the second of three Marvel films they've written together; firstly with CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, then this, and soon the upcoming CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) as well as Christopher Yost, a great comic writer in his own right as well as the creative force behind the greatest of the Marvel cartoons, such as AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES and WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN. So there's a lot of behind-the-scenes talent at work. In front of the screen, there is, as with most sequels, more of an opportunity to expand character and not focus so much on exposition. You really get the feeling that with three films under his belt as the same character that Hemsworth is absolutely 100% comfortable as Thor. He exudes the strength, courage, sacrifice, charm and hard-headedness that the character is most known for. The other Asgardians get some more time as well, with more exposure for Sif and the Warriors Three and especially for the all-seeing guardian Heimdall (reprised by Idris Elba, whose work in films like PACIFIC RIM and shows like LUTHER seem to require he gets more screentime). Sadly, this is where the film makes some mistakes, though. Only the wonderfully funny Dennings gets more to do in this film from a character standpoint. Portman seems to be almost woefully underused here. She seems to be either a damsel-in-distress or a device for advancing the plot of those around her. The great Christopher Eccleston has almost nothing to do here except for appear in freaky makeup and look and sound menacing. At least the villain of the first film was given something to do, and it would have greatly benefitted the film if Malekith were allowed to speechify a bit to give his character a little more gravity.

However, if this villain is a little on the weak side, it's only because this film's other ""villain"" is so incredibly strong, and of course, I'm talking about the genius of Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He walks away with this film, as he did from a performance standpoint in THE AVENGERS. The first film spent a good deal of time with Hemsworth and Hiddleston evenly balanced, and while Thor has more screentime, once Loki is on screen, all eyes must divert to him. Hiddleston's performance is so magnetic, so sleekly charming and so smartly crafted that he's created one of the great screen characters, let alone screen villains, in recent years. The scene where he and Thor are walking together as Loki keeps changing forms (and creates a BRILLIANT cameo) is easily the best scene in the film.

The thing that I felt most about this film after it was over, aside from how interesting and exciting and epic the film felt was that there is a longer version of this film somewhere. The film clocks in at an exceedingly brisk 112 minutes (and that's including TWO post-credits sequences), and I think there's more there that maybe was cut for budgetary constraints, because I can't think of this film cropping anything for time when it's that short.

All in all, THOR: THE DARK WORLD is by far the better of the two ""Phase Two"" films that Marvel released this year thanks to a stronger story, stronger performances, and a greater dedication to the comic book ideals that make these great characters who they are.",1385251200,5,6709,4.770223752151463

I was completely caught up in their complicated relationship. Good twists and turns, fun battles, beautiful imagery, well scripted. I am a long time fan of Marvel, and Thor was always my favorite charcter. I feel the movies really bring the characters to life. This movie rocked, I can't wait for Thor #3!

We loved this movie even more so than the first - which was excellent in its own right!

What's not: The connection to actual Norse mythology is not just thin, here, it's worn clean through in most places. All that's left, really, is a threadbare shred held together by references to a few of the Old Gods' names. I mean, c'mon - Norse gods, zap guns, and hand grenades? Really? It's possible to put a movie like this together by interpolating within the tradition, adding detail to the classic stories, or even extrapolating just a bit closer to the original canon.

But, if you can mentally cut off any memory you ever had of the traditional sir and their stories, it's a fair action flick with lots of great effects (did I mention them?). Enjoy the popcorn, and get your kids some books of the original myths. Really.

6085593,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The special effects are amazing, attractive and gigantic.

The action is non-stop. Yet, 45 minutes into the movie, the excitement substantially subsides. It's because Thor's fighting skills look very limited. He whacks the enemies with his hammer; he flies; he throws punches; he slams his body against the opponents. That's all. It's repetitive to the point of boring after watching those scenes for a while.

Adding to the problem above, there's very little character depth. The film barely touches brotherhood and father-and-son relationship.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, as of today, Dec. 12, 2013, below are the financial figures of this movie:

Release Date: Nov. 8, 2013
Production Budget: $170 million
Domestic:  $194,618,631
+ Foreign:  $416,700,000
= Worldwide:  $611,318,631

6085595,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I went into this movie cautiosly optimistic because of two reasons: (1) sequels usually fall short of the original and (2) Thor is the most unique of the Avengers (not being from earth, he's a God instead of a human, etc.).  My expectations were completely blown away.  This is one of a few sequels that I think are better than the original.  I personally liked the original, but the character depth and storyline in this sequel are much better.  Everything from camera angles to balance of action scenes was done extremely well.  If you're a fan of Thor/Avengers and Game of Thrones, then this is the love child of those two franchises.  Coincidentally, this was directed by one of the directors from Game of Thrones and you can see some of those tones here in this movie.

This movie also has some decent setups for future Marvel Phase 2 movies as well.  Stay for the mid-credit extra scene and you'll see the biggest of these setups.

Marvel likes to remind its audience about its larger universe of characters that are tied together.  The hints here and there for referencing the larger Marvel universe are mostly done well, except a few, but those aren't by any means a bad thing.  Some of them just felt like a little bit of a stretch in an effort to get something in there.

Then the battles itself was like no more than 5 minutes each battle. So if you are expecting a ending(or near the ending) showdown battle where both sides are at it for like 10 or 15 mins than nope nothing to see here. I don't even think thor is all that he is hyped up to be. I'd put iron man over thor after seeing this movie. It seems like thor has become this snuggly bunny care-bear like guy with the story of this movie and even the last thor.

I am a huge, huge, fan of Loki, and as far as he is concerned, Loki definitely throws fans and audiences for a loop a few times throughout the movie, and gets plenty of screen time (in the post-production phase, the production team actually decided to film extra scenes featuring Loki since he has such a huge fanbase).

Even if you're not a Loki fan, there is definitely plenty to enjoy about this movie. The balance between drama and comedy is a precarious one, but is balanced very well here, especially in the climactic scenes. There were definitely MANY hilarious moments in the movie, most of them hinging on brilliant snark and one-liners., another one featuring a very memorable cameo. The movie does get very emotional at some moments, so be sure to have tissues with you. There are two plot points in particular that the trailers for this movie did not include at all--people familiar with the Thor 2 trailers will find that this completely alters their assumptions of what the movie is about.

DO watch this movie! You may cry, you will definitely laugh a lot, and you will most probably be hanging on the edge of your seat for a good portion of it! It's two hours very well spent.",1384646400,7,1248,4.542222222222223

There were a few cheesy moments and those seemed to be the ones shown on TV interviews, which made me worry a bit for the movie's success. However, it absolutely did not disappoint and those scenes blended with the rest of the film wonderfully. I think Loki was written much more truly to his God of Mischief roots, what with his sarcasm, jokes, and teasing of his brother. There was real drama, serious plot twists, but it was a super fun ride and, as the title of my review noted, I will absolutely be buying this the moment it comes out.

6085601,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor: The Dark World is another well done film in a long line of excellent Marvel Universe movies. If you had to ask me my favorite Marvel character, Thor would be pretty far down the list, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Once again, the acting was solid all around. There is less of a character journey for Thor this go around as he has settled in to his humbler and more thoughtful warrior role, but we do see some new dimensions to the Loki character. We get to see a lot more of Asgard and Thors family this time around. There are lots of scenes where you can easily believe you are watching a Lord of the Rings style fantasy, but the underlying science fiction is still there, especially in the final act. The climactic battle includes some very creative use of space portals to make the fight different than anything I have ever seen before. I believe there are even more moments of humor than the first, and all are well placed and well delivered.

One question I had going into the movie was how would they create a significant enough threat to match the power levels of Thor, but at the same time making it plausible that the other Avengers wouldnt become involved. Given that we have this connected universe, it makes sense that if something major goes down on Earth all the Avengers would once again assemble. Thor: The Dark World gets around this pretty well by putting a very short clock on the action happening on Earth, so that it is easy to believe nobody else would have time to react, thus leaving Thor to handle this threat without any Avengers backup. I look forward to seeing more of this character, especially in the future Avengers movie.",1384473600,2,1672,4.518151815181518
6085602,4,B00GLPCKX8,"- Loki (facing judgment from Odin the Allfather re his war crimes): ""I really don't see what the fuss is about.""

The heart of this film beats neither to the great romance between the Earth woman and the Odinson nor to a dark elf's vengeance that has seethed the span of the life of the universe. See THOR: THE DARK WORLD for the otherworldly grandeur and the larger-than-life characters and heroes fighting off an extinction-level threat and for the occasional drops of humor. But it'll impress on you soon enough that what anchors the narrative is the robust, complex, love-hate interplay between Thor and his step-brother Loki.

You've probably learned your lesson from when you ducked out early the last time, but do stay for the two post-credit stingers.

Maybe you should know that, every five thousand years, there is the Convergence, an event of mere minutes in which the Nine Realms are perfectly aligned. Maybe you react to that cosmic reveal in zen-like manner; you could be like that Buddhist who went up to the hot dog vendor and said, ""Make me one with everything."" Or you could react like Malekith, him what bears an almighty grudge against the universe and so seeks its undoing. Good cess to you and me and the Buddhist with the hot dog, the dread dark elf was stymied millennia ago, his ancient weapon of choice, the Aether, destroyed. Or so it was thought the Aether was destroyed.

Ain't it just like a dude? For two years Jane Foster has abided, waiting for her Asgardian to return like he said he would. Blame the trickster god, Loki, for Thor's big delay. Loki's misdeeds - specifically, those concerning the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge - have bred chaos in the Nine Realms. When not in New York smiting invading not-Skrulls, Thor's been preoccupied with restoring order across the Nine Realms. Still, Odin the Allfather has noted his son's confused heart. Odin tries to steer Thor's attention towards the beautiful and fierce Lady Sif. I'm down with that. I'm on Team Sif. We the movie-going audience could've used more of her and more of the Warriors Three. And maybe less of that pantsless astrophysicist (no, it's not Jane).

By the way, it's nice to see ""Chuck Bartowski"" get himself another gig.

Jane Porter, astrophysicist (with pants on), plays a critical role. She's in fact at the very core of the plot, which I guess is a fortuitous thing because, else, why have Thor come to Earth at all? I'll just say that, as the story opens, she's still in deep mopes about her missing thunder god when she hears word of a ""stable gravitational anomaly"" in London. Off she goes to investigate, catalyst to the plot and this time laden with more spunk.

For those wishing that Thor would explore more of the Nine Realms and more of his relationship with his fellow Asgardians (including Loki), done and done (and done). Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston have done wonders to promote sibling rivalry. I feel like starting a feud with my brother myself, that dirtbag. Hiddleston is again remarkable. His performance full of layers. From having viewed the trailers, it's understood that there's a big bad out there bigger and badder than Loki. But don't dismiss this god of mischief, don't sell short his craving to rule and his towering rage and just how plain sneaky he is. He's the best kind of villain, compelling, intelligent, someone you can't help but like and maybe even root for. That charismatic deceiver.

For the comic book reader there's a grip of gratification. I swear that giant rock monster that Thor faces in fleeting single combat is of the same alien species he tangled with in his debut in JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 (1962). Malekith, of course, is an old foe, as is Kurse. Somewhere, Walt Simonson has got to have this wee smile. Maybe he's waiting for the Frog of Thunder arc to be adapted to cinema.

Is it better than the first film? I dunno. Certainly the mythology is richer. I think THOR: THE DARK WORLD is worth paying to see (even the 3D doesn't suck), never mind that the narrative beats won't club you over the head with the originality stick and that the Asgardian dialogue comes off like Shakespeare in his cups. Never mind that Eccleston's Malekith inspires jaded shrugs more than invested hisses. And that we're once more subjected to that familiar ego stroke wherein humanity - or, in this case, Earth - turns out to be the focal point of the universe. Nngh. Well, what matters is that it's a visually arresting movie. The CG and the practical set pieces wonderfully evoke the glorious spectacle of Asgard and the ashen desolation of the dark elves' world of Svartalfheim. When I Mapquested the route from my house to Svartalfheim, the thing said the distance was two trillion miles. I don't have that kind of gas. Anyway, the movie does well in rounding out certain corners in the Thor universe. It's got this terrific fish-out-of-water element, only it's not Thor this time who's out of his element. It's a cast that represents. Hemsworth is comfy and commanding in the thunder god's burly skin. And while Natalie Portman improves on her performance from the first film - because she's given more to do here - I still think Thor is dumb as hammers for ignoring Sif. I just couldn't take my eyes off Jaimie Alexander. Rene Russo doesn't have a lot of camera time, but she shines when onscreen and demonstrates that Frigga, the gentle Asgardian Queen, can flip instantly into a complete badass warrior woman. In that one fighty fight she was in, I kept expecting to see Riggs and Murtaugh in the background cheering her on.

6085603,3,B00GLPCKX8,"""It's a different world. Maybe they were different for a reason."" Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa. After receiving familiar signals on her equipment Jane and crew check out the source. What they find not only reunites them with Thor but also endangers Earth, Asgard and the entire universe. Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one. As always don't forget to keep watching through the credits...there are two extra scenes! I give it a B.",1384300800,11,1591,4.289036544850498
6085604,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I was expecting this movie to be good even though Branagh wasn't at the helm. Well the movie was great!
way better than the first thor, miles ahead from the disappointing Iron Man 3 (worst Iron Man), and maybe, the best superhero movie of the year as it is very close to awesomeness  with Superman and Wolverine.
---Strong Points---
 The acting is superb. From the main characters (Loki is so unbelievably good)to even the smallest characters, each one adds so well to the movie (Russo was fantastic too!). Of course the script helps the actors but they elevate their characters so much.. Portman was good (from being bad in the first Thor), Elba was great, thor was ...thor and Hopkins is of course on the top league. Loki gives the best performance of his life and I wish I saw this actor on a play or something on Broadway (snt far from Worcester!). That being sad the only superhero movie that could surpass this one in terms of good actors both in quantity and quality would probably be the upcoming x-men. If the script helps them that much as here.
 There is action far more than the first movie and there is sci fi. If Superman was 35% scifi this one is 80% sci fi but that is something good than bad...the rest of the 20% is magic!!
 Story is good, good villains....5 out of 5 stars
---Negative points---
There is no need to try and find negative points here...Its a super hero movie, its gonna have flaws but nothing important really. I left the movies feeling great even though  a little bit dizzy from the 3d.
  Far better than Iron Man 3 which was a disappointment especially when everybody was saying how good it was (I don't get how people compare things anymore. something is good or bad related to something else unless it is something entirely new)
So Iron man 3 was inferior to the other 2 and bad compared with the rest of the superhero movies.
Thor was better than the first in all aspects, and possibly the best superhero movie of this year and second as a whole movie only to Gravity.",1384300800,,2007,4.467213114754099

6085606,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor: The Dark World is not only infinitely better than Iron Man 3 in terms of Marvel's post-Avengers phase two, but is also (in my opinion) THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE to date. Words cannot describe how thrilled and satisfied I was after seeing it... you must watch it for yourself. I was always partial to the Hulk and Iron Man, whose films were increasingly disappointing until The Avengers came out. The first Thor was good but not great, and Captain America: The First Avenger exceeded my expectations... however, Thor: The Dark World surpasses them all. 'Nuff said!",1384300800,2,565,4.835051546391752
6085607,3,B00GLPCKX8,"This is a very funny and entertaining movie, I would highly recommend it. It doesn't have the emotional punch of the first one, and the theme music is very bland. The rousing theme from the first film is sorely missed.",1384300800,2,218,4.475
6085608,2,B00GLPCKX8,"I know that I'm going against the trend of rave reviews here, but if I'm going to be honest, I was really disappointed by Thor: The Dark World.  For all its eye-popping CGI and grand cosmic scale, the film really seems to alternate between constant unrelenting exposition for the first half and then going to the opposite extreme with bewildering jumping about that frequently seems to generate more heat than light, especially when it comes to understanding what's supposed to be happening (other than the most basic 'good guys trying to stop bad guys from destroying the universe' anyway).

It's not the fault of the actors. Chris Hemsworth delivers once in fine form once again as Thor. And Tom Hiddleston's Loki... what can I say?  Tom Hiddleston _is_ a god, stealing every scene he's in. Let Asgard and Earth fall! It'd be worth it just to get to watch Hiddleston's Loki gloat over it. Idris Elba's Heimdall once again lends some much needed somber gravitas to the scenes he's in, but it's Zachary Levi's Fandral who really brings on the Errol Flynn/Douglas Fairbanks panache of Asgard being a place where the Norse gods lived for the sheer joy of a good fight. I just wish they had him in more scenes, along with Jaimie Alexander's warrior goddess Sif who kicks her fair share of ass, holding her own with Thor on the battlefield in the all-too-brief scenes she's in. Kat Dennings as Jane's intern Darcy Lewis again brings perky comic relief, teamed this time with her own hapless and much put-upon sub-intern, Jonathan Howard's Ian, to great effect.

On the disappointing side though, Ray Stevenson - an actor whose work I generally love - is once again completely wasted as Volstagg, because the script gives him little to say and even less to do and makes no attempt at all to bring out the character's grand Falstaffian humor. But it's Natalie Portman - an actress again whom I generally love - whose Jane Foster unfortunately creates the biggest drag on the acting side. Aside from the serious problem that the plot renders her a passive pawn for almost the entire film and the script leaves her only banal dialogue to work with, there's simply no chemistry between her and Hemsworth's Thor. None, nada, zip.  Which makes all of Thor's motivation for her being the great love of his existence all seem rather fake and flat. This is made all the more painfully clear by the scenes between Thor and Sif where, if only briefly, you see some real man/woman feeling on display. Hell, even Darcy and Ian, the interns, have more chemistry going than Thor and Jane.

There's no real point in trying to explain the plot beyond 'dark elves want to destroy the realms and Thor must stop them to save not only the realms but his one great love'. Partly because it's going to be explained to you from the minute the film starts. And then explained some more by various characters explaining things to each other. And then explained yet some more, in case you somehow missed out on the first three lumps of exposition.  In point of fact, most of the first half of the film consists of characters constantly explaining things. Unfortunately, none of this ends up mattering because no amount of explaining can make any real sense of what's happening in the film, let alone make you care about it. The more they explain, the less you want to hear.  Basically, just think ""midi-chlorians"" from Star Wars. Yeah, it's like that.

The CGI is fantastic and eye-catching, but after a while you start to feel awash in it, particularly when it starts to get in the way of understanding what's happening. And in the way of seeing more of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. He really is the best thing in the movie, bringing it to full life when he's on the screen and letting it sink back into meaningless tedium when he's not. The man can do more with an ever-so-slight smirk or a wounded puppy-dog look than most actors can do with a full page of Oscar-worthy dialogue.

One minor thing that I found rather distracting - though it may have been just me - was that the armor and helmets the dark elf foot soldiers were wearing in the big battle scenes seemed way too reminiscent of the look of the Cybermen from the older Doctor Who incarnations.  I kept expecting the Tardis to sudden materialize in the middle of the battle.

A couple of final notes. As always, Stan Lee has a cameo you can watch for.  And there are two end-credits scenes to catch, the first particularly intriguing as it not only suggests what might be coming next, it introduces a new character played by a very well-known and talented actor you'll probably recognize.

In the end, except for the humorous bits and the chance to see Tom Hiddleston doing Loki once again, not really recommended for anyone but die-hard fans of the first Thor film.",1384214400,19,4792,4.655621301775148
6085609,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor Dark World is the second in the Marvel Universe of great comics films. Marvel continues their excellent portrayal of their universe picking up where we left off with the last Avengers film.

Family:

Loki clearly has family issues. His father is disgusted with him, considering that Lokis fate should have been dying on one of the Nine Worlds than being taken in by Asgard. Loki is jealous of Thor, cannot be trusted and has several tricks that are evident in the film.

Lokis ability to trick through changing his appearance is used to great effect. Hilarious scene where he changes into Captain America!

The tension between Lokis mother Frida and his brother Thor is quite intense at times and lends some realism to this fantasy tale.

Odin:

The All Father gets to shoot a few power blasts at the Dark Elves, gives us a closer look at the mythology of the time. Really liked that the film went more for the Asgard realm and the mythology of the time rather than staying mostly on small-town Earth.

Malekith:

Not a bad villain. Hes the leader of the Dark Elves, and the actor who portrays this character is trying to play it cool and subdued. But I like my villains active and energetic than subdued. My Marvel fan friends took offense on how Malekith is portrayed. But heck, its fiction, right? Malekith wants to collapse the Nine Worlds and after thousands of years (great back story) he makes another try at it.

Jane Foster inadvertently loses the Aether, an interesting Tesseract of power, that some internet blogs figure might lead us to the other Marvel tales of the Infinity Gauntlet. Perhaps so. This stuff is pretty evil; I don't understand why Jane could not have used it against the Elves but thats fine.

Romance:

Yeah, a bit of that. We have a few scenes between Thor and Jane. Even between Janes assistant and her intern.

Comedy:

The director really went overboard on the comedy. I don't mind one or two scenes to break up the seriousness of the story, but a new skit every five or ten minutes was a bit much, but I feel thats really a matter of taste.

Bottom Line:

Great fight scenes, though it was disturbing to see Thor being mopped up all over the place. The overall themes of family, of betrayal and of love & honor were well-displayed. Cant wait for the final film in the trilogy.

There are two extra scenes at the credits and after the credits. Dont miss them!

6085610,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor the Dark World was fun. Honestly, I don't expect deep themes and heavy drama from my Super-Hero movies so I'm rarely disappointed. As much as I loved Thor (the original) I love this one MUCH more. The characters have already been introduced to audiences, so in this round they undergo the development that was lacking in the first.

Thor is no longer the bombastic, arrogant juvenile that he was in his first film. His first priority is to restore peace to the nine realms, as it should be. He's heir to the throne of Asgard, after all. But he's distracted by thoughts of Jane Foster, the woman he didn't get to see the last time he was on Earth. ;) He checks in on her by asking Heimdal (who can see almost everything in the nine realms) how she's doing.

Loki is angry, lonely, sad, an explosive... and that's just while he's in prison. After the events of The Avengers, he's been locked up, isolated from the only person he loves: his mother, Frigga. In desperation, he even conjures an illusion of her simply to have someone to talk to. When Thor finally comes to him for help (another desperate act) all he can promise is his rage and desire for revenge as assurance that he won't betray Thor yet again.

We don't get enough of Jane in Thor and The Dark World to see how much she might have grown over the past two-and-a-half years, but she's an honest person, intelligent, and strong-willed. I have no problem believing that Thor would fall for her. I was satisfied with the 'ship in this sequel, wishing for more, but knowing a PG-13 comic-based movie wouldn't be able to deliver. The second tag scene (yes, there are TWO, just like after The Avengers) sated my shipper's desires.

I think the most delightful part of the film was Mjolnir, Thor's hammer. You'll have to see the film to understand.

Overall, the film is a fun ride with real peril and several laughs. I can't wait to see it again... and again... then buy it on BluRay. =D",1384214400,3,1949,4.47887323943662
6085611,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

I was a little surprised that I was quite fond of the original ""Thor"" from 2011.  Like that movie, the scenes created here for the various non-Earth worlds have some spectacular CGI effects.  And like that movie, the most interesting events are on Earth.  This story picks up after ""The Avengers"" but makes references back to Asgard, Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) home planet.

Thousands of years earlier, Thor's granddaddy defeated an evil empire (Dark Elves) that was built on destruction of all the planets, er... realms.  The Elves leader at the time, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and a few of his top lieutenants, survived but were put in a state of deep sleep.

A key ingredient to creating undefeatable power is a wispy red vapor known as the Aether.  Skip ahead a few millennial back to planet Earth.  Thor's human girlfriend, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) hasn't seen the hunky dude for 2 years as he's trying to bring and everlasting peace to the 9 realms.  Jane and her sidekicks Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Ian (Jonathan Howard) get a tip on an unusual phenomenon at an abandon warehouse.  It turns out, it's the Aether.  How coincidental.

So as Thor is bringing a lasting peace, Jane unleashes the Aether which sends a signal of sort to the sleeping Malekith and here we go again.  It's hard enough to keep up with all the various realms, characters and places as it is, so I don't usually get too critical of plot disconnects.  Still I couldn't understand how the father of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) could wipe out the Dark Elves thousands of years earlier, yet when revived, the small group, even without the Aether, seemed to be able to kick Asgardian ass.  Wouldn't Asgard have developed better weapons and defenses during all those centuries?

Ultimately the film looks great.  Hemsworth and Portman have a nice chemistry between them even if they never really hook up beyond a few smooches.  Hopkins' Odin is appropriately regal with his gold eye patch and neatly trimmed white beard.  Rene Russo as Thor's mom, Frigga gets a couple nice scenes including cool sword fighting.  Ultimately, the best thing here is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, the bad-boy adopted brother of Thor.  Sentence to life in prison, Loki is released by Thor on the promise that he would help fight Malekith.  He's fun to watch and gets some good lines.  ""The Dark World"" is fine entertainment almost up to the measure of the original.  For some viewers it will seem like more of the same, for others that's exactly what they want.",1384214400,,2565,4.839080459770115
6085612,4,B00GLPCKX8,"I thought Thor 2 the Dark World was really good. I think its very sad that Kenneth Branagh didn't return to direct or Patrick Doyle to compose. I think it would been an amazing series of films if they would of stayed on board. I do believe Alan Taylor did a good job of letting people know he wasn't going to take a dump on the world that Kenneth B. established. I like the direction he went but it was at the same time what has been hurting Marvel films. I think with their continued overuse of comedy it is truly hurting their films. I mean you get a touching or sad moment or a great fight and than a pointless humor scene for no reason. I think they really need to lose all the humor or they will begin to lose the hardcore comic readers. I truly hope they get rid of the over use of comedy in these films it truly is getting old.

Script-I give the script a C because of the over use of comedy and how the villain died *Spoiler Alert*(really a ship kills a guy that was all powerful and some dumb rods that make things disappear... OK! lmao) but the action sequences were great.

Actors-I thought every actor that they brought in did a great job. I think the only part that kinda bothered me was Joshua Dallas no longer being Fandral. The new actor does look the part though and doesnt do too bad of a job.

Musical Score-The musical score was absolutely awful. I give it an F. It was by far nothing but blaring nonsense that had no emotion that Patrick Doyle's previous theme had

Action-I give the action an A+. I think the action really saved this film for me and I think they are some of the very best I have ever seen. They aren't a super A+ like Man of Steel had but they were still great. Man of Steel had in my opinion some of the greatest fight scenes of all time.

Story Locations-I think Asgard looked great as I remember from that great Kenneth B film and I loved seeing other realms like the Dark Elves world and hinting at Surtur's fiery realm!",1384214400,,1963,4.182539682539683
6085613,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Here's yet another movie from Marvel Studios--Thor: The Dark World. The trailers looked like typical blockbuster adventure trailers, but they did promise a big fantasy in worlds far from our own. I tempered my expectations, though, after being disappointed with Iron Man 3. I must admit that I'm somewhat of a sucker for big fantasy adventures. I was hoping that this would indeed be better than Iron Man 3.

If you're expecting spectacular imagery and intense action, you'll find it here. If you're expecting plenty of funny gags, you'll find those here too. Tom Hiddleston steals his scenes as Loki, but all the other actors are effective too. The whole thing is a pretty wild science fiction high fantasy mash-up, especially with the somewhat convoluted, but still fairly coherent, plot. I really don't have much else to say, as what you see is what you get and the movie is indeed typical.",1384128000,2,893,4.875
6085614,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The plot of ""Thor: The Dark World"" centers on an ominous cosmic singularity that puts the known realms, including earth, at risk, thanks to some evil elves left over from the darkness at the beginning of time. Remember to pay attention during the introduction, or the movie will be hard to follow.

The story picks up where the ""Thor"" and ""Avenger"" movies left it, with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in Asgard missing his mortal girl, his mischief-making brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) confined to a dungeon, and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) on earth and about to stumble into a dark and evil substance called aether. Jane's encounter will raise the dark elves from their long slumber, trigger an horrendous invasion of Asgard, and force tough choices on Thor, including having to defy his father and to trust Loki...

The special effects are terrific. Asgard is visually stunning as the abode of the Norse gods. The sinister ship of the dark elves looks realistic in space and in London. The fight scenes with the dark elves are thrilling.  The dialogue is quite good.  Janes friends (Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard) provide some welcome comic relief). The plot moves along smartly, with many moments of suspense and misdirection, lightened by some wonderful sight gags.

""Thor: The Dark World"" is good entertainment, especially for those familiar with the Marvel universe of superheroes, and recommended.  Stay through the credits of a hint on the next movie.",1384128000,,1458,5.054166666666666
6085615,5,B00GLPCKX8,"""Thor: Dark World"" is another addition to the on-going series of Marvel superhero movies that have displayed an uncanny knack for longevity and success. There seems to be no end to the public's desire for individual superhero movies as well as gathering them all together for ""Avengers"" movies. ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron"" is slated to release in 2015. This has been cause for some criticism as some of the individual movies are more tie-in than stand alone films.

I'm the first to admit that many of these Marvel movies appear to me to be more money-making ventures than exercises in good film-making. Sure, all movies are money-making ventures, but some of these films were hampered by lazy scripts and events that are just there to string you along to the next movie or to sit through long stretches of movie with sparse action, watching talking heads or even montages of events.

""Thor"" was the movie I was least excited about, having been an Iron Man fan growing up, but it was ""Thor"" that I actually ended up enjoying the most out of all the films. It wasn't lazy film-making, it had a good script, they didn't sell the viewer short with a superhero incapacitated or give you an hour of film where the only action is a superhero shooting fruit while drunk. Most importantly, they had a story to tell that engrossed the entire film.

""Thor: The Dark World"", for lack of better words, makes all of the other Marvel films, with the exception of ""Avengers"", look like they were made by amateurs with good equipment. Just as I was growing tired of superhero films (and I'm a huge fan), ""Thor: The Dark World"" shattered all of that. It is quite simply the most complete action/adventure film I have seen in years. Not only did the movie have a good story to tell, it was loaded with charm and skillful creativity from top to bottom.

You want films to take you there and not remind you that you went somewhere until its over and ""Thor: The Dark World"" did that on all levels. I haven't sat through a film with such joy and involvement and forgotten my critical eye since I was a teenager. It was an effects and visual marvel and never once did I think they were trying to cheap out the viewer with a lazy script. ""Thor: The Dark World"" let it all hang out and in the process, they may have created one of the most complete and entertaining films in decades. It was funny, frightening, exciting, intelligent, intriguing and a movie not to be missed, even if you aren't a follower of the Marvel series.",1384128000,5,2503,4.5432372505543235
6085616,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Marvel is re-creating what they did to create The Avengers, right now, with their Infinity Stones sub-plot. It's just introducing a piece at a time as they build up to something bigger. In The Avengers, we got our first view of Thanos and his attempt to take control of the Tesseract, which, in The Dark World, is revealed to be one of the six Infinity Stones, artifacts predating the origins of the universe. And, also on The Dark World, Malekith is after the Aether which is another of these ""stones"" although it actually takes on a fluid form.

This all sounds like it's leading up to an Infinity Gauntlet kind of scenario, which would be pretty darn cool and pretty darn cosmic. The fact that Guardians of the Galaxy is coming out next year only strengthens the case for all of this. I would expect another of the Infinity Stones to show up in that one.

Of course, none of that actually relates to whether Thor: The Dark World is any good in and of itself.

Actually, Thor 2 is better than Thor. This one just seemed more ""Thor"" than the first one, although I don't have a good reason for feeling that way because there was an awful lot of Thor-ness about the first one, too. Maybe, it was just that this one flowed more smoothly whereas the first one definitely seemed to have its ""Earth"" parts and its ""Asgard"" parts as separate things. If you're doing Thor as Thor (not Thor trapped in the body of a mortal), he definitely needs to have the full range of being Thor.

And there were a lot of cool moves with Mjolnir in this one, things like Thor leaping off of balconies as the hammer came whizzing over the building and into his hand. They definitely did their best to show the connection between Thor and the hammer.

The acting was great, even Christopher Eccleston, whom I'm not particularly fond of as an actor (Doctor or not). His range seems to be quite small, but his role as Malekith was a good fit as it didn't require a lot of emotion and even less facial expression. Zachary Levi also did a pretty good job as Fandral, although, as partial as I am to Chuck, I think he didn't quite fill out Josh Dallas' shoes. There was just some ineffable quality about Dallas that made him more Fandral. Portman, also, seemed to wear the role of Jane Foster much more easily in this one, so that was nice.

The thing that really made the movie work, though, was the chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Even when not onscreen together, they pulled off the roles of warring brothers perfectly. The sibling rivalry was perfect. There's this one moment where Thor is about to hit Loki (hey, it's not really a spoiler, okay (well, kind of, but, well, deal with it)) and Thor pulls away saying, ""Mother wouldn't want us to fight,"" and Loki smiles and says, ""But she wouldn't be shocked."" The relationship is perfect.

The movie also has a bit more humor in it than the last Thor, and it's not all at the expense of Darcy this time, though she does have her moments. The only real negative I'd say the movie has is that the humor breaks the tension a little too much every so often. But those are only minor bumps on the road and barely memorable once past them. It does pull you right back in.

Overall, the movie has an epic feel to it that seems appropriate to a story about gods, and it does it while keeping the movie personal. That all by itself is quite an accomplishment. So, yeah, I think Thor 2 is a step above the first one, something that's not all  that common with a sequel. It doesn't make it up to the level of the first Iron Man or Captain America movies, but it does surpass both of the Iron Man sequels. If you've been following the Marvel movies at all, you certainly don't want to miss this one.",1384041600,5,3723,4.399709302325581

6085618,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) leader of the Dark Elves attacks Asgard in search of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) when she becomes infected with a powerful weapon. Thor searches for a way to save Jane, while wanting vengeance on Malekith. Vengeance brings Loki and Thor together as well, for reasons I won't get into.
  Thor 2 is unfortunately an uneven action comedy. That's right, I said comedy. Throughout the film it takes itself serious one minute and throws humor at us the next. It's as if they think every Marvel film now should balance humor and action, Avengers style. Which sadly made the movie pretty goofy. And reminded me of a disappointing film...like Episode 1, since I sat for awhile kind of bored waiting for it to become what I was hoping for.
  We have seen super villains who just want to blow *beep* up in the past. So yeah, Malekith is nothing fresh. And looks like a combination of something from Lord of the Rings and Star Trek Nemesis. Plus, we've seen enough cities destroyed in Transformers, the Avengers and Man of Steel to not be too impressed any more by cgi carnage.
  I also have to add the Thor and Jane Foster romance has always felt forced to me. All their scenes together add up to nothing in the end. Thor and Loki together again is what's fun. Kat Dennings (2 Broke Girls) is the most interesting woman in the film as Foster's intern, now with her...own intern. She reacts better to all the craziness around her then probably anyone else in the movie. Even a woman in a subway acts like it's normal when Thor walks in. Stellan Skarsgard is also fun reprising his genius scientist role but this time he has gone mad due to Loki's mind control.
  I liked enough of the movie to recommend it but I think Kenneth Branagh made the Thor universe much more interesting. With this director it kind of just trudged along, jumping from one scene to another. Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 are unfortunately just an ""Eh"" start to Marvel phase 2. Hopefully Captain America 2 is better.",1384041600,10,2005,4.581005586592179
6085619,4,B00GLPCKX8,"It's not that ""Thor: The Dark World"" is any less extravagant than ""Thor"" since you still spend a fair amount of time in Asgard and it's still just as impressive as it was in the first film, but ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a darker film in comparison. This seems like an obvious statement since the enemy of the film is Malekith and his Dark Elves while Aether is a form of dark energy, but the visuals in the film are extremely dark. The time spent in Svartalfeim can contribute to this since the realm is volcanic and ashy. However the entire film seems to purposely be coated in this dark filter and isn't nearly as bright and vibrant as ""Thor"" is.

Depending on how you felt about the cast the first time around, the superhero sequel is unlikely to waiver your opinion one way or another. Tom Hiddleston aims for the moon with his performance and doesn't disappoint. Loki is a powerhouse in ""Thor: The Dark World."" With his unpredictable nature and ceaseless trickery, Loki is a character that everyone seems to love and for good reason. His commentary is worth the price of admission alone. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is fantastic as Kurse, but it's mostly due to how superb his costume and prosthetics are. Tadanobu Asano gets even less screen time than he did in the first film and Christopher Eccleston is solid as Malekith, but it's the way the character is written that's disappointing. At the end of the day, looking past all the bells and whistles of the Aether, Malekith is basically a pushover. Bringing back Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga is also a confusing addition, especially with how her story arc plays out. Aside from a couple really enjoyable cameos in the film, the appearance of Chris O'Dowd was quite a pleasant surprise especially if you're a fan of ""The IT Crowd.""

It's intriguing to consider that ""Thor: The Dark World"" has a slightly higher budget than its predecessor since the original film is so much flashier in comparison. The Dark Elves, Kurse, the spaceship battles, and the Aether must have cost a pretty penny. The Aether is constantly moving, flows like a liquid, and is red in appearance. So when it takes over Jane's body and she starts having visions about how this red river inside her is going to destroy the universe, you can't help but choke back jokes about Jane's monthly visitor. Next to their impressive space crafts, The Dark Elves have alien weaponry like spears that shoot lasers and black hole grenades that are extremely fun to watch in action.

""Thor: The Dark World"" feels like a different film than ""Thor."" There's this somber atmosphere in the sequel that seems to always hint at impending doom. While Malekith seems to be threatening the existence of everything, he's dealt with so easily. Thor is torn between restoring order to the nine realms, the love of his life, and taking over his father's throne. So why does so much time seem to be given to Kat Dennings, her intern, and Stellan Skarsgard running around naked in Stonehenge?

""Thor: The Dark World"" is visually enticing, but in a more ominous way than in the first film. With extraordinary special effects and an inclusive story, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is sure to be well-liked by those who loved the first film and a must-see for any fan of the Marvel Studios films but fails to be as exhilarating and as well done as ""Thor.""",1384041600,4,3347,4.67741935483871
6085620,2,B00GLPCKX8,"Just saw this piece of Low Brow Super Hero Crap, and if you have any intelligence whatsoever, STAY AWAY!  This film is for 12-22 year olds, who just want to see stuff go 'Boom' . The story and/or Plot is nonexistent, it feels completely put together by Committee ( I just read it had 5 writers!), and it felt like they didn't edit out any of their storylines! This movie jumps all over the place, with bad editing, bad dialogue, moderate CGI, and no Charachter development whatsoever. In fact, it's obvious in several scenes with Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston, that they manipulated Chris Hemsworths voice to lower it and make him sound more Shakesperian. It just sounds like he has a head cold, so sad and desperate. Poor Chris just comes off as a Lifeguard in a Super Hero Outfit. (Is he destined to be the new Brad Pitt?).

Its also annoying that we had to sit through a full trailer for 'Captain America', AFTER the movie started! And then have
numerous idiotic references to S.H.I.E.L.D, which leads me to believe the 2 assistants are going to appear on the TV show soon. (Its just one more Example of Pointless interruptions in Story & Logic.) the 'humour' is LAME and unnecessary, and the 'Chick Flick' feel every time Natalie Portman enters a scene is soooooo annoying. This Film has the Worst Case of 'Identity Crisis' I've ever seen!

This movie will appeal to the lower of the Common Denominators, but if Marvel really intends to have a future as a Studio with Disney, they need to commit to a good script before the first day of shooting. PS: Loki is the ONLY saving grace in this film. Marvel needs to give him his own film soon, or Risk losing a huge portion of their audience. Just because we're over 25 doesn't mean our voices don't count (Even over the sound of Cold Hard Cash), which won't last forever! History has shown, if you are only coveting the younger audience, you will eventually Lose, as they BORE faster than any other segment of the population.

6085621,5,B00GLPCKX8,"This movie has the action and excitement of Star Wars and the epic grand scale of it, too. The movie is both humorous but also serious drama. It has a few points I could knit-pick but all in all it is a fun, thrilling ride, filled with little Norse myth references, amazing costumes and great performances by the whole cast. I wish Malekith had more screen time, so I hope there is a director's cut or at least lots of deleted scenes. I heard much of his stuff ended up on the cutting room floor. I've already seen this movie twice. The 3D isn't so amazing that it loses much in 2D however, it sounded so much better in the state-of-the-art digital Dolby surround at the theater where I'd seen the 3D version. The music is wonderful, too! I being Team Loki especially loved the piece called ""Lokasenna"" which plays eerily throughout the film and during end credits. Now I can't wait for Thor 3!",1383955200,3,894,4.424242424242424
6085622,4,B00GLPCKX8,"As part of their ever-expanding and ambitious film series, Marvel Studios brings us ""Thor: The Dark World"", the second film in Phase Two of Marvel's Cinematic Universe and the third overall to feature the God of Thunder. With a new director at the helm, and showcasing the typical humor and action that fans of the studio have come to expect, ""Thor: The Dark World"" proves it's a worthy and enjoyable addition to the Marvel universe.

The story finds our hero fighting to restore order in the aftermath of ""Thor"" and ""Marvel's The Avengers"", as chaos and rebellions have erupted throughout the Nine Realms. As battles are fought and uprisings are quenched, an ancient race known as the Dark Elves awakens to seek vengeance on Asgard and destroy the universe. Faced with an unknown enemy and a weapon that seemingly can't be destroyed, Thor desperately seeks out the help of the traitor Loki in hopes to restore order to the cosmos.

In his third outing as the title character, it's clear that Chris Hemsworth is more than comfortable in playing the mighty hero, delivering witty one-liners and bone-crunching punches with ease. His acting chops have increased since he first picked up the hammer, which is a good thing because this sequel gives him a lot more to work with, both emotionally and physically. His relationships with Loki (played brilliantly, once again, by Tom Hiddleston) and Jane Foster (the lovely Natalie Portman) are explored quite a bit here, which is a good thing considering the great chemistry between a cast chalk-full of returning actors. Along with a great cast, another element the film has going for it is director Alan Taylor, of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" fame, who accomplishes the difficult task of balancing the fantasy elements of the film with a good character-driven story. There's no doubt his work on GoT helped punch up the battle scenes in the film, especially the large-scale ones.

There's a lot of fun to be had in this sequel, more so, in my opinion, than the origin story that proceeds it. Although the first half is a bit slow to introduce the stakes and backstory of the movie, the film really finds itself at the halfway point by exploring the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki. Overall the sequel contains a lot of fun moments, high-stakes action sequences, a terrific cast, and strong direction, making the film a thoroughly enjoyable one.",1383955200,3,2399,4.903940886699507
6085623,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I never buy blu-rays but I just realized I have to buy this one because Tom Hiddleston is doing commentary :( Damn you, marketing ploy for working like a charm!!",1383955200,2,161,4.4
6085624,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I've been looking forward to the second installment in Thor's story ever since I saw the first back in 2011--but at the same time, I've had some concerns. What I loved most about the first movie--Thor's fish-out-of-water experiences during his exile on earth--would have to be absent this time around. After all, Thor's spent considerable time on earth by now (okay, so it was spent in battle with the other five Avengers in what has come to be known in the Marvel universe as The Battle of New York).

As it turns out, however, the God of Thunder still has a lot to learn about this planet. Though Thor: The Dark World is decidedly darker than the first movie, it still manages to deliver enough in the humor department, mostly thanks to the big guy himself (Chris Hemsworth, who I suspect was created in a lab somewhere just for this role) and his wayward adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who's made being a bad guy a good thing).

Most of the usual suspects are back: Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, who's been waiting not-so-patiently for two years for Thor to return; Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Erik Selvig, damaged by Loki's possession in The Avengers, is behaving erratically (running around naked at Stonehenge in front of TV cameras is pretty erratic, don't you think?) and toting a huge bag full of prescription drugs...Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who finds a little romance in the middle of chaos...Odin (Anthony Hopkins), who, let's face it, is never going to be named Father of the Year...Frigga (Rene Russo), the only person in the Nine Realms who Loki actually loves (who do you think taught Loki that bag of tricks?)...Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and the Warriors Three (Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Zachary Levi, replacing Joshua Dallas as Fandral)--all committing treason with Thor and Loki in order to save Asgard and avenge Frigga's death--the result of an invasion of Asgard by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his Dark Elves, searching for the substance that can restore the universe to total darkness.

Thor knows he can't trust Loki, but also knows this is a war he can't win without his brother. ""Trust my rage,"" Loki suggests.

The best dialogue in the movie is, without a doubt, between Thor and Loki. The visuals are stunning--Asgard is even more beautiful than I remember it from the first Thor (Asgardian funerals are resplendent, and their prisons are downright classy), and the action is intense, as the battle rages on throughout the Nine Realms via portals similar to the one in which the Chitauri invaded New York in The Avengers.

As with the first movie, my favorite moments involve humor--Thor hanging his mythical hammer, Mjolnir, on a coat rack; trying to take the subway to Greenwich; squeezing into Jane's small vehicle (I'm still trying to picture Chris Hemsworth in a Formula One racer in Rush!); Stan Lee's cameo in a mental hospital; and the end credits scene involving something from Jotunheim that came to Earth through an open portal and remains in London. I would love to see Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his Agents of SHIELD be summoned to deal with it!

I'm going to have to disagree with the reviewers who refer to Thor as ""a meathead."" An intelligent person is smart enough to know he doesn't have all the answers and seeks out those who do; a meathead is too dumb to know he's dumb. Thor is far from stupid.

The movie's ending leaves a few important unanswered questions, and the first of the two end-credits scenes offers a foreshadowing of things to come. Thanos, anyone?

My only disappointment: not enough romance. Thor's a pretty hot guy with two women, Jane and Sif, clearly in love with him...yet he doesn't seem to have done the horizontal samba with either of them. I realize this is Disney, where the only place you can find sex is in a dictionary, but come on! You don't have to be graphic--just fade to black as movies used to do! A guy cannot possibly look like Thor and still be a virgin! He had one shirtless scene in the whole movie, and he was alone. Now that really stretches credibility to its limits.

I'll bet Loki's been in more than a few ladies' chambers....",1383955200,11,4172,4.767313019390581
6085625,5,B00GLPCKX8,"The first Thor was a problematic film for me. I loved the actors, I loved the Jack-Kirby-perfect Asgard, but the film itself felt flat. Perhaps it was the rather disorganized plot, perhaps it was the way it followed the same strategy as films like Time Guardian and Galaxia, beginning in lush sci-fi locales but migrating to a small town to save money later on. Avengers further attached me to Hemsworth's Thor, and so I was really looking forward to seeing him get a grander, more developed outing. Thor: the Dark World does not disappoint.

Once again, the source of troubles is another race of ancient magic aliens, this time the Dark Elves led by their king Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, still failing to buck that Doctor Who typecasting). The Dark Elves (who are more or less the Eldar from Warhammer 40,000 for all intents and purposes) are the longtime enemies of the Asgardians, but after an apocolyptic battle only a handful of them remain. Awakened by the coming alignment of all the worlds connected by Yggdrasil (they hyperspace network that connects all the worlds Thor and his pals hang out on) Malekith and his creepily masked flunkies set out to recover the Ether, a spooky living weapon that will blot out all light in the universe.

Predictably conflict ensues. Through a series of accidents the Ether winds up living inside Thor's human sweetheart, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where it will grow until it devours her. Defying Odin, Thor hatches a surprisingly cunning plan to dupe Malekith into removing the Ether from Foster so he can destroy the Elven leader and his weapon in one go. Things don't go so swimmingly, and it all comes down to a ludicrously silly, magnificently well-done battle across dimensions for the fate of the universe (with a tube ride through London in the middle).

If, like me, you loved everything about Thor but just wanted it to be better, then this is the film for you. Thor and Foster's romance, forced and simplistic in the first movie, is played out well here. Asgard, before just a shiny setpiece, is now a well-built series of believable locations with an aged, lived-in feel to them. The Dark Elves, unlike the thuggish Frost Giants, have a technology and martial prowess that seems genuinely threatening. Baddie Eccleston does a decent enough job, although he lacks some of his scenery chewing prowess that we've seen in films like G.I. Joe and 28 Days Later. Even Foster's intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) is a tolerable comic presence this time around. And of course we get more Stellan Skarsgrd, who is always fabulous.

Real credit is due, however, to Tom Hiddleston as Loki. I felt sure that after two films as the big bad I'd be sick of him, but his turn as Thor's crafty, somewhat unwilling accomplice is meaty and exciting. You genuinely can't tell how much of his behavior is sincere and how much of it is buildup to some treachery- without giving too much away, even though Loki is on Thor's side in this film, he is by far a more dangerous force than Malekith. Just wait for it.

Of course there are also some little tidbits thrown in at the end of the film to foreshadow future installments, which are now all but guaranteed to echo the Infinity Gauntlet storyline (as if seeing Thanos in Avengers wasn't a big enough clue). What this means for the next Avengers and other Marvel properties is anyone's guess, but color me excited as all get out.

I can think of very few bad things to say about this film to counterbalance the good. Sif and the Warriors Three are still rather underused (but then Thor already has another super team) and Idris Elba's Heimdall is still solidly a supporting character (although he does fight a spaceship using parkour and stabbing, so that's pretty cool). There are also some effects that seem a little odd- a thrown boulder near the middle looks a little wobbly-fake, and in the climax Malekith grows to enormous proportions which is not really made clear until he starts fighting Thor. By and large, though, this is a very very good film, and the acting, writing and visuals are nearly above reproach.

Pros:
-Exactly like the first Thor only better
-Boasts a big sense of scale and tension
-Skilled cast elevates it above just a comic book movie

Cons:
-A few wonky effects here and there
-Lacks the memorable, bombastic theme music we've seen in other Marvel films",1383955200,8,4370,4.755936675461742
6085626,3,B00GLPCKX8,"The quality of the first ""Thor"" entry is often a point of contention among a good deal of people and myself. Personally, I found Branagh's film to be energetic and lively, with a fantastic cast bolstered by solid direction and an entertainingly cheesy plot. Many people don't share that viewpoint in the slightest, I came to find out. Regardless, that didn't damper my excitement for the follow-up, which has a different director but the same writers. It's a shame, then, that after seeing this on opening night, the first phrase that came out of my mouth was, ""Well, that kind of sucked."" Because despite all of its best efforts, ""Thor: The Dark World"" suffers from a sophomore slump that undercuts any of the film's strong points.

After the events of ""The Avengers,"" Thor has been patrolling the nine realms in an attempt to keep interdimensional peace. Loki has been locked in away in a cell, and Jane Foster has been... well, apparently trying to step up her dating game, despite still pining for her pretty-boy Asgardian prince. But all of this is threatened by the introduction of the Dark Elves, an ancient race of warriors whom Odin presumed to be dead after he ravaged their world with the restraint of a crazed elephant. In a predictable twist, the Dark Elves invade Asgard, kill a lot of people, and severely anger Thor and Loki to the point where they end up working together. Also, Jane gets possessed by some ancient parasitic weapon, the laws of physics start failing in London, and the Earth is on the verge of getting destroyed.

As you can probably tell from my less than excited tone about the plot, this movie's narrative is a complete snore-fest when held in comparison to the first one. The writers have simply tried to tackle way too much in way too short of a running time, which results in a film that feels simultaneously plodding and rushed. Casualties of this flawed narrative include entire subplots that get introduced, then dropped with no abandon. We're supposed to be led that there's an elaborate love triangle, that Loki has some sinister plan being carefully plotted out, that physics going berserk is because of a certain reason. But when the credits begin to roll, it feels like we've only seen about 1/4 of the story. Altogether, this film feels incredibly unfocused and incomplete, and for the second time in the Marvel Universe films (the first being the ""Captain America""), it felt like I was watching a two hour trailer for the next ""Avengers"" film.

The other problem with this film is the absolutely unbelievable love story. Despite both being great actors in their own right, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman simply have no chemistry together as the lovers from other worlds. When they kiss, it feels forced, and their ""romantic"" dialogue made me feel as if I was being forcefed sugar from a funnel. It's almost unbearable to watch them interact at times, which is a bit saddening when their chemistry in the first film was pretty convincing.

At least the acting and fighting keep things moving along. Tom Hiddleston is especially wonderful as Loki, finally showing a commitment to the role that I quite frankly didn't know he had. The energy between him and Hemsworth is dynamic, and honestly, it feels like they have more chemistry together than Portman and Hemsworth. Other actors, including Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins, are also top-notch here, and the inclusion of reliable Chris O'Dowd is also welcome. Aside from the acting, we have some pretty entertaining fights bolstered by lavish special effects, the best of which is the admittedly enthralling final brawl in London. What undercuts this, however, is when the film tries to be a low-rent ""Star Wars"" and implement downright stupid aircraft battles in Asgard, complete with faceless warriors carrying lasers, laser-blasting cannons, and laser turrets. Oh, and the main villain can essentially use the Force. I wish I was making this stuff up, but I'm not. It was if the writers didn't know what genre movie was, and artificially tried to appeal to as many demographics as possible.

The result of this is a film that falls flat on its face harder than Thor's Mjolnir. Some parts of this movie are genuinely entertaining and fun, but not enough to merit the ticket price, and certainly not enough to merit owning it on home video. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is not an awful movie, but simply a very dull one, one that is nowhere nearly as engaging and fun as its predecessor. With a rushed plot, forced romance, and an ending that feels like a cheap ripoff, there are a lot better things you could spend your money on going to see this month.

Overall: C",1383955200,9,4664,4.809226932668329
6085627,5,B00GLPCKX8,"*This review contains only minor spoilers - merely a short recap of the film's beginning to establish context.

Thor and Asgard offer Marvel it's biggest cinematic challenge (likely until Guardians of the Galaxy) in terms of story and characters. It's a mystical world filled aliens, realms, and strange beasts. It's a difficult process to establish the story, and Thor: The Dark World begins like Thor did, begins with a detailed story narrated by Odin (Anthony Hopkins). It establishes our villain, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his motivations. It establishes the plot device - MacGuffin - in the Aether, a powerful fluid that can cast complete darkness across whatever it touches. It's in fact more complicated than that, but the setting is placed.

As for our remaining cast, the story takes places immediately after the events in The Avengers. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is marched in chains to stand before Odin for judgement. Loki's hate for Odin is as strong as ever, although his love for his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is still strong. Thor on the other hand is busy fixing Loki's mess across the realms. Eventually, we'll see that Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is discovering strange events related to The Convergence, an aligning of the nine realms. This is how Jane and Thor's lives will overlap.

I only detail the story this far as an example of how complicated the story is to setup the remaining events of the film. It's not too complicated that you get lost, but it demonstrates that Marvel has a daunting task with the mystical elements of their cinematic universe. It's a task that they and director Alan Taylor (a few Game of Thrones episodes) handle extremely well. Taylor steers us through an expanded look at the realms, the depths of Asgard and the technologies of the Dark Elves (Malekith and his army). It's also an appropriately dark film, thematically. Lots of people die, there's limb severing, stabbing, slaying and plenty of war battles. Despite that, Marvel never loses it's way and ensures that the writers and Taylor balance that with easily the funniest scenes from any Marvel movie to date.*

Malekith is a real threat to Asgard and all of the realms. He isn't easily beaten, his army is supernaturally strong and determined. He and his minions beat Thor and Asgardian troops into submission plenty of times. If there's any complaint with his character is that he's given less screen time than he deserves. His ever-present threat is what drives the film primarily.

Chris Hemsworth continues his good performances as Thor, but as usual, Tom Hiddleston steals the film as Loki. It's clear that Hiddleston loves this role and he pours everything he's got into it. Thankfully, more time is given to just Loki and Thor together and they're some of the best scenes of the movie. Hopkins is in ultra-enunciation mode, but it works just fine to establish his role as king. Rene Russo is a real surprise and treat as her role is expanded to give a glimpse of why she's queen and that she can just as easily stand at the ranks of the warriors in her family. Natalie Portman gives a nice performance as well as a few wonderful scenes with Stellan Skarsgrd.

Visually, Thor: The Dark World is beautiful. The graphics are impressive, but the sets are just as intricate as Thor, so it's a world that feels real and authentic. Lots of care is given to make the world and story stand on their own and not feel like the strange, mythical world that awkwardly fits into the Earth-centric stories of Captain America and Iron Man. It's a fun, hilarious and yet serious film that moves all of our characters forward on their ultimate journey leading to The Avengers: Age of Ultron and beyond.

*[ A scene between Loki and Thor walking together will go down as many people's favorite in the movie, and possibly their favorite scene to date in this Marvel universe.]",1383955200,9,3885,4.833082706766917
6085628,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Saying Thor: The Dark World was good is an understatement. I won't bore you with a summary as I'm sure most of you as readers know what the movie is about. What I will say is that the plot was solid, the drive and motivation for the action that was taken was well executed, and this movie does Thor REAL Justice. I liked the first one for what it is, but this time around you got to see more of Asgard as a people and culture and there is more back story between it's relationship and the other 9 realms including Midgard (Earth). The relationship between Thor and his brother Loki was really developed and as viewers we get to see what tough choices has to be made for the greater good. Thor 2 was filled with ALOT of action. The characters and all the actors that played them were executed flawlessly and as far as where this is rated among other Marvel movies, I'd say it is the best solo movie since the first Iron Man. It was a wild ride that gave you very nice twists, action, humor, tragedy, and finishes with a very nice cliff hanger. I won't spoil you'll have to see for yourself ;).

I give it a 9/10. Would have given it a 9.5 but the second post credit scene was lacking a lot! Served no real purpose but for romantic closure.",1383955200,3,1238,4.201680672268908
6085629,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Personally, I agree with all the positive comments lauded upon this production.

The main problem that I see for Thor is...""Where does he go next?""

I wish those in charge of bringing Thor's story to the screen...""Good Luck""

I rate ""Thor: The Dark World""...Four stars! (Mjolnir, his enchanted hammer...gets 10 stars!  That magical mallet is unlike any weapon I have ever seen...and, to be clear - what we have seen is NOTHING compared to what it is truly capable of...anybody out there remember the story of RAGNAROK (in Thor: Issue 200/1972) - or the INDESTRUCABLE?

6085630,5,B00GLPCKX8,"I really didn't know what to expect with Thor: The Dark World. I loved the first film to pieces and really thought it couldn't get better than that.

Well, it did.

It completely surpassed my expectations and was probably the most fun I've had watching a Marvel movie since The Avengers; and even though I really liked Iron Man 3, Thor was easily the better movie of the two. The cast is once again fantastic, but I'm going to single out Tom Hiddleston in particular. God, he's just so perfect for Loki. He gives him the perfect balance.: Not too jovial, yet not the Ultimate Master of Evil either. I see Loki as the 10-year-old in a man's body kind of thing and Hiddleston pulls it off extremely well.

There's a little more humor weaved into the story this time, which can be both great and a drag at the same time. I felt like the quips in the first half of the film were well-placed and entertaining, but during the second half, it felt like humor was just thrown in there to be funny, though I will admit that I thought all scenes with Stellan Skarsgard were fantastic.

The pacing is a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, I thought it was a pretty well-paced movie. The beginning is a little slow, but quickly picks up, so the viewer won't really have time to be bored. Another thing that I really appreciated was the fact that the writers were able to stay focused on the main plot. That was one *huge* problem with Iron Man 3 that I failed to realize until I was watching The Dark World in the theater earlier today. As  much as I love Shane Black's work; Drew Pearce should've stopped him and told him to slow down a little. The characters don't need to be doing 75 different things at one time. People won't be bored by them just doing a couple things at once, it makes the story flow so much better.

As mentioned, the cast is great and all seem to have great chemistry with each other. The only new character that bugged me was Darcy's intern.

So, if you enjoyed the first film, see this for sure. Some may not enjoy that there's more humor, but the overall pace and dedication to the plot makes up for the cheesy humor in the second half. It's fun, entertaining and a great way to spend 2 hours of your day!",1383955200,6,2214,4.294964028776978

6085632,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Intrigue and revenge are two of the multiple themes that are displayed in Thor: The Dark World.  Both Thor and his father Odin are faced with a powerful but evil leader named Malekeith bent on inflicting suffering. This leader's taste for violent chaos comes from personal tragedy in his own life.  I enjoyed the love story that played out between the characters of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). This is because both characters seamlessly picked up where they last left off from the first film with their relationship.  Additionally, Thor's character is shown bravely taking Jane Foster to his world despite how his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) may act. Realistically, true emotion was also shown when Thor and his brother Loki are greatly affected by an event that would change many people (involving a family member).  Idris Elba is given an even bigger influential role in the plot of the film as Heimdall.  Heimdall's character portrays a sense of perceptiveness in a scene that involves him foreseeing what can happen on one of the main bridges in Asgard. Just a gentle suggestion: maybe Heimdall could be including with Thor in future films as some type of advisor to both Thor and/or his father Odin regarding protection plans for Asgard and/or other strategic mission ideas. My husband's favorite character portrayals were that of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). This is because Loki's character is portayed as a strong spirit who wisely knows how to appeal to Thor's heart-centered side while also shrewdly concealing his private and tricky plans. Eccleston's Malekith also appealed to my husband due to the character depth portrayal of what motivated Malekith's actions.  Thor: The Dark World is great for those who enjoyed the first film or those who like fantasy films with the inclusion of these other actors/actresses: Stellan Skarsgard, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Chris O' Dowd,Kat Dennings, Ray Stevenson, Zachary Levi, Tadanobu Asano, Jaimie Alexander, and Rene Russo.",1383955200,5,2041,5.264615384615385
6085633,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Saw this tonight. Loved it. This is a wild, wild movie with standout action sequences to spare, especially involving Thor, Loki and Mjlonir hehe.  The film's not short on drama either although I wish we could have gotten a little more out of the budding Sif/Thor/Jane triangle. There's also some real heart-felt tragedy and a nice cliffhanger ending but I won't spoil anything.  Good stuff.  Real good stuff.",1383868800,5,408,4.970588235294118
6085634,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The Avengers have taken the movie world by storm; but aside from Iron Man, if there has been any character that has made big impression on silver screen, it would be The God of Thunder: Thor. Whether you enjoy the interpretation, or just like Tom Hiddleston's Loki, the fact is that Thor has become a must see hero on screen. The character's journey began in the summer of 2011 and now the Thunderer's adventures continues in Thor: The Dark World. Directed by Alan Taylor, The Dark World brings Marvel's Phase 2 to the Holiday Season;which is a new step for the studio. Business standpoints aside, is the next chapter of Thor worthy of not just the The Mighty Avenger, but Marvel Studios?

The Dark World continues the tale of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Since the destruction of Bifrost, The God of Thunder has been restoring order to the nine realms while missing his mortal love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). However when Jane discovers a power called the Aether, Thor takes her to Asgard. Just as things get more puzzling, the ancient Dark Elves awaken and attack the Asgardians. To stop the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Christopher Eccelstein) and protect Jane, Thor must do the unthinkable and make an unlikely ally: his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston)

I found The Dark World's story to be straightforward. This is cased example of what you see is what you get. Unfortunately, that was a problem. I wanted to see more from this story. There was bigger then life adventure just waiting to be explored in this film, but it never took off. Yet just because story wasn't perfect, doesn't mean it's a bad plot. The story is easy to get into and it does build itself up. The Dark World indeed has a cinematic tale; but a subplot or two would not have hurt anything.

If there was one thing I could count on, it was the character. The 2011 film gave us two strong characters out of Thor and Loki, so I could only hope for the best in this new film. It is safe to say that both Thor and Loki are established characters; which made it difficult for two to develop any further. Despite that, Hemsworth and Hiddleston continue to impress as the Asgardian pair. Unfortunately I can't say the same for everyone else. At the very least, every character had something to do in this sequel; but I was really hoping for some development. For example, Lady Sif (Jaime Alexander) look as if she was going to receive a prominent importance in this film; but her time never came. This also goes for the film's villain: Malekith. Marvel has been good with their villains, but as a character, Malekith did not go anywhere. He was threatening and nothing more. Then again, if you know his source material, there was not much to work with. The character development could have been better, but the overall performances were good; which saves this element.

Thor: The Dark World continues a trend of Marvel films by being technically flawless. The visuals are a sight to be hold. I was impressed seeing how Alan Taylor's direction in the likes of Asgard differ from Kenneth Branagh. I felt that Alan Taylor explored the ideas created in Thor by furthering the blend of mysticism and science fiction. Along with great visuals came the stunning action. The sequences were another great edition to the Marvel Universe by combining practicality and special effects.

The Dark World had a number of good scenes. To no surprise, one of these moments deals with Thor and Loki together. However, the scene that really stood out was the final battle between Thor and Malekith. Marvel is getting good at making their fights stand out, and this fight was no different. It captures the idea of how these godly characters wood duel, and it did it in a unique fashion.

As the storm begins to settle, it appears that Thor:The Dark World is not as strong as the other Marvel films. There was so much potential in this film to be great; but instead what we got was just a good film. I find that The Dark World is a bridging sequel. This is a kind a film that will help us get from Thor to Thor 3. So there is a point to this movie. Aside from that, the movie was solid enough.  The Dark World may not have been a great sequel, but it was still a good continuation to Thor's Cinematic Adventures.

6085635,3,B00GLPCKX8,"Ok now after that excursion into the wierd world I'd still like for someone to sort of explain how Loki died even though I saw him die but he used his powers to take over the image of his dad Odin and take over the throne after Thor went back to Asgard (Heaven) to tell his dad that he wouldn't want to take the throne because of all the death and destruction that it has and had caused, yes there will be a sequel because there's a short trailer after the credits that I won't give away because the next Captain America is coming up next year 4/2014. I didn't understand where all that jumping between worlds was coming from so I guess those were anomalies, space time continuum stuff.
Some of it didn't make much sense to me because it didn't tie in with the first movie or at least I don't think that it did.
I just don't think that it was as good as the first one. I was watching some pretty funny stuff on YouTube with these guys in bloopers and there was one sequence where Thor was tossing around his hammer pretty good but kept missing but it was dancing around for something that's supposed to be so heavy.",1383868800,4,1115,4.214953271028038
6085636,4,B00GLPCKX8,"Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) slowly but surely gained momentum over the course of five films, eventually culminating with 2012s summer blockbuster, Marvels The Avengers.  After creating arguably the greatest super hero film ever, the question quickly becomes, how do you top that?  Sequels are typically inferior films, but when it comes to the MCU, they simply keep getting better  at least in terms of financial earnings.  While not a direct sequel to The Avengers, Iron Man 3 performed well at the box office (highest grossing film of 2013), telling its own solo story but still picking up the subtle pieces in the aftermath of the Battle of New York.  Iron Man 3 also jump started Phase Two of the MCU, which will reach its conclusion in the summer of 2015 with the already highly anticipated Marvels The Avengers: Age of Ulton.  Until then, we are left with the television drama, Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.D., along with several more solo adventures including Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the next chapter of Phase Two, Thor: The Dark World.

Alan Taylor (HBOs Game of Thrones & The Sopranos) directs the comic book sequel, Thor: The Dark World, starring Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the God of Thunder.  In the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Thor has embarked on a mission to bring peace to the nine realms.  With his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), safely in custody and peace on the horizon, Thor yearns to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman)  despite his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), advising against it.  At the same time, a thought-to-be extinct race, called the Dark Elves, hatch a plan to attack Asgard and enact their revenge for the supposed annihilation of their race.  Stellan Skarsgrd, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, and Rene Russo also star in supporting roles.

About the only drawback of this Thor sequel is that it parallels the first film far too much for comfort.  Both films begin with Thor at a crossroads in his life.  In the first film, he was all about ego, and now, hes all about Jane Foster.  Thors father, Odin, is still reluctant to put his son on the throne, causing a great deal of tension before the two.  Lokis character is also more of the same, mirroring his actions in both Thor and The Avengers.  To be honest, hes mostly still a nuisance  causing more problems than hes worth.  In a mostly humorous turn of events for Loki, it turns out that treason against the Asgardians is grounds for death (which will be discussed as the film goes along), yet launching a major alien invasion against Earth garners nothing more than lifetime imprisonment.  Sure, thats awfully convenient, but its a welcomed ruling, especially since Tom Hiddleston has established himself as a nearly indispensable marketing commodity in the MCU.

The acting quality of this cast is, like the first film, top-notch.  Chris Hemsworth leads the way as the main protagonist, proving that he is worthy of his initial casting as the God of Thunder.  Like Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, its nearly impossible to imagine any other actor as Thor.  Hemsworth is certainly attractive enough, not to mention ripped as all get out, making him both perfect for this role physically and mentally.  His co-star, Natalie Portman, returns as his love interest, Jane Foster.  And, regardless of what the synopsis above states, Jane Foster is the pivotal character in this story  so much so that she nearly overshadows Thor.  Portman is one of the few Hollywoods A-list actresses that will shine no matter what the role may be, and it will quickly become apparent in this film that she would have been far more suited to play a pivotal character, like Ms. Marvel or the Invisible Woman, instead of a limited supporting character like Jane Foster.

As far as the supporting cast goes, there aren't enough adjectives in the dictionary to complement their brilliance.  Tom Hiddleston has established himself superbly as the villainous, untrustworthy God of Mischief, Loki.  At this point, hes clearly benefited from his flawless portrayal of this character (in his third stint) since the writers have obviously gone out of their way to keep incorporating his character in multiple storylines. Once again returning alongside Hiddleston is Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Honestly, what more could anyone possibly say about the powerful Sir Anthony that hasn't already been said?  The same goes for his onscreen wife, Rene Russo, who is the focal point of the films most powerful scene in her role as Thors mother and the Queen of Asgard, Frigga.  Rounding out the noteworthy supporting cast is CBS new comedy star, Kat Dennings, who along with Stellan Skarsgrd, provides the films most humorous moments.  And, last but not least is Jaimie Alexander  returning to her role as Thors other potential love interest, Sir.  Keep an eye of Alexander, folks.  She has the potential to be Hollywoods next big thing.

Sadly, the main villain of this sequel is no better than the villain of the first film  and obviously you cant have Loki doing the major dirty work in every film.  This is also one more characteristic that mirrors the plot of the first film.  Christopher Eccleston portrays Malekith, another one-dimensional bad guy from Thors weak rogues gallery.  Like Colm Feores portrayal as Laufey in the first film, both Malekith and Laufey are vengeful, depth-lacking characters that never, at any point, truly pose a substantial risk  even in spite of this films tragedy.  Tragedy has become a regular occurrence, with the death of Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The First Avenger (and theres no need to spoil his future endeavors) and Agent Coulson in Marvels The Avengers.  Regardless, Malekith is such a poorly established, insignificant villain that finding a real test for Thor in future sequels will be one of the few areas that needs to be addressed.

Overall, Thor: The Dark Ones is a welcomed addition to the MCU, even with its noticeable flaws and resemblance to the first film.  The action and super hero drama is endless, not to mention quite epic. Like the majority of comic book films, theres a little something for everyone in this film  including romance.  Dont misunderstand  this is one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the year.  However, if there is one significant drawback to this film, its the fact that theres nothing monumental that occurs to change the landscape of the MCU.  This sequel is by no means a game changer, but it does set up the next chapter of Phase Two, Guardians of the Galaxy.  With that being said  don't you dare leave your seat until all those credits have passed.  Youll be kicking yourself if you do.  Enjoy.

6085637,5,B00GLPCKX8,"After all the hyperbole the sequel to Thor arrives in theaters today, making the only remaining question surrounding it was it worth the wait?

Yep.

**SPOILER ALERT**
Loosely following Walt Simonson's epic Thor story arc from the eighties when he took over the comic, this movie follows Malekith, leader of the ""Dark Elves"" of Svartalfheim in his odyssey to destroy the universe of light- the Nine Worlds- using a doomsday weapon he created called Aether- a nebulous form of energy he's able to harness.  Malekith attempts to unleash the Aether during the Convergence: a cosmic event where all the realms line up in a syzygy conjunction- all in a row- joining them together.  Defeated by Bor, Odin's father, Malekith retreats with his core forces and goes into suspended animation.  Unable to destroy the Aether, Bor orders it buried somewhere far beyond anyone's reach.  Until now...

Meanwhile, Thor is still cleaning up the mess Loki made of things.  The Nine Worlds are battling vestiges of chaos, wars raging across them all.  Things finally get under control just as a new convergence is beginning; the walls between the dimensions become unstable, causing spatial rifts on Earth.  Jane Foster and her friend Darcy, discover one such portal, which draws Jane in to where she discovers where the Aether is hidden and is contaminated by it, which awakens Malekith.  Thor brings Jane to Asgard to try to help her, rekindling their romance.  The Dark Elves' science allows them to hide from even Heimdall's gaze, and they strike at Asgard looking for Jane.  Loki, ever unrepentant, is languishing in the dungeon when Malekith attacks, and even aids the cause a little, which he soon comes to regret.  Now facing complete annihilation, Thor and his allies form a desperate plan to confront Malekith and destroy the Aether- and they'll need Loki's help to do it.
**END SPOILERS**

This movie was a lot of fun, and in almost every way superior to the first.  The story's tone was darker and much more serious; even though it relied a lot on sci-fi tropes it worked well.  The Dark Elves are more along the lines of super-science than a science/sorcery blend- they're basically a bunch of conquering aliens that for a second or two you'd almost think were Klingons or something from their technology designs.

In our age of 3D filming, there's lots of stuff getting tossed around, large objects being destroyed and things flying all over the place just for the heck of it sometimes, but it doesn't distract too much. In fact, the action is pretty good; there's some excellent fight scenes and nearly every character gets some action in- even Frigga gets to mix it up a little, much to everyone's delight!

The character development is also stellar.  Nearly everyone gets time to shine, especially Loki (natch), and some of his scenes are the best in the flick- the ones when he receives some rather bad news and when he's accompanying Thor on their quest are standouts.  There's a moment of tragedy which binds he and Thor together and helps to secure Loki's aid against the Dark Elves, and it's a tough one but it serves the story well.  Some of the dialogue is pretty cheesy at times, but that's ok.  The humor is also good; not overwhelming things but just enough in the right places to keep things flowing.  And there's a few references to the Marvel Universe, which made for some excellent touches.

Thor: The Dark World is in lots of ways the movie the first one should've been.  It builds upon the franchise's mythology, and takes a couple of turns you won't really expect.  And it's all to the good.  And yeah- you need to stay all the way through the end credits, because that last teaser scene is a kicker!",1383868800,9,3715,4.780564263322884
6085638,5,B00GLPCKX8,"Thor was a film I had wanted to see in the theater, but couldn't get anyone to watch with me. When I did finally see it on DVD, I was actually shocked how good a film it was. Deep characterization, loads of charm, and a wonderful warmth pervaded the film (in addition to some glorious eye candy). Since then a few of the Marvel films have seems to a mis-step here and there. While I enjoyed Iron Man 3, it had neither the dramatic weight of the first Iron Man, nor the pure silly fun of Iron Man 2. And the Avengers film, while also mildly enjoyable simple wasn't up to the standards of films like Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor (I won't list reasons why because my balanced review listing positives and negatives got so much negative hateful feedback I had to pull it). And thus it was that late at night I sat down for Thor:The Dark World, half expecting a deep disappointment and half hoping for a film as good as the original. What I actually saw I never could have seen coming.

The Second Best Film of the Year

Okay, this has been a very interesting year. Between an Andrew Niccol film (The Host), and a Joseph Kosinski visual masterpiece (Oblivion), early on it seemed like nothing could top those two movies for sheer film-making technique. Some people hated the cheesy romance of The Host and should thus avoid Hitchcock romances, and some didn't like Oblivion, because some people just hate sci-fi for whatever reason. Still.. those films were darn good. Then we got White House Down, a masterpiece of Die Hard-style popcorn throwing fun, and Pacific Rim, which is my favorite film of the year (not the best, but it feels so good to watch it has to be my favorite). And just when I thought nothing could ever top Oblivion and the year was all done, Gravity absolutely astounded me with its quality of film-making, rocketing past Oblivion to become the best film of the year. While Thor 2 (what I'll call it for short) isn't better than Gravity, it is definitely the greatest blockbuster film of the year by a long, long way. And here's why.

Simple Technique

Anyone who has read my other reviews for movies should know by now that I am not impressed by hype for the most part. And what other people think of a film couldn't affect my opinion less. But what does impress me is good old-fashioned film-making technique. Were the actors in-character? Was the dialog entertaining and well written? Were the special effects good (and pretty)? Was the music rousing and in-sync with the action? Was there light and color and inspiring moments? And most importantly to me, was there some gosh-darn honest-to-goodness cinematography to be found?

Yes. Yes! Yes!!!!!!!!

I can see someone hating this film for exactly three reasons. 1. They hate the actors. 2. They hate Thor or comic books/sci-fi/blockbusters in general. 3. They have absolutely no taste whatsoever.

As often happens when watching movies, watching this film I was reminded of many scenes in other films. Throne-room scenes, scenes of betrayal, romantic moments, awkward moments, funeral scenes, sci-fi action scenes. You could say that these scenes were just cheap rip-offs of other TV shows, books, and movies. But saying that would make you an idiot. Because every single one of those scenes was not just well done. It was perfectly done. The dramatic scenes will hit you hard. The romantic scenes will make you smile. The awkward scenes will make you laugh. The action scenes will glue your eyes to the screen. And the many, many scenes that just add character development to the film, layers to the story, and glorious, glorious beauty to the film will draw you in, hold your attention, and leave you in simple child-like wonder.

What great film direction looks like

I don't want to knock Ender's Game too much (I already did that in my review) but the biggest failing of that film (which indicated poor direction to me) was that it was poorly paced, spending far too much time on insignificant details and not enough time on important ones. Characters felt shallow and scenes lacked dramatic weight as a result. Likewise, the climax of Man of Steel had no dramatic weight because when you've seen an hour and half of people blasting through buildings doing it one more time (this time with feeling!!!) for a climax leaves you with a major case of burn-out.

Watching Thor 2, it does everything right that those films did wrong. Its pacing is perfect. It take its time when it's important, letting us catch our breath and absorb developments, and it rushes past things that don't really add weight to the story. Things which everyone knew would add more to the film (more Loki! more of the gate-keeper guardian!) were added, but actually given a reason to be there instead of just being empty fan-service. When the climax of the film does come, it's everything a film climax should be. It's filled with action, drama, wit, and hilarity. It's superbly directed, and absolutely perfect.

A round of applause all-around

Everyone, I and do mean everyone...who worked on this film deserves a round of applause. Every actor out-did themselves and surpassed their previous work as their beloved characters. The musical score is fantastic and the composer deserves serious props. The writers gave every character incredible dialog that fit and enhanced their persona even further (no out-of-character dialog to be found). The special effects are everything that Man of Steel and Avengers strove for and lacked, being strikingly surreal, and touchingly beautiful. And the cinematography is master class. The shot composition on this film is so good that I wholeheartedly believe it should be nominated (though I sure it won't be) alongside Gravity, Oblivion, and The Host.

As a film-lover, what more can I say? This it the perfect comic book sci-fi sequel. See it in the theater. Buy the Blu Ray. Peace out.",1383868800,6,5883,4.789940828402367
6085639,5,B00GLPCKX8,"With this movie, the Thor franchise has found its perfect feel. Despite an almost overload of secondary characters, each one feels essential to their moment in the story. While different from the previous film, it picks up right where ""Avengers"" left off in terms of story and feel. The dynamic between Thor and Loki wasn't the usual ""let's just fight all the time"" thing, and you got the feeling that perhaps they had indeed been close at one time in their lives rather than just always enemies.

There is a moment in the film that is the galvanizing hinge to bring Loki into the fight. The ""Coulson"" moment (to borrow an idea from ""Avengers"") doesn't feel like a plot device or like it was thrown in for shock value. Instead, it's a logical progression for the characters and their world.

Yes, it's a breathless film when it finally takes off, and it can get a little overwhelming with all the stuff going on, but even then it just feels like a great next step in Marvel films after ""Avengers"". ""Iron Man 3"" was a faltering step for Marvel this year, but this moving gives me hope for what's ahead in the Marvel movie universe. I also love the mid-credits stinger that sets the stage perfectly for another great Marvel movie coming out next year: ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".",1383868800,3,1276,4.592105263157895
6085640,3,B00GLPCKX8,"How do you spell sensory overload? Visual overload; aural overload; too, too much. Computer Generated Imaging is fine if it augments a good story, but there was so much CGI that the uninitiated (ME!) couldn't decipher the plot. Of course there are the good guys and the bad guys, but some times even the good guys were sorta bad. And some of the bad guys were even worse! But I am NOT a member of the target audience for this one.

Directed by Alan Taylor (""Game of Thrones""), this jumbled slugfest had dismemberments to spare, plus thunderbolts, space ships, and family tiffs among immortals. (Only two little chaste kisses though; it is, after all, PG-13)

  * Natalie Portman (""The Other Boleyn Girl"") returns as Jane Foster, the scientist he left behind...once.

  * Stellan Skarsgrd (""Romeo and Juliet"") is back as Dr. Eric Selvig, the man we first see running naked on a news broadcast. His lecture on the convergence of the planets is received by a singularly bored class...of senior citizens.
  * Idris Elba (""Prometheus"" and ""Luther"") overlooked by Yours Truly in the first Thor, he's back again and I'm glad he is on our side!
  * Zachary Levi (""Tangled"" and ""Chuck"") is the third spear carrier from the left...smile...
  * Ray Stevenson (""Rome"") is Thor's right-hand man.
  * Kat Dennings (""Thor"") is back as Darcy, who provides the too-scarce comic relief. I found myself looking forward to anything with her in it because I could relax a bit and laugh.

A word to the wise: There is the patented Marvel comics ""teaser"" just before the closing credits, but if you are patient and sit through an endless scroll of technicians involved in this project, there is a second teaser!

6085642,4,B00GLPCKX8,"The Full Review for THOR: THE DARK WORLD

Welcome back to yet another hammer swinging fanfare by the famous God of Thunder. Actually no, this isn't what you have expected. Thor was more about the drama but this sequel distracts you with all the bombastic visual and action that you could begin to notice how far it has swayed from the original. In the midst of all that, the tale is revealed. It is neither better nor worse although I would have to say, my eyes were getting fatigue with everything rocketing around at the speed of light.

Mostly everything happened too quickly. When I was trying to savour a moment, the next scene ensues. However, you will get to take a breath from time to time when the action slows down. I do think that The Dark World starts and ends strongly, which helps in getting your bearing right. The narrative played out nicely, with exactly the right tone and tempo by veteran actor, Anthony Hopkins.

What surprised me the most was the two turn of events that are of great importance. So my advice is not to expect anything until you can see it with your own eyes. Well with Loki, the looks can be deceiving too, no? You should probably have known that Thor is asking Loki for help. Their distinct personality is once again the highlight of the film. The time they spent together is going to be a joy to watch. For some of you that might be looking for clues and references from the phase one of the Marvel-verse and the upcoming sequel for the Avengers, you won't be disappointed. Im happy to say that there are plenty of them.

Moving from the story, all the main characters assumed their role nicely. Tom Hiddleston did steal some of the spotlight from Chris Hemsworth for his role as Loki and made it more prominent in aiding the plot progression. Also, he is a far better villain than Malekith, the main antagonist ever can be. Everyone got to have their moment to shine. There were some scenes with Heimdall that showcased some noteworthy performance by Idris Elba.

Would you look at Asgard? Its a perfect sanctuary, a place where the utopian dream comes true. With todays technology, the production team managed to craft a seemingly flawless piece of architecture. Its a good thing as you will spend quite an amount of your time traversing across this plain beauty. London is another setting and is the only one on Earth that was featured in the film.

Aside from whats absolutely the significant aspects of the film, the video and audio presentation are beyond acceptable but they aren't great. It could be an issue with the cinema or it could be just me but I was definitely noticing a little softer picture and an unrefined lower bass. Other than that, its fine with the slight yellowish tint present throughout the film and the overall colour was warm and pleasing to the eye. The surround activity is of course present but I think that the rear channels can be put to greater use. Nonetheless, Brian Tylers score flowed smoothly with the pace of the film and was really enjoyable.

As a whole, director Alan Taylor threw in a good bunch of crew for this worthy sequel to Thor and his directing is surely at its best. You may think of a couple of reasons not to like a sequel like this but its entertaining and desirable enough to capture ones attention throughout the 105 minutes runtime. Do sit back for the post-credit scene for more insight on the Marvel-verse.

Basic Plot - The 9 realms are getting ready to align which will allow heroes and villains to hop from realm to realm and it's up to Thor and company to prevent Malkeith the Dark Elf of olden times from taking (back) over the realms.

I saw Thor this past weekend and it didn't disappoint. The battle scenes were original and they made great use of the environments. The movie had just the right amount of humor tossed in via both comical lines ""Can I have my shoe back?"") & comic character special powers (Loki's abilities allow for some funny scenes).

The movie goers in the theater with me were laughing at the funny parts and oohing and ahhing during the battle sequences so you know the movie was hitting the right notes.
