8538564,4,B0019KLM8Y,"A great high-energy DVD with great trance/electro tracks (the true Ferry Corsten sound !!), amazing atmosphere, fun crowd, and the absolutely great, friendly, and down-to-earth attitude of Ferry Corsten !!!
I gave it 4 starts because: 1. the DVD seems to be too short, with only 15 tracks, one is left wanting to have some more of the Ferry Corsten sound ! and 2. The MC controller is interrupting the music too often and at moments is certainly annoying, I would recommend Ferry to not use MC controller if possible.
Overall, I enjoyed this DVD so much and would recommend it to all trance fans, thank you Ferry !!!
When I watched it, I certainly felt the atmosphere of a Ferry Corsten party, can't wait till I see him perform again!
Full On Ferry !!!",1228435200,,752,4.5777777777777775
