2649864,5,B000I0QN0I,"This DVD is very well done. It discusses the details of Jesus' life that never get talked about. How he was a master and what he went through.

It is very well researched, as the author Dr. Miceal Ledwith was a theology professor as well as was a catholic priest and worked closely with the pope at the time. He knows his stuff! I reccomend this DVD highly for anyone, and especially for those who want to learn the truth about Jesus.

I also love his first DVD in this series, ""Secrets of the Hamburger Universe"". Which really opens our eyes to how we view God. Really great stuff. And important in these times we live in.",1167696000,11,623,4.316239316239316
2649865,5,B000I0QN0I,"The description of this DVD is concise.

It is well researched and flows well.

In this DVD Dr Ledwith continues with the history of a western Christ named Jesus. Through his research I now better understand Jesus' journeys prior to returning to the Holy Land at the age of 30~.

A question: Is it possible that when Christians celebrate his life, instead of his death, they can then witness the fabled ""second coming?"" :-)",1161475200,12,423,4.6891891891891895
2649906,5,B000I0QN0I,"This DVD set is terrific.  Dr. Ledwith has gone to tremendous lengths to reveal many things that traditional religion has kept secret for centuries.  By all means, pay close attention to this one!",1187913600,2,196,4.909090909090909
2649907,5,B000I0QN0I,"The most disaponting thing to me about Christianity is the fact that so much of ""Jesus the Crist"" life is never given to us and so we never really know who Jesus really was and therefore we are left really weak.  This work gives us a glimpse of who Jesus really was and that is the ultimate gift one could ever recieve in their lives.",1185321600,3,334,4.138461538461539
2649908,5,B000I0QN0I,A very revealing story about someone who for the past 2 thousand years have become such an icon and yet how little if any thing we know of him.,1178928000,14,143,3.9655172413793105
2649909,5,B000I0QN0I,"I am totally enjoying this DVD ""How Jesus Became a Christ"".  It makes me think outside the box and realize that everything we have been told all of our lives by the traditional religious groups isn't necessarily the truth.  I love hearing different opinions and this guy is Spot On !!",1176163200,8,284,4.549019607843137
2649910,2,B000I0QN0I,"How do you know Ramtha is true? There is proof that Jesus of Nazareth was crucified by the Romans. But there is no proof of the physical existence of Lemuria. Ditto for Atlantis. Why did JZ Knight sue a woman in Germany for channelling her Ramtha so she could have exclusive rights to bring him forth? If Ramtha is such a great guide how come he couldn't prevent JZ Knight's four failed marriages??????

Is Christianity a deception? If so, how come Ramtha is not? Jesus died on the cross. Ramtha ascended into the ether after a long life.  Why should we believe Ramtha whose sole messenger is a woman of interesting reputation? After 2000 years much mystery is still there on Jesus of Nazareth.

The truth is: By their fruits you shall know them. What fruits has JZ Knight borne? What good has come of Ramtha?",1175385600,9,809,4.527397260273973
2649911,2,B000I0QN0I,"I am sorry to say that this so called DVD is a complete and utter waste of money. Far from me to cast an opinion on Dr Ledwith, yet this highly un-professional school boy type movie should not have even got past the teacher, let alone onto the market. If this were free, i would still feel that i had wasted my time watching this amature, super low budget disk together, but to charge top $ ----- i must have been crazy.....

The best Dr Ledwith could do with this poorly put together piece of film would be to put it on his hamburger web-site free of charge.

I think Dr Ledwith has been in the USA too long,,,, nice guy, just ripping us off though.

Sorry Dr Ledwith - i waited and wanted a good movie here, what i got was a 5 year old childs version of making a movie....

In short,,,,, don't buy it",1174867200,12,802,4.089171974522293
2649912,1,B000I0QN0I,"Was this DVD made as a high school project? Because it certainly does not come across as professionally made. Whilst some of what Dr. Ledwith had to say was of interest, it took well over an hour of the first DVD to actually describe - very briefly - what Jesus actually did when he was in India, and this is supposed to be earth shaking? I'm sorry but to me it was mostly repeating old, previously stated and published material that anyone with any interest in the subject can find. And the DVD is so poorly put together, very long periods of talking, interspered with the odd picture that is not always entirely relevant and the music! Don't waste your money buying this, do some research yourself and buy some books instead.",1172966400,33,727,4.515151515151516
2649913,1,B000I0QN0I,If I ever hear hamburger universe again I shall become nauseated.  The biggest waste of money I ever spent.  He rambles on and on with no proof of what he says beyond vague reference.  It is three hours and twenty minutes of ego driven drivel.,1172966400,13,243,4.355555555555555
2649914,5,B000I0QN0I,It has always bothered me since childhood about the missing years in Jesus' life. Miceal Ledwith answers this mystery in this DVD. He speaks of an upcoming DVD that includes the description of the missing gospel of Thomas. I can't wait to see it.,1172275200,11,246,4.613636363636363
2649915,4,B000I0QN0I,"This video give many new thoughts of Christ in different point of view.

Disk 1 mostly has the same story of video Jesus in Tibet but there are many additional thoughts and symbolism of Christ in the ealier ages in Disk 2.",1168300800,3,222,4.285714285714286
8142827,5,B000I0QN0I,"I first learned of Miceal Ledwith from the movie ""What the bleep do we know"" and I enjoyed his perspectives on various religious concepts. So needless to say I'm enjoying the DVD, it is a lot of material to digest but for me that's what research and study require. time to absorb the material. This DVD requires some cross referencing to balance and sustain the issues discussed, so time invested is a necessity.",1483315200,,412,4.657534246575342
8142828,5,B000I0QN0I,"The author, Miceal Ledwith, is the most learned, brilliant man I have ever met in my life. I was honored to be a friend of his and a student of his lectures as well. I recommend this book as highly as one possibly can. It will wake you up to who you, and all of us truly are. Please read.",1472515200,,288,3.816666666666667
8142829,5,B000I0QN0I,"I found it useful. Some of the bad reviewers make some comparisons which I feel are not really fair. This is not meant to be an action flick or a blockbuster film... it presents a man speaking about his own research, experience, study and opinion and the story he presents is very interesting, especially because of his church background and his own beliefs versus the beliefs of his religion as a whole. I was engrossed and watched with great interest.",1418774400,,453,4.675
8142830,5,B000I0QN0I,"En Venezuela y America Latina la mayora de los paradigmas han sido sembrados por la Iglesia Catlica. Las creencias en esos pueblos es que ser rico es malo, que solamente son salvados si aceptan a Jess como su nico salvador, que los curas solamente son los que absuelven los ""pecados"". En fin, este Documental es necesario que todo el mundo lo analice y discuta para que nos demos cuenta que existen otros senderos, otras verdades y sobre todo no encasillarnos a lo que nos dice unas Instituciones creadas por el hombre como las Iglesias.

8142831,5,B000I0QN0I,"Currently, the entire species of Homo-Sapien is evolving and mutating into a different species - a Homo-Luminous.  Homo-Luminous is not carbon-based, but is silicon-based.  This is a physical transition.  Carbon and silicon are the only two elements that can support life.  Silicon has an electronic structure analogous to that of carbon, but is the lightest of these elements.

As our species evolves to its next level, our consciousness must also evolve.  We must leave the ""duality consciousness"", in which we perceive ourselves to be separate from God, and unite as a ""single consciousness"" with God!

Soon after birth, you created your own, individual ego - an ego that has limited your reality.  Throughout your entire life, your ego has led you to believe that there are two consciousness - yours and your neighbor's, yours and your spouse's, yours and God's, etc.  In actuality, all beings share ONE consciousness, which is why we all experience the ""reality"" in which we live in exactly the same way.

In 1997, this planet moved into a 4th dimension.  This dimension makes it possible for you to increase your level of awareness of this ""perceived"" reality and break through it.  It allows you to increase your understanding of how Jesus became a Christ and how he performed the miracles that he did.  It allows you to use the Laws of Attraction to do the same.",1225670400,4,1370,4.904347826086957
8142832,5,B000I0QN0I,"Very interesting book, very informative. It helps understand Jesus, his role, and how he relates with other masters of humanity. Highly recommended documentary.",1225238400,,160,6.0
8142833,5,B000I0QN0I,"For those of you who don't think you already know everything about Jesus, this is a very insightful, exciting film. Miceal Ledwith is a very intelligent, experienced man. He was a priest for about 25 years and assistant to the pope. Watch 'About The Author' first (on the 2nd disc) then go back to disc 1 and watch the film.",1208995200,4,324,4.416666666666667
8142834,5,B000I0QN0I,"Let me first say that I consider myself to be a Christian and I feel that there are many others out there who have become disenchanted with the modern day westernized perspective of the historical Jesus. After hearing Miceal Ledwith's insightful commentaries on What the Bleep Do We Know?, I was interested to hear some more from him. So, I purchased this DVD and the Deep Deceptions DVD as well. Upon my first viewing of ""How Jesus became the Christ,"" I was quite surprised to hear such a controversial view of his life. For me, it presented a refreshing alternative to consider, and with some thoughtful anlysis has some weighty theorhetical points to ponder. For the most part this information has enabled me to ask deeper questions  about my faith and how I am to align myself with the bigger world picture. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has perhaps become intolerant with the status quo mindset that permeates the Church today. Sometimes, in order to see the sun you must go to another window...",1205798400,9,1018,4.719101123595506
8142835,5,B000I0QN0I,"Supurb!  Excellent!  Truth!  Knowledge.  Dr. Micael Ledwith is a fabulous speaker and teacher.  I cannot wait for his other DVDs.  Thank you, Dr. Ledwith.",1201824000,,154,5.208333333333333
8142836,5,B000I0QN0I,"I was fascinated with this dvd set. Though some of the information presented is repeated several times, I found that to be helpful rather than simply repetitive.  Seems the story of Jesus we been told for so many years lacks a great deal of detail, and has been mis-leading at best. The real truth of Jesus, once discovered, will yield far greater beauty than currrently believed possible. Also fascinating to me is that this same information is now breaking from multiple fields, locations and individuals' studies. Similar accounts and research have crossed my path in the form of historical and theological works.  Hmmmm - can't wait for the next dvd by Miceal!",1192060800,5,664,4.919642857142857
