2919558,1,B000UAE7NQ,"THE LAIR is truly disappointing on so many levels, one has to list them:

1) If you're expecting hot guys like on DANTE'S COVE, forget it.

2) Bad acting and insipid plots.

3) Overall production quality is worse than either DANTE'S COVE or the quality-production of the detective series set in Albany, also a HERE! product.

4) If there was FF male nudity, I didn't notice it, perhaps too busy FFing thru the episodes, mysteriously 6 half hour segments split between two DVDs, I suppose to justify a Boxed Set format, which is more prestigious.

5) The gay vampire club masquerading as sex club in THE LAIR is also manned by the same bleached blond ""actor"" and looks and operates like the sex club featured on season two of DANTE'S COVE.  Why?  Don't know.

To sum, for camp fun and better production values and great-looking guys, far better to stick with DANTE'S COVE, even if it is a long wait between seasons.",1192579200,38,914,4.598765432098766

I contacted Amazon and told them what the problem was, and Amazon authorized me to return it... I did send it back to the seller, but I never hear from neither Amazon or the seller...

I frankly like this very much and hope the creator continues to grow and develop, that's what it all about keep up the good work. I liked this book very much. I enjoyed this book very much because it was just what I was looking for. I try to spread out my reading to keep a wide variety following. This book kept my interest. I liked the balance, the development of the characters and the over all pictures created. I share my reviews with two book clubs, one in New York and the other here in Aspen. I love to share reviews of book as it is so positive and I get great tips. This book will be an added showcase. I try my best to give either a positive review or nothing at all, negative review are worthless to me and those in our book clubs, we look for the positive.

2919574,3,B000UAE7NQ,"Gay  males  finally get our own vampire story. Yes, gay vampires/witches are running a sex club called ""The Lair""  that is actually a front for more sinister activities. Newspaper journalist Thom (David Moretti) investigates a series of ""John Doe Murders"" linked to The Lair.  Vampire Lord Damien (Peter Stickles) discovers that Thom looks like the reincarnation of his  former lover, whom he betrayed, 200 years ago. Fellow vampire Colin (Dylan Vox) sees this as the perfect opportunity to bring about Damien's downfall.
  ""The Lair"" is campy and gratuitous. There's lots of sex and nudity thrown in for, mostly,  no good reason-- except, perhaps-- it is included because you can do that on cable. The acting and dialogue are, mostly, terrible. So, why am I giving ""The Lair"" three stars? Because I think it's good, campy, gay fun. It's all over the top; and I think that was the intention. Plus, Stickles and Vox do exude the necessary charisma and sex appeal in the lead vampire roles. Vox's Colin, looking like a carbon copy of Kiefer Sutherland in ""The Lost Boys"", is a sexy, smarmy brat who can't wait to usurp Damien's/Stickles' power.
  If you're an adult who wants some campy, sexy fun, instead of scares, for Halloween, I do recommend these six episodes of ""The Lair."" Just enjoy it for what it is; but don't expect anything else. Plus, Season One of ""The Lair"" was just campy/interesting enough to make me want to watch Season Two.",1256169600,4,1442,4.82520325203252

One of the two performers who doesn't completely embarrass himself is ex-porn star Colton Ford, but since the director decided to ""Just for Men"" all over his head, he looks rather odd.

2919580,2,B000UAE7NQ,"As far as entertainment goes this is not the worst serial I have ever come accross but it smells rank like lost opportunities.

Set somewhere in the US, presumably along the coast in a not too large town, the serial -each episode ends with a cliffhanger- tries to mesh small town thriller, vampire flair, soft core gay sex and some social issues in the pot of gay subculture and underworld.

All this is done by a very low budget: in a time when we are accustomed to expensive special effects this forces the viewer to adjust his expectations, but personally speaking I do not find it too difficult,
provided the other forces at play are up to the task.
Here such forces cannot be rated too highly but the general result is acceptable. More or less.

The first thing I wish to pinpoint is that the six short (about half an hour) episodes that make up the first ""season"" are unfortunately divided in two, the first three being by far better done.
In the second part, where atmosphere creation, settings establishing and character building leaves the place to action, the script becomes much more hurried; acting, filming and direction become less and less convincing as if time and money had been at an end by then.

Not that acting or script were THAT good in the first place: one can hardly point out an original scene or conversation; as far as actors are concerned, the only one I could watch with no complaint was Beverly Lynne -the only woman- as Laura: she is pretty, she has a pleasant voice and appears at ease in front of the camera. Truth to be told she is served with the best character and by the best lines of the script.
Former gay porn star Colton Ford as the Sheriff is such a handsome stud as to make one nearly forget the silly lines he is given: he does not appear to have had a great training as an actor but he can be watched without pain and I am not telling this because he is gorgeous: he is the only main character in the show who is always fully dressed.
Brian Nolan would not be bad were he not constantly over the top.
Dylan Vox as Colin has some good moments, especially when he manages to keep his voice soft and expressive, elsewhere he is mediocre and not quite as handsome as most of the cast -body builders, all buff, all quite attractive_ is.
Jesse Cutlip and David Moretti are simply there, they pronounce their lines and that is all. Though I suppose they could be considered good looking, even their looks left me cold.
Peter Stickles was presumably cast because of his actor skills, being far from handsome, but his performance is convincing only at times and sounds overwrought or shabby everywhere else.

This serial can be entertaining if watched with little expectations and no intermission between the six parts. It can be a couple of hours of simple fun spoilt by the the rather longish previews and by the sloppy production and editing: one reviewer has rightly mentioned wounds that move from one spot to the other but this is not the worst slip by far.",1211500800,6,3000,4.497247706422018

  Well there's not to much to say about this one. Everyone compares it to Dante's Cove which i do love, But this is no where near.

2919593,1,B000UAE7NQ,"I laughed when I watched Lair - and not because there were any intentionally funny segments.  There was only one person with any acting skills was Brian Nolan, but his Frankie charactor was unbelievable starting with the first scene he was in.  The laughable moments continued with another character getting bitten on the right side of his neck in one scene - and then he is shown in the hospital with a bandage on the left side of his neck.  Nobody was paying attention to the writing, the acting or editing it seems.

Maybe it is because I'm spoiled with great television entertainment like BTVS Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel and Tru Calling.  Did Lair make it beyond season one?  I saw mention of Season Two being scheduled to air.  I'm very surprised.  If it makes it further than Tru Calling did, I'll be very upset.  A waste of time and money in my opinion.

2919597,1,B000UAE7NQ,"To all those reading this, I hope you take the time to consider.  I will not say that this video is a waste of your time and money.  I will say it was a waste of mine though.  The concept was a good idea.  However, they fell short of the supposed intended target.  This series is severely lacking in the detail work that makes a series great.  Their hero is painted a hero from the beginning, he isn't made to stand the trails that make a hero.  While the ""bad-guy"" (in my opinion, the hottest guy on the show) lacks the depth and definition that made him a villian.

This show is only focusing on the young and shallow.  If they wanted to attack all genres of the community, a little action, a dash of humor appropriately placed, and a well-served villian who knows how to act with a flair.  Garnish the serving with some well placed hi-jinxs that is sure to keep the audience feeding out of their hand.  That, and you could have picked a better looking hero.

One of the key differences between DANTE'S COVE and THE LAIR is that THE LAIR has no cliff-hangers or segways.  Everything here is cut and dry as you would expect a vampire to act.  Undead or alive, this series lacks the backbone to make it a true cult classic in the gay community.  Hope they have better luck next time around.",1193184000,36,1290,4.2946058091286305

It should be obvious that I certainly didn't watch this for plot; it's not that I find the concept of gay vampires ridiculous(me being a gay male myself) but it was handled quite...well...let's just say I'm not particularly a fan. Again, I concede to the superficial reason behind my watching this series being the vampire men, and with a storyline so ridiculous I don't feel even a modicum of shame for it. Though the vampires are indeed sexy and seductive, it doesn't really save the show. I fail to see why so many gay-targeted show such as these depict great abundances of sex scenes feeding into the promiscuous stereotype of gay males...but Here!
