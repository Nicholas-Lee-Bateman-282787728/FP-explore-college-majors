8125287,3,B000FP2Z0I,"Baron Gilles de Lancre (Paul Naschy- HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB, VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES, THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK) seeks out an alchemist in order to attain the throne. Said alchemist agrees to help, but requires the blood of a young maiden. The Baron hurriedly abducts a beautiful maiden, offering her up for sacrifice. Unfortunately for de Lance, he also needs to possess the legendary Philosopher's Stone. In the meantime, he passes the hours torturing and killing his subjects. Much hocus pocus ensues. At one point, a rubber head w/ a bad wig is employed as an oracle. DEVIL'S POSSESSED is another fairly entertaining Naschy vehicle. He's always at his best when portraying sadistic, eeevil villains. Unfortunately, this film also contains several lonnng stretches of dullness. Still, it's worth watching, especially for the Nashy fanatic...",1402963200,2,851,5.218978102189781
8125288,3,B000FP2Z0I,I just bought this from Sinister Cinema and here is the long and short of it. The DVD is struck from a pristine print and is gorgeous. That's the lone good part of this review. The IMDB lists the running time at 95 minutes while the DVD clocks in at 86 minutes. Think there has been some serious editing? You bet. I compared this version to my ancient VHS dub and ALL the nudity and most of the gore has been amatuerishly edited out. You can tell by the jump cuts in the DVD print. The DVD offers only the English dubbed audio track and it is bad. You can tell they have 6 people doing all the voices. The dubbed voice of Nashy is especially miscast. I was surprised that Sinister Cinema chose this version to release as they are reknowned for presenting uncut prints in their releases. This is a disappointment and would only be useful to the Nashy completists in the crowd.,1289347200,8,875,4.3090909090909095
8125289,3,B000FP2Z0I,"This Spanish production stars Paul Naschy as French Marshall Giles De Lancre, ruler and major pain in the butt to the residents of his village.  From his mountain castle, and with the urging of his evil wife and her alchemist colleague, he sacrifices villagers, ostensibly for not being able to afford to pay their taxes, but really to collect their blood for rituals aimed at acquiring the infamous ""Philosopher's Stone"", key to power and omniscience.  Our hero, Captain Gaston, returns from the wars to find that his old friend Naschy is not quite the nobleman he used to be.  He joins in with a gang of rebels who plot to storm the castle, rescue the captured fair maiden, and put an end to the reign of terror.

The film's assets are the costumes and scenery, which are right out of a medieval painting.  And while the cover promises a gore-fest, the violence is fairly reasonable by today's standards.  (In one scene, just as a prisoner is about to become headless, a character moves into the screen and blocks the view.) The action scenes vary in quality:  some of the swordplay is excellent, while others display poor editing.  (Captain Gaston, however, does more acrobatics than I've seen a period action hero do since Burt Lancaster). The film is also curiously different in that more men than women get the dungeon treatment.  The acting is probably good, but poorly dubbed--unfortunately, there is no option to listen to the original voices and view subtitles, which I would have preferred.  Another annoying factor--which seems to be a characteristic of Spanish horror films from this era--is the use of weird electronic sounds to convey something evil going on.  Not only is it jarringly different from the rest of the score, but it completely detracts from the whole days-of-yore ambiance.

Naschy fans are cautioned that this is not a werewolf, vampire or any other kind of horror movie.  It's just old-fashioned medieval nastiness.  Mildly entertaining, probably OK for an evening rental if you like this kind of thing.  It just could have been better.",1217635200,5,2068,4.902298850574713
8125290,5,B000FP2Z0I,"This movie has lots of scenes with a shady old alchemist dude sporting a long beard and black robes and hat who works in a room with no proper wall structure amongst many candles and beakers and such, who is in cahoots with the Count's wife to procure peasant maidens to get their blood for his alchemical recipes, lots of scenes of Satan worship during human sacrifice amongst crumbling ruins, lots of scenes of a torture chamber, swordplay, jousting, castles, in short this movie is great if you like all that kind of thing.",1186099200,4,526,4.6063829787234045
