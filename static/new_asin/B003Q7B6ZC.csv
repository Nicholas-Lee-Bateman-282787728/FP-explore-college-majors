Started out great but half way into the first disc it froze up. Tried second disc same thing half way into the show it to froze up. Tried discs on different DVD players and same results. It's a shame because so much time has gone by and $40.00 dollars wasted. Looking at the reviews and a lot of other customers are having the very same issue. You know the manufacture knows what's going on and should have a recall and make it right. The one star is for the lousy product not the movie.",1507939200,3,609,4.169491525423729

We thought it was our DVD player so when Best Buy ran a special price on a Sony this week (2/19/17) we purchased one thinking our freezing up problems would be solved. NOT!!! It still freezes up. Upon close inspection of the disc there are scratches and junk on every one of the disc. Our son purchased these on Dec. 27, 2016, shipping came from ""Solo Enterprise"". The invoice said ""BRAND NEW"". I just tried to return them (2/21/17) to Amazon and they turned me down. I will NEVER purchase anything from either of these company's!!!

4166162,3,B003Q7B6ZC,"I'm a bit disappointed with this set. I was excited when I received it. The shows themselves are fantastic and deserve a 5 star treatment, but it's incredible to me that there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired. I don't usually complain about these types of things, but the sound quality of the Lonesome Dove shows are not very good and since there are no subtitles, I have to keep rewinding and listening again. It just got a bit too much work for me, I'm afraid, and the entertainment value was lost so I had to shut it off. Does anyone know if there is a different Lonesome Dove package that either has better sound quality or subtitles to help out people like me? Again, I'm really not knocking the show, I love it. This package just isn't friendly to those of us who want to actually HEAR what's being said. I purchased Comanche Moon, which is a prequel to Lonesome Dove and a lot less popular, and even it had subtitles, so I was able to enjoy it immensely.

4166246,1,B003Q7B6ZC,"Ordered this as a Christmas present for my elderly mother.  She had recorded the original on VHS when it was aired and she enjoyed watching it so much she had worn out the tape.  This was one time mom actually asked for something this specific, so I was really happy to get it for her.  Unfortunately, a few days after Christmas when I called she said she was so disappointed. She couldn't watch it because the DVD's had problems.  One of the disks played a while and then the audio started dropping out.  She tried another and it started skipping and eventually the picture froze.  I ordered her a replacement, but when it arrived, same thing. She has been able to play other DVD's without problems but just to be sure my sister took the set to her house and tried them (the second set) on her DVD player and they had the same problems.  Obviously, the DVD's are bad.  Since this is the second bad set I don't know if it's worth trying another one from Amazon or trying elsewhere.  I see a few other reviews citing similar problems, but the majority are good so I have to believe it's a bad batch or something.",1357516800,58,1111,4.354368932038835
4166247,5,B003Q7B6ZC,"This is the best western movie ever made.  The actors live the scenes.  This is probably the best movie ever made, because it effects you emotionally after watching it.  You feel the pain and joy of the people as you watch the story develop.  When someone is killed, you can feel the sense of loss.  After watching this video, you feel you have made the cattle drive from Texas to Montana.  You can feel the sense of joy from completeing the trip and the pain of losing you friends (family) along the way.",1357257600,,505,4.376344086021505

4166251,5,B003Q7B6ZC,"I really don't think there is much I can add to all the praise that this series has already received, and is well deserved.  There is no doubt that the original Lonesome Dove movie is the very best of them all.  But Return To Lonesome Dove is probably the best sequel ever made that follows a true blockbuster.  Although Streets of Laredo can't live up to the near perfection of Lonesome Dove, it's still a worthy film to see, and by itself is a fine western drama that holds much of the same style and writing precision that the Dove series contains.  And the extras that are included in this set are both interesting and well done. If you're a true Lonesome Dove lover like me, then you really can't get enough of the movie, the writer behind it all, and the story of its production.

One thing I feel I would like to add is that if you have never seen or heard of Lonesome Dove, I can't recommend enough that you read and watch it, even if you are or have never been into a western in your life.  What makes this series such a winner in my opinion is not the action and old west style violence that it contains here and there, (but much less than most westerns), but the dazzling dialogue that is both expertly created in the book and reproduced in the film that really draws a reader in and keeps them there. I was completely absorbed in it in both the series and the book and it never ceased to amuse, captivate, and amaze me.  It's a true masterpiece for just that alone in my opinion. Absolutely fabulous...  This is solid deal for the whole shebang and them some, and I offer it my highest recommendation... : )",1355529600,28,1619,4.285245901639344

In every set I have seen there have been multiple scratches on the disks. The real problem is disk # 1, second part, entitled, ""Return to Lonesome Dove"". This is the third set I now have. This set shouuld be in everyones home- really that good. I would really like Amazon to just send me the one disk to complete the set,but after all this time they may say for me to send it back and they will return my money. I really love the set.
