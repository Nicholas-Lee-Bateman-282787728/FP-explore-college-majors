2745507,2,B000MRNWR4,"This movie might be okay for children under age one, but don't waste your money buying it for toddlers.  My two year old daughter loves Sesame Street, but she has absolutely no interest in this movie.  I think it was kind of boring to her.  It would be better if they showed more of the Sesame Street characters, but instead they show children playing with their parents, either crawling around or running.  Just not that much of an attention grabber.",1250812800,,451,4.6
2745508,5,B000MRNWR4,"I think these videos are wonderful, and very educational. I watch them with my daughter. I love to watch her smile and laugh at the baby characters. I recommend them to everyone. I loved sesame street when I was growing up. Now she can enjoy them too.",1223942400,,251,4.361702127659575
2745509,5,B000MRNWR4,"I bought this dvd for my son who is now 2 1/2 but my 1 year LOVES it. After playing this dvd twice, she already knew one song. It's very simple but a great away to enjoy a few minutes just moving. My son is not a moving person so he just sit and enjoy the music. I'm happy with this product.",1214956800,,291,3.7096774193548385
2745510,5,B000MRNWR4,"I firmly believe the less TV, the better, for young children and I rate this highly just the same.

My 3 year old daughter loves this--and insists that someone plays it with her! So we dance and sing and call each other by the muppets' names for the whole time, which is a lot of fun.

Sarah Jessica Parker is a joy to watch when she cuddles and plays with her little daughter, who clearly is used to enjoying books.

The reason I took the time to add to the five stars here is that I didn't see my favorite part of this mentioned: the real-life parents/families interacting within the muppet segments.  Unlike other Sesame Beginnings, this DVD shows plus size adults, older parents, least one parent of a special needs child, even several parents of multiple children.  These families are far easier to relate to than the previous Sesame Beginnings parents, who all looked like LL Bean models.",1213747200,6,894,4.59748427672956
2745511,5,B000MRNWR4,"We loved this video.  We are very selective about what our kids (2 and 3 1/2 year) watch and their viewing time is also very limited.  This is one program I recommend.  They love seeing Baby Elmo and Big Bird and then imitating the games they play (these games are worth imitating unlike some shows).  Regular Sesame Street looses their interest, but they are drawn into the songs and games on this show.",1203292800,,404,4.493150684931507
2745512,5,B000MRNWR4,This was a hard-to-find product - except at Amazon.com. It is exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  Will definitely shop at Amazon.com again.,1198540800,,158,4.851851851851852
2745513,5,B000MRNWR4,I highly recommend all the Sesame Beginnings DVD's for your pre-schoolers. My daughter is 9 months old and has loved these from birth. They taught her how to dance! She just started moving to the music one day.,1179273600,,210,4.552631578947368
2745514,5,B000MRNWR4,"This dvd is great for toddlers. Toddlers of all ages seem to love Elmo no matter how ""old"" he is in the DVD.

The Sesame Beginnings dvd's are fun and educational. I'd reccomend them to moms who want to keep thier kids entertained for a few short moments while doing other tasks like cleaning, etc.",1173484800,,297,4.4
2745535,5,B000MRNWR4,The best! My baby really enjoys it! I wish there were more Sesame Street videos like this one. My daughter loved it when she was a baby and now my son does too.,1393632000,,160,3.878787878787879
2745536,5,B000MRNWR4,These movies can keep my son interested for hours! They're very cute and totally worth buying more then one of them!,1393545600,,116,4.571428571428571
2745537,5,B000MRNWR4,"My toddler and I like this video.  Since my toddler likes to move a lot, this video is something he enjoys to watch with me and move around.",1378684800,,140,4.0
2745538,3,B000MRNWR4,"My son still likes the first ""Beginning Together"" video the best. This one's ok, but I prefer the original and the ""Make Music"" videos.",1367452800,,135,4.666666666666667
2745539,5,B000MRNWR4,"We loved this one so much, we ended up buying the whole series from Amazon.

My daughter was a late bloomer when it came to walking. At 14 months old, we purchased this DVD. The ""Baby Steps"" song with Big Bird and his Noni actually helped my daughter learn to walk. She would stand and my mother and I would sing the song and take little steps to encourage her...Within 3 weeks, she was running around the house.

She cherishes the Sesame Street characters now, which I firmly believe, has increased her love of learning!",1366243200,,521,4.473684210526316
2745540,5,B000MRNWR4,These are just to cute! My son is almost 2 and would not sit still to watch anything but loves these! It teaches them different values. He loves to sing and dance along with them!,1333584000,,179,4.142857142857143
2745541,2,B000MRNWR4,"I have several of these videos. My 3 month old loves ""making music together."" Of course ""making music together"" is better for small babies because they like music and you should always sing to them. ""Moving together"" is for babies that can already move a lot more, walk, etc...so maybe that's part of the reason I didn't like it. I found the songs a lot less catchy and the situations a lot less cute in general. I don't really like the presence of Sarah Jessica Parker, maybe because I associate her with ""Sex and the City"" and she just seems out of place on a video for babies. The child with her is also not hers, so that makes her seem a bit poser-ish.",1321228800,,656,4.298387096774194
2745542,4,B000MRNWR4,"I bought this dvd because it was also in spanish and my baby only watches it in spanish. She is 6 months old and likes watching the fluffy figures, she smiles and dances with them. I don't give it 5 stars because although they use good spanish the names of the characters remain in english eventhough they have their own name in spanish.",1297900800,,337,4.365079365079365
2745543,3,B000MRNWR4,"This is cute, but we liked the others from the series even more. We ordered this because we like ""Sara Jessica Parker.""  She was good in it. The others seemed to have cuter songs and seemed more active and exciting to our son, but we plan to try this some more. I have noticed that with babies and children, sometimes they do not take to something right away, but they end up loving it after trying again.",1267488000,,405,4.259740259740259
2745544,5,B000MRNWR4,"This entire series is fabulous! My daughter is now 20 months old and has been watching these for months. She still enjoys them. One of favorite moments recently was when my daughter suddendly kissed my cheek after watching Elmo kiss his Dad. It was priceless! I would recommend these to any new parent or to be given as gifts. You will catch yourself singing the songs to your child. The messages are not only great for kids, but reminders for parents. Bravo Sesame!",1258848000,,466,4.626506024096385
8171475,5,B000MRNWR4,"My 1-1/2 year old loves it!! He asks for Elmo constantly and it seems he gets a lot of what's going on in the video. The only problem is we have to ffw through the psychologist's explanation in the beginning because he sometimes gets distracted; it's not very entertaining for him. Other than that, great product!",1487030400,,313,4.607142857142857
