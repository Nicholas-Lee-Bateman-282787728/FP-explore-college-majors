8587439,4,B0063GNBNS,"After reading that the American formated DVD is a terrible dub, I decided to purchase this DVD.  I was glad to find that it is in Russian with English subtitles.  The movie quality is at times similar to a made for TV movie, but that does not bother me so much.  I was also glad that the movie incorporated the spiritual aspect of St. Alexander and didn't make him out to be just some sort of secular war hero such as the old school black and white movie from the 1930s.  It could have incorporated more of his Orthodox faith but it does come off as an Orthodox film.  It does have the guard Philip mention about St Boris and Gleb on the boats.  This also focuses on the battle at the Neva river and not the battle on the frozen lake Chud.  It is bloody and violent, after all it is a war movie, but more so that what would appear in a Western Christian type film.  I just finished reading some of St. Alexander's life and it does seem to follow it, but is also incorporates other non-Historical elements for the sake of making the movie.  The subtitles are ok, but I do recall some points where it comes off as broken English; they get the job done.",1463961600,,1150,4.1909090909090905
