1906216,5,B0000AINIZ,"There's so much that can be said about Selena's last concert on Sunday, February 26, 1995, recorded live at the Houston Astrodome. This concert was done exactly 1 month and 5 day before her untimely death. I too, was lucky enough to attend that wonderful concert. I was seat Section: 760A; Row D, Seat 3. Selena put on an excellent, excellent show that night. She was beautifully dressed in a purple bellbottom jumper, which she had designed. Although deceased, listening to even the Selena Live, The Last Concert Cd, released on March 27, 2001, puts you right there! Selena y Los Dinos greatest strength as a band was there Live concerts, and this concert was proof. Selena did this concert during the time period when she was working on her posthumous Dreaming Of You cd. After just finishing her ride on the horse and carriage, Selena started off the concert, saying: ""How ya doing, Houston, Texas, and immediately began the Disco Medley. I will never forget how loud the crowd was that night. And from there, she went into her hits such as: Amor Prohibido, Baila Esta Cumbia, Tus Despricios, Cobarde, Techno Cumbia, LA Carcacha, No Me Queda Mas, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Si Una Vez, El Chico Del Apartamento 512, Ya Ves, and then the finale, Como La Flor, in which in the beginning, Selena did her legendary smile. This was an unforgettable night. I too, have been waiting a long, long, time for this release. Although, I did tape this concert off Tv, when it had come on, just 2 weeks after her death, I still believe in supporting the Quintanilla family and will buy several copies of this extraordinary concert. And I would just like to say to Selena, ""Dondequiera Que Estes, (in heaven), You did an excellent, excellent, excellent Job on this concert and I am very proud of you! You touched the lives of so many people, and you are still loved more and more each day and we are still supporting you day by day. PS Selena: I am in love with that Purple bellbottom jumper you wore that night! I loved it!",1059091200,7,2004,4.584958217270195
1906217,5,B0000AINIZ,"I know the DVD is not out yet but I can't wait to get it when it does come out! There are so many people out there, like me, who have been waiting for years for it to be released.  I was really lucky to have been there the night of her last conert at the Astrodome.  Her performance that night was remarkable and when it was all over, Selena left me singing and dancing (literally AND in my heart) for a very long time.  Just to see her beautiful face again will be heartwarming.  I highly recommend this DVD to all of Selena's fans and even to those who had never even heard of her until her tragic death, this is one concert you will not be want to miss!",1058572800,9,656,3.984732824427481

1906226,5,B0000AINIZ,"When I first heard of the Singer Selena, I was living in Southern California. I did not even know who she was until that fateful day of her passing on March 31, 1995. Really sad. I began to look her up and see what she was all about. Wow, what a talented and beautiful woman this lady was. I immediately got her ""Crossover"" album, the one with several of her songs in English. Very good and highly recommended. I found this concert one day looking through some classic CDs at my nearby retailer. I thought, wow, I should check this one out. She was FANTASTIC! I watched this on an Ultra 4K Vizio 65"" TV and let me tell you, she came alive on the screen! It was like sitting in the front row. I could not help but think of her success that she had at that time and would have had. She is definitely mesmerizing to look at in every way. I really like her and miss her talent. This is a way to do it if you are a serious fan of hers, you need to get this.
The packaging of this is a JEWEL CASE, not a DVD case as you might think. I think it has to do with Marketing as music. But, you can easily get a blank DVD case if you prefer and discard the CD jewel case. Simple.
Anyway, I highly recommend!
Total Running time is about 55 minutes.
I wish it could have been longer though and her sister Suzette is not on Drums that night, apparently she was sick, I am guessing. The image quality and sound are really good though. =) Very happy with the purchase.",1451692800,2,1450,4.055749128919861

1906344,5,B0000AINIZ,"First let me compliment the seller. Not only was it shipped promptly but they took the time to write me a personal note of thanks for my purchase. I am old school and appreciated the polite touch,I am now going to see what else they offer. As far as the video itself I was pleased it is just the concert itself,none of the other things you get with the other $50.00 sets. But to me that is an advantage,I already own the movie Selena so I did not need anymore. The concert was one hour long and I once again fell in love with Selena her music and her band. The sound was very good the cinematography also good. We lost Selena just as she was starting to be an accepted American star--let us remember she had to learn Spanish she was an American kid with an amazing talent. In closing allow me to say--muchas gracias para todo estoy muy contento.",1356739200,3,845,4.254658385093168
1906345,5,B0000AINIZ,"i love this dvd u should buy it if u don,t have it she is really singing she played to sixty-four thousand fans on  that night i even saw her last concert live and it was such a great concert the voice fulled the rodeo",1344729600,,218,3.8444444444444446
1906346,1,B0000AINIZ,This dvd is way too expensive.  It's not worth it. Price is outrageous so I would not expect too many people buying your products if you continue to overprice them.,1324598400,,164,4.466666666666667
1906347,4,B0000AINIZ,"In addition to her unmatched vocal talent, Selena was also known for her energetic live performances. Energy and joy radiate from her in this concert DVD released 6 years after the show and her untimely death. Though this, her final STADIUM performance is not her actual final performance, it serves as a beautiful goodbye to a beloved superstar.

There are some nit-picky things that have made me remove a star from the DVD. There are some strange editing choices made here and there while the over-all show is not generally stylized which makes these feel even more unnecessary (the dramatized split-screen of Selena removing a clip-on earring after the first has flown off is one that especially comes to mind). While I feel the editor (Abraham Quintanilla, the singer's father) is trying to hi-light something with these affects it isn't quite clear what.

There is no interview-footage with Selena though there has been videos of it passed between fans for years. It would seem like an appropriate and wonderful addition to the video.

In a totally unexplainable choice a ""Making of"" video for the 1997 biopic was added into the special features. I have heard a lot of fans tear it down but I quite liked seeing the costume tests, screen tests, and interviews with the cast members...it just would have made more sense on a movie-DVD rather than in the special features of this concert. I supposed the justification for this was that a highly dramatized version of this concert was put into the film, other than that I don't see the connection.

Over-all the concert is extremely enjoyable and a wonderful showcase for Selena as a talented entertainer. Her performance of ""Como La Flor"" her signature song, is both joyous and heartbreaking to see as she smiles at the crowd and waves to the camera. It is eerie to know that mere weeks after that moment Selena would meet a tragic death. For that moment alone, I recommend this DVD. It is the only official full-concert release from Selena's many years of performing and is a treasure for any Selena's fan's vault.",1294876800,,2068,4.833333333333333
1906348,5,B0000AINIZ,"I love it! It's new. It looks, and sounds wonderful.
I received it with in the time(according to the shipping I payed for).
I give them 5 stars! Great Low price!",1293408000,,161,4.225806451612903
1906349,5,B0000AINIZ,"This is absolutely the best concert, Selena was an awesome performer, entertainer and sang live beautifully! Her Disco Medley was my favorite performance. She truly had it all she was the whole package.",1291420800,,202,5.151515151515151
1906350,5,B0000AINIZ,"This concert dvd gave me chill bumps, it is incredibly, ""awesome"". This is the real thing, the real Selena, entering the ""sold out"", 64,000 capacity crowd, in the Houston Astrodome. She enters the Astrodome, sitting in a carriage, pulled by horses, with horse riding escorts. She circles the Astrodome, the fans go crazy, shouting, ""Selena, Selena"". There are neon signs in the dome, lit up with ""Selena"",in bright lights. She is then lead to the stage, where her and her band perform what has become, one of the greatest, concerts in history, Selena's last concert, on February 26, 1995. This is a must-see concert.

I liked the Special Features, ""Selena: The Movie - All Access"", where it shows, behind the scenes, footage of the making of Selena, the Movie. I think this feature is the perfect gap, between, Selena's last concert, and Selena, the Movie. It's a perfect sequence, to lead up to the Movie.

I really cerish my dvd of the ""Queen of Tejano's"", last concert, and the bonus parts also. Thanks, and may God Bless the Quintanilla Family, and Chris Perez (Selena's widower)!!! Viva La Selena!!!! She will live on in our hearts forever!!!",1289088000,3,1147,4.846938775510204
1906351,5,B0000AINIZ,"My 5 star rating is for the concert.  Even though Selena was not at her best here, you can tell she was working her butt off despite the problems that were occurring behind the scenes.  Like another reviewer said, the extras from the movie should have been placed on the movie not this concert.  The concert should have included behind the scenes interviews of this concert and the fans.  Hopefully, one day EMI will re release this DVD with backstage footage not the movie.  The movie was ok, but everytime I see Jennifer Lopez as Selena in the movie, I really don't think ""Selena.""",1287446400,,583,4.5673076923076925
1906352,3,B0000AINIZ,"This concert was good because it was memorable and a final goodbye to Selena! However, it is outdated and a little corny. I ended up giving it to my sister and she loves it!",1286841600,,173,4.117647058823529
1906374,5,B0000AINIZ,"This is a great DVD for any Selena fans. Of course the rodeo performance is outstanding, but the DVD also has some interest insight into the preparation and production of the feature film about Selena's life. The DVD captures Selena's brilliant performance and her energy. It is Selena at her best!",1271980800,,298,4.862745098039215

1906376,5,B0000AINIZ,I bought this for my wife and she loved it. She is a huge Selena fan and this product added to her enthusiasm. Great product for any Selena fan.,1257033600,,144,4.0
1906377,5,B0000AINIZ,"I just saw it one night on Univision. I was so impress with her performance. Her dance moves and her outfit that goes so well together. She could dance so well in those boots. I really love her purple sequin outfit and the silver boots look so good on her. It just matches her skin complexion, her curvy body, and her hair color. She had all the elements of what a true stage performer has. I had mixed emotions while watching this...it made me happy and sad. Her smile made me miss her even more. She did had the nicest smile. I like the part when two of her back-up singers were dancing. You should have see the way they were moving. I enjoyed listening to all her songs...especially the ones in the 70s. I had so much fun watching her performed. I really wish I could still see her perform now. It was very special to me...especially at the end she was riding in a car, waving and smiling to all her fans. It must felt so good to be the one who's shining. She was truly a star. Selena did a really good job on her performance. Her singing and dancing abilities were awesome! I miss her so much. She was so special and talented. I would watch this concert again if I had the DVD.",1256342400,,1181,4.184210526315789
1906378,5,B0000AINIZ,I am a huge fan of Selena. Selena Live -Last Concert revealed her remarkable talent. It was also sad because it was her last concert. I wished her family would put out more DVD's. There is millions of Selena fans would purchase every concert.  The last concert was great..,1252972800,,272,4.551020408163265
1906379,5,B0000AINIZ,"""The Last Concert"" fully captures the magic and charisma of Selena at the zenith of her art as a singer, dancer, and interpreter, and of her renown as a beloved icon of her community.  By February, 1995, the time of the Astrodome spectacular it documents, Selena had achieved utter mastery of her singing and visual style, her sublimely graceful dancing, her rich, haunting mezzo-soprano, her fabled self-designed wardrobe, her incandescent natural beauty, her meticulous balance between sensuality and wholesome innocence, her legendary rapport with her audience and fans, and not the least, Spanish, her second language.  Her material here ranging from hard-driving disco (in English) to soulful ballads of broken love to fun ""get up and dance"" cumbia numbers, Selena's musical, emotional, artistic, stylistic and dramatic intelligence here beget a gripping, ebullient, lovable performance that will beguile and hold any sensitive heart forever.  Selena's dramatic range of -affekts-, facial expressions, vocal inflections, timing, dance and physical moves small and grand, all responsive to the words and emotions of the songs, are mesmerizing: one cannot turn one's eyes from this dazzlingly beautiful, captivating young woman radiating energy, joy, and charm at the top of her game.  Here we see Selena the completed, perfected world-class superstar who was just stepping onto the world stage when a month later tragedy struck.  The crowning jewel of her recorded and video legacy, ""The Last Concert"" merits a place among the most compelling live performances recorded by anyone ever.

All but the opening disco medley of the concert are Spanish-language songs. If you speak Spanish, have learned or want to learn some Spanish, or just grab the texts and translations of these songs from the web (where they are ubiquitous), just as with an opera, you will even more appreciate Selena's matchless art and subtlety as you follow her interpretations of this repertoire (mostly written for her by her brother, A. B. Quintanilla, and bandmate Pete Astudillo).  Knowledge of Spanish is not necessary to appreciate ""The Last Concert"", but it will vastly deepen your appreciation.

The single ""DVD extra"", the documentary on the making of the 1997 Jennifer Lopez (who cannot hold a candle to the real Selena on the latter's turf) movie by Greg Nava, is extremely interesting, but is just lagniappe to one of the most awe-inspiring and affecting live performances ever committed to video.  One can raise minor quibbles and could-be-better's with respect to the packaging, but they are inconsequential in the shadow of this preserved diadem.

This DVD is required for anyone at all a fan, or in the least interested in learning about the art and life, of the late Selena Quintanilla P&eacute;rez.

1906380,5,B0000AINIZ,"I never expected to enjoy this concert as much as I did.  This is a very high energy concert with Selena dancing and singing for around 50 minutes.  She never stops moving for the entire concert and it is never boring. I was worried when she came out singing in English at the start, but the remainder of the songs after the first medley are in Spanish.  I don't know much Spanish, but her singing is the best in Spanish, even though she does very well in English too.  Anyone who likes good popular music should enjoy this concert.  The DVD also has a nice feature that is quite interesting on the making of the movie about Selena's life.  I have seen the movie and it wasn't overly impressive, but this feature shows how much effort went into that movie and how much they tried to keep it as authentic as possible.  A really nice bonus would have been to include the movie too, make it a 2-volume set or even a 3-volume by including the CD soundtrack of the concert. In any case, this DVD is a must for Selena fans, but would easily be enjoyed by those who have never heard of Selena.  Very well filmed too for a live concert.",1229990400,,1128,4.262910798122066

J Lo may have tried, but if you are a die-hard Selena fan, no one will EVER suffice to represent Selena on film or stage.  The loss of this talented entertainer was felt hard and deep for a long, long time.  Selena was one-of-a kind!

In this tape, you will see a young professional, charismatic, talented, sincere and gifted entertainer in Selena Quintanilla.  She connected with the 40,000 fans who came out to see this young woman who could stir you with a cumbia or dazzle you with her outfits and that smile!!!!

1906390,5,B0000AINIZ,"I enjoyed this concert so much !!! Selena was amazing. I even loved the short ""extras"" included in the DVD about the ""Selena"" movie. My favorite and most fascinating bit there was the side-by-side comparison of Selena's moves and Jennifer Lopez's moves. It made me appreciate the hard work that was put into the movie to make it as authentic for the fans as possible and to keep the integrity of Selena's performances intact.

As far as this concert. Wow!!! She really made that stage her own and had a great interaction with the fans that night. She had great confidence and a love for her fans. How do I pick a favorite moment? Her upbeat songs were so much fun that it was not hard to imagine everyone up and dancing to the concert. Those were such great songs too. They really knew how to pick out material that could show off the song, Selena's vocals and the band's talent (her sister,Suzette, was not a part of this concert, she was out sick that night).
The slower songs were wonderful as well. Selena could really emote those lyrics and listening to her made me feel like she lived through what she was singing about. One of my favorite songs was (and still is) ""No Me Queda Mas"". That sort of sound with her voice like she was trying to hold back tears as she was singing was really heart-tugging. It made me feel like she was really emotionally wounded.
Songs like ""Cobarde"" and ""Si Una Vez"" showed a strong, womanly strength in her voice. It was a perfect fit.
And of course the fun, dance songs are classic Selena. She was just beginning to show what she could do with the ""Disco Medley"". Awesome. She would have effortlessly recorded all English-language albums with her unique style of music and topped the charts. ""Baila Esta Cumbia"",'Techno Cumbia"", ""La Carcacha"", ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"" are just fun to see her and the band cut loose and give so much of themselves to the crowd. I could tell that they truly enjoyed performing.
""El Chico Del Apt 512"" was really exiting too. How did she keep up such a vocally challenging song towards the end of the concert ? She smiled throughout and came through like a champ. How many other singers could pull that off? Not many. Especially with such a physically demanding concert.
Lots of singers now use recorded backup vocals to help them to cover for their own vocals while they are dancing and singing. Not Selena. It was all her. No fancy stuff. Just talent.
""Como La Flor"" was the showpiece. It was sung with lots of affection for her fans. It was that special signature song that would forever keep her in her fan's hearts. The lyrics of the song tell of someone who wishes someone well and for them find love somewhere else if it could not be with her. It reached people because she made it so genuine. It came from her own heart, from her own generous nature.
And her closing words... telling the fans to take good care and the hope to see them all soon and giving them thanks and all the credit for everything that they had given to her and the band is just enough to make me want to cry for the loss of such a giving and genuine human being like she was.
But somehow I think that it is the fans that keep her spirit alive and hopefully she will have inspired the young kids that she reached to become a bit like her. It would be a better world because of it. It would not be such a devastating loss that way. It is inspiring to see that she still reaches people who may not even speak Spanish, but to her, there were no borders and people were all good. This DVD brings it all back. She wanted to reach out to everyone and somehow she still does. It makes me happy to see that....",1141948800,38,3645,4.368188512518409

We all know that Selena was tragically murdered but it was a wonderful experience to see Selena perform on stage and give it her all in this great entertaining concert. We see Selena in all her beauty giving an unforgetable performance. With such style, grace, and great moves, she keeps us entertained from beginning to end. If you enjoyed the movie Selena and the soundtrack, many of those songs are performed in this exciting concert. We get to see her husband, Chris behind her playing his guitar even though her sister was unable to be there playing the drums due to a injury. I highly recommend this video to any Selena fan and fan of great Latino music. Excellent!!",1140652800,12,843,4.552631578947368

This is one concert I think everyone needs to see if they want to have a wonderful time with a limeless artist. You have all of the hits and the move are amazing. From start to finish this is the concert everyone needs to see. It show us how Selena light up the stage and how much love she had for her fans. She is a true artist who know how to work the crowd. She even has fun with her back up singers they all have fun for the crowd to see and I am just so glad I pick up this dvd when I did.

1906393,5,B0000AINIZ,"If you are a Selena fan, this is a must-see. The long-anticipated release of this DVD was well worth the wait. If you're a music aficionado and you're not especially familiar with her work, this DVD is a must-see for you as well! Everything in this release speaks to the bright and shining career that would have been hers, had her life not been horrifically cut short. Already a Latina icon and Grammy-winning artist at the time of her death, she no doubt would have become an unprecedentedly HUGE worldwide superstar -- the likes of which the entertainment industry has rarely, if ever, seen. Born in Texas, with English as her primary language, Selena learned to sing in Spanish beginning at the tender age of eight. She wanted to ""sing from her heart"" and to be true to her heritage. She most definitely attained those goals, and easily surpassed them. She was working on an English language crossover album at the time of her death, and had already recorded several songs, which were compiled into a special album (""Dreaming of You"") that skyrocketed up the charts immediately upon its release. Selena's talent was immeasurable, and her heart was at LEAST the size of Texas. If you've seen the movie of her life, you will be delighted with the section of this DVD that documents the making of the movie. Between that movie and this release of her final concert, you cannot help but to fall in love with her -- either for the first time or all over again. The abundance of her talent, in MANY areas, is overshadowed only by the love that filled her heart and encompassed her life. The world lost an absolute treasure when we lost Selena in 1995. If you watch this DVD, along with the movie of her life story, you will EASILY understand why.",1135036800,3,1744,4.610932475884244

1906396,5,B0000AINIZ,"I didn't come to hear (or appreciate) the music, artistry, charisma, beauty and purity of Selena Quintanilla-Perez until after her death in 1995, at the hands of her psychotic fan club president, Yolanda Saldivar.  Selena was a rising star, who remains in the hearts, souls and memories of many fans (Mexican, Anglo and Latin American alike).  There is a reason for that, and it is made evident in this DVD (which goes by WAY too quickly, by the way).

""Selena:  The Last Concert"" was originally recorded on February 26, 1995.  The beautiful Selena performed in front 64,000 devoted fans in the Houston Astrodome, mixing her old hits with some newer material.  This includes ""Disco Medley,"" an example of the contemporary pop influence that was part of Selena's style.  She was a real Donna Summer fan, when she first started singing with her brother and sister (two of her bandmembers who performed in Selena's band, Los Dinos), when she was only about nine years old.  For starters, Selena's vocals alone are amazing.  She has a huge voice, filled with expression and warmth.  Even though this is a recording, you really sense Selena's sincere connection to her audience, and almost as though she is singing to you, and you alone.  We also hear a cross section of her most popular cumbias (a very popular style of dance music in Mexico--hers is specifically referred to as ""tejano"").  This includes ""Amor Prohibido""  (translation:  ""Forbidden Love""--which is a biographical song about the relationship between her grandparents, who came from different social classes in Mexico), ""Baila Esta Cumbia,"" ""Tus Desprecios,"" ""Cobarde,"" ""Techno Cumbia,"" ""La Carcacha,"" ""Si Una Vez"" and ""Como La Flor"" (a song that was very popular in, both, the United States and Mexico).  We also hear ""No Me Queda Mas,"" originally written for her sister, Suzette.

What's more, this DVD also has an ""All Access"" feature, which follows the making of the movie, ""Selena.""  This was before ""JLo,"" when Jennifer Lopez was a young actress, and had yet to make her breakthrough role (which changed once

""Selena"" brought her to the forefront as a movie star).  It's both entertaining and informative.  We see all the work it took for Jennifer to truly capture the essence of this great legend.

Two big thumbs up......",1125792000,2,2291,4.992084432717678
1906397,4,B0000AINIZ,"This is a good video, although I get tired of people saying it was Selena's last performance before here untimely death, because it wasn't.

I attended this concert, and Selena did a great job, but I felt she was ill or something that night. I could see it in her face, and something was just not right with her. Don't get me wrong, she did a great job throughout her performance, but when she got off the stage, I though she was going to collaspe or something.

Univision has several live Selena performances that are much better than this DVD, but I am glad I added this DVD to my Selena collection, and would recommend it to others.

I first saw Selena perform in 1992. I didn't know who she was at the time, but I sure did after seeing her perform. Incredible talent with an extremely rare gift. I remember after Selena's performance, I turned to my friend, who was a big Selena fan, and said ""that kid can blow Gloria Estefan right off the stage, she's incredible."" I saw Selena perform 4 more times, including the month of her untimely death.

I will never understand how someone could shoot this wonderful individual in the back and kill her. If anybody deserves to be executed for their crime, it's Yolanda Saldivar. Too bad the legal system is screwed up and they could only give her life in prison.",1110844800,7,1308,4.460251046025105
1906398,5,B0000AINIZ,This is a great DVD! I love the concert now you could see what happened in the Astrodome instead of hearing it. It's so cool and Selena shines like a true star. Her music is great and the All Access: Selena: The Movie featturete is good too. I think any music fan and Selena fan will enjoy this concert. I highly recommend it.,1105228800,4,326,4.190476190476191
1906399,5,B0000AINIZ,"When you watch this performance, you cannot help but cry and regret that you were not there that night! Selena was saying goodbye to all her fans in the best way possible. I have seen many of her perfomances, and I think there is no other show as perfect as this one. She danced, moved, sang and enjoyed this night so bad and I know for sure, that, wherever she is, this is one of her most precious memories. Her fans made her feel the No. 1 singer ever, and she gave them her best. You can see how Selena could sing and dance at the same time and her voice was as perfect as it sound in any CD. She had the talent to interpret any songs and to put all her emotions into the performance. For a true Selena fan, this DVD must be a priority. Of course, if you can also get the cd, much better, because you can drive and have fun at the same time just listening to this ""reventon"" as she used to call it.

It is amazing how, just for the time the DVD lasts, you almost forget that she is not longer with us.....but, after all, is sadly how reality hits you in your face. She was a perfect entertainment. Rest in Peace my beloved Selena!",1102377600,2,1133,4.058035714285714
1906400,5,B0000AINIZ,"This is a must have for Selena fans. There is just some special affects that I think weren't nessesary. Like during ""Cobarde"" the slo-mo turning and at the end were Selena is fixing to end the show. They cut off what she says. But Selena states "" Y tambien munchas gracia a Emelio Navira y Grupo Rio. She gives thanks because she ""opened"" for Emilio. But I think the special affect during the Disco Medley. They split the screen in 3 different angles. And I think Selena's ear ring falls off and takes out the other and just throws it. But it is a must have for all Selena fans.",1094083200,,578,4.263636363636364
1906401,4,B0000AINIZ,"Watching this performance will have you smiling through your tears. Smiling, because Selena was obviously having so much fun, and tears because of the tragic and violent way in which her life was cut short. Selena was full of such exuberance, energy and JOY. Only the disco medley that begins the show is sung in English, but though I am not a Spanish speaker, I thouroughly enjoyed this concert. Selena was beautiful, had a great voice, and that gal could MOVE! As others have pointed out, the DVD suffers from less than perfect editing, but Selena herself makes it worth the price of admission.",1093305600,,596,4.740384615384615

Selena Live: The Last Concert was recorded in front of a record-breaking 65,000+ in the Houston Astrodome on February 27, 1995, a little over a month before her passing at the age of 23.  Definitely buy this, people, because you'll see why this Grammy-award winning performer was so loved and probably the world's most promising entertainer in music history.  Vive Selena!

ON STAGE. SHE WAS SO FLEXIBLE!, SO NATURAL!. SELENA DIDN'T NEED TO LEARN THE WAY THAT OTHERS SINGERS DO ON STAGE TODAY TO GET THE ATTENTION FROM THEIR FANS; HER NATURAL WAY TO BE ON STAGE WITH HER OWN MOVES AND UNIQUE DANCES BECAME HER TRADEMARK. IN THIS DVD YOU COULD SEE FOR YOURSELVES, SELENA HAD A VERY PARTICULAR WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER FANS ON STAGE AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC, YOU COULD SEE IT ON THIS DVD AS WELL....WHEN SHE WAVES TO THE CAMERA YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS SEEING ""YOU"" AS IF YOU WERE PART OF THAT CONCERT.

A young Tejana who overcame a world of prejudice to become one of the most revered and remembered Latinas of our lifetime.  This concert cries out for remembrance; Cries out for acceptance; Cries out for more!  More Selena, and plenty more!

Her vocals crystal clear and that teardrop her throat when she'd sing with such emotion. Selena I do believe was the first to start the Latin music revolution. I love Ricky Martin and his Grammy performance ushered in to the mass's a whole new era of music. BUT, what if Selena would have been able to perform on the Grammy's years before Ricky? Myself, I believe she would have made everyone take notice of Latin music much much earlier. This piece of music history shows Selena at her very finest. Vocally superb, charismatic beyond compare, and warmth from the heart. We lost one of the greatest singers when we lost Selena. And as a side note, much of what Jennifer Lopez started with clothing, perfume etc... Selena started first. I believe if Selena would have been alive today she very likely would have been where Jennifer is now musically because the talent Selena had was great. The DVD is a wonderful escape into ""her"" world where you just can't help but want more of Selena. Alas, this is all we have and what a great tribute.",1064016000,4,1149,4.609756097560975
1906417,5,B0000AINIZ,"This is by far one of the best dvd's and performance's ill ever see in my lifetime. Being a fan of Selena, I had been waiting on the last concert for so long and now that its here, its just emotional. I was disappointed because the concert ended cause you want it to go on forever. The besT!!!! A MUST HAVE!!!",1063411200,,309,4.081967213114754
1906418,5,B0000AINIZ,IT'S TOO BAD SUCH A TALENTED WOMAN IS GONE. SHE HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STAGE PERFORMANCE. I WAITED SO LONG TO SEE THIS CONCERT ON DVD. IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. IT WAS A GOOD PERFORMANCE THAT NIGHT BUT I COULD'NT HELP FEELING SAD. I WISH MORE OF HER CONCERTS WERE AVAILABLE TO WATCH. SHE WAS AN AMAZING PERFORMER. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH SELENA'S CONCERT TO SEE HER AMAZING TALENT. THIS SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN HER LAST BIG CONCERT. HER LAST CONCERT SHOULD STILL BE YEARS AWAY FROM TODAY.,1062892800,5,485,4.4
1906419,5,B0000AINIZ,I absolutely loved this DVD! Every second of it was great! To see the beautiful Selena singing and dancing and smiling with that beautiful smile was so awesome! She truly was and still is the best performer out there and i have to thank the Quintanilla family for sharing her story and her unique talent with all of her loyal fans out there. Thanks for keeping Selena's spirit alive! Anyone who is anyone should buy this DVD and add it to their collection. No collection is complete without the beautiful and talented Selena! I love you Selena!,1062806400,2,544,4.618556701030927

1906421,5,B0000AINIZ,"i had waited forever for the ""selena live-the last concert"" dvd and i must say that the wait was well worth it!!!! seeing the dvd gave me the opportunity to witness first hand what an incredibly gifted talent she was and why everybody loved her so much. i want to thank the quintanilla family for sharing this concert footage with everyone the world over and i'm sure that this was truly a labour of love. also, i would like to congratulate jennifer lopez on her stunning portrayal of selena. while looking at the making of the movie, i couldn't tell where the real selena ended and where jennifer began--it made me realize that nobody could've brought selena to life the way that you did--you truly are a gifted actress. thanks again quintanilla family for sharing selena's incredible talent with the world and to selena, god bless you, you are truly missed & will be forever!!!",1062460800,5,879,4.67741935483871

7997244,5,B0000AINIZ,"This is outstanding!! All of her fans should own it. I have watched it many times. She was an incredible performer and had the best female voice in Tejano music.

She will always be with us via her wonderful gift of music from all her cds and concert performances.

Her band was a close-knit group of family and friends. Chris Perez, the lead guitarist, is her husband. I chose to mention Chris in the here and now as he considers Selena his wife and always will.",1499472000,,463,4.372093023255814
