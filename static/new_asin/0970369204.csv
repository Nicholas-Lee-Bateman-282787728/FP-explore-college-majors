7794173,5,0970369204,"Julia ""Butterfly"" Hill has become a much-admired figurehead for the environmental movement. This film attempts to show what her life was like during her tree-sit, and takes the time to collect input from a variety of sources, including many of Hill's detractors. Wolens spent quite a lot of time in Luna with Hill and has captured some incredible footage and interviews of her stay in the tree. This film will haunt you long after you've seen it.",972432000,3,446,4.805194805194805
