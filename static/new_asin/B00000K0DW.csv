THE FILM - [ 3.5 / 5 ]:

Fritz Haarmann, aka the Butcher of Hanover and the Vampire of Hanover, was a German serial killer responsible for the murders of two dozen boys and young men during the so-called years of crisis between the wars. His case would partly inspire Fritz Langs M, and its central character portrayed by Peter Lorre, as well as this forgotten gem from 1973.

""Tenderness of the Wolves"" treats the viewer to a few weeks in the company of a killer. Baby-faced and shaven-headed, in a manner that recalls both M and F.W. Murnaus ""Nosferatu,"" Haarmann is a fascinating, repulsive figure. Using his status as a police informant to procure his victims, he dismembers their bodies after death and sells the flesh to restaurants, dumping the remainder out of sight. This isn't an easy film to watch, but it certainly gets under the skin

Produced by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (who also supplies a shifty cameo), Tenderness of the Wolves provided two of his regular actors with a means of expanding their careers. Ulli Lommel, later responsible for the infamous video nasty ""The Boogeyman,"" made his directorial debut, while Kurt Raab wrote the screenplay as well as delivering an astonishing performance as Haarmann.

This film is most definitely not for everyone. It has some strong subject matter and a fair bit of male frontal nudity, for those wondering. As director of photography Jrgen Jrges mentions in his interview included on this Blu-ray about the film being very simple and clear and focused due to its tiny budget, I think that is why the film works as well as it does and what I like about it. Sometimes it's not so much what Fritz says with his words, but what he says with his eyes and expressions. ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" was beautifully filmed by Jrgen Jrges, whether it is interior or exterior shots. The blood effects in the film had a realistic look to them and in one instance, I believe the first victim shown, the practical effect looked perfect with the blood pumping from the open wound.

AUDIO - [ 4 / 5 ]:

""Tenderness of the Wolves"" comes with a German LPCM Mono audio track. Optional English subtitles are also included. I thought the audio track sounded excellent. The dialogue was crisp and clear. The score, sound effects and dialogue were well balanced throughout the film. I did not detect any problems with the audio in the form of hissing, pops or dropouts.

VIDEO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""Tenderness of the Wolves"" comes to Blu-ray thanks to Arrow Video in a dual Region A and B release. The film has received a brand new high definition transfer and is presented in 1080p with a 1.78:1 Aspect Ratio. First things first, the video quality is terrific. The film has a sort of drab look when it comes to colors, which perfectly fits for the time that the film takes place. I love the use of black and white in the film and the contrast on the Blu-ray makes the difference even more striking. Also, the subdued colors seem to stand out more in the film since they are often surrounded by so much black, white and gray whether it be the characters clothing or the dreary background. To me, it all looks great. I thought the black levels looked incredible as well and really stood out in our villains clothing among other things. Skin tones looked fine, even Fritz with his pale complexion. There was a fair amount of fine detail present and there was a thin layer of grain throughout with it only becoming mildly heavier in some of the darker scenes.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

Introduction by director Ulli Lommel - You have the option when playing the film, to first watch a brief introduction by the director.

Audio Commentary - This track features director Ulli Lommel and moderator Uwe Huber. Mr. Lommel does a good job of both describing what is happening on the screen and providing behind the scenes information. Members of the cast and crew are discussed with a fair amount of time being spent on writer and star Kurt Raab and also producer and star Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The killer that this film is based upon is also discussed in this commentary. This was both informative and interesting, so if you enjoyed the film and would to learn more about those involved with the film or just the story itself, I would suggest listening to this track.

The Tender Wolf (25:05) - Director Ulli Lommel discusses making the film as well as how the movie was received by those that watched it. Mr. Lommel covers a range of topics from how the film came to be, filming locations and his other films like ""The Boogey Man."" Ulli Lommel provides a significant amount of information in this interview.

Photographing Fritz (24:24) - Director of photography Jrgen Jrges discusses working on ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" and the love-hate relationship of Kurt Raab and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. A good glimpse of the tension behind the scenes. Mr. Jrges speaks about the shooting locations including how they tried to avoid moving around in order to save time and money so they tried their best to find several locations in close proximity. (In German with English subtitles)

Haarmann's Victim Talks (16:07) - An interview with actor Rainer Will (Opfer) who discusses working with Kurt Raab, Ulli Lommel and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He talks about working with Ulli Lommel again in a no budget film, ""Wachtmeister Rahn."" Mr. Will speaks fondly of  his experiences working with Ulli Lommel. He also talks about how later in his career he worked with Fassbinder on a number of films. (In German with English subtitles)

An Appreciation by Stephen Thrower (41:14) - Film historian Stephen Thrower discusses a number of areas regarding ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" including cast and crew members Ulli Lommel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Margit Carstensen. He also covers the relationship between the characters of Fritz and his boyfriend in the film as well as their real life counterparts. A very thorough interview that should answer most questions you may still have regarding the film. One odd thing of note is around the five minute mark, the section where you would tie a tie, has what seems to be green screen bleeding through a bit. It becomes more obvious later on but thankfully it doesn't go beyond that or ruin the interview.

IN CONCLUSION:

Again, ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" is not a film for everyone and isn't even an acquired taste. The subject matter is sure to keep some from giving it a chance and of course, to each their own. This was my first time viewing the movie and I found it to be a good film. I really liked the look of the film. The Blu-ray is loaded with almost two hours of interviews plus other extras. The film looks amazing and sounds excellent as well. Whether you enjoy the film or not is up to you, but the Blu-ray is definitely another high quality release by Arrow Video.

1239692,4,B00000K0DW,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

In an age where heinous atrocities appear in news headlines every day, society has almost become desensitized to just how sick and depraved people can be.  But almost a century ago, before the news media had perpetual outlets through which to bombard the public with tragedy, truly shocking news could stun a crowd into silence.  I imagine this is how many people reacted when hearing of the crimes committed by Fritz Haarmann, a serial killer in Germany responsible for raping, killing, and cannibalizing dozens of young men in between World War I and World War II.  Whereas we have seen many news stories like this over the past three or four decades, back in those days, such things were practically unheard of.

This is best kept in mind when viewing Ulli Lommels TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES, a brief but graphic depiction of Haarmanns life a few weeks prior to his arrest.  Obviously, the world was a much different place back in that time period, but the crimes he committed were unthinkable.  As such, this chilling portrait of one mans perversion is a haunting trek into history.

I would wager many viewers will look at some of the characters in this film as being stupidly naive.  But again, take the time period in which this is set (the film actually takes place after World War II, but the actual events occurred in between the two great wars).  People just didn't consider such brutality could happen near or around them.  I suppose many of us think the same way today, however news reports seem to pop up daily to state otherwise.

TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES is shot decently and looks pretty good onscreen.  You can definitely tell the film is dated, but for good reason:  it IS over 40 years old.  The HD transfer looks great, however, and the updated sound is a huge upgrade from previous versions.

The acting is very good, with Kurt Raab giving a phenomenal performance as Haarmann.  Raab looks very harmless, and yet he exudes a creepy vibe that will haunt you long after the movie ends.  I daresay nobody else could have portrayed the killer in such a convincing fashion.

Surprisingly, the film does not have many special effects, but this doesnt detract from it in the least.  There are a few scenes involving blood, and it looks realisticparticularly when it is spurting from a gaping neck wound at one point.  This effect looks amazing, and I immediately wondered how the effects team pulled it off.

The story in TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES is pretty slow to start off, with much of the buildup making little sense.  The sequence of events seems disjointed at first, and I wasn't sure what I was watching.  But then, about 45 minutes in to the film, things start to click.  When Haarmanns true nature is revealed, many previous scenes start to make more sense.  As this happened, a chill crept down my spine; I understood why the film had been made this way, and the effect was terrifying.  This startling realization made the film much more intense, and therefore an excellent viewing experience.

TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES is a big win for me, and I recommend it.  Be warned, however: some of it is difficult to watch.  In addition to a couple of grisly killings, there are also several scenes of male nudity, so you might want to keep the little ones out of the room if they have a habit of wandering in.  But if you're a fan of horror, particularly the kind based on real life, then make a note to pick this one up soon.  It is available now.",1447200000,,3537,4.600638977635783

1239694,5,B00000K0DW,"""Tenderness of the Wolves"" is a superbly crafted tale of demented horror from German director Ulli Lommel (the classic ""Boogeyman"" and the modern ""Zodiac Killer"").  Beautifully filmed in Germany, this is the true life account of serial killer Fritz Haarman; after World War I, he lured impoverished boys and young men to his apartment where he had sex with them before killing them.  A forerunner of Jeffrey Dahmer, Haarman would later chop them up and sell their tender flesh to a local restaurant.  Because of budget constraints, the setting of ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" is post world War II.

  This film is not as violent or bloody as I was led to believe by the warning on the DVD jacket.  Much was left to the imagination.  The victims are not shown being cut into pieces.  The most disturbing scene is when the police, knowing Haarman was a pedophile, hired him to patrol the train stations where he had ready access to his prey.  Also, his perverted friends overlooked Haarman's dark secret.  Kurt Raab, an openly homosexual actor who later died of AIDS complications, gives a believable portrayal of the charming, but deceitful Haarman.

  Anchor Bay Entertainment has given us an excellent presentation of ""Tenderness of the Wolves.""  It has a widescreen aspect ratio of 1.66:1.  The audio and video are nearly flawless.  An excellent theatrical trailer, talent bios, and an audio commentary with Lommel have all been provided.  The audio is German with yellow, easy-to-read English subtitles.  Since I am a big fan of foreign horror films such as Italian gialli (murder mysteries), I have grown accustomed to watching subtitles.

  ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" is highly recommended for those who are intrigued by famous, real life serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, John Gacy and Ted Bundy.  Lommel seems obsessed with serial killers since he has directed numerous movies involving them such as ""Son of Sam,"" ""Green River Killer"" and ""B.T.K. Killer.""",1245974400,2,1965,5.03416149068323
1239695,4,B00000K0DW,"In post World War I in Germany, Fritz Haarmann was/is known as the Butcher of Hanover. This is a historical fact.

The Tenderness of Wolves shows us just how this monster actually operated. Director Ulli Lommel, his hand guided by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, provides us with a truly disturbing film.

Kurt Raab as Haarmann actually appears to be playing Peter Lorre playing Haarmann in the (far superior) M. Raab seems, at times, to be channelling Lorre.

The plot is not entirely cohesive and it cannot withstand itself through the middle. However, the beginning and ending of this film far make up for the deficit of the middle.

Haarman lured young children away from desolate life with a promise of a hot meal and warm place to sleep. Instead he offered them rape, murder, mutilation, and eventually cannibalism.

This is an arthouse film masquerading as a horror/thriller/drama. It is definitely worth your time, but it is not for the faint of heart.

A good film.",1131580800,3,968,4.871951219512195
1239696,5,B00000K0DW,"Kurt Raab, as Fritz Haarmann, brings sympathy and charm to an otherwise depraved and wretched human being. In Raab's performance we recognize not only the dark side of life and 'humanity,' we stare eyeball to meatball in that inescapable and horrible truth behind every human's existence; that fundamentally we are flesh eaters made of the same blood, meat and guts as all the other species who rip flesh from bone and devour the remains of dead animals in order to survive.

This film doesn't hide from those awful truths about man's bloody flesh ripping, drooling nature always ready to chow down on some carnivorous carcass in order to satisfy his tummy's every growl, and survive in this dog eat dog world of sanitized and civilized delights sizzling behind neon lights on seafood platters brimming with buttered and lemon fillets and scrumptiously grilled porter house steaks.

Some of the most beautiful men are used to represent Haarmann's victims. One young man especially stands out, the sensuous, handsome piano player who becomes central to the film's horrific/esthetic paradox; once so lovely and desirable, and then so easily and quickly reduced to a steakburger for some unsuspecting lover of juicy, dripping steaks, instead of that vital and desirable young piano player who only hours before played the piano, the type one would pay handsomely to have for the night.

Now that young piano player slithers and slides through the warm intestines of some average Joe or Jane who so hungrily gobbled his grilled or roasted remains with some wine and conversation over a scrumptious meat and potatoes dinner. And this is the awful truth, we, humans, are indistinguishably  reduced to food and waste like any other animal, fish or bird who has been tenderly and lovingly marinated then served in the sizzling aroma and juices of a roasting pan, tempting and teasing its unsuspecting guests now salivating in the splash and wag of their anticipating tongues.

The horrific fate and truths behind the day to day survival of every living creature is unmasked. This film is not just about cannibalism and the grizzly delectable delights we devour every night, it is about how we view living creatures as our dinner until we discover that it is 'we' who may be the slab of meat sauteing in the roasting pan. How differently we now view a pound or two of prime rib when it's one of our own.

Truly an important and horrific and esthetic film.",1098835200,8,2446,4.924757281553398
1239697,4,B00000K0DW,"Tenderness of the Wolves (Ulli Lommel, 1973)
Produced by the legendary Rainer Werner Fassbinder (Gods of the Plague, Chinese Roulette, etc.) and written by lead actor Kurt Raab, Ulli Lommel's Tenderness of the Wolves has emblazoned on its box ""inspired by Fritz Lang's M."" Yeah, in the same way John Carpenter's The Thing was inspired by Christian Nyby's version. In both cases, the later crew went back to the original source material to create something more faithful than the first film. M is great filmmaking, and it would be hard to categorize Tenderness of the Wolves as a clear improvement over M, but it's certainly closer to the original story.
Raab (The Magic Mountain, Bitter Harvest) is Fritz Haarmann, the Werewolf of Hanover (as he was popularly known). Haarman's MO was to pick up runaway teen boys at the train station, take them back to his room, kill them, and sell them to the unsuspecting population of Dusseldorf as grade-A pork. Amusingly, during the time he committed most of his murders (those, at least, which authorities verified were his handiwork), he was also a police informant, and used his connections to the authorities as part of his pickup line. None of this was present in M; all of it at least makes an appearance in Tenderness.
The movie is carried, for the most part, by Raab's performance. The man is, quite simply, creepy looking. Lommel (The Blank Generation) uses Raab's creepiness to maximum effect, to the extent of deprecating the other major players in the film (Haarmann's accomplice, Hans Grans, gets about a quarter the screen time he probably should, from all accounts). Staying focused on Haarmann and his activities most of the time gives the film a clarity which it might not have otherwise had, and has been lacking in many of Lommel's later horror flicks. Everything comes together quite nicely, and aside from the nits serial killer groupies are going to pick (e.g., the lack of mention of the infamous ""head behind the stove""), it works quite well.
One of Lommel's best films, and a must-see for fans of the serial killer genre. *** 1/2",1080691200,5,2094,4.868347338935574

TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES is not a very easy film to watch. There is very little in terms of sheer horror or violence, but the movie shows very graphic homosexual scenes & overtones.

7913966,4,B00000K0DW,"Based on the true story of Fritz Haarman who was a serial killer who preyed on young men and boys between the wars, this is a repositioning of the time line to be just after World War II in a devastated Germany. He was a man who had come under the watch of the Police but they chose to keep him as informant rather than look into his more nefarious habits.

He sells meat on the black market and his visits are eagerly awaited by his customers. At night he patrols the local train station and helps out waifs and strays  some of them he takes under his wing and brings them back to his attic room. There the neighbours start to complain about the ungodly noises that emanate from the loft long into the wee hours of the German night.

Now this is deeply chilling and has scenes that will stay with you. The nasty bits are far from gratuitous but they have more of an impact because of that. Openly gay he lusts after Hans who is the German equivalent of a Spiv and equally as loathsome. The lighting is just brilliant too, adding to the eerie atmosphere and the squalid detritus of post war life. Rainer Werner Fassbinder puts in an on screen appearance too  which is just cinematic gravy as far as I am concerned. The actual transfer by Arrow Video is really high quality too and it feels as if this could have been made a few years ago and not in 1973 as indeed it was.

7913968,3,B00000K0DW,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

One thing I try to strive for is to watch as many movies from as wide a variety of sources and styles as possible. In doing so I might not like all of them but at least Ive left myself open to seeing things outside of my comfort zone and exposed myself to things I might miss that are great and some that are the worst things imaginable. As movie loves I think we all need to do this and then let others know what we think. The bad thing is that those that disagree, those that think were stupid for not getting what is great about a film or those that think were stupid for enjoying something they think of as drek feel the need to be upset with your feelings on something they love or hate. What they miss is the fact that the opportunity was there to see something that might not be available in the first place and that by being discussed is brought to the attention of many who might not know it even exists.

Ive spoken often in my reviews of Arrow Video. I think they are among the top five companies right now (perhaps even higher) when it comes to releasing hard to find films, obscure films, classic films, art films and movies in general that are more likely than not to be passed over by the major studios. Not only do they do a fantastic job of this, they offer their titles in the best possible formats, include outstanding extras whenever possible and do so at a price that is reasonable (sorry Criterion, you charge far too much for what you deliver). I may not always love the movies they release but I do appreciate all of the efforts they go through to deliver to those that do.

With that in mind I just watched TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES, a 1973 movie directed by UIli Lommell. Lommell was a protg of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and a part of the New German Cinema movement that ran during the early 70s. His career has gone up and down and hes delivered fairly mainstream films like THE BOOGEYMAN as well as several films that could be called art films before finally making his way to made for DVD movies that haven't fared that well. But there is always the possibility of his rising once more.

TENDERNESS focuses on the true story of Fritz Haarmann, a German serial killer who did most of his nefarious deeds right after WWI. As played by Kurt Raab, Haarmann comes off as one of the most chilling murderers seen on screen. An uncloseted homosexual who preyed on young boys that he then murdered, Haarmann then went on to cut up his victims and sell their bodies as meat to friends who were in need of fresh meat. While that alone might make for a terrifying killer there is more behind the man to make him even more horrific.

Raab plays Haarmann as a slightly shy yet smooth talking con man who convinces friends to ignore his odd behavior from time to time. Not only does he get them to ignore it, he talks his way out of an arrest by offering his services to the local police in helping them ferret out other criminals. With a fake badge in pocket he uses his influence to not only pass along information about his criminal competition, he also uses it to persuade young runaway boys to his apartment where he beds and then kills them. Raab has chosen a bald headed look that at times reminds us of Max Schreck as Nosferatu, a good comparison as Haarmann was also known as the vampire of Hanover due to his biting some of his victims on the neck.

The movie takes on an odd feel for a number of reasons besides the pedophilic serial killer at the center of it all. The people Haarmann associates with may belong to the lower criminal class but they are also seen as struggling to survive after their country has been beaten in war. There is a certain amount of sympathy to be felt for them and Lommell depicts that in subtle ways. The movie also has a bombed out feel in its of settings and style of being filmed. The filmed world of Haarmann is a grey one lacking of color and life, much as that Germany would have been at the time. The few glimpses of color involve either his associations in a local bar or during the murder sequences.

The life and times of Haarmann are seen here in the latter part of his life rather than attempting to cover his entire career. In the end the number of murders he committed with his lover Hans Grans has been listed as anywhere between 24 and 50 people. That many are not seen here. He isn't depicted as a raging lunatic but as I stated earlier, as a subtle and manipulative sort that isn't seen killing in the most brutal fashion of some movie killers but still in perhaps some of the most twisted ways.

For a film coming out of the seventies it offers more full frontal nudity than most as well as touching on homosexuality that was still fairly taboo at the time. It doesnt condone or condemn the topic but instead uses it to develop its central character. If you find this offensive then the movie will do just that. I mention it so that those who might be are aware.

In the end the movie is one I may have to watch a second time to fully understand or appreciate. While the story itself is interesting (enough so that another more famous movie, M, was based on this same tale), I found the pacing of the film to be slow and in trying to keep up with the translation of dialogue with what I was watching made me unable to fully appreciate what was on the screen at times. As a single viewing experience it was just so so for me. Perhaps my opinion will change the second time around. What I did find was an experience of watching a film from another country that didn't fit the Hollywood mold. That doesnt make it a good experience, just a different one.

For the average viewer Im not sure I would suggest watching this. For foreign film fans you will love it. For fans of Lommell and Fassbinder I have little doubt you will add it to your collection. For me, on the whole, it was interesting but nothing stupendous.

7913969,4,B00000K0DW,"Before he was reduced to helming a never-ending series of terribly-shot true crime flicks for direct-to-video distribution, Ulli Lommel displayed great promise as a filmmaker with 1973s Tenderness of the Wolves, a chilling character study and realistic horror tale produced by world cinema legend Rainer Werner Fassbinder that makes its debut on Blu-ray in the U.S. and U.K. courtesy of Arrow Video.

In the years following World War I in the German town of Hanover, petty criminal and con artist Fritz Haarmann (Kurt Raab, who also penned the screenplay) devoted his depraved energy to stalking and murdering many young boys and men. After killing his victims, he would devour some of their flesh and sell the rest to appreciative local restauranteurs who had no idea where these choice cuts of meat originated. When the police arrest Haarmann for a laundry list of crimes including assault and soliciting sex from minors, they offer to release him and drop the charges in exchange for becoming one of their informants. Empowered by his new status with the law, Haarmann intensifies his efforts to hunt and kill a growing of number of fresh victims he finds wandering the streets or hanging around in train stations. He entices them back to his apartment with the promise of food and work, seduces them into bed, and then proceeds to gnaw holes in their jugular before finishing the job and savoring the remains.

There are two things I can look forward to when checking out an Arrow Video Blu-ray release. One is that the package is going to be fantastic, the features will be plentiful and the overall value will be extremely high. The other thing and this is the main problem, I can never quite know whether I'll like the movie or not. Tenderness of the Wolves looked like it was going to be a good movie. I enjoy flicks that are based on a real life serial killers, so I figured this was going to be a great movie to check out. Unfortunately, my tastes are definitely not in the same ballpark as this film. To me, it was slow, boring and uneventful. Also, way too much teenage male nudity for me.

MOVIE

Tenderness of the Wolves is based on the life of Fritz Haarmann, known as both the Butcher of Hanover and the Vampire of Hanover. After reading his life story on Wikipedia, I know see that the movie does follow fairly close to what happened back then, which is incredibly dark and disturbing (if you like to know more, check out the wiki page). I do have to give points to the movie trying very hard to properly convey what may or may not have happened back then, however, even with saying that, I still didn't enjoy the movie.

The flick moves along at a snail's pace, barely linking scenes together, as we follow several days in the life of killer Fritz Haarmann, a man of peculiar tastes. Due to his background in criminal activity, he becomes a police informer and this allows him to ""arrest"" young boys and take them back to his home, where he feeds them and then proceeds to bite into their necks and kill them. All his friends are pretty much aware of what he does, but they don't seem to really care one way or another. It just didn't seem that realistic to me to see all these oblivious individuals just hanging around Fritz and not giving a damn as to what he does or where that special meat comes from. The only person who takes any interest in what he is doing is one of the women who lives in the same apartment building, and that's only because she sees him hauling something wrapped in a bloody sheet and thrown in the river. Do the police believe her? Not really. It's incompetence set on high and if this is really what happened back then, dear god, I'm amazed they ever caught him.

To some people, Tenderness of the Wolves is going to be a good movie and I see no problem in that. The acting by Kurt Raab is fantastic, as he hits all the right notes in conveying a pretty boy, who looks like the friendliest man on the block, but no amount of stellar acting saved me from being bored. In the end, it just didn't tickle my fancy.

BLU-RAY

Spite not liking the movie, the Blu-ray from Arrow Video is top shelf quality all around. The video is crisp and clean and the audio is loud and clear. I have no complaints on the presentation with this flick and I can't see why anyone else would either. As for the special features, the hits keep on coming, as the disc is full of interviews and a wonderful booklet featuring plenty of new information on the film. I mean, just look at that list below and see what I'm talking about. You'll be busy for quite a while and for any fans of the film, this is a must buy for the features alone.

VERDICT

Tenderness of the Wolves was not my type of movie, as I felt it was a tad too boring and distasteful. However, for fans of the flick, which I'm sure there are plenty of, the Blu-ray from Arrow Video is a must buy and worth the ticket price.",1448496000,3,4943,4.6731875719217495
7913971,4,B00000K0DW,"Hard to believe this instant classic is by the same man who has plagued the true crime fan for a number of years now with a series of amateur (that's being kind) shot on video docudramas supposedly based off of famous serial murders. This film is so far removed from that homemade junk its unfathomable and shameful. Lommel is a visionary here. The commentary clearly places a lot of credit on Kurt Raab's obsessive interest in Haarman. But even though the film twists a lot of the facts Raab's performance is so hypnotic; he's more like Peter Lorre in ""M"" than any factual material available I've come across on Haarman. Anyone interested in the real Fritz Haarman would do themselves a favor to track down ""The Deathmaker"" for another stunning one man performance.

Everything is spot-on in this film. Cinematography, lighting, sets (the use of real locales is excellent), acting, even background players... if I hadn't known who directed this I would have guessed Fassbinder hands down. It reeks of him, in the same manner a Paul Morrissey film can easily be recognized. Perhaps Lommel was trying to impress Fassbinder. Now at 70, it would be so great if Lommel quit this crap he's been churning out and return to his roots and I don't mean ""Boogeyman"".... but even that would be an improvement.",1448236800,,1298,4.794642857142857
