8094086,2,B000BY42ZE,Returned.  Just couldn't follow it quick enough by myself.,1442620800,,58,5.444444444444445
8094087,5,B000BY42ZE,"I rated ""The Genius of Flexibility Video""  high because it teaches you the value and understanding of stretching and strengthening the body with benefit to mind and spirit.

8094088,1,B000BY42ZE,"The review of the exercises is fine, although the audio is spotty and the editing needed work. The actual 20 minute workout is a joke. It is impossible to do the stretches and watch your TV at the same time, yet there is no audio component, so you do the stretches in silence! No way to know how many repetitions to do or how long each stretch should last.

This was slapped together by total amateurs. Don't buy it!",1221004800,3,416,4.265822784810126
8094089,4,B000BY42ZE,"I noticed there were a lot of complaints about the production quality on this DVD.But I think it adequately performs the job it was created for: real time demonstrations of the level ""1"" meridian stretching routines described in Cooley's book. In fact, I think the actual selection of exercises for the ""Level 1"" routine is a bit better than those in the book (a couple of the tougher ones have been replaced with level ""2"" exercises that actually seem easier - to me - to perform.)

Yes, this is a very bare bones DVD, but it certainly is inexpensive and has enough worthwhile material to be worth getting - IF you like the ocncept of ""resistance/meridian"" stretching and if you liked the book version of ""The Genius Of Flexibility"" and want to see the exercise s performed with live models. But again, I wouldn't recommend the DVD by itself - it is unlikely to convince anyone who isn't already enthusiastic about the concepts in the book.",1193961600,10,941,4.668674698795181
8094090,1,B000BY42ZE,"Appallingly bad presentation, awful delivery, terrible audio.  Cooley jumps back and
forth from the frame looking disheveled and confused and lets his students give the same set of
instructions  Muscles are not referred to by names.  I would laugh instead except I wasted
my money.  Maybe his system has merit but I wouldn't know it from watching this mess.",1185408000,4,357,5.0
8094091,1,B000BY42ZE,"I bought this DVD after I read the book of the same title, expecting clarity and helpful hints in order to be able to use the author's principles to advantage.  Instead, I got a DVD  so poorly made that it negated every principle put forth in the book.  The audio was abominable and terribly noisy.  The actual directions were unnecessarily repetitive, and sometimes unintelligible.  Mr. Cooley jumping in and out his minimal set was only distracting and not informative.  If I could have given this product a 0 I would have.  Mr. Cooley's genius was nowhere in sight.",1185321600,2,568,4.73469387755102
8094092,4,B000BY42ZE,"The video wasn't put together with a huge production crew,  but the pictures, motions, and ideas are clearly presented.  I have been useing the system for 6 weeks now and my acne has cleared up and i am finally gaining weight that i have been trying ot do for the past 9 years.  And my Ligaments and tendons in my shoulders have been tightening them selves up and no longer dislocate thanks to this brilliant system.",1159920000,6,416,4.447368421052632
8094093,1,B000BY42ZE,"Probably the worst produced video I have ever seen. It was jaw-dropping, harshly bad. So bad, it was hard to see that the concepts bear consideration. I would like to hear the comments of a seasoned yoga teacher on the wisdom of resistance stretching. It does seem to work, but the strain on some ligaments may not be advisable. Other systems use similar techniques; Russian bodibuilders have developed a resistance stretching technique, and in yoga many backbends involve resistance with stretching.",1158537600,3,500,5.185185185185185
