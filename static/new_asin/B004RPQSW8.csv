4460930,4,B004RPQSW8,"Far from being a good film. This remains a pretty good B feature. Benefiting from it's period and urban setting. With terrific black and white photograpy and a solid cast.
If you like fifties crime flicks you should enjoy this one.",1339718400,5,231,4.658536585365853
4460931,5,B004RPQSW8,"Nice movie- for the periode- based on the novel by Ed McBain.
First story of the 87th Precinct.
Lots of good and wonderful books to follow.
And some of the fine movies based on those books.",1311552000,5,189,4.277777777777778

4460933,4,B004RPQSW8,"I enjoyed the movie a great deal.  It was either the first or one of the first movies that Jerry Orbach was in.  That is of course Lenny from Law and Order.  A great actor. His role was that of the gang leader.
The movie had some fairly racy scenes for 1958.  A lot of movies at that time didn't show women dressed as scantily as some were in this movie.  But very tame by today's standards.  And lastly there is a great twist at the end.  For a simple movie it was very entertaining.",1443484800,,484,4.031578947368421

4460935,4,B004RPQSW8,"Not the greatest Cop show ever but it is good enough to buy. It was filmed in 1958 and it deals with city crime and the tensions between cops and their wives.  There is one cops wife who is played by Shirly Ballard and is a stunning knockout but not in the Marilyn Monroe image. Shirly Ballard is a looker and has a great body on her....especially her legs!  It was filmed in 1958, in black and white, but still a good film.",1438819200,,424,4.096385542168675

4460938,4,B004RPQSW8,This movie contained a good performance from Robet Loggia and included several other stars we would see more of later. Overall a good gritty cop story on a low budget.,1409616000,,167,4.6
4460939,5,B004RPQSW8,"I like these old films for their originality and good acting. This site is a breath of fresh air, most have had enough of the reality shows and new bad films.",1397433600,,158,4.129032258064516
4460940,4,B004RPQSW8,"Though not a good as the TV show, Robert Loggia is a good Steve Corella. The other actors are pretty bad or the director was out of his element. Ed McBain tells a good story.",1355529600,,174,4.0
4460941,5,B004RPQSW8,"This is a great movie.  A very young Robert Loggia.  The detective story here is good and not predictable.  The sound and picture look great.

8439125,3,B004RPQSW8,"Movie version of the 87th Precinct book series ""Cop Hater"" by Ed McBain. Strictly B level production. Corny dialogue, lackluster stereotypical performances, not as good as the book. I gave it a 3 star in-between rating. It's no ""Detective Story"", ""Madigan"", etc. Compared to them it's 1 star. But fans of NYPD cop movies, film noir, EdMcBain 87th Precinct, etc. it might be 5 star. Viewing on this one will be in the eye of the beholder.",1483315200,,437,4.688311688311688
8439126,2,B004RPQSW8,"This is based on an Ed McBain 87th Precinct novel. I love that series and have read them all. It gets one of its two stars by being McBain-based; the film was pretty dreadful. Despite some good casting, the detectives of the 8-7 were flat and lifeless. For some reason, the lead character - whom McBain named Steve Carella - was here called Steve Carelli, which sounded very strange to someone who's read all 50+ novels in the series.
My concise review would be: ""That's done. I don't have to watch it again!""",1481846400,,509,4.483870967741935
