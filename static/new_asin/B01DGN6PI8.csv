7712183,3,B01DGN6PI8,"Moody is no Innocent, Strange, or Bright. The plots are confusing and the whole production seems to simply try to round out the series in as quick a way as possible. No chemistry between any of the actors. If a Hathaway series ever is contemplated, they'll have to come up with a new Chief Inspector -- one who knows his detectives and knows police work. Where will Hathaway go now?",1472083200,5,382,4.4714285714285715

7712186,3,B01DGN6PI8,"Impeccably done, as usual, and with the full length episodes as shown in the UK.  It's baffling that idiot PBS cuts these (rendering whole relationships incomprehensible) and then is allowed to profit off the uncut DVD sales.  It would be nice to see an Inspector Hathaway series some day, but since he's such a complex and prickly character it seems unlikely that PBS would fund anything other than flat earth heterosexual squares as the main characters in their product.",1471996800,3,472,4.962025316455696
7712187,4,B01DGN6PI8,"I watch murder mysteries purely for the interplay between the main characters. I can never figure out who done it, so I've stopped trying. In this series, the murders are more convoluted than ever, involving obscure religious sects, taxidermy and science that's way over my head. What a hotbed Cambridge is! If we have a bike theft in my town, it's considered a shocking thing.

Much of the character development in this 3-part series revolves around Robbie Lewis's reluctance to retire (he is a consultant now) and DI James Hathaway's awkward relationship with his ailing father and his saintly sister. As with previous plots involving Hathaway's private life, we never get clear answers to the cause of his existential crises. Personally, I found his spiritual struggles depicted in earlier series to be more compelling than his family troubles in this one. Likewise, Lewis's angst about committing to pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson, retiring and possibly being forgotten seem way overplayed in this series. I much preferred the episodes when he and Laura  were developing feelings for each other, but still were entrenched in their jobs. I guess that's the way it is -- the pursuit is always more exciting than the settling down!

New characters in this series are Chief Superintendent Joe Moody, who may or may not want to give Lewis the axe, and DS Lizzie Maddox, who works for Hathaway. I enjoyed Maddox's screen time -- she's smart and intense, yet also given to girls nights out -- but Moody isn't given much to do except pop onto the scene and give orders. They're all rolling their eyes behind his back, something about his background not meeting with their approval.

Still, just about any show on British television, especially a Masterpiece production, is well worth watching. The very last shot of the show -- and I won't print any spoilers here -- has me hoping that DI Hathaway will get his own series next. Does anyone know if that's in the cards?",1471824000,22,1962,4.882882882882883

PHILIP HATHAWAY:
There are a number of characters common to ""Inspector Morse"" and ""Inspector Lewis""
- most prominently Pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (played by Clare Holman), the love of Inspector Lewis.
She joined the Thames Valley Police in 1995 and was originally a possible love interest for Morse (Sergeant Lewis was married at the time).
Also characters common to ""Endeavour"" and ""Morse"".
But only one character appeared (fifty years apart) in both ""Endeavour"" and ""Inspector Lewis""
- Philip Hathaway, father of Sergeant/Inspector James Hathaway

1967: ""Endeavour"" Season 3, Episode 3
Constable Morse investigates a series of suspicious deaths at Crevecoeur Hall, home of the incredibly wealthy Mortmaigne family.
Philip Hathaway, the Mortmaigne family gardener, is one of the suspects (played by Rob Callender - photo 4)
Ten years later, just in time for the birth of his son, Philip Hathaway is promoted to estate manager

2010: ""Inspector Lewis"" Season 3, Episode 2 (UK Season 4, Episode 1)
There is another suspicious death at Crevecoeur Hall.
Inspector Lewis is surprised to learn that Sergeant Hathaway is no stranger to Crevecoeur Hall or the Mortmaigne family

2015: ""Inspector Lewis"" Season Eight
Philip Hathaway (played by Nicholas Jones - photo 5) returns for the final season of Inspector Lewis.
Now in his seventies, Philip Hathaway is suffering from Alzheimer's and does not recognize his son James
--------------------

Sad News
Series Eight - this box - is the final season of Inspector Lewis.

33 episodes broadcast on British television between 2006 and 2015.
Actor Kevin Whately actually played Robbie Lewis for 28 years (1987-2015).
Before becoming Inspector Lewis, he was Sergeant Lewis to John Thaws Inspector Morse
Final total:
Inspector Morse = 33 Episodes (with Sergeant Lewis)
Inspector Lewis = 33 Episodes (27 with Sergeant Hathaway + the final 6 shared with Inspector Hathaway)
-- Hathaway played by Laurence Fox.

ONE GOOD REASON TO WATCH INSPECTOR LEWIS ON BLU-RAY INSTEAD OF PBS:
Each episode broadcast on PBS was at least ten minutes shorter than the original BBC broadcast.
The Blu-Ray/DVD contains the uncut BBC version.
Season Eight, Episode One was 1:20:32 on Masterpiece Mystery, but is 1:32:10 on the Blu-Ray
(not counting the closing credits).
One slight error: The Blu-Ray reverses the order of the first two episodes.
""One for Sorrow"" is the first episode of Season Eight.
Watch it first.

There is some confusion about Season numbers in the United States and the United Kingdom.
This is due to PBS's decision to broadcast the first three British seasons as two US seasons.
Series 8 (UK) = Season 7 (US)
Series 9 (UK) = Season 8 (US) - the box under review.
There is no difference in content (at least on Blu-Ray/DVD - The PBS broadcasts are a different matter)

From the start, Inspector Lewis has featured a wide-screen picture and English SDH subtitles.

Cast change for Season Eight:
Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent (Rebecca Front) has left the series (transferred to the Suffolk Constabulary).
replaced by:
Chief Superintendent Joseph Moody (Steve Toussaint), who suspects that Inspector Lewis may no longer be up to the job.
Superintendent Innocent felt the same way in 2006, but gradually came around.

Apparently Lewis does not make a good first impression.
This may simply be British class distinction - unlike Morse and Hathaway, Lewis does not seem at home in Oxford.
But Lewis is smarter than he looks.
This can be an advantage. Better-educated villains consistently underestimate Inspector Lewis.
[Morse and Hathaway are exactly as smart as they look.]

For the past thirty years, Oxford University has averaged a murder a week.
Actor Kevin Whately (born 1951) has played the same character - Sergeant, then Inspector Robert Lewis - from age 36 through age 64.

-- a) Inspector Morse, aired 1987-2000 (his Sergeant = D.S. Robert Lewis)
following Morse's death, Sergeant Lewis was promoted to Inspector.

-- b) Inspector Lewis, aired 2006-2015 (his Sergeant = D.S. James Hathaway)
following Lewis's retirement, Sergeant Hathaway was promoted to Inspector.

-- c) Inspector Hathaway doesn't have his own series [yet] because Inspector Lewis, bored with retirement, came back part-time in Season Seven
A slightly resentful Inspector Hathaway now shares the 'Inspector Lewis' series with Inspector Lewis.
Together they share Sergeant Lizzie Maddox (played by Angela Griffin)

-- When Britain's ITV announced the cancellation of ""Inspector Lewis"" in November 2015, they also announced that there would not be an ""Inspector Hathaway"" series.
Let's hope they change their mind.

SERIES BUYING OPTIONS:
[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

The Complete Series - 33 episodes on 18 DVDs is now available - a fabulous bargain.
A good investment if you are new to Inspector Lewis.
WARNING:
Amazon has screwed up the listing of the Complete Series box, confusing it with the Season 1-4 box (which was a disaster - edited episodes, no subtitles)
The top posted reviews on Amazon are for the Season 1-4 box.
The reviewer complaints are no longer valid.
The first posted review of the ""Complete Series"" box was my review titled ""REVIEW OF COMPLETE SERIES IN 18 DVD BOX"" (dated October 15, 2016)

Complicated by the question of Blu-Ray.
Seasons 1-3 were only issued on standard DVDs
For Seasons 4-8 you have the choice of DVD or Blu-Ray.
I recommend Blu-Ray - The architecture and environs of Oxford University are pretty spectacular.

Scandalously, the earliest DVD release of Seasons 1-3  used the edited PBS episodes, but since then all three have been reissued in uncut form.
These versions are OK:

Inspector Morse - played by John Thaw - was the first and best of modern British Police Inspectors.
He is long overdue for remastering and repackaging at a reduced price.
The 25th Anniversary set was a disappointment: Elderly video transfers, No subtitles, Expensive.

(read the review by Happy Reader dated November 11, 2012)
I only hope the upcoming Thirtieth Anniversary may bring an improvement.

And don't forget 'Endeavour', aired 2011-present.
This is a prequel to the Inspector Morse series.
Set in 1960s England (Robbie Lewis was still a schoolboy), when young Police Constable Endeavour Morse  joined the force.
(Morse dropped the first name after he made Inspector).
For links to Endeavour, see the first comment (dated April 9, 2016) following this review.

7712257,5,B01DGN6PI8,"Detective Inspector Morse was such a figure in the annuals of Masterpiece Theatre, particularly the Mystery Division. Since his death, DS Lewis his partner, has gone through one crisis after another. His wife was killed, his partner died, but on the bright side he was promoted to DI. He is still with the Thames Valley Police Department, and their turf is still Oxford. His new partner is a junior partner, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox, who is the epitome of DI Morse! They have the same sort of class rivalry, but it is upended. DI Lewis finally married his Pathologist, and they are happy. He returned to work after retiring several series ago, but he is on the edge of leaving, again. Hathaway became DI, and is is brilliant.

In this series, they deal with murder and mayhem and crimes of retribution. The series is separated into 6 episodes, with 2 episodes related to the same storyline. Lewis is much darker and his life is more complicated than the more frivolous Lewis we knew of yore. The murders in this series are incredibly complex, the stories much more updated and modern. DI Hathaway is from public school and Cambridge, so he seems to fit right in with the characters in these episodes. He smokes, was an athlete and once studied for the priesthood. He is tightly controlled , and he does not reveal much if anything of his background.

Lewis and DI Hathaway are the epitome of opposites attract, and they make the best pair of detectives. Masterpiece is known as giving us the best in performances, and once again, they deliver! Will Lewis leave for good, stay tuned.

The series is filmed at Oxford University and all the episodes are written around the professors or religious sects, and gruesome dead bodies being cut up by the ME. Lewis shows great emotion over the loss of his wife through a hit and run. It is not easy for him when he becomes interested in the lovely medical examiner, Dr. Laura Hobson. Good choice casting. Hathaway struggles with guilt over not going into the Priesthood once he completed university. They are excellent  actors. We vote them nominations for Bafta Awards. A BAFTA for the author Colin Dexter. We like to struggle to understand the British accents. I think I've got it:by George I've got it.
We let years go by before we watch Episodes, up to  5 times now. We will be eagerly watching for news of a return of the series.",1483660800,2,951,4.523255813953488

7712313,4,B01DGN6PI8,"I have enjoyed this series from the first one came out.  Introducing Laurence Fox as his partner was a stroke of genius.  He added so much to the series and the character of Lewis, it made watching a pure pleasure.  I was so happy to see this as a neat conclusion of the many problems Lewis was having with getting older and his relationship with Laura, the woman who helped him to really get on with his life after his wife's death and helped  him enjoy life and again and be a mentor to Hathaway, nicely played by Laurence Fox.  I hope the series will pick up again in the future as the ending on this left a few doors open.  A great pleasure to view this series of Inspector Lewis.  Since I have been a fan since Lewis was partnered with Morse, it has been a great friendship between us the viewer and Sgt. Lewis and how his life has evolved.  The blu-ray was beautiful with the scenery of England.  An all around joy for fans of this wonderful series.",1481846400,11,955,4.232044198895028

7712358,5,B01DGN6PI8,"This is the climex of one of the best Copper shows to come out of England and as a spin-off from another great for its time, Inspector Morse.  In the series, it was satisfying that Lewis accepted Hathaway, or vice versa as it were, and equally so that he learned who killed his wife.  It was interesting to learn why Hathaway became a cop and left the Catholic ministry (pre-seminary at Cambridge).  Throughout the series, poor Lewis, with a consolidated school education through high school, learned his skills the hard way, with Morse being worn down by Morse his boss, always correcting his grammar, and who attended Oxford, and then Lewis his Sergeant, quoting to him Shakespeare or some other poet or writer or philosopher, below him and educated at Cambridge.  But, he took it as he had to and learned to get it right.  And learn, he did.  It was a great run for Kevin Whately, from the mid 80's to the mid teens in a new century, about 30 years and his early role in Miss Marple A Murder is Announced playing a cop guarding the door of the home of the murderer.  A lot of copping for Whately.",1477612800,4,1099,4.437810945273632

  Like in all the episodes these were complete with a brillant plot, cast of characters, great climax, and diligent theme.

My only big disappointment is that the series is over! I had been hoping to see the Robby Lewis and Hathaway filming when I visited Oxford over the summer.

7712446,5,B01DGN6PI8,"It's no longer Inspector Lewis, because he has retired from the Thames Valley Police. To take his place, Detective Sergeant Hathaway is promoted to DI Hathaway. But they still work together because the chief hires Mr. Lewis as a consultant on the thorny jobs.

And the three jobs in Series 8 do have thorns. In addition, we watch Hathaway struggle to bridge the long-standing estrangement with his father, even if it may seem too late.  While Lewis and pathologist Laura Hobson are indeed a couple now, Robbie finds that he is more worried about keeping his job than is good for him or their relationship.

....""Magnum Opus"" (in 2 parts) Phil Beskin has had a lively night at the pub and is on his way home when he receives a text: ""At Boars Hill... Going to end it all."" He rushes to the wooded park, shouting, ""Bina? Bina?"" And then he finds her cell phone.
The next morning, Lewis and Hathaway are called to examine a body found in the woods. Surprise  it is Beskin who is dead. Not only that, he is ""half buried with a bucketful of maggots and dead ravens."" Not your run-of-the-mill murder, and the killer obviously wanted him to be found in all his macabre glory.
....""One For Sorrow"" (2 parts) Renegade artist Talika Desai has her first gallery opening. At the open house, she introduces her main piece: ""It's taxidermy-meets-video art and it's called 'One For Sorrow'. "" Whatever it is, it's going to get her killed.
....""What Lies Tangled"" (2 parts) The suave and charming Professor Adam Capstone arrives at work to find a package waiting for him. Unfortunately, it blows him and his office apart when he opens it. His brother, David, who worked with Adam, tells Lewis and Hathaway that Adam had been getting threatening letters. Could it be a disgruntled student, a disgruntled ""fling"", or a disgruntled wife? Or perhaps something to do with the company's genetic research? Part 1 sets you up with a list of suspects a mile long.

The 3-stories of Series 8 originally aired in October/November 2015. These BluRay and DVD sets are of the ""full UK-Length Edition"", which is 4  hours of mysteries. English SDH subtitles are available on all episodes. There are no Bonus Features.

It can be confusing, but this package is called Series 9 in England. That's because, for U.S. audiences and Region 1 BluRay and DVD releases, the British Series 2, 3 and 4, were combined into only two series.

Whether you call it Series 8 or 9, this is the last we'll see of ""Inspector Lewis"" (titled just ""Lewis"" in England). Laurence Fox decided he would not return for another season as James Hathaway. Then Kevin Whately also announced that playing Robbie Lewis for 30 years was long enough.

Another enjoyable mystery series bites the dust. Ah me!

If you haven't seen Whately's performance as the young Lewis in the original series, ""Inspector Morse"", you are missing an excellent mystery series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Morse-The-Dead-of-Jericho/dp/B00006BSDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Morse - The Dead of Jericho</a>.

It is laughable how they have replaced British actors with foreign actors in every way except the three main characters.  One would think this was a statement to re-enter the EU.  Please, someone tell the BBC that they don't have to kiss up to the EU anymore -- Brexit won!  Get over it!  Next it is inter-racial relationships.  Yes, they do take place in our world, but does every episode have to dish it out in every plot?  Finally, gay relationships are so common now that they are only mentioned casually in the episodes, as if no story is complete without referring to one, or more.  I truly believe that stories about Oxford do not require these 'shop-worn' plot thickeners which are meant to shock but have become boring at best. . .",1472515200,6,829,4.443708609271523

7712454,5,B01DGN6PI8,"Love the Inspector Lewis series. Even though some of these episodes weren't quite the caliber of some of the previous seasons, I am still glad they produced them. I really miss the series. With any luck, we will have another ""final"" season since the ending still left the possibility open.",1472428800,,289,4.8
7712455,3,B01DGN6PI8,"The final series of Inspector Lewis aired in Great Britain on ITV in the fall of 2015 and on PBS in the United States in the summer of 2016. Returning from previous series are DI Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately), who has retired twice unsuccessfully and come to the conclusion that it doesnt agree with him, his partner James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), now a Detective Inspector himself, DS Lizzie Maddox (Angela Griffin), and police pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman), who is Lewis domestic partner. New on the scene is Ch. Supt. Joseph Moody (Steve Toussaint), who replaces Ch. Supt. Jean Innocent. Moody is friendly but eager, tends to micromanage, and wonders if Lewis should retire to make room for a younger officer. The mysteries all involve people who teach and attend Oxford University, but thats incidental. The series has long abandoned its thread of erudition. Hathaway is becoming the more prominent of the pair, but hes not interesting anymore. His new personal drama involves his family, not his faith. The first mystery is better than the other two; the writing is generally lazy and flat. But I suppose the finale is good enough. The episodes are:

An archeological excavation on Oxford University campus reveals the body of an adult male, dead a few years, in One for Sorrow. While DI Lewis, DI Hathaway, and DS Maddox try to identify the victim, a young taxidermist, Talika Desai (Shanaya Rafaat), is found dead in her rooms from a heroin overdose. She was the assistant of the elderly Jasper Hammond (Tim Pigott-Smith), a disgraced former professor who treated Desai like a daughter. Her taxidermy had been featured in an audio-visual exhibition just the night before. Lewis and Hathaway immediately suspect foul play in Desais death. The search for clues leads them to her envious younger sister Sahira (Naomi Scott), her former doctoral tutor Vivian Tedman (Helen Schlesinger), who laments that Talika left the psychology PhD program, and a local library for the homeless run by Bryony Willet (Emma Cunniffe), with new boss Ch. Supt. Joe Moody (Steve Toussaint) looking over their shoulders all the while.

Magnum Opus puts the detectives on the trail of a ritualistic serial killer, after College Dean Phil Beskin (Martin Wenner), an unorthodox religious scholar, is found bludgeoned to death in the woods, his body laid out neatly, with a quote from a 17th century German alchemist left at the scene. The trail leads to Beskins students, his colleagues, and old friends who seem to share some secret, evidenced by a shared tattoo, a symbol of the Holy Trinity borrowed from an ancient religious order. When another of their circle is murdered and ritualistically displayed, the detectives turn up the heat on those remaining: Beskins sister Carina (Honeysuckle Weeks), who suffered a crisis of faith, Jay Fennel (Daniel Flynn), the source of the tattoos, and two students, Nate Hedeson (Jaygann Ayeh) and Gina Doran (Isabella Laughland). But are the murders really about alchemy? Or revenge? Or forgiveness? And where, if at all, does the victims religious unorthodoxy fit in?

What Lies Tangles opens as Adam Capstone (Tristam Summers) is blown to bits by a mail bomb. Capstone was a professor of geometric topology working with knot theory to try to untangle bits of DNA. He and younger brother David Capstone (Oliver Lansley) were funded in their work by the family of Adams blue-blooded, unhappy wife Elizabeth (Zoe Tapper), a chemist who doesnt miss her husband very much. Their lab is run by Andrew Dimmock (Peter de Jersey), to whom David makes mysterious payments. A couple of accusations made against Adam, both by former students, one of violence, another of stealing research, provide the detectives with plenty of leads to follow. But was Adam actually the intended target? As the investigation plods on, DI Lewis procrastinates buying a gift for a trip he and Laura are planning to take to visit family in New Zealand. Lewis is afraid that, if he leaves for a holiday, hell find himself obsolete when he returns.",1472256000,18,4052,5.026785714285714
7712456,5,B01DGN6PI8,"If youve read my other reviews on Amazon you will know that Im a huge fan of British (or Irish or Scottish) crime and mystery series produced by the BBC or ITV , which air on US TV on either BBC America or PBS.  I really prefer the home video versions because nearly every one of this shows has been edited (for either language or extreme violence  often both  and maybe even brief nudity). I prefer the original.

Im  a big proponent of not providing episode plot summaries (as some do) because IMHO it spoils the enjoyment. And I most certainly don't like spoilers, so you rarely  if ever  will find one in my reviews. After all, these are called mysteries for a reason.

Since this is the EIGTH n the series, I will make the assumption that those reading this review will have seen Seasons 1 through 7  and know the know the main characters and that the crime/mystery series takes place in Oxford, England.  There are THREE  episodes  each lasting from 93 to 97 minutes (The running time listed includes 90 second sponsorship advertisements) . Since PBS always includes promo ads at beginning and end of their broadcasts, I know that some scenes were edited for US TV (but I cant tell you which). There is no nudity but there are a few expletives (the S### word for one) so it is probably more for some violent scenes that were cut. The BD version is marked as the full UK version.  The show aired in the UK on the commercial ITV networks, not the BBC.

As other reviewers have pointed out there is a major flaw in the BD (and probably the DVD) that you should be aware of  but its correctible. The First episode in this series  One For Sorrow appears SECOND on the playlist. You need to watch that first. I didn't catch this and wondered why some of the life at the police station events seemed confusing. Speaking of that, there is a running story about the personal lives of the two leads, but each episode mostly hinges on a murder.

Its not a spoiler IMHO to say that this is the last of this wonderful series. But Im happy to say that there are really no loose ends at the end  as some suddenly cancelled PBS series have had.

As I watched the three episodes I was drawn into the mysteries and was enjoying the acting. The writer does not give the viewer ALL the clues needed to solve the crime until near the end, so you  along with the detectives, are still kept in the dark, so to speak.

The BD of  this season has NO  special features  not even a short behind the scene one that most DVDs  have.
The BD and DVD do have an option for English subtitles and these did prove helpful to me . The accents of some of the characters  and the speed of their voices  on this series made me want to use the subtitles so I could see words that were not familiar to me. Im happy to say that the subtitles are in bright yellow (unlike the white that some shows use) which makes them stand out. But these subtitles move! Yes, move! First it will be in the bottom left of the screen and the next one is in the bottom right and, sometimes, it will be in the bottom middle. Since the show is presented wide-screen, it means that your eyes must move to find the words before they disappear.  Im not sure who at PBS decided to present them this way but I hope they stop.

As I post this review I see a few others posted before this which are long  and the reviewer chose to provide so much plot detail that it really, IMHO, spoils the enjoyment for a person who has not already watched the episodes. And, there is a lot of discussion comparing the series with Endeavour (which  is the prequel to Lewis; there is no Inspector in the on-screen title). Ill leave reading those other reviews up to you, but you might want to read them AFTER youve seen this series.

I do  hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

If you like to use your computer to view DVDs, note that this version includes the intentional DVD error copy protection scheme that PBS has been using on recent releases.
