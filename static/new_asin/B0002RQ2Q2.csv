2116045,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"Michael Moore produces books and films that try to show what is actually happening in society. The USA seems dominated by idiots such as M.Sturdivant, who think George Bush is some kind of god. Wake up and smell the coffee guy! What about the budget deficit? How many soldiers are dying daily in IRAQ? Is any of this the fault of Kerry or Michael Moore? No, the responsibility lies solely with the Bush administration. You really need to watch F911 and actually learn something about the way you are manipulated.",1095552000,28,512,4.7
2116076,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"I think this is now out of print but if you can find it, it's worth a reasonable price. Two great films by Michael Moore, and a bonus disc of stirring material. My only complaint are that The Big One isn't featured in widescreen, and the packaging is just merely a box with an opening at the top. I was expecting an artbox where you can slide the DVDs out of the side.",1134000000,2,368,4.054794520547945
2116077,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"Being a huge fine of MM like I am, I just bought this package on a whim.  I was not disappointed. The package has ""The Big One"", ""Bowling For Columbine"", and a separate DVD about ""Dude, Where's My  Country"" tour that he did last year.

The Bowling for Columbine DVD has 4 hours of extras including his Oscar acceptance speech and interviews. In the separate DVD, MM talks about how we need representation in our congress - like if there are 10% Greens(Independants, democrats, etc) in the U.S. - there should be 10% Greens in congress, he also talks about looking at other media sources besides the U.S. to find out what's actually going on here because our media doesn't tell us or ask the questions that they should.

Bowling for Columbine is about gun control and The Big One is about corporate downsizing and greed.  Moore's work is always stuff which leaves you happy, thoughful and full of will to make a positive change.  You will learn a lot!",1098403200,25,950,4.5588235294117645
2116078,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"Leather Wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper, because, you know, a dvd makes good toilet paper (maybe it's why he's so grumpy).

I would suggest purchasing it and watching it.  Michael Moore may be more to the left than some, but god, hasn't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye?  It's less biased than the news is - he reports, you decide, and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion, but weren't.

Michael Moore is far more honest than the Republican talking heads (Rush, Coulter, Hannity).  Watch, enjoy, investigate further.",1097884800,41,614,4.700934579439252

2116080,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"Michael Moore's film ""Bowling for Columbine"" was incisive and thought provoking.  As usual, Moore draws no specific conlusions from the facts he presents.  He allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  Moore's presentation of hard, cold facts may be unpleasant for those that prefer a system of blind faith over rationalism.  Those individual's that adhere to principles of honest, open, and rational discourse will find any film (or book) by Moore to be interesting introductory material to any social, economic, or political issue of contemporary importance.  Moore has delivered another brilliant analysis of the crises facing the citizens of the United States.",1096502400,29,671,5.475728155339806
2116081,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"I don't think anyone wants to know your opinon on the man just rate the movie.  If you have something to say to him or about him go to his web site, this is not the place.

Now i think all his films are very informative if you look at them through objective eyes.  I know more now about these topics (ex: the war on Iraq) than before i saw his movies.  If you hate these movies just ask yourself, ""Is this the truth or more true that what you get from FOX news or ABC?""",1096329600,32,469,3.8541666666666665
2116082,5,B0002RQ2Q2,"It's so silly how Michael Moore is criticized purely based on what trashy Fox News watchers see on TV.  They claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble, when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie & then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts FOR FREE.  Clearly, this man is doing it all for the money.

If his words are so insincere, why has the president not sued him for slander?

And why can't anyone slamming the movie ever make any specific reference? It's always a general statement about michael moore being one explictive or another, and never about something he actually says.  Could it be, maybe, that they don't even know why they hate him?",1096070400,48,697,4.634146341463414
2116083,1,B0002RQ2Q2,"Michael Moore Hates America. This is evident in all of his movies and also proven when he goes oversees to make money by badmouthing us here at home.

8030838,2,B0002RQ2Q2,"""Bowling for Columbine""

The film starts by showing a North Country bank in Michigan where a depositor can get a free gun. [How much money is needed?] Michael Moore shows his sense of humor in these opening scenes. Can a dog commit a crime in Michigan? Moore is incorrect in claiming Gandhi ""beat the British Empire"", that statement is incomplete. One scene shows a student's interest in chemistry. Some live news scenes follow, but the film doesn't explain them. Recognize them? Then a short history of US political coups and massacres in foreign countries since WW II. Moore associates the terrorist bombing in Kosovo (no military objective) with the shootings at Columbine high school. Next we see Charlton Heston standing up for his right to travel peacefully to an NRA convention. Outside a small group protests the right of the NRA to peacefully assemble! (How un-American!) Moore shows the views of some students. What does this say about their Educational system? Next Moore interviews a singer; is any musician or actor a reliable source of wisdom? Bowling can be educational, according to these scenes. Moore's statistics are biased since it does not compare the rates of violent deaths. That frantic cartoon is not historically accurate, a mistake for any ""documentary"". Killer bees are in fact invading America, along with fire ants.

More scenes follow, they are either biased and racist, or, reflect the reality of an oppressed people. Who was blamed when blacks were scarce as in late 19th century American cities? Some people say crime rate was falling but the corporate media featured crimes in the TV news. Really true? A producer explains the rationale of the ""Cops"" TV show. Does it reinforce prejudice? The film shows a small town in Canada; it has few murders (like a similar small town in America). One good question is why the murder rate is lower in Canada. [But if it is just about the same as in America, why ask?] Small towns in America may have the same unlocked doors of small town Ontario. Creating fear is a well-known method for controlling a subject population.

Moore points out how bad economic conditions are reflected in a high homicide rate, but this is not ""news"" for the corporate media. Basically, it tells how poor people are oppressed by having a long commute. Maybe they need public housing located close to their job? The stunt at the chain store that sold bullets seems unfair, I wonder why that chain later suffered an economic setback? There is a final interview with Charlton Heston. Moore's question about the murder rates seems dishonest (look up these rates for yourself). The rate of violent deaths in Canada is similar to the USA. Given Canada's northern latitude it should be lower. Did Moore drag out the interview to cause Charlton Heston to leave for his next appointment? If so, was this honest? Moore is a skilled showman if he can make this collection of scenes into popular entertainment.

Documentaries lie on the continuum between news and fiction. Anything real, filmed as it happens, is ""news""; except for sports, it is rare on TV. Fiction must appear plausible to be believed by the audience. Documentaries are ""recreations of authenticated facts"" like the nature films on TV. They are created and edited to portray a point of view. Their success depends on the number of consumers who pay, dollars not academic truths. The use of films for propaganda (a point of view) follows the use of newspapers, pamphlets, and books. Some are better than others, and age gracefully. Did Moore create scenes by splicing together separate events? Are speeches taken out of context? Are events portrayed without their background? Its all part of Show [me the money] Business, the art of getting people's money in return for telling a story. Does exploiting the Columbine massacre show poor taste by Michael Moore?

One Big Lie is that America has more gun violence than other countries. That is as true as saying America has more automobile deaths than other countries. America's rate of violent death (suicides and murders) falls behind France, Switzerland, etc., and Japan, but just ahead of Canada. Canada's crime rate was lower before 1977 when they banned handguns; now it approaches American rates. There is no mention of Mexico, Brazil, or Argentina, who have similar colonial and revolutionary pasts. Any research will reveal these facts, which are usually suppressed in the Corporate Media. If America was such a violent hell on earth there wouldn't be 3,000 illegal immigrants each day! They flee ""gun free zones"" like Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala.",1186790400,,4618,4.976683937823834
