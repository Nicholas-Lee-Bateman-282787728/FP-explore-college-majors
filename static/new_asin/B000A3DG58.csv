8073993,5,B000A3DG58,"Hi, I'm hoping that someone who has already purchased this will help me out.  My boyfriend's birthday is in a couple of days and he absolutely LOVES the UFC fights.  He records them any time a fight comes on, and I am just wondering which DVD package is worth the money.  There are so many out there to choose from; volumes 6 and so on, all the way up to 50-something!!  ANY suggestions will be highly appreciated!!",1156118400,,415,4.35064935064935
8073994,1,B000A3DG58,Just terrible and not worth the money.  The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill.  Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.,1152489600,,179,4.741935483870968
8073995,5,B000A3DG58,"if this box contains...

40, 43-50 + Ultimate knockouts 1 & 2

or

43-51 + Ultimate knockouts 1 & 2 & 3

there is some websites selling this pack and each one has different information about the content of the package.

Please help me, I'm thinking in buying this item and I want UFC 40 Vendetta, and I don't know if this one is included in The Ultimate DVD Collection

Thanks!!!!!!!",1148860800,,383,4.323943661971831
8073996,5,B000A3DG58,"This is simply a sick collection.  The discs are bundled nicely in this good-looking DVD package, contained in a book of hard protective plastic.

In this collection, you get UFC 40, 43 through 50, plus Ultimate Knockouts Volumes 1 & 2!  These particular UFC events took place mainly during the era of Matt Hughes, Randy Couture, Chuck Lidell and Tito Ortiz.  You get to see Rich Franklin and Andrei Arlovski beginning their rises that ultimately led them both to championships.  You see Matt Hughes dominate his opponents and even lose a bout, proving that he was not, after all, invincible.  There are so many terrific fights in this collection and there is bonus material included on each DVD where you get insight into the events and fighters involved.  It's truly interesting material.

Finally, you get Ultimate Knockouts 1 & 2, filled with some of the most devastating blows ever seen in UFC competition.  I couldn't have asked for anything more!  Amazing fights and action.

Highly recommended.",1140566400,40,1002,4.975903614457831
8073997,5,B000A3DG58,"This is one of the best collections I have ever owned. It contains PPV's 41,43-50 and ultimate knockouts. A must buy for any fan.",1137715200,8,129,4.416666666666667
8073998,5,B000A3DG58,"I already had 2 of the UFC's in this collection, but I couldn't pass up getting it and was not dissapointed.  I don't know how it is, but even though I've already seen the fights and know what happens, it is never boring watching them a 2nd time.

If you are an MMA fan I don't really need to explain to you why the set is good, and if you're not an MMA fan, I ask why?

I give it 5 starts and only have 1 problem with it.  They give you UFC 40, then 43-50 & Ultimate KO's 1&2.  I was really dissapointed it didn't have UFC 41 Onslaught, or UFC 42 Sudden Impact.  I guess I will have to get those separate.",1135900800,12,606,3.846774193548387
8073999,5,B000A3DG58,"I have really enjoyed my UFC Ultimate DVD Collection.  I am a fan of Mixed Martial Arts and this DVD collection was perfect.  Although, I do have one small complaint about these DVDs.  The first five DVDs or so have issues with audio quality, or at least mine does.  The volume has sags and spikes throughout the video and it is a little distracting.  However, this does not take away from the display of MMA.  The packaging is very nice for this collection.  The DVDs are housed in a book-like fashion in tough plastic holders.  You also get a small informative booklet on the UFC as an organization.  Definitely worth the price paid.  Keep in mind that the UFC is not about drawing blood and breaking bones, although this stuff happens.  There are matches where not a single punch is thrown and in my opinion, those make for some of the best fights.  I also like the Gracie Jiu Jitsu system, so I'm not about to spend a lot of money to watch a brawl or two men flailing their fists about.  That stuff can be seen at a bar fight where intelligence is not required.  So, if you like a great display of MMA, and I'm not talking about an organized ""tough man"" contest, get these DVDs.",1135468800,11,1182,4.362385321100917
