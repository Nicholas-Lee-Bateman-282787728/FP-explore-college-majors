Shattering all of the carnal commandments, a self-ordained messenger of the Lord, Reverend Jerry, leads an insidious double-life. Passionately imploring his followers to donate freely to high cause, the good Reverend misdirects the funds towards his hedonistic pursuit of sexual depravity at Madame Blanche`s -- a whore-house where he preaches to the painted ladies with his true sword of the lord.
This film does what Fifty Shades of Grey should have done
For the time this was made it's dark and has very heavy social commentary

Marathon (1982)

Originally hitting the home video market on VHS
It did receiver a average dvd version by also by Caballero
Cast include: Herschel Savage,  John Holmes,Misty Dawn, Ron Jeremy, Sharon Mitchell, Mai Lin, Crystal Lake, Jamie Gillis

They gave a party and everybody came!
Who likes to party hearty? Well, when champion hot-dogger Bill and sizzling slope-strumpet Drea win a big ski contest, they decide to throw a bang-up party no one will ever forget. Rest assured, this is one party where everyone comes in a Marathon orgy of unequaled X-rated action.

These two films being  paired up is very strange
The only thing they have in common is there Director
Marathon is the film you'll buy this set for
The saving grace for Lust Inferno is the commentary track by one of the stars
Both films have plenty of heavy hitters that were on the ground floor of the adult  entertainment boom
It's extremely solid and a must own for classic 35mm fans/collectors  8.8/10",1482192000,,2029,4.991097922848665

 Second flick is uncreative and somewhat boring",1460332800,3,120,5.315789473684211
