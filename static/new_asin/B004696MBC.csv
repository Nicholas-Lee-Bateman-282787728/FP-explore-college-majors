8452019,2,B004696MBC,"I am a huge MotoGp fan and figured I'd see some great up and coming footage of my favorite MotoGp hero's here, which is why I eagerly bought this one as soon as it came out. I dare admit I actually pre-ordered it here at Amazon. Ulitmately was pretty disapointed. Although somewhat interesting at first as they go through the current field of MotoGp riders starts it doesn't really go anywhere from there or show how they developed from there to where they are at now. I had big hope for this video, assuming fullishly that it might take us nearly up to date or close to where these top riders have made it since their earlier days, but it really doesn't and disappoints because of it.",1297382400,3,685,4.4015748031496065
