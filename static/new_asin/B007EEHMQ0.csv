8515248,5,B007EEHMQ0,"I have Multiple Sclerosis and this is a great way to exercise no matter what level of your disability is and how old you are. There are three levels (it goes from easy to hard)and each one has a resting period. You don't have to have a cooling jacket unless you are exercising in a hot area.
