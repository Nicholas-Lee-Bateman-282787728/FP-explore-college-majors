1036246,5,6305434239,"it really does have all Goju-Ryu Kata on the one tape. Not only that but the master provides detailed bunkai for almost EVERY single technique in each Kata. Fantastic value for money and a pleasure to watch: Master Higaonna is power, elegance and simplicity all rolled into one.",1001289600,7,278,4.8125
1036247,5,6305434239,"Unlike some of the videos which Higaonna made when he was older, this presents him in a younger, powerful display of all twelve goju kata, plus the bunkai of all except tensho...if you practice traditional okinawan goju ryu, this is a must have...",1000252800,7,247,4.767441860465116
1036248,5,6305434239,"So often, the way a company does karate videos is to put one or two kata on each video and then charge an arm an a leg for each one. It's great to have all the Goju-ryu kata on one video.
Morio Higaonna is one of the  premier Goju-ryu practitioners and everything that he does, every little  detail of his kata is done intentionally and for the specific purpose of  generating more power in his punches, kicks and strikes. One of the most  impressive things that he does is turn around. His turns are precise and  quick and stop on a dime. It is a sight to behold, that's for  sure.
Having seen home video footage of Morio Higaonna adds even more to  seeing this video production. He looks exactly the same doing kata in the  back of someone's dojo in one take as he does doing kata on this video. I'm  impressed.",954460800,16,813,4.261437908496732
1036249,5,6305434239,"How often can you watch a Karate master, filmed in their prime, demonstrating their art?  Morio Higaonna demonstrates the twelve kata that make up the Goju Ryu Karate system, as well as applications of some of the  movements.  You do not have to be a practitioner of Goju to get a lot out  of this video.  And if you do practice Goju, you absolutely must have this  video!  An awesome reference guide, and very inspirational!",924998400,22,425,4.586666666666667
7890132,5,6305434239,"I've had this video for a couple of years and have watched it many times. It's great overall. The Katas are well performed and the bunkai is very insightful. My only gripe is that the DVD's chapters are not cued to the beginning of the specific sections of the video, but this happens often on conversions of VHS videos to DVD - so I'm kind of used to it. Good buy overall!",1368057600,,373,4.194444444444445
7890133,5,6305434239,"Even though I am most familiar with the Shotokan Karate style, I have an interest in numerous traditional karate systems such as Goju Ryu.  Even though I practiced all the Shotokan Karate katas, I wanted to learn some Goju katas.  This excellent DVD, along with some other Karate DVDs by Morio Higaonna has helped me to learn a little about Goju Ryu Karate.

This volume does not go into great length on the details of performing each kata, but it is a great summary guide to the katas for those who are actively studying Goju Ryu under an instructor. The katas covered in this volume include:  Sanchin, Gekisai Dai Ichi, Gekisai Dai Ni, Saifa, Seiyunchin, Shisochin, Sanseru, Seipai, Kururunfa, Sesan, Suparinpei, and Tensho. In conclusion, this is a must DVD for anyone interested in Goju Ryu katas.

7890135,4,6305434239,"Goju is one of my foundational styles with Kyokushinkai.  This is an opportunity for you to see the master at work.  Excellent form and execution a must have.  Now you can compare your form to the highest authority today.  But like everyone else I have problems in finding exactly what I want when I want it.  It would also be nice if it had multiple angles but that would make this way to long.  It shows all 12 katas of Goju. This DVD was probably a reproduction of a video tape and hopefully in the future they will update thier efforts.
However, don't let that detract from you watching this DVD, you don't have to be a Goju stylist to enjoy this video.  This is a historical video in that you get to see the highest authority in Goju today when he was still working his way up.",1242777600,,782,4.243243243243243
7890136,4,6305434239,Wonderfull to see Higaonna. A pitty that nothing is done with the new medium DVD. There are no chapters. Just have to find the katas in the old fasion way by scrolling for- en backwards.,1120435200,2,186,4.3428571428571425
7890137,5,6305434239,"As Taikyoku kata has never formed part of Goju Ryu, it is not surprising to find it absent from a program dedicated to Goju Ryu karate that is presented by its greatest living exponent.

The reviewer also needs help with his English!",1119225600,2,233,4.5476190476190474
7890138,5,6305434239,This video tape by Morio Higaonna is by far the best Goju tape I've seen for the money.. He includes all Kata's on one tape .. Great tape to get the basic fundamentals down.. I highly recommend it.. A + +,1093305600,3,204,4.0
7890139,4,6305434239,"The performance in this DVD is excellent as far as I can tell, and those I've talked to who know more than I do don't have anything deragatory to say in that area.  The lighting and setting is a bit annoying, but completely forgivable as this is a ""historical"" performance, and you can see all the detail you need to anyway.  What really flabbergasts me is that there are no intelligently outlined scenes or ""tracks"" -- I should be able to look up where Saifa starts (or where the applications of it start after the formal demonstration ends), and click to that track immediately, instead of scanning through tons of stuff to find it.  It's amazing to me how such simple and obvious markers (that wouldn't at all affect a viewing from start to finish) could have been left ouf of this DVD.  The start screen is the most basic I've ever seen on a DVD (green screen!), so I have to assume that whoever produced this DVD did it as their first project.  I hope Hanshi Morio Higaonna has someone reproduce this into a more usable DVD as a second edition, and then also preferably follows that up with well indexed DVD versions of his technical video series.",1089676800,9,1152,4.492822966507177
7890140,5,6305434239,"Very good response time in receiving the vidio tape and in NEW contition. Vidio itself is very clear, thorough, and pertains very much to what the title indicates. It will be a great training aid to my son taking Goju Ryu Karate.",1064102400,,229,4.476190476190476
