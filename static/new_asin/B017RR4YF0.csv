Had to rewatch the thing and found out I got as much out of missing a good part of it as I did veiwing the whole thing. It has been not that long since I rented this movie and already I couldn't tell you what it was about and it ain't cause I have Alzheimers, its the movies fault. Seen worse though thats for sure.",1462924800,,400,3.8313253012048194
8740390,2,B017RR4YF0,"Frank Mitchel (Frank Raffel- writer director, egotist) is hired to save the kidnapped daughter (Yho Yamashita- might pass for hot Asian chick) of big Pharma. She is kidnapped because its pharmacy lab overseas is doing human experiments and creating zombies...or crazy people with bad make-up. A military group is hired to extinguish all evidence because a simple rescue and fighting zombies won't fill 90 minutes. This is a viral infection. The incubation period is anywhere from immediate (people infected in the beginning) to a day (stars infected during the film).

The scenes inside the house had a slight echo and Frank Raffel should not be in front of the camera. The actors were unconvincing in their lines. I was bored for much of the film. Frank attempts to get cute at the end with some twists, too bad he bores us up to that point. I am not sure what the DVD cover has to do with the film.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. 1 1/2 stars",1457308800,2,946,4.625
