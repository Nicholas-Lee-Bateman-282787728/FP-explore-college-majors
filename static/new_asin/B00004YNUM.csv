1376950,4,B00004YNUM,"Maybe because it wasn't released in theaters first, this movie is a little more open about naming and referring to God than Prince of Egypt was, which is a plus. The animation is just as excellent as the original, and the songs are wonderful. ""You Know Better"" is simply splendid, and must have been written by a person of faith. The changes in the movie from the Bible are relatively minor (Rachel is alive when Joseph is sold; Reuben's efforts to save Joseph are ignored; Joseph does not rise to be in charge of the jail). The one thing I really didn't like was when his brothers asked forgiveness for selling him, Joseph replied by asking their forgiveness for thinking himself a ""miracle child,"" instead of saying ""What you meant for evil, God meant for good."" However, that could be counted a minor point as well. Otherwise, quite true to the original story and very moving.",974851200,11,879,4.641025641025641
1376951,4,B00004YNUM,"I watched this video mindful of the strong expectations I had after The Prince of Egypt and also the strong influence the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat had on me.  After these 2, I expected a bit more from Joseph : King of Dreams, but this was still an excellent movie! The story is slightly altered from actual biblical viewpoint, but is true to the most important points. Being an artist myself, it was the art that first captured me in The Prince, and it remains true in Joseph.  The music is also wonderful, not quite so powerful as The Prince, but overall excellant, especially Better Than I, which hits home so much.  I would recommend this movie to all Christians and even those who are just curious about the Christian faith.  It will certainly give you a good interpretation of one of the best-known stories out of the Bible.  ENJOY!",974678400,5,866,4.633986928104576
1376952,4,B00004YNUM,"I was really excited, after seeing ""Prince of Egypt"", when Dreamworks announced that it was making 2 sequels. What can I say about Joseph, except, it's a sequel.  One thing that I enjoyed about P.O.E. was that it was a Biblical film where GOD wasn't ignored. It had wonderful special effects created miracles, and was an uplifting and spiritually centered picture. Then came Joseph...The miracle...Joseph was born to his mother, who was barren. And that WAS a miracle. It gets 3 minutes in a song ""I am a miracle child""! That self-righteous diddy which made me want to sell the kid to the slave traders. Joseph isn't so much a Biblical epic, as a good movie of the week. I got tear-jerked in the middle of the film with a song about God's foreknowledge of His plans for his people. After that, not much. I hear the next Dreamworks, Old Testement combo will be about Noah and the Flood. Perhaps the mention of God and some miracles will be in the next Biblical epic. I'd say, see it, but if you are a person of faith, don't hope for too much. This one was made for the masses.",974332800,19,1075,4.429292929292929
1376953,5,B00004YNUM,"Barring some scriptural inaccuracies (a disclaimer admits to the dramatic license taken), Joseph is a wonderful, inspiring version of the Biblical tale.  The songs are decent for a video production, and some of them actually stand out quite well.
The majority of the story talks about Joseph's journey of faith and hope, and how he overcame hurdle after hurdle to properly share the gifts that God had given him.
A little light on the religious side, Joseph plays up the entertainment value of the story (as with most films).  However, it never deviates from the fact that Joseph believes his ability to interpret dreams is a gift from God. Far too few films  are willing to take this chance...  Kudos to Dreamworks for a top notch production.
NOTE TO PARENTS:  Though there is nothing outwardly objectionable, there is some serious subject matter that you may want to discuss with your children.  :-)",973814400,49,901,4.894736842105263
1376954,3,B00004YNUM,"This movie isn't a ""classic animation movie"" like Bambi, but it is definitely a good adult-type animated movie.  The songs are wonderful, although I can't find out how to get a soundtrack.  I definitely would not suggest this movie to any young children, but young teens on up should get a lot out of this movie.",973728000,4,312,4.553571428571429
1376955,4,B00004YNUM,"DreamWorks first direct-to-video release is outstanding.  Once again, a disclaimer is run in the beginning (just like in the ""Prince of Egypt"") that they took artistic license with the story but don't worry, all of the main story elements were kept.  If you liked what DreamWorks did with the ""Prince of Egypt"", you can't go wrong here.  Expect a film with the same animation style (with less computer generated animation) and feel as ""Prince"".  The extra features on the DVD were also a nice plus.  The ""read-along"" story supplement was the first one I've seen that actually incorporated parts of the animated movie with story ""stills"" and text.  Enjoy!",973728000,4,654,4.954128440366972
1376956,3,B00004YNUM,"Dreamworks' latest biblical film effort, ""Joseph:  King of Dreams,"" maintains the high visual quality of its 1999 ""The Prince of Egypt"" but falls short of that film's inspirational qualities and theological subtleties.  The animation is outright stunning in places, and is consistently of movie-theater quality -- one wonders why this was not developed as a theatrical release.  Perhaps it is because the script departs from the book of Genesis in significant ways -- more significant than viewers of the film's opening disclaimer would be led to believe, ways that dramatically alter the theological message of the story.  What could have been a nuanced story is ""flattened"" to a simplistic moral lesson.  I commend Dreamworks for a commitment to developing family-friendly entertainment based on biblical stories, but hope that they will devote more time and effort to making future projects reflect the richness and even ambiguity of their source material.  ""Dumbing down"" the original stories does not serve viewers well, whether they are religious-minded or not.",973641600,22,1067,5.4363636363636365

1377024,5,B00004YNUM,"This is a pretty great DVD. It has a lot more special features than I was expecting for a one disc DVD. A lot of the special features are geared more towards smaller children with matching games, coloring sheets and activity sheets you can print, and a trivia game about the movie, all of which are interactive as a DVD-rom. It also has sing-alongs to every song in the film and a read-along with a narrator and brief clips from the film. I was most interested in the features for adults. They include the original trailer for the film, and long write-ups of the cast and crew bios. The best part was a commentary by the directors of two scenes from the film in their original versions and how they progressed to the final version. It was very interesting to learn how the movie came about and what went into its creation. If you are interested in behind the scenes information, the commentary is interesting to listen to and view.

The movie also looks pretty great, and is a wonderful film for all ages. It's beautiful and I love the music; I was a little surprised it was a direct to DVD release because it's really good, unlike a lot of direct to DVDs. I wish they still made movies like this. I just discovered it though, so I was very pleased and found it a huge treat. It's very good and I think everyone who enjoyed the Prince of Egypt will like this. I actually liked it better, but that's just me perhaps.",1435276800,4,1415,4.359848484848484
1377025,5,B00004YNUM,"I got this movie (Joseph: King of Dreams) in a Double Feature DVD, along with the equally impressive The Prince of Egypt.

This is a wonderful adaptation of the biblical story of Joseph from the book of Genesis, so watching this film might be most effective and rewarding if you're already familiar with the story.

The films animation is splendid; it is an interesting interpretation that brings to life the ancient times in which the story takes place.

The actors who provide the voice talent all do a great job, and the music (by Danny Pelfrey) and the songs (by John Bucchino) are great, they are tender and moving and complement the visuals very effectively.

A side note: There are many great animated films, yet this movie is one of the biggest animated film favorites of my primary-school-age daughters.

It manages to portray a mostly realistic relationship between Joseph and his brothers (although sans many of the biblical elements such as the confusing familial relationship with polygamy and such) and how they grew to hate him. There's some nice symbolism and some great dream sequences with a good emotional moments thrown in.

However, for a song with so many musical numbers, it has a problem that all of them are instantly forgettable.  There are some unnecessary changes to the storyline that seem to diminish Joseph. And I have to admit the coat of many colors wasn't quite how I imagined, but it wasn't horrible.

All ends well,when Joseph becomes reunited with his family. It presents the story that was touching and provides a sincere theme about forgiveness and having faith in God in times of trials and difficulties.

The movie also features several original songs sung by Maureen McGovern and Jodi Benson. The soundtrack features music and lyrics written by John Bucchino such as ""Miracle Child"",""Bloom"" and ""Better Than I"".These songs make the movie worth watching and highly entertaining.

It is the story of Joseph and the coat of many colors from the Bible.

It teaches that often life can take turns we never imagined.  But no matter what happens, we never face it alone.  Many may come and go from our lives, and often let us down, but God is with us and can change the story.  He sees ahead.

It is a very inspiring story, and the movie was well done.  We did not get bored, and the kids very much enjoyed the story line and how the story ended.  I loved the music in it and the singing.  Very well done.

I recommend this for children, it teaches them life lessons without them even knowing it, and is a beautifully done movie.  Sure to please the kids, great movie for a family to watch together.

I liked this production so much I bought 4 other movies from the same company.  I have been very happy with them all.

1377106,1,B00004YNUM,"We watched about the first 10 or 15 minutes and shut it off.  For starters, the first song is about how Joseph is the miracle child (and it goes on and on)  and when Joseph sings it, it comes off egotistical, like look how great I am.  Sure, he was a miracle child in the sense that Rachel had *finally* born a child.  But his parents are constantly on him and making him study the Scriptures because they say he is set apart.  The Bible does not even remotely hint that ANYONE knew beforehand what Josephs life (hardships and all) would accomplish.  And then theres the scary wolves -- my 6-year-old son got scared and we had to bring him into a different room -- what was the point of this?  Too many liberties taken by the writers.  The story itself was interesting enough to make a movie about without the extra stuff to make it scarier.

The music is great. There's no point going into the Scriptural inconsistencies--every Bible story ever retold in a fictionalized account has them.  It is better to just appreciate this for the parts that really bring the story to life, and be thankful if you know your Bible well enough to identify the things that are wrong, and the things that were put in as creative speculation.

People of faith that are honest with themselves and others have had times in their life when we know our past,we see where we are in the present and we ask why is this happening to us.

1377152,1,B00004YNUM,"I am a great fan of ""Prince of Egypt"", which is what drew me to ""Joseph: King of Dreams"".  I'm glad to say that I rented it instead of buying it.  The story overall is an insipid, shallow re-telling of the Biblical version (I'm familiar with the Christian version only--I can't speak to how this compares to Jewish and Islamic traditions).

Here are the main problems with this film:
1. The songs are cringe-inducing and suck up valuable time.
2. There is very little characterization.  Joseph is an unsympathetic brat.  His brothers are bland, stereo-typical animated villains.  Reuben doesn't even get a name-drop.
3. There is no spirituality.  God is mentioned once or twice by Jacob and in a pointless sung montage.  Joseph never shows any devotion or gratitude to God for his gift.
4. The greatest moments of the story--the brothers' redemption and Joseph forgiving them--are shoved into the last five minutes of the movie with almost no set-up at all.

""King of Dreams"" does have a few bright spots:
1. Potiphar's role is expanded and fleshed out.  He is actually the most dynamic and interesting character in this.
2. Asenath, Joseph's Biblical wife, gets some screen time (though she is as bland as her husband).
3. The animation is decent for a direct-to-video release.  The animators at least put some effort into this, even if no one else did.

I recommend ""Prince of Egypt"" if you want a beautiful, spiritual animated film.  If you have your heart set on ""Joseph"", I recommend Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Technicolor Dreamcoat.""  It may be goofy and campy, but at least it admits it.  And the songs are better.",1281312000,14,1617,4.807971014492754
1377153,3,B00004YNUM,"This was a good film, though it certainly does not approach its predecessor, Prince of Egypt. The songs are decent, and the animation is very good.  The characterizations of the Egyptians are more developed than Genesis, but most of the Istraelites do not show even their Biblical individuality.  I liked it, but if you really want a good Joseph movie for the kids, consider Joseph and the Amazing Techinicolor Dreamcoat first.",1227571200,4,427,5.0
1377154,3,B00004YNUM,"Firstly, the animation, musicianship and general production of this DVD was top quality.  My son (3) was captivated by the story.  I must say also that, for all of the other animated Biblical stories out there, the production quality is in the top 1%. However...

There is a ""disclaimer"" at the beginning of this dvd which states roughly that they took some artistic liberties with the story but they felt that they kept to the intent or them of the Word.

I disagree.
1) The producers of this animation added items that were not part of the original story (i.e. Joseph's very first dream is about wolves chasing and killing a sheep)
2) They also left out some intricacies which, in my opinion  would have added to the story (Completely absent from the story is that Jospeh's mother died while giving birth to his brother).
3) Jospeh's intentions were mis-characterized.  Joseph never had ill-will to his brothers according to the Bible.  However, in this movie, he describes them as thieves to his wife... clearly missing the redemptive purpose of his actions towards his brothers.
4) Benjamin was born before Joseph was sold. In the film, Joseph had  never met Benjamin until he was brought by his brothers to Egypt.  This doesn't seem in accordance to what happened in the story.

What I did like: Potiphar's Wife and her advances to Jospeh were tastefully handled.

There are more inconsistencies. I'm not asking for perfection, but I strongly believe that there is a great responsibility when adapting Biblical stories for children.  Stick to THE Script.

Will your children like it? Yes.
Will you have some explaining to do to the older ones? Yes.

3 stars because, when one decides to make an adaptation of the Bible they should stick to THE Script.",1218499200,11,1756,4.81

It had little things in the story that bothered me, that I really know are not bible based.

1377160,4,B00004YNUM,"""The Prince of Egypt"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I just love it to death. And when I saw ""Joseph: King of Dreams"", I simply had to purchase it, knowing it was made by the same people who made that wonderful first movie.

While ""King of Dreams"" is not nearly as dramatic and thrilling as ""Prince of Egypt"", and while the animation is not quite as excellent, I liked this movie nonetheless. I'm not sorry I bought it. It's still sweet--not as touching as its predecessor, but good in its own way.

The music is worth listening to, especially the song ""Better Than I"". And the actors are terrific. They really throw themselves into their characters, and I admire that.

So, although this movie could use a bit of improvement here and there, I would recommend it to anyone who's a religious person, and a lover of movies in general.",1198713600,,840,4.5131578947368425

1377162,4,B00004YNUM,"For a direct-to-video this wasn't half bad. I've always liked the Dreamworks style of animation that's sharp and more angular instead of the rounded, softer look from Disney characters. Dreamworks also avoids the fairy tale genre by choosing more provocative stories than can become very worthwhile if done properly. ""Joseph: King of Dreams"" is historically a prelude to ""Prince of Egypt"" but it successfully stands on its own. It has no need to capitalize on a blockbuster film with a ""sequel"".

The animation, while not on par with the computer-animated sea split from PoE, is still exquisite in detail. We see Egypt through the eyes of the startled Joseph who goes from a bustling slave market to the splendor of Potiphar's house to the dankness of a prison cell. Dreamworks is credited to thorough research on ancient civilizations and their lifestyles, seen from the finery of Egyptain garments and Joseph's hand painted mural--a nod to Moses hieroglyphic dream from PoE.

PoE is an epic tale about a nation's liberation while ""Joseph"" is a more personal story about one man's journey into the unknown world. It feels friendlier to families watching it at home and there's no freaky plagues to scare the kids either. My only complaint is the second half of the film that's inaccurate in text and feels too rushed. The brothers come to Egypt and Joseph gives them cold retribution until his good natured wife Asenath advises him otherwise. The sudden ""surprise"" discovery of new brother, Benjamin, is also incorrect. (Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin. He and Joseph grew up together until Joseph was sold into slavery.)

Nevertheless, it's nice film that you can show the family without worrying about crass content. Like PoE, the star-studded voice cast is adequate. Ben Affleck delivers a low key ""realistic"" voice for Joseph.  Mark Hamill is a worthwhile Judah (although all the brothers are depicted rather malevolently.)  The music is not on par with the original ""When You Believe"" score but it turns out all right. The highlight of the film is ""Better than I"", where the frustrated Joseph finds peace with himself after suffering much adversity.

1377163,5,B00004YNUM,"Other reviewers have suggested that the music of ""Joseph"" is not up to the standard of Prince of Egypt, but I beg to differ.  John Bucchino's lyrics and score ensure that this isn't just a bible story, but a well-told story of faith and personal growth.  I personally could only stand a single song in PoE, and that one only in the multiple-language version in the DVD extras...  Joseph's story, on the other hand, has thoughtfully crafted music that moves the tale along, rather than just relaying the story.

The fact that this is a Bible story is almost irrelevant, which makes this a far more compelling film.  With so many ""preachy"" offerings out there these days, it's refreshing to find something being presented as moral and spiritual, rather than simply religious.",1165104000,8,773,4.825757575757576

1377166,4,B00004YNUM,"Although it lacks the starpower and budget of its predecessor, ""Prince of Egypt,"" ""Joseph:  King of Dreams"" is a very ambitious film for the direct-to-DVD market.  It features the voice talents of Ben Affleck(Daredevil, Gigli), Mark Hamill(the Star Wars trilogy, Batman:  The Animated Series), James Eckhouse(Beverly Hills, 90210), Steven Weber(Wings), and Jodi Benson(Ariel of ""The Little Mermaid"").  It also features the voices of Dan Castellaneta, Maureen McGovern, Rene Auberjonois, Judith Light, and other established actors.

It tells the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors and how his father, Jacob, puts him on a pedestal above his other brothers.  When Joseph's bragging goes a little too far, his brothers sell him into slavery.  Little do they know that he will eventually become second only to Pharoah in power and literally hold their futures in his hands.  The story sticks relatively close to that of the Bible.  It handles the dreams that Joseph has and interprets in a very good manner.  They standout from the rest of the film without actually separating themselves from the overall story.

The music is sort of average, and not on the level of ""Prince,"" but it does move the story along at a decent clip.  The animation is also a step down from ""Prince,"" but the budget was also considerably smaller, so I'll let that pass.

Some have claimed that God is only mentioned once in this film.  However, if you follow the story and the actions of Joseph (especially when he is imprisoned), you'll see that God is everywhere in this film.  It is all left to interpretation, and if you don't look for God, you'll obviously not see him in this movie.

I highly recommend this story as a companion piece to ""Prince of Egypt.""  Although some may see it as a sequel, it's actually just another film based on a story from the Bible.  After viewing this flick, try reading the actual story to your children and see if they can pick out the differences and similarities between the real story and Dreamworks' version.

Please note that there is a little bit of violence in this film, but nothing along the lines of of ""Prince of Egypt.""  There is also a tad bit of sensuality when Potiphar's wife attempts to seduce Joseph, but this is handled quite nicely in the film and little ones will most likely not catch on to it.

A really good film with solid production and voice talent.  I highly recommend it.",1151020800,7,2419,4.764423076923077

A storyline that I already know most detail of didn't interest me either.  However, I got right into the story right when Rachel starts singing.  I never got so much submerged into the Prince of Egypt.

It's true that everything about the movie ""seemed"" mediocre and nothing striking.  I'm so surprised that the characters have top-notch animated facial expressions (the key to good characters), totally artistic backgrounds, great voices, and really touching songs (open the subtitles and look at the lyrics!)

I especially love Joseph's voice and animation, and didn't know it was Ben Affleck until the credits roll.  I even starts to think the characters are good-looking!

I was watching alone, so I had the freedom to cry all I want as so many scenes touched my heart.  There's so many times that I thought of god too, even though they don't keep saying god in the movie.  Maybe people who don't enjoy it didn't feel the warmth the movie carries through.

It is also wonderful entertainment for adults! It really is a timeless adventure for all ages .
It is different to Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat  , but just as good . The former being a light-hearted musical , and 'King of Dreams' being an educational and enchanting story.
Furthermore the criticism that God was left out of the story is simply untrue.
It is clear throughout the story that events are being moved by the hand of God.
When Pharaoh queries Joseph's power , Joseph makes it clear to Pharaoh that it is not his power at all but comes from God.
I loved the imagery , for example the use of birds signifying freedom and going far  during """"More Than You Take"" .
The film is a rollercoaster of emotions , a particularly poignant scene being when Joseph explains to his beautiful young wife Asinath , that the men who he is treating so badly are his brothers (earlier represented as a particularly nasty and sordid bunch) , who cruelly sold him into slavery .
Also pay attention to the small details. In the last scene when Jacob is welcomed by Joseph to Egypt , he is thrilled to see Joseph's two little sons .
Those who know there Bible know that they are , Ephraim and Manasseh who will become great leaders in their own right.

In this case many liberties have been taken in modifying the stories in the Bible to fit the plot of this movie. However, I think the spirit of the message remains intact. Joseph of course interprets dreams, and the dream sequences that DreamWorks chose to animate are clever and creative.
Critically, I think that the animation in this film is not as clear and intricate (in most cases) as in Price of Egypt; also the songs do not stick in your mind. There are not as many big stars in this movie either, although big stars don't always make great movies.

1377192,4,B00004YNUM,"The heartbreak of family divided and the power of family united.
According to DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, much of the creative team that was involved in ""THE PRINCE OF EGYPT"" was gathered to work on ""JOSEPH: KING OF DREAMS.""  Although the resulting, richly colored animation, often bathed in desert light, is not quite the eye-popping caliber of the former, it is certainly satisfying.
This is a vivid, thoughtful, sometimes insightful, retelling of the timeless, oft-told Biblical tale of a brother's betrayal and ironic revenge.
The story begins with a naive 17 year-old Hebrew boy who ends up a powerful and wise 34 year old lord of Egypt.  The sweeping tale takes us from Canaan to Egypt at the surge of its growth as an empire that ruled the world.  Yet it's the personal, intimate aspects that bring about the story's power and universality.
Ben Afflect creates an effective voice characterization that actually reflects the life-challenging experiences of Joseph.  The ensemble cast featurs the voice talents of mark Hamill, Judith Light, Maureen McGovern and Dan Castellaneta among others.
Nizo Yamamoto, who was art director on the stunning ""PRINCESS MONONOKE"" served as background supervisor.  He created a special technique to generate the gentle softness of some of the dusky desert vistas.  ""I use an airbrush and spray water over the painting and then use a huge brush to soften the whole thing,"" he says.  Over 500 artists from an international talent pool worked on this unusual project that was tweaked with break-through computer animation.  In fact, not a single frame of film was exposed -- the entire movie was finished digitally.
The score was composed and orchestrated by Dan Pelfrey.  John Bucchino wrote the songs.  In some ways, as in ""THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,"" the songs slow down the story telling and in fact take us out of the compelling story as adapted from the Bible by Eugenia and Raymond Singer.  The direction was shared by Rob  LaDuca and Rob Ramirez.
The DVD includes bonus features for the entiure family and all age groups from Sing-Along Songs to Storyboard Commentary to an Interactive Trivia Game and more.(DreamWorks, 74 minutes, Not Rated)",1009929600,,2184,5.069832402234637

(And it's deep enough that I have changed my opinion on something about him.) Next the music: It was just a tiny, tiny little bit behind that explosive first rate quality of Prince of Egypt. Wonderful music! But the graphics unfortunately did not keep step with it. They were good, but not stunning. Over all I think this is a good follow up.

POE is one of my favorite all time movies and Joseph is my favorite biblical character.  So you can imagine my delight when I heard that Dreamworks who had put out a masterpiece like POE was, developing the story of Joseph.  But when I sat down to watch the movie I was horrified.  It was a trite, sappy story and had none of the edge and solid characterizations of POE.
The makers of this movie could have gone a long way to show the growing up and the development of Joseph and his relation to his brothers.  The same way they showed the development of Moses and his relationship to his brother Ramses.  Joseph was a spoilt, pampered and favorite Daddy's boy.  Who practically provoked his brothers into selling him into slavery through his arrogance towards them and constant tattle telling.  Insted in JKOD everything is one dimensional.  Joseph is simply a saint who did nothing wrong and had no character flaws. Whereas his brothers were just plain bad. It really would have been nice if we could have seen Joseph change from an arrogant youth to humble and responsible man.
 I've listened to the POE soundtrack over and over again.  But with JKOD I was forced to press the mute button on the remote because I found the songs so irritating.
  Two favorible things.  The handling of the sexual harassment issue by Potiphars wife was tastefully done.  I also liked the way that Asenath was slipped into the story.

1377202,5,B00004YNUM,"I usually don't buy direct-to-video sequels -- usually, they are inferior to the original product and only tarnish my enjoyment. However, ""King of Dreams"" is not a sequel, rather than a companion piece.
Delving once again into ancient history, this story tells of a ""miracle child,"" the favorite son of old Jacob and his wife Rachel (the Biblical polygamy is delicately ignored, though hinted at in that Joseph is a half-brother). While Joseph's ten brothers toil in the fields, he is taught to read and write and is given a magnificently woven coat. When he has dreams that ""mean something,"" his brothers' resentment starts to grow. He ends up enslaved in Egypt, where despite his talents and intelligence he falls further and further. But newfound humility and a special gift from God will bring him back up.
This movie has a beautiful piece of symbolism - the little fruit tree that Joseph carelessly steps on as he cries out to God, ""Why?"" Everyone in their lives is faced with a crisis in which it is asked why God is doing this to them. The single leaf that remains living on the shattered tree shows how his faith still exists, and that faith grows as he saves the tree and nurtures it to health. God is spoken of less, as Joseph is not convincing anyone of anything, but his presence is highly felt in the writing.
From a secular point of view, this is also a good cautionary tale. At the beginning, Joseph bounds past his brothers, singing, ""I am special, I am smart! I am a miracle child!"" and being coddled by his parents. Allowing himself to be arrogant is part of his downfall. Later on, he uses his gift and his intelligence to benefit everyone, and thus is rewarded.
The secondary characters are, like Ramses of PoE, multi-dimensional even if you are supposed to dislike them. As Joseph enjoys his special status, one can sympathize with his jealous brothers -- but the same spoiled boy will take your sympathy when his brothers taunt him and cruelly sell him. Potiphar is well-drawn -- a man who betrays his own honor and clearly suffers inwardly because of it, and his niece is an instantly sympathetic character is her urgings to forgive.
Though this film is acceptable for small kids, there are a few moments that will disturb them, such as when Potiphar's wife makes a (it's not obvious to the very young) pass at Joseph, and when he is dragged off while his brothers accept silver as payment for him.
The songs aren't quite as good as PoE, but the animation in its lesser glory is excellent. When Joseph is led into Egypt, one can definitely sympathize with his slack-jawed awe. Lesser details, such as Potiphar's servant's thoughts on Joseph's hygiene, are also present and very enjoyable. The dream sequences strike a good balance of otherworldliness and realism.
Okay, so this isn't quite up to the standards of ""Prince of Egypt."" There's a lesser budget, but it's a more personal, family story.",978307200,32,2919,4.714285714285714
1377203,4,B00004YNUM,"This worthy companion piece to Dreamworks' ""Prince of Egypt"" retells the Biblical story of Joseph, his betrayal by his brothers, sale into slavery, imprisonment, then rise to prominence through God's gift of prophecy through dreams. The story is well-voiced by stars including Judith Light, Mark Hamill, and Ben Affleck as Joseph, despite some weak, Disneyfied songs (voiced by the normally reliable Maureen McGovern and Jodi ""Ariel"" Benson).
""Joseph""'s dream and flashback sequences are well-animated, with images of sunflowers, flowing wheatfields and flying eagles referencing Joseph's growth(in status and wisdom)in Egypt. This is notable where Joseph visions his brothers mocking him while cleaning a palace floor, then flashbacks to his youth while caring for a tree in his prison cell.
Like all great Biblical stories, ""Joseph"" works as love lesson (in forgiveness and personal growth here) and dramatic narrative, and is economically told on both accounts. The film accurately captures Joseph's contentious relationship with his old and new families; the story's dramatic parallels (his false imprisonment by and reproachment with Portiphar, then the suspenseful-turned-joyous reunion with his brothers where Joseph reveals his identity) are powerful. While some dramatic license was taken with the storyline, ""Joseph"" thankfully eschews Disney-esque asides, superflous fantasy characters or expanded romantic angles (Joseph's love and marriage to Asenath is simply part of the story).
""Joseph"" was and remains among the Old Testament's most engrossing stories, particularly to families susceptible to sibling rivalry. Despite occassional melodramatic lapses, ""Joseph"" retains that core story and is an exceptional family film with much to teach its viewers. Recommended.",978048000,32,1779,5.926070038910506

God is only mentioned in one place in the whole movie - in a song where Joseph reflects on how he needs to trust that God has a plan for his life. Without God, the greater theme of Joseph's life is missing, making this a story with no point (it also makes it hard to understand why things happened the way they did).
