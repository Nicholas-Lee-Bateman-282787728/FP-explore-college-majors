8124419,4,B000FKPDUM,"2 Become 1 is a quirky movie centering around Bingo, a young woman who discovers she has breast cancer and may have to lose one of her breasts. The story is plain, but never dull, with a lot of comedic and light touches to carry it along.

Bingo's reactions to both her cancer and the situations that come up around her as life continues to move on were all very convincing. She experiences a lot of hardship in both accepting she has cancer and re-evaluating her life because of it, and her responses stayed very realistic throughout the whole movie.

Thankfully, even though this movie clearly had A LOT of space to become sappy and emotionally manipulative, it never stoops that low. You won't sit through any moments knowing your heartstrings are being deliberately tugged at. It's actually surprising light (but not frivolous!) for most of the movie. So in the end it's emotionally spot on.

The only negative would be that you're probably not going to find yourself in a rush to watch it again as it's not an especially standout type of film. It's very competently made and a pleasure to watch the first time anyway. I would give it a 3 1/2 rather than the full 4 stars for this reason, but since halves aren't an option and I did like watching the movie, I rounded the score up.",1379894400,,1285,4.530172413793103
