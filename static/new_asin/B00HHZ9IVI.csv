8632958,5,B00HHZ9IVI,"Universal fears of claustrophobic spaces and things that lurk in the dark combined with a breathless pace and terrifying monsters make Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT the scariest thing I've seen in a long time.

In it, six young female adventurers go on a spelunking expedition into an uncharted North Carolina cavern where an ancient race of sightless cannibals that are perfectly adapted to the dark hunt them down one by one. The personal stories of all half-dozen become irrelevant to their futile struggle for survival.

Be advised that ""Descent"" contains dozens of f-wrds and is ber gory stuff!
