Special footnote, Peer Gynt is a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. It was written in 1867, and first performed in Oslo (then called Christiania) on 24 February 1876, with incidental music by the composer Edvard Grieg. Ibsen wrote Peer Gynt while traveling in Rome, on Ischia and in Sorrento. It was first published on November 14, 1867, in Copenhagen. The first edition comprised 1,250 copies. It was followed by a re-print of 2,000 copies after 14 days. The large sales were mostly due to the success of Ibsen's previous play, Brand. Unlike Ibsen's other later plays, Peer Gynt is written in verse. This is because it was originally intended to be a written drama, not for stage performance. Difficulties due to rapid and frequent change of scene (including an entire act in pitch darkness) render the play troublesome to perform. It is also unlike Ibsen's later plays in that it is a fantasy rather than a realistic tragedy ... (as noted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).

8164808,4,B000LXGXXY,"This must be understood for what it is - an amateur, black & white silent production.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was delightful to see a Very young Heston - at 17, quite handsome, and his later acting chops were well on their way.  The story was somewhat difficult to follow, esp. at the beginning, because the ""mother"" was performed by a teenage girl! - with less than Hollywood-skilled makeup made it confusing to know who she was).  (Peer Gynt is an involved story anyway, and I would suggest reading a synopsis somewhere else before watching this, to get the full benefit.) The music was Great - appropriately, by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg - ""Peer Gynt"" - with its recurring themes throughout, such as the very lovely ""Solveigs Sng.""  Very possibly, the music was added in later years(?) - in any case, it added tremendously to the viewing experience.  The photography was (mostly) good. That is, in good shape, and nicely done.  I cannot help but wonder if the beginning was actually filmed by the youthful director on a family trip to Norway!  Otherwise, it was done in and around Wisconsin and Michigan, with decent enough costumery - and yes, there Are sand dunes, located on the eastern Lake Michigan shoreline!  (even if the ""palm trees"" are a bit hokey).  Again - taking in consideration the age of the participants, the director and main characters - this deserves a very delightful 4 stars.",1489622400,,1426,4.783673469387755

I enjoyed it... but Peer as a character leaves something to be desired.  Peer is rude to his mother, trashes a girl who chases him (he wasn't into her), and also makes a mess of a relationship with a lovely woman who loves him... Gee... sounds like a guy who doesn't value women very much.  He does get his ""come-up-ance"" in the film.  But it won't be high on my list of things to watch over and over again.
The pluses:  the music, seeing the music with the story, the main character gets his ""reward"" and the other saving grace in the film is watching Charlton Heston before he had his ""big break"".",1425254400,,768,4.162162162162162

In fact, I like all of Ibsen's plays, so you could say I'm an Ibsenophile (but then I'm Danish and Norwegian - so I'm biased).  This silent version was okay, but remember it is a play in verse so I don't think it translates well to the silent screen.  It's like  watching Macbeth or Hamlet on the silent screen.  You miss the richness of the language even in translation.  This film may not appeal to most people - in fact after having seen it I most likely won't view it again.",1376524800,,592,4.27027027027027

CHUCK HESTON:
THE MAYONNAISE GRIMACE (PLAYING THE PRIZED PEER GYNT FLICK)

By John M. Edwards

Charleton Heston, the Hollywood hero favored by John M. Edwards, got his start in an amateur Illinois art student prod, the fantastical ""PEER GYNT,"" based upon the classical opera by Norwegian composer Grieg.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------When I saw German director Fritz Lang's M for the first time, when ghoulish Peter Lorre absolutely stunned the cameras by apparently (perhaps apocryphally) proving himself innocent of luring children with lollipops toward their deaths, in front of an angry vigilante mob, stopped by a last-second police raid, with a soliloquy worthy of Charleton Heston in Soylent Green--(""Soylent Green is PEOPLE!)--I said wow!

Who be this powerful brooding song (note: the consuetidinal ""be""). It was almost as cool as Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" (featured in either Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon flicks).

The unforgettably imaginative tune I later found out was called ""In the Halls of Mountain Kings,"" based, of course, on Old Norse loegend, by the underrated (during his life, at least) Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg.

First alerted to Charleton Heston's epic bildungsroman debut--canned when he was roughly seventeen years old--by reading Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine (very influential),and owned and operated by Hugo-Award-Winning Number-One-Fan Forrest J. Ackerman, PEER GYNT is fabled fantasy at its finest. (As a childhood expert on the genre, I once visited Forry at his Beverly Hills manse in the shadows of the ""House on Haunted Hills"" set, whose secretary said, ""Can I call you a cab?"" Yes. ""Okay, you're a cab!"")

Anyway, never have I seen an actor more confident that he would soon be a major star, this is, I'm afraid, called Destiny, a quest indeed worthy of an Olympian Odysseus Zeus, not a Hollywood gossip like cuckoo Rona Barrett.

I won't give away what this rare film is about that seemed unavailable back in the days of collectible but ultimately useless Super 8, but there is one ""Sheltering Sky""-like scene on a foreign feast on the beach, among legionnaires trying to trick Charleton, that ranks among the most comic scenes in human history, grinning and mugging for the cameras like I don't know what.

So chuck ""Chuck"" in your Amazon.com right this triple sec. In some ways, the film is almost as powerful as the pounding fist of Taylor seeing Lady Liberty half buried in sand: ""My God, they finally did it, they blew up the world!""

Incidentally, I was in the Charleton Heston Fan Club, and received a nice autographed photo of Charleton in ""Midway,"" also worth buying.

8164814,5,B000LXGXXY,"Easily the best zero-budget, amateur film I have ever watched.

The photography is quite nice. The director and cameramen were obviously learning their craft, and doing very well. Lighting is very good. There are very few gratuitous camera moves, and no active zooming (they probably could not afford a zoom lens.) Some of the camera moves are quite effective, although, obviously hand-held.

The amateur acting is largely cornball, but, some performances show promising talent. Of course Heston shows great potential. Betty Hanisee plays Aase, Peer's mother, with energy and expression. Betty Barton does a really commendable Ingrid, with a range of believable emotions from pitiful begging to deep anger and resentment. Well done! Katherine Bradley's part (Solveig) was a little sappy, but she carries it off without cracking, which I would find very hard to do.

Given that the budget was undoubtedly zero, it is understandable that Bradley should make it a silent film. I have a feeling that recording dialogue would have lowered the overall quality, so I don't fault him for it. The music is not the best recording quality, though, perhaps, the best available at the time. The script follows the play fairly closely, although Peer doesn't make it to the Cairo asylum in this version. The rest of the major plot elements and much of the dialogue are correct. I am a silent film fan, so I am not disturbed by the the dialogue cards. You can also clearly read the actors' lips.

The one weak spot that I found disappointing was the Boyg. I think this was one of the bits added in 1964. It is the only item with sound and this special effect clearly exceeds the zero budget. It breaks the flow of the rest of the film. I wonder what the original scene was like. There are several large-scale location shots that are obviously lifted from other films. These add to the story telling, but are discontinuous with the amateur production values. The DVD conversion is not quiet top drawer, but adequate.

The viewer must try to keep in mind the limitations under which Bradley made this Peer Gynt. Within that scope, it is really quite excellent. I would highly recommend it to film history buffs, Hestonites, and film students. Just do not buy it expecting a Technicolor, Panavision, epic production. Take it for what it claims to be, and you will, I think, be pleased.",1270512000,10,2366,4.846534653465347
