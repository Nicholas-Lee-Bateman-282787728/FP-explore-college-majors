554689,5,630309189X,"This is the most important documentary ever done on ancient Egypt, and Egyptologists have done the best they can to ignore it over the past ten years.  Geologist Robert Schoch and 'maverick' Egyptologist John Anthony West show that the weathering on the Sphinx is due to rain, not sand, wind, or the flooding of the Nile, as has always been suggested.  When did the Sahara desert ever receive such measurable rainfall?  Ten thousand years ago, when it was a lush green valley.  The consequences of this revelation are devastating and it's almost comical to watch the most famous Egyptologists,  Hawass and, Lehner stumble to argue the case against the disclosure on this video because, if it was accepted as true, all they have thought will have been a lie.  To th eir credit, the makers of the video gave both sides a fair chance to state their case, as opposed to most traditional documentaries on Egypt, which are simply video travel brochures about  the pyramids and the mummies.  The fact is, that everything that we have told about the rise and development about Egyptian civilization is wrong, and with that, everything we believe about the rise of civilization is wrong, too.  Egyptologists have a different version of events, one often unsupported by other sciences, but, once you watch this video, you will hold everything they say to a higher standard.  One would have liked to see a more updated version of this video, to find out what has happened with the secret chamber discovered beneath the Sphinx's paw (the lost hall of records perhaps?), but, as of recently, the Egyptian arheologists have either not been inclined to investigate, or, at least, tell the world of the results.
To put in a pleas for poor Richard Hoagland, who one reviewer has trashed:  the face o n Mars has not been inconclusively proved to be a trick of light and shadow.  Depending upon who you talk to, the jury is still out on that one, but  that is another story and he and others can explain it  better.  In any event, that part has little to do with the rest of this work..",1062288000,10,2067,4.686980609418282
554690,4,630309189X,"Schoch and West build an overwhelming case for the great antiquity of the Sphinx, predating the other monuments of Giza.  I highly recommend this video, and even moreso Schoch's book ""Voices of the Rocks"".  Another book (orig 1986/87, but out in a Jan 2000 edition) that will be of  interest is ""Plato, Prehistorian"" by Mary Settegast.  Schoch  mentions it in his book, and I sought out the old edition in a local  library.
The only problem with this video is the segment near the end  featuring Richard Hoagland.  Even that was good for some laughs.  In his  defense, the ""Face on Mars"" used to exist, but only as an  artifact of the Viking orbiter cameras' resolution.  The Pathfinder data  wasn't available when this show was produced.  OTOH, Hoagland hasn't  abandoned his mistaken conclusion in the face of the better data.",956016000,7,828,4.814285714285714
554691,5,630309189X,"The Mystery of the Sphinx contains information about the Sphinx, and Egyptian history and archaeology in general, that is nothing less than explosive. John Anthony West and Robert Schoch offer brilliant and  convincing evidence that the Sphinx is much older than the pyramids,  possible as much as 8,000 years older than previously thought, indicating  that our understanding of Egyptian history and religion has barely  scratched the surface. Their convincing testimony is made all the more  interesting and entertaining by the inclusion of Charlton Heston as the  narrator. And this video is not merely a visual montage of Egyptian images  overlaid with mystical sounding rhetoric. This is real science and real  history - and maverick archaeology at its best.",915580800,14,762,5.398305084745763

7836759,5,630309189X,"I enjoyed every minute of this video because of all the research that was put into it. There is no doubt the Great Sphinx is a mystery and I liked that they presented different views from top archeologists, geologists, and researchers. Very informative and a must watch for an Egypt nerd like me :)",1357689600,,298,4.537037037037037
7836760,5,630309189X,"Since I saw the original airing of this documentary on NBC television network on November 10, 1993 I feel I'm qualified to comment.  As much as I did enjoy the presentation of new opinions, the mystery of the Sphinx still remained.  I was never convinced by the prevailing view that the Sphinx represented Pharaoh Khafre. So the best and most conclusive segment was when NYPD sketch artist Frank Domingo showed using his expertise that the accepted creator of the Sphinx was NOT Pharaoh Khafre.

I just finished reading an article in the February 2010 issue of SMITHSONIAN, which I had put aside to read ""later""!  The article is titled ""UNCOVERING SECRETS OF THE SPHINX"" by Evan Hadingham, senior science editor of the PBS series ""Nova"", and it's based on Mark Lehner's research.

As I read the article I was looking for views that reflected both sides of the argument but found none.  I remembered Domingo and had hoped his breakthrough work was going to be included.  Then, a few moments ago, I started researching the documentary ""The Mystery of the Sphinx"" and saw the review by D. Hill (Blows the doors off all Egyptogology... August 31, 2003) and had a quiet laugh as I read his comments about Hawass and Lehner.

Through the years I have found out that highly educated professionals in various fields are so full of themselves that common sense, reason and logic are not in their consciousness.  Respected Lehner is one of them.  And just think how many impressionable minds are being affected in a negative way about how to perform proper research and most important, how to keep an open mind and entertain more than one point of view.

I love this documentary and it should be considered as a reference source.",1353715200,,1719,4.754208754208754
7836761,4,630309189X,"I remembered this from the original TV showing, and was looking forward to getting a copy.  The material is well presented may have been what staeted me questioning just where our accepted ""facts"" actually come from.  The nearest answer I've been able to find so far is that a self-selected assortment of men about a hundred years ago decided  these things  and successful student were the ones who kept repeating them.",1351296000,,419,4.859154929577465
7836762,4,630309189X,"This DVD edition contains the expanded edition -- the NBC broadcast, plus additional footage not aired.  Somewhere around here I have both editions on VHS, but rather than an extensive comparison of the differences between the editions, this review will concentrate on the contents of this one.

This video presents the views of John Anthony West and Dr. Robert M. Schoch vis a vis the dating of the Great Sphinx of Giza, along with three critics of that view, as well as some waldorf salads on the side, if you get my meaning.

The video is well produced, the transfer to DVD was well done, and this extended version is divided into bands which are handy ways to skip the irrelevant or distasteful.  Charleton Heston does a creditable job as narrator and host, part of the time with a bit of a twinkle in his eye.

The story unfolds.  West's discovery is described, then West himself tells how he found he was on the right track, and searched for a geologist who would actually study the problem at the site and then publicly state his findings.  That geologist turned out to be Dr. Robert M. Schoch.  Step by step they build their case, using the geology of the Sphinx and environs, as well as the mudbrick monuments at Saqqara (which I think had just been reopened to the public at the time this was filmed), the Inventory Stele, the Dream Stele, NYPD forensics, paleoclimatology, and a seismic experiment permitted by the Egyptian Antiquities Authority.  The late Boris Said, who was involved in the production, can be seen swinging the sledgehammer, and later bonking a chunk of broken obelisk.

There's a decent amount of footage of James F. Romano (who died untimely at age 56, in 2003, years after this was filmed), in which he makes some good sound bytes, but also heaps abuse on the whole idea of a predynastic Sphinx.  At one point his words are used to help make the case, which I found amusing -- he states that the idea that Egyptian sculpture is perfectly symmetrical is ""absolutely wrong"", and that the Egyptians noticed subtle differences in the real and included them in their images.  This is followed by a comparison between a known likeness of Khafre and the head of the Sphinx and how they don't match.  I love that part.

James J. Hurtak has a few brief appearances, none of which detract much from the program, and in fact add some humor.  If you take James J. Hurtak seriously in this, I'm just glad I don't know you.  He isn't credited on the DVD box as being a member of The Scientific Team (those names are West, Schoch, Dr. Thomas Dobecki, Professor John Kutback, and Detective Frank Domingo), for which I'm thankful.  Hurtak may have originated the notion that there are artificial structures on Mars, a view he has promulgated since circa 1971.

Richard Hoagland has an easy-to-skip band near the end of this edition.  West does an intro, seeming to give his imprimatur to what Hoagland is about to say.  Much of this footage is from Hoagland's talk at the UN building (he didn't appear there under UN or any other official auspices, and his Angstrom Medal has all the significance of a casino poker chip).  Hoagland first states that the ""Face on Mars"" has 95 per cent symmetry, then shows that each half, when mirrored against itself, yields a different image -- which means, to any reasonable person, that there isn't any symmetry at all.  It's a heads-he-wins-tails-we-lose kind of approach.  I am mystified as to where the money comes from to support such a cockeyed delusional system.

The Face on Mars was an artifact -- an artifact of the low resolution of the Viking orbiter's cameras.  The original images of the Face consist of about three dozen pixels each.  The newer (1990s) images of Cydonia show what most people already figured -- that the ""Face"" is just an unremarkable, natural formation.  More to the point, the so-called Monuments of Mars don't have any bearing on the Great Sphinx of Giza.  The silly detour into this [...] is a detriment to the entire presentation.  This is easily skipped, or may even produce no little amusement.  It should not create an impediment to your purchase and enjoyment of this disk.

West can be amusing (his reference in this video to ""smart old us with our hydrogen bombs and striped toothpaste"" for example), but on his website sometimes comes off as childish and hostile.  This video appears to be West at his best.

Schoch's final words in this video include his opposition to the idea that extraterrestrials had anything to do with the Sphinx.  He has made his case for water erosion and a predynastic date for the Sphinx, while only (and wisely) following West up to a point.  Although it is mentioned a few times, I didn't think that enough emphasis was given to the obvious fact that the head has been recarved.  In any case, I recommend this video to adults who will watch carefully, as well as children, provided their viewing of it is supervised.",1177545600,7,4942,4.6859791425260715

The information presented in this program is based on the seventeen years of research of an Egyptologist and a geologist.  It is hosted by the legendary Charlton Heston.

Experts of what is called ""The Sphinx Project"" (five people make up this ""scientific team"") re-examine the Great Sphinx of Egypt.  They show that what orthodox Egyptologists claim about the Sphinx cannot be true.  Experts other than those of the Sphinx project also give brief comments.  There are even rebuttals by opposing experts as to what is claimed by the Sphinx project.

Areas covered in this program include archaeology, Egyptology, geology, mathematics, seismology, paleoclimatology, engineering, and even forensics.  All scientific concepts are explained with the aid of computer simulation and animation.

To see how all this new information presented fits together, there is a fantastic computer graphic sequence near the end of the program to illustrate the possible life history of the Sphinx.

Here are some of the questions answered about the Sphinx:

(1) Is the Sphinx older than thought?

(2) How were the huge 200 ton blocks used to build it put in place?

(3) Is there more to the Sphinx than can be seen?

(4) Is the face of the Sphinx really who it is thought?

(5) Is the head of it really the original head?

In this program, there is no mention of UFOs or LGM (little green men).  This program presents a serious scientific investigation.

The DVD itself is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are no extras.

Finally, to determine what the Sphinx is staring at, I recommend viewing the excellent video ""Heaven's Mirror"" (1998) hosted by Graham Hancock.

In conclusion, this program answers mysteries about the Sphinx.  If you're like me and like mysteries, then you can't miss this program!!
