831939,4,6304279000,"A Very Brady Sequel is a funny spoof of the shows premeired on television in the 70's.  It features the bradys living in the 90's, but stuck in the 70's.  Such as when a soliciter calls up offering the family cable service,  Mr. Brady says: ""So, you're saying I can connect a wire to my TV and  in will come 50 channels? I don't think so, good bye."" The main event  of the movie is when Mrs. Brady's old husband comes back.  Really, he is an  imposter but the bradys do not notice.  When he whisks Mrs. Brady off to  Hawaii, Mr. Brady decides to teach him a lesson on kindness. This is a  funny movie and good entertainment.",943747200,2,624,4.168067226890757

832263,4,6304279000,"Having been made in the 90s it's a bit odd--it's a 90s take on the 70s and now viewed by people in 2000s. I loved watching the Brady Bunch on TV Land as a kid and found that the humor in the first one did a good job both poking fun at and celebrating what we loved about the show. The sequel I think did a good job also and upped the ante on making more adult jokes/observations--such as alluding to secret sexual tension between Greg and Marsha (cleaner minds I guess in the 70s about two teens who are not biologically not related sharing an antic space, right?). Overall, I think it's a fun, don't have to think kind of movie. Also gotta love working in the Hawaii Bound story-lines and other allusions they made from the source material..",1484870400,,742,4.307142857142857

832265,4,6304279000,"Strange, I ordered this movie and instead of what is pictured, I got ""A Brady Bunch of Movies: 4 Groovy Films"" a multi 4 disc dvd case with 4 brady bunch movies. It contains The Brady Bunch Movie, A Very Brady Sequel, The Brady Bunch In the Whitehouse, and Growing up Brady.
I'm not complaining, but a strange glitch indeed.

832519,4,6304279000,"It's the Brady Bunch, what's not to like. The original tv series kind of hit a nerve for those of us wishing our blended families would work out and the kids would actually listen to our sappy advice.

832525,3,6304279000,Seldom is the sequel as good as the original and that is true here.  If your goal is just to get a dose of the feel you got when watching the first Brady movie then this does the trick.  But it is basically the same fish out of water + nostalgia for the original series that the first movie captured so well but moved to a new setting.,1445644800,,335,3.911764705882353

832612,5,6304279000,"This follow up to The Brady Bunch Movie is possibly funnier than the original. The actors are clearly enjoying their roles. The performances have moved from fun parody to something much better. Gary Cole and Shelly Long were born for the roles of Mike and Carol. Their interactions and use of double entendre are one of many highlights of this very funny comedy. The subplot between Greg and Marcia is also delightfully twisted.

If you grew up watching the Brady bunch on TV, you will enjoy walking down this skewed version of memory lane.

I would highly recommend the Very Brady Sequel.",1444262400,,589,4.764705882352941

Even my teenaged kids who haven't seen the series, were rolling on the floor, mostly at the whole Jan-Marsha dynamic and the hilarious lines and acting by those two actors.  Gary Cole is great too as always (if you loved him in Office Space and Talladegha Nights you know what I mean).  For those reviewers who just didn't get it, all I can figure is that they either don't understand parody, haven't seen the original series, or just lack a sense of humor.  I think that like others, we liked the sequel even better.  In both movies, the casting could not have been more perfect and the character portrayals are spot-on by every single one of the actors.  But the actor playing Jan clearly steals the show in both of these (whatever happened to her?)  Yes it's cheesy but so was the original series, and we just haven't laughed this hard in a movie in a long time.  It's also refreshing to find a comedy without swearing and sex that you can watch and enjoy with your (older) kids.  But mostly I'm giving it 5 stars for the outstanding comedic performances by the cast. Wish they had made a third!",1438732800,5,1216,4.46606334841629

It requires almost no thought, no analysis, and no higher function reasoning to watch. I actually felt IQ points slipping away while watching it. The plot is thin, predictable, and somewhat like spending an hour and a half with the guy in the office that frequently asks you, ""Soooo...working hard, or hardly working?"" The director spares no opportunity to treat the viewers as if they were on heavy doses of Thorazine. The over-the-top acting will leave your mind pleasantly numb and useless for many hours afterwards. This movie may, in fact, be a suitable substitute for Thorazine.
With that said...it also offers a satirical, yet nostalgic escape from reality. Back to a glimpse of the TV show we may, or may not have, enjoyed in our youth.

834996,5,6304279000,"After the great success of ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" in 1995 the producers didn't waste time in offering a sequel the very next year that's even better. Both films poke fun at the Brady family's wholesome and unified spirit, but also highlight their early-70's outlandishness by having the stories take place in the mid-90s.

I'm giving ""A Very Brady Sequel"" a fairly high grade because it's funny and entertaining from beginning to end. All the cast and guest stars are great, including the villain played by Tim Matheson. Christine Taylor stands out as Marcia, although it's impossible to ever out-do the awesome Maureen McCormick. The funniest subplot is the sudden infatuation between Greg and Marcia (when it dawns on them that they're not REALLY brother and sister and...) while one of the best sequences is the public pool scene, embellished by black versions of Jan and Marcia, lol.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Santa Monica & Los Angeles, CA, and Hawaii.

The whole movie is just really fun and as a child growing up in the latter part of the 70's, I can remember the clothing and assorted references to that era.  Jan has always been my favorite.  Well as luck would have it, I found that old VHS tape and wouldn't you know it, the VCR is broke.  Well my daughter is 10 now and still has fond memories of that time when it was just us two and that movie.  She can't wait to see it again real soon.

835532,4,6304279000,"I adored the first `Brady Bunch' movie.  I was such a huge fan of the show (reruns) as a child and to watch the sitcom get ripped apart in such a respectful way (you can tell that they wanted to honor the films ridiculousness as apposed to trash it) gave me such a warm and fuzzy feeling all over.  What is nice about this `Brady Bunch' sequel is that it builds off the same scenario, trapping the Brady's in a time warp where there brand of style and general life keeps them segregated from the rest of society, and in doing this they have set themselves up for ample laughs.  What is sad at the same time though is that a lot of the laughs seem repetitive, as if we've seen this once before.

The film follows the Brady's as they are faced with a wrench in their tightly knit family circle.  Yes, a man shows up at their front door claiming to be Carol's long presumed dead husband Roy Martin.  Roy is actually Trevor, an imposter wanting to get his hands on a priceless artifact that Roy gave to Carol before he disappeared.  The Brady's are oblivious to this though, and their lovely home begins to crumble as this man begins to take root in their lives.

The real story though is taking place in the attic, where Greg and Marcia find themselves rooming together.  Finally realizing that they aren't technically brother and sister their attraction to one another starts burning a whole in their conscience for it just seems so wrong yet feels so right.

Thanks to the spot on acting done on the part of the entire Brady clan (Long, Cole, Taylor, Barnes, Cox, Sutera, Hack & Soffer) not to mention the witty script that keeps fresh in mind all the reasons we loved and or hated the inspiration, `A Very Brady Sequel' serves up some very worthy laughs.  Christine Taylor (who honestly should have received an Oscar nomination for her performance in `The Brady Bunch Movie') is not necessarily best-in-show here, her performance being upstaged by actors such as Jennifer Elise Cox, who does an extraordinary Jan.

Like I mentioned on the outset, the film does seem a bit repetitious at times, and the original was funnier in my opinion (maybe because it felt so much fresher).  I wasn't too thrilled about the throwbacks to other popular sitcoms (`I Dream of Genie' and `Gilligan's Island') being littered into the script, although the `Gilligan' riff was pretty funny.  The plot involving Carol's husband was a bit of a stretch, but it served its purpose in giving this sequel a purpose.  In the end it delivered the laughs and was consistent so I'd recommend it, but I won't say that it was better than the first because the first was almost too good to be true.",1221609600,3,2665,4.546025104602511
835533,5,6304279000,"Another of the rare breed of sequels-better-than-the-original movies, A Very Brady Sequel continues with the idea of the 70's Brady's being stuck in the present (in this case, the mid-90's) from the first film. While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole.

This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures.

The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new ""incest"" angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia (""Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?"") that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up ""tripping with the Bradys"".

While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one.

As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie. If you've never watched the Bradys then you'll probably want to skip these movies as most of the laughs are derived from inside references to the episodes, but if you have, then this is highly recommended and one of my faves.",1191369600,15,1824,4.744479495268139
835534,3,6304279000,"Pretty funny film, I must admit. One of the best scenes is on the plane to Hawaii when Greg (Johnny Bravo)Brady picks up his guitar & breaks out into a song. In another five seconds, the passengers would have handed him a parachute & shown him to the emergency exit.

True, the critics trashed this film, but hey..this IS a Brady Bunch movie, not 'Citizen Kane.' It's not something you watch for social commentary.",1188000000,21,414,4.594594594594595

Greg and Marcia discovering each other in ways brothers and sisters shouldn't.

835536,4,6304279000,"I'd been trying to track down this hilarious sequel for a long time and randomly found it marked down to $5.50 at Target last week. A fan of the first one, but I have to say the sequel's even funnier. I'm not sure why. Maybe because of the scene with Alice and Roy (Tim Matheson) when Alice puts the mushrooms she finds in his bag in his dinner and he completely trips out. Whatever the case, pure cheesy entertainment awaits you with A Very Brady Sequel. Just like in the first one, the world has changed all around the Brady's, but the Brady's are very much the same. In this movie however, Carol's supposedly deceased husband Roy comes back into their lives, explaining that he didn't die in his archaeological adventures a few years back and had been hanging on to the hope that his wife Carol and their daughters, Cindy, Jan & Marsha would be there waiting for him. But Roy isn't who he seems...he's really Roy's evil assistant using Roy's name after his death to get to this horse statue the real Roy sent to Carol for safekeeping before he died. ""Roy"" is just out to get this horse, worth millions of dollars. The Brady's initially welcome him in, as per grand Brady tradition. But soon they find out there's more to ""Roy"" than they thought. The whole movie is just plain silly, but great because of that. If you enjoyed making fun of the Brady's as you grew up and you're in need of mindless entertainment, this sequel is for you.

However this film along with the one that precedes it demonstate the perfect genius of it's creator and actors. The Brady Bunch was dumb, so let's make fun of it!!! Christopher Barnes as Greg deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Gary Cole for best actor. We all knew that Grag and Marsha always wanted to be more than brother and sister and thank God this film gets it out in the open.

835540,5,6304279000,"I can't believe there are others out there who ""get"" this movie! Everyone thinks my sister and I are crazy, but we watch this one and just howl-- it gets better with each viewing! There are big laughs and little things you may miss the first go-round-- like when Alice is mixing up a big bowl of meatloaf; just raw beef and lard at this stage, and along comes Mr. Brady to try to sample a swipe! She slaps his hand and says in that classic Alice way, ""Mr. Brady!"" Who in the world (except a Brady, maybe) would try to sneak a fingerful of raw beef-n-lard as if it were cake batter or cookie dough? Oh, may the hilarity ensue.
 I think this one is WAY better than the original, which had its moments but wasn't as much fun. I don't agree with the other reviewers on the last scene, though; I found Barbara Eden's cameo annoying. Clever I guess, but still annoying-- though, yes, she looks darned good for her age.
 Also, skip the tv movie where Mr. Brady runs for president. Though the wonderful Gary Cole (delicious even in his poodle wig) and Shelley Long return, none of the kids do, and that's a crying shame. Christopher Barnes' eyebrows alone out-acted the replacements.
 This go-round also has a really inspired premise, and it makes you wonder, whatever did happen to Mike and Carol's former spouses? The series may have told us, but I certainly don't remember. And this movie reminds us too that, though they blended well as a family, and though everyone took the name Brady, the kids are stepsiblings, after all.
 So, for my money, there's no Brady movie anywhere (original series actors or otherwise) that can beat the spoofy fun of this sequel! Only one problem: where are the extras? Neither Brady 1 nor this sequel includes any.",1090281600,3,1741,4.535031847133758
835625,5,6304279000,"This is probably one of my favorite comedies of all-time. Is it corny? Definitely. So it might take a certain kind of person to enjoy it. Like the first movie, the Bradys are living in the 90's yet them themselves seem to be trapped in the 70's unaware of how bizarre they seem. In this one, Carol's supposed first husband Roy suddenly shows up at the unsuspecting Brady's. Yet meanwhile, as in the first one, each family member is having their own private dramas. Greg and Marsha are attracted to each other, Jan is involved with an imaginary boyfriend, Cindy lost her doll, etc. Shelly Long is great as Carol and Alice does a great job too, but I think Jan steals the show. She's hillarious. So, if you like corny comedy, you can't go wrong with this.",1050451200,3,753,4.463768115942029
835626,4,6304279000,"From the amazing success of it's predecessor, it wasn't long before a sequel emerged. A VERY BRADY SEQUEL still proves to be hilarious if not better than the original. The sequel delves deeper into the Brady theme.  Sexual tabboes are explored such as the idea that went through all our heads at one stage- is it possible for Greg and Marcia to have a relationship.  The sexual tension between the two is hilarious and leaves us with a will they won't they idea which of course keeps the movie interesting. Unlike the first, the sequel introduces corny 70's expressions such as 'outta sight...neato..' which sound incredibly stupid yet funny at the same time.
Again,the plot proves to be fairly mundane yet it doesn't seem to matter.  Carol's supposed ex husband returns to be re-united with her and her childred.  However, what this conman really wants is a priceless horse sculpture worth a lot of money.  Can the Brady's foil the imposter and stop him?

835627,4,6304279000,"""A Very Brady Sequel,"" directed by Arlene Sanford, continues the comic adventures of the recast Brady clan (headed by Shelley Long as Carol and Gary Cole as Mike). Like the preceding film, this is a campy but affectionate riff on the original ""Brady Bunch"" television series.
In ""Sequel,"" a man claiming to be Roy Martin (Carol's first husband) enters the Brady's lives. It's a bizarre situation (unthinkable as a plot in the original series!), and Carol and the bunch must figure out how to deal with this challenge to their established family. Clever twists on plot points from the original series are interwoven as subplots in the film; Jan's imaginary boyfriend, for example, is a key running gag (which has a marvelous resolution, and well showcases Jennifer Elise Cox's comic appeal). Another key subplot involves an unexpected attraction between step-siblings Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes) and Marcia (Christine Taylor); the filmmakers, I believe, keep this potentially kinky theme within the bounds of good taste.
""Sequel"" continues the first film's running gag that the Bradys are stuck in a sort of 70s time warp, and are oblivious to 90s culture. Some of this ""fish-out-of-water"" humor is weak; the movie Bradys are at their best and funniest, I believe, when they are wholly in their own groovy element. The cast members seem really comfortable in their roles, and have a great chemistry together. As an ensemble they hit just the right balance between campiness and genuine familial affection.
Overall, ""Sequel"" gave me lots of smiles and chuckles, and the 70s-style costumes provided constant visual appeal. If you're a long-time Brady fan (like me!), don't miss it.",1030320000,,1683,5.168498168498169
835628,4,6304279000,"I must say when I first heard about the Brady Bunch having a movie, I thought.....why ?  But after seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised at how they poked fun at the innocence of the family.  I found it clever how they put them in the 90's with the same woredrobes and attitudes they had in the tv show. The original throws in unexpected gags and inside jokes that, for instance, the next door neighbor is attracted to all the Brady boys and would obvious take advantage of one if she could, Marsha is full of herself and the guys don't only want her but some girls do too, lol. Oh plus Jan is just a Psycho, lol.
  With all that said, now to the squel, it takes all those little things and improves on them.  For instance there's a sick relationship between Marsha and Greg involving where they start finding themselves attracted to each other. Which in itself offers some pretty funny scenes. Tim Matheson (Animal House, 1941) is a good improvement to the sequel as Mr.s Bradie's so called missing husband. The best scene with him is when Alice mistakes his bag of swooms for just playing mushrooms and puts them in his spegetti.  That's a funny scene but it probably would of been funnier if the Bradies ate some too, lol.
  Well in all the Brady Bunch movies aren't exactly like the tv show .....obviously, which makes them more enjoyable, especially this sequel. Now if only they would get released on dvd.",1020297600,,1411,4.5058823529411764

The end climax of this storyline take place in Hawaii. Other plots involve the mutual attraction between Greg and Marcia. It's played for laughs and it really gets them!. Again, the actors are all incredible. They bring these characters alive with incredibly accurate impressions of the original actors. Especially Gary Cole as Mr. Brady. Just like the original, there are jokes that deal with happenings in classic Brady episodes. Some of them might not make sense to those who aren't a Brady Bunch dictionary.

7867124,3,6304279000,"I don't blame them for trying to make a sequel quickly before those kids got too old, but this movie feels like it was thrown together quickly and pales in comparison to the original in every way.

They stay in their house at the beginning of the movie for way too long (25 minutes) and are introduced to a new character that points out how odd they are instead of interacting with the modern world. No offense to Tim Matheson, but I think they could've cast someone better as he overplays his character making himself odd too.

The trip out scene would've been better had they done more with it. I know this was probably a hard sell to creator Sherwood Schwartz as he was responsible for them removing a lot of ""inappropriate"" content from the original film. So, that may be why it's so dull and a missed opportunity.

Greg and Marcia moving in together is the highlight of the movie and pretty much the only reason to watch. Shadow puppets!

The movie was advertised on the Brady's going to Hawaii (i mean, look at the poster), but it doesn't happen until the very end of the film and while the change of venue is nice, it feels out of place and abrupt. And don't get me started on that terrible joke about the plane video being reversed. Perhaps they should've instead immediately started work on a third film with the Hawaii theme and changed the ending to this one.
