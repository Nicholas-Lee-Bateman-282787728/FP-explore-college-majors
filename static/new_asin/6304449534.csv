  The movie was a vanity project for George Saunders who wrote the screenplay, directed and produced the film, and cast himself as the main character. George portrays a painter of nudes and he is under pressure to complete some projects for his next showing. Meanwhile, his wife, played by the gorgeous Nicole Gain, is set to inherit millions if her ailing mother dies, but her stepfather wants all the money for himself. How do you spell murder? In order to meet his deadline, George hires the recently arrived Lisa Boyle who rents a room from George and Nicole. Lisa performs double duty here (no pun intended). She poses for, and then seduces the husband. Meanwhile a new guy moves in next door, borrows a cup of sugar from Nicole (no kidding) and says, more or less, he wouldnt need any sugar for his coffee if he had Nicole. In order to seduce his neighbor he quotes long passages from Keats which causes Nicole to jump naked into the backyard pool.
  What the movie has: Two gorgeous women displaying their wares throughout the movie. Amateurish acting from the male leads. Many instances where audio is poorly recorded. For example, when the couple is at the beach, it is hard to decipher what is being  said as the sounds of the ocean overwhelm the conversation. A convoluted plot that has one too many twists leading up to an illogical conclusion. But if you want to see a soft core flick with beautiful females getting naked and partaking in R-rated sexual situations, this movie fits the bill nicely. Now if they would only remake it but have Jag Mundrah direct, ditching George Saunders for Andrew Stevens while throwing out the last twist (totally unnecessary), and youd have a top notch flick.",1386547200,,1760,4.750819672131148
7871957,4,6304449534,"Intimate Deception doesn't seem to have a lot to offer (besides an often naked Lisa Boyle) with its familiar plot, but it really pulls the rabbit out of the hat with a couple of impressive plot twists at the end, earning a good deal of my respect in the process.  The basic story is, as I said, rather familiar.  Charlie (George Saunder) is a newlywed painter who has been struggling mentally to deal with the fact that he fought with and shot an intruder several months earlier.  He does still have a wife who loves him, albeit theirs is an awkward sort of marriage, and he also has a rich mother-in-law sponsoring a big art exhibit for him.  His wife's step-father hates Charlie as much as Charlie hates him, but all in all things could be worse (and eventually are).  Things take a dramatic turn in the life of Charlie and his wife Jennifer (Nicole Gian) when Tina (played by the gorgeous Lisa Boyle) rents a room in the house and a smarmy new male neighbor moves in beside them.  John's (Dan Frank) sugar-borrowing, poetry-quoting ways soon have Jennifer in his clutches, and for her part Tina is having no trouble keeping Charlie distracted.
If this were a simple case of adultery, though, the film wouldn't be called Intimate Deception.  Hatred, jealousy, and greed make major cameo appearances here, and Charlie's struggles with his memory of the night of the intruder, while annoying at first, come to serve as the secret ingredient in the film's surprisingly good conclusion.  One weakness of Intimate Deception is the acting.  George Saunder (who also wrote, produced, and directed the film) struggles at times to be convincing, especially when emotions are called for, and this does weaken the film a bit.  Nicole Gian is quite good most of the time, as is Lisa Boyle, but intense emotions don't come out of them with complete conviction.
Let's not kid ourselves here.  The prospect of Lisa Boyle naked (and Nicole Gian is no slouch herself) is the main draw for this film, and most people will approach Intimate Deception as an erotic film.  It is rather erotic, with several nude scenes, but things really never progress beyond an R-rated level - there is just more of it than there would be in an R-rated film.  In the end, though, it is really quite an impressive drama and thriller, and I think many of those who watch this film will find it to be a pleasant surprise when all is said and done.",1060041600,3,2410,4.642352941176471
