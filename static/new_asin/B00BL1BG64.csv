8570108,4,B00BL1BG64,"My wife and I have enjoyed Falling Skies over the last month as we caught up with all of the episodes.  It has been getting better with each season.  The storyline, character development, and acting started a bit rocky, but improved quite a bit with each episode.",1424044800,,263,4.574468085106383
8570109,3,B00BL1BG64,"A decent SF series with great aliens and very good FX.
The storyline is very predictable and I guess you would say standard.  The acting is ok but very formulaic.

The only serious problem w/ the series is that credibility is lacking when you think about the shortcomings of the alien invaders who have decimated 90% of the human population yet lack basic night vision/thermal sensing technology and things such as this.

Although I get the impression they would like to have a product comparable to the Battlestar Galactica rebook, the writers are clearly producing product geared for the adolescent mindset.  That said, it's still entertaining.",1424044800,,646,5.066037735849057
8570110,3,B00BL1BG64,to much like walking dead with aliens; not enough aliens too much soap opera,1423612800,,76,4.5
