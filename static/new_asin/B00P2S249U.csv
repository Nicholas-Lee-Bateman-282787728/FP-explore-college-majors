8686258,5,B00P2S249U,I love this Forbidden Hollywood series. This volume is great. The pre-code movies have a very modern mentality and it's very interesting the difference between these and code movies. Much freer and a lot more fun in some ways. Highly Recommend this collection. A little pricey but worth it.,1530921600,,290,4.938775510204081
8686259,5,B00P2S249U,Blond Crazy is the up there with the best of pre-code. I never get tired of watching it. Joan Blondell fan here. And Cagney.,1506556800,,124,4.208333333333333
8686260,2,B00P2S249U,There are some really good movies here.  Too bad it's a DVD-R and not a pressed DVD.  It means the disc costs more than it needs to and may have quality issues.,1486684800,3,160,3.96875

8686262,5,B00P2S249U,"What can I say, I bought this for the James Cagney film ""Blonde Crazy"". It's a great set and definitely a necessity for any classic film lover. I've only played 2 discs and they work great.",1481414400,,189,4.277777777777778
8686263,4,B00P2S249U,"I think like most people I bought this set for the Cagney picture ""Blonde Crazy.""  I wasn't let down at all with that movie.  Was an early side of Cagney in a playful role with Joan Blondell as his perfect sidekick.  It's just not available any other way than in this set.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is because the rest of the movies included were junk.  That's a cute little advertising package they came up with to put the best on the cover and the rest is crap.  They are okay is you wanna have a nostalgia night but just get ready for Norma Shearer's complete overacting.",1454889600,5,579,4.171171171171171
8686264,5,B00P2S249U,"Once you start collecting pre-code movies, you just can't stop!  I'm pretty sure my love for them is pathological, but as addictions go, it's pretty harmless.  This isn't my favorite collection, but if you're a fan of this era, you can't go wrong with this collection.",1450310400,4,268,4.804347826086956
8686265,5,B00P2S249U,"I ordered directly from Warner Bros., the discs were pressed, not burned.

These are all Great Movies!  My favorite is, ""Blonde Crazy"".

One of the things you'll notice about movies made in this time period, is they are not subject to political correctness, or various ""speech codes"".  An interesting reflection on the freedoms people once had, in the past.",1447113600,3,357,5.0
8686266,4,B00P2S249U,"I love pre-code movies and Forbidden Hollywood Vol. 8 makes it 8 for 8 for me. This is not the greatest set in the collection, but frankly I really don't care much. I enjoy these films that at times pushed the limits of early '30's decorum and were often the starting point for long and memorable careers even after these movies were long forgotten. That said the strongest and probably best entry is Blonde Crazy starring Jimmy Cagney and Joan Blondell as hotel workers out conning the con artists and having a lot of 'fun'with one another. Peppered with a lot of snappy patter and plenty of double entendres, this film picks up the vibe that audiences have come to expect from a Cagney/Blondell pairing.
Hi, Nellie seems like quite a departure for future Academy Award winner Paul Muni. Before anyone gets irate about Emile Zola playing a demoted newspaper reporter who gets demoted to writing the advice column and drowning in his cup, keep in mind that this was early in his career and as was typical of most contract players they never knew what they were going to be assigned next. This is somewhat fun to watch if only because it is a huge departure from what Muni was typically assigned, but the script is strange and inconsistent at times.
The third move that surfaces is an MGM offering Strangers May Kiss starring the Queen Of The Lot Norma Shearer and her sometime co-star Robert Montgomery. Let's describe this as society girl goes looking for love in all the wrong places. After a string of hits featuring Shearer as a ""modern"" woman my worst criticism is this one is weak. Heck, I am a big Shearer fan so I am happy to add this to my overall collection.
Any movie with Edward G. Robinson is a treat for me. Dark Hazzard is an obscure movie but also an interesting one. Robinson is a gambler torn between a virtuous woman (Genevieve Tobin) and a not so virtuous but interesting one (Glenda Farrell). Glenda has the same sassy cuteness as previously mentioned Joan Blondell. I suspect that they were used interchangeably at Warner Brothers because the were so alike physically and comedically. The story also has a dog! But this is not Lassie by a long shot. I enjoyed this for no better reason than it was a new movie for me and I love the Robinson and Farrell pairing.
The whole of this collection is better than the parts. Blonde Crazy is the best and the rest are interesting, but more nominally so. I'm giving this 4*. I love the series, but I also wish this had Mary Stevens. M.D. or/and Dr. Monica included.
I can promise you that mixed messages and raciness imbedded in these movies Wil,keep you thinking, focused and often laughing and shaking your head. Before the code, movies were substantially more interesting.",1423440000,27,2737,4.62217659137577
8686267,4,B00P2S249U,"Love Blonde Crazy 1931 with Joan Blondell and Cagney.  The early 1930's orchestras are my favorites, love those sounds.  It starts off with a beautiful rendition of the 1931 hit ""When Your Lover Has Gone"" and it is played as background music also throughout the movie.  It's a really good movie, moves fast as many of the pre-code films of  the early 1930s do.  Interesting to see the way we dressed, the great cars we drove, the music we danced to, the prices we paid for items, appliances we used, etc.  Joan Blondell is adorable as always.  IMO, the other films were just so so.
I bought this because I wanted to own Blonde Crazy for all the reasons mentioned above.",1423008000,11,669,4.479338842975206
