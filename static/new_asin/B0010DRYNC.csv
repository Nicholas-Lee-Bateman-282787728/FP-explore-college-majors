3048716,3,B0010DRYNC,"The film does not ostracize and stigmatize meth addicts. Instead it displays meth as the menace next door, infiltrating and destroying small-town rural America. An epidemic reaching your neighbor, brother, uncle, or cousin. American Meth also examines the many sides and people involved in the struggle against the drug: the justice system, the addicts (""tweakers""), families, human service workers, politicians, etc.

I wish they would have spent more time on the history of Meth, improved the sound and music quality of the film, and omitted many of the redundant interviews. Overall, I appreciate Hunt's observation of our country's Meth dilemma, especially since it is a drug that has had a pernicious impact on many of our communities in Washington state.",1243728000,6,760,5.333333333333333
3048717,4,B0010DRYNC,"""American Meth"" Might just open some eyes that were totally oblivious to the problem this country has, regarding this VERY dangerous ""drug"", and it's effects, not just to the user, but on society, as well. There are interviews of ""former"" Meth users, in states that one would not associate with this sort of thing. From Montana and Wyoming, to Utah. The cities these people live in, are more aptly referred to as ""Towns""! Not the first place one would look, to see the epidemic.

We are introduced to some ""former"" users, and their viewpoint on their progress to kick the drug. A question is asked of them, about the current Anti-Meth Campaigns being put forth by the respective states, if they are effective. The answer is NO.

Then we see interviews of Law Enforcement Officials, Social Workers and City Leaders, with their views on how to eradicate Meth from Society. There is one Deputy, in Multnomah County, Oregon, who has erected a site online, that one can see the physical effects of Meth. This drug has everything one could look for, if they want to look 40 years older than they actually are!! It's a sobering view of the damage this drug causes. The Website is: facesofmeth.us

Then we are privy, somewhat, to the private lives of James and Holly, Husband and Wife Meth users, with four youngsters, living on the fringes, because of their habit, and the bad decisions made, because of it. As another reviewer states, this segment begins to look like a ""Reality Show"", because the segment is so heavily edited. We do, however, get to see Holly going door to door, bumming money, to buy the drug, then the immediate effects of the drug, in front of her family! These two WANT to get off Meth, but do not possess the personal fortitude to do so, so they make the decision to move back to Illinois, where they came from.

There is a ray of hope, at the conclusion of the film, as we are given updates on all the people that were interviewed. They so far, have remained clean. James and Holly, likewise, reached Illinois, and among family and friends, have been clean, and are resuming the lives that Meth put on hold, for so long.

The film challenges Leaders, of Town, City and State, to find ways of educating the young, on the destructive nature of this drug, which is 40 times stronger than Heroin, and has a microscopic recovery rate, when compared to Heroin recovery, BEFORE they take the drug, as was seen in those interviews. ONE HIT is enough to keep one addicted! It also challenges parents, to be involved in their children's lives, and provide a foil, against drug use.

A very informative documentary on the epidemic of the modern age.",1209600000,6,2656,4.640425531914894
3048718,3,B0010DRYNC,"A first-time film-maker gets the benefit of the doubt for what is ultimately a very well intentioned and necessary documentary narrated by Val Kilmer.  ""American Meth"" moves along smoothly in the beginning and takes in a fair cross-section of America, interviewing both addicts, law enforcement, and others who clean up or otherwise try to alleviate the mess.  Justin Hunt's documentary explains the history of its subject drug, names those who invented and refined it, and provides snippets like the fact that Hitler was a regular user.  There is also an outstanding rundown of meth ingredients that many people will have never heard of, including lithium batteries and lightbulbs!  Unfortunately the narrative hits a wall in the form of James and Holly, two excuse-making addicts, and the show devolves into reality tv that strongly resembles ""Big Brother"" shot in a double-wide.  Unfortunately there are four children involved, with all of the males sporting outrageous mullets, and much yelling and waving of arms is awkwardly subtitled as a way of explaining each argument and counteraccusation.  This was the STOP button for me.  Threaded throughout the documentary and available separately is an excellent soundtrack, a redeeming feature that you can take with you.

Of course, this is through no fault of the production team, who has crafted a fine, if somewhat time-sensitive, piece.

3048726,3,B0010DRYNC,"Like most reviewers, I would point out that the film seems to be separated into two parts. The first is much more from a perspective of law-enforcement, ad agencies trying to get kids not to try meth the first time, and a sickening view of the ingredients of meth; including kitty litter, lighter fluid, batteries and drano. This just proved to me that as drugs have become harder to get (particularly marijuana) people will try anything to escape their reality.

The second part of the film seemed like happenstance for the filmmakers. They ran into a young couple with four children who were willing to open their homes to the cameras. Obviously, it was hard for the filmmakers to turn down such an invitation right into the lives of meth addicts with children, but it was never really edited later to try to make the transition a little more seamless.

Nevertheless, the time with the family stood in stark contrast to the numbers and law enforcement officials and the ad campaign people and govt. officials. Here were the real people choosing to do this drug. There is a sense of hopelessness hanging over the house, and the wife seems suicidal. I don't think she cares much about going onto or off meth, she just wants to die. Since she can't overtly kill herself because of the children, it does seem possible she is trying through other means. Particularly not doing one thing to take care of her cancer. There is a deep depression at work here, and I'm surprised the husband is strong enough and thinking clearly enough to deal with some of this effectively. But the job is far to much for him. Just keeping up with the day to day would be too much These people need help and guidance.

Another thing that was striking were the comments that called this family 'white trash trailer park mullet people'. and that it had gone downhill with the 'white trash'. In fact, these people and those comments are a big part of the problem. The wife says she doesn't matter to anyone. That nobody cares for her so what is the point? That people judge her and she feels very little love from the world. This is a woman who was prostituted by her own mother from the ages of 5-7 so her mother could get drugs. How does a person get over such trauma????? She grows up in poverty and the message every day is ""You are worthless. You are trailer trash. The story went downhill when we had to waste time with the losers who didn't deserve their kids"". She isn't humanized by her family. Not by her society. Not on the internet segment despite a childhood spent being prostituted to pedophiles by her own mother when she should have been in kindergarten.

I wish this country would stop seeing people's value in terms of their money. If they had been sitting in a mansion under similar circumstances, we wouldn't have gotten the 'trailer park trash' comments. Yes, the kids should be in school but the mother is suicidally depressed and traumatized and dad is barely holding onto a thread to hold all this together.

I wish we could have more compassion when confronted with these types of situations. Many times, the people have been abused and hurt at important developmental stages. If we could just see why these children should have food and have some hope and love, without harsh judgment. The parents know what they are doing wrong. They are all too aware. It probably makes them less likely to tell the truth or even seek help.

The family at the end humanized this tragic drug for me. And made me feel tremendous compassion for the people who get caught in this cycle. It must be horrible to wake up everyday and not have a reason to open your eyes. As jobs and opportunities dry up for those without college degrees, and we are becoming a more stratified, even bordering on aristocratic society instead of democratic, people will feel that being poor is a moral judgement and fault. Adding drugs to that just confirms what the world thinks of you anyway and eases some of the nightmares that you really don't matter to anyone.

I belong to a religious movement (and I'm completely in support of you if you do not: good people come from all points of views and beliefs) that believes we are all 'children of God'. Put another way, we are not throw-aways and worthless and useless. We make mistakes. These people's biggest mistake was being born into a cruel family and severely sexually abused and having lingering feelings of suicide and a desire to make the bad thoughts go away. I'm done plenty of things wrong. I've made terrible choices, so I'm not going to scorn someone trying to pick themselves up from what she's been through. I just sincerely hope that people will see this family with less judgement and much more compassion, and that they are getting real help where they are.

Meth seems like a scary drug. .A last resort for those who care little about whether they wake up tomorrow. That in itself is an entirely different, and much more tragic, problem than someone wanting to get a little high.",1369353600,6,5009,4.6076233183856505

3048729,2,B0010DRYNC,"A hard-hitting documentarist he is not. The film was mediocre in the first half... some interviews with people either taking or fighting meth, all of whom are way too aware of the camera and all say the exact kind of thing they expect they should be saying (""30 seconds. 30 seconds"" or ""I'm gonna stop and really focus on my family"" yada yada). The latter half of the film focuses waaaaaaay too long on the despicable trailer family, and we see less evidence that meth is the cause of their problems than simply being horrible, filthy people.

The story went downhill when we had to waste time with the losers who didn't deserve their kids"". She isn't humanized by her family. Not by her society. Not on the internet segment despite a childhood spent being prostituted to pedophiles by her own mother when she should have been in kindergarten.

I wish this country would stop seeing people's value in terms of their money. If they had been sitting in a mansion under similar circumstances, we wouldn't have gotten the 'trailer park trash' comments. Yes, the kids should be in school but the mother is suicidally depressed and traumatized and dad is barely holding onto a thread to hold all this together.

I wish we could have more compassion when confronted with these types of situations. Many times, the people have been abused and hurt at important developmental stages. If we could just see why these children should have food and have some hope and love, without harsh judgment. The parents know what they are doing wrong. They are all too aware. It probably makes them less likely to tell the truth or even seek help.

The family at the end humanized this tragic drug for me. And made me feel tremendous compassion for the people who get caught in this cycle. It must be horrible to wake up everyday and not have a reason to open your eyes. As jobs and opportunities dry up for those without college degrees, and we are becoming a more stratified, even bordering on aristocratic society instead of democratic, people will feel that being poor is a moral judgement and fault. Adding drugs to that just confirms what the world thinks of you anyway and eases some of the nightmares that you really don't matter to anyone.

I belong to a religious movement (and I'm completely in support of you if you do not: good people come from all points of views and beliefs) that believes we are all 'children of God'. Put another way, we are not throw-aways and worthless and useless. We make mistakes. These people's biggest mistake was being born into a cruel family and severely sexually abused and having lingering feelings of suicide and a desire to make the bad thoughts go away. I'm done plenty of things wrong. I've made terrible choices, so I'm not going to scorn someone trying to pick themselves up from what she's been through. I just sincerely hope that people will see this family with less judgement and much more compassion, and that they are getting real help where they are.

Meth seems like a scary drug. .A last resort for those who care little about whether they wake up tomorrow. That in itself is an entirely different, and much more tragic, problem than someone wanting to get a little high.",1369353600,6,5009,4.6076233183856505

3283226,2,B0010DRYNC,"A hard-hitting documentarist he is not. The film was mediocre in the first half... some interviews with people either taking or fighting meth, all of whom are way too aware of the camera and all say the exact kind of thing they expect they should be saying (""30 seconds. 30 seconds"" or ""I'm gonna stop and really focus on my family"" yada yada). The latter half of the film focuses waaaaaaay too long on the despicable trailer family, and we see less evidence that meth is the cause of their problems than simply being horrible, filthy people.

8237729,3,B0010DRYNC,"American Meth is insightful and I did learn some new things about the epidemic but I feel like the film could have been a little broader.  Like a lot of other reviewers have already mentioned it is a big subject and is hard to zero in on just one segment.  The movie touches on several different areas Law enforcement, advertising prevention, the addicts themselves and a bit of reality TV following a single family hooked on the drug.  I have lived and visited several of the towns in the film which is sad and disturbing.  In no way does it represent the whole communities at large.  But it is sad to see so many lives destroyed by people hopelessly addicted with their need to be high.  I do not envy the drug enforcement officers who have to deal with these people day in and day out.  Those guys don't get paid enough.

When the foreman who shows everything that goes into making the drug pulls out all the ingredients I was pretty shocked.  How could anyone put that crap into their body.  I found it tragic that the drug was originally intended to help people and over time was played with morphed and mutated into a cheap highly addictive toxic substance that the user craves with devastating effects.  The drug does seem to follow our nations interstate system up and down the major freeways.  With the big oil boom going on in North Dakota, eastern Montana and up into Canada I am sure it is hard to keep their workers clean.  A lot of the young people's excuses seem to be that they are bored nothing is around there, nothing to do.

When the movie discusses how bad the meth problem hit rural communities and gives an example of an Indian reservation where usage went up 300% in just a year.  Those poor people were dealing with enough already just trying to survive living right at the poverty line and then some Mexican cartel comes in and gets the whole community hooked.  At the end of the film it mentions that the epidemic is already spreading eastward where the majority of the population of the US lives.  The film mostly focuses on Oregon, Montana, Wyoming and New Mexico mostly rural states but the problem is everywhere.

When you see the recovering addicts you can tell by their faces that they are scared and unsure if they can make it clean.  Most seem lucky to be alive and look like shell's of their former selves.

The trailer park family is another tragedy.  It makes you wonder if they have tried reaching out for help enough. The husband says he did have a Christian background was there no way for them to get some kind of assistance or have they burned every bridge behind them?  You don't see off camera the choices they made to end up at that point that got them to where they were.  Not a lot of personal responsibility on their part as adults or parents.  The boyfriend admits that they should not have had all the kids.  The mother is combative to her neighbors instead of being honest or trying to resolve conflicts she just escalates them.  At the end of the film you can tell that the move did the family good almost right off the bat.

It will be interesting to find out with the legalization of Marijuana in several states will the numbers of meth addicts go up or stay the same.

The film is kind of a Debbie downer, even though most of the stories seem to have people getting back on the right track.  Perhaps they should do a sequel in 10 years and see where the users lives are and if the drug numbers have gone up or down.  This film is definitely not for everyone I would rate it at 3 stars powerful and sad at the same time.",1437523200,,3575,4.380880121396054
