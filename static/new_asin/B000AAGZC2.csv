8077091,5,B000AAGZC2,"Racist, sexist, politically incorrect and hillarious. You almost feel bad about laughing at some of the jokes but they have to be seen to believe. Segura plays the anti-hero in a better role that has been before or since. He even forces his ailing father to beg in the streets and steals the offerings at the end of the day. Their apartment is also the only one I have seen in a movie that you can almost smell it is so dirty. No Hoolywood throw around a few clothes but convincingly done. Segura is the guy you love to hate and if your humor is dark enough you will be laughing all the way through.

First in a triology this is by far the best and certainly worth a multiple viewings.",1281312000,2,685,4.229007633587786
8077092,5,B000AAGZC2,"You may have probably heard about Santiago Segura from his roles in The Girl of Your Dreams; Dying of Laughter; or Masterpiece; but his creation of Torrente has to be by far his best. I was introduced to Torrente when I visited a cousin in Madrid. He was a film student in Finland and I asked for him to put the funniest movie I could watch. Without hesitation he reached for Torrente. We were laughing so hard we woke up my anut and uncle. He was laughing just as hard as me, and he had probably seen it more than ten times. This is the kind of movie it is. You can't believe the guy is saying or doing the things shown on screen. This is by far the funniest movie of all time!!!",1128384000,3,680,4.082089552238806
8077093,5,B000AAGZC2,"This is the first entry in the series. Torrente 2 is already there and Torrente 3 will come out this Fall 2005 worldwide.

What can I say it hasn't been said already? Torrente 1 was the biggest money making picture in its day in Spain. So it was Torrente 2... and Torrente 3 will also probably do it again. Its dialogues have become vox populi... The author, Santiago Segura, an icon... Why? Check this movie out. It goes where no movie has gone before. And if your player can not read Zone 2, use your computer or buy a new DVD player. It's worth it.",1122940800,,551,4.247619047619048
