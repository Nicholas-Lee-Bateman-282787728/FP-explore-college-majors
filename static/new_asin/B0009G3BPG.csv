2289245,5,B0009G3BPG,"Its been about twenty years since DAGORAH- THE SPACE MONSTER played on US television, and its a welcome return for this very original and clever thriller. This Giant monster epic was created in Japan by Toho pictures, the creators of Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra. The film was
distributed to US TV by American International in the 1970s where the name was changed from DOGORA to DAGORA so viewers wouldnt think it would be about a giant dog. Actually its about a giant , levitating , ever growing and multiplying space entity. It looks like a translucent jellyfish and feeds on earths carbons. Aside from the monster plot, there is a sub-plot dealing with Interpol agents  hunting diamond smugglers (remember the whole carbon connection). It all intermingles very well
and plays like a plot out of Ultraman, but with no Ultraman.  First, there is the mystery. Then the investigation. A monster is discovered. the Military attacks. Scientists speculate. A super weapon is devised. The monster is
attttacked again. The good guys catch the criminals.  You get the picture.
This one has really clever monster effects utilising puppets, water and animation making this one very different from the other Toho monster movies. But still alot of fun. Dogora (or Dagora) never returned in another  monster movie.

Special thanks to Tokyo Shock for releasing this line of legendary and lost japanese monster films in america.  I hear Yog may be next in line.
If you like Dogora, please perchase Varan- The Unbelievable, The Mysterians and Matango- Attack of the Mushroom People.

In recent years it has been almost impossible to get your hands on any Toho monster movie that doesnt have Godzilla as the star. This is probably due to having younger executives at the distributors who don't even know that these other fims, and characters, even exist.  There are alot of great Toho films, many with giant monsters, still not available in the US. And unseen since the early 1980s.
Amoung them are:
BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE a sequel to The Mysterians with very cool pre Star Wars/ Aliens space drop and combat sequences.
GORATH about an asteroid with a huge gravity well about to colide with Earth and featuring a giant walrus.
DAIGORA VS. GOLIATH about a friendly creature avenging the death of his mother against a horned evil monster, Has never been seen in america.
THE HUMAN VAPOR about a master criminal who can become a literal gas.
SECRET OF THE TELEGIAN about teleportation is a color film that was only distributed in B&W in the US.
ESPY is about spys with ESP.
THE INVISIBLE MAN is a modern scifi take on the old concept.
HALF HUMAN is about a Yeti protecting its young.
THE H-MAN is about hydrogen based creatures invading Tokyo through the sewers.
MOTHRA, yes Mothra, the original is still not available on DVD.
REBIRTH OF MOTHRA 3 featuring Mothra time traveling to battle King Ghidorah has never been released on DVD in america.

MOTHRA, BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE, H-MAN, AND REBIRTH OF MOTHRA 3 are owned by Sony/tristar/Columbia in the US.
Several of the other titles I mentioned were known to have been distributed by United Productions of America. Wonder who owns them now?

Some other Toho monsters that never returned:
1) FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER, giant version from Frankenstein Conquers the World
2) MEGALON  cyborg beetle from Godzilla vs. Megalon
3) GEZORA and GANIMES giant Cuttlefish and crab from YOG- MONSTER FROM SPACE.

2289250,4,B0009G3BPG,"What a delight to have some of the major Toho sci-fi spectacles of the 50s and 60s on quality DVD and in such beautiful shape.  'Dogora' was made toward the end of the cycle, when Godzilla flicks were occupying most of the studios time and money, and it's a little bit on the 'talky' side, veering away from special effects.  Still fascinating to watch, however.  Original storyboards show a much more spectacular production, on a scale equivalent to 'Mysterians' and 'Battle in Outer Space.'  The usual fun script  by Shinichi Sekizawa, and energetically-directed by Ishiro Honda.  It's lamentable 'Tokyo Shock' was not able to give us a super-DVD edition of 'Gorath,' one of the most ambitious and expensive of the 'space operas' that the Toho team created.",1376006400,,759,4.937007874015748

2289252,3,B0009G3BPG,"I saw the English version on TV a few times as a kid...it left very little impression. It was extraordinary only in its mediocrity (and the hotter than hot Akiko Wakabayashi).

But seeing it in Japanese, I was surprised to find it was a pretty enjoyable action comedy that actually made me laugh out loud a few times. Unlike the dub, the original version is openly tongue-in-cheek. Robert Dunham's proto-otaku character is the big highlight (""Oh, edamame! Such a delicate flavor!"") in this odd hybrid of gangster spoof/old-school monster movie. If it remained as consistently engaging throughout as its first half, it would scrape classic-hood. The efforts to take down the titular monster take center stage in the later parts, and that takes attention away from the entertaining characters. As it is, it's definitely a worthy addition to your collection of creature features, and it has a killer score by Ifukube.

After seeing this, you'll likely want to become a Diamond G-Man, whatever that is. It looks like a fun job.",1333152000,4,1023,4.976608187134503
2289253,3,B0009G3BPG,"Tokyo Shock takes off their training wheels for this one, as at the time of release they had no region 2 release of the movie to fall back on. To sum up their efforts: mixed at best, with a decent video and audio presentation that is supplemented with hardly any new extras for those who have picked up the previous titles from the firm. The company's first foray into making a video track from scratch for a Toho film is met with mixed results. The first thing to note are the colors, which look very vibrant on this release. Sadly, this effect was achieved through over saturating the source, resulting in an unnatural looking color spectrum at times. The brightness level, to compensate for the darker hues, was also beefed up. This, sadly, has a fairly negative effect on things like lab coats and other details, which now look washed out. As for the shape of the print used, it tends to be in good condition for most of the duration. In general, there are some minor scratches, while there is a minor amount of grain present as well. Sadly, the shape of the print isn't consistent. For example, there is some noticeable print damage that occurs during the opening credit sequence, as seen here with the vertical yellow line. As expected, any scenes with stock footage or super imposition sport a much more apparent amount of print damage as well, with a prime example seen here. In spite of its faults, the print is still in very good shape considering the film's age. Regretfully, the movie has also been cropped on all four sides, an aspect which is obvious when comparing this release to Toho's region 2 Dogora DVD.Dogora is presented on the disc in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, or Toho Scope, and is Anamorphic for widescreen TVs. The company's standard array of options for the audio presentation are gone for this release, but the basics are here, and presented well enough that it's hard to be cross about it. In total, there are two audio tracks present. The first is a 2.0 mono track in English of the, horrendous, international dubbing for the film. For the record, this is the same dubbing used on AIP's TV release in the US, so those that have nostalgic attachment to it would likely be pleased to see its inclusion here. As for the quality of the audio track, it's certainly not perfect. The entire audio track, in fact, sounds like the upper volume levels have been reduced, making everything sound flat, even for a mono track. Quality is also iffy, with the dialogue sometimes sounding rough as the source was clearly not in the best of condition. The audio track wavers in and out too, although very rarely, with the clearest example happening when the bridge collapses. The other audio track present is a 2.0 mono presentation of the film's original Japanese audio track. Thankfully, this audio track is just about flawless. The volume levels are all maintained well here, while there are no pops or crackles to be heard. As expected with the mono format, there is no speaker distinction, and while a stereo or surround option would have been a nice addition, the mono track still gets the job done. The Japanese track is accompanied by, removable, English subtitles. The subtitle job on this disc is fairly faithful, a few typos aside, while a second set of subtitles can be turned on for the English dubbed track, which will translate Japanese text seen in the film. Tokyo Shock takes their swing at trying to stock this disc with extras from their own resources, and comes up noticeably short. It wouldn't be fair to call it a bare bones release, but it's pretty close. The first extra on this disc is a large array of production stills related to the film, all in black and white. Unfortunately, the quality of the photos leaves some to be desired, with the brightness level often set high enough that it washes out most of the detail while circular edges in the pictures look very rough, like a ""gif"" image that has been enlarged. The other extra here is the film's original trailer and some select previews. Dogora's trailer is in good condition, with very little print damage present and with no digital inconsistencies to speak of. It has the same color problems of the film found on the DVD, though, and is also likewise cropped. The other original trailer present is for Matango, which, thankfully, has been spared any tampering. The Varan trailer though isn't as fortunate, as it now sports an overlapped English title and is no longer anamorphic. It's not enough to get upset over, certainly less than was done for Tokyo Shock's cheesy The Mysterians trailer, which is also present. The last trailer here, and the only one which isn't Toho, is the US trailer for Gappa. Bottom line, the disc is lacking a bit, especially compared to other efforts from the company released around the same time. That said, still far from a bad release for those just looking to enjoy the movie without much concern for the extras.",1325548800,,4955,4.68348623853211

2289255,4,B0009G3BPG,"With their first-class DVD releases of Varan, The Unbelievable; Matango; and The Mysterians, Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock showed folks on the wrong side of the water just how it ought to be done. Essentially repackaged versions of the Toho Region 2 DVDs, the aforementioned releases have included all the original extra features as well as a choice of English subtitles or dubbing (except for Varan, which offers subtitles only). The newest Tokyo Shock release, Dogora (a.k.a. Space Monster Dogora, a.k.a. Dagora, The Space Monster) comes to us without the benefit of a Region 2 release to work from, and the difference between this package and the others is quickly evident. It features no commentary tracks, featurettes, or other noteworthy extras typical of Toho's domestic DVD releases. Though it does provide a still gallery and original theatrical trailer (sans subtitles, alas), compared to the previous products, Dogora seems somewhat bare bones.

Know what? I don't care very much. I've yet to peruse all the extras on the other DVDs anyway (though I eventually will, to be sure). I pick up these DVDs for the movies themselves, and while I love having the extra goodies, by no stretch do they make or break the package's value for me. In the case of Dogora, the near-pristine print, wide-screen presentation, and choice of subtitles or dubbing makes this release another clear winner. A few reddish marks appear on the print during the opening titles of the film, but otherwise, the visual presentation appears flawless. As is generally the case, the Japanese audio track is much higher quality than the English one, with deep, full-bodied sound even in mono; the English audio track is recorded at a much lower volume and sounds very tinny. On the positive side, the dubbed soundtrack is the same one used in the original 1964 American International release and is of reasonably high quality--unlike the redone English audio production on Tokyo Shock's DVD of The Mysterians, which is downright horrible.

In a nutshell, Dogora is about an odd life form that has developed in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and has a singular taste for materials composed of carbon. At the beginning of the film, an unknown force destroys a new satellite as it orbits the earth; soon afterward, significant quantities of diamonds begin disappearing all over the world. Naturally enough, investigators believe that human culprits are responsible, but as more and more people witness large amounts of carbon-based material, such as coal, being suddenly sucked into the atmosphere, it becomes clear that something else is doing the pilfering. (Not that this revelation sways our intrepid authorities from stubbornly staying on the trail of a notorious gang of diamond thieves.) As the space creature devours more carbon, it continually mutates--or evolves--until it becomes a gigantic, airborne, jellyfish-like creature with an insatiable appetite.

Dogora is one of Toho's most unusual daikaiju films for numerous reasons, perhaps most notably for the fact that the monster is something of a minor character. Though the ""outer space cell"" may be the catalyst for the story, most of the movie's running time is devoted to the antics of our fairly amusing diamond thieves and the efforts of the detectives who want to stop them. As a youngster watching this movie on TV for the first time, sometime in the late 60s, I found it all rather dull and boring and without imagination; in later years, however, I repented and began to enjoy the movie for its unique merits. The plot still seems a wee bit convoluted (but it does makes a weird kind of sense if you hold your mouth just right), and the intriguing human drama never runs out of steam. Above all else, from a dramatic standpoint, Dogora showcases the talents of American-bred actor Robert Dunham, who stars as the enigmatic (read silly) ""Diamond G-Man"" Mark Jackson. Though Dunham may have later shouted his way to something like fame as the emperor of Seatopia in Godzilla vs. Megalon, it's in Dogora that he really chews up the scenery and proves, once and for all, that Japanese soybeans have a nice flavor. Unlike most Caucasian actors in Toho productions, Dunham spoke excellent Japanese, which meant that his lines did not need to be dubbed for the Japanese language release. Thankfully, his dubbed voice in the English version preserves much of the humor present in the original, and if anything, the dubber's frequently exaggerated delivery makes the Mark Jackson character all the more memorable.

The cast of Dogora comprises many familiar faces from the pool of Toho regulars. Playing almost the same role he played in Ghidrah, The Three-Headed Monster, Yosuke Natsuki makes for a likable police detective named Komai, who first falls victim to trickster Mark Jackson, but eventually becomes an effective foil. In the course of his investigation, Komai meets an aging scientist and ""young soldier""--a gag that is repeated a couple of times in the film--named Munakata, who is working to develop artificial diamonds, hence his interest in a diamond-eating space monster. Komai also takes a romantic interest in Munakata's lovely assistant Masayo, played by Yoko Fujiyama, who is, as anyone who has seen Atragon can testify, the prettiest girl anyone has ever seen outside of a dream. Masayo also happens to be the sister of satellite mission control director Kirino, played by Hiroshi Koizumi, though his part is so small as to be nearly negligible.

The diamond thieves are a fairly colorful lot, led by a Mr. Big-type villain played by Seizaburo Kawazu. Akiko Wakabayashi, familiar to western viewers from her appearances in You Only Live Twice and What's Up Tiger Lily? (not to mention King Kong vs. Godzilla and Ghidrah, The Three-Headed Monster), plays her rather treacherous character with cat-like charm. And eccentric as always, Eisei Amamoto (best known as Dr. Who from King Kong Escapes and the ghostly ""prophet"" in Godzilla - Mothra - King Ghidorah - Giant Monsters All-Out Attack), renders some comic relief as Eiji the Safecracker. While the movie provides little in the way of well-rounded characters, the cast moves with the vitality typical of Toho's early-to-mid 60s fantasy fare, and as such can't help but be entertaining.

Eiji Tsuburaya's special effects are less extensive in Dogora than in many of his prior and subsequent efforts, but the film does feature a number of highly impressive sequences. The opening outer space scenes come off fairly well, highlighted by an eerie Akira Ifukube score. Most impressive are the shots of Dogora sucking columns of coal and debris into the sky-particularly once it has developed into its gigantic jellyfish form. Swirling cyclones form above piles of coal outside the huge refineries and draw the black matter skyward, the effect being utterly convincing. Certain other effects, though, such as a truck leaving the road and being drawn into the air, appear considerably less successful.

Dogora's most dramatic appearance comes late in the film, in the sky above Kyushu. Suspended in the air just as if it were floating in water, the immense creature lowers its perfectly articulated tendrils from the clouds, and with the use of obvious but interesting cartoon animation, destroys a suspension bridge. The model bridge does not rate as one of Tsuburaya's best miniatures, but the scene is the only major interaction between Dogora and the earthly environment. Given the airborne monster's remarkably lifelike aspect, the scene stands out as one of the highlights of the film.

Because of its unique and often peculiar storyline and characters, it's easy for modern audiences to hurl stones at Dogora. However, that very peculiarity also serves to make the movie all the more endearing should one be inclined to give it an opportunity. Tokyo Shock has once again given us a chance to enjoy a Toho monster movie in its original glory, and I will hereby happily give it a (radioactively) glowing recommendation.",1265500800,7,8032,5.107305936073059
2289263,4,B0009G3BPG,"When I say it is underrated, I mean its really underrated. This movie has a great atmospheric feeling to it, a brooding pace. It is a combination of Gangsters and Monsters. Robert Dunham is Mark Jackson working with the police to stop some diamond thieves. Meanwhile - Dogora (aka Dagora the Space Monster) comes to Earth and eats coal. The monster is a giant jellyfish which you can see it about 50 minutes in. That scene where you see the monster is awesome.
Media Blasters DVD is letterboxed Toho Scope style and you can watch it in English and Japanese. Great DVD.
If you like Japanese Kaiju films give this one a try. It used to be very obscure until its DVD release.",1236470400,2,672,4.471544715447155
2289264,3,B0009G3BPG,"Dogora is one of the most unusual monsters I've yet seen in a Toho 'kaiju' film. It's not given to wanton urban destruction like the rampaging beast that was Ghidorah. It's a hungry jellyfish-like creature, whose origins are never quite explained, who just wants the carbon it needs by plundering coal deposits and diamonds where it can find them. There's an intriguing array of strange phenomena building up to the monster's first major sighting and sufficient suspense until we get a handle on what kind of monster it is and what it looks like. When it finally makes a full-fledged assault on the coal deposits of Kyushu, the resultant collateral destruction is quite picturesque indeed. (The bridge-pulling scene is just breathtaking.) And the special effects scenes of Dogora hovering over Kyushu are among the most beautifully composed shots I've seen in any of the films for which Eiji Tsuburaya directed the effects.

However, such a monster doesn't quite provide the unabashed thrills we expect from a Japanese monster movie. Without a ""good guy"" monster like Godzilla or Gamera to oppose Dogora, there are only standard-issue military battles, with Japanese SDF troops firing artillery endlessly and uselessly at the sky. And when a diligent professor finally devises a scientific method to combat Dogora, it's pretty far-fetched and not terribly cinematic, leading to a distinctly anti-climactic finale. To make matters worse, too much of the action is taken up with a subplot involving a clichd band of gangster movie diamond thieves who try to take advantage of Dogora's diamond-grabbing activity. During the final stage of the effort to neutralize Dogora, the movie shifts to a much less interesting shootout on a beach between the diamond thieves and the police. It's as if, during the climactic monster battle in a Godzilla film, the action suddenly shifted to a lover's quarrel on the outskirts of Tokyo. It might be interesting in another movie, perhaps, but not this one.

One bonus of DOGORA for longtime kaiju fans is the chance to see American actor Robert Dunham in a major role, as Japanese-speaking insurance investigator Mark Jackson. Dunham appeared in a handful of Japanese monster and sci-fi films whenever a westerner was called for (e.g., MOTHRA, GODZILLA VS. MEGALON, as well as the all-western cast in THE GREEN SLIME), but we almost never heard his real voice. Thanks to the inclusion of the original Japanese soundtrack on this DVD, we get to hear him speak Japanese in his own voice, since the dialogue was recorded sync-sound. There's even a funny line by a Japanese detective questioning him who declares, ""I don't know where you learned Japanese, but you had a vulgar teacher.""

Also on hand is the beautiful Akiko Wakabayashi, known to western audiences for playing Aki, first of the two Japanese Bond girls in the fifth James Bond film, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967). Here she plays a sexy, duplicitous member of the robbery gang. The obligatory good girl counterpart is Masayo, the pretty assistant to the elderly scientist who takes the job of analyzing Dogora, and she's played by Yoko Fujiyama, who, alas, is given too little to do.

I liked the mix of extensive location shots with occasional studio sets and effects sequences that sometimes combine the two. It's visually well-crafted throughout and the print used for this DVD is very high quality. Overall, I just wish there'd been more of an emphasis on the monster and less on the diamond thieves.",1215993600,12,3494,5.029360967184801
2289265,3,B0009G3BPG,"Dogora is a decent movie. Personally, I have nothing against the movie. It is just more of a crime movie than a monster movie, which in this case, it is a good thing.

The acting and the special effects are, as usual, very well done. The character of Mark Jackson is very entertaining. But it just doesn't equal the Godzilla series or other Toho creations like Space Amoeba, Varan, Frankenstein vs. Baragon, The Mysterians, and others.

But don't let that spoil it for you. Buy this movie and enjoy it. It may not be the best monster movie, but it is a lot better than Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's Godzilla.

So buy the movie and enjoy. It is worth the price. Check it out! :)",1215561600,,681,4.388888888888889

2289268,4,B0009G3BPG,"Since none of the other reviewers mentioned her, I will because the mere presence of Akiko Wakabayashi alone, as the femme fatal, in Dagora is well worth the price. As James Bond's wife in You Only Live Twice she was the best part of that film too so get Dagora and enjoy her all over again. Anyhow, you can dismiss a number of the  other reviewers comments as worthless since they obviously have not really watched Dagora but rather just enjoy seeing their names on the internet. I say that because some of them mention Dagora sucking up diamonds and that is simply not true. The space alien critter actually sucks up massive amounts of coal then ejects huge diamonds, we assume as waste. It matters not because Akiko is running around looking super sexy and  that's what really counts throughout this fun film from Toho. Her co-star is American B actor Robert Dunham whose character as an international jewell cop is superfluous but also fun in a campy sort of way. The whole film is a hoot and while we don't get to see Akiko in a bath tub like in the Bond film  she is still an  eyeful.",1200096000,10,1090,4.435

2289270,3,B0009G3BPG,"This one is for Tohophiles only.  This rarely seen Japanese giant monster flick from the early sixties boasts very high production values, a nice ""forgotten"" Ifukube theme, a unique and very interesting kaiju, and stand-out effects work by Tsburaya and crew.  Dogora is a gigantic semi-tranlucent cross between a jellyfish and a squid - reminiscent of one of those sea creatures you've seen that lives at the very bottom of the deepest oceans. It floats in the upper atmosphere semi-concealed within a monsterous storm cloud, lowering itself to earth to suck tons of coal (and diamonds), on which it feeds. No obvious man in a rubber suit is this creation. It is very impressively realized by the Toho special effects team using a mix of marionettes, sophisticated optical work, and cell animation. Given a bigger budget with fewer and less outlandish effects set pieces, the talent of Toho's effects team during this period is really showcased in this film. Everything is a notch above in the effects department, and Dogora arguably has the best effects of the Showa era.

Despite this - and Honda's direction, this film is for Tohophiles only for it is a failed experiment. Seems crime dramas were popular at the time in Japan, along with giant monster movies. It is apparent Toho tried to marry the two, and the contrived story to make that marriage happen simply doesn't work. As others have alluded, it's like watching two different movies - a Japanese giant monster flick and a 60's diamond heist drama. There are long lags between effects sequences and the diamond heist crime drama ""movie"" is too slowly paced, dated, foreign, and not very involving.

As a result - despite what might be the greatest kaiju of them from Eiji Tsuburaya and its evocative and menacing execution, Dogora is a ""one off""  kaiju and the film itself (it pains me to say) deservedly forgotten. It is, however, absolutely recommended to Tohophiles who are hooked on the  kaiju films from the 60's, for its outstanding effects work, forgotten Ifukube score, and its curio value.",1171065600,4,2059,4.9193083573487035
2289271,4,B0009G3BPG,"All I can add to the previous adorations of this archetypical 1960's atomic monster movie is that Dagora kind of looks like somebody took a fake vomit from a gag shop, and then sprayed on some glue, glitter, & rhinestones.  My favorite scene is when the gangsters are ""casing"" an apartment building from their Corvair-like car & the police approach them, asking what they're doing there, hanging out.  The woman among the gangsters gestures at an open window with its curtains blowing through.  The men of the gang all giggle and one of them says ""She's airing out her room,"", which sends the police on their way.  Why this still seems so absurdly funny nearly 40 years later, I can't tell you...",1144022400,,696,4.680327868852459
2289272,5,B0009G3BPG,"I'm glad I finally got to see this film. Dogora is interestingly represented using both props and animation. It's a little short on extras, but contains the most obvious ones: the original Japanese theatrical trailer and a photo gallery.",1130457600,2,237,5.102564102564102

8060200,4,B0009G3BPG,"Dogora has the Toho feel to it, which I can't get enough of lately. However, it does drag on from time to time, and you only ever see Dogora in its jellyfish form for about a minute. The rest of the movie is mostly about diamond thieves and the monster is only tied to the plot because it eats carbon as an energy source. As a monster movie it's okay, but it's not excellent.",1520121600,,375,4.081081081081081

8060202,4,B0009G3BPG,"A Nice low key Kaiju film from the prolific year of 1964. A crazy mashup of diamond heist crime film and space monster film. Slow moving at times, but anything showa period is OK with me. Includes the English dub from the 1964 TV release.",1500768000,,238,4.311111111111111
8060203,3,B0009G3BPG,"Dogora is about a mutated space cell that feeds on carbon based materials such as coal and diamonds. Compared to the movies of today, the pacing can be pretty exhausting. The titular creature is quite interesting though and every scene that it's in seems eerie and like nothing I've ever seen. There is one scene that really sticks out where it's appendages come down from the sky and destroy a bridge. I have no major complaints about this movie but it wasn't the most interesting movie out there. I'm glad I watched it though as the creature will stay in my memories for many years to come.",1470528000,2,592,4.542056074766355

8060205,3,B0009G3BPG,"Part sci-fi flick, part caper, featuring a gang of jewel thieves running around trying to steal shipments of diamonds, while a protoplasmic space cell is after the same diamonds.........to eat.  In fact, the space blob will eat anything that is carbon based.  Its not picky; coal will work just as well as diamonds.
Strange movie, tries too hard with the thriller aspect, wasting precious little time on the creature from outer space.  As though Dogora was just an afterthought.
I was singularly unimpressed.",1463961600,,508,5.096385542168675
