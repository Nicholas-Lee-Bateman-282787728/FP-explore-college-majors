Although it was a Chow Yun Fat bundle I bought, this  was definately a Kent Cheung film. He wrote, directed, starred in and I  believe co-produced this film, and It is extremely good on so many  levels!
The camerawork is great and so are the sets (not something I  usually notice in Hk films, especially the dramas.). The script was  extremely well written and concerns A social workers meeting with Fat Cat  (cheung), a mentally retarded man who lives with his mother. The social  worker tries her hardest to help Fat Cat and his mother through her agency,  and it causes her to reflect on her own family (which is even more messed  up!). Fat Cat's mother is also secretly very ill, and there is an incident  involving her that could bring tears from a stone. Chow Yun Fat has a minor  role, as the social workers boss. His part was actually written more than I  though it would be (probably due to his mere prescence), but it was by no  means a major role.
My only hangup about this film is it's conclusion.  Without giving anything away, this film tried too hard to be a tragedy, and  doing that is fine, but the ending was quite unbelievable. Overall a fine  piece and great acting from Kent Cheung! ERic Tsang has a small role in  this film, thank god it was small! He has become my new HK film nemesis! He  is beyond annoying! Reccommended!",953078400,,1587,4.354948805460751

The real focus of  this film however, is Kent Cheung. He is amazing as a mentally retarded man  living in a HK villa with his mother. He is a good son, and is still  harassed by local thugs. He is brought some help by a social worker who  wants to get Cheung (named 'Fat Cat') and his mother some help. They live  so modestly, and cause the social worker to question her own life, and  family problems. I would hate to give away what happens, but i'll just say  that Fat Cats mom is severely ill, the bullies do not stop, and there are  many parts of the film which could bring tears from a stone! Chow yun fat  also has a very pivitol role as the film progresses (which worried me in  the beginning).
My only hangup about this film was the apperance of Alan  Tam (my new Hk enemy, he is So annoying in every film he is in that he  almost brings each one to a standstill!).
All in all, very worth the  viewing. Kent Cheung won the Hk best actor award for his performance, and  deservedly so! He was also the director, and many of the shot setups,  camera angles and set decor is amazing! I'd take this film over a million  'Forrest Gumps', this film is so simple, and in that says so much more!",949363200,,1393,4.0661764705882355
