Don't forget that left hand independence is the heart of this style, so be prepared to try your best to do your ""boring"" repetitional homework to make the LH rock solid.  Every sentence she speaks contains wisdom.  Low and loud notes set the rhythmic impetus, just like the bass player and a drummer in a band, and they MUST be solid.  EVEN SO, if ya can't do it quite yet with the left hand, the right hand ideas give you plenty of exploratory possibilities for informal use.",1505692800,,592,4.306306306306307
8538273,5,B009A881N6,I really love her style of teaching it is really great and laid back too bad she didn't do more instructional video's.  I think to get the most you don't need to read music but you should know the layout of where notes are as she says put your thumb on c pointer on eb etc. nothing too advanced on the video and a lot of good suggestions and examples.,1452470400,,351,4.014285714285714

8538276,5,B009A881N6,"I've been following Ann Rabson's music legacy with Saffire and as a solo pianist since the mid 90s. This DVD was a very good introduction to Ann's very own style and artistry. It was very nice to see her in a more intimate setting opposed to interviews and live performances. Here she explains and breaks down every single chord, riff, solo, beat and so on. She practically shares her own formula !!!
If you are into blues piano or you are a beginner playing blues, this is a very nice start, GET THIS !!!",1387065600,3,505,4.382978723404255
8538277,4,B009A881N6,"Although the video is not made for advanced or pros, and I am talking as a teacher and advanced player I liike this video because it goes straight to the point with many left hand patterns and then fills them up with some right licks and scales. Very easy to follow and very fast to learn them. And it also gives you in total 6 styles to play, so after watching and playing it a few times you get to know some basics for 6 rock blues based styles. I recommend to anybody who wants to get some interesting licks and good left hand patterns to jam around",1379462400,5,552,4.12037037037037
8538278,5,B009A881N6,"This DVD is full of original content. No elementary stuff, like explaining 12 bar blues, blues scale etc. It jumps right into the middle and teaches you the hardest part after you develop some hand independance and learned the basic concepts: how to sound real bluesy. All songs on this DVD (each based on interesting bass line) are sort of generic, fit for a wide range of blues tunes. All very driving and encouraging your own musical ideas. So, by learning six songs you actually learn to play in several blues piano styles. The instruction style is very clear and to the point. Absolutely transparent even for a not native English speaker like me.
Conclusion: this DVD is a way ahead of those best on the market (by David Cohen and Dr John), however it is not for absolute beginner.",1319760000,10,786,4.621428571428571
8538279,5,B009A881N6,Ann Rabson's got a whole lot of soul in her! It's a lot of fun to sit by and play along to what she's got to offer. Buy this DVD!,1310947200,4,129,3.3333333333333335
