8590374,5,B00D7DTTOA,"I gave this DVD a 5 because perfect quaity, but the one I got was the same DVD as The Girl Who Ran Away. There is nothing on the dvd I got with new stuff. There is not one scene with her in the green dress on the cover & non of the scenes of the back cover. I contacted Amazone they are sending a replacement. I hope this the right dvd in the case. But if it's the same DVD as The Girl Who Ran Away, I'll just return it, because I already own that one. I want to see new stuff.

Review update: I got the replacement but it was still the same. This is the same dvd as The Girl Who Ran Away dvd, I sent mine back because I already own that one. Don't be fooled by the cover.",1395360000,3,672,3.699300699300699
