2857673,2,B000R349HK,"I really wish I could recommend this. There was some novelty to it, and they tried hard. The sets and costumes were first rate, for whatever that is worth. The major problem was the actor chosen to portray Holmes - too old, too soft, too nice, and way too grandfatherly. Totally unbelievable as Holmes. And the Irene Adler problem is also a PROBLEM. Too bad .......... it's fun where it coulda been great fun. ;-(",1223856000,5,413,4.52
2857674,3,B000R349HK,"I never could see Jonathan Pryce as Holmes myself but he was the only good thing about this otherwise sterile family drama that seems like it was made for CITV or CBEEBIES. There's absolutely no bloody atmosphere to it.

Holmes' trusty Baker Street kids lose their leader when he apparently drowns in the Thames and the victim's sister begins to turn against Holmes claiming that he doesn't really care for them. But he still needs them to carry on working for him since he's in the middle of a difficult case.

It's not the best of plots and the acting from the majority of the cast would make the 'actors' in Hollyoaks cringe. Watson barely has anything to do, the stupid slow motion and editing techniques do not fit the context and the music is completely anachronistic, if terribly dull. The production design was pretty though, it has to be said.

For Sherlock Holmes fans and very young kids only.",1213142400,3,904,4.6375
2857675,2,B000R349HK,"While this Sherlock story will probably appeal to families with older kids, the hardcore Sherlock fan will be appalled. As mentioned in other reviews, the villainess shares the name of a beloved character from the Sherlock stories, but none of her marvelous traits. Furthermore, Jonathan Pryce, while a fine actor, seems very out of character for Sherlock, seeming much too like a sweet older gentleman than the proud, somewhat aloof Holmes.

The action focuses on the Irregulars and the story seems to try to pander to a young audience with this crew. Unfortunately, for the first half of the story, I found it difficult to have much interest in them. By the second half, as I accepted the movie for what it was, I did find some humor and charm in it.

As mentioned by others, there are some really good lines. There's also some really intriguing camera work that reminded me of some of the more experimental moments in the Granada series (like in the Devil's Foot, for instance) and a good soundtrack.

When I was able to pretend it wasn't supposed to be a Sherlock Holmes story, I enjoyed it as much as I'd enjoy most movies geared towards a tween audience. But I don't intend to ever watch it again.",1203552000,23,1203,4.63849765258216
2857676,5,B000R349HK,"I really am sick and tired of the ""Sherlock Holmes Purists"" who debunk anything that doesn't fit into their narrow view of what Holmes should be. If you don't like it, then don't watch it.
This is a two part TV movie that is released on DVD. I found the story line entertaining and fun to watch. The kids (while not ""filthy street urchins"") are entertaining in themselves and their loyalty to one another is a pleasure to see. This is a good ""family"" movie that is entertaining and fun to watch. There is no gratuitous violence, language, or nudity. The story line is plausible and well written. Simply an entertaining movie for the entire family. No more, no less.",1194048000,,665,4.55
2857677,4,B000R349HK,"This was a tough call since I actually enjoyed this film even though, after giving it some thought, I really shouldn't have!

I agree with other reviewers who question the wisdom of making Irene Adler the arch villain here. Those who have read the original ""Scandal in Bohemia"" which introduces Sherlock's one lost love, will take umbrage with her depiction as a cold blooded killer. That is totally out of character.

Also, in an attempt to appeal to younger viewers, there were several obvious (and somewhat lame) anachronisms such as a reference to a ""search engine"" (I'm surprised they didn't use the word Google), and the kids letting loose with ""awesome"" and ""Duh"".  The use of roller skates, however, was actually fairly accurate, time-wise (I had to research it to see if it, too, was an anachronism but it wasn't!)

Finally, the focus was on the ""Irregulars"" instead of Holmes and Watson which, for me, wasn't as interesting.

Yet, all in all, it was STILL enjoyable! The sets were extremely well done and the acting was above average. And it was, after all, a Sherlock Holmes movie! The kids were likeable and the villains were vile ... definitely worth a look.",1193788800,7,1171,4.8059701492537314
2857678,1,B000R349HK,"Terrible plot that deviates incredibly from the Canon.  Nonsensical.  Irene Adler is ""the woman"", not a burglar.  Definitely not a Napoleon (Josephine) of crime.

As for the Irregulars, not a Wiggins in sight.  Cleanest bunch of late Victorian/early Edwardian street urchins ever seen.  Nice that diversity is exhibited (at least in the presence of a Chinese Irregular called Tea Leaf, who has a backstory that is about 100 years prescient for political correctness -- too bad they have to call the character Tea Leaf -- all the Anglos have real names).

If you have $20 and two hours to kill with low expectations, this is for you.",1190332800,19,632,4.850467289719626
2857679,4,B000R349HK,"There are a number of things in this movie for the Holmes purist to pick apart, the identity of the villain being just one, but in the name of being fair, there are some good points as well.
I was happy to see someone taking on the tough job of writing an new Holmes story that did not lift whole sections from the Doyle originals. Really, after you've watched the Six Napoleons with Jeremy Brett, do you really want to watch the same story with someone else as Holmes? So, even though the plot has some gaping holes in it, you have to give the writers a nod of thanks. New Sherlock Holmes projects have been few and far between lately.
The plot does take liberties with the original canon; since another reviewer has already spilled the beans there - with no spoiler alert, I might add, I'll move on. By the very nature of the story, Holmes is unable to do much in his own defense and Watson too is shoved off to the side to make way for the Irregulars. This definitely makes it a young adult/teen adventure movie and it does frustrate me when the Great Detective sits in Baker Street motionless while all this goes on. I liked the concept of Holmes being the prime suspect but it also puts the number one character on the shelf.
Jonathan Pryce is all right as Holmes but, no disrespect intended, I wish he were a bit younger for this role. He does capture Holmes' impatience with the slower intellects around him and he has several great lines - especially the one about 'celebrity being the last refuge of the imbecile.' That alone is worthy of the Holmes we know and love. His relationship with the Irregulars is up and down; sometimes they give him no slack - or trust - which is somewhat surprising, given what they do for him in the Doyle stories. Sometimes Holmes is extraordinarily patient with them, especially the abrasive Sadie, who is an actively annoying character. Watson is well played by Bill Paterson, a loyal, jolly soul who is not above smiling smugly as Holmes jabs at Scotland Yard. Watson is not buffoon in this one and that's all to the good.
The Irregulars are a mixed bag; there are a couple of promising young actors, particularly Finch, and a couple who are really not very good at all. Some Americanisms creep into their speech and the net result is they really don't seem like the 'street arabs' Conan Doyle described but more like modern teens out on a lark.
Bottom line; if you're looking for another Holmes movie to be just as good as the Jeremy Brett series, this isn't it. There is a lot to find fault on and pick apart. But if you'd like some new Sherlock Holmes video to watch and you can be flexible enough to stand some revisions to the Canon, you might want to give this one a try.",1190073600,6,2721,4.4115308151093435
2857680,1,B000R349HK,"In deference to Never the Twain:  Very mild plot spoiler in this review-- definitely doesn't affect overall plot.

I am always on the lookout for a new Sherlock Holmes movie.  I couldn't wait until this came out, because it looked good and it was produced by the BBC-- which also produced the wonderful and never-to-be-duplicated Jeremy Brett series.

What a disappointment this was!

First of all, the villain here is Irene Adler. Why on earth was Irene Adler made the villain?  Adler was the only woman Holmes ever really respected and thought he could care about. And, in the Scandal in Bohemia, she clearly isn't a villain. She wrote Holmes a wonderful and caring letter and both Holmes and Watson were left with deep reverence (or at least respect) for her.  She is ""The Woman"" in Sherlock Holmes' life and was never, ever villainous at all.

So, why did the BBC or the scriptwriter or WHOMEVER make Irene Adler one of the most evil and diabolical villains to ever exist?  This really is an outrage, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan.  There is nothing in any past Holmes story to indicate that Irene Adler would ever turn into a murderous, conniving, vindictive evil villain.  At the end of ""Scandal in Bohemia"", we are all convinced she is a good, honest, savvy person who earned the respect of Holmes.  This was such a disappointment that, had the rest of the movie been actually good, it still would have ruined it for me.

Why not make Moriarty the villain? It is clear from some comments Watson makes that Moriarty is still alive. There is no reason to impugn Irene Adler's legacy by making her this type of villain.

Secondly, the casting was not very good. Jonathan Pryce is a good actor, but there was nothing about him that made him Sherlock Holmes. He definitely didn't 'own' the character.  Of course, once you are hooked on Jeremy Brett, nobody can ever really be good enough.  But, still, Pryce was 'just a detective'-- there was nothing about his acting that made you believe he was Sherlock.  He wasn't brilliant. He wasn't extraordinary. There was nothing at all about him that was special.  And, the character (as created in this film) made one or two comments about others' lack of intelligence.  Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes would never do this.

The actor playing Watson, on the other hand, was fine.  A little bit jolly, but definitely not insultingly doltish as portrayed in other films. Mrs. Hudson was sadly missed here.

Third, I think this is a television pilot.  I'm not sure, but it seemed so. This entire movie seemed to be a setup for a future family-friendly series about the Baker Street Irregulars.  Holmes talks to them about how they should be taking care of themselves for when he isn't around anymore and there are a couple of plot lines that are clearly left open for a future story.  If this is a planned television series, the casting department certainly needs to recast some of the Irregulars' parts.  Most were decent, but there was one shorter boy that wasn't very good and Sadie, the lead Irregular, was horrible. She was so horrible that it was hard to have any empathy at all for her character.

All in all, I really wouldn't recommend this.  It's definitely not for the Holmes purist, and I doubt it's for too many others, either. Even with the pre-teen and teen protagonists, I can't imagine too many parents anxious to push this as the first Holmes introduction to their children.  The embalming might make some parents decide against this. Personally, I would let my preteen and teen watch this if it was good, but I don't think there would be any benefit to do so. It's just not worth recommending at all.

Instead of buying this, get absolutely anything with Jeremy Brett. And, if you've watched all of those, try the Murder Rooms.  Those are excellent.

Edited to add: One reviewer here, referring to my review, believed that my review was a spoiler because I mentioned Irene Adler.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Irene Adler is mentioned as the villain in other reviews elsewhere and we find that out early on (and expect it the second Watson lets us know that Irene Adler is filed under ""evil villains"" in their filing system). The mystery is actually catching Irene and trying to figure out how she's doing what she's doing-- and why.",1189987200,24,4306,4.683510638297872
8198663,4,B000R349HK,A charming and fun two part Holmes mystery from the perspective of the group of urchins known as the Baker Street Irregulars that Holmes used as his eyes and ears on the streets of London. It is great to see the Irregulars get a central role in a Holmes spin-off story that also features many of the most-loved elements of Conan Doyle's original stories. Anna Chancellor is fantastically sinister and scary as Irene Adler.,1514505600,,422,4.716216216216216

8198672,4,B000R349HK,"background:  i've read all the books, loved BBC's wonderful update, ""Sherlock,"" and dug the Guy Richie film as well.  I watched this with my 8-year old, and it was cute, clever, and quite well-done for an obviously low-budget affair.  The focus is on the kids, and Holmes is more of a clever schoolteacher figure, so I don't think ""Irregulars"" would be a great watch if there are only adults in the room. (grownups:  get ""Sherlock"" instead!!!)
  The final scene is priceless-all that's missing is sunglasses!  (I don't want to ruin it, so you'll just have to watch it!)",1297036800,,569,4.744897959183674
