1686762,5,B0000633EW,"This is by far the most comprehensive and easy to understand bass instructional video I've seen. Alex's teaching style allows you to learn the slap technique whether you are able to read music or not.  He gives you plenty of options. Along with the tape comes a mini-book of transcriptions for each lesson. In the video itself he talks about the technique, then proceeds to demonstrate the technique.  With each technique, he shows it to you very slowly at first, then speeeds it up and plays along with the drum machine.  The video also shows you the techniques in split screen mode so that you can focus on the right and the left hand separately.  He then takes the concepts and demonstrates them in a band setting, i.e., a live drummer and guitar player.  His teaching style gives you the ability to easily develop your own grooves.  If you follow this tape step by step, you will surprise yourself within just a few days of serious practice. This tape is head and shoulders the best tape I've seen.  It will save you hundreds of dollars in lessons. This tape is a must have in any bass intruction collection. In addition, Alex has some serious chops!",1086393600,5,1154,4.6
1686763,5,B0000633EW,"You're here reading this review probably cause you're a bass player and you're seeking video instructional tapes. Let me tell you this. I consider myself an average player. I've been playing too much fingerstyle for about 8 years now but have no idea how do people out there play those fast rythmic patterns so smoothly. Well, this video solves a big part of the riddle. It tells you about complex damping and choking <which I loved so much>, funk patterns and vamps, ""machine-gun"" triplets, etc... Yes, I do have a lot of instructional tapes. None can beat this one when approaching the subject of Slap bass. Definitely NONE.
If you're an enthusiastic young player like me, this video will keep you busy for a couple of weeks, even months to really master what's on the tape here. Regardless of what your level is, I believe this tape will add a lot to your approach to the Bass. I didn't graduate from a music institute but the music notes supplied with the video were very clear and helpful and it gave me a good insight about the academic background of those styles being played.
If you're a beginner, I would also recommed you to buy this tape. It will introduce you to the world of Slap without complications. May be you will just need more time to master those techniques but it's only a matter of time and you'll reach there.
The tape is worth every penny paid. Please tell me where can I find people who are willing to reveal all those secrets for this amount of money.... Alexis has a wonderful style in putting it all together. He takes you in a step-by-step program. Before watching this video, all I could do was straight thumb and pluck, simply Dom-Dum-DomDom-Dum. After following this program, you'll be amazed by the the complex bass lines you can play smoothly. The production quality is wonderful and the dual screen-shots give you a very clear scene. I bought also the rest of the series for Video Progressions. ... I hope they will be as good as this one.
This is my first review on Amazon so please note if it was helpful. Peace.",1063497600,56,2050,4.558265582655826
1686764,5,B0000633EW,"This video is a great tool, as it takes you very thoroughly from the fundamental technique all the way to very advanced approaches.
The instruction is concise and very clearly articulated, and Mr Sklarevski gives a very slow, steady introduction which becomes a bit faster later on in the video. All examples are shown slowly and then progressively faster, eventually leading into several groove sessions with a live band, where all the examples are used together in a peice of music.
Close-up dual screen shots enhance the viewer's experience by allowing you to see exactly what is being done, and where. Since the basics are introduced slowly, there is no chance for you to miss what was done.
Altogether, this is a wonderfully done instructional tape, with no interviews and the blah blah you would find in most other videos (or at least ALL of the other bass videos I've seen).
BRAVO!!

1686765,5,B0000633EW,"I play bass guitar in an indie rock band in southeast pa.  I am always looking for new sounds to add in, so I picked up this video.  The thing is sooooooo goooood.  Here we have this incredible bass player, who not only plays some clean CLEAN fast fast superfast slap bass, but can also slow it down to show exactly what he is doing.  Then he breaks into these sweet jam sessions with his buddys.  The entire thing takes place in the 80s, which accounts for some...interesting...hairstyles.
I would reccomend this to anyone....welll......that is, anyone who plays bass.  It's definately more suited for bass players than... say......soccer players.

1686766,5,B0000633EW,"To be honest, I shied away from this tape because of the price. What a mistake. I ended up wasting money on several other tapes, so I wish I bought this one to begin with, since it's likely the only one you'll ever need. It is without a doubt the BEST slap bass tape available, and perhaps THE BEST of all bass instructional tapes. Other tapes have amazing musicians saying, ""Okay, do this,"" and you don't know what the hell they're doing. Sklarevski is not only an amazing musician, but he's a sensational teacher, clearly and concisely taking you through a step-by-step program, building upon previous lessons until one day, you find yourself improvising and coming up with original bass lines that you didn't know you had in you. You're not memorizing riffs; you're learning an impressive approach to the bass that you can apply to any music. For instance, I learned how to play more like Flea from this tape than from Flea's tape. Personally, I have little natural musical talent, but thanks to Sklarevski, people think I'm a musical genius. If you're thinking about buying this tape, stop thinking and make the purchase. Think of it as an investment in becoming an outstanding musician. I can assure you that you will be knocked out by the results.",1026345600,15,1253,4.726027397260274

Unlike other videos that teach you the basics of everything, if you want pure slap/pop instruction, this is the video to get - no other! The program is very well structured from the very basics to the very advanced like triple plucks and ""four fingers / one string"" and the cameras are placed strategically so that the viewer can see exactly what his right hand and left hand are doing.
I dare say that if you work hard on the techniques here, you will be open to almost unlimited possibilities in your slap/pop playing. Go and order your copy and consider it an investment that will definitely pay for itself.",1020038400,8,743,4.511111111111111

It is very comprehensive, starting with the basics and running up to some very advanced lines.  Although this course is ideal as an introduction to slap style playing, there is something here for any bass player no matter how advanced.  All exercises are explained clearly and the lines are written out on screen as well as in the booklet.  Alexis is a great instructor and has amazing feel for funk/slap playing.

I have the VHS version and I wanted to upgrade to a DVD. The VHS version is of much better quality. I'm not quite sure what happened in the transition to DVD. If it wasn't for the quality factor, I would have given it 5 stars. You will not be disappointed in the knowledge that you gain from this video!",1406505600,,438,4.226190476190476
1686773,5,B0000633EW,"If you listen and even watch slap bass playing it is often difficult to understand  what is going technically.
This DVD cannot make it more easier for you to get it at first sight.

Do not worry about the fact that this video was recorded in the 80's.
It has been for me a very effective way to learn slap bass.

This DVD is extremely well done and will make you understand and learn slap bass from a beginnner to an advanced level.

To buy this DVD is definitively the best first step to take if you are serious about learning slap bass.  You can then find more slap bss transcriptions on the market.

It seems that Alexis Sklarevski is not in the publishing market anymore.  I do not understand why as I consider him the best reference for beginners at slap bass.",1405382400,,765,4.3076923076923075

1686778,5,B0000633EW,"I have been playing the bass for less than 1 year. I'm taking lessons and as some of you may know it can be kind of a slow process. To become more familiar with the bass I starting listening to Victor Wooten, Marcus Miller, Stu Hamm, Jaco Pastorius and many others. I was amazed by the sounds and rhythms they created, but could see how it was done (I'm a visual learner). The Slap Bass Program was what I needed. Can I now play like these guys?? No way. I've only had the program for about 3 weeks and it'll probably take me a lifetime to understand half of what they know. But Alex Sklarevski's teaching has opened my eyes to a style of bass playing that fun and creative. I look forward to each lesson on the DVD after I finish my regular classes (still have to learn the basics). I would recommend The Slap Bass Program to anyone at any level.",1370563200,,847,4.2024539877300615

1686788,4,B0000633EW,"Although the video seems to be straight out of the '80's, its still relevant for Bass Guitar players who are looking to push their playing style into different and/or more challenging areas than just playing whole or quarter notes with a garage band.  As a bass player who fingers/plucks the strings, the method of slapping the guitar with the side of your thumb was completely foreign (although I've since learned that many bass players use this method - notably Flea from The Red Hot Chili Peppers), as I grew up modeling my playing style (if not skill level) after Geddy Lee of Rush.  Even for one such as myself who had NEVER played this style before, the video takes you slowly enough through the elemental steps of how to slap, how to create a slap rhythm, and how to build on these rhythms to add to the other instruments in the band so that you don't get lost.  I'm sure that even with a small amount of practice, this method could be easily learned through the video.  Unfortunately, as a 39-yr old adult with a full-time job, I don't have time for practice and one 2-hr stint with the video made my thumb hurt for over a month.  However, this is my issue and not the fault of the video.  Seems to me that a teenager/young adult with time on his/her hands could very quickly master the exercises and excel in this method.

Bottom line is this is an exceptional video.  Only drawback is the $40 sticker price - however it appears that this price range is not abnormal for music instruction videos, so...",1243296000,,1511,4.489051094890511

Why don't all instructors take this much care in creating teaching materials?  You can actually use this to learn slap bass technique, not just watch some guy impress you with his chops.  He takes you one logical step at a time and gradually brings you up to speed on each aspect of slapping.  He starts each topic at a very slow tempo then speeds up a little at a time while the camera captures his technique from different angles, including a split screen perspective where you can view his plucking and fretting hands at the same time. The fact that the video was made long enough ago that the hair and clothing styles may be a little dated is irrelevant; his teachings are timeless and Alex is an encouraging instructor with a humble and supportive demeanor.

I like the way he really breaks down the exercises so you understand.  I also like the split-screens of the left and right hands, so you can see exactly what's he's doing.

1686797,5,B0000633EW,"Before I viewed the Slap Bass Program, I was an absolute beginner in the bass.  I had just bought an entry-level bass guitar and I didn't know squat about how to play it

Inside of 2 and a half weeks after viewing the video, I was slapping and popping with decent speed using variations of the blues scale.  What this video does is set you up with excellent fundamentals in slap-pop technique.  The tape is densely packed with exercises and demonstrations.  No wasted moments. Alexis speaks precisely and emphasis key points without fluff.  He starts out with right hand technique with some very useful camera closeups.  Then he goes on to some very basic octave patterns.  Then he moves on to the blues scale, left-hand muting, machine-gun triplets, and double stops.  Near the end of the tape, he gets into some very difficult right hand techniques that will take years to master.

What the tape does not do is make you into a slaptastic slapinator supreme.  After learning the basic techniques, you'll have to use other resources to refine your slap-popping, hammering, pull-offs, and muting (muting is hugely critical) in other musical contexts.  Also, you'll have to learn some music theory with other resources because although Alexis does speak some about the blues scale in relation to funk, he doesn't go into much depth about jazz theory.  This is largely a technique oriented resource, not a how-to on improvisation.",1141257600,3,1427,4.920502092050209
