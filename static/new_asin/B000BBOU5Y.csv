2411063,5,B000BBOU5Y,"This workout is great!  I started by using Vanessa Isaac's Samba Party vol. 1 for a month and then tried this one.  I was really surprised how much she stepped up the pace with vol. 2... surprised in a good way!  I thought I was working hard with vol. 1, but it took me 2 weeks of dancing to vol. 2 before my muscles stopped screaming at me every workout.  The dancing is even more fun than vol. 1 with all new moves except for your basic move.  She'll have you grape-vining, doing some more complicated fast steps, doing a new samba box, cha-cha-cha'ing, and moving your hips around in a fun party step.  I love alternating between vol. 1 & 2 now and my stamina is definitely improved after adding this volume!  Definitely buy these DVD's (or VHS's)... they're super fun and they WORK... I'm getting compliments on looking thin and I know my tummy's tighter and legs are in great shape!",1179705600,10,887,4.404907975460123
2411064,3,B000BBOU5Y,"The music and the location are about the only thing that has anything to do with the Samba.  So in that regard it was disappointing.  The music is great and it is a good workout, but is not the Samba.  So if you are looking to learn the Samba look elsewhere this is not it.  It is simply a great workout to Samba music.",1174435200,5,319,3.9375
2411065,4,B000BBOU5Y,I am enjoying this DVD very much for a work out.  The instructions are fairly easy and the dance is authentic as I lived in Brazil and learned to Samba there among the people. I wish there were a little more variation on the same DVD but I guess they saved that for the next DVD.,1170806400,3,279,3.982142857142857
2411066,4,B000BBOU5Y,"The first thing I noticed was the set. The video is filmed outdoors at night with live drums. Add in instructor Vanessa Isaac & company's vibrant costumes, and you do get a lively ""Carnaval"" party feel.

Isaac is great with cuing, always letting you know what's coming up. However, beginners may have trouble getting the footwork down. There is a seperate feature independent of the workout that shows you individual Samba moves in slow mo and at tempo so you can practice and get more comfortable with the steps...very helpful if the choreography confuses you. The nice thing about the video is that Isaac encourages you to add your own flair and expression to the moves, rather than doing them exactly as she does.

The workout itself is energetic, more traditionaly ""dancey"" with cha cha cha's, box steps, grapevines, turns, all with a Samba touch. There is a basic move you can always go back to if you get lost. You can adjust the intensity of your workout by exaggerting the steps and incorporating your arms more. Isaac starts with a thorough warm up, followed by about 30 min. of Samba, and then closes with a relaxing cooldown.

There is also a special feature interviewing the backup dancers about Samba, and what benefits they think users of the video will walk away with.

I really enjoyed the energy of this video. I love Latin dance, so being able to do the Samba as a workout was great! Very fun, and a nice deviation from traditional workouts.",1145232000,27,1459,4.6875

8084632,3,B000BBOU5Y,Good to learn the basic from this DVD but then it became too boring after awhile.,1409788800,,81,4.125
8084633,5,B000BBOU5Y,"I really love Vanessa Isaac's Samba DVD's.  She's very encouraging and fun to learn from in her videos!  This DVD is a good workout on its own, but if you pair it with Samba party workout one you get a wonderful hour long, full body workout, that won't make you cry, like cross-fit or P90X ect.  Working out doesn't have to suck, and Samba Party workout proves it.  You just dance, and kind of forget that you're working out at all.",1389657600,,432,4.296296296296297
8084634,5,B000BBOU5Y,I love to dance so this is a no-brainer when it comes to do some exercise I can stay with.  This is a great workout.  Gets the heart pumping and really works on the lower half.  Highly recommend.,1389484800,,195,4.078947368421052
8084635,5,B000BBOU5Y,simple easy to follow dance steps. Great for easy training days or just to get you moving. Put a smile on my face.,1368662400,,114,4.0
8084636,5,B000BBOU5Y,"This video was so much fun to do!  If you love dance and the Brazilian culture & rhythm, you will not regret getting this DVD.",1368403200,,126,4.04
8084637,2,B000BBOU5Y,"I was dancing to the workout but,get lost to fast. So,I stopped after 2 weeks.waste of money..spendit instead on austin videos. She is more details on what she is doing.",1271548800,,169,4.666666666666667
8084638,5,B000BBOU5Y,"I like this samba  workout as much as Vanessa's first.  My friends enjoyed it too when we did it together and they bought it along with her first DVD!
It's a good cardio and fun dance workout  for any day!",1247356800,,205,4.075
8084639,4,B000BBOU5Y,"If you liked Samba Party Workout 1, you'll like Samba Party 2 even more!  Some great new moves by Vanessa.  The workout is approximately 35 minutes with warmup and cooldown.  The set design is the same as Samba Party 1 and it still is my favorite background of all of the dance workouts I own.

If you have a carpeted surface, you will probably have a hard time with this workout...I just wear socks so that I can twist around without messing up my knees.  There's just one little hop in terms of impact.

I'm hoping for a Samba Party Workout 3 from Vanessa!!!

Recommend to high beginners and intermediates.",1198540800,4,608,4.472727272727273
8084640,4,B000BBOU5Y,"Vanessa had a previous dvd called ""Brazilian Dance Workout"" that had great ideas, but she didn't teach enough & used many stage-style complicated steps. This is her 2nd of the Samba workouts where she fixed those mistakes.
The menu options are: Guidelines, Complete workout, Workout chapters, Learning the moves, Interview with the Cast, About Brazil & Credits
It's set on the street with 5 girls dancing backup & live band on the sidewalk.
She teaches the steps not only in it's own menu option: basic move (easy watered-down samba), samba grapevine, samba box (more open regular box step), samba (samba easy step & raises heart rate), samba cha cha (cha cha w/a simple step out to each side easy) & samba double twist (hips twisted a little, feet never cross, more open easy then her vol. 1 samba twist) but also when she first introduces the dvd. She teaches in half times a few times with some basic cues which is enough to get it for almost anyone.
The pace is great, she doesn't let you take a break, only drop to basic easy slow-paced samba step in between. She builds up the 6 different steps into a routine.
The workout never stops, but it is watered down & the pace is good, but the moves are always executed a little more slowly then they would be normally,  wish there were more moves & the band is just percussion, I wish there was more instruments.
This is great for those who don't know how latin dance & moderately workout. Those who are in great shape & already know latin dancing might find this too easy both in pace & execution of the moves.

There's a trailer of this & her other dvds at: collegevideo",1184198400,14,1622,4.51360544217687
