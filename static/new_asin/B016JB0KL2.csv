7473111,4,B016JB0KL2,Awesome movie,1456531200,,13,6.0
7473112,2,B016JB0KL2,"Disappointing. Shown, without a narrator, from the view of a roving camera, I guess they call it POV. Shallow characters, suspenseful, but ultimately a disappointing ending. Would have been OK for Prime, not worth a $4.99 rental fee. The reviews I read made it sound better than it was. From now on, I'm sticking to movies with bigger-name stars who, hopefully, wouldn't appear in dung. No guarantee there either, I suppose. I'm just tired of this crapshoot, and relying on misleading customer reviews.",1456012800,,502,5.0602409638554215
7473113,5,B016JB0KL2,We enjoyed it. Yea the police search flaw in the Attic was confusing. But we thought all and all it was a creepy and engaging film. The entire idea of this move honestly was beyond brilliant.,1455667200,,191,4.333333333333333

7473115,3,B016JB0KL2,Suspenseful but played-out plot. Disappointing ending. Nice acting though.,1455408000,,74,7.333333333333333
7473116,4,B016JB0KL2,"When you watch this movie, you will either love it or hate it. I really liked it. Of course it has its flaws like every movie, but I was surely pleased. I think it's a brilliant story, I was definitely freaked out by it and I'm honestly afraid of being home alone after watching it. As far as the acting, it was flawless. I think it's a little odd how the mother's British and the rest of the family isn't, but you can't even tell that they're acting. Especially since the footage was all on the killers POV, it all seems real. Also the camera quality is very good. A lot people, including me, get bothered by the ""found footage"" style, but I think this movie was fairly good at it though. What bothered me the most, though, was how there was no information on why the killer was doing what he was doing. Even though it was all his perspective, I think the writers could've fit in a little information on the killers reasoning, and I think everyone else who watched this film was wondering the same. Other than that, I enjoyed this film and I think it's great how we, the viewers, got a sense of how the family was and we really learned to love them. I recommend it!",1455321600,,1166,4.256756756756757
7473117,2,B016JB0KL2,"Well, what started as an awesome idea, turned into a steaming pile of disappointment!  I'm not gonna lie, I'm a fan of Jeremy Sisto.  Ever since he threw out that, ""I can't find my Cranberries CD,..I need to go to the gym before someone snags it!"" in Clueless, I've dug him in movies.  I think it's just the fact that I get a chuckle every time I see him.  Regardless, this movie doesn't do him any favors.

Aaron (Jeremy Sisto) and Beth (Kate Ashfield), along with their two children Marley and Max have just returned from a two week vacation to find their home has been broken into and ransacked.  The family is obviously traumatized, so Aaron decides to set up some home ""defenses"".  First he calls for an alarm system to be put in and then for all the door locks to be replaced.  Later on, Beth encourages him to purchase a gun, although he seems scared to death of them?  That turns out to be a bad idea too (like we didn't see that coming).

What the family DOESN'T know, is the intruder has set up shop in their nice home and installed a plethora of cameras throughout the house to constantly monitor them.  When not watching the monitors, the intruder is either out video taping with a camcorder, or banging his head against the wall in some sort of tear filled rage?  It's really odd, to say the least?!

There are MANY things in this movie that don't add up, including the fact that after the discovery of the break in, the police search the entire house,...INCLUDING the attic.  Now, I know where he's hiding, but that would have been searched as well, as there would most certainly be an easy access to the point.  Either way, just some things that make the film less ""believe-able"".

Aside from everything I've stated, the movie never did completely bore me.  I watched it the same way as most, just was really disappointed that nothing ever actually happened.  This includes the ending.  Yes, you technically get the ending, but it's so abrupt, that once it happens, it's done.  Basically the family (in the movie) was REALLY dumb and this probably wouldn't happen to any real family,...or maybe it would?

Final Verdict:  Failed on nearly every level.",1455235200,2,2166,4.55699481865285
7473118,1,B016JB0KL2,Horrible.,1455235200,,9,9.0
7473119,2,B016JB0KL2,"First off, I am a huge fan of horror and, in particular, found footage films (and even more so, indie films). Despite having these kind of films on my radar, I'd actually never heard of this one (apparently it was straight-to-video). That proved to be a double-edge sword on this one. The upside to that was so I had no real expectations, short of the trailer. The downside is that I didn't read any reviews before renting...

PROS: This is very well shot by whoever the cinematographer was, with great audio (important in this film, as it was in Paranormal Activity). Also, the cast are all excellent actors. Each turns in a convincing performance, which is rare in these low budget FF movies. Also, the setup for this, plot-wise, is, while not novel (this movie's been done many times - 388 Arletta Ave being a recent example) is still interesting. There are also a couple of creepy moments.

CONS: 1) Plenty of unrealistic scenes. 2) The characters are shallow as written, the inexplicably tantrum-throwing ""villain"" is otherwise unremarkable and dull, 3) and the ending... I was going to post a SPOILER ALERT, but, unfortunately, here's where's the film dies out - there's nothing to spoil. The ending is a huge, huge letdown. 4) It's essentially a film in two parts. The beginning and middle and... then it kind of just goes on with the same events over and over. There's a guy hiding in the house, watching. That's about it. So, the setup is good, but it just slowly dies out in the last 20 minutes.

All in all, I would wait for this one to pop up on Netflix or Prime - definitely - and not spend $5 to rent it. Save it for a smarter version, such as 388 Arletta Avenue. If you've seen that movie, this one's almost exactly the same. But, where you felt a sense of investment in the Nick Stahl's character, you won't get that here. The only difference here is this bad guy sleeps in the attic.

Hardcore FF fans may enjoy the first 2/3 of the movie enough to be happy they rented it, but I definitely can't recommend it.",1455148800,4,2027,4.5
7473120,4,B016JB0KL2,"Four stars, rather than five because the plot has (kind of) been done before....but this film is brilliantly executed and well acted. Tension runs high and the creep factor is dialed up a notch as Jeremy Sisto plays a husband and father of two who experiences a break in while he and his family are on vacation. It appears the intruder has left and things seem to return to normal....but all the while the intruder is living in the family's attic!!

The movie begins as a creepy POV film similar to a ""Paranormal Activity"" film, although there are no ghosts here. The masked man is unsettling and, atypically for this type of film, there is one gruesome scene in particular that will make you cringe. In short, this film has all the elements...IF you are a fan of POV horror and suspense. If you're looking for a slasher or grindhouse type of film, you won't find it here. However, unlike countless films of this genre, this one has the goods and it'll keep you on the edge of your seat until the conclusion.",1455148800,,1008,4.508196721311475

7473142,5,B016JB0KL2,"Creepy as hell. This movie is a ""thinking mans'"" film. I love Jeremy Sisto and that was a good selling point. It slowly builds to an already concluded ending and it still was disturbing. There are no special effects to be had here. I think that is what makes sure you're invested. It reminded me of Hitchcock and his filming concept of the ""MacGuffin."" The audience is a participant and you can even show them where the film is going to scare the pants off of them.",1458259200,,465,4.35632183908046

8736541,1,B016JB0KL2,"Tedious horror movie about the serial killer of the title whose modus operandi is to move into a family's attic and spy on them with a multitude of hidden cameras, come out when they aren't around (and sometimes when they are--lurking just out of their sight), filming them in their sleep with a night vision camcorder and moving objects around in the house and leaving the juice out on the counter until he finally gets bored and moves in for the kill.  Unfortunately, the audience is likely to get bored way before the killer does.

Hangman is shot entirely with surveillance cameras and a camcorder so it's basically Paranormal Activity with a serial killer instead of ghosts.  To me this is an incredibly lazy way to make a movie and, like the Paranormal Activity films, about 90% of Hangman feels like home movies of the family doing mundane things that you would never consider filming in a conventional thriller.

If you find Paranormal Activity style movies tolerable then you might not hate Hangman.  I found it to be dull, lazy, unimaginative and pretty much completely free of anything that could be confused with suspense.  To make matters worse, the camera angles are so bad I couldn't even tell you for sure what most of the actors actually looked like.  Even the Paranormal Activity films aren't that awful.",1478131200,,1322,4.797356828193832
