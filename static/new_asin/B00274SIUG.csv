I remember Shane West in A Walk to Remember and loved him in it, so I wanted to give him a shot with this movie.  The concept behind the movie is pretty cool.  A super cell phone shows up and gives you tips on making quick money.  However, the storyline dips into unbelievable pretty quickly and the acting is subpar.  My husband and I laughed at the non-subtle hints of comparisons to our past administrations actions.  You'll notice the blatant picture of President Bush in several scenes.  A movie to watch if you don't have a good option at the rental store but I'd skip purchasing it.",1249948800,3,689,4.377952755905512
3858151,1,B00274SIUG,"Even though it looks like an important sum of money has been spent on making this movie -having been shot in Thailand, Prague, Moscow and the U.S.A.-, that isn't enough to keep the audience interested in following the unbelievable and typically low budget plot.

3858152,2,B00274SIUG,"I went in with no expectations and thought I might get lightly entertained. Instead I was subjected to a slew of poor to average performances, DVD quality on a Blu, no special features whatsoever, bad sound, the re-done story mentioned here and everywhere, the best performance not even being credited on the cover art, this constant location/text thing on the screen telling us the coordinates of each sequence (uh - who cares?), this bad freeze frame editing mixed with 1990s MTV music - wow I could keep going.

The performance to watch for is the great little seductress and lethal weapon role filled by the elegant Tamara Feldman. She gets to show her skin in the love scene but it still gets a PG in Canada and a PG13 here - gotta love it. The Blu had no selling point to voice here since it failed on picture quality, sound, lack of features supplemented by a film that would have been cool right after Enemy of the State, not Eagle Eye and ten others.

Normally, I do not go off on a movie this much but each sequence would get steadily worse than the previous. When you find yourself laughing at that 90s music score, bad action scenes, and fluffy writing, things begin to snowball. Maybe it is good for a rental, but do not test your new Blu system with this one; At the most a slow Sunday evening where you might want to see Martin Sheen or Ed Burns fill some roles.",1247875200,7,1377,4.417322834645669
3858153,3,B00274SIUG,"An unpleasant wave of dj vu swept over me as I watched ""Echelon Conspiracy,"" which tells the story of a secret, powerful government organization using a cell phone to control an unwitting young man. Was this not the plot of last fall's ""Eagle Eye""? Maybe it's a depressing sign of the times that writers Kevin Elders and Michael Nitsberg and director Greg Marcks ripped off a movie that wasn't all that good begin with. Both films are equally preposterous, but ""Echelon Conspiracy"" has the added distinction of being a rehash, and not a very good one at that. This is one of those rare instances where it's obvious that the actors don't care that much about what they're doing; even the great Martin Sheen can't seem to rouse himself to give more than a merely decent performance.

The story focuses on a Max Peterson (Shane West), a computer engineer from Omaha, Nebraska. While on business in Bangkok, he receives an anonymous package containing a cell phone so state-of-the-art, it isn't even on the market yet. Almost immediately, he begins receiving a manipulative series of text messages. This leads him to Prague, where he's ordered to stay at a fancy hotel and gamble huge sums of money at rigged gaming stations. This catches the attention of a former FBI agent named John Reed (Edward Burns), who now works as the head of the casino's surveillance team. It also catches the attention of Reed's former partner, Agent Dave Grant (Ving Rhames), who has been sent by an American government faction called the NSA.

While other Americans have received mysterious text messages, Max is the only one who hasn't been killed because of it. This leads the head of the NSA, Raymond Burke (Sheen), to believe that it his involvement has something to do with the activation of a homeland security system known as Echelon. How it was activated and why Max was chosen have yet to be determined; all he knows is that he's constantly under surveillance, and it seems he won't be let off the hook until he's served his purpose.

There comes a point when he meets a Russian hacker named Yuri (Sergey Gubanov), who doubles as a cab driver. He gives Max an earpiece that vocalizes his text messages; what we hear is a monotone female voice that sounds eerily similar to one that controlled Shia LaBeouf in ""Eagle Eye"" (provided by an uncredited Julianne Moore, which is just as well, especially if it happens to be her voice in this new film). Max also meets an undercover agent named Kamila (Tamara Feldman), who serves no real purpose other than looking sexy. This doesn't work too well for film that's rated PG-13, but never mind.

One of the film's most baffling casting choices is Jonathan Pryce as Mueller, the wealthy owner of the hotel/casino in Prague. He periodically appears to engage in cryptic, mildly threatening conversations with Reed, who he feels isn't doing a good enough job taking care of the Echelon problem. Why this character was deemed necessary, I have no idea. Other than an interesting metaphor about arrows and phoenix feathers, he contributes absolutely nothing to the story. I got the impression that Pryce was just as surprised by being cast; as is the case with Sheen, his performance has the air of someone not taking his role seriously. This might have worked had the film gone in a much campier direction.

Indeed, this film had the potential to be a lot of fun. The plot in and of itself is inherently escapist, not at all unlike the plot of your average summer blockbuster. But somehow, the elements weren't coming together; I never once felt as if I could just sit back put my brain on autopilot. In all fairness, the writers made a good start by giving the characters incredibly hokey dialogue, which seems to exist only as a way to get from one corny joke to the next. Consider a scene in which Max and Reed find themselves in the middle of a car chase: When Max asks, ""FBI crash course?"" Reed responds, ""Brooklyn childhood."" It seems films like this are entitled to one or two especially bad lines. Still, don't expect the audience's laughter to be anything other than incredulous.

The climactic final scenes take place in, of all places, Max's hometown, mostly in a concrete warehouse located in the middle of nowhere. Is it possible to genuinely care about a commentary on computer intelligence and government control in such a setting? Are commentaries even necessary in movies like this? I didn't think so in the case of ""Eagle Eye,"" and I certainly don't think so in the case of ""Echelon Conspiracy,"" a perfunctory story that pretends to be a lot bigger than it actually is. When an action/adventure film is this thin-blooded, it's difficult to understand why notable names are attached to it. One wonders: Did Martin Sheen see something in the screenplay that somehow didn't translate to the big screen? Did he actually believe that the whole technology-gone-awry idea would be properly developed? I shudder to think that a paycheck was the only motivating force.",1242518400,4,5001,4.789107763615296
3858154,3,B00274SIUG,"Very similar to last year's ""Eagle Eye,"" but with Shane West instead of Shia LaBeouf. This movie has a bit more intelligent script, but contains a lot less special effects (although there are several pretty good car chases). The theme of the U.S. government creating a machine for ""national security"" that then turns against them is nothing new and hardly science fiction these days, but the movies about it seem to be abundant.

While that is a great story line with lots of room for action, thrills, nuance and even warnings of the danger of technology dependence, with Echelon it simply requires to great a 'suspension of disbelief' to ignore the plot holes, contrived situations and pure coincidence that the movie depends on (not to mention several technical continuity issues).

Now you're beginning to grasp the dire waste of time that is Echelon Conspiracy. A very small child could have done a better job of writing the script. It's perhaps condign that a movie about a machine should be so terribly mechanical, but it doesn't make for a rewarding viewing experience.

Perhaps if you've recently been lobotomized, this might make for interesting viewing. Or perhaps if you're in a coma it might be acceptable background noise.

3858169,3,B00274SIUG,"For the first 40 minutes, I was mesmerized by this film. The beginning was as thrilling and intriguing as any film I'd seen all year, but after that, the big secret is revealed and it became almost a shot for shot remake of Eagle Eye. It was seriously ridiculous how the two stories became almost exactly alike. Realizing this, the writers decided to throw in a big twist at the end, that might have saved the film had it made even a single bit of sense. Echelon Conspiracy begins with computer programer, Max Petersen (Shane West), anonymously receiving a brand new, state of the art, cell phone in the mail. The phone gives him instructions which lead to him winning a lot of money. Everything is going great for Max, until he disobeys the phones wishes and the FBI shows up. Shane West was fantastic in this film, it really makes me wonder why he doesn't do more stuff like this. West seems to prefer romantic dramas, but is clearly missing his true calling. After seeing a performance like this, I'd easily put him at the top of the list for any major action film. West was paired in this film with Edward Burns who was terrific and Ving Rhames who was Ving Rhames. I say that, because sometimes he's the perfect fit for a role and other times, he couldn't be more out of place, a perfect example of which is his role in this film. As I said, this movie starts out great, but becomes exactly like Eagle Eye, I would venture to say that the two films are so much a like that the producers of Eagle Eye have a case for copyright infringement, it really was that close. Besides that, the film was a decent action film, with some nice performances. Had I not seen Eagle Eye, I may have thought more of this film, but as it stands, Echelon Conspiracy is just another low budget rip off of a semi-decent major motion picture and not much else.",1369958400,,1841,4.385964912280702

However, something else is up with this phone, and the guy who receives it finds himself tangled up with the FBI and other bad guys.

I won't spoil the plot for you, but I will say this movie is worthy of seeing once. Once you have seen it, I doubt you will have any urge to watch it again without it being some stupid personal reason. It's worthy of renting once... however, at the moment Amazon is selling it for under $4...

3858175,2,B00274SIUG,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW***

The film starts out as an excellent thriller/mystery in spite of the lead being Shane West. Shane stars as Max ""glass jaw"" Peterson a man who installs programs in computers to prevent hackers. Max gets a strange phone that sends him text messages which saves his life and gives him money. We also know the government is after this device and other people have received such a phone and have died from following its instructions. At this point the film is an excellent thriller/mystery.

There are few suspects and clues in this production and then we find out who's the culprit and the film becomes boring. Max saves the day from a stunt he saw in ""War Games"" or if you prefer, the Star Trek episode ""The Changeling."" At this point I groaned. Perhaps if you have never seen either of those two productions, this might seem pretty darn good. As for me, I got bored when I realized you could kill the ""bad guy"" by tripping over the plug.

Ving Rhames always does a good character job. Outside of that, the film lacked. Might work as a rental. Better than most of the ""Red Box"" action.

3858177,4,B00274SIUG,"As other reviewers have said, yes, it's similar to Eagle Eye, but the acting and story line is far superior (I can't stand Shia Lebeouf).  Yes, this story has been done before about government conspiracies and trying to break into the government and so on, but what makes this movie watchable is that the screenplay was very well written - it's not choppy, no nonsense filler scenes, there's action and progression, and makes you believe something like this could actually happen by drawing you into the story.  So you have a great script, great actors, and you have a movie you'll wanna watch on a Saturday night in.",1324512000,,617,4.703703703703703
3858178,3,B00274SIUG,"""Echelon Conspiracy"" is a fairly good thriller.  Director Greg Marcks who won an academy award as a student keeps the pace brisk and the mystery unfolding.  Of the actors, Tamara Feldman comes across the best IMHO.  She plays Kamila.  From the first moments where she bumps into Max in a hotel hallway, we know she is not all she appears to be.  Feldman, who has done lots of recent TV from ""Gossip Girls,"" ""Royal Pains"" & ""One Tree Hill,"" gives the character depth.  Her reaction frames as she slouches wounded against the bathroom wall are powerful.  Shane West, who I have been enjoying on the series ""Nikita,"" plays the lead Max Peterson.  He allows the story to be more interesting than his character's reaction to events.  The flat performance doesn't give much of a springboard on which the film can rebound.  Edward Burns who I actually did see in ""27 Dresses"" plays John Reed, the casino security and ex-agent.  Martin Sheen's Raymond Burke is the bad guy bureaucrat who raves and twitches in Washington DC.  Ving Rhames doesn't have as much to do as he did in ""Mission Impossible II,"" but adequately goes through the paces.  Jonathan Pryce who has been in numerous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films plays his usual ruthless tycoon.  Sergey Gubanov plays the computer whizz Yuri Melanin in what is a great role for the young actor, allowing him to show several different layers.

This is very noisy movie with lots of heavy background sounds and whatnot luckily you can hear the dialog through the sound. There is lots of action and it is actually quite fun to watch. There is no real depth to this story yet the twists and turns are fun to watch. There is the obligatory sex scene, which seems out of place and is not that racy. Much of the dialogue and scenarios are lifted from previous films. One that comes to mind is the end of ""War Games"" were the computer has to play tic-tac-toe with itself to realize that there is no acceptable move but not to play. This could also bring to mind the Star Trek episode where the computer realizes that he is destroying the very people he is supposed to protect.

[MILD SPOILER INCLUDED in this paragraph] I believe the similarity is accidental, but ""The Echelon Conspiracy"" made me feel like watching ""Eagle Eye"" again. And perhaps ""War Game,"" too. The difference is that D.J. Caruso, director of the surprise hit starring Shia LaBeouf, knew how to handle the action scenes more competently. There are a car chase and a shoot-out in ""Echelon Conspiracy,"" but the badly edited stunts lack thrills and, with all respect to those who got involved, sometimes even look amateurish.

Maybe director Greg Marcks (""11:14"") is not ready for action films of this scale.

The movie actually reminded me quite a bit of an X-Files episode several years ago, Kill Switch, in which a government-controlled satellite was tracking people, and ultimately killed them with a laser.

There are some small roles by Ving Rhames, Jonathan Pryce, & Martin Sheen. And though it's not exactly edge-of-your-seat, there are a couple neat car chases, and the soundtrack & music editing is actually pretty decent.

3858196,3,B00274SIUG,"Anyone who regularly watches recent films will immediately see ""Echelon Conspiracy"" as more than a bit similar to the thriller, ""Eagle Eye"" (which had been released 6 months earlier), as both films involve conspiracies involving the government, with innocents forced to participate in the plot via mysterious messages over cellphones. But if your viewing habits encompass a wider range of films, you will also find ""Echelon Conspiracy"" owes as much to ""Enemy of the State"", ""Wargames"", and a number of other suspense films...and the derivative nature of the plot unfortunately defeats a decent cast, and beautiful location work around the world.

While Shane West, with his blue-collar persona, seems an unlikely casting choice as a brilliant engineer, he hasn't suffered from the over-exposure of Shia LaBeouf, and his performance grows on you, as the film progresses. Edward Burns (as an ex-FBI agent/casino security chief) and Ving Rhames (as his FBI ex-partner), both deserve better roles in better films, but do provide solid support for West (although why the FBI would violate it's mandate, and operate actively in Europe, is one of many plotholes in the script). Sexy Tamara Feldman is the obligatory love interest with a secret agenda, and Jonathan Pryce, in a tiny cameo, has fun as Burns' ruthless boss. Then there is villainous Martin Sheen...well, if this film is any indication, he gave up serious acting when ""The West Wing"" went off the air!

If you are an armchair traveller, you will enjoy the film; Bangkok is gloriously colorful, Prague, rich in 'Old World' charm, and Moscow figures prominently in a high-voltage night car chase. You may wonder about the mountains in the 'Nebraska' finale, but you do get your money's worth in exotic locales.

Ultimately, ""Echelon Conspiracy"" isn't terrible, and if you are a casual movie watcher, you may enjoy the film. But if you find yourself experiencing dj vu, don't worry; you HAVE seen all this before!",1258156800,,1966,5.118380062305296
3858197,4,B00274SIUG,"An unwitting security programmer gets involved in a plot run out of NSA headquarters and is found running half way around the world following instructions from a cell phone he receives anonymously.

We visit Thailand, The Czech Republic and Moscow, Russia as Max Petersen, gets messages that save his life and give him clues to make some big bucks.  Where are his instructions coming from and why?  We see suddenly, he is in a casino, and security gets involved.  One of those on Security is former FBI.  His former partner suddenly gets involved as he is constant contact with NSA head played by Martin Sheen.  There is a pic of George Bush on the wall, so this is reflecting a time of Bush's presidency.  (hence the comments on others regarding Bush Bashing).

You really do not know during the movie if Sheen is involved in what Eschelon is doing or not.  This is a somewhat plausible plot, but takes some of the technology regarding facial recognition and others and stretches them a little.  You come to realize this may be a whole lot bigger than everyone involved thinks.  So, who or what has control of the worlds most powerful surveillance system?

Frankly, it makes a good story.  I would rather not have any hints about Bush and they could have had a made up President.  Other than that, a good rental, or even a buy at a good price.  The acting was fine, Shane West, Ed Burns (The Holiday) and Ving Rhames do great jobs.",1256083200,2,1432,4.56078431372549

The story centers around a young man installing a security system on servers. When he receives a phone from DHL he assumes at first it is some type promo since it suggests things for him to do. At first they seem harmless to help him relax. When he becomes three million dollars richer from it's advice he realizes something far more ominous is involved. Afterall people have died and if he doesn't do what it says, he may as well. Good directing, acting, camera work, sets, sound, and music by mostly Russians filmed in Eastern Europe and Russia. I think it deserves three and a half stars. Good quality DVD with no extras. Decent replayability.

3858199,1,B00274SIUG,"The weakest link in this chain (though there are few strong ones) is Shane West, the ""star."" This nobody (apparently a veteran of several TV series...which is hardly cause to celebrate) couldn't act his way out of a smoke ring. He's totally unbelievable, at practically every moment broadcasting: ""Look at me! I'm adorable! And I'm acting!"" The supporting cast could have gotten together with him to give him some acting lessons, but they're too busy slogging through this mess themselves to concern themselves with ""supporting."" This movie is a mess!",1253318400,,551,5.133333333333334

3858201,4,B00274SIUG,"War Games meets Die Hard with Ving Rhames, Edward Burns, and Shane West driving the bus. The action was fast and furious with hints about the underlying story. Finally a female character who isn't wearing heels and letting the men do the fighting -- Tamara Feldman kicked butt. It was fast-paced but with enough story to keep the tension high.  Highly recommended for those of us who are action junkies who want a plot.",1251158400,,419,4.662162162162162
3858202,1,B00274SIUG,"That's right, I paid the price and watched it so you don't have to!

This is easily the worst movie of the year whatever the year is. I actually rate -5. I mean it has significant negative redeeming value. But there is no getting back my time or IQ points I lost.

It is nothing but a set of beaten to death cliches. Add to this horrible acting, plot that will insult your intelligence (if you have any), and there you have it.

If your life depended on watching this movie - choose death.",1250121600,3,489,4.180851063829787

8353949,4,B00274SIUG,"This movie was thrilling from the start. The action prompted heavy anticipation and suspense to formulate throughout the film. The original concept was built upon to form one giant conspiracy of which Shane West served as a suitable center. Although somewhat predictable, I was intrigued by the originality of the concept of the film. It would have been legendary if the execution was slightly altered in terms of storyline timing. The supporting cast also did not help the story- I did not form deep bonds with any of them and felt that they were lacking. However, I did enjoy watching this mystery unfold and would say it is definitely worth the watch.",1468800000,,654,4.848214285714286
