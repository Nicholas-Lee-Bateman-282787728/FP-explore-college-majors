8055016,4,B00080MF6E,"This Cartoon Craze collection starts with 5 episodes of the Bosko series, directed by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising, all with terrific music by Frank Marsales.
They are in b&w and show their age, but are very clever, and one episode (""Big Man from the North""), shows some ""pre-code"" violence that perhaps would not have passed the censors when Hollywood film codes were enforced in 1934. The final 3 episodes are from the Famous Studios, in brilliant Technicolor, and with music by Winston Sharples. Cartoons of the 30's and 40's had moments and characters that would be considered politically incorrect now, and if not viewed in the context of the era might be offensive to some. Total running time is 61 minutes.
The episodes are:

1: ""Bosko Shipwrecked,"" 1931. Animation: Rollin Hamilton and Larry Martin. This is shown in sepia tones.
Bosko's ship is caught in a fierce storm, and he washes up on the shore of an island, populated by cannibals and fierce animals.
2: ""Ain't Nature Grand,"" 1931. Animation: Isadore ""Friz"" Freleng and Norm Blackburn.
Bosko enjoys a day in the country, except when the bees attack!
3: ""Big Man from the North,"" 1931. Animation: Isadore ""Friz"" Freleng and Robert Edmunds.
Bosko is a lawman going after a wanted criminal, and Honey sings some great tunes (""Chinnin' and Chattin' with May"" and ""Lookin' for the Love Light in the Dark""). Some releases of this cartoon edit the stabbing of the criminal, but here you have the uncut version.
4: Battling Bosko,"" 1932. Animation: Isadore ""Friz"" Freleng and Paul Smith.
Bosko challenges the Champ while Graham Cracker calls the fight, and Honey plays some nifty honky-tonk tunes on the piano.
5: ""Bosko and Honey,"" 1932. Animation: Rollin Hamilton and Bob McKinson.
Bosko, Honey and Bruno the dog go for a picnic, and get caught in the rain. This one was never released theatrically.

6: ""Mr. Rossi on the Beach,"" 1964. Animation: Guido Manuli and Franco Martelli.
Created by award winning Italian cartoonist Bruno Bozzetto, this is an interesting piece in this collection; it has a very European look, with stark lines, bright colors, and would have been considered ""modern"" in the '60s.
7: ""Sudden Fried Chicken,"" 1946. Directed by Bill Tytla, animation by Orestes Calpini and Otto Feuer.
Features Herman the mouse and Henry the rooster. Henry is being henpecked, so Herman suggests that he become a wrestler, and lures him with thoughts of money, wine, women and song.
8: ""Stupidstitious Cat,"" 1947. Directed by Seymour Knietel, animated by Graham Place and John Walworth.
This one is laugh out loud funny, with Buzzy the crow in his animated debut, keeping himself from being eaten by tricking the cat with superstitions. By far my favorite of the collection, the cat and Buzzy are supposed to be a parody of Jack Benny and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson.
9: ""Hep Cat Symphony,"" 1949. Directed by Seymour Knietel, animated by Dave Tendlar and Martin Taras.
Hep Cat's cool jazz and scat singing vs. the Mouse Symphony and their long hair music, ending up with Rossini's ""William Tell Overture.""",1120348800,9,3069,4.968871595330739
