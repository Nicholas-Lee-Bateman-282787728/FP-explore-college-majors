Like any show, it will take a while for the characters to grow on you. In fact, I saw the premier and was not impressed. Then, over a couple of years, I saw another show or two before I finally appreciated how unique and creative Community is. It is most impressive how much they can work into 22 minutes of airtime. Often, it feels like a full movie and the production value is just as impressive. The lack of a laugh track also takes some getting used to, but once you do you'll feel other shows with laugh tracks are insulting your intelligence. And intelligent is what the writing on Community is -- and silly -- often at the same time, and I love that too. Another unique aspect of the show is that the characters are mulch-dimensional. For example, Jeff Winger may be a good looking playboy but his flaws are often on display and he is often humbled & humiliated. Another measure of any great show is how unforgetable it is, and whether Community is putting you in the middle of an epic paint-ball or pillow-fort vs blanket-fort war or a simple search for a missing pen, it becomes a memorable experience you'll wish you could have been a part of in real life. And usually, they tie things together in the end in a touching lesson-learning way that opens you up to a better understanding of people and relationships. I'm a big fan!",1404259200,,1457,4.4
