8606771,5,B00EM2OVN4,"Lucas is a real pleasure to watch and listen to. He is dynamic, confident, very experienced, and really cares about imparting good negotiating habits to his audience--which, in my case, is my Negotiation class. The students love him. He's funny; he's sharp as a tack; and he gives so much practical advice. This is a DVD so full of helpful tips that you will watch it over and over again. By a long shot the best ""How To"" DVD I've seen about fine art of negotiation.",1429142400,,466,4.430232558139535
