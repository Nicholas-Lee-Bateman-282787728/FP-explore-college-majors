8596359,5,B00DQK7HJ8,"Beautiful cinematography as noted by others.  There were a few spots where the CGI was so bad it made you wince, but most of it was well done.  Good choreography on the initial fight scenes.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters.  Well worth watching after waiting for a long time to find a reasonably priced version.",1455408000,,330,4.637931034482759
