4641647,4,B005AU4QG4,We just loved these Christmas classics! They never get old or tired. It is wonderful to share these with the grandchildren.,1356998400,,123,4.904761904761905
4641648,5,B005AU4QG4,This DVD set has some fantastic stories.  Jack Frost and The Year WIthout a Santa Claus are some of my favorite Holiday claymations.  Brings me back to when I was a kid!,1325116800,2,169,4.25
4641649,3,B005AU4QG4,"Two years after the color-corrected, remastered ""Grinch"" was released on DVD, this collection still employs the old, dull, yellowish Grinch version. Come on!",1324944000,14,157,5.869565217391305
4641650,2,B005AU4QG4,"I find it very hard to believe that Warner Brothers does not know what most people  REALLY want!! - ALL the Rankin/Bass specials W/B owns together in one nice neat box set!! Instead they trickle them out here and there, box set after box set, just slightly altering the titles and wasting space with non-Rankin/Bass specials that simply stink! Why would you release a set where 85% of the contents are made by one company, meanwhile you own the rights to unreleased specials by that same company, but instead tack on tacky new ones that 99% of the buyers have no interest in! Silly. Stupid. Dumb. Rude.",1322438400,35,602,4.626168224299065
4641651,4,B005AU4QG4,"This 3-disc set includes:

1. Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! - Every who down in Who-ville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch who lived just north of Who-ville did NOT! So the cuddly as a cactus Grinch (with termites in his smile and garlic in his soul) tries to wipe out Christmas for the cheerful Who-villains.
2. The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold - A leprechaun named Blarney Kilakilarney loses his gold to a banshee on Christmas Eve.
3. Pinocchio's Christmas - It's Pinocchio's first Christmas and he realizes the holiday is not about gifts but about being together with family.
4. The Year Without a Santa Claus Deluxe Edition - When Santa decides to retire one Christmas, Mrs. Claus takes action.
5. Rudolph's Shiny New Year - Baby New Year is missing and a certain red-nosed reindeer leads the search.
6. Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey - Back in the days of the Roman Empire, a small donkey named Nestor who is teased mercilessly about his abnormally long ears, becomes a hero when he is chosen by Mary and Joseph to take them to Bethlehem where Mary gives birth to baby Jesus.
7. Jack Frost (1976) - The resourceful cold-weather elf turns human to court a pretty maiden - and then must recover his icy powers to save her from a crafty rival.
8. A Miser Brothers Christmas - Santa Claus and the mischievous brothers Heat Miser and Snow Miser are the targets of yuletide treachery from that sneaky blowhard North Wind.
Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July - The feature length delight about what happens when a certain reindeer's nose stops shining!

It's fun seeing favorite characters in new specials!  We also got to meet some new characters (well, new to us).  I do wish there had been more to this collection, like adding the Frosty the Snowman cartoons and the regular Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but if you already have those then this is a nice addition to your holiday favorites.  :)",1320796800,40,1925,4.717261904761905
4641652,2,B005AU4QG4,"All I have to say another year comes and another year of disappointment from Warner Bros. They just don't get it, instead of releasing this box set with the never before remastered releases of Rankin Bass's "" The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus "" and "" The First Christmas "" also "" Little Drummer Boy Book II "" we get this new set with the not so classic "" Miser Bros Christmas "" included which could hardly capture any of the magic of the original Miser Bros in "" The Year without a Santa Claus "" Rankin Bass classic.

I would recommend to get the proper previous set if you really do not have these shows yet, as it was a much better box set, though they did make a blunder and insert the wrong disc for The Year without a Santa Claus in many sets with the the live action movie so you never know if you'll get the right disc. Just goes to show you how much care they take with these great shows to insert the wrong disc. Stay clear of this 2011 Christmas box set and send Warner Bros a message you want all ORIGINAL Rankin Bass classics! They ditched the Rankin Bass animated original  "" The Stingiest Man in Town "" in this box set which was a take on the Christmas Carol. The only thing good they did here was include the Rankin Bass classic "" Jack Frost"" but still every year Rankin Bass fans hope for something like The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus and that would have been a much better fit since Jack Frost is already out in a stand alone deluxe edition.

Here's what you get in this box set if you are curious.

Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas
The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold
Pinocchio's Christmas
The Year Without A Santa Claus
Rudolph's Shiny New Year
Nestor The Long-Eared Christmas Donkey
Jack Frost
A Miser Brothers Christmas
Rudolph And Frosty's Christmas In July

It's could be so much better! If only Warner Bros would release all the Rankin Bass specials they own in one box set with a whole disc of Rankin Bass related extras I am sure they would sell a lot more of these. I give the Original Rankin Bass shows here and The Grinch 5 stars but this release I give 2 out of 5 stars because it's just the same old, same old!",1312416000,32,2159,4.2560975609756095

4641689,3,B005AU4QG4,"Love the old claymations and classic stories, docked one star because there is no episode list anywhere. The discs have pictures of the main characters, but not all of them. There is no pamphlet to tell you which stories are on what discs nor does the back or inside of the DVD case say. Once to watch them you'll most likely remember, or you may forget by next year. Either way it was a little of a let down. I docked a second star because I had hoped to have more of the original classics on here. The dvd cover i feel is intentonally misleading. Other reviewers have posted which movies are on the discs, wish I had read the reviews before I bought. Most of the stories on these discs are spin offs of some of the originals we know very well. Example: Rudolph's original story is not on these DVDs, but the spinner Rudolph's New Year is on here. I will definitely make sure to get the one I want next time, its just irritating that I will have to read the reviews to get a full view of what's on the DVDs.",1451606400,2,1008,4.174358974358975

It's most of the Rankin & Bass movies, plus the Frosty cartoons, plus the original cartoon Grinch. I won't bother listing the individual movies as it has previously been done, but for the price of two Big Mac combos at Mickey D's - what not buy this DVD set instead?

The ONLY movie from that list that is included in this Christmas dvd set is the Grinch. I have never heard of nor seen any of the other random claymation videos included in this dvd. My kids don't seem to mind so much which is the only reason I have not scored this lower.
