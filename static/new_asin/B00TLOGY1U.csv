7012910,5,B00TLOGY1U,"Just watched this on ACORN streaming. What a wonderful film. Imelda Staunton (Mrs. Carson, i.e., wife of actor Jim Carter) is just lovely as is her co-star Michael Ball. Two people who were in the same children's chorus in Manchester, England in 1929 meet in 1969 -- enough said. Please, please watch this lovely film! Only the Brits do this sort of thing -- and they do it SO WELL!!!",1453420800,5,384,4.5

8702208,5,B00TLOGY1U,"Victoris Wood is a great comedian and has given us a musical gem that flashes back between 1969 and 1929. Love Imelda Staunton, so this was very good fun.",1496188800,,154,4.344827586206897

8702214,5,B00TLOGY1U,"Yes, it's a silly affair, but it is also extremely entertaining.  Well worth watching and a welcome break from most of the dark brooding programs we see or humor films and try-too-hard TV series that are often disappointing.",1479168000,,224,4.894736842105263
8702215,4,B00TLOGY1U,"An unusual musical in which two children who sang in the Manchester Childrens' Choir are reunited, in middle age, at a documentary about the choir. Interesting method of showing the paths their lives took and of bringing them together at the end. Nice staging, good voices, warm story. A pleasant way to spend a cool, dreary, rainy afternoon.",1478995200,,342,4.913793103448276
