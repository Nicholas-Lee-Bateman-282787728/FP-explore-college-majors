8200624,5,B000RGSX3S,"the dvd was great. BUT the fiasco of learning ten days after I ordered a 2 day turnaround that my debit didn't go through, thus making my gift to my wife truly late was no fun at all in all accounts.  I appreciated the final conversations with customer service and how it eventually worked out but very frustrated with the process.  I am a long time purchaser, not a lot of quantity but regular and up until these last two orders it's be a dream working with you folks.  the last two have been a night mare.  did you change something?",1418342400,,534,4.257425742574258
8200625,5,B000RGSX3S,"This is a beautiful documentary on the art of shibori in Arimatsu, Japan. Lots of video of specific artists creating shibori textiles. Mesmerizing and inspiring!",1366156800,,161,5.48
8200626,5,B000RGSX3S,I have been very surprised about this video. It is so detailed and inspired by the japonese sense of perfection. You can see these old women praticing this art with so much care like if you were in the same room. I also appreciated the presentation of the new machines permitting to do the same work in a faster way but not with the same energy ... Each presentation is a little bit long but you can easily select the chapter you want.,1284249600,2,435,4.253012048192771
8200627,2,B000RGSX3S,"While I enjoyed watching this video -- I was disappointed at the lack of instruction.  From a historical perspective, it was interesting -- but for those that are trying to learn about the shibori process and implement the designs, I would not recommend this, rather pricey, DVD.",1260576000,3,279,4.9361702127659575
8200628,5,B000RGSX3S,"After reading several of Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada's books on shibori, I really wanted to see how it was made in realtime, not just as a series of printed images. This DVD does the trick, and it's even narrated by the venerable Wada san. Seeing each step of the process from design through to production and display of the final product brings home the understanding of how complex and time consuming the creation of shibori textiles can be.",1232496000,8,436,4.675324675324675
8200629,3,B000RGSX3S,"What I could see of the video was wonderful.
Amazing skills in the hands of the Japanese masters that might soon be lost.
Sadly, the disc locked up about an hour and half into in.  From one of my
fiber lists, I learned that all the discs in the present batch had this
issue. Amazon refunded my money.",1202428800,2,300,4.172413793103448
8200630,2,B000RGSX3S,"pardon typing. simply put great documentry on shibori . but i really wanted to learn., not be inspired. but it is magnificent as inspirstion.  after all instructional videos should be 60 bucks.not a mere 30.",1201219200,4,207,4.914285714285715
8200631,3,B000RGSX3S,"This was a very informative DVD with excellent close up views of skilled artisans demonstrating many different techniques. However, my copy of the DVD was defective and i could not play whole sections. I need to find out how to obtain a replacement....
Update: Amazon sent a replacement very quickly - most impressive-and this one seems to be working fine for searching the menu. I would strongly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in trying the various shibori techniques themselves.  It complements the written descriptions in the excellent books ""Shibori- the inventive art of Japanese shaped resist dyeing"" by Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada- the woman who narrates the English version of the DVD- and others and ""Memory on cloth Shibori now"" also by Wada.",1198108800,15,755,5.138211382113822
8200632,5,B000RGSX3S,"I just got my copy of this new DVD. It is just wonderful! It is so much easier to understand the shibori techniques now that I can see them. The DVD is as beautiful, graceful and elegant as the techniques themselves. The text is clear and concise without being repetitious. Yoshiko's voice is delicate and reserved in the most lady like Japanese manner and yet well articulated and confident. Andrew Galli, Producer of Studio Galli Production, Editor Eric Bailey, Associate producer and English version expert Yoshiko Wada and her collaborator Hiroshi Murase in Arimatsu have done something just wonderful for the preservation of these crafts and to honor the artisans who still perform them. The scope of this living legacy is very inclusive with both the history of Shibori, and pracatical application of the techniques as they are used today. I was pleased to see that some of these women (and men) are not 85 years old! I am hopeful for the continuation of this great craft tradition. The DVD will be a great aid to all of us who practice or teach shibori, and it should be of interest to historians and collectors of Japanese textiles as well.  I know I will watch it over and over.",1198108800,20,1187,4.706730769230769
