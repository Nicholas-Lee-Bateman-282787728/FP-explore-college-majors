8721347,5,B0102NEWUS,"Just watched it Chinese version only to catch up on my Cantonese. It is one of the funniest Chinese comedy I have ever seen. It is about a small roast duck restaurant owner's struggle with a westernized fried Chicken fast food restaurant across the street. It is some what slap stick, but it is pretty funny. I think if you know the original language and the Chinese culture you may find it even funnier. Being a potential business partner, watching this gave me a sense of desiring the right tract that it is good to be humble, and treat your employees well. Not to mention it is okay to be original. I hope to the price would go down a bit, and maybe I would buy this and share it with my friends here in the States.",1465084800,2,718,4.248175182481752
