2778227,4,B000NQR8K6,"Mushi are the oldest lifeforms in existence, even below microorganisms and fungi. They evolved so long ago that most humans cannot even see them in their true form. Most of the time they appear as floating, almost plankton-like organisms drifting through the air and effortlessly passing through anything material in their way. Some can even take human form. Mushi are neither good nor evil. They simply are. But on occasion the very presence of mushi can lead to problems for humans. For example in one of these episodes, a girl becomes extremely sensitive to sunlight and has to stay in the dark all the time with a cloth over her eyes because mushi have taken up residence there. When mushi are involved, using the standard problem solving procedures such as doctors and such meets with very little success. No, someone with special abilities has to be called in. Enter the unassuming and serenely calm Ginko, a travelling Mushishi who tries to end any negative consequences caused by the interaction between humans and mushi.  A lot of the victims of the mushi tend to be young such as a girl following a moving swamp which is actually a collective mushi. Or a boy whose drawings come to life and another who has grown extremely sensitive to noise and has grown horns!

The problem that keeps Mushishi from being a great show is its single-minded devotion to the mushi. Because of its monster of the....I mean mushi of the week, the show can get a bit repetitive. Kinda like Inuyasha's over reliance on Naraku as the main antagonist which can suck the life out of original ideas. I mean the writers had to somehow turn every episode of Mushishi into a hunt for mushi. I will admit that the writers did a good job making us sympathize with all of the supporting characters. If you don't care for the people Ginko is helping out, you must be really emotionally remote. I haven't read the manga but the director of the anime, Hiroshi Nagahama took very careful steps to keep the anime version as close to the manga as possible and was a big fan of the series before he got involved with the anime version. Really, the show reminded me a bit of Sergio Leone westerns in which a lone gunfighter comes to town and straightens out the world temporarily.  I look forward to finding out more about this mushishi in the next couple of volumes.",1191888000,4,2337,4.640096618357488
2778228,5,B000NQR8K6,"I just recently saw this anime.  It is very different from anything else I've seen.  The art is amazing. The landscapes are mostly wild with only an occasional human presence. Each story works as a little jewel all on its own with only the character Ginko tying them together.  As a mushi master he has answers for people with unique problems.  In spite of that he often runs across things that surprise and confound him.  He's still learning, although, from episode 2, it is clear that he has paid a price for his knowledge.  It doesn't hurt that the English dub for the character is done by Travis Willingham one of my favorite anime voices.  Buy it, borrow it, but do watch it.  You won't look at the natural world the same way.  And when the sky darkens and the snow falls thickly, and sound begins to fade away - you will wonder what might have made a home in your attic.",1191456000,2,876,4.3580246913580245
2778229,5,B000NQR8K6,"I've seen the entire series and I have to say this is one of the most beautifully written and soulful series out there (anime or non).  Please note, this is NOT an action-packed anime although there is action from time-to-time. This isn't particularly a tear-jerker either, but there are stories of profound sadness.  What it is, is a drama that lets itself take itself to develop the story.

The plot over the series is that Ginko - a Mushi-Shi (kinda' like a shaman or doctor specializing in supernatural ailments) travels Japan to investigate and solve people's problems.  Each episode is an independent (but loosely continuous and connected) short story.  Endings are often surprising and thoughtful.

Volume 1 covers the first 5 episodes.
EPISODE 1 - About an isolated boy whose writings and pictures come to life, but is haunted by a quiet ghost.

EPISODE 2 - About a girl with mushi-infected eyes locked away in total darkness and her cousin who comes to visit and play with her.

EPISODE 3 - An isolated snowfallen village is infected by mushi which eats up all noise.  One child is infected so badly, he mysteriously grows horns like his mother.

EPISODE 4 - A man's dreams are infected by Mushi which gives him dreams of disasters to come (and avoid), but the dreams aren't the prophecies he thinks they are.

EPISODE 5 - Ginko finds a travelling swamp which disappears and reappears and a special woman looking to belong who becomes the swamp's companion.",1187222400,17,1466,4.800796812749004

2778301,5,B000NQR8K6,One of my favorite shows. HIGHLY recommend to anyone who loves a good writing,1458691200,,77,4.571428571428571
2778302,4,B000NQR8K6,"weird, but good. Wish it had more of a story through out.",1457827200,,57,3.8333333333333335
2778303,5,B000NQR8K6,"Dude, this is an awesome series if you like Mystery/Fantasy. Totally worth the watch, even season 2 is great!",1456876800,,109,4.7894736842105265
2778304,3,B000NQR8K6,"As other reviewers point out, the show is gorgeous with incredible visuals, immersive environments, and compelling story arcs...

One super frustration, though... It seems to be dubbed/no-subbed. Different viewers invariably have their own styles, I just happen to be a huge original voice-actors/subtitles anime fan. Funimation is usually pretty good about providing both options, or at the very least warning you if a title is one or the other... A little frustrated that this one is dubbed only... :(",1440201600,,503,5.367088607594937
2778305,5,B000NQR8K6,One of the most amazing anime series I have ever watched. Each episode is so beautifully poetic! I highly recommend this.,1432339200,,121,4.809523809523809
2778306,5,B000NQR8K6,I have viewed this series once before. I love it!,1427068800,,49,4.0
2778307,1,B000NQR8K6,"The one-star isn't really for the series; I only watched the first episode, which I rather liked. The single star is for Amazon's dishonesty in promoting the first episode as ""Free"" when they actually monetize it by interrupting it with ads. I think about 12 ads in all, in three blocks. Dear Amazon: free, to me, means you don't rob minutes of my life to force me to watch 12 ads for Mr. Clean's Magic Eraser.

Yes, that's right, all 12 ads were the same ad! I can only assume that this is a test run for Amazon's effort to recast their streaming service in the image of the cable TV model that everybody loves, where we pay for the privilege of having our time wasted by ads. Evidently they haven't yet gotten anybody but Proctor and Gamble to buy ad blocks. Early days, early days.

One thing I want to know is, who at Procter and Gamble thought that repeating the same ad 12 times would be a great way to promote the brand?

I was interested enough in the series that I would have paid $1.99 to try the first episode, but now I'm not so sure I want Amazon to think I am okay with them shifting to an ad-monetization model.",1422748800,,1126,4.252336448598131
2778308,5,B000NQR8K6,"My 10/10 mangaupdates review for the identical manga: I find Mushishi NOT to be boring but i view it as the MOST boring anime (but not sure if manga) ever and the sheer commitment to no service of any kind to the reader/viewer has to be admired as there is only deep storytelling, the beauty of nature and nothing more. The mangaka clearly had a vision to tell and didn't care about the reader one bit so ether you get on the slowest train if all or you go home. I recently ""forced"" a friend of mine to watch the whole anime series and he described it as gently walking through a forest. I couldn't describe it better and this is the best Mono no aware of all. The new [m]Mushishi Tokubetsu Hen - Hihamu Kage[/m] from 2014 is identical to the two sisters episode 11/12 (or special if you like) from season 2 btw. I am interested in more such shorts and [Yokohama Shopping Trip] (8,5/10) is another must in the sub-genre.",1416096000,,920,4.323699421965318
2778309,5,B000NQR8K6,I love this animation. It is quietly soothing in drawing and sound. Clever and exciting. I love the sound the footsteps make in snow. Why is this no longer on Netflix? Such a pity.,1408233600,,180,4.323529411764706
2778323,5,B000NQR8K6,"The animation is clean and depicts these Asian Urban Ghost folktales in a compelling and attractive manner.  The English dubbing is clear and easy on the ear [no characteristic squealing or hoarse shouting].
The stories are the focus - as they should be.  I am an Anime fan but usually view a series once.  Exceptions are anything by Masamune Shirow, Sword Art Online and now This series.
I find it very pleasant to to pick any one at random and enjoy it -- the stories are only minimally serial.  I highly recommend this series.",1396396800,2,529,4.595744680851064
2778324,5,B000NQR8K6,I wish this show was still being produced.  The ideas and creativity are amazing.  These stories tell so much about the culture that created them.  It's like hearing the spooky and mysterious stories of any culture.  Some elements are the same and others are very different.  I love this show!,1395964800,,293,4.78
2778325,5,B000NQR8K6,"I love that movie. I watched it many times. Very nice drawings, interesting stories, amazing pictures. I recommended to anybody.",1386979200,,128,5.45
2778326,5,B000NQR8K6,If you like original animes then  this is one of them you should get. They is a story in each episode that you would love!,1363910400,,122,3.88
2778327,5,B000NQR8K6,"Mushi are living organisms in their purest form. Ginko is a Mushishi, a man that studies the Mushi. Not everyone can see Mushi. Those that can are either scared of them or fascinated by them. Ginko travels the country helping people who have encounters with the different varieties of Mushi.

Each episode of this series is a different story. Ginko's travels lead him to many people that need his help. I am blown away by this anime. The animation, music, and plot are all superbly done. I can't say enough good things about Mushishi. I hope you check it out. It's great that Funimation put this title in the SAVE edition. I think that's the cheapest way to buy the complete series, so I would go that route instead. It's a steal for the money.",1354752000,,744,4.511111111111111
2778328,5,B000NQR8K6,I've been dying to get some good anime for a while now and this really hit the spot. It's so beautiful and almost hippy-esque. I love it!,1309564800,,137,4.111111111111111
2778329,5,B000NQR8K6,"this is one of my favourite, if not my very favourite, anime of all time. it's really beautifully done, in concept, animation, and individual stories. i like also that one can watch the series in any order, and still not be lost. it's worth watching again and again.",1299715200,,266,4.5625
2778330,5,B000NQR8K6,"Beautiful and engaging, this series follows a man whose work is to help people affected by ""mushi"" - creatures partly alive and partly inanimate - and generally inhabiting a world just beyond our reach... except when that world touches ours.

The world is painted in brilliant, living colour, populated with deep and varied characters and a fascinating mythology full of strange creatures - all backed by a haunting and magical score.

Exceptional watching!",1210982400,3,457,5.2465753424657535
2778331,5,B000NQR8K6,"i can't add whats already been said other than this is alot like watching a miazaki film in its pace and depth. buy the first volume, and you'll be buying the rest, i guarantee.",1197936000,,177,4.235294117647059
2778332,5,B000NQR8K6,"Mushi-shi is not your action-type anime; no giant robots or sword-wielding ninja or vampires. But I find myself returning to Mushi-shi more than I do the other anime series I own. So many series get placed on the shelf and not visited again except for one or two key episodes once I've watched it through to the end and know how everything turns out. But I return to each episode of Mushi-shi again and again, and find something new to appreciate in it each time. I'm not waiting anxiously for the next volume so I find out who lives/dies or how my favorite character fares: I'm anxiously waiting because this is a series that I enjoy every moment of every episode and enjoy it just as much the fifth time I view it as the first.",1192492800,,729,4.367647058823529
8180890,5,B000NQR8K6,"Refreshing change of pace from your standard giant alien robot zombie demon fighting super powered high school kids (not that I don't enjoy that too).  The primary story arc is nicely woven into a series of individual tales following Ginko (and more specifically, the Mushi).  To me, this whole series has a bitter-sweet 'fairy tale' like quality to it, sort of in the tradition of Miyazaki (the story, not the art, though the music is quite good as well).  I would rank this up there with the likes of CLAMPs xxxholic (if you have not seen it and enjoyed this series, you might enjoy that one too... don't let the name scare you... it is about a 'time witch' and 'magic & consequences'... though; that show has a much lighter mood and involves high school kids...so...).  Also refreshing is that Mushi-Shi isn't a drama filled with chibi kawaii transitions (unlike xxxholic)... it sticks to a more realistic tone and reserves the typical (and often fun, yes) standard anime tropes (like I said, it is refreshing).  Sort of like Grave of the Fireflies (only nowhere near as depressing) or perhaps Wings of the Honneamise.  Any who... that is how I see this series and I'm glad I watched it a second time through.",1510704000,,1212,4.693396226415095

8180892,5,B000NQR8K6,"You can read other reviews about what makes this so great, the greatest animation series of all time and maybe one of the great TV shows of all time, period. I had heard that it was not suitable for children, but most of the episodes I saw had no violence, and absolutely no sexual content. But as I kept watching and saw some traumatic content. I saw a couple of episodes where characters, including children, die, and also depictions of their grieving spouses. Perhaps this is more true of Mushi-shi Next Passage, the follow up series (Amazon does not call it season 2, which is a little confusing). It's a very different approach than what you would find in your average animated series.",1490832000,,690,4.617886178861789
