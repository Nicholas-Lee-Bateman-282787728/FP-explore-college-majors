6761200,5,B00OU4MTOC,"I've heard people complain about the video quality on these but if I remember the video quality when it came out was about the same, it wasn't filmed in hd or anything fancy.  I got past that watching season one and was able to watch the show avidly and enjoy each episode.  I haven't gotten to this dvd set yet but watch it nightly on cable at like three am on Comcast.  So I know I like it and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good gently comedy.  Watch some on You Tube and see if it's for you, I love the whole cast and it's part of my past so I'm bias.  Have fun and enjoy, great time killer for mid day.",1421539200,2,620,3.888888888888889

6761205,5,B00OU4MTOC,"Great episodes, and has the REAL theme. The box itself is okay, but they could have sprung for a 4-box instead of stacking the disks, but that's minor, not worth docking a star from the review",1448841600,,192,4.361111111111111

6761214,5,B00OU4MTOC,Great Classic show that is still funny to this day.  All DVD packages came sealed and are in working order.  The only thing i thought was done cheap was that the discs are all stacked on one spool which could cause them to scratch in the future so knowing that i am very careful with them.,1431043200,,289,4.142857142857143

6761217,5,B00OU4MTOC,"Just writing a quick review to encourage the distributors of this series to continue releasing them in their entirety for all 11 seasons.  Looks like seasons 9 & 10 already have a release date, so we're almost there.  This is one of my very favorite tv series of all time, and I think it's great that it's getting a good release in its original form, and at such a great price :)",1430870400,,379,4.25

8684891,5,B00OU4MTOC,"more of the same issues that haunt the other season sets, episodes are compressed down to a season down to 2 discs, all 4 discs on one spindle, like past sets save time and buy a real 4 disc box, pros is the real song is back edited in, cons cheap copy and paste of the song so now the clank is heard way too late in the intro credits, low quality of editing and no special features at all, pick and choose at this point on all",1498262400,,427,3.8636363636363638

8684894,3,B00OU4MTOC,"Season Seven is pretty much a loser thanks to that nasty little snot kid they saw fit to introduce.  Thank Heaven he isn't in all the episodes and is gone by Season Eight.  Other than that, a good collection.  ""Peggy and the Pirates"" is one of the best episodes and Snotface makes a very brief appearance in it.",1483488000,,311,4.327586206896552
