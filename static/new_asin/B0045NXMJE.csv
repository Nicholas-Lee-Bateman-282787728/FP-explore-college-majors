4263383,4,B0045NXMJE,"""Micmacs"" is a French film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and is about a man and his troupe of oddballs that decide to take on two weapons manufacturers. Picture an ""Ocean's Eleven"" story told in a Terry Gilliam type manner with a group of misfits that live in a junkyard carrying out the mission.

This fanciful foray of teamwork of the underdogs to take down big tobacco, I mean big arms dealers was a fun, quirky adventure to say the least. Our main character, Bazil (Dany Boon), had taken a bullet to the head that was determined to be inoperable and has to walk around with it with the knowledge that any moment he might drop head. His father was killed in a land mine accident. Each product was from one of these companies and changed the course of his life to dropping down to street performing as a profession until he is adopted by other less fortunate cast outs.

One member of their little society is Fracasse who claimed to hold a Guinness Book world record for being a human cannon ball. La Mme Caoutchouc is a female contortionist that likes to hang out in the refrigerator as a childhood habit and becomes Bazil's love interest. Another librarian type, Calculette has a gift for numbers and statistics and can size people up upon meeting them. Petit Pierre is a shy, quiet, gifted inventor. All are gifted with a talent and take the junk found around them at the yard and try to fix it or remake it into something else until they decide to rally around Bazil's cause.

The two tyrants are pranked around the clock with increasing intensity and are set up to believe the other person is pulling the strings until brought to a major confrontation. The journey is bizarre, the people even more so, but the goal is worthwhile and the mission impossible scenarios suspenseful to watch.

This story is told in a very interesting visual format that places with the exposure and contrast in the picture along with using lots of physical comedy and communication. If you like Terry Gilliam 's fanciful style, check this one out too because you won't be disappointed in the array of different characters, story-telling technique, and cinematography.",1283817600,3,2154,4.705570291777188
4263384,3,B0045NXMJE,"I love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amlie/dp/B000068QKT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amlie</a>.  No surprise there.  Everyone does (#47 on IMDb Top 250 as I write this review).  What made Amlie work in my opinion: writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's zany creativeness + the audience's universal love for Audrey Tautou's Audrey Hepburn-esque title character.  I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Very-Long-Engagement/dp/B0007Z0NYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Very Long Engagement</a>&nbsp;for much the same reason.  In both, Jeunet balanced his wizardry with story and character development.

By comparison, Micmacs is Jeunet's full-out world of secret hidden lairs, Rube Goldberg-like contraptions and near-Benny Hill-style slapstick (you can all but hum 'Yakety Sax' at some points).  Ostensibly a comedy, it generated very few (if any) laughs at the near-to-capacity showing we attended.  I think the reason is that Jeunet plays it shallow and quick on character development here.  I know we're meant to sympathize with Dany Boon's Bazil as he and his mates carry out their intricately plotted revenge, but I wasn't compelled to work up any feeling at all.  Jeunet was too busy shooting guys out of cannons.

Two things I did like: Dominique Pinon's presence (the guy just brings a smile to my face); and the business war between rival ammunition executives portrayed by Nicolas Mari and Andr Dussollier.  Mari is especially good as the suave, new-age weapons provider with his cutting-edge fashion specs, sharp dress, decked-out bachelor pad, art collection and prominently displayed assortment of sports cars.  He's the best single thing in this movie.",1282953600,2,1751,6.337552742616034
4263385,3,B0045NXMJE,"It seems as though I have a lot of catching up to when it comes to director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With Amelie in the top 250 on IMDb and many people talking about how great both Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children are, it's definitely something I'll have to look into. In the meantime, before Micmacs Alien: Resurrection had been the only film of Jeunet's that I'd seen. It had been way too long since my last viewing of that, so I didn't make the connection that it was the same director until after Micmacs was over. There are quite a lot of positive reviews and comments about Micmacs all over the internet, so I felt like I had to see it. Unfortunately, it didn't click with me as much as it did with others.

The film does have a unique look to it that was originally what grabbed a hold of my interest. The first thing that comes to mind is how quirky and eccentric the animation and visual effects are. Whether it's the mechanical creatures Petit Pierre creates with recycled materials or the unusual bits of animation in the film, it's all incredibly eye catching.

The biggest element the film is missing, however, is character development. There really seems to be not much of any in this film. You're introduced to these oddball characters, but then the rest of the film is devoted to this intricate plan on how to take down these two weapons manufacturers. Even the one subplot that has two of the characters fall in love doesn't get enough screen time. It's like the film becomes too wrapped up and involved within its own whimsical desires to really establish much of anything else. To add to that, the film isn't really funny despite being labeled as a comedy. It has its short lived charming moments that will put a smile on your face, but there's maybe one or two scenes that might make you snicker audibly.

Micmacs devotes too much time to its playfully involved and original tale of revenge that results in you not really caring about the characters by the time the film ends. It's visually stunning, but has little to offer other than fantastic visuals that ooze creativity from every frame. Despite being a rather elaborate tale of revenge, the film is slightly reminiscent of what Michel Gondry's take on Snatch would be like. Whether that's good or bad lies entirely within the person viewing the film.",1280966400,4,2331,4.612048192771084
4263386,5,B0045NXMJE,"I managed to see Micmacs and thoroughly loved it. In true Jeunet fashion, characters have their specific quirks and little side-plot elements abound through the movie. A lot of what make movies like Delicatessen, Amelie, and City of Lost Children have this sometimes absurd but magical fantasy about them is present here but not overly gratuitous. Just the right amount and exactly how you'd expect it.

I've likened this movie to Three Stooges meets the A-Team versus Goliath. Really, two Goliaths. The plot is that Bazil's dad get blown up trying to defuse a mine made by a arms company. Later in his life, he is accidentally shot and the bullet is that of another competing arms company. Seeking justice, Bazil tries to confront the companies but is rebuffed quite strongly. He's then adopted by a rag-tag bunch of ""orphans"" called the Micmacs of the Slide Whistle who then join together to help Bazil take down the arms companies who have destroyed his life.

In true Jeunet fashion, we are introduced to each character who has a special talent that is exploited for the purpose of bringing down the arms companies. The plot, sometimes absurd and hilarious and not intended to be taken so seriously (as one reviewer earlier apparently doesn't get it). It's a comedy first and foremost and has all the hallmarks we've come to know and love from Jeunet. It doesn't move as fast as Amelie or have the sometimes overwhelming fantasy and magic of City of Lost Children but, in its own right, moves at a pace appropriate for the characters. And of course, Dominique Pinon is just over the top and brilliant as usual. Well done.",1280793600,33,1625,4.779359430604982
4263387,5,B0045NXMJE,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelie/dp/B0000640VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelie</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-City-of-Lost-Children/dp/B00000K3TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The City of Lost Children</a>&nbsp;belong to those films that, although, you find strange when you sit through it for the very first time, they stay with you forever. I find the director (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) to be Europe's answer to David Lynch - only a tad heavier on the regressive images and lighter on the subconscious horrors. So when he had another film out, I was not going to miss it. And, once more, I was glad I did.

A bunch of eccentrics (each with his or hers own quirky character and unusual personal history) come together by life's caprice and end up undertaking an impossible task: try to take down the two largest arms manufacturers in the country. Ingenious ideas, impossible retro gadgets (handmade from salvaged materials), and an unwavering sense of justice. No sacrifice is too big if it means making the villains pay for their crimes.

The colors are soft and comforting; the imagery is mesmerizing; the music will take you back to a more naive age; and the story will make you laugh, cry and laugh again. All in all, great entertainment!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1280016000,59,1363,6.051813471502591
4263388,5,B0045NXMJE,"MicMacs has a plot that defies summation, characters who each are more fantastic than the next, and the sheer joie de vivre that Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to all of his delightful works. Here his clowns are up against the true clowns of today's world--vicious, selfish, heartless arms dealers. The boys and girls on Our Side must dive deep into their junkyard to find the tools to defeat these evil beings. And just why are they doing it? Because it's right, that's why! Needless to say, the baddies are defeated, the goodies are triumphant, and the whole flies by like a many-ringed circus performance.",1278892800,20,603,4.864077669902913
4263389,2,B0045NXMJE,"Micmacs is a small, french film that must be viewed in the theater to produce the smallest amount of joy. In no way is this an interactive film as The Rocky Horror how is, but in witnessing the laughter of members of the audience, it may be possible to endure this film with a skeptical grin.

Micmas is a jumbled mess that involves the orphaned Bazil who is in critical condition after being hit by a gunshot, but miraculously survives. Having lost job, and with no prior savings, he is forced to hit the streets and find his living through unconventional methods. To his good luck he meets the Slammer, himself an ex-con, who introduces him to a group of individuals, with varied talents, who have chosen to live in a dump. Varyingly artistic and athletic, these individuals choose to adopt Bazil by way of an obscure selection process. Bazil eventually becomes aware of identity of the individuals and organization(s) who were responsible for nearly ending his life. Unable to take action by himself, he enlists the talents of his new brothers and sisters in divulging the true identity of these despicable people.

Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is well known for his exquisite characters studies, but going awry devotes little time on his characters in this picture. It actually seems like Jeunet has no interest in developing these characters as Bazil and his new-found characters lack personality; all that is known is that one of them is an artist, the other a contortionist and etc. Not only does this limited information make them seem superficial, but also unable the actors to give better performances. For their characters to become convincing and pleasant the actors have to deliver bombastic and overblown performances to conceal their weakly written characters.

Jeunet has admitted that Micmacs was largely influenced by silent comedy with scenes that seem to be replicas of the old comedy masters-such as Buster Keaton. Were Chaplin, Keaton,  and Lloyd were whimsical, Jeunet is overindulgent and lacks the sense of control in guiding the comedic elements. Rather than serving as an administrator over the picture, he is too absorbed by the gags and special effects to comprehend where whimsy becomes just becomes wasteful and pathetic. Silent comedy functions greatly, to this day, because their humor is substitutes for their shortage of dialogue. Micmacs uses comedy to conceal its weakness in storytelling.

With the Home Alone series families received a unique experience as the envisioned gags of the series, despite their excessive nature, were so basic in their conception that they still remained hilarious. Micmacs's gags are as excessive as the Home Alone series, but are also substantially sophistication. The success of the gags is impressive, but is undercut by the realization that there must have been a dozen easier methods of completing the mission of the film. The gags are so flawless that it seems that the raw materials for these gags are always too conveniently within the reach of our heroes. The gags are exquisitely done, but their technical value pales when it is realized that Jeunet's attempt is to carry the film on the weight of the gags alone.

Micmacs is among those cute, little, French films that Jeunet, as the director of Amelie, has proved more than able to conceive time and time again. The difference is that unlike his other films, in this instance he lacks an approach. Many may find the film funny, but as a whole Micmacs is a hallow mess.",1278720000,14,3497,4.97945205479452

Something of a blend of THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX, MYSTERY MEN and THE TALL BLONDE MAN WITH ONE BLACK SHOE as shot through the lens of AMELIE, it is a treat to enjoy. It's a good bit darker than AMELIE, and the characters aren't quite as lovable or well-developed as that movie, but the storyline is topical and at times profound, the capers and quirks are satisfying and the milieu is almost as engaging as the earlier movie.
Dany Boon is good as a man damaged by industrial greed and avarice, and Andre Dussolier and Nicholas Marie are truly outstanding as his nemeses - Marie's character Marconi in particular is a deep study of the archetypal smooth profit-at-any-cost monster. Rubber-faced Dominique Pinon and Yolande Moreau return and are wonderful as always. The effects and rube-goldberg contraptions are delightful whimsy, and it keeps you laughing and engaged the whole time - except for one scene near the end which makes you think, deep, long and hard **. I recommend it.

This eclectic group of unusual characters becomes Brazil's allies in a plot to turn two arms manufactures against one another, and help them see the error of their ways.

Following a group of homeless people with a variety of unusual skills, we see them plan and carry out their own unique brand of revenge on a pair of arms manufacturers with often hilarious results.

As others have mentioned this film is shot with soft light and it is also infused with a certain sense of humour.  I love the little touches like when a car drives by the exact same scene was portrayed on a billboard above them as an advert.  Small and silly, but it shows the attention to detail.

The plot is relatively simple, but completely engaging and everyone acts their roles very well.  It does feel VERY French at times and if you enjoy French film then this should be right up your street.

This has quite a gentle pace to it and I found it enjoyable enough and whilst it isn't as amazing as some 5 star reviews make out, it isn't nearly as dire as others have said either.  It is a stylised piece of film making, with a decent story and decent acting and made for an entertaining evenings viewing.  I'd say it's at least worth a go.

4263597,3,B0045NXMJE,"Not only am I a big fan of French film, I am also a big fan of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Suffice to say, I was really excited about this movie.  Sadly, while the tone of the film was certainly in line with what I expected from this modern master of cinematic enjoyment (yes, I said it), I must admit that this film failed to do much of anything for me.  It is loud and charismatic and a carnival of sorts, but in the end it just seems like a hodgepodge of mediocrity.

Saying that makes me very sad.

Don't get me wrong; I love the macabre and the absurd, which are two things that Jean-Pierre Jeunet understands and it is precisely why I love him so much.  I mean, I don't have to explain to anyone my adoration of `Amelie', and that is considered by many to be one of his lesser works; so know that I love him THAT much.  That said; while `Micmacs' certainly is entertaining and it has that whole `absurd' quality that I love so much, it fails to balance it out with anything substantial.  At least `Amelie' knew how to create an absurdity that teetered on emotional complexity; something that felt human and lived in and truly cherished.  `Micmacs' feels slightly underdeveloped; like a gimmick tossed on a plate for minimal effect.

The film follows a bunch of freaks as they embark on a mission to turn two major players in arms dealing against one another and create major problems for them; all the while helping one particular freak exact semi-revenge on the company responsible for his father's death and the company who produced the bullet that haphazardly found its way into his skull.

Get all that?

I like the story.  It has so much promise, and in the capable hands of Jeunet I'd expect it to be embellished to perfection, but it wasn't.  It was just a silly mess that never seemed to go anywhere important, and then when they did try and make some sort of poignant point about arms dealing (that whole ending) it came across manipulative and out of bounds with the rest of the film.

I still have faith in Jeunet.  Every director is allowed a misstep here and there.  Even the greats have had their fair share of failed projects.

At least Raphael Beau's score is effectively awesome.",1307404800,3,2204,4.481203007518797

The gadgetry and Parisian backgrounds (mostly in non-tourist venues) are a rich canvas for the antics, however improbable, of this troup. The characters are mostly believable and well-drawn. The movie's only flaw is that the subtitles are not complete. I can't comment on accuracy since I am not a Francophone. But there are several segments when the characters are singing or speaking and the subtitles are absent. Most subtitling of foreign films for Anglophone audiences is poor quality and it's this kind of carelessness that turns people off from subtitled films they would otherwise enjoy.

But, with fantasy of this calibre, you just have to take it in its own terms, whatever the heck those are.

This starts with gritty urban credibility. As a boy, Bazil's father is killed by a weapon from one dealer. As an adult, he's nearly killed by a weapon from another. Brain-injured but capable, he finds a new home among an urban salon de refusees - the people refused by the rest of society. The take him in as one of their own and with him, his mission for revenge. From there, Micmacs creates a beautiful assemblage of slapstick, political commentary, personal warmth, and intellectual goofing. Each character (and they are characters) contributes in his or her own way. Early on, though, I glommed onto the contortionist. Really, she has a central spot in all the good scenes.

Fun, fantasical, and fairly flaky, I wish this for everyone with a taste for the quirky.

Amelie, City of Children (La cit des enfants perdus), Delicatessen, etc...all exceptional movies and all having those surrealistic, fantastical, whimsical-laden settings and heart-tugging story lines that Jean-Pierre Jeunet does so well.  Micmacs seems very much in the same vein of his previous films with a minor exception for me.  I just didn't feel the character development was on par with his previous works.  That one little ingredient in a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film that usually cements the experience for me is a level of empathetic bonding with the characters.  He's phenomenal at portraying and visualizing a character's emotional response in a way that is so easy to relate to, usually in a very child-like and innocent way.

And that's where this movie just didn't quite reach the same bar as the rest of his works (for me anyway). The cinematography and set design were, per usual, incredible.  The story line is interesting and entertaining, and the ensemble of characters he's created have that magical element, but I can't say I felt the same level of emotional connection to the characters as I have in his past movies.  It seemed like he didn't have enough time to develop the background and pull the viewer in so effortlessly, say like the opening sequence in Amelie (still one of my all-time favorite sequences in a movie).

If you like Jean-Pierre Jeunet films, I expect you'll like this.

That such as Amelie, The City of Lost Children, Delicatessen, and even the more serious story of A Very Long Engagement, but his latest film, this ""Micmacs"" really kinda drags.

I like Jeunet's style.  He has this rather yellowish background atmosphere (as if it was filmed 40 years ago or so), and even has a background score sounds as if it was from ages ago.  And I love that.  His earlier films all reflect that.

But, it wasn't enough to help me stay within this story.  I was lost after the first 30 minutes of this film, and I tried to maintain non-boredom from that point forward, but boredom succeeded and I was lost from then on, to the end of the movie.

4263620,4,B0045NXMJE,"Jean Pierre Jeunet is one crazy film director. His thought processes are entirely singular. Watching one of his movies is like watching a Rube Goldberg machine. All these goofy things happen, along a circuitous route, but in the end it all works.

Micmacs might not be his best best movie but it's still a lot of fun to watch. The basic outline of the plot is fairly simple. The film's hero, Bazil (played delightfully by Dany Boon) has a bullet lodged in his noggin. He got it as an innocent bystander in a robbery attempt. If the doctors yank the bullet he could become a vegetable. If they leave it in he could die. The decision is made by the flip of a coin. Also, he lost his father to a land mine. So now, with the help of a loose-knit family of people, occupying space in a junk yard, (they are the Micmacs of the title) he tries to bring down the two arms manufacturers responsible for the bullet and the land mine. They devise an intricat plot, fueled by an array of weird gadgets honed together from detritus in the junk yard, to do the deed.

Jeunet uses a similar color palette to the one he used in 'A very Long Engagement' with a lot of yellows and golds. As usual, it's a great looking movie where not a frame is wasted. It has the usual array of crazy characters and great attention is given to even the most minute of details.

Where it falters a bit is in the script. The beginning is a bit clunky. Not enough time is given to our meeting the Micmacs and his building a relationship with them. They ""adopt"" him, and in a heartbeat, they're off on their mission. Also, this movie is set in the here and now so his sense of whimsy doesn't work as well as it has in his other films. As a jaded society, we realize that there is no way these people will get anywhere near enough to these arms manufacturers to pull off their stunt. He also needed to do a better job building the romance between Bazil and the contortionist. That all happens just a bit too quickly.

That being said, this is still a wild ride. If you're already a fan of his or Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton you should have a fine time with this.",1292630400,2,2124,4.237037037037037

4263622,4,B0045NXMJE,"Many people will dismiss this film as ""more of the same"". But when ""the same"" is a film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, that's more than OK, in fact it's an exercise in creative film making. Here Jeunet uses his quirky signature style to tell the tale of Bazil whose father was killed by a land mine and who himself has a bullet lodged in his head from a freak accident. With the help of a bunch of misfits, he seeks revenge on the arms dealers and manufacturers with hilarious results.
This is not ""Amelie"" - I don't think Jeunet will ever surpass that - but it's a well made, fun film that you just can't help but watch. Much of the comedy comes and goes in split seconds, so keep your eyes open wide.
Danny Boon is wonderful as Bazil and he is supported by the usually zany assortment of Jeunet loonies- who maybe aren't so loony after all. There's alot of logic and truth hidden in all of them.
I have the Canadian DVD issue which has been around since September and it is an absolutely beautiful widescreen print that does justice to Jeunet's muted color schemes.
You may like or hate this movie, but once you start you'll keep watching just to see what Jeunet will do next.",1289347200,3,1170,4.34703196347032
4263623,5,B0045NXMJE,"I am extremely selective in choosing DVDs for my library. In fact, I own a total of four. When I saw Micmacs at the cinema my friend told me to settle down, I was laughing so hard. The French have done it again, the way only they can...",1288742400,,236,3.9375
4263624,5,B0045NXMJE,"this is simply everything I want in a movie. It's charming, it's whimsical, it's a win for the good guys, it's creating a family out of unrelated, odd people that works (much better than most families that are related work,) it's lovely - I felt good when I left the theater and this is the one movie from this year that I'm buying.

Don't get me wrong, I loved ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" - outstanding movies in every possible way - but I'm not going to buy them and watch them again. So, this is not a review by someone who has to have cute and sweet in her movies. But it is a review by a real movie buff, and a movie buff who has some standards - as in, if you can't entertain me, I won't watch your movie! Mic Mac's entertained, it entranced, and at the end I left feeling that the world is a place where decent, caring relationships can happen, and that sometimes, just sometimes, the bad guys get theirs. That's a perfectly reasonable, even desirable, way to leave the theater.

I refuse to accept that a requirement for a good movie is that it is full of sturm und drang - that's just baloney sixties thinking - and also ""I'm too cool to like fun stuff that isn't obscene and/or stupid or both"" thinking. As an adult I find that it's very difficult to find movies to enjoy. Usually movie makers can't find their way through the maze of amusing - bosoms and bottoms - or blowing up something every 10 minutes. This movie maker can make a movie. I am grateful whenever I find one who can. I strongly recommend it.",1288483200,3,1562,4.255892255892256
4263625,4,B0045NXMJE,"When his father was killed by a landmine it drove his mother insane, so Bazil grew up effectively an orphan.  Now an adult, he works in a video store and is obsessed by old movies whose lines he learned by heart.  When a stray bullet ricochets into his brain and the doctors are afraid to operate, he loses his job and ends up on the streets, finally to be adopted by a bizarre band of tinkerers and circus-style ""freaks.""  He decides to enlist their help in his personal quest to take inventive revenge against the CEOs of the weapons manufacturers he believes responsible for his personal tragedies.

It's both whimsical and poignant, silly and serious.  Each of the members of his new ragtag family has something unique to offer, that turns out to be exactly what they need in their efforts to strike a blow at the military industrial complex.  There is the contortionist and the human calculator, the human cannonball and the collector of cliches; these and others allow him to infiltrate the lives of his nemeses, and create unpredictable havoc, all in the service of a brilliant scheme.  Things don't always go according to plan, but it's never less than hilariously inventive - even where it's clear that the stakes are deadly serious, and that Jeunet himself has an important agenda.  In its whimsy, and its resemblance to classic silent comedy, and for its visual inventiveness, the film feels like a return to the lighthearted dark comedy styling of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Delicatessen/dp/B000E8NRUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Delicatessen</a>&nbsp;(and there's a wonderful moment here that is a very direct reminder of that film), but there's more at stake here and the fantasy realm he invents is embedded in a reality that is manifestly that of our world.
