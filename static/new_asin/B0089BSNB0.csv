8526272,5,B0089BSNB0,"These are a lot better than I was expecting.  They're like miniature, twenty minute 1940s gangster movies.  Sure wish they were on pressed DVDs instead of DVD-Rs. No subtitles.",1507680000,,176,5.0344827586206895
8526273,4,B0089BSNB0,"These are surprisingly well done. Short crime stories that sometimes have a surprising twist ending thanks to good scriptwriters. They appeared to have had high budgets. I enjoyed these and am glad I bought this collection. Nostalgic, interesting, and suspenseful.",1489708800,,264,5.625

8526275,5,B0089BSNB0,"PLOT: shorts using MGM stars about CRIME VS CRIMINALS who always get caught.

before CSI the general public goes to the ""movie short"" ~
MGM made these 20 min features topic is always crime and how they got caught.,

made from 1935-1947

Disc One: BEST one is The Perfect SET up: electronic genius turns criminal and helps robbers by pass electronic security systems.

Disc two: They are Always Caught: Radio crusader DA bumps off the local mayor who catches on he is playing both sides of the law. Early use of a spectrograph and fiber detection makes his crime to be solved. LATER made into a movie: Kid Glove Alibi with Van Heflin.

Disc three: BEST While America Sleeps~ aircraft worker earns some extra cash from the AXIS spies by taking photos of secrets bomber and bombsight designs.

Disc four: BEST: Coffin on Wheels.....clever car dealers know how to make a car run including brake pads made of paper.

Disc five: BEST: Don't Talk...the FBI are watching a caf where war plan and war workers are spilling secrets to the Enemy. Several excellent World War 2 ...shorts on this disc.

Dis 6: two really outstanding ones. A GUN IN HIS HAND has a crook becoming a cop so he use scientific ways to avoid detection and commit crimes. The Luckiest Guy in the World: Barry Nelson helps himself to cash, then accidentally kills his wife, covers up his own death and assumes the identity of a man he kills.

many good MGM stars are used: Berry Nelson, ROBERT Taylor, Loraine Day, Van Johnson and many others. The crimes are always well written and have a twist that allows the near perfect crime to fail.

each disc has at least 9 stories on each DVD. several were nominated for Oscars. This dvd set is well done and keeps you interested how the criminal gets ""his"" or ""hers"" in just 20 minutes.",1428537600,3,1792,4.571875
8526276,4,B0089BSNB0,"Good product at a good price.  Performances of obviously date material are very good.  I bought this for a friend, who shares my evaluation.",1384128000,,140,4.791666666666667
8526277,5,B0089BSNB0,"Unlike the other review, all six of these discs played fine for me. I really enjoyed these shorts from both an historical perspective and for entertainment value. After watching them for a while, they become quite formulaic, but this in itself is quite entertaining to see as the absurdly greedy criminals go to no lengths to make a quick buck. For example, in one of the shorts involving a racketing scheme on a children's charity hospital, the thugs that set up the fake charity come to an impasse when they refuse back payment on an iron lung keeping a little girl alive; if the girl just happens to die, they can return the machine to keep their cash flow in; as one of them remarks to his boss, ""It's that little kid that's gummin' up the works. I got an idea..."" The boss replies, ""I don't want to hear it...But if you have a plan, be careful."" We then see the thug in a dark alley smashing up the fuse box to cut the power to the iron lung. Inevitably, in each episode, the police outsmart the criminals with their crime labs, undercover work and detective skills. Later in the series, the design of each story becomes a bit more sophisticated, while the subjects become more obscure and unlikely to affect the lives of your average viewer, shifting the tone of the series from informative/newsreel style to the fatalistic nature of the film noir of the era. The last of the series, ""The Luckiest Man Alive"" is especially entertaining in this respect. I would recommend this to any fan of classic American crime. As the back of the case describes, this series is a study of mankind's most seductive and destructive pastime -- crime.",1353110400,3,1639,4.578231292517007
8526278,1,B0089BSNB0,"The contents of this set are quite an eye opener, that is those disks which will even play instead of reading disk error.
I intend to exchange my copy for a replacement. Every other made to order Warner Archives DVD has been able to play in my
DVD player. Of the six disks included in this set I have only been able to play 2. The product is essentially trash and I
could not recommend it to anyone until Warners gets it's copying problems resolved. The difficulties with attempting to play
this set has essentially ruined the show for me.",1347667200,5,539,4.4
