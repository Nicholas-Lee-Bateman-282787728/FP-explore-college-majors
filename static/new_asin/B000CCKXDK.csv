8097393,4,B000CCKXDK,"When the idea for making a motion picture version of ""Grease"" was approved by the moguls at Paramount back in 1977 the studio gave producers Robert Stigwood and Allan Carr a budget of $6,000,000 to complete the project.  The conventional wisdom in Hollywood was that the film would generate lots of enthusiasm initially, make a neat profit and gradually fade away as the vast majority of films do.  No one could have ever predicted the magnitude of the hit they would have on their hands.  ""Grease""  opened in over 800 theaters on March 27, 1978.  The critics were not that impressed but audiences loved it.  They still do. Not only would ""Grease"" become the top grossing motion picture of 1978 but when all was said and done ""Grease"" would become the highest grossing movie musical of all-time with a worldwide gross of some $387,000,000!

I think the main reason that ""Grease"" has remained so popular over the decades is that it truly is a fun movie.  There are so many films out there featuring blood and guts that a film like ""Grease"" is a welcome oasis for many of us.  This is a film that features a fabulous musical score, innovative choreography and a remarkable chemistry among the members of a highly talented cast.  Everyone seemed to love the performances by the film's two stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Travolta loved the stage play and lobbied hard to play the part of Danny Zuko in the film.  Meanwhile, Olivia Newton-John was intrigued when offered the role of Sandy by the producers but insisted on a screen test to make sure she was right for the role.  As it turned out she was just perfect.  The chemistry between these two and their enthusiasm for this project is quite apparent from the very first scene in the film.  Meanwhile,  Jeff Conaway, who played Danny Zuko in the Broadway production of ""Grease""  adds his considerable talent to the mix in the role of Danny's best buddy Kenickie.  And let us not forget the noteworthy contributions of  Stockyard Channing and Didi Conn in the roles of Rizzo and Frenchy.  Finally, the producers added to the appeal of this film by including several 1950's icons in the cast including Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell and Fannie Flagg.  It was a nice touch.

I think most folks would agree that what makes ""Grease"" so doggone appealing  is the sensational  music.  The film spawned four Top Five singles in 1978 including ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Summer Lovin"" and the #1 smash ""You're The One That I Want"".  At the same time the soundtrack LP was a monster hit as well.  Other notable tunes from the film include Stockyard Channing's surprisingly powerful ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do"",  John Travolta's ""Sandy"" and 50's teen idol Frankie Avalon (playing a teen angel) doing""Beauty School Dropout"".  The film concludes with the entire cast  cut loose at an amusement park singing ""We Go Together"".  I enjoy these tunes just as much today as I did  then!  Furthermore,  I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredibly innovative animated open to this flick that goes a long way in getting viewers in the proper frame of mind  to enjoy what follows.

Nearly four decades after it's release ""Grease"" continues to delight audiences of all ages.  It possesses a universal appeal that is rare in motion pictures these days.  In addition, it is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.  I recently purchased the ""Rockin' Rydell Edition""  that was released by Paramount in 2006.  This disc contains tons of extra features that really will enhance your enjoyment of this film.  This is a solid four star package. Highly recommended!",1455580800,,3661,4.764331210191083
