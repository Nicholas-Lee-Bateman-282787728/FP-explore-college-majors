3509294,5,B001CDFY6Y,"Hard to review this film without trying to find a connection to your own life that parallels anything close to what the main character goes through. There is so much that can be stated about what this film touches upon, including second chances, media persecution, love, friendship, youthful indiscretions, homicidal tendencies, being a hero to a child and so on.

I admit I had to turn on the subtitles to understand half of what got said, but in the end I am glad I didn't miss a word. Garfield played a phenomenal performance that deserves all of the recognition he got; A powerful future he has in acting. This story of a young man getting a second chance at life after a childhood murder he is involved in gets intertwined with his present day life; an adequate pacing of this child's miserable existence coupled with his chance at living a life he never got. I find myself watching it again as I write this to see what I missed in the editing.

The ""What's your name"" line edited to the tombstone in the first ten minutes gives you an idea of what to expect with the rest of the film. And I feel they did an incredible job throughout. So much of what I heard and saw makes me recall my days as a US Expat working with some outcast Brits (in so many ways). I highly recommend this film and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Most people know I do not recount the story of a film, so I hope they take my word when I say to watch this film all the way to the end, and I hope someone will email me someday and tell me where that Boardwalk is - reminiscent of things in my own life; would love to see it first hand someday..",1223337600,5,1630,4.237942122186495

But the performances of the actors and actresses are amazing, the character development is apparent, and the film is filled with passion.  It does make you rethink to a degree.  However, I don't believe many criminal kids show much remorse in real life.

3509346,5,B001CDFY6Y,"This formidable film coopts the heart in stages, rather than in a full-on assault. This is a measured, thoughtful, deeply empathic story of a 24-year-old man, just released from prison, under the apparent guardianship of Terry (Peter Mullan),  a rehabilitation worker.  Jack (Andrew Garfield), advised by Terry, has just chosen his new name. As a preteen, Jack, identified as Boy A, was tried with Boy B, and found guilty of the murder of a young girl. The story, which chronicles all of Jack's dealings with work, peers, love, community is credible and compelling. In this honest screenplay (Mark O'Rowe), there's no clarion call for a resounding belief in the rehabilitaton of the child offender.  It does certainly marshal considerable sympathy for the awkward, beleaguered Jack, who still maintains some propensity  for violence. And we root for him, as we see him now and in flashbacks to his disturbing childhood. This film is outstanding on all levels, including cinematography, editing--  all disciplines. The acting is top-notch,  particularly by the 2 leads, under the skillful direction of John Crowley. Wisely, the piece leaves us in that authentic, albeit uncomfortable, domain of ambiguity. We don't have all the answers, not by a long shot, and that's how the story seems intended. But we do have lots to consider.  An accomplished film.  Highly recommend.",1480550400,5,1371,5.2
3509347,5,B001CDFY6Y,"Great movie - it never ceases to amaze me how many good movies don't get seen due to lack of publicity.

3509362,4,B001CDFY6Y,"The numbers speak for themselves. Theres a reason all 56 reviews at this time are positive, and its a surprising reason for me. Normally a story line told like this heavily relies on the events of the crime, or the promise of revealing the shocking details of the crime, to keep viewers invested in any compelling way. I cant say that about this film and that is 100% due to the performance of Andrew Garfield. By the time i got to the final act i didn't even care about the past of ""Jack"". I was just rooting for him to succeed. I hate to use an industry term, especially one so often misused to excuse bad film making, but this is a great character piece.

3509367,4,B001CDFY6Y,"I was afraid this would be a plea for understanding and forgivenes but I'm glad to say it was not.  It is based on a terrible crime committed in England some years ago when two ten year old children kidnapped a two year old baby and tortured the baby to death. The boys were released from prison at the end of their prison term and given new identities.  By then they were young men. This made-for-television movie did soften the crime (possibly for legal reasons) but the movie Boy A still committed a terrible crime led along by the other boy involved. Yet, to justify the world's absolute revulsion against Boy A you needed that real life crime.  Boy A himself appears to have changed by the time of his release and to have developed a conscience, though there are moments when the potential for violence still seems  to be inside him. He is trying his hardest to adjust to life outside  prison and to his new identity. He is not dangerous but he has to pretend he isn't who he is, and lives in fear of being found out. Though one feels sympathy for him he cannot escape his past.  He has been stamped with the mark of Cain.  An interesting aspect of the movie is that the therapist who considers Boy A his greatest triumph is a man in sad need of insight himself.  In the end he can't his escape his own past. I did have a problem with the regional working-class accents of the characters . A better sound track would have helped.",1446940800,,1434,4.344569288389513
3509368,5,B001CDFY6Y,"Friends in the UK explained that this film was banned due to it's incendiary nature, dealing with a real life case in England, of two pre adolescent boys beating and stabbing a girl to death.  That said, the emerging genre of American, British, Czech, Australian films these last ten years based on true events has, burgeoned.  ""Boy A"" narrates the story of one of the boys released from prison and taking a new identity within the society that was horrified by the actual events.  (This genre has become a benchmark of The Weinstein Company.)  So with the conflict established (self vs. society) the narrative line is finely depicted by director John Crowley, adroitly keeping his directorial hands off, rather letting the story tell itself.  Boy A is given a residence, job, while fearing his true identity (always an interesting gambit in this age of social media) will be revealed by chance.  Ah, so it goes.  The girlfriend who loves and believes in him, the adult friend and mentor, it could be Lear or the Prisoner of Zenda seeking to reestablish and rebirth himself as he balances events, lies, precariously.  The whole twilight dance, between the darkened criminal past, and the light of being a regular bloke, making his way in the world, is more prevalent than viewers might think.  Probably most engrossing is how you, (one, me, the viewer) is led to walk in Boy A's shoes, and empathize both with this negligent upbringing which ripened him to fall prey to the victim's taunting.  Fine film, represents one aspect of society's huge burden since both parents had to enter the workplace to make a living.  Fragile morality, to be sure.",1441238400,2,1646,4.8428571428571425

This movie is about Jack (Andrew Garfield) who committed a horrible crime when he was young and then is released from jail as a young adult.  He now has a new lease on life and wants to only do good now.  I don't want to ruin what happens, but I would definitely recommend this movie to people, but it's more of a one time watch and see type of movie.

It's story of a boy who wants to lead a normal life after committing a serious crime in his youth. It's also a story of loss childhood, love found then loss, and betrayal.

Andrew Garfield is at his finest - he won a BAFTA for his performance in this movie. If you haven't done so already, you should check out his performance in the Amazing Spiderman, in which he embodies the awkwardness of Peter Parker and wise-cracking antics of Spiderman.",1373587200,,482,4.540229885057471
3509382,5,B001CDFY6Y,"which by the way is something this films about.
I've never seen any of these actors before besides Peter Mullen but all the actors in this movie were excellent and so was the story.
I hate it when I read reviews where the people writing them basically tell you the entire story, theirs then no reason to watch it. So let me just say it's about a young abused bullied boy who gets involved in something terrible, then as a young adult gets a second chance in life.
This story was brilliantly told and extremely sad.
It's a little hard as a American to understand the thick English accents and I found myself going back again to figure out what the hell the words I could not understand were, but this movies was well worth that small bit of effort.
 I also like movies filmed in England. Some parts were filmed in gritty areas and others in the country side's which I find to be very beautiful and in the background the sky looks like it's always on the verge of rain, this helps add to the atmosphere of the film.
Anyway, if your interested in a great story, with great acting, great characters and a interesting country you'll like this movie.

3509385,5,B001CDFY6Y,Boy A is a good movie for anyone who is starting to get caught up in being bad or hanging out with someone who is bad. The movie touches home life with enough information to see how quickly sadness and loneliness can turn into tragedy. The young man gets a second chance and the movie portrays the struggles of a person trying to fit in and get along with others who know very little about his real life...the movie is heartbreaking from beginning to end so prepare yourself..this movie gave me more compassion and empathy toward young kids who just do not have support or encouragement. It also made me angry that Boy A was so easily influenced and did not choose right from wrong because I think he had common sense but life was happening too fast for him and one thing led to another and before he could stop it evil had already trapped him. We must remember to be kind and try to show interest to those we know are struggling because one kind word or a conversation can lead someone to a better way or the devil will set in and befriend one.,1364169600,,1045,4.309644670050761
3509386,5,B001CDFY6Y,Andrew Garfield is magnificent. How can anyone show so much raw emotion in a movie role? Incredible. The script was fantastic as well as the supporting actors. If only this movie was brought over to the US in cinemas. It would win every major award in town.,1356652800,,257,4.48936170212766
3509387,5,B001CDFY6Y,"This is a wonderful film with an outstanding performance by Andrew Garfield. He plays a young man just being released from prison after serving time for murdering a young girl -- a crime he comitted when he was quite young and under the influence of another young boy who came from an abusive home. In flashbacks we see what led him to commit this crime.

The crime was sensationalized by the press at the time the crime was comitted and, upon his release, reports of his being released from prison have been published. He must establish a new identity so that the press can't reveal his whereabouts as he has received many death threats. He is helped by a social worker who has worked with him for several years and who finds him a new identity, a place to live, and a job.

The film shows the challenges he faces in keeping his past hidden from the new friends he is making,  Andrew Garfield gives a very sensitive portrayal of the young man and shows his desire to reveal his identity so that he can live a truthful life and one where he doesn't have to hide who he is.

This is a very moving film and shows great sensitivity and understanding about the abuse and neglect that led to a horrendous crime being comitted by two very young boys, and how the character played by Mr. Garfield has been able to rehabilitate himself and rejoin the community at large.",1355097600,,1362,4.436
3509388,5,B001CDFY6Y,"I had never heard of this movie and I don't really know the actors in it. What made me want to watch it is that it was loosely based on a true story.

I'll be honest. I fell in love with Jack the moment he appeared on screen. He seemed really innocent and sweet and I couldn't help but love him. The ending had me in tears. It was so sad to me that even the people Jack got close to shunned him, like they didn't know the amazing person he turned out to be after the past ordeal.

3509399,4,B001CDFY6Y,"""Boy A"" is a very difficult movie. It's also a very good movie--which makes it even more difficult. The story it tells, of Jack Burridge (a reformed convict who re-enters society after having served time in prison for a heinous crime he committed as a child), straddles the line between righteousness and sympathy. The film's narrative is structured perfectly--the story of the present-day Jack is intercut with flashbacks to his previous life as Eric, and just as our sympathy for Jack has reached its height, we are confronted with the grim reality of his past crime. Moral complications abound--just as Jack seems to have attained some stability in his new life, an act of selfless heroism thrusts him into the media spotlight, creating tragic implications. Andrew Garfield is masterful as Jack, and the largely unknown supporting cast is solid. Not a movie for those who like their films unambiguous, but if you've ever wondered what life might be like when your deepest, darkest secret is exposed, you will not be able to tear your eyes away from this one.",1316908800,,1061,4.932960893854749
3509400,5,B001CDFY6Y,"So after seeing Andrew Garfield in The Social Network, I've decided to see how well the young man can act & after viewing this charm of a movie I was able to I've come to a conclusion that he is not a bad actor at all. Actually quite enjoyable on screen.

Boy A follows the life of ""Jack Burridge"" (Beautifully portrayed by Andrew Garfield), which is a mysteriously chosen name from the young man in the movie after he is being secretly released from prison due to a crime he and another boy committed when they were much younger. The amount of footage put in from the earlier times when Jack was a kid was just the right amount. Unlike a movie that would just put the first half hour as someone's childhood, the director wonderfully edited flashbacks into the film and periodically placed them into it to add more questions and build more interest to what the boys did to be incriminated when they were younger. I won't spoil anything for you because the film is fantastic and really offers that question of ""Who decides who gets a second chance""? Jack Burridge has a bruised soul yet a very strong heart, but due to his lack of being nurtured properly, he is on a verge of an emotional collapse. While he is ""technically"" given his second chance, we follow Jack to see whether he will move on with his life or be pulled back into the life he once had, become the boy that he once was again? The film offers most of every emotion there is. Before taking a turn into becoming a psychological suspense, you are given laughter, love, hope, and a point of view of someone trying to adjust to world, tyring to work, have a girlfriend, have friends, but due to a past from his childhood, it may be tougher than expected. I recommend this for everyone, though some will differ on the ending of the film. I hope I've been helpful..

3509401,5,B001CDFY6Y,"Here's proof yet again that the Brits outshine just about everyone else in making movies, even when working with a small budget.

Andrew Garfield is superb as Jack Burridge.  If there's any other young actor today who can convey angst, humor and all-out likability as well as he can, I don't know who it is.

The 100-minute running time zips by quickly.  There isn't a wasted moment in the entire film.  The flashback scenes are well-crafted and non-gimmicky.  The characters are real.  And the dialogue is quite clear -- glad to be able to leave the subtitles OFF (unlike ""Red Riding Trilogy,"" also starring Garfield).

First he amazed me in The Social Network and now just watching Boy A, he's a talent to watch and keep your eyes on. He also looks a bit like my younger brother (but that's for another time).

While this movie isn't a feel good movie per se...it's still gripping, funny at times (see the club see where Garfields character is high on E) and moving/emotional. It's also brutally honest, which you don't often see in films these days, except independent ones like this. I also loved the ending (which I won't give away...) but much like the hollywood blockbuster ending to ""Inception""...Boy A ends the same way, and allows you the viewer to make up your own mind as to how the boy's life ends up, because it's not spoon fed and wrapped in a bow for you.

3509404,4,B001CDFY6Y,"Boy A is diabolically affecting, and its societal dictum is as strong and significant as any in cinema over the last few years.

You may not know the name Andrew Garfield, but that's irrelevant. You will. At age 26 and with a couple studio titles to his rsum (Lions for Lambs, The Other Boleyn Girl), he has attained a level of dramatic portrayal that takes some a lifetime and escapes others completely. The vessel for this breakout is director John Crowley's Boy A, the deeply tragic story of a rehabilitated ex-convict (Garfield)--dubbed ""Boy A"" in his juvenile case. Boy A is forced into leading a hidden life to protect himself from the social discrepancies that would otherwise hinder, maybe even destroy his chance at normality, success, and happiness.

As Crowley's second feature film (his first was 2003's Intermission, starring Colin Farrell and Cillian Murphy), Boy A is astoundingly salient and equally persuasive, as are the actors, who improve its status from great to essential. But even before the force of its thespians hits, the film wins with the vitality of its writing and, specifically, the point it's set on hitting, which is best got at in its promotional tagline: ""Who decides who gets a second chance?"" The viewer is left to summon his or her own conclusion--perhaps the most distinguishably mature act of Crowley's adaptation--though it surely won't be considered an easy one, for the character that Garfield creates is so lushly endearing in his coyness and nervousness that the picture's audience will have a near-impossible time believing he ever had involvement in the heavy crime he's charged with.

And that's the brilliance of Boy A (and Andrew Garfield's role). Is the movie's focal study reformed or was he ever a monster to begin with? The provocation of such a topic is consuming, and John Crowley constructs the film in a way that maximizes its power, which is no less than shattering in its totality. Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell, Boy is a regimented political and social voice--willed by the demand of today's society--that adheres to the world's paradoxes and contradictions and keeps screaming until they've been fixed and announced. It also happens to be one of the most heartbreaking films I've seen in a while. It made a mess out of me.",1266883200,2,2293,4.950649350649351

Andrew Garfield as Jack conveys his character's anguish as he struggles to lead a ""normal"" life, assisted by Terry, his social worker (Peter Mullan).

The close relationship between Terry and Jack is threatened by the arrival of Terry's emotionally disenfranchised son, Zeb (James Young).

Outstanding performances by Garfield and Taylor Doherty as the coldly vicious Philip Craig, Jack's juvenile co-accused, give the film a disturbing authenticity.

Andrew Garfield is most convincing in his portrayal of BOY A, and Peter Mullan gives another of his fine performances as the case worker who does all in his power to smooth the transition from prison to society for BOY A by helping him to a assume a new identity under a federal relocation program.

3509413,5,B001CDFY6Y,"BOY A is a film that moves the audience in ways few other films do.  Part of this is the subject matter, part the solid drama of the novel by Jonathan Trigell on which Mark O'Rowe based his brilliantly understated screenplay, part the sensitive direction by John Crowley, and in large part is the cast of remarkably fine actors who make this impossibly treacherous story credible.

'Boy A' refers to Eric Wilson (Alfie Owen) who was jailed for a crime with his friend with  whom he was associated as a youth.  He has been released from prison and under the guidance of his 'parole officer/advisor' Terry (Peter Mullan), the now young adult is renamed Jack Burridge (Andrew Garfield) to protect him from the public who still remember the heinous crime of which he was convicted: Terry warns Jack to tell no one his real identity.  Jack is assigned a new family and finds new friends in this strange world outside prison walls, but he is still haunted by the crime that changed his life.  How Jack relates to his first female relationship and survives the bigotry of his classmates and city folk and finds a way to hold onto life despite his childhood 'sins' forms the development of this story.

While the entire cast is excellent, Andrew Garfield's performance as the guilt ridden needy Eric/Jack is exemplary.  There are many issues this film deals with in addition to the trauma of starting life over after imprisonment, issues that are universal in nature and that probe our psyches for answers that are never easily resolved here.  It is a brilliant little film from the UK.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 08",1225065600,25,1623,4.760714285714286

I can't stress enough how watchable and interesting the concept is and how well-acted the parts are. I hate to be cheesy, but the movie will make you think.
