7971298,5,B00006L95A,"Hello, after reading the comments from the apparently misinformed other reviewers i just had to come and write my own mini-review, this series is television documentary series run on the discovery channel about specific types of ""ancient warriors"" the episodes that i have cover the celts, vikings, romans, egyptians, assyrians,  spartans and macedonians.  The series overall is excellent, well worth watching if your a history buff interested in ancient warfare, the other reviewers babbling about machine guns and skeletons are just very confused and must be reviewing the wrong product.

The series goes quite into depth about tactics, dress and leadership of the different armies with colorful re-enactments from the period, overall a good buy.",1146700800,5,748,5.48695652173913
7971299,4,B00006L95A,"I read the other reviews of Ancient Warriors and couldn't disagree more strongly.  Ancient Warriors is admittedly low-budget, but the action moves along throughout and there is more humor in here than in most action movies.  Richard Lynch is solid as always, but his son, played by Andy Mckenzie, gives an even stronger performance as a tortured, put-upon offspring trying to be bad enough to please his dad.  Michael Hartson was likeable as ""Crunch,"" and he and Iris Penyado played off each other well with their psychic powers.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more sexual tension between ""Crunch"" and the knockout babe Michelle Hunziker, but as it was the realtionship added to the movie without breaking up the flow.  For her part, Hunziker was so good looking she could have stood mute throughout the film and I would have been satisfied. If you've seen any of his other movies, you know that Franco Columbu isn't an actor, but director Walter Von Huene gets more out of him than in other performances.  If you think Franco is going to win an Oscar anytime this century, you need watch no further than about the fifth miute, where a wooden Franco barks out an emotionless ""Papa, Papa!"" when his dad is dying.  This line rates high on the unintentional comedy scale.  Still, Von Huene plays things out nicely during the whole film, gets a lot of laughs out of the script (which he co-wrote), and his helicopter explosion for a low-budget film was totally believable.  If you don't expect this to view like a $120 Million film, I think you will enjoy the action and humor of Ancient Warriors.  This is not the Citizen Kane of action movies, but if there is an Ancient Warriors 2, I will buy the DVD.",1123027200,3,1708,4.625827814569536
7971300,5,B00006L95A,"Unfortunately a number of people have placed bad reviews for a completely unrelated movie on this listing.  I gave it five stars to compensate for this, but honestly I would not have anything negative to say anyway (except perhaps that I wish the episodes where longer and that they made more of them).  All the episodes are masterfully crafted and engrossing.  The use of a singluar narrative following one character while overviewing their entire warrior culture was a great idea.  It personolizes otherwise abstract historical occasions and gives you a feeling for what it would have really been like.  A few episodes do stick out, such as ""The Spartans"" because it's simply such a great and inspiring story, and ""The Ninja"" (just because ninjas are so bloody cool).  I hate to be a boring cliche, but this series is indeed both educational and entertaining.  You won't be disappointed.",1116979200,8,889,4.966216216216216

Ancient Warriors was a documentary series that aired on TLC/Discovery a few years ago. It contained great information on warriors such as the janissaries, the assyrians, the roman legionaires, and more. This set appears to include the episodes for the following: The Huns, The Spartans, The Ninja, The Celts, The Sioux, The Sammurai, The Vikings, and The Zulu. That's 8 episodes in all. This isn't the whole series though as it noticabley is missing: The romans, The Assyrians, The monks of shoa lin, the goths, the janissaries, The Macedonians/Alexanders army, the knights templar, and several more that I cannot think of.

The series was very well shot and featured great information and dramatic naration. There was a lot of depth in a short time span I believe 30 min per episode. It really was fantastic for anyone interested in history, military history, or the people covered by the series. I LOVED it. There is a box set similar to this one available on VHS from the discovery channel store but it varies in the episodes contained. I own that one, and it contains: The huns, The  Shao Lin Monks, The Sammurai, The Goths, The Vikings, The Janissaries, The romans, The Spartans and the Macedonians. So while they share some episodes they both seem to offer ones the other doesnt have. I wish they'd release the WHOLE series as a DVD set!!

In short this is a rare and hard to find series that is FANTASTIC for anyone arm chair historians of all sorts. Teachers should note that they work well especially well in a classroom environment because they will likely catch the interest of students and are short yet very informative and accurate.",1108339200,21,1653,4.809859154929577
7971302,1,B00006L95A,"...because the ANCIENT WARRIORS have little to do in this truly terrible movie.  Former bodybuilder Franco Columbu has managed to make Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier.  His ""performance"" is one of the worst acting leads on celluloid.  He plays a mercenary whose father is killed during a botched operation.  A year later, he moans around the house about his father's death and volunteers at a school for retarded children, where his daughter is one of the students.  Under the inept direction of Walter von Huene, this poor young lass comes across as comical; whether she's truly retarded or not, the script doesn't seem to want to do anything but exploit her ""gift.""  Anyway, Columbu finds out that a local mining operation is really a covert operation for the making of chemical warfare, under the auspices of long time bad man Richard Lynch.  Lynch, who is usually a capable performer, spends most of his time coughing into a hanky, as he has some kind of mysterious disease that is going to kill him.  Enter the ""ancient warrior"" theme:  supposedly they have some magic potion that will cure him but it's buried somewhere deep in the mines.  His son, played by Andy Mackenzie, tries hard to be a Mike or Kirk Douglas clone but only manages to come across as badass and bad actor.  A chunky Daniel Baldwin plays Columbu's best friend and fellow mercenary who calls the boys (and girl) together to help Franco stop the nefarious Lynch and Mackenzie.  Iris Peynado looking like the latest release from a dog kennel plays the vixenish, somewhat asexual psychic who is aiding Lynch.  The movie moves at an incredibly lethargic pace, the fight scenes are staged very amateurishly and the whole thing is really an embarassment to all involved.  I don't think ancient warriors themselves could have saved this catastrophic misfire.",1106611200,2,1844,4.925566343042071
7971303,1,B00006L95A,"This film is poorly edited, the transfer to DVD is poor, and the actual picture is grainy - like they used cheap film to make it. The story is about a mercenary who is after another mercenary who killed his father; he is really bad because he is messing with chemical weapons and ancient European tombs (which explains the title).
Don't waste a minute watching this.",1089936000,3,366,4.5606060606060606
7971304,4,B00006L95A,"this was a very good dvd covering most aspects of ancient warriors and how they lived and fought mostly to survive in hard and tough times it was not over the top and very interesting
and covered some new ground i had not heard before.i would
recodemn this dvd to anyone intrested in ancient times and cultures.",1039996800,4,311,4.473684210526316
