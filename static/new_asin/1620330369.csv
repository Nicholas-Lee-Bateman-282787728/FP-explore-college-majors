7800469,5,1620330369,wonderful intro overview than  layed out the follow-him-thru the one point perspective  lesson  that was way above couple of other  dvds (from nyc library ) presentations.  havn't gottin' to 2-n-3 point perspective yet but just the 1-point lay out demo was worth the price.,1447804800,,273,5.113636363636363
7800470,5,1620330369,"This is an excellent addition to the library of any artist who wishes to master linear perspective. In an intelligent progression, Mr. Connors makes clear the fundamentals of perspective, and goes further with his advanced knowledge of the subject. Watching an expert on a DVD work through the issues of perspective while explaining them is an advantageous method when compared to learning from a book. Highly recommend to the beginner and advanced student.",1430179200,2,457,5.273972602739726
7800471,5,1620330369,"I own this DVD. Patrick Connors is a master at perspective. The instruction on the set of DVDs is thorough, well taught and perfect for someone that wants to know about perspective drawing in depth. The instructions are easy to follow and clearly stated. I highly recommend this guide to perspective.",1430006400,2,300,4.901960784313726

The work. The artist himself is good. I took this class in person and it was excellent.",1385856000,,128,4.375
7800473,3,1620330369,"This was a detailed 2 disc presentation and well done for the most part. However, I wish the camera views had been from the other direction on some of the close ups as Patrick's hand blocked our view several times at crucial points.  Also I was disappointed at times as it was difficult to follow his process wishing he had gone further or explained a few more basics more fully.  I am not sure I would recommend it, especially to a young player.  Other than that it was still educational.",1380931200,,489,4.411111111111111
7800474,4,1620330369,"Great tool for learning the art of ""Perspective Drawing"". Helps me to understabd my art class assignments. This product like a lot of my class books and DVDs I buy on Amazon. They are the sam as those in the College Book Store but usually cheaper on Amazon and Amazon does not run out of their merchandise and if something is out of stock Amazon assures it will be stocked immediately",1358553600,,384,4.422535211267606
