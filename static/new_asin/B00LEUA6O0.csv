6481424,5,B00LEUA6O0,Thank god he made this documentary so we could hear both sides of the story. The power/electric companies have dominated the story line on smart meters and grids across all news stations. Its nice to hear the other side and be able to make an informed decision.

6481427,5,B00LEUA6O0,"Excellent documentary about problems related to smartmeters!

There is a big issue when smartmeters are either flawed or not so secure plus the radiofrequencies.

The good news is that this kind of documentaries will help address these problems.

Also, hopefully as consumers we can become more educated and cognizant of potential problems.

Personally, I think the smartmeter problem will be solved given the attention that it has been given.

However, I highly urge everyone to be alert on new things to come. Just because it is new, it does not

mean that it is always better and that it will have no problems.

Finally, in terms of electricity, I think now is the time to use less electricity and finally start becoming electricity independent.

Time to install solar panels and use less energy~",1496880000,,799,4.954887218045113

6481430,5,B00LEUA6O0,"This is required viewing. Microwave radiation is not safe at all. Especially when it is accumulating in high concentrations like with smart meters, cell phones and WIFI enabled devices. Just say NO! Turn all your WIFI down if you insist that you must have it. No one needs it at 100% strength! Only a fool leaves their WIFI on and sits right next to it or has it in their lap in their home yet I see ignorant people harming themselves all the time because they were never informed of this and simply do not want to know because it scares them. America is becoming one stupid brainless yuppy society and this must change or the US will decline more rapidly than ever before. This documentary exposes the dangerous, incredibly unsafe RF exposure we are all exposed to daily without consent and how we are lied to about its safety profile constantly by the same companies selling us this technology. It goes so far as to show some of the dangerous effects on health, the invasions of privacy, the risk of hacking being great and likely, the huge billing rate increase associated with these devices and the corruption behind it all. If you want to see whom funds the bogus safety studies for these devices, watch this film. Their is a genuine conflict of interest in the corporate cabal that spies on and controls most of our lives covertly with propaganda they fund masquerading as legitimate safety studies and bogus ""green energy"" propaganda to support it and garner public support or at least public ignorance to the fact.

6481476,3,B00LEUA6O0,"This is a very alarming documentary about what radiation from so-called smart meters can do to your health and wealth. Its well presented, interesting and even entertaining. Fair and balanced? I don't know. Indeed, can there at this time be a fair and balanced take on this subject? I suggest the reader see this and make up his or her own mind, perhaps with a little added research.

As for my opinion, I think in the midst of so much misinformation, partial information, propaganda, paid lies, emotional lies, ignorance--especially ignorance since most people really know little to nothing about the effects of electromagnetic radiation on living tissues--we need to look at the broader picture and concentrate on what we know.

How can we know the truth? Im not sure we can. But how many smart meters are in operation throughout the world? That can be estimated to a fair accuracy. But how many people suffer ill-health or even death because of these meters? That is the problem: that number cannot be even estimated confidently. Why? Because a causal trail would have to be established from the meters to the ailing persons AND other possible causes would have to be eliminated.

So what do I think? My belief is that (1) some people may be more susceptible to EMRs than others, and (2) it may be the case that the electric companies have mistakenly in some cases installed meters that really are harmful to our health.

Probably the most frightening case given in the documentary is not about smart meters. It is about two faculty members and one student at San Diego State University getting brain cancer at a single location, Nasatir Hall on campus. Was this a cancer cluster caused by something on or near the site (the documentary points to a nearby High Performance Wireless Research Network Tower) or was it just a coincidence? One of the faculty members and a student died in 2008; the other faculty member died in 1993.

Okay, again what do I think? My belief is that a cancer cluster of three people 15 years apart (with no new cases since 2008) is probably a coincidence. Theres a whole world of science, pseudoscience and conjecture about cancer clusters that the reader might want to research. The problem is two-fold: probabilistically proving cause is extremely difficult, and even if there is no single cause there will be cancer clusters arising purely by chance.

As in many other aspects of the environment concerning our health the truth is very difficult to find because there will be research on both sides of any issue sponsored by people with a vested interest in one side or the other.

However, just as with tobacco and climate change, eventually the truth will out. I am waiting. Meanwhile I am pleased that there is no smart meter on my home, although if there were I don't think I would worry about it. But maybe I would do more research and then maybe I would worry. Maybe not.

Life is complicated and although I think this documentary is a bit over the top I think it is worth watching. In a way its a good place to begin your research if you are worried about how electrical magnetic radiation may affect our health.

I happened to a couple of months ago and to my surprise there it was...a new ""smart"" meter.  As far as I can tell I was not personally made privy to the fact this would happen at my residence so it was a bit of a surprise though I imagined that every so often it was normal for meters to be replaced due to various factors.  The fact it was of this new smart ilk though did get me thinking since I had accidentally heard some folks on some talk radio shows say these are unhealthy and invasive of ones privacy.  Because talk radio has a healthy slice of conspiracy type zealots I, basically, just made a mental note and not much else.  Seeing one at you own home is a ""game-changer"" though.  You might want to check your own home and if you want to know more then I strongly suggest you watch this excellent film.  It addresses both the health and privacy issues of the new wireless RF meters that are appearing everywhere (my town is less than 20,000 in population).

The film itself is what I'd call an ""eye-opener"".  It deals not in conspiracy but the somewhat hidden real science questioning the safety of these devices.  You will also meet real people who have had instances of health and other problems in their wishes to exercise their rights not to have one of these questionable meters attached to their home.  You also see potential other downsides such as a notable number of fires when these meters overheat.  Fires that have destroyed property and, perhaps, due to no loss of life due fires yet have been claimed as safe even as this is a known problem.  Taking Back Your Power may seem like it's on an agenda, but it unfolds more like a strongly validated cautionary expose'.  One your utility company would hope you'd never see.

So, how did this happen under our noses?  Well, the Obama administration made 200-billion dollars available to utilities to implement this system.  That's your money by the way.  Were you contacted by your representatives in Congress for your opinion?  Of course not because just like invasive cell phone tower radiation it was much bigger than you.  Speaking of cell phone tower radiation, this is touched on here too and it is one of the biggest health risks that surrounds the general populace as shown here.  Even if you don't believe any of this you might just open your mind if you give this a watch.  It's that good and that important.  I'd say the potential harm is so well exposed that even a nay-sayer may just begin to think about the potential harm.  See it and have all your friends to also and then Take Back Your Power.",1446854400,6,2663,4.463768115942029

6481522,1,B00LEUA6O0,"This ""documentary"" is entirely unscientific. None of it is supportable. These are the FACTS:

- The television set that you watched this movie on has a switching mode power supply that emits 10,000 times as much electromagnetic energy as your smart power meter,
- Your compact disc machine that was spinning the Compact or Blu-Ray disc that you were watching has a switching mode power supply that emits 1,000 times as much electromagnetic energy as your smart meter,
- The wireless broadband transmitter that was sending the wireless signal to your laptop or tablet computer was broadcasting a microwave signal that was 100 times as powerful as your smart meter,

I'm just getting started.

Your range top in your kitchen emits more than 1,000,000 times (that's not a typo, one million times) the microwave radiation of your smart electric meter.

Ever wonder why they don't sell ""microwave oven leak detectors"" anymore? People were returning them to the stores saying they were malfunctioning because they were ""pegged"" when pointed at electric stovetop burners, hair dryers, and out the window onto the street. Fact is, they were working perfectly. All of those items emit microwave energy that is hundreds to millions of times what a microwave oven does.

Your handheld hair dryer emits more than 1,000,000 times the microwave radiation of your smart meter; and you hold it pointed directly at your head for several minutes every morning after you get out of your shower.

And the biggest microwave radiation emitter on the face of the earth (literally, on the face of the earth) is the asphalt road that runs in front of your home.

When you see the ""heat wave"" rising from the street in front of your house on a summer day, that heat wave is 100% microwave radiation at an intensity that heats your entire body from the inside out. Can your ""smart"" electric meter do that?.

Those are the scientific facts. No discussion, no proof, no argument. That ship has already sailed, those trains have already left the station. Those are the facts. All you have to do to verify these facts are go to your local High School and ask the Physics teacher to show you the chart she/he has on the wall of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. Then ask him/her to explain to you something thermodynamics people call, ""Black Body Radiation"".

That black asphalt in front of your house is being heated by the sun and photons are being absorbed and ""re-emitted"" from the asphalt. That high school physics teacher will tell you that is ""black body radiation"". He/she will also tell you all of it is in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. We are talking MILLIONS of watts of radiated microwave power. The person who wrote, directed, produced this ""documentary"" knows none of these facts.

The writer, producer, director is trying to convince you that millionths of a watt (microwatts) from a Smart Power Meter is killing you, while he forgets to mention the megawatts of microwave energy you are exposed to crossing a black asphalt street on a sunny summer day.

This movie is fear mongering of the most despicable kind.

I have a ""smart meter"" on my house. I have ""smart meters"" on my rental property houses. Nobody in any neighborhood I own property in has had a house burn down. Nobody; from any cause. Period.  His ""proof"" that ""smart meters"" cause house fires is an anecdotal report from a phone call that wasn't recorded to a person who isn't named. His interview of a person whose ""house"" (?) burned down was an interview of someone whose ""house"" was in such poor / substandard condition that there is a greater likelihood that the owner set fire to that structure in order to collect the insurance money. The easiest ""person"" to blame was PG&E; so that's exactly what the owner did.

My ""time of use"" payment plan means that I can run my air conditioner all night long for FREE. That's right, TXU has a free nights plan that allows me to use my dishwasher, air conditioner, clothes washer, and almost every big energy consumer at night for FREE. Currently, I pay an average cost for my electricity of $0.082 per kilowatt hour of service. That's lower than anybody else in my neighborhood pays. How do I do it? All of my appliances have a ""Delay Start"" feature that allows me to program them to start automatically after the free nights kick in. And I have a programmable thermostat that has the air conditioner run all night long.

None of this would be possible without my SMART METER. Take back my power? I've already done that!",1440460800,12,4533,4.771392081736909

I couldn't understand why I could fall asleep on my living room couch with the TV going, wake up and then go to to bedroom, only to come wide awake in the bedroom.  The movie was showing locally in March. Before I went to the movie, I called my local electric company and asked if I had a smart meter.  The answer was that one had been installed in 2010.  I asked for it to be removed and replaced with an analog meter.  Before it was removed I had a guy come in and test the EMFs.  The differences in the EMF readings before and after the meter was removed were significant.  No wonder I couldn't sleep in my own bedroom.

8665445,1,B00LEUA6O0,"Talk about junk science.  Sure RF energy at the levels a radar station generates at a few feet from the horn have an impact on the human body, but that's billions to trillions of times what a smart meter on the other side of your utility room wall is doing to you in your bedroom 30 feet away.  These meters do not generate any more RF energy than the wifi you're possibly using to watch the movie over and odds are the meter is further away from you.  Odds are good that the power supply in your TV delivers as much RF energy to you as these meters.  The privacy concerns are a bigger issue though don't yet tell anyone as much as is implied here.  Smart appliances may eventually go too far but so far they're not talking to your meter (yet.)  All the information these meters have so far is the size of the load that is being turned on or off, that means they can tell when your fridge or AC runs and at most can tell if someone likely to be home or not or if everyone is asleep or not.  The cyber security issue is barely touched on and is is probably the most major concern.  Even with today's limited ability to control devices in the house, a hacked smart meter could turn off all the power, then eventually turn a large number of people's meters on at the same instant to take down the electric grid with the huge surge in demand.",1500595200,,1338,4.158914728682171

It was informative and interesting, and I liked that at the end, it had a constructive message about what we can do to take back our power.

However, it's not a perfect film.
