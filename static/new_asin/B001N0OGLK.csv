8322786,5,B001N0OGLK,"I saw the Annie Moses Band on public television during the Christmas season - I was truly amazed at their skill - especially the young folks in this family. Their parents did a fantistic job of guiding each one where their natural giftings were so as to enable them to flourish. The father has a background in jazz and the mother has a vocal performance degree. Their unique fusion of jazz, classical, blue grass and gospel is a delightful blend that truly is the Annie Moses Band signiture sound! I highly recommend this album... it's very wholesome to listen to.",1262995200,4,564,4.65
