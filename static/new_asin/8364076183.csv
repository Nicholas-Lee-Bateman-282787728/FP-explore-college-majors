But it hasn't really, not completely, not for the 150 million living in Soviet occupied countries. The truths of WW2 were available for study by Americans and western Europeans for 75 years now. But not the Poles. WW2 did not end in 1945, that was just when the Americans and British Commonwealth forces achieved their security and stopped fighting. WW2 for the Poles did not end until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 and when their occupying armies vacated Poland.  The film is hard to watch as it so brutal. But it is a must.",1515974400,,704,4.415384615384616

7900964,4,8364076183,"I learned about ""Miasto 44"" and the work of Jan Komasa on DW.DE tv. I was intrigued and wanted to see this movie. I ordered it via Amazon. First, the ""bad""... This is a DVD from Europe, so it is set up as ""region 2""; my DVD/Blueray player would not play. I expected this and resorted to ""Plan B""; I used the basic DVD player in my home computer and change its region from 1 to 2, and left my primary DVD drive as my primary drive set to 1, so no issues there. The package for the disc is well done, kind of like a small and and narrow hardcover book; unfortunately it is printed in Polish... It is subtitled, so you have to pay attention!

Now the ""Good"": I do agree with some other reviews that this movie and its producer fell victim to a Hollywood driven ""me too"" use of special effects. Some of the special effects certainly did not positively add to the narrative of the movie. That said, there were a number of individual scenes that were highly compelling and made watching this movie well worth the technical issues and price. I would have preferred SFX and production style more like those of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"", but the story is compelling on its own merits regardless of visual style. As an Army veteran and a fan of WWII movies, I highly recommend ""Miasto 44"".",1439078400,2,1297,4.337448559670782
7900965,3,8364076183,"There are three classic cinema masterpieces dealing with cities rising in insurrection - , Andrej Wajda's ""Kanal""(1956) , ""Is Paris Burning"" (1966) and ""The Battle of Algiers"" (1964).

Kanal, like Miasto '44, dealt with the Warsaw Rising against the German occupiers.  Kanal had the advantage of being made little more than a decade after the event, but was tightly constrained by the politics of Communist Poland.  I had seen some previews of Miasto '44 and read that the Warsaw Rising Museum had given its full resources to aid the authenticity of the production. What was the result?

Well, technically, the production seems to have made enormous efforts to recreate Warsaw in 1944 - the recreation of whole blocks of period streetscapes, vehicles, dress, uniforms and military equipment is faultless - even the recreation of replicas of German combat vehicles used in the battle, and the characters look, if not emaciated, certainly like an underfed population living under the privations of very hostile occupiers.....but...but.........Well, the film has a near total absence of historical, social, political and military context - the battle lasted two months - but there isn't a clue here as to the passage of time, and that is because the movie is almost more a love story for the MTV generation.

Parts of the film resemble high quality music clips (even to including the pop muzack) that abruptly sweep from harrowing battles to surreal images of passionate, naked lovemaking by the main protagonists in the midst of the fighting, or a girl dancing around glowing streams of tracer to more pop music.  There are some jarring scenes in the first half hour too - the young lovers, Stefan and Alice going out to a riverside party at night in a  private car. ....Did not the Germans have a curfew..or evening lighting restrictions, was there not petrol rationing......elsewhere in German occupied Europe private citizens who still had motor vehicles made use of clumsy coal and charcoal gas arrangements (a feature re-created in ""Is Paris Burning"") but not here...and then they stand on the edge of the river watching the explosive lightshow of the frontline....even though that would have been a restricted German security zone....Maybe this is how the producers think Generation Y take their history - beautiful, photogenic youth partying in the carnage...but is that really what this movie is all about?

Sure, maybe a historical docudrama, something along the lines of ""Is Paris Burning""  would be too bleak - especially in the case of the Warsaw Rising.  Unlike Paris '44, there was no glorious liberation, or willing allies advancing to the rescue.  The Allied forces to the East, across the Vistula River, were the Red Army -  who only three years previously, were allies of Nazi Germany, and who had orchestrated their own attack on Poland in coordination with the 1939 German invasion, murdering or deporting thousands of Poles in the Russian zone of occupation until the Germans turned on them in June 1941.......Hell......The Soviets and Germans actually held a joint victory Parade through conquered Warsaw in 1939.  Given this background, the Red Army was not exactly the golden hope of liberation in 1944........

The Germans destroyed the city, killed 200,000 inhabitants amidst scenes of torture and rape, and deported the survivors......and the few Polish resistance fighters who made it across the Vistula to Soviet forces were treated, in nauseating hypocrisy, like enemies - shot out of hand, or arrested and sent to Soviet Concentration Camps in Russia.........but you wouldn't know any of this from the movie...although there are scenes of destructive bloodshed aplenty.

I understand that some elderly Polish veterans and survivors of the Uprising were outraged when they saw Miasto '44 - a movie with such high physical production values that wasted an opportunity to entertain (if that's the right word) AND educate a young modern audience.  I wonder what a non-Polish audience would think - assuming an open mind in wanting to view this movie...?",1427500800,3,4078,5.165402124430956
7900966,3,8364076183,"Sadly, Miasto 44 takes Polish cinema into Hollywood's lair.  The film has a lot of fine action scenes (although maybe a couple too many of those high octane computerized action sequences that get created in postproduction), and it also has a curious three-sided romance.  But, unfortunately, it tells us very little about the complicated nature of the Rising itself.

Since the film was produced by the highly-acclaimed Warsaw Uprising Museum, I thought that we would learn much more about the historical context of the uprising:  about the ambivalence of the government-in-exile (and Sosnkowski) in London; about the overall strategy of the Armia Krajowa (and Bor-Komorowski) in Warsaw;  about the extent to which they expected (or didn't) help from the Soviets and the Allies; and lastly, an overarching war room sense of the balance of forces, military tactics, troop movements, strongholds, turning point, etc..

[SPOILER ALERT IN THIS PARAGRAPH] Instead we were treated to a series of well-done, and exceptionally  graphic, battle scenes in a couple of the city's sectors (along with scenes of overcrowded hospitals, apartment hallway skirmishes, unsafe basement hideouts, etc.), and a quirky romantic triangle.  Illustrative of the action-packed Hollywood slant is a scene in which a German tank rumbles to a stop in the Warszawian rubble; slowly, the Panther's turret turns and lowers the barrel of its 75mm cannon directly at one of the pretty romantic leads and blasts her to smithereens, but then, miraculously, she remains sufficiently alive to give an important tip to her lover before she dies.

The Uprising was, of course, a tragic failure, but the complex rationale behind its instigation seems undisputedly tenable.  The Polish fighters were brave, courageous, and heroic, but the carnage (ca. 180,000 civilians massacred, ca. 16,000 AK soldiers killed, along with the absolute destruction of Poland's capital city, not to mention the ca. 17,000 professional Nazi soldiers killed, wounded or missing) was catastrophic .  In addition to the blistering portrayal of devastating street battles (and romantic entanglements)--that could just as easily (with different uniforms and other languages) been transported (except for the sewers) to other film-worthy locales (e.g., Stalingrad, or Budapest, or Sarajevo)--I would like to have seen a broader probe into the political and strategic nature of the complicated gamble that the 1944 uprising in Warsaw actually was.  In other words, I would have liked to to have seen cinema verite as distinctly, and uniquely Polish as: ""In Darkness,"" or ""General Nil,"" or ""Jack Strong.""",1426636800,5,2636,5.4338235294117645
7900967,5,8364076183,"I watched this film last night.  The images still linger.  There are films you see and don't forget.  For me this is one of them.  Initially I was wary of the love story angle, but then I wonder how else could the hell that was the inferno of the two month long Warsaw Uprising of 1944 be portrayed in a feature length movie.  Two young people, so typical of the insurgents who fought and died in this very bloody conflict, fall hopeless in love, as only the young can.  They are separated as the Warsaw Uprising is prolonged and eventually find each other as they participate in the bloody heroic struggle.  The ending was a surprise and memorable in how it symbolically portrays a city which refuses to die.

For those who want a lengthy dramatisation of the Warsaw Uprising they should view the 13 episodes of 'Days of Honour' Season 7.  That is also an excellent production about the Warsaw Uprising most WW11 historians tend to ignore, and consequently most non Poles, or those of Polish descent like me, know little if anything about.",1425600000,7,1040,4.578378378378378

7900969,5,8364076183,"One thing I really don't like in films are kitsch Hollywood type of endings or exaggerated scene (e.g. main character kisses his love interest for the first time while bullets fly all around them and explosions burst through-out yet they stay unhindered).  I could name multiple examples from this film that are similar in aspect, but I am not here to bash this huge Polish production from 2014.  Miasto 44 (Warsaw 44') was produced and released for the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, which took place in August of 1944, and lasted for two months. This historical event should not be confused with the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from 1943.  But I am not here to talk about the historical significance of this devastating and at the same time heroic event in the Polish history.  There are plenty of books that have been written about Warsaw Uprising and even world's first featured documentary film assembled from original footage that was shot during the fighting called Powstanie Warszawskie (Warsaw Uprising) in color and with commentary, and also from 2014.  One last thing I would like to say about the Warsaw Uprising, is that it was one of the most bloodiest uprisings of the entire WW II conflict, if not the bloodiest, within a two month period close to 200,000 Warsaw citizens lost their lives not to mention Polish Resistance fighters (who were mostly composed of young people, sometimes even teenagers and kids), while another 700,000 were expelled from the city.  On Hitler's orders the city itself was leveled to the ground in early October of 1944.

Getting back to the film itself...this is a 130 minute long story of Stefan, a young and nave Polish teenager who gets pulled into the Polish Underground Resistance organization by his neighbor, who happens to be a girl his age, nicknamed Kama.  Kama is secretly in love with Stefan, however Stefan is more concerned with his family (widow mother and younger brother) and with the talk on the streets of the upcoming uprising.  Kama quickly introduces Stefan to the Polish resistance organization (they are women and men his age).  One beautiful summer day right before the outbreak of the uprising, Stefan meets Alice a.k.a. Biedronka (Ladybug), younger sister of one of the resistance fighters. They meet on the bank of the near by river Wisla, and their first encounter will make them fall crazy in love with each other.  The love triangle between Stefan, Biedronka, and Kama will be the epicenter of this melodramatic war movie.  However, only one of the girls will go the extra length to be with Stefan.  The ending of the movie, or rather the final scene is left to viewers own interpretation.

About the special effects and production.  The film contains some first class special effects sequences.
The scenes of urban warfare, explosions, German soldiers speaking German language (actual German actors), characterizations, large number of extras,--- it all reminded me of Saving Private Ryan (1998) or the Downfall (2004).  The music in this film has both the old pre-war Polish classics, and contemporary instrumental music that can be heard in scenes involving love making or close combat charging, both of which are captured in slow motion.

In conclusion, this is not Wajda's classic Kanal (1956) nor Rossellini's Germany, Year Zero (1948).  But a worthy of recommendation WW II drama, even if it is kitschy and clich at moments it is still an entertaining piece of film-making...with a strong anti-war message.

One last thing, you are more likely to shed a tear or two...watching these young people getting shot, blown to pieces, set on fire, committing suicide, loving and dying in a spare of the moment will most likely leave you in shock...",1423180800,7,3728,4.964630225080386
