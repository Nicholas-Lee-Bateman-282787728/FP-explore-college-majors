7906198,2,B00000F0FJ,"This video looks like it was thrown together in 2 minutes. The opining music dosen't sound at all like Godzilla music. How many times can you use the same picture of Willis O'Brien. 4 times to be exact. It's like theres  no other pictures availible. Alot of the information in this movie is  toatally wrong! The only thing that saves this tape is that is has the  original ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" trailer that I have never seen.  It's like a monster movie documentrey for pre-schoolers. ""Was Godzilla  the first monster movie ever made?"". What a stupid question!",953856000,9,561,4.742268041237113
