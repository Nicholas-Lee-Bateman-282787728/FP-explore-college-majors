2206634,5,B00079HZSY,This movie is worth watching. It gives you a glimpse into true humanity through a day in the life of a Chicago cab driver.,1185321600,,122,4.125
2206635,5,B00079HZSY,"Will Kern's ""Hellcab"" is an excellent play by a talented writer, and like many stage productions, a risky transfer for the big screen, but the list of executive producers alone would indicate that several money-players in Hollywood felt the story was worth the effort. Is the movie up to the standards of the play? Probably not, but it is still a damn good film and perfect for those cerebral evenings where action and physical comedy take a backseat to highly literate cinematic entertainment.",1155945600,3,494,4.963855421686747
2206636,5,B00079HZSY,"Not to disagree with others on this terrific film, I believe that the producers and directors of this fine art film got it just right. To those people who take cabbies for granted and beleive that their lives are just boring non-descriptive airheads aimlessly driving through the streets of doom, simply waiting for that maniac to get into their cab and shoot, cut or mame them for life, this is a true to life glimpse of the way things really are for the drivers. Their real thoughts, dangers and anxieties are right on. Take it from someone who really knows about what it is like to drive a hack for a living and although this film is a little dark, that is how life is for cabbies. A little dark. Like my other favorite cabbie film, 'Driven', not to be confused with the Stallone movie, this movie shows the frustration of people dumping their problems on the driver as well as prying into his business and the constant fruitless efforts to help or 'not to help' some of the passengers, not to mention the true and real dangers. I found this movie to be as close to a day in a cabbies life as you can get with maybe the exception of even more drama. There is only so much that you can capture in a couple of hours. For anyone who ever thought about driving a cab or what it must be like, this is a drivers guide. Not pretty, but truthful. Paul Dillon as the main cast 'driver' has cleverly captured the demeanor, frustration, fear and comedy of a day in a cabbies life. Smart casting of smaller parts and cameo's by Michael Ironside, Laurie Metcalf, John C. Reilly, Gillian Anderson, John Cusack and Jullian Moore add to the experience. Although this movie was originally made a few years back and under another name 'Chicago Cab' I was pleased to find that the producers went back to the original title. John Cusack also, an executive producer of this movie plays a perfect villan near the end of the film. Well worth the fare!",1122422400,,1931,4.44225352112676
2206637,5,B00079HZSY,We agree with Ian. This was a great movie with some very intense moments. We thought it was a shame that thy gave it this idiotic name. It propbably would have had a wider audience.,1116806400,,181,4.2
2206638,2,B00079HZSY,"Don't be misled by the title, cover art, or log line: ""Dare You Pay The Fare?"" HELLCAB is not a horror film.

HELLCAB is a boring art film (and normally, I love indie/art films). It's about the depressing day in the life of a Chicago cabby. Each passenger gets one or two minutes of screen time, including ""star"" Gillian Anderson, who struggles with an Italian blue-collar accent.

Film is a series of vingettes; nothing is ever resolved. We see the passenger, their situation set up, then go on to the next passenger.  I kept waiting for a story to gel, but there is no story.  And no point other than: see how depressing this guy's life is?  Yes, it is.  This is not a pleasant or fun film to watch.  Nor is it engaging or involving.  We feel sorry of the cabbie, but don't particularly like (or dislike) him.

HELLCAB has a few strong moments (the rape victim, the architect, the sleazeball played by the always talented John C. Reilly) but not enough to make this cab ride worth it.

According to the credits, HELLCAB was based on a play.  I suppose they put some chairs on stage with the actor in the driver's seat, and other actors coming in and out.

A much better film about cabbies is DRIVEN (not to be confused with the Sly Stallone film of the same name).  DRIVEN has its depressing moments, but it has fully fleshed, memorable characters, with interesting story arcs.

Curiously, both HELLCAB and DRIVEN occur around Christmas time, and use that to contrast the cabbies' depressed lives with the joyous yuletide lights.",1116633600,5,1531,4.580882352941177
2206639,4,B00079HZSY,"Although the packaging says it is fullscreen, the film is presented in a letterbox format.  Aside from the cabbie, everyone else (Julianne Moore, John Cusack, Gillian Anderson, etc.) appears for only minutes as they take a ride through Chicago. Originally titled Chicago Cab.",1114905600,,275,5.395348837209302
8046291,1,B00079HZSY,"I bought this movie because I am a huge fan of Gillian Anderson. Well, I come to find out she was literally in the movie for 3:56. YUP THATS IT. The package was perfect on arrival, but seriously, this movie was not that good. I only enjoyed the short amount of time listed above. They should have not made it seem as though these actresses/actors were in it for longer than 5 minutes.",1481328000,,384,4.273972602739726
8046292,5,B00079HZSY,I love this movie especially the actor Paul Dillon. He's awesome. Highly recommended.,1474588800,,85,5.615384615384615
8046293,5,B00079HZSY,Yeah ....takes me back in the drivers set..With a lot of abuse from passengers..Good luck TNC drivers..,1446681600,,103,5.117647058823529
8046294,5,B00079HZSY,Best-scripted taxi film I have viewed. Drove taxi for 30-plus years in San Francisco.,1416873600,,85,5.142857142857143
8046295,5,B00079HZSY,"Hellcab (Mary Cybulski and John Tintori, 1997)
[originally posted 22Feb2000]

Rent. Go rent now. Also known as ""Chicago Cab,"" and based on the play of that name, Hellcab is one of those flicks that follows around a cab driver (Paul Dillon, a fantastic actor who looks like Flea, sounds like Flea two octaves lower, is as well-cast as Flea in the highly-underrated Dudes... well, you get the idea) as he picks up fares and wanders in and out of the lives of the passengers. Tight, funny, high-pitched. Small parts from Gillian Anderson, John Cusack (also one of the film's producers), and best actress 2000 nominee Julianne Moore in the kind of scene that makes us realize why she could be nominated for best actress. I mean, she's GOOD. My video store has this under horror, no matter how much I try to get them to change it. It ain't. Comedy/drama, and damn good comedy/drama at that. **** ",1377043200,,891,4.6687898089171975
8046296,3,B00079HZSY,"The name makes it sound like a supernatural thriller. It is not. This is a stage play converted to a film. It's a film about a guy working as a cabbie having a bad day.

At first, I almost stopped watching it because I thought it was about his passengers. They just are not all that unusual really. They are just people caught up in their own lives and it is not pretty. What makes it interesting is that it gets to him. He is not immune or numb to it.

It's about how he feels and his situation. It's kind of subtle and not a standard Hollywood product. I am glad I saw it.

This film is advertised as ""Starring Gillian Anderson, Laurie Metcalf and John Cusack"". That is a lie. It stars Paul Dillon. There are a few scenes in which some well-known stars appear.",1347148800,,762,4.170068027210885
8046297,3,B00079HZSY,"I just saw this film in a pile of other unknown dvds at a liquidation store. It sounds like a horror film in the vein of Bone Collector. However, this is far from what you'd expect. It's about a taxi driver who picks up various people, most of them are Hollywood stars, and they talk about problems. It's not a bad movie and it's well acted but I wish they would have choosen a different title for the movie. They also say it takes on one day which is the longest of the year but it seems days pass before the movie ends. A minor problem but it is worth watching at least once.",1260921600,,577,4.0701754385964914
8046298,4,B00079HZSY,"An admirer of John Cusack, am collecting all of his films. This is a darkly humorous look at the adventures of a cab driver. Cusack's bit was great, but too short.",1254614400,,163,4.290322580645161
8046299,5,B00079HZSY,"I reviewed this one before I think. I have never been to a city, in traffic, or in a cab. The people were interesting, and that was really fun to see what it is like to ride around in a cab in a city. That was great.",1223337600,,216,3.617021276595745
8046300,4,B00079HZSY,"This is the way it is--and we know that. Film consists of a series of vignettes--as it should, because that's the cab business, the way it is for any cabbie: people get in, people get out--and most you never see again (if you're a cab driver in any big city.)
And yet, this is what hurts the movie. The actors are not to blame, because this is one amazing cast; neither are the directors (there were two; it was co-directed) it comes down to the writing.

The reason Scorcese's Taxi Driver works as well as it does (for the most part) is because the DeNero character did a lot more than just drive around New York dealing with abnoxiius and/or insane fares; there was an actual storyline that went somewhere and took the audiance along for the duration of the ride.",1214956800,3,765,4.425531914893617
