8610112,4,B00EWNJKBQ,Most of the time when you get a two movie Christmas set one is good and the other a dog.  This time though you get two entertaining films.  Ebbie's Story is a modern day Scrooge tale with Susan Lucci taking the brunt of the three ghosts to change her way of life.  On The Second Day Of Christmas you get a romantic story of Mark Ruffalo as a security guard having two deal with a pickpocket duo made up of a attractive aunt and a adorable little girl.  Good pairing.,1419120000,,466,4.144444444444445
