2856864,1,B000R2GV7M,Terrible. Purchased thinking it was going to be full of out takes.  It's more of a terrible knockoff version of the real movie.,1386806400,7,127,4.521739130434782
2856865,5,B000R2GV7M,"what else do you need to know?  anything ron burgundy is wonderful!!!  it's not another full length film or anything like that, but it does have stuff unseen in the original and i thought it was totally worth the price (i'm  a big fan, so take that into consideration).

FOR HUGE FANS ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1376611200,3,303,4.660377358490566
2856866,3,B000R2GV7M,"It's totally on YouTube.  Just search for it and you can watch it online.  It was a funny movie, but I certainly wouldn't be obliged to pay for it since somebody has already uploaded the entire thing online.",1372204800,5,207,4.421052631578948
2856867,3,B000R2GV7M,"This is basically the footage that is played in the edited version of the movie that plays on TV, plus any all footage they shot, good or bad.  If you love this movie, you might enjoy some of this one.",1358812800,,201,4.025
2856868,5,B000R2GV7M,"All the lost and unused footage from the original, made into another full-length movie. It definitely has it's rocky moments, but not too bad considering how they pulled this together.",1355097600,2,184,5.166666666666667
2856869,1,B000R2GV7M,"Dont get confused, this isn't a sequel to the movie ""Anchorman"" which was one of Will Farrell's best movies. All this movie is every deleted scene from the original movie put together like a movie.

Director Adam McKay has a habit of making enough deleted scenes with sub plots to make a full lengh movie.

In the original, there were 2 planned main plots, a Panda giving birth along and Veronica/Ron situation. Then there is the unused plot of a group of Bank thieves called the ""Alarm Clock"". There were a ton of deleted scenes to go along with the plot and some even cancelled out other scenes in the movie if they had gone with that plot.

It could have been a good movie, but the movie felt more like watching the deleted scenes. There were no transition into some scenes. Heck most of the scenes were deleted parts of a scene in the original.

The plot is told to be after the first and yet the scenes tell you otherwise...that its the same movie but with different scenes. Same plot as the original.

-Ron is the #1 anchor in San Diego
-Veronica starts as a small reporter and gets to do the news
-They hate and then love each other
-Ron does something to get fired and looks like a bum
-All this while a plot is going on

In the begining we learn Veronica is out of town at an award show as an anchor but really its deleted scenes setting up for her first appearance.

This movie had potental but it wasn't that all good. Watch it if you must

Pros:
-A somewhat new storyline

Cons:
-Actually felt like watching deleted scenes
-A lot of factoral errors, claiming some scenes happened much later then they actually are
-Basically its the same movie as the original but with different scenes
-Most of the scenes are deleted parts from the original",1295308800,13,1753,4.402476780185759

2856871,5,B000R2GV7M,"Right off the bat, I will say, if you don't or didn't enjoy Anchorman, don't see this. If you do have a soul however, this might be the greatest movie known to man. It has all the extremely funny humor of Anchorman, but it is 100% less popular. This means that unfunny people who quote movies all the time (like Napolean Dynomite) cannot and have not ruined this movie (like Napolean Dynomite). I personally think it is more funny and much more random than the first. In conclusion, this is (in my opinion) Will Ferrell's greatest and funniest film ever.",1198972800,34,554,4.55
2856872,1,B000R2GV7M,"Absolutely terrible, patched together using deleted scenes. Those scenes were deleted for a reason - they were not funny and completely sucked. I cannot describe how utterly disappointed I was in this collection of floor leavings they scraped together to capitalize on the popularity of the original ""Anchorman."" It lacks all of the panache of the first movie.",1425859200,,360,5.224137931034483
2856873,5,B000R2GV7M,"Yes, it does have a few scenes from the original but not that many.  It's the outtakes and unused footage which they put together to make this movie.  I enjoyed it.  The original is a classic so of course some people may not like it.  But for die-hard fans, I think you'll find something to love about this movie.  I thought it was funny!",1400803200,2,338,4.21875
2856874,5,B000R2GV7M,Awesome movie.  The supporting cast is wonderful and Ferrell is hilarious.  I love Steve Carell in this movie.  Sometimes I think he shines more in a supporting role than as the lead.,1397606400,,183,4.65625

2856878,1,B000R2GV7M,This movie was all of the dumb outtakes that they were smart enough NOT to put in the original movie.  It was a waste of the 1 1/2 hours to watch it.  Boo.,1388448000,,155,3.6666666666666665
2856879,1,B000R2GV7M,"Slapped together from deleted scenes. Not funny or entertaining.  This belongs as a free extra on a DVD version, not worth the $.",1388275200,2,129,4.608695652173913
2856880,3,B000R2GV7M,It's was a fun movie but has lots of the same scenes from the original. Fun if ur a big fan!,1388188800,,92,3.4285714285714284
2856881,1,B000R2GV7M,"In the interest of full disclosure, I am not a fan of Will Ferell.
I do not understand WHY he is allowed to continue making movies.

The script does not serve his particular type of humor. There appears to be little or no ""Direction"" to reign in Ferells' excesses. The humor feels very forced and contrived, and somewhat embarrassing. Much like a 45 year old Parent at a college fraternity party trying desperately to show everybody he is still...""cool"". Chances are if you have to desperately work at it, you are just not ""with it"".

If you are a Ferrell fan, you are not likely to enjoy this film....",1388016000,,602,4.513761467889908

8198382,4,B000R2GV7M,"I got to see ""Wake-Up Ron Burgundy"" when it was a free extra that came with a DVD or Blu Ray set back in the day. As a huge Anchorman fan I was very happy to get an hour plus more Anchorman for the price of free (at the time.) However you need to realize these were all deleted scenes from the original movie organized to kind of make a separate story line. I guess the most fascinating thing is how they more or less rewrote Anchorman as many of the scenes would have totally changed the movie had they been included. But don't be surprised to see some pre-Veronica scenes mixed in with post-Veronica scenes because the way they need to make the clips ""fit"" together.

I don't want to give away the various plot points, but suffice to say there is a reason they were cut from the final movie.

What worries me is this may be someone's first Anchorman experience and it could turn them off if they didn't see the original. This is NOT a as polished a movie as you may expect. As others have said, for top fans only- and if you are one check your old DVD or Blu Ray and see if this was included with it before you buy it again.",1505692800,,1126,4.113636363636363
