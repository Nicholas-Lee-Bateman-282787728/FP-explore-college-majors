1341961,5,B00004RE49,"MESSIAH OF EVIL begins with a young woman in a mental institution. She tells of her search for her missing father (played brilliantly by Royal Dano). Her quest takes her to a tiny beach-town called Point Dune. She is joined by a strange trio (Michael Greer and two beautiful women, one of whom was the queen of ""The Bee Girls"") who seem to be seeking answers of their own. Together, they encounter a town population gone mad! Increasingly, we see townfolk who have been slowly transformed into a horde of flesh-eating zombies! In one memorable scene (of which there are many), a girl goes to the movie theatre to see ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"", where she is slowly surrounded by eerie-looking zombie patrons. This flick is an excellent twist on the undead theme, with many genuinely scary moments and a building atmosphere of dread that is almost suffocating. The ""Messiah"" himself is a man in black who first appeared a century ago, killing people and turning them into zombies. He called this his ""new religion"". He left, vowing to return in a hundred years (now) when people would be ready for his rancid gospel. We never get a good look at his face. A macabre, apocalyptic tale of horror. I loved this movie! Highly recommended...",1073606400,26,1231,4.757009345794392
1341962,4,B00004RE49,"The 1970s gave us many interesting horror movies, atmospheric pieces of creepiness and morbidity quite unlike the more direct, flamboyant movies of recent years.  Messiah of Evil does some things very well, producing one quite memorable scene in particular, but it proved a little too vague for me to be able to proclaim it a must-see film.  The opening scene is effective, but it basically has almost nothing to do with the events that soon unfold and is quickly forgotten.  The movie itself is one big flashback, which is a technique that rarely succeeds perfectly, especially when further layers are added in such a way to give us, at one point, a flashback inside a flashback inside a flashback.  I think this movie would have been more effective with a more typical narrative framework, especially since it necessarily robs the viewer of a little bit of suspense.
Arletty (Marianna Hill) goes to Point Dune to check on her father, whose letters have become disturbing of late.  Point Dune's a weird little town, as the gas station attendant outside of town tries to communicate to Arletty.  Our first sight of the zombified inhabitants of the town is a nice one, featuring a truly maniacal large man hauling eyeless bodies in the back of his truck.  When Arletty arrives at her father's house, he is nowhere to be found, but his increasingly strange journal describes a process by which something is trying to take over his body.  In town, Arletty encounters Thom, a strange playboy fellow researching the weird legends of Point Dune with a couple of ""companions"" in tow.  The story, as we learn it, is that a dark man appeared a century ago when the moon turned blood red, established a congregation of followers, then disappeared into the ocean with a promise to return when the time was right.  The villagers ritually stand on the beach each night watching for the return of the dark man.
The real nexus of this movie involves our characters' encounters with the genuinely creepy townspeople.  These are not your ordinary ""need brains"" type of zombies.  Instead of walking around bug-eyed with flesh falling off their faces, they are bone white pale with eyes that stare right through you.  Sure, they love human flesh, devouring any fresh body that comes their way, but that's only natural.  There is one great scene that takes place inside a seemingly all but empty supermarket, but an even more effective scene takes place in a movie theatre.  Our victim arrives to see a handful of scattered individuals in the seats, and as the movie plays we see one zombie after another filing in to sit in the section behind her, gradually encircling her.  This movie communicates fear best in silence, and this is a truly memorable scene.
I must admit I am not quite as enamored of this film as some horror fans seem to be; it's a perfectly good movie told in its own quietly creepy way, but the plot is not as robust as it could be.  I'm also not sure why the movie is called Messiah of Evil (and I should point out that it has also borne the title Dead People); if you are expecting some kind of religious-fuelled apocalypse set around some type of AntiChrist figure, you will be disappointed.  In the final breakdown, I think one's enjoyment of Messiah of Evil comes down to one's love for and interest in the horror genre.  Those raised on a diet of action-packed slasher films may find this movie oppressively slow and boring; those of my ilk who enjoy a European kind of thriller wherein silence speaks louder than words and menace is bred in the most subtle of ways will find much to touch the imagination and satiate the spook-craving heart.  On a final note, Sammy Davis, Jr. fans such as myself will want to make note of the fact that he actually appears in this film, most unexpectedly, in the form of the movie playing at the doom-enshrouded theatre of death.",1052352000,2,3871,4.689807976366322
1341963,4,B00004RE49,"I recently stumbled upon this gem when I purchased a ten-pack of horror DVD's, and loved it. Combine elements of ""Carnival of Souls"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and ""Night of the Living Dead"" and you get ""Messiah of Evil""(aka ""Dead People"").
Of course this film has flaws, but its more than made up for in some truly memorable horror sequences.

1341964,5,B00004RE49,"I have acquired a recent personal sentiment for this film. I was watching the re-mastered version alone in a San Antonio hotel and midway I decided to go for a walk (about 1 am) and sat on an all-night diner and finished watching it on my phone. The bleak abandonment, the searching in a foreign town late at night, shadowy  faces peering around corners added an atmosphere that I haven't felt while viewing a film since the first time I had seen Lets Scare Jessica to Death.

A young beautiful Arletty (Marianna Hill) travels to a dark and dreary town called Point Dune, to visit her abstract artist father. She finds letters in his heavily decorated gallery type, abandoned beach house addressed to her about the Blood Moon and the terrible things that have recently happened to him and the strange things at night, most importantly his foreboding to not look for him.

The next morning, she searches for more answers at a local art gallery and meets Thom (Michael Greer) a well-dressed art snob and his two gal pals who are also curious about the Blood Moon as well. The nightmarish and surreal events that take place after their meeting at the beach house can be likened to a bizarro, Pre Lynchian-Fellini-esque night of horror, that also fades away when the sun rises. At night some of the towns folk turn into a form of cannibalistic vampires that can only be destroyed by fire, tearing one blood droplet from the left eye, wandering the dark streets, in supermarkets and movie theaters added numbers to their ghoulish horde, led by a dark stranger, a 100 yr old a descendant from the ""Donner Party""  Some ghouls leap through high windows, resist gun shots to the throat and one pours a gallon of blue paint on his face to add to the artistic back drop of the film.

A perfect score electronic score adds to the hypnotic and at times psychedelic vibe, similar in tone to Lets Scare Jessica to Death makes this unsung gem an ultimate creepfest. Highly recommended.",1454112000,4,1969,4.646551724137931

It is hampered by some odd editing and its shoestring budget, but the acting is good and it has a kind of H.P.

Plot (includes some SPOILERS): A mysterious stranger, a cannibal priest of the old gods and survivor of the infamous Donner Party, arrives in an 1870s coastal California town to infect others and turn them into the living dead who bleed out their eyes. These flesh-eaters can talk and try to fool you for awhile, but most are of the non-speaking, creepy blank-faced kind. The stranger walks into the sea and promises to return in a hundred years when the world is ready to accept his gods. So a hundred years later, a hot chick comes looking for her missing father, an artist, who it turns out is missing after taking up residence in the town. None of the locals will tell her anything about her dad. She runs into three swingers, a groovy dude and his two ladies, who are into collecting her dad's art. They get the town drunk (Elisha Cook, Jr.) to warn them the dead don't stay dead and ""ya gotta burn 'em!"" The two swinger chicks (smokin'-hot Anitra Ford and Joy Bang) get eaten alive by the ghoulish locals in two separate scenes (one in a Ralph's supermarket, one in a movie theater). The groovy dude and hot chick fall in love and are attacked by the living dead, including her father, who is now one of them. The hot chick starts to turn zombie too, barfing up bugs and lizards, and bleeding out her eyes. Let's just say things don't end well for anyone, and the ending is decidedly Lovecraftian.

This isn't a regular zombie movie, it's more about a cannibal cult of living dead people. It's unclear how the infection spreads exactly, as it seems to be a spiritual, metaphysical sickness of the soul with related physical symptoms rather than a regular zombie-type virus. The gore is just red paint thrown around, but there's a fair amount of it for an early 70s film. There's no explicit cannibalism or zombie bites, unfortunately, but a dude does get set on fire, a zombie eats a rat, and there's a scene with cops shooting at a crowd of zombies, plus zombies jumping down through a skylight to attack.

After reading the gushing reviews here and on IMDB, I was skeptical this movie was going to live up to its cult status, let alone be a decent watch, but was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it is. It's hardly perfect or a ""lost treasure,"" but it's well worth a watch for fans of 70s horror. I give it 3.5 stars.

I will admit that there are times that the dialogue becomes a little ridiculous rather than disturbing (the hotel room scene), and some of the actors and actresses are not as good as others in the film, but it is a horror movie and that is to be expected. All in all though, the movie is fun, and it is one of those films that you experience rather than just watch.

A blind (!) art dealer of her father's work leads to another visitor in Point Dune; a collector of old legends interested in the event that happened there a century ago... when the moon turned blood red and the townspeople began having a taste for raw meat, dead or otherwise... timed perfectly with the arrival of a dark stranger... Might be deemed too weird for some, but the film's oddness blends well with the story at hand. The directing/writing combo of Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (who would later collaborate on American Graffiti, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and perhaps the even more weird Howard the Duck!) create an arty, disturbing and sometimes amusing low budget horror gem that, at the very least, will keep your curiousity riveted.

To me it was nothing more than some obscure 30+ year old title with no more sentimental meaning to me than a picture on an internet page.  However, after reading the reviews on two sites, I decided to pay more than I felt it was worth and give it a go.  I'm so pleased I did.

The camera work was a joy to watch as the minutes marched by.  It continuously teased my eager eyes and dubious expectations with unexpected nuances.  For example, the camera may imply that someone is behind the frightened girl, ready to strike with some ambiguous weapon only to find out it's not a person at all but a painting of a strange looking man seemingly staring at her from his plaster skin.

A movie is made up of the detail and nuances which not only enhance the movie experience but also reveal the creator's care for the project. Through the entire film I never found myself bored or in the slightest way distracted from what the camera was showing me and I can't recall that ever happening before.

I'd also like to point out the masterful way the director used small, inexpensive things to create a big-budget sting in the viewer nerves such as the mural inside the house as it's filled with paintings of strange, sinister men staring at the main character as she sleeps.

1342010,2,B00004RE49,"I blind bought this movie after all the internet praise I read and I wish I hadn't. There were things I liked - the music, art direction, and a handful of scenes - the opening, a creepy rat eating scene, a grocery scene, the theatre scene, people jumping through a roof window scene but that's all about it I liked - some scenes.  The movie as a whole was underwhelming because when those scenes are not happening, the viewer is straddled with bland characters, clunky dialogue and just not much happening on screen.

I absolutely abhorred the constant narration of the lead actress, Marianna Hill, and her onscreen father's journal. The father's journal consisted of going on and on about the red moon and what it does to people in the small sea town.  I really needed to hear it once - not over and over throughout the whole movie, banging me over the head with it.  Hill's narration was worse, often telling the viewer what we can see on the screen.  For example, the viewer sees that Hill and another person are surrounded by the town people and they are swimming in the ocean and she's narrating ""we were surrounded. they were watching us. staring at us. we were in the ocean.""  It took me right out of the movie.

Imagine watching Halloween ('78) and hearing a Jamie Lee Curtis voiceover, ""I grabbed a knitting needle, and hit him with it in the neck. I was afraid.""

I also thought Marianna Hill had no screen presence at all and the tension onscreen was often undone by her poorly delivered, overstated narration and weak performance.  Anitra Ford, who has a small role, would have made a better lead in my opinion.

Approach with caution.",1280620800,10,1647,4.571428571428571

1342015,5,B00004RE49,"Code Red DVD has at long last put out a true masterpiece of genre movie-making for fans of avant-garde horror. Messiah Of Evil ranks right up alongside other 1970's classics such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn Of The Dead, Shivers and Eraserhead with comparative inventive aplomb.

Beginning with the onscreen graphic murder of then aspiring young actor and soon to be renowned movie director Walter Hill this visually poetic tale of dark forces at play in a small fictitious Californian costal town known as Pointe Dune mesmerises the viewer like a moth to a night flame. Told from the perspective of a woman in search of her artist father in the titular town where she meets an effete, but intriguing man and his two female charges and their unfolding encounters which occur therein.

If you enjoy cinema which transports you to a world of visual originality where fantastic heightened reality becomes a doorway to impressions, ideas, emotional engagement, stimulating imagery and an abundance of atmospheric ambience, this film is one to savour and treasure. This art-house-horror film has made and left a lasting resonance upon this viewer.

If you are a fan of such film directors as David Cronenberg, David Lynch, George Romero, Dario Argento and other enigmatic examples of 1970's cinema then I urge you to order this lost treat unearthed and beautifully restored with many extra's including a commentary track, interviews and short film by the same director all wrapped up in an evocative sleeve from rising cult label new stars Code Red DVD",1263254400,16,1555,5.042801556420233

Devil's Nightmare is the more exploitive of the two horror films with a great lesbian scene and reminds me of what a Hammer film might be like if an Italian director made it.  Both films though are quite entertaining but for different reasons as Messiah is rather serious and moody while Nightmare is more playful and conventional.

So, if you're tired of cgi-filled action movies posing as horror films nowadays, you should definitely give this one-two punch a try.

I watched this the other night and I have to admit it was pretty hard to sit through for the most part. Messiah did feature a few redeeming scenes as before mentioned; the supermarket, movie theater, beach-mouse, also the ending bit. There was a nice narrative from the father's journal throughout the film that voiced over some scenes very reminiscent of the Evil Dead films. Overall, it seemed like a very lazy attempt to make a zombie movie almost like the director wasn't sure about if he wanted it to be one or not. *Lil Spoiler*- In one scene the ""zombies"" eat another zombie after this guy knocks one across the head. Now why wouldn't they just eat each other all the time?
For the die-hard zombie fans, this definitely isn't a ""full on"" zombie movie. Basically its about this town of weirdos who cry blood and feel the need to eat raw meat and people from time to time. Everyone needs their hobbies.

The film moves fairly slowly, dripping with an atmosphere of impending doom, leading to a chaotic climax. Most people who see the movie will like the three standout, almost Hitchcockian scenes: the gas station scene at the beginning, the grocery store scene and the movie theater (those plus the minimalist soundtrack leads me to believe the filmmakers must have studied THE BIRDS). As for myself I like the very well written narration & dialogue, the scenes on the beach and the beach house, Thom who reminds me of a Lovecraft or Poe character (a traveller searching out legends and making his own occult studies- sort of like the lead character in VAMPYR), the back story about the ""dark stranger"" (hence MESSIAH OF EVIL) and the almost palpable sense of isolation and the end of the world.

1342025,5,B00004RE49,"THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE (1971; 93 minutes; Belgium/Italy)

THE PLOT: Seven people are forced to spend the night in some eerie castle. The devil sends a succubus to kill each one that indulges in one or more of the seven deadly sins (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy/jealousy and pride).

COMMENTARY: Wow, this is a real hidden gem of Gothic horror. It has a great cast & story and was filmed in a real castle. The people and the sins they indulge in are as follows:

Pride - Alvin, the Seminarian

Envy - Corinne (the hot brunette), the collector of men

Gluttony - Mr. Ducha, the Tour Driver

Lust - Howard Foster, Corinne's last addition to her collection

Anger - Mr. Mason, the constant complainer

Greed - Nancy Foster, the gold seeking angry wife

Sloth - Regine, the (hot) sleepy blonde

Some, of course, are guilty of more than one main sin, such as:

- Nancy Foster, the angry wife: jealousy (although her husband gives her good reason to be jealous), envy (of the beauty of the other women) and anger (I don't think she smiles once, except when she's literally swimming in gold).

- Corinne: lust (lesbianism & adultery).

- Regine: lust (lesbianism).

A handful of observations:

- If the bus driver was really THAT gluttonous wouldn't he be a lot heavier? (Like Fat Bast*** from Austin Powers).

- If Regine (the blond) were really THAT lazy how could she possibly have that ultra-hot body?

- Although the priest-in-training flirts with pride (listen to him during the chess match) and lust (for the redhead) he evidently never commits a mortal sin (or, if he does, he humbly & quickly repents rather than revel in it like the others).

*** MINOR SPOILER ALERT *** Note that the seminarian willingly sacrifices himself to perdition to prevent the other six from being damned. This is an example of agape love and displays a Christ-like heart. Paul the apostle had the same spirit as evidenced in Romans 9:3. *** END SPOILER ***

- But doesn't Alvin know you can't make honest deals with the ""father of lies""?

- No one can argue that the film glorifies the various negative behaviors because *** SPOILER ALERT *** they all end up dying for their sins. *** END SPOILER ***

HIGHLIGHTS: As noted, the film features three incredibly gorgeous women -- a blond, brunette and redhead, no less. The succubus is the redhead, played by Erika Blanc. All three are voluptuous; each possessing a very distinctive beauty. (Their NATURAL curvy-ness is refreshing in comparison to too many modern American actresses who often appear nigh anorexic and artificial, if you know what I mean). It goes without saying that, if you have a lust problem, you might want to skip this one, especially in light of a fairly overt lesbian scene.

Another highlight is Erika Blanc's subtle make-up as the succubus combined with her amazing ability to contort her face from stunningly sharp to utterly hideous. I almost never get frightened by horror films, but when Erika morphs into the succubus and hideously contorts her face, it's pretty chilling.

TECHNICAL INFO: Some versions of the film have a tasteless porno-horror ""intro"" tacked on. This lengthy ""intro"" is not part of the original picture and simply has no business being there; in fact, it horribly mars it. No doubt it was tacked on by some latter-day producer in order to excite pre-pubescent boys (""Oooh, that's cooooool!""). The version featured with ""Messiah of Evil"" doesn't have this silly intro, but the sound quality isn't very good. I saw another version that has the intro but the sound quality was fine.

FYI: The original title translated to English is ""The Long Night of the Devil"" or ""The Devil's Longest Night."" I feel the title ""The Devil's Nightmare"" is weak and much prefer another alternative title (used on the VHS): ""The Devil Walks at Midnight.""

FINAL WORD: Since this is a European film from the early 70s it's understandably dated, dubbed and slow-paced. The viewer must keep this in mind to appreciate it. Many themes are touched upon: Does God exist? What about the devil and his demonic servants? Can he be trusted to make a deal with? (Yeah, right). Is there such a thing as sin? And, if so, what are its consequences? Another fascinating theme is human nature and the continual conflict between spiritual and carnal qualities with which we can all relate. The film also powerfully addresses the self-sacrificial nature of agape love.

Make no mistake, this is a powerful piece of Gothic-horror cinema, perhaps even a masterpiece.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot at Chteau d'Antoing, Antoing, Hainault, Wallonia, Belgium.

GRADE: A (keeping in mind its age and origins)

=========================================================================

MESSIAH OF EVIL (1973; 90 minutes; USA)

THE PLOT: A woman (Marianna Hill) goes to the California coastal town of Point Dune to visit her artist father. She can't find him, but runs into a guy (Michael Greer) and his two female companions (Anitra Ford & Joy Bang). They all soon discover that there are mysterious and peculiar things going on in town: The people are somnambulistic and mysteriously stand at the shore every twilight looking out to sea. Things eventually take a deadly turn.

COMMENTARY: The film is highly atmospheric, effectively combining elements of ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) and ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). It's on par with ""Carnival"" but not quite as great as ""Night,"" a classic horror masterpiece.

HIGHLIGHTS: As noted above, Marianna Hill is the doe-eyed protagonist. You may not remember her, but she's one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on the Original Series of Star Trek, specifically the episode ""Dagger of the the Mind"" as Dr. Helen Noel. The film is a must for fans of Ms. Hill (like me) since she is prominently featured.

TECHNICAL INFO: Both the sound and video are pretty good for such an old and obscure picture.

FYI: The original title was ""Dead People,"" which is more fitting than ""Messiah of Evil,"" but way too generic. The title ""Messiah of Evil"" gives the impression that the story prominently features a weirdo dark Christ-figure, but this is hardly the case. The dark messiah is ambiguous and barely featured. A more fitting title of the film would be ""Village of the Dead"" or something along those lines.

BOTTOM LINE: Many hail this as a moody horror masterpiece from the early 70s. It definitely has a few notable highlights and is mandatory viewing for 60s-70s mystery/horror aficionados and admirers of the lovely Marianna Hill. Unfortunately, it's actually kind of boring and the whole ""dark messiah"" side of the story is seriously insubstantial.

1342026,4,B00004RE49,"I have this flick in a 10 DVD compilation called ""Nightmares From the Crypt"" (a must-own for the price vs. entertainment ratio).  The movie is very schlock early 70's horror with an outrageously silly theme-song.  The movie is sort of slow-moving, but not boring in the least.  It also has a very attractive leading lady, a corny rich playboy with 2 of his sleazy girlfriends, and an awesome horror character known as the ""Albino Man"".  This freak is really tall, cross-eyed and eats beach rats while listening to Wagner, driving around the living dead in the bed of his pickup truck.  For me, this guy really makes the movie what it is & would like to see him in another flick (which I highly doubt he's in any other).  Me and my buddies got a big kick out of this guy when he demonstrates to a young woman his appetite for beach rats as he offers her one.  This same young woman eventually gets devoured in an empty supermarket after the Albino Man drops her off.

The movie has a European art-film vibe to it even though it is certainly an American film.  The leading character's father was an artist who created these freaky montages of the people who inhabit Point Dune & is actually quite effectively spooky.  This movie is for those late late nights with your favorite tobacco & some friends who enjoy this obscure early 70's horror.  The older it looks, the better.  I was surprised to see Sammy Davis Jr. in this film, who surprisingly must've given the producers permission to use his likeness.  The matinee scene is absolutely classic, as you see the zombies stare vacantly at the hapless woman with a bloody tear.  These zombies aren't of the typical ilk and I think they are more effective in this movie than the usual rotting corpse version.

All in all, this movie is sort of mild, but highly entertaining in its schlockiness & ridiculous premise.

Essentially, the film revolves around the full moon event every 100 years when a mysterious stranger comes to the seaside community of Point Dume. On that night, the townspeople (sic) turn into flesh eating zombies. Now, this is NOT a new idea. I used to live in a seaside town where this actually happened during my lifetime. (Real Estate values rise and fall every 100 years or so.) However, it is done very well in this crazy film. (I have a cameo role in the background. I lost an arm in one of the zombie scenes. I lived to tell, and write, about it).

See the cool supermarket scene and the chilling movie theatre scene. See the aforementioned Albino Man in the pickup truck (a really unique character in horror films, generally).

This film is so corny in soundtrack, plot, scenes, concept and actors that it stands out as an exceptional early 1970's flesh eating zombie film. It set the stage for numerous copy-cats.

Be forewarned! This is NOT a cheap Italian gore-fest. This film has an ever-present creepy class about it that sets it apart from any other film.

A young woman travels to a small seaside town to search for her missing father, a local artist. There, she meets a curious *mnage a trois*: An effete researcher into ancient legends and his two female traveling companions. The uncooperative townspeople from whom they seek information resemble somnambulists, especially at night, when they gather on the beach and gaze longingly out to sea under a reddening moon. Other weird and terrifying portents soon appear: An old drunkard warns the heroine that, here, the corpses must be burned, not buried; a man offers a hitchhiker a mouse--when she refuses it, he eats it alive; tears of blood drip from the townspeople's eyes; live insects and vermin spew from their mouths. As the heroine and her companions delve deeper into the mystery, they find themselves engulfed in cataclysmic violence, and the secret of the messiah of evil, as well as the fate of the girl's father, transpires at last.

What this bare synopsis omits completely is the true source of the film's power: Its overwhelming and consistent poetic atmosphere of doom. From the dismal organ and synthesizer music that underpins the heroine's first exploration of her father's empty studio and its strange *trompe l'oeil* murals, to the massed townspeople waiting expectantly on the beach like sleepwalkers in a Delvaux painting, *Messiah of Evil* creates a perfect microcosmic nightmare world.

7920692,3,B00004RE49,"For some reason, this reminded me a lot of Carnival of Souls, which was made over a decade earlier. Like Carnival of Souls, It had a dream-like strangeness and interesting visuals, which also reminded me of some of Dario Argento's films, which also twin mental delusion and horror and seem unimpeded by rationality. It also had a certain hippie-paranoia vibe. For comparison, look at Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Argento's Suspiria, Robert Altman's Images, Robert Mulligan's The Other, and Roman Polanski's Repulsion, all produced in the same decade, to see how scary this approach can prove to be. Another one to consider is Dan O'Bannon's Dead and Buried, which also takes place in a small seaport town. I also liked the more recent Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters, which has stunning photography and genuine shivers. Ben Wheatley's Kill List, in some respects an homage to the 70s films (like Messiah of Evil) about murderous Satanic cults, deserves consideration, too. In any case, while this film was, in some respects, derivative, it deserves a look. These other films I have mentioned have higher production values, but Messiah of Evil is worthy of inclusion with these, though one has to appreciate the fact that it doesn't have to make sense in order to work.",1472256000,8,1273,4.953271028037383

7920694,1,B00004RE49,"After reading the glowing praise from several of the more ""effete elite"", I thought I might be in for a treat.  Instead I got boredom.  This is not an artistic masterpiece, it's a piece of doo-doo.  Since it is from the early '70s one may think it was made using LSD and pot, but they do not produce this kind of unartistic garbage.  No, but a lobotomy might.

If you're looking for a definition of the word ""lamoid"" then watch this, then go get a lobotomy.",1468800000,,457,4.267441860465116

7920696,5,B00004RE49,First off these are two good classics the horror movies was made in the 1970's; which was the best decade to produce horror movies.,1463443200,,131,4.5
7920697,2,B00004RE49,"I agree with the writer who only gave this movie one star.  I found the movie to drag and considered turning it off several times but did not because I thought I might miss some significant ""action"".  Bad guess on my part.  The pace of the movie never accelerated.  I also felt that the acting was less than first rate but that may have been the fault of the director in that he may have been going for the slow, boring snail's pace in the story.

The video and audio quality were decent in the DVD version I bought.  However, nothing could overcome the languid feel of the slow pace.",1456531200,3,584,4.263636363636364
