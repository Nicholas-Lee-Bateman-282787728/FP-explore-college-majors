7943284,3,B00005KHJA,I don't know why this is on my list. I don't actually have this on DVD but I have seen the Dirty Pair OVAs and I do like them.,1424736000,,126,3.3793103448275863
7943285,1,B00005KHJA,"This release of the Dirty Pair OVAs has some of the worst cases of ghosting I've ever seen in a DVD. If something moves too fast across the screen or if the scene changes, prepare to see after-images all over your screen.

The OVAs themselves are fantastic, so go out and buy the Right Stuf Nozomi release, whom have done a really great job with this.",1366934400,,351,4.318181818181818
7943286,5,B00005KHJA,"This collection has the very first Dirty Pair I happened to view and enjoyed immensely some years ago in Japanese language without English subtitles - even though I couldn't understand Japanese at that time! (The  clarity of the action and comedy easily reached beyond the language. That's how good it was.) The OAV I saw was the prison break and rescue episode. I was delighted by the wild action and humorous antics of Kei and Yuri, and I've happily followed their adventures and mayhem ever since.

The Dirty Pair are two tough (and very foxy) female agents that get into James-Bondish-science-fiction type high adventures.  Kei and Yuri's antics and adventures has been released in Japan as OAVs, as movies, as a TV series, and as SF literature.

The Dirty Pair adventures originally started out as SF novels. The novels are now also available in North America after being translated and brought over by Dark Horse publications.

(Anyone who has seen it will recognize the impact it, and the show Lupin III, had on the anime series 'Cowboy Bebop'.)

I recommend the series to anyone looking for great action/comedy adventures with the (ahem) 'Lovely Angels' team of Kei and Yuri.",1202947200,2,1484,5.6968325791855206
7943287,4,B00005KHJA,"This is a really cool 80's space anime. Though my only complaint is that they changed the music in the dub version. My favorite episode on this disc is the Halloween one, for i thought it was the most funny. Not to mention that one of my friend's little sister is really into this series.",1181347200,,288,4.254545454545455
7943288,5,B00005KHJA,"Anime is japanese for fun, so that is the spirit in which we should take films like this.  It is the original girl power movie.  the girls have a good off again on again relationship that keeps sanity in bikins amid all of the craziness.",1014076800,2,237,4.2444444444444445
7943289,4,B00005KHJA,"This is a very nice DVD containing the first 5 episodes of the 10 episode Dirty Pair OAV series. Not to be confused with any of the movies/OAV's previously released by Streamline. The episodes look similar to the TV series in their designs and animation. The pair tackle five more assignments of galactic significance with their usual carefree manner and disregard for property. Much of the fun is in the pair's rocky friendship. The DVD is well done in several regards. The liberties taken with the dub seem largely to add to the charm of the show or at least not detract from it. My big complaint with the dub is the foul language which, though I don't disapprove of itself, is a little overused. The subtitle is more literal and feels competent. Each episode is selectable directly from the main menu and starts from a preview of the episode, which is very convenient when you just want to know which one it is. You can select Japanese, English, or English with Op/End Lyrics which is also a nice feature. Credits appear before and after every episode and the lyrics alternate between translated and romanji. Bonus material includes a text-less opening animation but no closing. The picture looked like it was taken from a quality master. The sound I can't really comment on but it looks like Dolby Digital 2-channel for both English and Japanese and sounded clear to me. The only thing I could think to add might be a gallery of some kind, or some liner notes. This was intended for VHS or LaserDisk viewing and made during the 80's, it's no Mononoke Hime. Taking this into consideration I think this is a great DVD that is worth the money. I give it four stars. I only hope ADV can release the TV series in a similar fashion. Please.",1007510400,11,1738,4.591639871382637
7943290,4,B00005KHJA,"I'll get to the point.  This DVD is about a pair of interplanetary police agency, or something like that, that do their police work while wearing bikinis.  In the four episodes they: save a prison warden, destroy a berserk robot, disarm a bunch of spoiled brats, and shut down a casino.  Since this is old school anime, the graphics are not the best but OK, plots are adequate for 25-minute episodes.  No explicit violence or nudity, so it's OK for kids.  I would have given a 3-star rating if it wasn't for the jokes that the girls crack about each other constantly.  Did I mention that they mostly wear bikinis!",1006905600,6,613,4.527272727272727
