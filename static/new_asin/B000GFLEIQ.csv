2606955,3,B000GFLEIQ,"This review is for the HD DVD version of this film.......

Overall the movie is just OK. Like the title says, its entertaining if there is nothing better on TV. I bought the HD DVD version after not seeing this film for nearly 8 years. Too bad i didn't rent this before buying it. lol The HD DVD version is pretty good for the quality but the film itself is lacking. This is ment for only those who are die-hard Arnie fans....",1205020800,,426,4.195121951219512
2606956,1,B000GFLEIQ,"I'm revewing the HD DVD version of this movie. My rating is based on the movie itself.

THE MOVIE:
First let me start by saying that I love Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. If you have even some religious convictions, don't watch this movie. It seems to glorify the devil too much. Although it seems a little similar to the movie ""Fallen"" with Danzel Wahington, Fallen has far more suspense and the events are unfolded gradually as you watch the movie. The End of Days reveils the story (and possibly the outcome) from the beginning, and becomes very predictable. Religious people who believe in God might find some lines very offensive. Why? here's a quote: The devil speaking about God to Jericho (Arnold) ""...And where was God? He could've stopped it. but He didn't. He f**d you. And then He made you feel guilty...etc..

THE HD DVD:
If the movie is NOT good, who cares how good the picture is?? Having said that, the quality of tranfer is AVERAGE in HD DVD standard. Most of the scenes where shot in dark places, or at night. If you must see this movie, rent it or buy the standard DVD version from a Walmart for few dollars.

I think buying this movie is a waste of money, when we have so many great choices available.

A Final note: Most of these reviews express the ""opinion"" of the reviewer, others might disagree. In my opinion, this movie is the one to avoid.",1163030400,5,1366,4.518218623481781
2606957,5,B000GFLEIQ,"This is how an exclusive studio should do it.  The picture quality is great throughout, with great depth, excellent shadow detail and solid blacks;  the colors are also spot on.  Where this title really excels is in the audio department.  The TrueHD lossless track is absolute reference quality.  This title is worth the purchase for the aural experience alone.  The extras are decent, most likely a port of everything that was on the normal dvd release, and the movie is a very fun ""bad"" movie.

All in all a great disk that is well worth the money.",1160438400,5,550,4.608247422680412

8131302,4,B000GFLEIQ,"I liked this film the first time I saw it, and like it now just the same. The charecters are flawed somewhat, but the actors playing them do a decent job, and seem to have a lot of fun with it.
I'm sick and tired of critics acting like they know good from bad, because to me, 98% of the time, they don't know
squat! Thus, a shining example being this film, good vs. evil has been done numerous times, and granted, this isn't the most original way either, but still enjoyable, plus being an Arnold fan doesn't hurt, although he seems alot more humane in this, even though he does still wreak alot of havoc here. Gabriel Byrne does a good devilish figure too-obviously the primary villian, I've seen my share of devilish depictions-and the one here doesn't dissapoint.
The remaining cast does a nice job too, even though some don't last too long. I'm getting kind of tired of saying
the same thing-but here you shouldn't expect biblical accuracy, try taking it on its own merits, Cloud ten pictures, take note.",1266192000,,1008,4.5136612021857925
