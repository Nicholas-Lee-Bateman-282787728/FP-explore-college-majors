8666397,5,B00LLNLNF6,"If you love an impressionist approach to painting that emphasizes the joy of both color as well as the process of painting, this is the video you have been seeking!  Fresia's approach to a scene is a lyrical one, beginning with a gestural line and alternating with stages of color applied poetically.  The dance between line and color stages in the painting process allows the suggestion of form in the final result without sacrificing the totality of the surrounding atmosphere enveloping the subject.",1458259200,,502,5.036144578313253
8666398,5,B00LLNLNF6,"Amazing videos!! Jerry presents a clear and concise method of painting that encompasses ways to be free when we paint. Jerry stresses painting is about feeling and the excitement that goes with it. It is about who we are and not always what we do. These videos are must for anyone wanting to take their painting to another level !!!

8666399,4,B00LLNLNF6,"Very nicely done video that has helped me to improve my painting.
This video was very focused on what it was trying to convey and
accomplished it much better than most videos I've seen. When
you're done viewing it you really feel like you got what you needed.
The type of things I thought were missing, that would have been
helpful include types of canvas, comments regarding how different
French impressionists actually applied the technique themselves.
That would have been nice. Just the same, this video really communicates
the basic technique very well and is extremely helpful. Thanks very much Jerry!",1424476800,,607,5.01980198019802
8666400,5,B00LLNLNF6,"GREAT BOOK , VERY INFORMATIVE , EASY TO UNDERSTAND. ENJOYED READING IT.  LEARNED A LOT
BEAUTIFUL COLOR , SOME DAY HOPE TO TAKE A WORK SHOP WITH JERRY FRESIA",1418688000,,156,4.379310344827586
8666401,5,B00LLNLNF6,"I have benefitted immensely from reading Fresia's books and have enjoyed following his blog for some time, so I wasn't certain that I would learn more from him through the video, but I was wrong.  I have now watched the video a number of times, and during each viewing, I gain more understanding of the method.  Perhaps more importantly, I am always encouraged to continue my own painting journey.  I recommend the video, especially to those who need a gifted teacher who will not only provide guidance but will also inspire  them to paint.",1412553600,2,540,4.712765957446808
8666402,5,B00LLNLNF6,"Jerry Fresia is a master teacher. His ability to present the concepts involved in the capture of a desired artistic impression is remarkable. As a teacher and someone who has participated in one of  his workshops, I strongly encourage others who wish to initiate the journey towards a deep understanding of impressionism in its truest form to include both his book, ""The Practice and Philosophy of French Impressionism"" and ""Impressionism: The Authentic Method:"" DVD in their art library.
  His book is a gold mine of information about the history, development and processes involved in impressionist paintings and the DVD clearly depicts each step in the creation of an impressionist painting and emphasizes the importance of enjoying each phase of the painting. I consider them essential teaching and reference materials in support of  gaining an understanding of true impressionism.",1411862400,,885,5.391304347826087
8666403,4,B00LLNLNF6,"Great color, wonderful talent; only wished it went into seeing and identifying the color he uses.",1409961600,,97,5.125
8666404,5,B00LLNLNF6,"There is no way to define Jerry Fresia except as ""genius."" He is the 21st century Renaissance man.  His pedagogy brilliant.  His command of the mechanics of painting in the impressionist manner is superb.  Now when I look at a blank canvas I don't freeze.  These DVDs have given me the confidence to pick up a brush and made a mark without being intimidated.  So many of us get lost in the ""what do I do next?""  These DVDs teach you ""what to do next.""  Consequently,  you are free to be yourself, to try different ideas, to begin to really see color.  Finally,  to play and to enjoy the experience,  an essential feature of Jerry's teaching -- the spiritual aspect.  After studying with the DVDs, take a workshop with him.  You will meet an exciting mind, a delightful brilliant observer of life with a deep affinity for the joyousness of art in all its forms.  Jerry teaches you not only the craft of art but its spiritual dimensions.  Translation: he shows you how to recapture the sheer joyousness of being by delving into delicious color,  expressive charcoal marks, and seeing nature once more as you did as a child. . . by squinting!  Have fun!",1408838400,4,1150,4.53170731707317
