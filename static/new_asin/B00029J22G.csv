8024325,3,B00029J22G,"The movie was short and typical urban adventure, but I liked the message that Little Romeo gave in his presentation about Decisions.  Depending on our taste in movies, the rest of the movie can be judged as you see fit.  I purchased this for less than $3, so I'm not complaining, but it's not worth much more than that. . It's just my opinion.",1359072000,,343,4.34375

8024327,5,B00029J22G,"Decisions is a great film. There is no disputing this fact. Master P pulled out all of the stops on this film. It is usually categorized as a German expressionist film, which for most people conjures images of disjointed scenes with no real meaning and most generally a labor to sit through. I will not lie to you, Decisions is perhaps one of the most complex films ever made and is very demanding of the viewer. Nothing comes easy with this film. ""What does this mean?"" This questions will course through the viewer's mind all through the film. I will not attempt to decipher what the film means; I am not a scholar of the film, the genre, the director, or the historical context in which it was made. All I know is that it broke my heart to pieces, only to fix the hole I had inside.",1114992000,3,785,4.3108108108108105

Master P, RIP. I hope you're in a better place now where you can make movies that'll make Jesus happy.",1114992000,2,215,4.2439024390243905
