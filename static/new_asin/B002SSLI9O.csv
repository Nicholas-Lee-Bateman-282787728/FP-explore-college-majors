8379602,5,B002SSLI9O,"I purchased this DVD after I saw some preview clips on YouTube. I'm thrilled with the purchase. There are too few DVD's of this nature available. It is honest, engaging and spectacular. Joseph Gatti's strength and technical abilities are on display. Finis Jhung provides insight behind the movement and male dancer bravura.

I found the DVD to be valuable for these reasons:

* Instructional (for myself as a male ballet dancer)
* Educational (seeing the teaching methods Finis Jhung uses)
* Honest (an uncensored presentation of male dancer bravura, as if you were there for the master class)
* Enlightening (seeing Joseph Gatti describe personal dance preferences)
* Accurate (performance break downs with step by step details)

You will enjoy this DVD if you:

* Enjoy the power behind male ballet dancing
* Value the technique required to perform male ballet solos
* Want to learn performance tips and tricks
* Want to see break downs of advanced male ballet solos
* Appreciate the dedication of high caliber male ballet dancers

Bravo!",1279670400,14,1040,5.023255813953488
