2693286,5,6300180093,"Hands of Steel is an often overlooked Italian scifi movie, from director Sergio Martino, the director of the best Italian post-apocaplyse movie, ""After the Fall of New York"". It stars Daniel Greene (the truck driver who died from ""Falcon Crest""), as a cyborg named Paco Querack. He is ordered by his superiors to kill revolutionary environmentalist Arthur Mosely, but at the last second his conscience kicks in, and Paco lets him live. Paco is now on the run from the men who created him.
With great music from Claudio Simonetti (of Goblin) and featuring the last performance of Claudio Cassinelli (who died in a helicopter crash during the making of this movie), Hands of Steel is an excellent scifi film (although not quite post-apocalypse).",1047427200,5,743,5.0

Only a calculator watch of the future can sum up a film that will grab you by the heart and leave your soul behind. Just when you think this film has run out of gas, it goes over a cliff and blows up.

8157920,5,6300180093,"This movie was great and definitely worth a watch. The story line was easily comprehensible and the movie was well paced and moved along well. The performances were all well done. I particularly liked the character ""Raoul Morales"" but Daniel Greene's performance was strong, and perhaps best of all was Janet Agren as the sympathetic, hard working, wants to do what's right type. I also found myself interested in the world that these characters inhabited, where environmental degradation has advanced and the political movements are deeply influenced by ecological causes. The negative reviewers typically point to the films poor special effects (by modern standards) and cliched 80's action feel. Those aspects are present, but they don't make the film any less enjoyable. I highly recommend this film.",1511568000,,804,5.338582677165355
8157921,5,6300180093,"In a post-apocalyptic world, where office buildings, hotels, and just about everything else, is equipped w/ dryer-duct hoses everywhere, HANDS OF STEEL (aka: ATOMIC CYBORG- 1986) begins. It stars Daniel Greene as Paco Queruak, a cyborg assigned to assassinate an enemy of the state. Using his patented borg-fu, Paco infiltrates the enemy headquarters, but can't complete his mission. Perhaps there were too many dryer-duct hoses in his way. Paco escapes into the wasteland. Meanwhile, the big-big boss, Francis Turner (John Saxon- BLACK CHRISTMAS, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), is not happy, and sends his operatives out to find Paco, who winds up in a desert truck-stop / brothel, complete w/ truck-stop / brothel-sized dryer-duct hoses. Here, Paco falls for the owner, Linda (Janet Agren), and becomes an arm wrestler. Turner's men are hot on his steel heels, paying a visit to his creator, destroying his lab, which is mostly made of dryer-duct hoses. Back at the Truck-stop / brothel, sweaty truckers arm wrestle for fun and profit. Champion arm wrestler, Raul (George Eastman- ANTHROPOPHAGOUS, ENDGAME) challenges Paco to hold his hand, grunt, and sweat a lot. This results in mayhem, as futuristic truckers are sore losers, and no match for borg-fu! Oh no! Some local ""indians"" have fallen into a gorge! Oh no! It's a set up! Hours of merciless beatings later, Paco faces his biggest challenge, in the form of a man who looks as though he's made of iron-packed lard! Not surprisingly, Paco is victorious. Simultaneously, Turner's men are zeroing in on the truck-stop / brothel! Can an explosive, borg-fu / dryer-duct hose-filled finale be far off? BOOM! CRASH! BANG! Nope. Even if you have to sell your children, do not miss the battle between Paco and the female cyborg assassin! LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS GREAT FILM: #1- One should never hide in a trailer during a shootout! #2- Laser guns make ricochet sounds, just like regular guns, whenever the laser hits anything! #3- In the future, clothes dryers will no longer need duct hoses, causing a glut, leading to a world unlike any we could possibly imagine!...",1509408000,4,2117,5.051428571428572

8157924,5,6300180093,This movie rocks so hard. The VHS was in great shape and played like it was it's first day in a VCR.,1452729600,,100,3.590909090909091
8157925,3,6300180093,"This movie appears to be Italian made, and in many ways it inherits the history of the Maciste and Hercules movies made during the 1950's and 1960's.  The movie includes a body-builder type running around doing feats of strength, all loosely tied together with a moderately incoherent plot.

The underlying plot is that the bad guys want a good guy dead, and our protagonist, Paco Queruak, played by Daniel Green, is supposed to kill the good guy.  Daniel Green made many appearances on television and in other movies, including ""Me, Myself and Irene,"" ""Shallow Hal,"" and who could ever forget his appearance on ""Elvira:  Mistress of the Dark""?  His roles have typically been ""muscle bound guy who has few lines.""

The mover and shaker behind all the manipulation is John Saxon, who has about five minutes of screen time, perhaps just so that they could associate his name with the movie.  Saxon has had a long and successful career with so dozens of movie and television credits, including ""Joe Kidd,"" ""Enter the Dragon,"" and ""The Last Samurai.""

After not killing the good guy, the whole rest of the movie is about the bad guys chasing the wayward bad guy, who is supposedly a cyborg.  This movie has a bunch of titles, none of which seem to relate to each other.  The title in the U.S. seems to have been ""Hands of Steel.""  The original Italian title was ""Vendetta dal Futuro,"" which, roughly translated, means vendetta of the future.  Some other titles seem to include ""Atomic Cyborg"" and ""Return of the Terminator,"" recalling that Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""The Terminator"" was released the year before.  Strangely, the title that seems the closest to the movie may be ""Hands of Steel,"" because our hero, Paco, ends up in some arm wrestling contests.

Witness the excitement as our hero drives through acid rain!  The excitement increases as our hero arm wrestles his way through a bunch of desert hicks in Arizona.  See our hero tortured on the back of a tow truck!  Yes, this movie is a ball of excitement from beginning to end.  I also do not want to forget the scientist whose lab of carefully arranged dryer hoses is destroyed by the bad guys.  Yes, this movie is truly cutting edge or any era.

Sadly, Claudio Cassinelli, who plays Peter Howell, one of the bad guys, died in a helicopter crash during the filming of this movie.  The helicopter somehow ran into a bridge and both the pilot and Cassinelli perished.

One thing about this movie that I find strange is that the back story of the assassination still occasionally intrudes as the movie progresses, even though the back story adds nothing else to the plot.  Perhaps it was supposed to heighten the urgency of finding Paco, but it fails in that.  Paco failed to assassinate the good guy, the good guy lived, end of story.  Someone else could have referred to his continued recovery rather than having any focus on him.  However, the same thing applied to other scenes that have nothing to do with Paco.  It appears that the director and producer wanted to find something else in their movie besides muscle man Paco running around chopping wood and performing feats of strength, and their answer was to throw in scenes of FBI news conferences, and scenes of the good guy recovering in the hospital.

This movie includes other marvelous features, including a phenomenally low budget, and awful dialogue.  I would complain about Daniel Green's acting, or lack of acting, but Green was supposed to be a cyborg, so that explains the wooden expression.

Even though this movie is filled with clichs of all sort, even though the budget was low, and even with the dated, repetitive soundtrack, this movie is actually watchable, which is why I gave it three stars.  You do need to be in the right frame of mind to watch this movie, and you should have a penchant for cheesy movies about bad guys and rednecks running around in the desert chasing a ""cyborg,"" with a dash of science fiction thrown in for good measure.  It appears that one of the titles attempts to capitalize on the success of ""The Terminator,"" but if that is the case you would have to call this movie ""Terminator Light.""  Indeed, because the cyborg part of the movie is minimal, it would be really light.

Good Luck!",1361491200,4,4243,4.720108695652174
8157926,4,6300180093,"I'm sure it seemed cutting edge at the time, with the cyborgs and computers, but this movie is cheeeeeesy. My husband and I gave it the MST3K treatment as we watched it, it was ripe for the picking. Like the scene with Paco driving through the ""acid rain"", the shooting scenes (no one can hit ANYTHING) and the entire fight scene with the female cyborg. The soundtrack, while low quality is probably the highlight of the movie, with its Miami Vice-like synthesizers.",1218499200,2,466,4.695121951219512
