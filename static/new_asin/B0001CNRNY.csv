1989529,5,B0001CNRNY,"THE LONDON ASSIGNMENT is a remarkable short film. It captures the fun and excitement of the Van Helsing character and universe as it tells a remarkably rich and sophisticated story, given its relatively short running time. Though I liked the animation, this one seems to belong too the writers who create a fascinating story and deliver great action-movie dialogue that Hugh Jackman delivers with style.  I hope we see more animated Van Helsing films by the same team.",1084838400,,468,5.0
1989530,1,B0001CNRNY,"It pains me to write a bad review about this because I love the actors, but this was poorly written and poorly animated.  The only plus I could find on this DVD is the bonus material.  Save your money, folks.",1084752000,3,208,4.175
1989531,4,B0001CNRNY,"The London assignment is an animated prequel, that shows the battle against Mr. Hyde which concludes in the live action theatrical film. The animation is quite good, with nice use of shadows, and some neat 3d effects too.  The story is just as outrageous as the one in the movie, but it's tighter, and makes more sense, and fortunatly the surprisingly whiney, and irritating ""Re-Vamp"" of  Dracula they did in the live action movie is nowhere to be found here - which is good, since he was by far the worst thing about the otherwise fun movie.  There is lots of action, much of it violent with a fair amount of blood splattering about. The extras are enjoyable as well, with good making of type stuff. Overall, I enjoyed this show, now if only they'd do another featuring the Wolf Man, who RULED in the Movie!",1084233600,3,808,4.52054794520548
1989532,2,B0001CNRNY,"This is a 30 minute cartoon explaining why the movie ""Van Helsing"" begins in Paris with Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde. There is no need to go any deeper into the plot. What's worse than the plot is the animation, which is flat and looks cheep. It's so bad that the computer animated components  stick out very badly in some of the scenes and clash with the backgrounds.  If you are expecting quality along the lines of The Animatrix or HBO's Spawn series, lower your standards a bit. You will be less disappointed if you are expecting the quality of an after school special. The actors who play Van Helsing and Carl provide the voices for their animated counterparts which prevents the cartoon from being a complete waste of time. However, this was not directed by Stephen Sommers, but by former a story board artist, Sharon Bridgeman and it shows. The animation is stiff, but the backgrounds look good. The best thing about this DVD is the 30 minute feature on how they made the Van Helsing movie. It's far better then the cartoon. I can't recommend buying this DVD unless it's a freebie shrinked wrapped with the Van Helsing DVD when it's released. It's worth a rental  if you have a coupon for a free rental.",1084233600,10,1211,4.571428571428571

1989539,4,B0001CNRNY,"'Van Helsing - The London Assignment' is a good animated short feature that sets the stage for us the viewers for the live action 'Van Helsing'.  The film focuses in on Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and his bloody excapades through the night darkened streets of London.  Mr. Hyde is ""Jack The Ripper"" and he is killing young women and literally stealing their souls, their life essence as they die.  But for what purpose?

Good animated film.  This was back in a time that the studio's really rolled out the red carpet for a DVD release.  'Chronicles of Riddick' had 'Dark Fury', the video game 'Dead Space' had it's respective anime, as did 'Dante's Inferno'.  This was a time period not long ago that studio's would front the money for a supplemental project to help promote a feature film.  The main actors themselves, specifically Hugh Jackman even lend their voices to this animation.

Is this worth a buy?  At the extremely low price it's going for, YES.  Throw a copy in with your next Amazon order.  If you saw the feature length 'Van Helsing' but missed this short introductory piece, give it a shot, I believe you will like it.",1350950400,,1127,4.636363636363637
1989540,3,B0001CNRNY,"Direct-to-video sequels are one thing, but this is one of the few times I've ever heard of a direct-to-video prequel. Tracking this puppy down back in '04 proved problematic for some reason. First I tried Columbia House, from whom I've ordered a few DVDs (The Black Scorpion, Without a Clue, Eight Legged Freaks, and the complete first season of Jonny Quest, to name a few), but lo and behold, they were out of stock.

Despite being issued to stores in needlessly massive quantities, hunting down a copy of Van Helsing: The London Assignment at Wal-Marts across the county turned up nothing. Ultimately, I found one last copy remaining for sale at a Blockbuster. Now, all these years later, I'm wondering if it was worth it.

Jack-of-all-trades monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing is sent to London to get to the bottom of a string of gruesome murders that the Vatican is sure is being caused by some monstrous creature. With him is Carl, and together they discover that the killer is none other than Edward Hyde, the big, hairy, cigar-chomping alter-ego of Dr. Henry Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll, as it happens, is the personal physician to Queen Victoria, and he's turning himself into Mr. Hyde nightly and committing the murders as part of a scheme involving the Queen herself. Van Helsing must stop Jekyll and Hyde and save the Queen, but first he has to contend with the police, who think he is the murderer after he discovers the latest victim at the wrong place and the wrong time, not to mention the army of undead minions (mostly comprised of Yeomen Warders) that Hyde has created through a combination of mad science and black magic.

The animation is stellar throughout, and it's nice that most of the cast of Van Helsing are reprising their roles from the movie - David Wenham as Carl, Robbie Coltrane as Mr. Hyde, Alun Armstrong as Cardinal Jinette, and, remarkably, Hugh Jackman himself as Van Helsing himself. Missing, however, is Stephen H. Fisher as Dr. Jekyll, who didn't have any dialogue in the film anyway unless you count, ""Aahhhhh!"", which I don't; in any event, he's replaced by Dwight Schultz, who does a so-so job. It's also nice to see Tress MacNeille still doing voiceover work (she plays Queen Victoria).

But overall, that's all the good I can really say about Van Helsing: The London Assignment. The rest of the ""movie,"" which is only 33 minutes long (!), isn't worthy of any real praise aside from one or two scenes while I will go into a little more detail about.

We get no new insight into Van Helsing's character, for one thing: He's introduced to us already a member of the Knights of the Holy Order, already at odds with Cardinal Jinette, and already chummy with Carl. Even though I know that they didn't go into Van Helsing's backstory because that would've spoiled the movie (the theatrical one, I mean), it still bugs me. On the plus side, there's a pretty fun sequence showing him training by fighting against a bunch of surprisingly (i.e., improbably) mobile stuffed dummies representing werewolves, vampires, and other monsters, including one of Carl which is the obligatory ""defenseless hostage/innocent bystander"" Van Helsing ain't supposed to hurt but which gets an arrow between the eyes anyway, much to Carl's consternation.

There's also the fact that besides the thing with the dummy, Van Helsing doesn't seem to care if any innocent bystanders are hurt and/or killed, such as when he causes an entire train to crash in an attempt to kill Hyde, quite obviously killing the engineer(s) in the engine, and probably a lot of the passengers too. And neither he nor Carl seem concerned about it at all. It's true that prior to this Hyde had detached most of the passenger cars trying to ditch Van Helsing, but that doesn't change the fact that there had to have been someone riding in those first two cars, not to mention the guys driving the train.

As the main villain(s), Jekyll and Hyde are extremely frustrating. His/their scheme in and of itself is at least fairly interesting. Basically, if memory serves, Jekyll fell in love with Victoria when she was young. But now she's old. And, as Hyde, he's killing young women to create a youth potion for her. How ""in on it"" Victoria is, or isn't, is inconsistent; her mysteriously, pointlessly unreliable memory really got on my nerves. Is she somehow brainwashed by Jekyll? Or is she totally complicit? I honestly couldn't figure one way or the other.

It would've been nice to learn how and why Jekyll created the potion and began using it to turn himself into Hyde. And speaking of which, it's a pretty widely accepted that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are two different people who shared the same body, or at least two sides of the same person. Not so here. Here, when Jekyll turns into Hyde he's still pretty much the same guy; drinking the potion and transforming into Hyde is apparently just Jekyll's way of ""Hulking out,"" as it were, so that he can be faster, stronger, etc. This makes Van Helsing's remark in the movie about Jekyll being Hyde's ""better half"" somewhat erroneous. To say nothing of the fact this means Jekyll even changing his name makes no sense; he's still Jekyll when transformed so why the ""Edward Hyde"" moniker? It makes no sense in this context, except as an alias.

In fact, if Hyde were more of a mindless monster than he already is here, this version of Jekyll and Hyde would have a lot more in common with the Abbott and Costello version. Thankfully though, Mr. Hyde does have a lot of the malevolently playful personality he had in the movie: One blackly humorous scene has him lighting up a cigar by striking a match on his own face and going ""Oopsie!"" after hurling the body of a woman he just stabbed to death at Van Helsing, and his indifferent reaction to Carl in drag (don't ask!).

Aw, hell, I can't resist: Since all of the murder victims were female, Van Helsing has Carl dress up like a woman in the hopes of luring Hyde out. Speaking of which, much of the anachronistic humor on display here is quite annoying. It's one thing for Carl to curse and sleep with a beautiful peasant girl he's rescued and get away with it just because he's a friar and not a monk, but the inevitable, groan-inducing dialogue that comes as a result of him fussing over his appearance whilst in drag is just too much. It's even hinted at - quite strongly - that Carl has dressed in drag before in situations that don't call for it. Needlessly anachronistic comedy like this is nothing new with period pieces, but it felt especially forced and obnoxiously, uh, anachronistic here (can't ya just tell I love that word?).

And on a more personal note, I was also rather annoyed that we didn't get to see hardly any of the events referred to during Van Helsing's encounter with Hyde in Van Helsing. We see how he got the bullet wound in his arm, but, sadly, we don't get to see the other stuff they talked about, like the ""rather nasty massacre of poultry."" The mental image of Mr. Hyde tearing into a flock of chickens because of an intense KFC craving is so hilarious I'm honestly amazed they didn't bother to include it.

In conclusion, it comes as no surprise that Van Helsing: The London Assignment was nothing more than a half-assed attempt to promote the full-length film. However, unlike many such shameless promotions that try to pass themselves off as actual movies, this one gets brownie points for A), having surprisingly good animation, and B), involving most of the actors from the movie. Still, it makes Van Helsing look like Oscar-worthy material by comparison.",1339286400,,7576,4.705128205128205
1989541,4,B0001CNRNY,"Van Helseing--The London Assignment is a nicely done animated prequel to the film Van Helsing. At the start of the Van Helsing motion picture, our hero is pursuing the monster Mr. Hyde. The London Assignment, a short, sweet little animated film, shows us the rest of that story. Van Helsing and Friar Carl are sent to London to discover what evil is butchering young, beautiful ladies of the night, and leaving whitered corpses, as if their souls have been drained. There's a lot of the visual, sensual grisliness you find in graphic novels, plus the flowing anime style of art, adapted to a western european gothic theme. It's quite good, but the best part of the disc is the bonus features. There are interviews with all the principal actors of the motion picutre Van Helsing, and documentaries on the stunt rigging and action sequences. You'll be amazed how much of the action was NOT computer generated. You get to see the Frankenstein Monster out of makeup, and you will be surprised what he really looks like, I promise you--whether that's a thrill or a letdown only you can judge. Other features include the making of the Van Helsing video game, and storyboard art of the animated London Assignment film. If you are a student of film and animation, the bonus features will be especially satifying. If you are not, I believe you will still find them very cool.",1321574400,,1366,4.743697478991597

1989544,4,B0001CNRNY,"The Van Helsing movie opens with Van Helsing in a final battle with Mr. Hyde in Paris.  This short animated adventure tells you how he got to that point.  Van Helsing and Carl travel to London to investigate some sinister killings of young prostitutes.  But the chase leads to far more complex plots than just the killing on young women.

Van Helsing gets tied up in a plot that involved Dr. Jekyll who is physician to Queen Victoria.  The not-so-good doctor is obsessed with the Queen and has devised a plot to further his own ends with her.  As we know from the full-length movie, Mr. Hyde manages to get to Paris.  I won't reveal who the battles progress or the details of the plot but I found it to be rather entertaining.  Other than Mr. Hyde being huge (taken from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) unlike in Stevenson's book where Hyde is smaller than Jekyll, the story doesn't twist his tale as much as that of Dracula in the longer feature.

The animation is clean and the voices are true (Hugh Jackman and others from the feature film).  If you enjoyed the feature film then you are sure to enjoy this one as it is very true to the movie (other than Carl being in the field).  Check it out.",1168300800,,1205,4.407239819004525

1989547,1,B0001CNRNY,"Well, they did it with the Riddick series and it succeded, so I guess Universal decided it would work for Van Helsing as well.  This is one of the hugest pieces of crap I've ever seen make it to DVD.  Everything about it including the music and voices make it seem like some episode of a boring Saturday morning cartoon.  From the first minute of it I was wishing for it to be over, and when it was I was happier than ever.  If you didn't like the movie you'll probably hate this, likewise if you didn't like this but haven't seen the movie I doubt you'll like it either.  If you liked the movie and haven't seen this I can't guarantee you'll like this short.

In fact, I was searching Amazon for another movie that was perhaps released after the movie came out, as part of this animiated series.  Nothing yet, but we are waiting....patiently!  The Bonus Features were excellent -- it provided wonderful insight on the superb special effects of the Van Helsing movie -- we especially found the 'creation' of Dracula's brides quite interesting.  Now we have it all -- this show, the Van Helsing movie, the classic CDs (i.e., Dracula and Frankenstein) that came with the Ultimate Collectors Edition.

1989550,5,B0001CNRNY,"Well, there's nothing unusual about turning a reasonably successful film into the centerpiece of a marketing campaign. So, naturally, there will be a game, action figures, tee shirts, and this time there is even an animated half hour short.

The story this time is set as a prequel, although there really isn't anything that requires that you even know about the film. Prophecying the first 10 minutes of the film, this tidbit has the 'other' monster, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, walk out of Robert Louis Stevenson's pages and start hunting through London's streets (as a thinly disguised Jack the Ripper) stealing souls in order to restore Queen Victoria to her youth and make off with her. Van Helsing, of course, to the rescue.

The action is furious, with train chases (trains seem to play an important part in this), balloon rides, trips through the sewers and the dark streets of London. Blood flies, damsels are distresses (and slain), rooftops are leaps, and, in general, a good time was had by all. The dialog seems to be mostly quips, wisecracks, and growls, but action films never really are about verbal communications.

Animation is several notches above Snow White, but in some strange way the approach and animation style remind me of the Disney era more than they do of the Yu-Gi-Oh and Scooby era. For those of us spoiled by high end anime The London Assignment seems a bit dated artistically. So it's a good story with unexceptional artwork. And the wrong amount of violent - too graphic for the youngest audiences, and to lame for more mature viewers.

There is a very good 'making of the movie' film included, but otherwise the extras are lackluster. My overall feeling is that this is an entertaining 30 minutes to rent, but not really worth the cost of keeping it around.",1102464000,3,1786,4.807817589576548
1989551,4,B0001CNRNY,"Reminds me a lot of just about all superhero cartoons.  Interesting mixture of American animation and Japanese coloring and pencils, enhanced with computer animation (very cool!).  The story is a little stretched, and doesn't make much sense (concerning the reason Hyde would want to make the queen younger; hello, he's still an old fart headed to a grave), but it held my interest and was nicely traditional but original.

  The dialogue is usually pretty clever, even Hyde gets in a few funny lines.

  The action is refreshingly American, meaning no stupid ""action lines"" in the background, or still action.  Using Robbie Coltrane and Hugh Jackman (not to mention Dave Wenham) as primary voices  added star power, and Jackman does a good job (you can feel his voice and personality overtake the animated Van Helsing).

  The special features (including a making of the game featurette, which shows them converting the movie story to the game, and some sweet action scenes; a making of the movie featurette, which is good enough to be included on the motion picture itself, even if Josie Moran is extremely irratating; the animatics can only be appreciated by animators themselves).  The interviews with Hugh Jackman are a nice insight into the character of Van Helsing, as well as Jackman himself.  Interesting stuff, even if a little ""fluffy"", as one reviewer put it.

  Overall, worth at least a rental (I bought it).  A valuable addition to your collection of Van Helsing items, and fun to watch (over and over again in my case; 4 times in the rental period).",1101340800,12,1565,4.9272030651340994
1989552,3,B0001CNRNY,"""Van Helsing: The London Assignment"" is an animated prequel to the 2004 Universal film ""Van Helsing"" in the sense that what takes place happens before the film.  But it does not add anything to our understanding of Van Helsing and his mission beyond what we got from the movie.  Actually, the only thing that makes this a story that takes place before the movie is the character of Mr. Hyde.  Otherwise it could just as easily take place afterwards or be just another episode from ""Van Helsing: The Animated Series.""  Consequently, this animated short is okay but hardly seems worth the effort of getting the movie cast to show up and do the voices, although certainly their dedication to the project is appreciated.

The overblown story is what stands out the most.  Basically, Dr. Jekyll (voice of Dwight Schultz) wants to marry old Queen Victoria (voice of Tress MacNeille) so he turns into Mr. Hyde (voice of Robbie Coltrane) who is apparently doing the Jack the Ripper murders to get the life essences of his victims so that he can turn the queen into a young girl (voice of Tara Strong) who does not remember that she was married to Prince Albert and has scads of grandchildren.  Of course, Gabriel Van Helsing (voiced by Hugh Jackman) has all sorts of objections to this as a Knight of the Holy Order, so he is sent by the Vatican, along with his faithful monk companion, Carl (voice of David Wenham), to stop the murders and save the soul of the monster doing the crimes.  This is an interesting character point, not because of the religious ramifications, but more because it gives Van Helsing a reason not to just kill the monsters right away in the real world like he does in his practice sessions.

""Van Helsing: The London Assignment"" ends up coming across as a slightly above averaged animated cartoon, albeit with a lot more blood than you will find on television.  There is some computer generated images thrown in with the hand drawn animation, which only underscores the mishmash of anime styles.  The contrasts are interesting, but they stop the visual style from coalescing.  The bonus features end up being longer than the cartoon, which is where it becomes clear you are dealing with the Universal publicity department out to market ""Van Helsing"" for all it is worth.  There is a 28-minute featurette on the making of the film hosted by actress Josie Maran, a brief chat with Jackman on his character, a series of animatic to animation sequences, and even a look at the making of the Van Helsing video game.  Since there is a trailer for Universal's ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" and its own animated prequel you get the feeling Universal will be saddling up this particular pony for a lot of rides in the future.  I probably would have liked all of this more if it was not packaged separately from the film itself.",1098403200,3,2835,4.6875
1989553,2,B0001CNRNY,"At the end of this animated ""prequel"" Van Helsing remarks to the rescued damsel that their predicament ""wasn't so bad."" To which she replies ""I agree. It was worse.""

Ding ding ding! We have a winner!

In the early days of animation the studios would wash the cels so that they could be used again. This of course, destroyed millions of frames of classic animation art. Oh that this were possible in this case.

Van Helsing, voiced by Hugh Jackman who also played the character in the motion picture, is sent to London to track down a killer who's been offing young women. The madman turns out to be a Mr. Hyde (yep, that one) who's somehow bottling their life essences to restore Queen Victoria's youth and beauty so that he can marry her and live happily ever after with her in his fiery underground lair.

There's a lot of fighting and chasing and in the end Van Helsing saves the Queen and thwarts Jekyll/Hyde. Of course his wussy assistant is along for the ride and provides what I can only assume they intended to be comic relief.

I'd like to take this moment to point out that I am a man in his thirties with a wife, a son and a nice house in the suburbs and I realize that film was not made for me. But I think it's too violent in spots for the children it's obviously aimed at.

For example, a young woman is killed early on quite graphically and her body is shown limp with blood covering her newly slit throat. Needless to say I'm not recommending this one to parents.

The animation is serviceable at best and seems to reside somewhere between trying to be modern anime while trying to adhere to a 1970's Saturday morning cartoon budget. One exception being what appears to be some computer animation in the train sequence that's actually very good.

So what we've got here is a poorly produced commercial for the live action feature film that people are suckered into purchasing. The DVD includes a ""behind the screams"" look at Van Helsing, some fluffy interview material with Jackman telling you how great the movie is, and some promo stuff for the video game.

I'm waiting for the full-length movie to arrive from Netflix and I'll be posting a review soon. I can only hope that it doesn't live up to its prequel.",1097193600,7,2228,4.481481481481482
1989554,2,B0001CNRNY,"While some of the scenes were breath-taking, the animation beautiful, the action well-done, and the actors from the movie voiced their characters in this short, the plot and story were completely lacking.  It's like they were aiming for weird instead of cool and good.  The full length theater movie is much, much better.

1989555,3,B0001CNRNY,"I must admit I really admire Universal's comeback strategy of providing better marketing techniques.  I really enjoy these short films released at the same time of the movie.  However, I don't know why it's got to be so short.  Maybe a full 2 hour feature would make this a better dvd.  But then again, it's not expensive and I do own many 30 minute DVD's.  What I really enjoyed about this animated film was the just the true attempt to capture an adult audience.  Frankly, when you see American animation, it's always geared towards children.  The entire adult action market is owned and dominate by Japanese studios.

The fact that this film shows violence, a real adult plot, and even tie in's with the movie make it enjoyable.  Although I'm not one for vampire movies, and I'm probably not going to watch the Helsing movie, but the dvd?  Yes something I wanted to see and buy.  I also bought the Riddick Dark Fury dvd which was advertised heavily on this DVD.  The making of the movie and behind the scenes adds value to this DVD.  I really think that what Universal is doing is adding an entire new Genre to film.

If they continue to make short films simultaneous with their block buster releases, I can certainly see a new following for these DVDs.  But realistically I'll be waiting for a full budgeted 2 hour feature release of adult action animation.  That's when a real attempt should be interesting.",1090713600,3,1412,4.610441767068273

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The animation was better than I expected and much easier to watch than the animation in some of the segments of ""The Animatrix.""  I also was intrigued by the story of Van Helsing's struggle against Mr. Hyde.  It gave much needed background and meaning to the Paris chase sequence of the film and introduced viewers to Van Helsing's connection to Carl.  I really wish that I had seen ""The London Assignment"" before I saw ""Van Helsing"" in theaters.  However, the most enjoyable aspect of ""The London Assignment"" was the fact that the principal actors (Jackman, David Wenham, Robbie Coltrane) lent their voices to their respective characters.  The dialogue was similar to that in the movie, especially between Van Helsing and Carl. :-)
Also worth mentioning are the bonus features on the disc.  There is a fairly good making-of documentary that is approximately thirty minutes long.  It has plenty of snippets of cast/crew interviews.  There is a *very* brief (as in three-four minutes:-() interview of Hugh Jackman as well as another short documentary about the making of the ""Van Helsing"" video game.  The only truly ""London Assignment""-related bonus feature contrasts the early storyboard sketches with the final product.
Bottom Line:  Entertaining for Hugh Jackman fans and ""Van Helsing"" fans.  Definitely worth renting at least once, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it (well, not yet at least;-)).",1089072000,10,1628,5.007434944237918
1989557,4,B0001CNRNY,"VAN HELSING: THE LONDON ASSIGNMENT fills in the rest of the story that makes up the introductory sequence to the movie VAN HELSING. In this animated story, Van Helsing is sent to London to find out who is responsible for several recent killings of young women of the night. Van Helsing soon finds out that the killer is a brutish monster who calls himself Hyde who has some sort of connection to Queen Victoria's personal physician, the mysterious Dr. Jeckyl.  The Doctor is up to something no good and Van Helsing is going to find out exactly what.
VAN HELSING: THE LONDON ASSIGNMENT is not a cartoon meant for the really young. It shows a lot of violence and includes some sexual induendo. Were it a live action piece, it would garner a PG-13 movie rating.
When viewing the piece as a whole, it seems somewhat choppy and spliced together as though it were a television show.  Which in fact is what this animated feature is intended to be.  THE LONDON ASSINGNMENT isn't just a prequel to the successful movie, it's also the pilot for a planned animated series.
The DVD includes several extra features: a ""Behind the Scenes"" look at the movie, movie storyboards for the animated story, a making of look at the animated story, and a making of look at the Van Helsing video game. The extra features might not seem like much, but for a 33 minute cartoon, it's quite a lot of stuff. Overall, a nice gift for anyone who likes VAN HELSING.",1085356800,6,1433,4.546511627906977
1989558,1,B0001CNRNY,"Not a bad animated film but it only lasts about 40 mins. in my opinion it should have been included on the Van Helsing motion picture DVD as a bonus feature, that would have impressed. but no! it's marketed as a spin off. it is far to overpriced for a short cartoon.",1085184000,4,266,4.134615384615385
1989559,4,B0001CNRNY,"I rented the DVD so I'm not overly disappointed in my money spent. The animation is actually quite nice, and the motifs vaguely reminiscent of Batman and Vampire Hunter D (the whole Van Helsing franchise rips Amano's D off quite blatantly).
My only problem is the length, which affects the overall pacing of the action. This could have been a great episode if it were part of a TV series. I doubt that will happen.

On the positive side, I really enjoy hearing Hugh Jackman reprising his role via voice. I just wished the creators produced a series of stories based in London.",1412985600,,311,4.473684210526316
