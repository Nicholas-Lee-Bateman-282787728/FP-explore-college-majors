6451944,5,B00KW02JRK,"On September 9, 2014 just a mere four months that ""Dynasty-Season 8"" was released Paramount will put ""Dynasty's"" final season on DVD! This is remarkable in the fact that fans here in North America have been waiting patiently for all of the series' episodes on DVD as the rest of the world had them long before we ever did.

 Season 9 began in the fall of 1988 and there were many changes awaiting the soap opera. Gone were Jack Coleman as Steven left Denver to start a new life; Linda Evans only agreed to appear in the first handful of shows as she stated , ""I wanted my life back"", and Joan Collins was told she would appear in 13 out of the 22 episodes as producers stated to her , ""We can't afford to pay you for every episode"" (Collins was making $60,000 a show).

 The best news was the addition of Stephanie Beacham as Sable Colby (Alexis' cousin from the ill-fated ""The Colbys"" who once remarked to Alexis, ""Our Mommies were sistas"". We also saw Fallon revert back to her sexy old ways as she was involved with a sexy police officer while pursuing Jeff from Sammy Jo.

 ABC wanted ""Dynasty"" killed and since the ratings remained respectable in the previous three seasons and the show was still surviving the new guys at the head of the network decided to really ax it by airing it on Thursday nights opposite the #1 show in the country ""Cheers"". Ratings fell to all-time lows (even lower than the first season) and in March, 1989 ABC announced ""Dynasty"" was cancelled. Before the cancellation it was still not clear if ABC would renew the series (there was speculation the network would). Joan Collins told producers she would not return for another year and Alexis would be ""killed off"" and Diahann Carroll would return as Dominique as the shows new villain.

 The final episode was filled with surprises so I won't tell you how it ends, but Alexis' demise is almost certain!.

 As of this writing there is no word if ""Dynasty-The Reunion"" or ""The Colbys"" will ever see the light of day on DVD. Due to the terrible writing of the mini-series and the bad reception it had and the fact ""The Colbys"" is hardly remembered only by ardent fans like myself I doubt this will happen, but who knows.

 Thank you Paramount for releasing my favorite prime time soap of all-time in its entirety on DVD...we ""Dynasty"" fans appreciate it!

UPDATE!!!!! January 27, 2015:  Some special news for all ""Dynasty"" fans. I thought this would never become a reality, but it has. Shout! Factory has announced that on May 12, 2015 ""The Colbys-The Complete Series"" will be released on DVD. We will get All two seasons worth of shows (as that is the longest the series ran for from 1985-1987) and features 49 uncut episodes plus interviews with John James (Jeff), Max Caulfield (Miles) and the beautiful Stephanie Beacham (Sable). I am doing handstands! Remember also that many ""Dynasty"" stars made special appearances on ""The Colbys"" like John Forsythe. Gordon Thompson and Diahann Carroll as the shows stories often intermingled. ENJOY!!!! Also, no news yet if ""The Colbys"" box set will be released in other parts of the world, but news of that will be placed here if that happens.",1402531200,35,3165,4.638640429338103
6451945,5,B00KW02JRK,"I bought this DVD because It was $1.99 an episode for this season. Now that I'm ready to watch it, it's free with my Prime of course. After I finish the show I'll have something I don't need. It is beautifully packaged for the GRANDE FINALE! It all comes down to this Season (and ""Dynasty: The Reunion"" which Amazon hopefully will release on streaming or DVD! Maybe Shout Factory will release that! It's so much fun to watch Dynasty ALL the through from Season 1 to Season 9. I even bought ""The Colbys"" DVD. I couldn't watch it, but I understand when the characters go back and forth between shows at least.",1492646400,,607,4.428571428571429

6451956,5,B00KW02JRK,"These came in very fast and work perfect.
I got hooked on the series while watching them on Amazon Prime.  I liked the series enough to want to finish it.  Sadly when I got to the last season, Amazon didn't offer them free for prime members, it was going to cost me $1.99 an episode.  I decided it would be cheaper to purchase the dvds.  I will eventually buy the whole series on DVD.
The play back has really been good and I have nothing negative to say about their functioning.
Sadly I can see why this show came to the end. I preferred the first half of the series as opposed to the last half.  I also wish I could find a copy of the Dynasty Reunion to buy.  I have not finished this set of DVDs so far, so hope there is a bit of closure without needing the reunion.",1467590400,,769,4.026315789473684

I'm glad Stephanie Beacham reprised her role as Sable from the Colbys (I hope The Colbys will be released on DVD as well), especially with the mid-season departure of Linda Evans as Krystle. I wasn't too fond of Dex's portrayal this season, yet I enjoyed the main plot that reached into the show's established history from Season 1.

As the 80s came to a close, so does Dynasty. It leaves the air with glamor, style, and something not seen in today's TV: cliffhangers! I also hope Dynasty: The Reunion comes to DVD to wrap up the series.",1417478400,3,597,4.477064220183486

It has always been my favorite nightime serial. Highly reccommended. Now we need the DVD release of the Dynasty Mini-series that tied up some loose ends left dangling in the season 9 finale. Perhaps they were not aware ABC would cancel Dynasty. Also The spin-off serial from Dynasty The Colbys needs to be released on DVD. It is very nice to get Dynasty released on DVD.

6452019,2,B00KW02JRK,"As a completist, I'm glad this final year will be released. However, be forewarned: this season is like a post-mortum postcard from a beloved family member, or worse, like watching a loved one on life support slipping slowly away.

--First, the writing is flacid and uninspired (Nazi treasure, really?); it feels more like you're watching ""Passions."" An example of the sloppy writing concerns off-screen character Roger Grimes, a second-season plot device who is completely reshuffled and badly re-inserted into the proceedings with a different history.

--Second, Joan Collins was only in every-other show--a machination designed to get out of paying her full salary (as she was paid per episode, this would essentially cut her salary in half).

--Third, Linda Evans couldn't abandon this sinking ship fast enough, leaving the show a quarter of the way through the season.

--Finally, a great, entertaining show goes out given such an ignominious boot--like a stake through the heart of a pesky vampire.

By the way, the price of the DVD set is outrageous and exploitative: one last kick in the groin to the fans. They could have at least included the final movie and the reunion show as extras to offset the weakness of the material.

Truthfully, the show had begun a steady downward spiral after the sixth season, when talent was syphoned-off, both in front of and behind the camera, for ""Dynasty II: The Colbys;"" but, it deserved a better end than this.  On a positive note, at least you get to see these beloved characters embodied one last time; but, don't expect much more than that.",1409270400,9,1590,4.977358490566037
6452020,3,B00KW02JRK,By the time the ninth season came around I had stopped watching but hope to buy this to complete the collection.,1406246400,2,112,4.380952380952381
6452021,5,B00KW02JRK,"""Mrs. Carrington hasn't been herself in years!"" a maid states emphatically during the first episode of Season 9.

Indeed. And Krystle Carrington was a metaphor for the show as a whole.

The show had been spiraling for several years due to jaw-droppingly childish writing, and the producers seemingly remained unaffected by criticism from the fans, media pundits or crashing Nielsen numbers.

Finally, Aaron Spelling hired David Paulsen, perhaps DALLAS' most inspired constructionist, to take over Season 9 of DYNASTY to fix it.

And fix it he did, although it was much too late to save DYNASTY from the axe (ABC had already earmarked it for cancellation and moved it to a dead end timeslot -- with almost no promotion -- to kill it).

Some questioned at the time: are they bringing in a new producer at the last minute to take the blame?

In any event, the writing improves dramatically with Season 9, the muddled narrative and clunky execution that began in Season 3 and stumbled thru Season 8 has been arrested, and we're given an inspired, focused final season.

And thank goodness. If only S3 thru S8 had made this much sense. :(

Visually, the Region 1 DVD quality has been much better for DYNASTY. So even though the price it a bit high, the ""look"" and the story quality for Season 9 is worth it.",1405382400,,1302,4.704845814977974
6452022,5,B00KW02JRK,"Well, after 220 episodes and tons of cat fights, great and not-so-great stories and with more parents naming their baby girls Alexis or Krystal in the 1980's ""Dynasty"" came to an end because ABC wanted it off the air. By putting it against the NBC comedy series ""Cheers"" this really put a nail in the soap operas coffin. Still, these last 11 shows are some of the best episodes in ""Dynasty's"" history and I won't give you any spoilers. But the last show is full of surprises.

 Here are the last 11 show's episodes and their air dates:

12. ""All Hands on Dex"", Feb. 16, 1989
13. ""Virginia Reels"", Feb. 23, 1989
14. ""House of the Falling Son"", March 2, 1989
15. ""The Son Also Rises"", March 16, 1989
16. ""Grimes and Punishment"", March 23, 1989
17. ""Sins of the Father"", March 30, 1989
18. ""Tale of the Tape"", April 6, 1989
19. ""No Bones About It"", April 13, 1989
20. ""Here Comes the Son"", April 27, 1989
21.  ""Blast From the Past"", May 4, 1989
22.  ""Catch 22"", May 11, 1989",1403049600,,971,4.313186813186813
6452023,5,B00KW02JRK,"In Part 1 of the final season of ""Dynasty"" many changes occurred on the once famous prime time serial: Linda Evans would leave at the beginning of the year and Steven (played by Jack Coleman) had left town. Season 9 also featured the arrival of the wonderful and eccentric Sable (Stephanie Beecham) who snarled to Alexis, ""Our Mommies were sistas!"".

 This may have been the final year of ""Dynasty"" (although it did come back as a terrible four hour mini series in 1991 on ABC), but the writing was top notch and the acting as great as ever. Some fans even refer to the final year as being one of the show's best.

 Last episode solves nothing of the stories and all questions are transferred to the 1991 reunion show.
 Unfortunately this is not released yet.
 Hope it will be released one day along with THE COLBYS series...",1402617600,15,289,4.519230769230769
