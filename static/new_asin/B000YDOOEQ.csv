3026466,1,B000YDOOEQ,"a horrible movie, the plot & acting sucks, there's only 1 dragon in it & he's only in it for 4 of the last 10 minutes, there's just to mcuh wrong with, lets just say it was like a sci-fi channel original movie with a slightly higher budget, I even recognized 1 of the locations from a sci-fi channel dragon movie",1194393600,,312,4.131147540983607
3026467,1,B000YDOOEQ,"This was terrible. When I saw the previews all I thought about was the animation, and how good it
 was. The animation was good, I'll say that much about it. The rest was horrid. I saw the film with my mom, three minutes into it we turned to each other and she asked if I wanted to go. I wanted to see if it got better, it didn't.

For one the plot had been done billions of times before, and was totally dull. It was like a sad combination of Star Wars and Jurassic park. One of the enimies (Of which there were too many) talked in a pathetically low voice and was unbeatable except when he was hit by a car. The ""bad"" snake, which sadly wasn't even a dragon got within and inch of getting the good guys, then stopped dead, screamed for a minute or so letting its prey get away before chasing after. The ""good"" snake doesn't show up until the very end, so we barely even see it.

There was one part to this movie that was decent, when the guy with the low voice walks through a wall, and a little old lady tries to follow after and bumps into it. At the end when a dragon finally appears it is awsome-looking, but hangs around way too long, so you're just wondering when the dumb movie will be over.

Please do not waste your time or money on this, unless you like wasting time or money.",1194048000,,1287,4.095238095238095
3026468,1,B000YDOOEQ,"Here's a piece of advice: if you have a movie called ""Dragon Wars,"" it's probably not a good idea to save the dragon footage for the last five minutes. The rest of the film does showcase a number of other creatures, such as winged dinosaur-hybrids and things that vaguely resemble rhinos. We even get to see gigantic snakes that have the potential to become dragons. But where are the actual dragons? Why keep us waiting until the end? This is but one example of how hopelessly incompetent this film is; ""Dragon Wars""--or ""D-War,"" or whatever it's called--is an attempt but not an actual end result, an absolute mess filled with unconvincing special effects, horrendous performances, and a plot I neither understood nor cared about.

The film opens with a Los Angeles news reporter named Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) trying to get the latest scoop on an explosion. Not much is known about what happened; all anyone can determine is that a gigantic, odd-looking animal scale is found under the soil. From what animal, no one knows. But whatever it comes from, seeing it triggers a number of flashback sequences, the first of which takes place fifteen years ago, when Ethan was only a boy. He and his father enter a local antique shop and meet Jack (Robert Forester), the elusive owner. He notices a strange sight; as Ethan approaches a wooden chest, it opens and reveals a brilliant white light. This signals to Jack that Ethan a destined young boy.

With me so far? Because it only gets worse from here. After sending the father away (by faking a heart attack and begging for help), Jack tells Ethan of an ancient myth that dates back to sixteenth-century Korea. Apparently, titanic serpents called Inoogi are destined to become dragons. For its good deeds, an Inoogi is rewarded--it joins with the soul of a Yuh Yi Joo, after which it ascends to heaven. A Yuh Yi Joo, by the way, is a special girl born once every 500 years--she's recognizable because she has a red dragon tattooed on her left shoulder. Anyway, evil serpents called Buraki have always tried to stop Inoogi from ascending, and they use their minions to find the Yuh Yi Joo and destroy her. Such was the destiny of a young Korean girl back in the 1500s; she fell in love with the guard sworn to protect her, meaning she failed to meet with her destiny. Both the Inoogi and the Buraki remain roaming the earth, waiting for the next Yuh Yi Joo to be born.

I apologize for rambling, but I'm trying to make sense of this story. There's no reason why a ninety-minute film has to have this much crammed into it, especially since none of it is of any interest. If they wanted an escapist film, then they should have made an escapist film; forget the complex details and just give us something entertaining. You'd think that such a convoluted back-story would add a little something, but no, it doesn't. If there's a point to this film, then I have no idea what it is.

But back to the plot. As a boy, Ethan was told that the next Yuh Yi Joo will be a girl named Sarah, and at age twenty, she'll be old enough to converge with the Inoogi. He was also told that he must find and protect her, no matter what. He's then given a special talisman (what makes it special is anyone's guess). Now as an adult, Ethan uses his reporter's skills to track Sarah down; by ""reporter's skills,"" I mean he has his monotone assistant, Bruce (Craig Robinson), do the work for him. This is when we finally meet Sarah (Amanda Brooks), a pretty young girl who was born with a red dragon tattooed on her left shoulder. After seeing news footage of Ethan at the explosion site, she begins to feel funny, as if she knows something terrible is going to happen. Of course, no one believes her, and she soon finds herself locked in a psychiatric ward.

The Buraki, meanwhile, is loose and hot on her trail. I don't bother questioning how it manages to find her, but I do wonder how an 800-foot long snake can go unnoticed until it attacks. How can something so large slither around buildings, over rooftops, and through streets without making even the tiniest noise? Never mind--the point is that it's after Sarah, and Ethan has to protect her from it. Through a series of laughably preposterous circumstances, they find each other and escape from the hospital. After battling the Buraki atop the Federal Building in Downtown Los Angeles, they witness the climactic fight between the Buraki and the Inoogi.

The FBI gets involved about halfway through the film, and at that point, my interest had completely faded. For reasons never adequately explained, they know everything about the dragons and Sarah. They also think that killing Sarah is the only solution to the problem. I wanted to tell these people that another problem exists, one that's even bigger than feuding dragons. The movie itself is the problem; ""Dragon Wars"" is mind-numbingly bad, the kind of bad that wouldn't even give rise to a cult classic. I wasn't expecting great cinematic art, but at the very least, the filmmakers could have tried to make a fun movie. After all, I just wanted to see some dragons. Was that too much to ask?",1193875200,35,5133,4.635164835164836

3026470,4,B000YDOOEQ,"I love this movie. It's 90 minutes of goofy fun. The effects are decent enough, and the cast chews up the scenery. The story is just enough to get you from one effects-laden scene to another. Don't look for deep meaning just sit back and turn off your brain for awhile.",1480464000,,269,4.294117647058823

3026472,4,B000YDOOEQ,"A bit of a western centric casting with a script style that is pure Asian.  The comic relief is subtle but it is there.  The SFX as as integral to the movie as any Kaiju tale should be.
This is a movie that takes a classic Asian (Korean I think) folk tale and gives it a current times reincarnation.  Such Asian folklore tales are not often understood at all by U.S. audiences that have never been exposed to culture from anywhere but the Hollywood media machine.  The doing a modern take on an old folk tale is a difficult proposition at best.  If you do a period piece; mode film makers have no clue about older cultures and put in so many anachronisms it crosses the line to total eff-up the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy fiction..  (Crowd at joust singing ""We will, we will, rock you"" was the kind of joke that ruined the flow of the story so bad that the whole crowd watching the movie on DVD went to fix popcorn at the same time.)
  I give this one 4 out of 5 for entertainment value.  For what it is; well done.  Very enjoyable.  The mix of styles and tropes was just a bit jarring in the edit so I couldn't go for 5 of 5 for excellence in folk tale modernization.  (The historic exposition at the beginning with the Hong Kong mythic action movie feel clashed with the Kaiju invasion feel of the bulk of the movie.  There are more movie tropes in Asian cinema than ""Kung Fu Action Movie"" and Godzilla)
  I actually bought this movie on Blu-Ray based on a passing mention of liking the movie by a Youtube movie reviewer,  Comic Book Girl 19 (her youtube channel name) pegged it.  Fun Asian cinema and well worth watching.",1471132800,,1640,4.324590163934427
3026473,3,B000YDOOEQ,"Lots of reviews here so I'll just say it was OK.

The effects were excellent. Too bad I can't say the same for the plot. Just a ridiculous premise. They couldn't find anybody better than some stupid teenager to be the protector? I guess they just didn't care. The special effects were terrific for a lower budget movie. Watching stuff like this always makes me wonder what Hollywood studio's spend all their money on.

3026491,5,B000YDOOEQ,"Before I started this review, I looked at some of the other reviews; some liked it some did not.  I LOVED IT!  The special effects were outstanding, the story line ok and the cast was good.  What was excellent was the action, especially the war zone in downtown Los Angelesl.  Now I live in NY
(Staten Island) so I didn't mind seeing LA getting  mushed up with tanks, gigantic dirty snakes and lots of mini dragons!!  And I don't remember
seeing so many cars getting mangled!  Yes, there was a dark Vader like evil  wizard-like person and lots of Asian Cylon like solders running amok
through Hollyweird and lots of gooey looking monsters with some kind of cannon devices attached to their backs.  And yes, the acting was just
so so, but the movie was very entertaining, violent yet without unnecessary gore that is in some movies (& TV).  But it had an interesting story
combining Asian mythology and conventional nasty dragons.  The big dragon at the end was an Asian conception, with four legs, fire breather,
but with the worm like body of the East ideas.  And the girl sacrificed herself to save the human race.  Some parts were funny, but the visuals
were just outstanding; this could not be a cheap, cheesy, low budget film; must of had a substantial budget.  I would not call this a children's film;
too violent and too hard for them to follow the story.  And the first part of the film was a little sluggish, but it got much better later.  The music
was fine, especially at the end.  The producers probably spent more money on port-a-potties than Ed Wood spent on all his cheesy dramas!
I give this beauty FIVE STARS; just fun entertainment!  I got this from Amazon, where else?  Enjoy this visual masterpiece.",1426550400,2,1719,4.595394736842105

I thought the CGI effects were really good.  The critters looked believable and whoever had done the drawings of the dragon(s) flying really did their homework.

The ""Imoogi"" were especially good, and I think that most of the CGI's were as good as any of the major Sci-Fi Classics, but the Elephant Rocket Launchers were ridiculous.  The Army Tanks should of taken a lot more of them out. The Helicopters vs the Flying Dragons were good. The music score was very good also.

The effects for their movement and the fighting between them and the locals is nice, but the dialogue and storyline is cheesy, badly acted, and over dramatized to a point of making me want to turn the movie off more than once on the first watch, and I haven't worked myself up to a second go around. I may just end up giving it away. It arrived quickly and well enough on that end.",1378425600,,450,4.244186046511628

3026539,4,B000YDOOEQ,"The director, Korea's most popular comedian, decided to realize his dream of making a high-tech sci-fi/fantasy film with a budget Hollywood would scoff at. His sincerity and years of intense effort paid off. He took a Korean legend, added to it, and went to several big shot American effects people, soundtrack writers, sound man, and the City of Los Angeles, asking them to help him make this film. He wanted it to be the best and most expensive sci-fi/fantasy film Korea had ever made, and the clips he showed in the U.S. convinced the people he needed to help him for a fee WAY below their usual. He built his own studio, invited experts and amateurs alike to help him put this together, and he realized his dream. The animatronic creatures (more than just dragons here!), CGI and miniature buildings are really well done. No, it doesn't look like a Godzilla film! The American actors (most of the cast, and it was made in English) are not all that scintillating, and the details of the storyline are a little shaky here and there. But all-in-all, I enjoyed the film and recommend it. The first part is a bit slow, but once the dragons and other creatures are released, it's great fun. How the director ever talked the city of L.A. to allow him to film tanks in the street after 9/11 is a mystery to me and, judging from the bonus feature, to the director, but he did it! I particularly like the giant snake-like dragon climbing up and around a skyscraper.

3026543,4,B000YDOOEQ,"I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this movie a comedy.  Yes, there are strained attempts at humor that fall flat, but that in itself is not enough to suppose the whole wreck can be excused away as a well-meaning chuckle.  I think the filmmakers fully intended to make an action/fantasy film that was meant to be taken seriously.  The results though, are quite another matter.  This movie is literally all over the place, complete with a false start, a trek back in time, reincarnation, and prehistoric creatures galore.  Precious little of this makes any sense.  It doesn't help that confusion appears to be part of the filmmaker's strategy.  Scenes are purposely kept brief, barely taking the time to establish what is going on before jumping across town or skipping merrily from one day to the next in the blink of an eye.  There are even several faux scenes that turn out to be mere dreams.  Good grief, the main character goes from a boy with blue eyes to an adult with brown eyes in a close-up no less!  A lot of this movie is just weird.  One minute it's like something out of Star Wars, then it borrows from Godzilla, it even has a berserk killer fed (Chris Mulkey)!  I think gratuitous best explains the direction this film takes.  It's outrageous, nonsensical, and oddly short at only 90 minutes.  And yet, for all its shortcomings, or because of them, I actually liked this movie.  I'm still trying to figure out how or why I do, I just do.  (Maybe because it suffers from the ugly puppy syndrome.  Someone has to like the poor thing, it's ugly............but it's a puppy.)",1357516800,,1590,4.561837455830389

3026547,1,B000YDOOEQ,"Some movies start with shaky acting and plot setup, and then improve. However, I am very thankful that I did not pay anything to see this movie; I saw it on Crackle. The longer I watched, the more I kept thinking, ""It's got to get better."" But my final thought was, ""Why? Why did I bother?""

The computer generated creatures in this dog were amazing, rivaling those of much bigger star power and box office success. And, the cast included some decent actors but, alas, even they could not rescue the sophomoric script. More to the point, I wonder what the actors or their agents were thinking when they accepted a role in this thing. I'm reminded of something I read recently that said there wasn't any role Liam Neeson would turn down. (I don't necessarily agree with that statement, but it illustrates my point.)

Perhaps some reviewers here on Amazon are referring to something else when they say this was a good movie. IMHO, it's not even worth renting, unless your interest is solely in visual production, in which case you might be better served to turn down or mute the volume . . . and leave the subtitles off.",1355097600,,1118,4.557213930348259

CGI makes even low budget effects look decent and this is no exception. The movie on the whole has the quality level of a made for sci-fi channel flick. It's ok for a rainy afternoon where your outdoor plans fall through but I wouldn't ever PLAN to watch a movie of this calibre. I didn't pause this movie when I got up fro a drink or bio break... I just didn't care enough about it and didn't want it to last longer than necessary. Don't pay more than a few bucks to watch this thing.",1319846400,,643,4.504273504273504
3026553,3,B000YDOOEQ,"Whether you see this movie as a huge joke or a serious effort it has its entertainment value from multiple perspectives. I was not offended by the acting, especially when compared to some I've seen recently; the story was convoluted but with some familiar overtones.

About three quarters of the way through I realized that I had seen it before a long time back but had mostly forgotten about it; the ending finally jarred my memory and helped me confirm this was the second time I'd seen it. It brings in a lot of Eastern mysticism including reincarnation so you have to go with the flow on a number of levels to enjoy the movie.

If you're willing to accept the basic assumptions of the movie it provides an evening's entertainment that isn't too shabby. The CGI is good and the sound is adequate so it's best to just sit back and let the story flow around you; if it makes you laugh that's good too.",1318204800,,902,4.427710843373494

I once watched a theatrical release of a movie about professional bodybuilding, written by and acted in by professional body builders. That movie hurt my brain so deeply I still have scars. Honestly I've been forced to sit through episodes of Power Rangers with better acting and more cohesive dialogue than this film. But my boys (11 and 5) loved this.

And of course what better way to do it then with monster movies.  Romance, drama and political thrillers are hard to produce for audiences of different cultures.  But monster movies are easy.  Starting with ""The Host"" several years back, S. Korea follows up with Dragon Wars.  Based loosely on Korean legend, as the movie tells it, the storyline is transplanted to modern-day Los Angeles.  The movie features great special effects, great battle scenes between supernatural soldiers and the US Army, and the bad dialog, mediocre acting and illogical scenes common to many monster movies.  For example, the bad dragon has an incredible ability to race down streets faster than a speeding car.  Yet in scene after scene, the hero and heroine just manage to escape on foot.  How nice!

The story is a loosely strung together tale of fate that links a man and a woman in a struggle to defeat evil in the form of a 200-meter-long snake. To defeat it they must follow in the footsteps of their ancestors (a kind of 'history repeats itself' motif) and perform the right actions this time or else the evil...snake...(boy does that sound lame) will continue to wreak havoc in future generations to come. What better way than to summon a GOOD 200-meter-long snake that will defeat the evil one. Hardly a thrilling story line.

On top of this is the horrendously poor acting. A side character plays a better role than the two main ones. The script is poorly delivered and made to sound hokey and lame. What should be terrifying is laughable. Failure has truly reached its summit with this film and if I had the option to give this movie no stars I would.

Acting (by the humans) is, honestly, down to 1-2 stars (at most) and the story is quite (un)believable. But that's cool. We're here to see L.A. go to dust!

The story is about a young boy that has the power to reveal the contents of an ancient box and gains the trust of an old wizard who tells him a story of another time. As the story unfolds a reporter is trying to find out about some odd ocurrences taking place in Los Angeles. Although it jumps between the current and ancient it actually is interesting if you sit back and just soak it in without being judgemental. If Shim claimed it did not have any comedy in it I would disagree, but if he said it was not a comedy I understand, because it isn't a comedy.

I fancy myself the type of person who enjoys a terrible film from time to time, e.g., The Ice Pirates.  I typically find them fun, simply due to their silliness. Dragon wars is not that type of bad movie.

Some movies are so bad they are good. Dragon Wars is so bad, it is terrible.  Never have I wanted to smash a t.v. set out of pure rage, but this movie caused it time and time again.  Far too much of the movie is boring exposition, which somehow manages to fail at its simple job of setting up the ridiculous plot.

From a tranquil Korean village lost in the centuries of time to a modern metropolis, the Story of Buraki and the Good Imoogi unfold.  This is the story of two ancient Korean serpents who sought the Yeouiju, a mystical orb from heaven which would transform one of the serpents into a dragon.

You have the love story of Ethan and Sarah which began in that Korean village when they first faced their destiny as young lovers, Haram and Narin.  Unfortunately, their decision to defy their destinies ended in tragedy and allowed Buraki time to create an invincible army.

The war between good and evil waged as Ethan and Sarah fought to survive.  Finally, the epic, climactic battle between Buraki and the Good Imoogi came down to Ethan's bravery and Sarah's ultimate sacrifice.

In the end as Ethan watches the Celestial Dragon ascend to the heavens, he says good bye to Narin, his true love and Bochun, his old master and friend.  Now, he faces his destiny alone for the first time.

Hyung Rae Shim wrote and directed this film.  Steve Jablonsky composed the musical score.

So I rented it with a couple of friends and we all watched it with the mindset of seeing a spectacularly entertaining trainwreck, and you know what?

It was EXACTLY as bad as we were hoping it to be.

Simply put, this is our generations ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""  It is so completely inept that it works brilliantly as an unintentional comedy.

In short, this movie has absolutely no redeeming cinematic value, and that's exactly why I can't recommend it enough, its that awesomely bad.

Just a splash of occasional romance completes an interesting movie that would be a good companion to Cloverfield. CGI effects are effective and actually much better than some more highly reviewed recent films. The battle of downtown LA was particularly well executed.

3026601,5,B000YDOOEQ,"I think that most reviewers seem to be missing the point that a new form of cinematic art has been coming into existence in the last forty years. It can best described as the Heroic Fantasy Epic.  Of course, it has been around in literature for a long time, but only in the last forty years have movie makers begun developing the tools to produce the effects needed to bring these stories to life.  It requires believable creatures that cannot possibly be represented by human actors or animals in costume and makeup.  It requires a beleivable representation of magic on a huge scale.  And, it requires an audience that is willing to accept that the ""real"" physical world we see around us is not the only possible world, and that it is possible for an intelligent, imaginative person to create  a fictional world where some of the laws of science as we know it do not necessarily apply.
This is such a movie.  It is complete fantasy and, as such, many of the rules of logic that govern other genres do not apply.  It is not necessary that the character of the Hero be fully developed.  It is sufficient that his intentions are Good and that he is brave and reasonably likeable.  Of course, it is much better if he is a fully rounded character and that his feelings be well expressed, but he is really a symbol for the forces of Goodness and, therefore need not be too carefully drawn.  Likewise, The villain is only a symbol for the forces of Evil, so he can be even less well defined.  In the same vein, the Deus Ex Machina is a perfectly acceptable device to bring about the destruction of the forces of Evil, since it is a major belief in almost every major religion that a human being alone is not capable resisting true Evil and that faith in, or the grace of, some deity is absolutely needed to overcome that Evil.
In essence the plot of an Epic fantasy is basically a form of melodrama.  First, the Hero is introduced, along with the Heroine and the rest of the Good people.  Then the Villain enters, usually disguised (thinly) as a good person. The Villain then gathers his henchmen secretly while gaining the confidence of the good people and tricking them into doing things that will later put them completely in his power.  The Hero usually suspects the Villain but he is not believed until it is too late and the Villain has sprung his trap.  When the trap is sprung, the good people try to resist, but to no avail, the villain has them trapped and helpless.  Meanwhile, the Hero perseveres and eventually finds the Villains weakness.  He confronts the villain and foils his plan, but the villain has foreseen this and responds with brute force. The good people dispair, but the Deus Ex Machina intervenes and the Villain is driven off. the good people celebrate.  Not every Fantasy follows this plot exactly, but in almost every case the Villain menaces, The Hero resists, and Goodness wins in the end, no matter how dark the outcome appears to be at the end of the next-to-last scene.
This movie is a fantasy epic.  If you follow the directors comments in the special features, you will know that it was built around some of the best special effects and CIG work I have ever seen. Once once he had that, the director took them and his script to Hollywood and recruited actors, sound designers, and a composer. The characters are not well developed because the movie is so packed with action that there is no time to waste on expressing the feelings or opinions of the cast.  There is no time to show the developing love story of the hero and heroine, so the narrator simply tells you that they fell in love and they then react to the events as a person in love would.
I loved this movie.  Yes, it has some flaws, but they are overshadowed by the hard work and effort that the makers put out to bring it forth. If you examine all the great classic movies of all time, they all had their flaws.  But what made them great was that they grabbed your attention and kept you watching in spite of it. This movie does just that. You are swept from one action to the next without a pause for breathe.  You don't miss the love scenes because you know that If the charactors had stopped moving long to make love, they would have been killed or eaten.  In the final analysis, this is a well-crafted action adventure filled with exceptinally good special effects and backed with an excellent musical score.  The sound effects are just as good as the outstanding visual effects.  Ignore the critics, sit back and enjoy the story and you'll have a good time.",1233878400,4,4557,4.493333333333333
3026602,1,B000YDOOEQ,"A few months ago, my teen kids and I stumbled across this and were intrigued by the straight-from-a-young boy's-imagination description on the back of the dvd box, especially this jewel: ""giant lizards with missile launchers."" Still, not having that much disposable income, I decided against it. Months later, Christmas morning, my kids gave it to me as something of a joke gift.

It isn't that the armed lizards weren't in it, but it was just so insipid, so poorly written and acted, and so entirely reliant on CGI effects that we found nothing to convince us not to take it back for a trade-in. You know a movie is bad when it fails to live up (or down) to even the most jaded movie fan's low standards. This movie had the overall feel of a bad tv show, or more accurately, a long, unending toy commercial (figures sold separately). I'd rather sit through episodes of The Land of the Lost until I went insane than watch this terrible film again. As for the special effects, this is the 21st century...so what? After Jurassic Park, it's all pretty much a yawn. Alas, so many movie makers feel that all that is needed are some CGI monsters/explosions/lizards with missile launchers and all other sins will be forgiven. It seems particularly appropo to the horror/sci-fi genre and explains why so many comic books and/or video games are coming to the big screen (with such poor results). Just because you can make it seem as if Mario and Luigi really are gobbling up mushrooms and beating on geese-turtles doesn't mean you should.
In a marketplace overflowing with fantastically bad movies, you have far better choices for a night of hilarity and sarcastic voice-overs than this poor excuse of a movie. Furthermore, part of the charm of the 50s-70s crap is the supremely laughable special effects.

This movie had plenty of action and special effects, but it was hard to put the story together and to take it seriously with shoddy acting and directing.

3026604,2,B000YDOOEQ,"""Dragon Wars - D War"" harks back to the old days of Godzilla and other countless monster flicks. The concept is simple. You will be watching huge creatures, in this case a huge dragon, smash buildings and crash cars somewhere in Los Angles. You will find it extremely hard to follow the film's complicated story, but never mind. The visuals are decent and the film is certainly a guilty pleasure. It is like watching a Godzilla movie directed by Edward D. Wood Jr. You just cannot hate it, can you?

Still I must say the story of ""Dragon Wars"" is terribly convoluted. Jason Behr is a reporter Ethan who recollects his meeting 15 years ago with an antique shop owner Jack (Robert Forster) who tells the young Ethan an old Korean legend about two dragons and a couple of star-crosses lovers. Understand? Me? No, but do I have to?

Anyway, Ethan believes Sarah, 19-year-old American girl (Amanda Brooks), may be the key to saving the world. They meet and fall in love with each other in a most implausible way before a big dragon and an army of other creatures led by a shape-shifting warrior chase them.

Comedian-turned-director Hyung-rae Shim is no stranger to monster movies. He previously worked as director in 1999 and his film was ""2001 Yonggary"" (also known as ""Reptilian""), a remake of the 1967 film ""Yongary,"" one of the Godzilla rip-offs of the day. As he did in ""Reptilian,"" Hyung-rae Shim spent much time and money on special effects. Some of them are very impressive even though some clearly need improvement.

It was just plain, out and out, bad.  There were rocket launcher toting slugs and acting so painful I needed an aspirin.  But, it was fun.
My friend and I were alone in the theater so we made fun of it at every turn.  From LOLDragons ('It eats me!' and 'I'm in your city, eating your reincarnated virgins!') to pop culture to inside jokes, we made fun of this movie and had a wonderful time.  (At one point we broke out into Fett's Vett by M.C. Chris.  It just seemed to fit.)
Watching the movie a second time just wasn't as funny.  But the first time was such fun, we didn't even ask for our money back.

3026622,1,B000YDOOEQ,"I can't even imagine how to put how bad this movie is into words.  I'll try.  Let me start by saying that I never saw it coming.  The trailer looked good enough.  The movie started out ok, with a little too long intro/back story with some interesting CG work that was obviously made to spoof the old Japanese monster movies (or the Power Rangers for you kiddos reading this review).  After that, things went downhill... and fast.  There was so little effort made to connect you to the present day hero/heroine that you never cared about whether they ever lived or died.  Even my kids agreed.  The CG dragons, even the little ones, were all made realistically enough.  But that in no way makes up for how awful the storyline was.  Some are saying to watch this movie for the CG dragons.  Please trust me that it is totally NOT worth it.  If you must, rent it, skip to the last battle scene, watch that and that alone, and save yourself any effort to painfully sit through this thing.

End of my review

Now, for the play by play.  You by no means have to read this as it contains some big spoilers, but here goes...

My emotions throughout this movie were:  1)Initial curiosity 2)Wait for the story 3)still waiting 4)Present day comes and... Initial fears that this is all the story we're getting 5)What the heck was that?  Was that supposed to be a fight scene outside the bar?  Oh, please don't tell me this is the indicator of the level of action sequences we're going to get 6)Camera man friend of the reporter makes a couple of deadpan remarks that make me think there may be some redeeming value to the movie coming up at some point 7)stomach drops as I realize suddenly that there will be no redeeming value to this movie 8)my face melts off from the anguish boiling up inside me 9)confusion sets in... and again... and again... and again... 10)Please let the main characters just die so this movie will end now 11)YES THEY DIED! 12)Yes, I knew they couldn't have possibly died, but I was sure hoping.  Ok, I've made it this far, I can watch this ending action sequence 12)Hey, cool battle... except why suddenly does this cave look like it is outside?  oh, wait, the dragons look the same.  Which one is which?  What is going on?  Wha...  13)It's over.  Whatever.  Let me just turn it off and grab something for the indigestion I now have.",1217894400,5,2346,4.458823529411765

*Good special effects.  Lots of great battles with lots of mass destruction.
*Some vivid imagery, especially at the end.
*Good usage of mythology.
*Lots of cool creatures and weapon designs.

The Bad Things
*Everything else! The plot is kind of odd, the characters are incredibly bad, and the writing is bad.

The Questionable Things
*Some laughable scenes; can be good or bad.

This can be seen either as a really bad blockbuster or a really good B-movie.  In any case, the story qualities are terrible, and the only good redeeming quality in this movie are the smashing special effects and battles.

The DVD has good image and sound quality, and has a couple of good making-of featurettes.",1217548800,,707,4.85
3026624,5,B000YDOOEQ,"When the folks behind DRAGON WARS decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown L.A., the movie becomes enormously watchable. Until then, there's nothing to indicate that anybody involved with this unintentionally hysterical fantasy knows what the hell they are doing. Funnier when it tries to be serious, this one's for connoisseurs of the Bad Movies We Love. (And you know who you are.)

With its competent creature effects and even an homage to THE PHANTOM MENACE, (Of all things), you'll roar with glee over writer-director Shim Hyung-rae's insanely convoluted plot about how every 500 years, a girl is born who, at the age of 20, will grow - for lack of a better term - a giant glass energy ball inside of her, which must then be cut out -- killing the girl, mind you! -- and offered as a sacrifice to either the ""good"" Imoogi or the evil Buraka, two giant serpents who will transform into dragons if they eat said magic ball. To explain all this, we have Robert Forster as the reincarnation of an ancient Korean warlord, and some truly fashion - and acting - impaired leads in Amanda Brooks and Jason Behr. The latter plays a reporter who rather hilariously leaves his black friend behind to get killed in almost every perilous situation.

In the opening minutes, a narrator explains that 500 years ago a girl was born who can turn a serpent into a dragon. The first girl, a Korean lass in the 16th century, has been reincarnated as a dull Southern Californian named Sarah (Brooks). The snake and some crypto-medieval army are after her; yet, as befits some certain pretty L.A. girls, she's clueless. Her dreams of doom get her institutionalized, but a young reporter named Ethan (Behr) - reincarnated himself, maybe from the 16th-century Korean Tom Cruise - knows what's up and tries to keep her alive.

Beachfront make-outs and mysterious clothes changes ensue.

The computer-generated birds breathe fire on people. The helicopters empty round after round on the relentless snake. The snake lunges at cars and slings them 200 feet. The cameras whoosh between skyscrapers and plummet with burning helicopters and dying birds. (The sequence with Behr and Brooks caressing on a rooftop while bullet casings rain down on them is truly special and should have director Michael Bay writhing with envy.)

Shim was obviously going for an adventure with a GODZILLA-like feel, but the camp panic and mock seriousness undermine his efforts at every turn. And some of the dialogue suggests a John Hughes version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS: ""The fate of the world rests on your shoulders,"" says wise old Robert Forster to Jason Behr. ""Deny this. And you will deny yourself everything. Even the girl.""

3026625,3,B000YDOOEQ,"The CG is excellent. It's like Lord of the Rings taking place in model L.A. The problem is, the story sucks. The main actress doesnt know how to act at all. I strongly suggest you to rent it, and fast forward only to where the helicopters fight the flying dragons. The bucks and the time saved can be spent much better elsewhere.",1216512000,,329,4.32258064516129
3026626,1,B000YDOOEQ,"This movie is just plain bad. It is not supposed to be funny -- it is a very serious attempt to bring to life a Korean legend. I actually give this movie 1.5 stars because it's not a bad time killer while getting ready for bed -- maybe watch 15 minutes here and there.

But if you think this is going to be some kind of satirical film because of the reviewer that gave it 5 stars, then you will be sorely disappointed. There are a few interesting scenes, especially at the end, but that's about it. The plot is a let down, and the movie is just too disjointed.",1216339200,,560,4.090909090909091
3026627,3,B000YDOOEQ,"Honestly, I have seen most of the actors in this movie elsewhere, and they are all WAY better than this. Their acting is uniformly flat, and that may seem funny to some, but to me it's just plain BORING. The story has potential, and even though the exposition scenes are awkward, I kept finding myself wishing the actors would PLEASE, OH PLEASE, GET PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING!!! But, then again, I didn't buy this for the acting, I bought it for the dragons.

And the dragons ROCK! Let's be clear here: No one bothered to see this movie because Jason Behr was in it except for a few lonely female fans of the old Roswell TV show. No one saw this movie expecting the next great franchise-starter like Spider-Man or Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Nope, we watch this for the DRAGONS.

The CG dragons are awesome, and it gives me a new appreciation for how Asian dragons can be conceived and executed. I have seen well-done dragons and mediocre dragons and even some horribly bad ones, but these are so entirely different and well-conceived that you've just got to rewind and watch the fights again. The snake-like dragons, the turtle-like dragons with rocket launchers, the flying and the 'raptor dragons -- but really, the masterpiece is the Celestial Dragon at the end. My son and I kept going back through that last scene over and over. The Celestial Dragon was just so graceful and deadly and majestic all at once. Just beautifully executed.

Who cares if the jump from LA to that Never-never Land where dragons duke it out is the worst transition in modern cinema? Who cares if the army of evil dragons is vanquished way too easily? We want to watch flying dragons and Blackhawk attack choppers fighting over LA! We want to watch the two big guys finally face each other! We want to see how the good serpent intends to outwit the bad serpent and gain the girl's dragon mojo! We could care less about the acting.

So, 5 stars for awesome dragons and fights, 1 star for acting and story development, which averages out to a solid 3 stars. Like dragons? Buy this film. Like good action sequences? Rent it. Looking for romance and intrigue? Find another movie to watch.",1216339200,,2170,4.5994832041343665

3026641,2,B000YDOOEQ,"When I saw the preview for this movie, I was looking forward to seeing the film.  The whole premise was interesting and, to be honest, a lot of countries other than the U. S. have been making some original and interesting movies (such as Japan and their horror movies).  This film is a dud, unfortunately.

  The story revolves around dragon folklore in ancient Korea, where two mystical dragons await the arrival of a special young woman's twentieth birthday.  At this time, the young woman, who has been born for the sole purpose of giving either the good or bad creatures the ability to become powerful celestial dragons, falls for the young man who is trained to protect her and see that she completes her destiny.  The two lovers run from their fate and die before she can bestow the special gift from heaven on either creature.

  Now, in present day, both are reincarnated, along with their old mentor, to finish the task that was their lot in life.  All this sounds pretty good but the entire movie falls so short of its promise.  The acting by all of the cast is weak, as though none of them cared anything about the story.  The editing was very sloppy and the horrible dialogue is, at times, cringe inducing!  The reason I gave two stars to this train wreck of a film is the special effects.  The dragons and other mythical creatures are incredibly well done and a pleasure to watch.  This is the one reason to see this film.  You will not be treated to a great plot or award-winning acting, by ANY means, but the CGI created monsters will be worth your while.

  Add this to your dvd library?  Only if you are a CGI fanatic who enjoys nothing more than watching cool creatures on film.  If you are looking for a good story and good acting...keep looking!",1212278400,,1765,4.5015772870662465

It is about two people who are living their next lives in Los Angeles (They were Koreans 500 years earlier). And some Korean knights are after one because she needed to be sacrificed in order to wake up the Good Imoogi (a serpent-dragon). Meanwhile, there is another serpent-dragon is wreaking havoc in Los Angeles and the citizens just want to dispose of it.

The climax is outstanding. The Korean knights capture the man and woman; they tie the man up, and they sacrifice the woman and the Imoogi is finally woken up. The two dragons fight each other. The man and the woman escape and the woman sacrifices her life to strengthen the good dragon. She tells the man to not be sad, they would eventually be together again.

The biggest problem with this film, and there are many problems with this film, is that it seems to be edited by someone using all the finesse of Freddie Kruger slashing up a screaming teenager.  Scene changes are frequently abrupt, and flip to unrelated, often confusing, acts.  The film's prologue is too long, and often snooze-worthy.  I can suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for a gi-normous snake to rampage around a city, looking for someone.  I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for virtually no one interrupting their day-to-day lives while a huge snake tears up their city.  In the world of Dragon Wars, apparently no one ever heard of the concept of ""evacuation"".  Hang out; dodge pieces of building torn loose by the big snake; grab a cappuccino; and go on with your day.  The hero was tiresome; the military and FBI were portrayed as incompetent; and the whole situation was tiresome.  I found myself rooting for the big, bad, snake to take them all out, and end the misery that is this film.  The best part was the end of the film.  One reason: the film was over!  Another reason being the final scene was actually well done, with a great CG fight scene between two CG snaky-dragons.  The actors actually provided some good acting in the final sequence, although the hero's presence was a big band-aid for one of the multitudinous plot holes.

As far as effects go, I rate it 5 Stars. The story, not so much. The characters seem very shallow. And the story as well. For example if your looking for something to stimulate your mind, well this is about a 2 inch pool of water. It's not very deep. But if your looking just to be entertained, well its  a 2 inch pool of water that spans over a mile wide.

So if your looking for a lot of great effects..and action, and dinosaur's chomping on people, and small flying dragons taking down apache helicopters and vise versa.. well this is the movie for you!

Because it has all of this.

One of the things I liked in this movie, is the fact, that the soldiers and the dinosaurs/creatures/dragons..serpents, are not invincible. It was so awesome to watch bullets take chunks out of the enemy. Now that.. was paying attention to eye candy.

From the previews, it looked, at first glance, that D-Wars got it right. You had a battle royal betweem dragons and their allies against tanks and attack choppers within the steets of a crowded city (and this sequence is why this movie get the second star from me).

Unfortunately, that is a small portion of this movie. The rest is about flashbacks and ""destiny"" and prophesy and ""mystical only way to win"" scenerios. No, the military can't defeat the dragons, only the ""good snake"", whatever it was called, can by eating the heroine's essence.

The final battle was also far too dark and hard to view. Overall, major disappointment.",1206921600,,771,5.015625
3026663,1,B000YDOOEQ,"I saw a preview for this movie when watching another DVD.  I guess they showed all of the great scenes of dragons destroying a city in the preview.  Because those 5-10 minutes of the movie were the only ones even possibly worth watching.  If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't even spend $3 on a rental.  I'd wait until it was on network TV so I could watch the destruction scenes for free and skip the rest and watch something else.

This story is so disjointed and makes no real sense.  Every 500 years with the ability to make a dragon superior.  If it's a war between the good & bad dragon for the power, why is it that only the bad dragon is out & about and fighting in the city?  The good dragon lets all the destruction happens and waits in a cave for the girl to be brought there? Get real!  This would have been better if the two dragons had armies and were fighting each other over the city.

The girl with the power is under quarantine, but a news reporter trying to help her gets let in by a doctor who likes him on TV.  Then, when the bad dragon attacks the hospital, the doctor (for unknown reasons) breaks in and says ""You have to get her out of here.  Take the stairs""  And in a crowded hospital only one car is in the parking lot?  Whatever!

The story is hard to follow & hard to get into or believe for one minute.  How a giant dragon is crawling on a building but no one sees it or knows it is beyond me (guess the city is blind until tanks roll down the streets).  All key players are reincarnated....umm okay.  And the Army is led by a guy that gets hit by a car (twice).  Oh..and the guy falls in love with ""quarantine girl"" when they stop to gather their thoughts by walking on a beach (no less than 6 hours before he met her).  Again...get real!

Some reviewers say this is supposed to be a comedy.  Albeit, there are some funny parts, I don't think this movie is a comedy in any sense of the word.  Just goes to show that good special effects can't save a move that is so horrible with a hard to follow story line, bad acting, and thoroughly painful time between destruction scenes.

3026684,1,B000YDOOEQ,"To John Hancock: No, I don't know jack about Korean culture, and I don't care.  Do you really think that anyone who picks up this DVD is saying to themselves, ""Cool, I get to enjoy some Korean culture tonight!""  This is supposed to be a monster movie.  That's how it was marketed, at least here in the US.  If you think it's such a fantastic window to the Far East, then get yourself a plane ticket and go watch it over there!

And to the reviewer who thinks that monster movies shouldn't be expected to have plots and good acting, wake up!  The 70's are over.  People are not so forgiving anymore about a ""B-rated"" movie that delivers on gore or nudity or martial arts and nothing else.  What's funny is, this movie couldn't even provide any of those.  It tried to limp along with it's half-baked plot and horrific (I mean, HORRIFIC, acting) and couldn't even give us a decent dragon battle until the very end.  By classic monster movie standards, this movie has little to offer.  Even movies like ""Anaconda"" and ""Lake Placid"" have at least something for you to take away, like a wide-eyed scream at the sight of a ridiculously huge alligator.  D Wars didn't even give us a glimpse of genuine reaction when the beasts started to emerge.

I'll go along with the guys who say this movie is sheer comedy.  I agree, it's so bad it's funny.  But don't try to make this thing out to be a culture piece.  That's something I'll bet even the D Wars writers would laugh at!",1203379200,,1464,4.406716417910448

3026686,2,B000YDOOEQ,"The narrator of DRAGON WARS: D-WAR explains in the opening scenes of the movie that the film is based upon a Korean legend.  Viewers should take that into account because even though the title says DRAGON WARS, the movie doesn't have any dragons until the end and is instead all about the Korean legend.

The movie opens when a handsome reporter for a national news organization, Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) arrives upon the scene of a massive ""incident"".  It's never really revealed what the incident is, but there's lots of destruction and many people are hurt.  While at the scene, Ethan sees an object that reminds him of a strange happening of his youth.  Flashback to fifteen years earlier when Ethan is with his father at a junk and antique story run by a guy named Jack (Robert Forster).  Ethan comes across a box that contains an item just like the one he sees at the incident site in the future.  Jack pretends to have an episode with his heart so that he can be left alone in the store with Ethan to tell him what has happened.  Apparently, Ethan is the reincarnation of an ancient warrior whose sole purpose is to make sure that a young woman, the Yuh Yi Joo, who was born with a mysterious power and the mark of the dragon.  The Yuh Yi Joo is to be united with the Imoogi (good giant snake creature) so that the Imoogi can become a dragon, protect humanity, and ascend into heaven.  In his former life 500 years before, Ethan failed at his task and now is being given another opportunity.  If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry; you don't have to really know what's going on to be able to enjoy the film.

Besides the Imoogi, there is also an evil giant serpent called the Buraki that tries to prevent the Yuh Yi Joo from uniting with the Imoogi. In addition to being a huge and evil snake, the Buraki have all kinds of different minions to assist him in his destruction including a Darth Vader-look- alike warrior and his armed swordsmen, giant Stegosaurus-looking reptiles that have cannons attached to their backs, ostrich-like reptiles, and miniature flying dragons.  All of these creatures and people have awakened and are on the loose roaming around L.A. seeking out the woman who is the Yuh Yi Joo.  Ethan realizes he has to find her and get her to the Imoogi before its too late.  As it turns out the Yuh Yi Joo is a girl named Sarah (Amanda Brooks) and has been having strange dreams.  Her body is also acting really strange.  Ethan finds Sarah, but ends up falling in love with her all over again (just like he did in his first life 500 years ago) and has to decide whether to let his love rule or save the world.

DRAGON WARS: D-WAR was written, directed, and co-produced by Hyung-rae Shim.  After watching the documentary featurette ""5,000 Years in the Making"" on the DVD, I learned that Shim is the most famous comic in Korea.  In Korea, he's like Jim Carrey, Steve Carrel, and Will Ferrell all combined.  He had wanted to direct a major movie for sometime and decided he would adapt the Korean story of the Imoogi into a modern, Western setting.  The movie took over five years to make and cost around seven million dollars to make.  It was apparently was Shim's desire that the film serve as a springboard for Korean films to get into the lucrative Western (U.S.) market.  As for as Korean films go, the movie is one of the highest grossing Korean movies of all time and it received and was released on a wide scale in the United States.

The movie does have a very complex and convoluted plot. But, that's no different than any other Asian sci-fi-action movies.  The writing is atrocious, but considering the script was written by a Korean who doesn't speak very much English, it's not as bad as it could be.  The actors do a decent job considering the material they have.  The special effects are very well done and are probably the best part of the film.  In my opinion, the action sequences are the best part of the movie.  I found it highly entertaining to watch the technologically advanced military forces fighting against giant reptiles and men wearing magically armor fighting with swords.  There's also a lot of comedy in the movie.  For instance, there is one scene when this ancient evil warrior who worships the Baraki gets ran over by a car not once, but twice within three minutes. I found myself almost rolling on the floor in laughter at that point.  I realize that even though DRAGON WARS: D-WAR was made by the biggest comic in Korea, it isn't supposed to be very funny. Nevertheless, it is.

Recommended for anyone who is looking for a complete mind-candy movie that doesn't really make much sense.  If you have an interest in popular foreign-based films, you may want to watch this movie.  You may not understand why it was so popular in Korea, but at least you can say you've seen one of the top-grossing Korean movies of all time.

The DVD includes the featurette ""5,000 Years in the Making"" which explains how the movie came to be made, some animatics, and conceptual art gallery.  I highly recommend watching ""5,000 Years in the Making"" either before or after watching the movie because it provides some great background information.",1203206400,,5195,4.570194384449244

This director had a vision to bring this story to the West.  I wish he'd spent some time talking to people who are natives here that actually understand Korean culture, because we could have told him one thing that would have made this movie avoid a whole lot of criticism and given it great appeal:  set the movie not in LA but in Seoul and use KOREAN actors.  I wish the movie had been done that way instead of using these American actors who really aren't very good actors.

The story, what little, non-sensical story there is, isn't of much concern here, as everyone involved in Dragon Wars seems to know just what they're doing here.  For the most part, Dragon Wars is actually kind of enjoyable, in a really dumb kind of way, but even the most die hard of sci-fi/horror fans may have a hard time here and feel like they're watching a Sci-Fi Channel original movie.

Spielberg didn't produce this movie.  It was made on a budget that would be laughed out of Hollow-wood.  With all that said, this movie was extremely exciting and a joy to watch as long as you don't take it, or yourselves, too seriously.  Yes, the story was contrite and had plenty of ""whatever, come on!"" moments, but the premise, was great.  The fact that they didn't cave into the ""happy ending"" pressures earned kudos in my book.  But let's be clear: it's a giant monster flick.  Dragons!  The concept of fighting dragons is FINALLY dealt with properly from a culture that truly understands the mythos of dragons.  China couldn't have done it any better.  The climatic scene (the fight) was outstanding!  For anyone to expect anymore out of the resources given to this movie, please!  You should be applauding it.

I actually went out of my way to go see this movie because the previews made it look like something I was in the mood to see, a mindless action flick with dragons. I love dragon movies, and I was really in the mood for some action, but NO! There is NO action in this god forsaken movie. I can honestly say that the $7 I spent on my ticket were the worst $7 I've ever spent ON ANYTHING!

For a movie called Dragon Wars, there's one thing that's noticeably absent throughout almost the entire movie, the dragons. The entire first 3/4ths of this movie center around some mindless plot from ancient Korea that is so needlessly complicated that I literally fell asleep while watching. Some giant snake wants to go to heaven, so it needs to eat a Korean girl with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder but she gets away and dies so he needs to wait another 500 years for her to come back alive... in LA? Huh? And the snake thing is already there waiting for her? How did it know she was there? For that matter, how could a giant snake sneak around LA, slither onto rooftops of crowded buildings, and eat an elephant from a zoo, without anyone seeing it? Hell, at one point it charges down a crowded street and then disappears without a trace. Yeah, right.

Finally, in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, I finally got to see a battle with dragons and, uh, giant rhino things on one side and the US military on the other, and I have to admit that its not that bad, but it only lasts about five minutes and then goes back to the brain dead plot. Come on, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I wanted some mindless violence and dragon battles. Is that so much to ask for?

Don't even get me started on the acting, the script, or the effects; I'd never finish this review if I tried to explain just how bad they were. Let's just say that I had to watch this movie again, I'd probably stab myself in the knee just to dull the pain.

There is an amazing number of plot holes.  The story stumbles and falls on its face on more than one occasion.  And perhaps to top it off, it's probably more hilarious in its attempts to be serious than when it goes for an intentionally humorous moment.

Unfortunately for this review, it has been a few months since I have seen this in theaters, so there are probably a few details that I will not be able to recall in order to help describe the atrocity that is 'D-War'.  Of course, kids will most undoubtedly love this movie for both the stupid fun from its action sequences, and the goofy looking monsters which I refuse to call dragons.

3026719,4,B000YDOOEQ,"When I see such things as a litany of hilarious ""things I learned from watching Dragon Wars"" and complaints that there is really only one dragon and he appears only at the very end, it does make this film seem pretty stupid - but despite all of the oddities, gaps, and other problems with the plot, I had a ball watching it.  Maybe it's just the fact that I've tried very hard to never let the kid in me fade away, but dude, there's destruction on the level of a good Japanese Godzilla movie, the CGI effects are a wonder to behold, and I don't know where else you will ever find gigantic sloths with missile launchers on their backs in the year 1507.  It also doesn't hurt that the lead actress is pretty darn hot.

Admittedly, the backstory is incredibly long, complicated, and foreign (as in Korean legend), but let me break it down for you.  Let's start with Imoogis, giant serpents who lived in the heavens long ago.  Every five hundred years, one good Imoogi is rewarded for its good deeds by receiving the Yuh Yi Joo, which allows him to become a celestial dragon.  Among these Imoogis was an evil one named Baruki, who lusted for the Yuh Yi Joo.  To keep him from getting it, the Yuh Yi Joo was hidden on Earth - but it wasn't hidden very well, as Baruki knew it would be borne inside the body of a twenty-year-old woman who was born with the image of a red dragon on her shoulder.  An old warrior and his protg are sent to safeguard the Yuh Yi Joo and make sure the girl is sacrificed to the good Imoogi once her twentieth birthday comes.  Last time, back in 1507, there was a problem, as the young warrior fell in love with the girl.  To cut a long story short, both the good Imoogi and Baruki were forced to wait another five centuries for a chance to ascend into the heavens.

In 2007, the Yuh Yi Joo resides in the body of Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks), and a TV reporter named Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) comes to realize that he is the reincarnated young warrior destined to protect her.  He has to find her first, which isn't easy given the fact that Baruki and his hordes of servants set out tearing Los Angeles apart to find her first.  Will Ethan be able to save her from Baruki?  Will he seek to change their fate once again or deliver her to the good Imoogi?

Director Shim Hyung-rae reportedly spent several years trying to make this film a reality, so all of the criticisms of the plot are more than valid.  One would think, for example, that even the most star-struck of L.A. residents and tourists would actually notice a giant serpent tearing its way through the city.  You also have to wonder why the FBI would so readily accept the ""ancient legend"" explanation of the monster - or how they figured out so quickly that the serpent was looking for Sarah Daniels.  The list goes on and on.  Having enjoyed the film so much, though, I just think all of these things are funny.  In fact, they almost make me want to watch the film again to see what other goofs I can find.  I'm sure the epic scale of the action and the incredible special effects wouldn't diminish very much on a second viewing, either.  I really don't understand how so many people can label Dragon Wars one of the worst movies ever made - they obviously haven't seen a lot of the obscure B-movies I've suffered through.",1200700800,3,3311,4.358306188925082

3026721,5,B000YDOOEQ,"Holy Crapazoid, what the heck were the negative reviewers watching, because it sure as heck wasn't this amazing giant creature movie extravaganza.

After seeing the trailer for this film, I was looking forward to a pretty good flick, but then I started to read many disparaging reviews, and had second thoughts, but lucky for me, I found a new copy for a ridiculously low price, and figured, what the heck.

One hour and twenty two minutes later, the film was over, one minute after that, I was in the car, racing back to the place I had gotten my copy, in hopes that the other copy they had, was still there, because I knew that once my friend had seen it, he'd want his own copy.

It is really that much fun.

First off, from the reviews that I had read, they made it sound like you had to wait till the end of the film to see any actual special effects, but boy, was that nowhere close to the truth, as the whole film is laced with amazing CGI creatures, interacting quite seamlessly with the real world (think Jurassic Park's T-Rex and the SUV's, but done on a grander scale, and you've got a slight idea of how cool the effects are).

Now before I go any further, let me point out that I'm of the old F/X school of thought, tending to prefer models and stop motion animation to the over use of CGI, but I have to say that the CGI creatures in this film had life to them, with amazingly subtle gestures incorporated with very life like texturing and personality that just totally made you believe that what you where watching was really happening.

Next I had read that the story was silly, with gapping plot holes or that it was just  completely incomprehensible, well, for any one with a short attention span, or who thinks that they don't have to actually watch the whole film to understand it, then yeah, but for majority of movie watchers who like to pop some corn, turn down the lights, and amerce themselves in a great flick, then the film makes sense, and is a whole lotta fun to watch.

And lastly, I read that the acting and directing was sub par, but I found the acting to be fine, in the context of what is happening in the film, and as for the directing, this director could put Michael Bay to shame, what with the insane amount of CGI interlaced with real elements (i.e. people, cars, etc.) that appear quite seamlessly through out the film.

Then, no action until the last three minutes that leads to the COOL one to one final battle of the two dragons.

I thought that Dragon Wars was about a war between dragons, not humans! the only good stufs were the special effects that were AWESOME! Some human fights and the war in the city which was well edited. The rest was lame. Not to mention the bad acting.

3026728,5,B000YDOOEQ,"I am a 56-year-old movie buff and right off let me confess, I love this movie.

In my opinion this movie was never intended to be taken seriously at all.  Consider that in the first exposition scenes you have not one, but 2 entirely different characters in different scenes say directly to the narrator in the middle of his attempted explanation of this nonsensical tale ""what are you talking about?"" I don't believe this was accidental folks, this is called comedy.

One thing to be aware of when you're watching this movie is that the director is the most popular comedian in the entire country of Korea. He gained his fame and fortune as comedic actor. In other words his entire professional career has been based on making people laugh.

I think most people who are reviewing this movie are completely missing the comedy.  Frankly I found the movie to be hilarious.

How anyone could possibly take this movie seriously after seeing the Darth Vader character stupidly get run over by a car 2 times in a row is beyond me. That was obviously comedy (and very funny).

Yes it is entirely overblown.  Layers of complete absurdity are piled with additional layers of even more absurdity. Which makes it a perfect satire of the Star Wars, Lord of the rings, Harry Potter and all of the rest of the overly pompous mega-movies.  If there is a big overblown scene in one of those movies you're going to see a similar scene in this one.

A few examples.  The Gungan Army scene from Star Wars episode 4 -- only this time the Army with the cute, smiling dinosaur critters with the weapons on their backs are the bad guys.  And these smiling dinosaurs are wreaking total havoc on Los Angeles fighting the LAPD. The incongruity of the destruction and the cute smiley dinosaurs is absolutely hilarious.

Remember the giant explosion scene in Independence Day with the flames and flying cars rushing up the street? It's here, but with a very funny twist.  In this movie the same thing is done by a giant snake rushing up the street.  The exorcism scene in the Exorcist?  Yep, it's here too, tossed in like the kitchen sink, completely unconnected to any plot points.

Giant marching Imperial Army and Ninjas?  Sure enough.  Darth Vader character with a ridiculously laughable sinister voice?  Of course. Rampaging Jurassic Park dinosaurs?  You got it.  Dogfights straight out of Independence Day?  It's here too.

Savor the site of Ray Harryhausen look-alike creatures doing massive destruction that Ray most certainly dreamed of, but couldn't accomplish with the technology of his day. I can tell you that he is smiling in his grave cause this movie delivers a wonderful tribute to his work.

Let me name a few more of the movies that have tributes here.  Pitch Black, King Kong, Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Men in Black, Dragonheart, Ghostbusters, Godzilla, Ninja Mutant Turtles, the Host, The Thing, Rodan and even Monty Python and the holy Grail. It doesn't stop there, look carefully and you'll see many many more.

Does the acting suck?  Absolutely. Is the story completely incomprehensible?  It most certainly is.  Is it even more ridiculous than Star Wars, Lord of the rings or dozens of others.  Yes it is, and I believe that was exactly the point.

I predict this movie will be watched at midnight showings at colleges 10 years from now with folks rolling in the aisles.

I have seen lots of Hollywood studio comedies recently and have not laughed nearly as hard as I did watching Dragon wars.  I literally had tears streaming from my eyes many times because I couldn't stop laughing.

So give yourself a break from any pretensions of seriousness, have a glass of wine and have a fun time watching and laughing at the funniest, most ridiculous spectacular eye candy CGI movie ever.",1200268800,93,3776,4.756923076923077

3026741,1,B000YDOOEQ,"I don't like writing bad reviews. Usually, if I don't like something, I'll simply move on. But this movie is terrible. It is, at best, a test of your own personal patience. If you can watch the entire thing without interruption, then chances are you are one of the most patient living humans on the face of this earth. D-Wars is, from start to finish, a series of melodramatic moments highlighted here and there by Power Rangers-esque special effects. If you want that kind of entertainment, then I'd check out Xena: Warrior Princess. At least that doesn't try to take itself too serious.

What D-Wars is attempting to be is an action-packed disaster movie based on Korean mythology. It follows the story of how a good snake can become a heavenly dragon, and how an evil snake will stop at nothing to steal that gift away from the good one. But this gift comes from a twenty-year-old human girl with a red-dragon tattoo. And I think that's all that I need to say. The story is contrived, forced, and put together in the most cliche way. Highlights include: a bad guy conveniently stepping into place to be hit by a car so that the protagonists can escape capture; a chanting bad guy who just sounds ridiculous; a series of happenstances in which the hero suddenly gets the answer to his problem without any real work; and finally a sad unbalance of emotional content (meaning that one moment they're invoking laughs, the next they're deadly serious, ruining whatever momentum the story may have been building).

So, if there is one thing that should be noted before you purchase, it's this: you'll be wasting your money. If you have any interest at all in good movies, then you'll hate this.

It might have been better if they got writers that weren't 10 years old! There was little or no fleshing out of the plot and it was hit or miss whether a scene would actually move the plot along or just waste space. And don't get me started on the computer graphics. What is this the mid 90's again? They were TERRIBLE! There were parts of the movie where either non-computer graphic objects were moving very oddly in comparison to the the computer generated objects on the same frames. (E.G. where the serpent crashed through a building at night and a car was driving by and swerved around it.), or the computer generated creatures seemed fuzzy in comparison to the real scenery. Also there were cars that were thrown around by the serpent, that seemed to me like the special effects guys just filmed someone throwing matchbox cars around and putting a computer generated layer on top of them to put in the movie. The acting wasn't anything special either, especially atrocious was the villain. He didn't have many lines (thank god), but the ones he had were horrible.

This film was apparently made for a single demographic only. 9-12 year olds with a fascination for dragons and other creatures of the scaly type. Because anyone past the age of 13 would roll their eyes at this steaming turd of a movie.

Honestly, I didn't think this was that bad a movie (given what others posted) - I enjoyed it - least most of it (bought & watched the DVD). I think this would a been a great movie if it wasn't for a few things. Number one problem (IMO) was the lead male character - I don't know if it was the actor (Jason Behr, I think) or just the character he was playing, but he just seemed to suck the life out of every scene he was in. I think if his character had a bit more personality, the movie would have been a lot better. The editor could have done a bit more with the pacing of the movie - it is a bit uneven in places. Felt like you were hitting speed bumps during some parts.

What I did like: The special effects were great! Reminded me of the CGI from the latest Star Wars movies (wouldn't be surprised if some of the same people worked on this movie). Could a used a bit of gore though - the creatures were a bit too ""clean"". I also liked the ending - especially the type of dragon that the Imoogi turns into - wasn't expecting that.

Japan does not have the market cornered on legendary creatures. Sure, they have Godzilla and his horde of monstrous companions Mothra and family. But, dragons, while oriental, are not specifially Japanese. That was the starting point for writer/director Hyung Rae Shim and executive producer Woo Taek Kim.
""We set out to make a film that had universal appeal"" they commented in the special features. ""And to do that, we had to make our Korean film as universally acceptable as possible. We set the film in locations from New York to Los Angeles, and recruited world class musicians (Dies Iraes) and sound effects specialists.""

The result is an outstanding film that examines the legend of Buraki and the good Imoogi. Buraki is a 200 meter dragon/snake/serpent that can only be defeated by the Imoogi and the Yuh Yi Joo, a re-incarnated 500 year old beauty. An American reporter Ethan and his 'beloved' Sarah run from the mythical monsters through crowded city scapes while a mystical battle is being fought.
With any film that deals with a 'legend', North american audiences have a tough time thinking past the obvious. Our lives are spent without a thought for the other worldly battles that rage above us, or have raged in ages past. Such is this film. The ambitious film by first time director is not a $200 m Peter Jackson production, but rather a project seething with dedication finished for a small fraction of a Jackson film.
Sure, it does have deficiencies, but what do you expect when your main characters are CGI, and the FBI/CIA are battling mythical monsters with handguns. This film is the Orient meets the Americas. Mysticism meets the mafia. Legend meets the law keepers. It is exactly what you might expect in such a 'real' confrontation.
The special features tell the story of the film, from concept to final production with commentary by comedian turned director. Unlike many monster films, this has a remarkable story behind the production. Younggu Art Studios is going to be a first class facility in the near future.
Production wise, it is very professional. First class CGI, audio tracks, and modelling. It beats any Godzilla film fins down. Look for it at your local video store or online at [...]

3026767,1,B000YDOOEQ,"This movie sucked so badly that it actually lowered the air pressure in theaters where it was shown. Really. This is not a good movie.

That said, the movie has one redeeming feature. The dogfights between the dragons and the helicopters are nicely animated and very pretty. Sadly, the dogfight scenes are all near the end of the movie, and what you have to sit through to get to them should be prohibited by the Geneva Convention as cruel and unusual punishment. Bad acting, bad pacing, bad writing, bad music.. the film starts out bad and somehow manages to get worse with every slowly passing scene.

Note to the director: In a movie called Dragon Wars, you might want to have DRAGONS on the screen! You almost never see them until the end of the movie. Substituting a mystical soap opera that occasional mentions dragons does not cut it.

I confess, when I went to see this movie, I knew that I was not in for a stellar cinematic experience simply from the title. ""Dragon Wars - D-Wars""? Huh? Why did they have to add the ""D-Wars""? The sheer redundancy boggles the mind. Thankfully that kind of title doesn't make it into most movies. Imagine ""Star Wars - S-Wars"" (shudder). Anyway, I knew I wasn't in for a good film when I bought my ticket, but a bad movie can be fun if it is made with a light touch and a sense of humor. Sadly, this movie takes itself very seriously, and the end result is a long boring wait as you sit hoping that they might somehow, somtime, eventually show you a dragon.

If you want to view this movie, here is what I recommend you do. Pop the DVD in and immediately select the dogfight scenes near the end of the movie. Watch these scenes (approx 10 minutes), marvel at the pretty dragons battling it out with the helicopters, then eject the disc when the battle ends. You have now seen the only good portion of Dragon Wars - D-Wars. At this point, dig a deep hole in your backyard and drop the DVD into it.

The movie starts off with the most wild concept you can possibly imagine, or rather, the most wild concept that a 4th grader can possibly imagine, then sets it on the big screen. One of the first scenes we get is an army attacking a village... but not just any army! Oh no. This army is full of - get this - huge dinosaurs that look vaguely like a Stegosaurus but they have - sit down for this one - rocket launchers on their backs. And if THAT wasn't enough, these Rocket-Shooting-Stegodons are being ridden by black-clad ninjas!

So these ninjas are riding towards this city on their Stegodons with rocket launchers, right, and whatever 4th grader thought this movie up is not satisfied. So in fly the Pterodactyls that breathe fire. But the Pterodactyls, while cool, are not enough. In rides - now this is the best part by far - raptors (like in Jurassic Park) but riding one of these raptors is... The Shredder! From Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! But it doesn't stop there! Then this old Korean wizard flies out of nowhere and does magical/kung-fu battle with the Shredder! All while the dinosaur-riding, rocket-shooting ninjas and their fire-breathing Pterodactyls are tearing up the town!

And that is in the first 15 minutes of the movie.

The kid at the beginning sums up the movie nicely in one of his early lines. Just as the random creepy shopkeeper (who for some reason is safe enough to leave a child with - go figure) is finishing with his wild tale of dinosaurs and grenadier wizards, the kid looks up and says, ""Uh, what are you talking about?""

I actually went out of my way to go see this movie because the previews made it look like something I was in the mood to see, a mindless action flick with dragons. I love dragon movies, and I was really in the mood for some action, but NO! There is NO action in this god forsaken movie. I can honestly say that the $7 I spent on my ticket were the worst $7 I've ever spent ON ANYTHING!

For a movie called Dragon Wars, there's one thing that's noticeably absent throughout almost the entire movie, the dragons. The entire first 3/4ths of this movie center around some mindless plot from ancient Korea that is so needlessly complicated that I literally fell asleep while watching. Some giant snake wants to go to heaven, so it needs to eat a Korean girl with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder but she gets away and dies so he needs to wait another 500 years for her to come back alive... in LA? Huh? And the snake thing is already there waiting for her? How did it know she was there? For that matter, how could a giant snake sneak around LA, slither onto rooftops of crowded buildings, and eat an elephant from a zoo, without anyone seeing it? Hell, at one point it charges down a crowded street and then disappears without a trace. Yeah, right.

Finally, in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, I finally got to see a battle with dragons and, uh, giant rhino things on one side and the US military on the other, and I have to admit that its not that bad, but it only lasts about five minutes and then goes back to the brain dead plot. Come on, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I wanted some mindless violence and dragon battles. Is that so much to ask for?

The Battle scenes are breathtaking. It is very realistic and I couldn't believe these CGs were created by a director with such little experience.

Good qualities in realistic sounds and exciting music.

The story line was pretty unique and interesting.

I dunno whether director shim didn't have enough money to recruit excellent actors, but I have to be honest. Shim might have a good sense in story-directing/CG graphics, but he certainly lacks a quality of choosing good actors. Especially those 2 main characters!!! their acting was just sooo bad.... I am sorry, but they ruined the whole good qualities in this movie.

Shim, seriously, next time if you want to make a better SF movies, do a better job in casting, and making scripts.

3026788,2,B000YDOOEQ,"When it comes to giant monster B movies--like Godzilla for example--Japan is the first name that comes to mind but look out; Korea could be the new kid on the block. They rank in at number 10 in the overall movie market in the world--according to the Korean Film council. The Host (17.2 million dollars [budget at 11 million]) and now the ""smash hit"" D-Wars (54 million [budget between 30 and 70 million]) are the latest from the Far East. However, the movie The Host swept Korea's Blue Dragon Awards in 2006 and was considered one of the best Foreign films of 2006, but unfortunately D-Wars will probably be viewed as one of the worst movies for 2007, especially for us here in America. The poor direction by unknown Shim Hyung-rae, the confusing story, the emotionless/wooden acting and the sloppy editing are the sad focal points. All those factors destroy any possibility for the graphics to entertain (the battle sequence in LA and the final dragon fight at end of the movie). The CGI was created by Shim's Younggu-Art Movie Company. Godzilla from Toho studios, where are you? We need you back now.

A CGNN television news reporter by the name of Ethan (Jason Behr) is covering his latest story in an open field in Los Angeles: where major destruction has occurred. Within moments, he notices that the police are dusting off a huge green substance; he knows that it is the scale of the legendary Korean Beast known as Imugi; a mythical dragon creature. In a short while, he returns to the news studios but has a flash back of when he was a young boy and his encounter that he had with a mystical storekeeper named Jack (Robert Forster [Ancient Warlord/Sensei]).

He learns that he is the reincarnated spirit of an ancient Korean warrior-apprentice named Haram--learning the martial arts skills by the Warlord/Sensei--who has to defend Princess ""Tattoo"" Narin from all her enemies. He falls in love with her. However, his Sensei could care less because the Princess--who is now 20 years old--needs to give up her special life force to the Imugi, by scarification. They--either the good, or bad Imugi--will ascend to Dragon hood through ingestion.

Within a short while, a crisis develops in this Kingdom. The evil General as well as his Power Rangers/Storm Troopers, and most importantly the evil giant serpent arrive first and a great battle ensues. There is no escape for the couple, therefore they decide to jump off a cliff. Through their failure, their reincarnated spirits will repeat this event again in 500 years to battle the bad imugi, the evil general and his evil army.

It is present day again and now Ethan must find a girl named Sara Daniels (Amanda Brooks) with a tattoo marking of the good Imug (she is the Princess). However, this will be difficult because there are many girls at this age that fit this description. He uses the help of a co-worker to search through the computer database to help narrow his search but he eventually is able to locate her at a hospital. What will be the out come of Ethan and Sarah? Will they defeat these forces of evil?

Confused about the story? Trust us, don't even sweat it.

When seeing the preview for D-Wars I had a flashback of Destroy All Monsters, as other movies such as King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and All Monsters Attack (1969) that the Toho Company Ltd. released. As a kid these monsters were everything, even though they were just a bunch a people in rubber suits, there was artistry.

In D-Wars you can definitely see the theme of such American Science Fiction movies as The Terminator series (1984-2003) with dialog similarities between the main characters, and even the similar cinematography from King Kong (1976) and the American Godzilla (1998). Is the director paying homage to these movies or to Korean Nationalism because at the end of the film we see Shim use Korean print and Shim quotes ""D-War and I will succeed in the world market without fail?"" Keep dreaming.

We will tell you from our point of view that you cannot impress us or the world market. Especially from the American actor Robert Forster who gives us a mono log in the flash back in which he sounds like an ESL instructor, teaching a class of foreigners. The romantic chemistry that never develops from our lovers--Ethan and Sara--because they seem hopelessly confused if they even want to know each other. Should they not be able to recognize their reincarnated spirits? Where is Ethan's ability of the marital arts or even superhuman strength, he is a reincarnated warrior? He just keeps running away. Then there is the evil General along with the Atrox soilders who give us the impression of evil Power Rangers/Storm troopers from Star Wars. The General spoke and sounded like Mr. Bean. That's being funny unintentionally.

For the new generation of Asians filmmakers, people wearing rubber suit and city miniatures are something from the past. For Better or for worse, they upgraded themselves to the new computer graphics extravaganza of today. Honestly we liked the classic monster films from that period. But not everything is lost in D-Wars, one of the best moments in the film is the dragon invasion of the city where we get to see some decent monster action against the military--the creatures look pretty decent at times and really terrible at others--but the action itself is quite interesting. Let's not forget the final battle between the two dragons. The loud dragons face off and goes on for a while, but it has very little realism, but quite intense nevertheless.

Proceed with caution because if you're a fan of the B Japanese monster movies, you will be disappointed with the cheesiness of this ""upgraded"" Asian monster film. Where is the fun of the classic monsters from the past? Just because you have computer graphics, it doesn't mean that you're going to make a great film. despite some decent battle moments; the film is flat because of the hilarious acting, confusing plot and video-game special effects.

3260964,1,B000YDOOEQ,"This was terrible. When I saw the previews all I thought about was the animation, and how good it
 was. The animation was good, I'll say that much about it. The rest was horrid. I saw the film with my mom, three minutes into it we turned to each other and she asked if I wanted to go. I wanted to see if it got better, it didn't.

For one the plot had been done billions of times before, and was totally dull. It was like a sad combination of Star Wars and Jurassic park. One of the enimies (Of which there were too many) talked in a pathetically low voice and was unbeatable except when he was hit by a car. The ""bad"" snake, which sadly wasn't even a dragon got within and inch of getting the good guys, then stopped dead, screamed for a minute or so letting its prey get away before chasing after. The ""good"" snake doesn't show up until the very end, so we barely even see it.

There was one part to this movie that was decent, when the guy with the low voice walks through a wall, and a little old lady tries to follow after and bumps into it. At the end when a dragon finally appears it is awsome-looking, but hangs around way too long, so you're just wondering when the dumb movie will be over.

Please do not waste your time or money on this, unless you like wasting time or money.",1194048000,,1287,4.095238095238095
3260965,1,B000YDOOEQ,"Here's a piece of advice: if you have a movie called ""Dragon Wars,"" it's probably not a good idea to save the dragon footage for the last five minutes. The rest of the film does showcase a number of other creatures, such as winged dinosaur-hybrids and things that vaguely resemble rhinos. We even get to see gigantic snakes that have the potential to become dragons. But where are the actual dragons? Why keep us waiting until the end? This is but one example of how hopelessly incompetent this film is; ""Dragon Wars""--or ""D-War,"" or whatever it's called--is an attempt but not an actual end result, an absolute mess filled with unconvincing special effects, horrendous performances, and a plot I neither understood nor cared about.

The film opens with a Los Angeles news reporter named Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) trying to get the latest scoop on an explosion. Not much is known about what happened; all anyone can determine is that a gigantic, odd-looking animal scale is found under the soil. From what animal, no one knows. But whatever it comes from, seeing it triggers a number of flashback sequences, the first of which takes place fifteen years ago, when Ethan was only a boy. He and his father enter a local antique shop and meet Jack (Robert Forester), the elusive owner. He notices a strange sight; as Ethan approaches a wooden chest, it opens and reveals a brilliant white light. This signals to Jack that Ethan a destined young boy.

With me so far? Because it only gets worse from here. After sending the father away (by faking a heart attack and begging for help), Jack tells Ethan of an ancient myth that dates back to sixteenth-century Korea. Apparently, titanic serpents called Inoogi are destined to become dragons. For its good deeds, an Inoogi is rewarded--it joins with the soul of a Yuh Yi Joo, after which it ascends to heaven. A Yuh Yi Joo, by the way, is a special girl born once every 500 years--she's recognizable because she has a red dragon tattooed on her left shoulder. Anyway, evil serpents called Buraki have always tried to stop Inoogi from ascending, and they use their minions to find the Yuh Yi Joo and destroy her. Such was the destiny of a young Korean girl back in the 1500s; she fell in love with the guard sworn to protect her, meaning she failed to meet with her destiny. Both the Inoogi and the Buraki remain roaming the earth, waiting for the next Yuh Yi Joo to be born.

I apologize for rambling, but I'm trying to make sense of this story. There's no reason why a ninety-minute film has to have this much crammed into it, especially since none of it is of any interest. If they wanted an escapist film, then they should have made an escapist film; forget the complex details and just give us something entertaining. You'd think that such a convoluted back-story would add a little something, but no, it doesn't. If there's a point to this film, then I have no idea what it is.

But back to the plot. As a boy, Ethan was told that the next Yuh Yi Joo will be a girl named Sarah, and at age twenty, she'll be old enough to converge with the Inoogi. He was also told that he must find and protect her, no matter what. He's then given a special talisman (what makes it special is anyone's guess). Now as an adult, Ethan uses his reporter's skills to track Sarah down; by ""reporter's skills,"" I mean he has his monotone assistant, Bruce (Craig Robinson), do the work for him. This is when we finally meet Sarah (Amanda Brooks), a pretty young girl who was born with a red dragon tattooed on her left shoulder. After seeing news footage of Ethan at the explosion site, she begins to feel funny, as if she knows something terrible is going to happen. Of course, no one believes her, and she soon finds herself locked in a psychiatric ward.

The Buraki, meanwhile, is loose and hot on her trail. I don't bother questioning how it manages to find her, but I do wonder how an 800-foot long snake can go unnoticed until it attacks. How can something so large slither around buildings, over rooftops, and through streets without making even the tiniest noise? Never mind--the point is that it's after Sarah, and Ethan has to protect her from it. Through a series of laughably preposterous circumstances, they find each other and escape from the hospital. After battling the Buraki atop the Federal Building in Downtown Los Angeles, they witness the climactic fight between the Buraki and the Inoogi.

The FBI gets involved about halfway through the film, and at that point, my interest had completely faded. For reasons never adequately explained, they know everything about the dragons and Sarah. They also think that killing Sarah is the only solution to the problem. I wanted to tell these people that another problem exists, one that's even bigger than feuding dragons. The movie itself is the problem; ""Dragon Wars"" is mind-numbingly bad, the kind of bad that wouldn't even give rise to a cult classic. I wasn't expecting great cinematic art, but at the very least, the filmmakers could have tried to make a fun movie. After all, I just wanted to see some dragons.

3260969,4,B000YDOOEQ,"A bit of a western centric casting with a script style that is pure Asian.  The comic relief is subtle but it is there.  The SFX as as integral to the movie as any Kaiju tale should be.
This is a movie that takes a classic Asian (Korean I think) folk tale and gives it a current times reincarnation.  Such Asian folklore tales are not often understood at all by U.S. audiences that have never been exposed to culture from anywhere but the Hollywood media machine.  The doing a modern take on an old folk tale is a difficult proposition at best.  If you do a period piece; mode film makers have no clue about older cultures and put in so many anachronisms it crosses the line to total eff-up the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy fiction..  (Crowd at joust singing ""We will, we will, rock you"" was the kind of joke that ruined the flow of the story so bad that the whole crowd watching the movie on DVD went to fix popcorn at the same time.)
  I give this one 4 out of 5 for entertainment value.  For what it is; well done.  Very enjoyable.  The mix of styles and tropes was just a bit jarring in the edit so I couldn't go for 5 of 5 for excellence in folk tale modernization.  (The historic exposition at the beginning with the Hong Kong mythic action movie feel clashed with the Kaiju invasion feel of the bulk of the movie.  There are more movie tropes in Asian cinema than ""Kung Fu Action Movie"" and Godzilla)
  I actually bought this movie on Blu-Ray based on a passing mention of liking the movie by a Youtube movie reviewer,  Comic Book Girl 19 (her youtube channel name) pegged it.  Fun Asian cinema and well worth watching.",1471132800,,1640,4.324590163934427

The special effects were outstanding, the story line ok and the cast was good.  What was excellent was the action, especially the war zone in downtown Los Angelesl.  Now I live in NY
(Staten Island) so I didn't mind seeing LA getting  mushed up with tanks, gigantic dirty snakes and lots of mini dragons!!  And I don't remember
seeing so many cars getting mangled!  Yes, there was a dark Vader like evil  wizard-like person and lots of Asian Cylon like solders running amok
through Hollyweird and lots of gooey looking monsters with some kind of cannon devices attached to their backs.  And yes, the acting was just
so so, but the movie was very entertaining, violent yet without unnecessary gore that is in some movies (& TV).  But it had an interesting story
combining Asian mythology and conventional nasty dragons.  The big dragon at the end was an Asian conception, with four legs, fire breather,
but with the worm like body of the East ideas.  And the girl sacrificed herself to save the human race.  Some parts were funny, but the visuals
were just outstanding; this could not be a cheap, cheesy, low budget film; must of had a substantial budget.  I would not call this a children's film;
too violent and too hard for them to follow the story.  And the first part of the film was a little sluggish, but it got much better later.  The music
was fine, especially at the end.  The producers probably spent more money on port-a-potties than Ed Wood spent on all his cheesy dramas!

3261036,4,B000YDOOEQ,"The director, Korea's most popular comedian, decided to realize his dream of making a high-tech sci-fi/fantasy film with a budget Hollywood would scoff at. His sincerity and years of intense effort paid off. He took a Korean legend, added to it, and went to several big shot American effects people, soundtrack writers, sound man, and the City of Los Angeles, asking them to help him make this film. He wanted it to be the best and most expensive sci-fi/fantasy film Korea had ever made, and the clips he showed in the U.S. convinced the people he needed to help him for a fee WAY below their usual. He built his own studio, invited experts and amateurs alike to help him put this together, and he realized his dream. The animatronic creatures (more than just dragons here!), CGI and miniature buildings are really well done. No, it doesn't look like a Godzilla film! The American actors (most of the cast, and it was made in English) are not all that scintillating, and the details of the storyline are a little shaky here and there. But all-in-all, I enjoyed the film and recommend it. The first part is a bit slow, but once the dragons and other creatures are released, it's great fun. How the director ever talked the city of L.A. to allow him to film tanks in the street after 9/11 is a mystery to me and, judging from the bonus feature, to the director, but he did it! I particularly like the giant snake-like dragon climbing up and around a skyscraper.

3261040,4,B000YDOOEQ,"I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this movie a comedy.  Yes, there are strained attempts at humor that fall flat, but that in itself is not enough to suppose the whole wreck can be excused away as a well-meaning chuckle.  I think the filmmakers fully intended to make an action/fantasy film that was meant to be taken seriously.  The results though, are quite another matter.  This movie is literally all over the place, complete with a false start, a trek back in time, reincarnation, and prehistoric creatures galore.  Precious little of this makes any sense.  It doesn't help that confusion appears to be part of the filmmaker's strategy.  Scenes are purposely kept brief, barely taking the time to establish what is going on before jumping across town or skipping merrily from one day to the next in the blink of an eye.  There are even several faux scenes that turn out to be mere dreams.  Good grief, the main character goes from a boy with blue eyes to an adult with brown eyes in a close-up no less!  A lot of this movie is just weird.  One minute it's like something out of Star Wars, then it borrows from Godzilla, it even has a berserk killer fed (Chris Mulkey)!  I think gratuitous best explains the direction this film takes.  It's outrageous, nonsensical, and oddly short at only 90 minutes.  And yet, for all its shortcomings, or because of them, I actually liked this movie.  I'm still trying to figure out how or why I do, I just do.  (Maybe because it suffers from the ugly puppy syndrome.  Someone has to like the poor thing, it's ugly............but it's a puppy.)",1357516800,,1590,4.561837455830389

The longer I watched, the more I kept thinking, ""It's got to get better."" But my final thought was, ""Why? Why did I bother?""

The computer generated creatures in this dog were amazing, rivaling those of much bigger star power and box office success. And, the cast included some decent actors but, alas, even they could not rescue the sophomoric script. More to the point, I wonder what the actors or their agents were thinking when they accepted a role in this thing. I'm reminded of something I read recently that said there wasn't any role Liam Neeson would turn down. (I don't necessarily agree with that statement, but it illustrates my point.)

Perhaps some reviewers here on Amazon are referring to something else when they say this was a good movie.

About three quarters of the way through I realized that I had seen it before a long time back but had mostly forgotten about it; the ending finally jarred my memory and helped me confirm this was the second time I'd seen it. It brings in a lot of Eastern mysticism including reincarnation so you have to go with the flow on a number of levels to enjoy the movie.

If you're willing to accept the basic assumptions of the movie it provides an evening's entertainment that isn't too shabby. The CGI is good and the sound is adequate so it's best to just sit back and let the story flow around you; if it makes you laugh that's good too.",1318204800,,902,4.427710843373494

And of course what better way to do it then with monster movies.  Romance, drama and political thrillers are hard to produce for audiences of different cultures.  But monster movies are easy.  Starting with ""The Host"" several years back, S. Korea follows up with Dragon Wars.  Based loosely on Korean legend, as the movie tells it, the storyline is transplanted to modern-day Los Angeles.  The movie features great special effects, great battle scenes between supernatural soldiers and the US Army, and the bad dialog, mediocre acting and illogical scenes common to many monster movies.  For example, the bad dragon has an incredible ability to race down streets faster than a speeding car.  Yet in scene after scene, the hero and heroine just manage to escape on foot.  How nice!

That's Dragon Wars. It's a fun ride with loads of special effects, but no actual storyline that makes sense, nor any professional actors, but who cares - it's enjoyably watchable, and I've seen a lot worse acting coming out of Hollywood and a worse plots too.",1297555200,,561,4.3428571428571425

The story is a loosely strung together tale of fate that links a man and a woman in a struggle to defeat evil in the form of a 200-meter-long snake. To defeat it they must follow in the footsteps of their ancestors (a kind of 'history repeats itself' motif) and perform the right actions this time or else the evil...snake...(boy does that sound lame) will continue to wreak havoc in future generations to come. What better way than to summon a GOOD 200-meter-long snake that will defeat the evil one. Hardly a thrilling story line.

On top of this is the horrendously poor acting. A side character plays a better role than the two main ones. The script is poorly delivered and made to sound hokey and lame. What should be terrifying is laughable. Failure has truly reached its summit with this film and if I had the option to give this movie no stars I would.

Though, I will say that the snakes were definitely cool looking. I have a feeling they spent their entire budget on CG animation leaving very little for the rest of the movie's necessities.

Acting (by the humans) is, honestly, down to 1-2 stars (at most) and the story is quite (un)believable. But that's cool. We're here to see L.A. go to dust! Seeing D-War in widescreen is nice but switch to full screen for some real experience. While you might miss the ""big picture,"" you are thrown into the action head-first. No need for 3D.

The story is about a young boy that has the power to reveal the contents of an ancient box and gains the trust of an old wizard who tells him a story of another time. As the story unfolds a reporter is trying to find out about some odd ocurrences taking place in Los Angeles. Although it jumps between the current and ancient it actually is interesting if you sit back and just soak it in without being judgemental. If Shim claimed it did not have any comedy in it I would disagree, but if he said it was not a comedy I understand, because it isn't a comedy.

From a tranquil Korean village lost in the centuries of time to a modern metropolis, the Story of Buraki and the Good Imoogi unfold.  This is the story of two ancient Korean serpents who sought the Yeouiju, a mystical orb from heaven which would transform one of the serpents into a dragon.

You have the love story of Ethan and Sarah which began in that Korean village when they first faced their destiny as young lovers, Haram and Narin.  Unfortunately, their decision to defy their destinies ended in tragedy and allowed Buraki time to create an invincible army.

The war between good and evil waged as Ethan and Sarah fought to survive.  Finally, the epic, climactic battle between Buraki and the Good Imoogi came down to Ethan's bravery and Sarah's ultimate sacrifice.

In the end as Ethan watches the Celestial Dragon ascend to the heavens, he says good bye to Narin, his true love and Bochun, his old master and friend.  Now, he faces his destiny alone for the first time.

I can't even begin to start on the stuff thats just so friggin' funny in this movie, but you know you're watching something special when a black hawk helicopter pilot has a dragon latch on to his helicopter, so he pulls out a revolver (not a modern day pistol of any kind, a REVOLVER) and starts shooting at it through his window.

In short, this movie has absolutely no redeeming cinematic value, and that's exactly why I can't recommend it enough, its that awesomely bad.

For those who like that sort of thing (and you know who you are) you will not be let down, Dragon Wars is truly a rare, special gem in the hilariously bad movie universe.",1246233600,2,1307,4.385892116182573

3261097,4,B000YDOOEQ,"Lightning-fast editing and a continuous streak of monsters keep the fun and escapism ongoing and on target in this unfairly slammed movie.

Bad reviews had kept me from purchasing Dragon Wars before, too bad because this is a fun one that delivers the action without taking itself too seriously (if you want a serious, brooding monster/hero flick get the 2003 Hulk directed masterfully by Ang Lee).

Just a splash of occasional romance completes an interesting movie that would be a good companion to Cloverfield. CGI effects are effective and actually much better than some more highly reviewed recent films. The battle of downtown LA was particularly well executed.

Dragon Wars appeals to both adults and youngsters, give it a try.",1237161600,,734,5.1
3261098,5,B000YDOOEQ,"I think that most reviewers seem to be missing the point that a new form of cinematic art has been coming into existence in the last forty years. It can best described as the Heroic Fantasy Epic.  Of course, it has been around in literature for a long time, but only in the last forty years have movie makers begun developing the tools to produce the effects needed to bring these stories to life.  It requires believable creatures that cannot possibly be represented by human actors or animals in costume and makeup.  It requires a beleivable representation of magic on a huge scale.  And, it requires an audience that is willing to accept that the ""real"" physical world we see around us is not the only possible world, and that it is possible for an intelligent, imaginative person to create  a fictional world where some of the laws of science as we know it do not necessarily apply.
This is such a movie.  It is complete fantasy and, as such, many of the rules of logic that govern other genres do not apply.  It is not necessary that the character of the Hero be fully developed.  It is sufficient that his intentions are Good and that he is brave and reasonably likeable.  Of course, it is much better if he is a fully rounded character and that his feelings be well expressed, but he is really a symbol for the forces of Goodness and, therefore need not be too carefully drawn.  Likewise, The villain is only a symbol for the forces of Evil, so he can be even less well defined.  In the same vein, the Deus Ex Machina is a perfectly acceptable device to bring about the destruction of the forces of Evil, since it is a major belief in almost every major religion that a human being alone is not capable resisting true Evil and that faith in, or the grace of, some deity is absolutely needed to overcome that Evil.
In essence the plot of an Epic fantasy is basically a form of melodrama.  First, the Hero is introduced, along with the Heroine and the rest of the Good people.  Then the Villain enters, usually disguised (thinly) as a good person. The Villain then gathers his henchmen secretly while gaining the confidence of the good people and tricking them into doing things that will later put them completely in his power.  The Hero usually suspects the Villain but he is not believed until it is too late and the Villain has sprung his trap.  When the trap is sprung, the good people try to resist, but to no avail, the villain has them trapped and helpless.  Meanwhile, the Hero perseveres and eventually finds the Villains weakness.  He confronts the villain and foils his plan, but the villain has foreseen this and responds with brute force. The good people dispair, but the Deus Ex Machina intervenes and the Villain is driven off. the good people celebrate.  Not every Fantasy follows this plot exactly, but in almost every case the Villain menaces, The Hero resists, and Goodness wins in the end, no matter how dark the outcome appears to be at the end of the next-to-last scene.
This movie is a fantasy epic.  If you follow the directors comments in the special features, you will know that it was built around some of the best special effects and CIG work I have ever seen. Once once he had that, the director took them and his script to Hollywood and recruited actors, sound designers, and a composer. The characters are not well developed because the movie is so packed with action that there is no time to waste on expressing the feelings or opinions of the cast.  There is no time to show the developing love story of the hero and heroine, so the narrator simply tells you that they fell in love and they then react to the events as a person in love would.
I loved this movie.  Yes, it has some flaws, but they are overshadowed by the hard work and effort that the makers put out to bring it forth. If you examine all the great classic movies of all time, they all had their flaws.  But what made them great was that they grabbed your attention and kept you watching in spite of it. This movie does just that. You are swept from one action to the next without a pause for breathe.  You don't miss the love scenes because you know that If the charactors had stopped moving long to make love, they would have been killed or eaten.  In the final analysis, this is a well-crafted action adventure filled with exceptinally good special effects and backed with an excellent musical score.  The sound effects are just as good as the outstanding visual effects.  Ignore the critics, sit back and enjoy the story and you'll have a good time.",1233878400,4,4557,4.493333333333333
3261099,1,B000YDOOEQ,"A few months ago, my teen kids and I stumbled across this and were intrigued by the straight-from-a-young boy's-imagination description on the back of the dvd box, especially this jewel: ""giant lizards with missile launchers."" Still, not having that much disposable income, I decided against it. Months later, Christmas morning, my kids gave it to me as something of a joke gift. That night, the four of us gathered together, fully anticipating a glorious B-movie cheesefest. We were all so sadly disappointed. It isn't that the armed lizards weren't in it, but it was just so insipid, so poorly written and acted, and so entirely reliant on CGI effects that we found nothing to convince us not to take it back for a trade-in. You know a movie is bad when it fails to live up (or down) to even the most jaded movie fan's low standards. This movie had the overall feel of a bad tv show, or more accurately, a long, unending toy commercial (figures sold separately). I'd rather sit through episodes of The Land of the Lost until I went insane than watch this terrible film again. As for the special effects, this is the 21st century...so what? After Jurassic Park, it's all pretty much a yawn. Alas, so many movie makers feel that all that is needed are some CGI monsters/explosions/lizards with missile launchers and all other sins will be forgiven. It seems particularly appropo to the horror/sci-fi genre and explains why so many comic books and/or video games are coming to the big screen (with such poor results). Just because you can make it seem as if Mario and Luigi really are gobbling up mushrooms and beating on geese-turtles doesn't mean you should.
In a marketplace overflowing with fantastically bad movies, you have far better choices for a night of hilarity and sarcastic voice-overs than this poor excuse of a movie. Furthermore, part of the charm of the 50s-70s crap is the supremely laughable special effects. To paraphrase reknowned sage and gag-inducing soccer mom Sarah Palin, you can put make-up on a pig, but it's still just a pig. Oink oink.",1230336000,,2064,4.800561797752809

However, I quickly found myself fast-forwarding through the movie to avoid having to just shut down the movie completely.  I am a fan of good story-telling and acting, but I'm drawn to action and to special effects.  This movie had plenty of action and special effects, but it was hard to put the story together and to take it seriously with shoddy acting and directing.  The plot is intriguing, but could have done without the steretypical Chinese connections to dragons and instead been about a new idea in monster movie-making.  I would recommend this movie for it's great battle sequences, but you will find yourself uninterested in the back story and somewhat confused when it's all said and done....and happy too that it was over.",1228953600,,891,4.7973856209150325
3261101,2,B000YDOOEQ,"""Dragon Wars - D War"" harks back to the old days of Godzilla and other countless monster flicks. The concept is simple. You will be watching huge creatures, in this case a huge dragon, smash buildings and crash cars somewhere in Los Angles. You will find it extremely hard to follow the film's complicated story, but never mind. The visuals are decent and the film is certainly a guilty pleasure. It is like watching a Godzilla movie directed by Edward D. Wood Jr. You just cannot hate it, can you?

Still I must say the story of ""Dragon Wars"" is terribly convoluted. Jason Behr is a reporter Ethan who recollects his meeting 15 years ago with an antique shop owner Jack (Robert Forster) who tells the young Ethan an old Korean legend about two dragons and a couple of star-crosses lovers. Understand? Me? No, but do I have to?

Anyway, Ethan believes Sarah, 19-year-old American girl (Amanda Brooks), may be the key to saving the world. They meet and fall in love with each other in a most implausible way before a big dragon and an army of other creatures led by a shape-shifting warrior chase them.

Comedian-turned-director Hyung-rae Shim is no stranger to monster movies. He previously worked as director in 1999 and his film was ""2001 Yonggary"" (also known as ""Reptilian""), a remake of the 1967 film ""Yongary,"" one of the Godzilla rip-offs of the day. As he did in ""Reptilian,"" Hyung-rae Shim spent much time and money on special effects. Some of them are very impressive even though some clearly need improvement.

If you are looking for better acting, better story and three-dimensional characters, you can choose ""Gwoemul"" or ""The Host"" directed by Joon-ho Bong. ""Dragon Wars - D War"" is a typical case of ""so bad so good"" and should be seen and enjoyed as such.",1228003200,2,1771,4.703225806451613

The movie started out ok, with a little too long intro/back story with some interesting CG work that was obviously made to spoof the old Japanese monster movies (or the Power Rangers for you kiddos reading this review).  After that, things went downhill... and fast.  There was so little effort made to connect you to the present day hero/heroine that you never cared about whether they ever lived or died.  Even my kids agreed.  The CG dragons, even the little ones, were all made realistically enough.  But that in no way makes up for how awful the storyline was.  Some are saying to watch this movie for the CG dragons.  Please trust me that it is totally NOT worth it.  If you must, rent it, skip to the last battle scene, watch that and that alone, and save yourself any effort to painfully sit through this thing.

Ok, I've made it this far, I can watch this ending action sequence 12)Hey, cool battle... except why suddenly does this cave look like it is outside?  oh, wait, the dragons look the same.

*Good special effects.  Lots of great battles with lots of mass destruction.
*Some vivid imagery, especially at the end.
*Good usage of mythology.
*Lots of cool creatures and weapon designs.

The Bad Things
*Everything else! The plot is kind of odd, the characters are incredibly bad, and the writing is bad.

The Questionable Things
*Some laughable scenes; can be good or bad.

This can be seen either as a really bad blockbuster or a really good B-movie.  In any case, the story qualities are terrible, and the only good redeeming quality in this movie are the smashing special effects and battles.

3261121,5,B000YDOOEQ,"When the folks behind DRAGON WARS decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown L.A., the movie becomes enormously watchable. Until then, there's nothing to indicate that anybody involved with this unintentionally hysterical fantasy knows what the hell they are doing. Funnier when it tries to be serious, this one's for connoisseurs of the Bad Movies We Love. (And you know who you are.)

With its competent creature effects and even an homage to THE PHANTOM MENACE, (Of all things), you'll roar with glee over writer-director Shim Hyung-rae's insanely convoluted plot about how every 500 years, a girl is born who, at the age of 20, will grow - for lack of a better term - a giant glass energy ball inside of her, which must then be cut out -- killing the girl, mind you! -- and offered as a sacrifice to either the ""good"" Imoogi or the evil Buraka, two giant serpents who will transform into dragons if they eat said magic ball. To explain all this, we have Robert Forster as the reincarnation of an ancient Korean warlord, and some truly fashion - and acting - impaired leads in Amanda Brooks and Jason Behr. The latter plays a reporter who rather hilariously leaves his black friend behind to get killed in almost every perilous situation.

In the opening minutes, a narrator explains that 500 years ago a girl was born who can turn a serpent into a dragon. The first girl, a Korean lass in the 16th century, has been reincarnated as a dull Southern Californian named Sarah (Brooks). The snake and some crypto-medieval army are after her; yet, as befits some certain pretty L.A. girls, she's clueless. Her dreams of doom get her institutionalized, but a young reporter named Ethan (Behr) - reincarnated himself, maybe from the 16th-century Korean Tom Cruise - knows what's up and tries to keep her alive.

Beachfront make-outs and mysterious clothes changes ensue.

The computer-generated birds breathe fire on people. The helicopters empty round after round on the relentless snake. The snake lunges at cars and slings them 200 feet. The cameras whoosh between skyscrapers and plummet with burning helicopters and dying birds. (The sequence with Behr and Brooks caressing on a rooftop while bullet casings rain down on them is truly special and should have director Michael Bay writhing with envy.)

Shim was obviously going for an adventure with a GODZILLA-like feel, but the camp panic and mock seriousness undermine his efforts at every turn. And some of the dialogue suggests a John Hughes version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS: ""The fate of the world rests on your shoulders,"" says wise old Robert Forster to Jason Behr. ""Deny this. And you will deny yourself everything. Even the girl.""

But if you think this is going to be some kind of satirical film because of the reviewer that gave it 5 stars, then you will be sorely disappointed. There are a few interesting scenes, especially at the end, but that's about it. The plot is a let down, and the movie is just too disjointed.",1216339200,,560,4.090909090909091

Their acting is uniformly flat, and that may seem funny to some, but to me it's just plain BORING. The story has potential, and even though the exposition scenes are awkward, I kept finding myself wishing the actors would PLEASE, OH PLEASE, GET PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING!!! But, then again, I didn't buy this for the acting, I bought it for the dragons.

And the dragons ROCK! Let's be clear here: No one bothered to see this movie because Jason Behr was in it except for a few lonely female fans of the old Roswell TV show. No one saw this movie expecting the next great franchise-starter like Spider-Man or Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Nope, we watch this for the DRAGONS.

The CG dragons are awesome, and it gives me a new appreciation for how Asian dragons can be conceived and executed. I have seen well-done dragons and mediocre dragons and even some horribly bad ones, but these are so entirely different and well-conceived that you've just got to rewind and watch the fights again. The snake-like dragons, the turtle-like dragons with rocket launchers, the flying and the 'raptor dragons -- but really, the masterpiece is the Celestial Dragon at the end. My son and I kept going back through that last scene over and over. The Celestial Dragon was just so graceful and deadly and majestic all at once. Just beautifully executed.

Who cares if the jump from LA to that Never-never Land where dragons duke it out is the worst transition in modern cinema? Who cares if the army of evil dragons is vanquished way too easily? We want to watch flying dragons and Blackhawk attack choppers fighting over LA! We want to watch the two big guys finally face each other! We want to see how the good serpent intends to outwit the bad serpent and gain the girl's dragon mojo! We could care less about the acting.

S. have been making some original and interesting movies (such as Japan and their horror movies).  This film is a dud, unfortunately.

  The story revolves around dragon folklore in ancient Korea, where two mystical dragons await the arrival of a special young woman's twentieth birthday.  At this time, the young woman, who has been born for the sole purpose of giving either the good or bad creatures the ability to become powerful celestial dragons, falls for the young man who is trained to protect her and see that she completes her destiny.  The two lovers run from their fate and die before she can bestow the special gift from heaven on either creature.

  Now, in present day, both are reincarnated, along with their old mentor, to finish the task that was their lot in life.  All this sounds pretty good but the entire movie falls so short of its promise.  The acting by all of the cast is weak, as though none of them cared anything about the story.  The editing was very sloppy and the horrible dialogue is, at times, cringe inducing!  The reason I gave two stars to this train wreck of a film is the special effects.  The dragons and other mythical creatures are incredibly well done and a pleasure to watch.  This is the one reason to see this film.  You will not be treated to a great plot or award-winning acting, by ANY means, but the CGI created monsters will be worth your while.

Scene changes are frequently abrupt, and flip to unrelated, often confusing, acts.  The film's prologue is too long, and often snooze-worthy.  I can suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for a gi-normous snake to rampage around a city, looking for someone.  I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for virtually no one interrupting their day-to-day lives while a huge snake tears up their city.  In the world of Dragon Wars, apparently no one ever heard of the concept of ""evacuation"".  Hang out; dodge pieces of building torn loose by the big snake; grab a cappuccino; and go on with your day.  The hero was tiresome; the military and FBI were portrayed as incompetent; and the whole situation was tiresome.  I found myself rooting for the big, bad, snake to take them all out, and end the misery that is this film.  The best part was the end of the film.  One reason: the film was over!  Another reason being the final scene was actually well done, with a great CG fight scene between two CG snaky-dragons.  The actors actually provided some good acting in the final sequence, although the hero's presence was a big band-aid for one of the multitudinous plot holes.

3261144,1,B000YDOOEQ,I can only compare watching this movie to watching a train wreck you want to look away but can't; you have to stay to the end just to see how bad it can get.  The computer generated special effects were impressive...but just because you can do special effects with a computer doesn't mean you should...and you don't need to jam them all into one movie. If I could rate this movie lower than I hate it..I would.  The only redeeming part of this movie was the poor guy from the zoo who saw the dragon eat the elephants. The plot seemed to be the hero had to protect the young woman from the bad dragon so she could be eaten by the good dragon.  And where did that army come from? Who was the blonde shape shifter guy? Just thinking about it is making my head hurt. (And no I have never actually seen a train wreck),1209945600,2,812,4.159235668789809
3261145,3,B000YDOOEQ,"After reading this guys review - E. Osworth ""Author and Consultant"" - it made me think a little more before I started my own review.

As far as effects go, I rate it 5 Stars. The story, not so much. The characters seem very shallow. And the story as well. For example if your looking for something to stimulate your mind, well this is about a 2 inch pool of water. It's not very deep. But if your looking just to be entertained, well its  a 2 inch pool of water that spans over a mile wide.

So if your looking for a lot of great effects..and action, and dinosaur's chomping on people, and small flying dragons taking down apache helicopters and vise versa.. well this is the movie for you!

Because it has all of this.

One of the things I liked in this movie, is the fact, that the soldiers and the dinosaurs/creatures/dragons..serpents, are not invincible. It was so awesome to watch bullets take chunks out of the enemy. Now that.. was paying attention to eye candy.

From the previews, it looked, at first glance, that D-Wars got it right. You had a battle royal betweem dragons and their allies against tanks and attack choppers within the steets of a crowded city (and this sequence is why this movie get the second star from me).

Unfortunately, that is a small portion of this movie. The rest is about flashbacks and ""destiny"" and prophesy and ""mystical only way to win"" scenerios. No, the military can't defeat the dragons, only the ""good snake"", whatever it was called, can by eating the heroine's essence.

The final battle was also far too dark and hard to view. Overall, major disappointment.",1206921600,,771,5.015625
3261160,1,B000YDOOEQ,"I saw a preview for this movie when watching another DVD.  I guess they showed all of the great scenes of dragons destroying a city in the preview.  Because those 5-10 minutes of the movie were the only ones even possibly worth watching.  If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't even spend $3 on a rental.  I'd wait until it was on network TV so I could watch the destruction scenes for free and skip the rest and watch something else.

This story is so disjointed and makes no real sense.  Every 500 years with the ability to make a dragon superior.  If it's a war between the good & bad dragon for the power, why is it that only the bad dragon is out & about and fighting in the city?  The good dragon lets all the destruction happens and waits in a cave for the girl to be brought there? Get real!  This would have been better if the two dragons had armies and were fighting each other over the city.

The girl with the power is under quarantine, but a news reporter trying to help her gets let in by a doctor who likes him on TV.  Then, when the bad dragon attacks the hospital, the doctor (for unknown reasons) breaks in and says ""You have to get her out of here.  Take the stairs""  And in a crowded hospital only one car is in the parking lot?  Whatever!

The story is hard to follow & hard to get into or believe for one minute.  How a giant dragon is crawling on a building but no one sees it or knows it is beyond me (guess the city is blind until tanks roll down the streets).  All key players are reincarnated....umm okay.  And the Army is led by a guy that gets hit by a car (twice).  Oh..and the guy falls in love with ""quarantine girl"" when they stop to gather their thoughts by walking on a beach (no less than 6 hours before he met her).  Again...get real!

Some reviewers say this is supposed to be a comedy.  Albeit, there are some funny parts, I don't think this movie is a comedy in any sense of the word.  Just goes to show that good special effects can't save a move that is so horrible with a hard to follow story line, bad acting, and thoroughly painful time between destruction scenes.  I am kicking myself for wasting the $$$ to buy it!

I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option but the 1 star is for the good CGI of destruction.  Don't waste your money.  Period!",1206748800,,2295,4.098876404494382

Do you really think that anyone who picks up this DVD is saying to themselves, ""Cool, I get to enjoy some Korean culture tonight!""  This is supposed to be a monster movie.  That's how it was marketed, at least here in the US.  If you think it's such a fantastic window to the Far East, then get yourself a plane ticket and go watch it over there!

And to the reviewer who thinks that monster movies shouldn't be expected to have plots and good acting, wake up!  The 70's are over.  People are not so forgiving anymore about a ""B-rated"" movie that delivers on gore or nudity or martial arts and nothing else.  What's funny is, this movie couldn't even provide any of those.  It tried to limp along with it's half-baked plot and horrific (I mean, HORRIFIC, acting) and couldn't even give us a decent dragon battle until the very end.  By classic monster movie standards, this movie has little to offer.  Even movies like ""Anaconda"" and ""Lake Placid"" have at least something for you to take away, like a wide-eyed scream at the sight of a ridiculously huge alligator.  D Wars didn't even give us a glimpse of genuine reaction when the beasts started to emerge.

I'll go along with the guys who say this movie is sheer comedy.  I agree, it's so bad it's funny.  But don't try to make this thing out to be a culture piece.  That's something I'll bet even the D Wars writers would laugh at!",1203379200,,1464,4.406716417910448

3261183,2,B000YDOOEQ,"The narrator of DRAGON WARS: D-WAR explains in the opening scenes of the movie that the film is based upon a Korean legend.  Viewers should take that into account because even though the title says DRAGON WARS, the movie doesn't have any dragons until the end and is instead all about the Korean legend.

The movie opens when a handsome reporter for a national news organization, Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) arrives upon the scene of a massive ""incident"".  It's never really revealed what the incident is, but there's lots of destruction and many people are hurt.  While at the scene, Ethan sees an object that reminds him of a strange happening of his youth.  Flashback to fifteen years earlier when Ethan is with his father at a junk and antique story run by a guy named Jack (Robert Forster).  Ethan comes across a box that contains an item just like the one he sees at the incident site in the future.  Jack pretends to have an episode with his heart so that he can be left alone in the store with Ethan to tell him what has happened.  Apparently, Ethan is the reincarnation of an ancient warrior whose sole purpose is to make sure that a young woman, the Yuh Yi Joo, who was born with a mysterious power and the mark of the dragon.  The Yuh Yi Joo is to be united with the Imoogi (good giant snake creature) so that the Imoogi can become a dragon, protect humanity, and ascend into heaven.  In his former life 500 years before, Ethan failed at his task and now is being given another opportunity.  If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry; you don't have to really know what's going on to be able to enjoy the film.

Besides the Imoogi, there is also an evil giant serpent called the Buraki that tries to prevent the Yuh Yi Joo from uniting with the Imoogi. In addition to being a huge and evil snake, the Buraki have all kinds of different minions to assist him in his destruction including a Darth Vader-look- alike warrior and his armed swordsmen, giant Stegosaurus-looking reptiles that have cannons attached to their backs, ostrich-like reptiles, and miniature flying dragons.  All of these creatures and people have awakened and are on the loose roaming around L.A. seeking out the woman who is the Yuh Yi Joo.  Ethan realizes he has to find her and get her to the Imoogi before its too late.  As it turns out the Yuh Yi Joo is a girl named Sarah (Amanda Brooks) and has been having strange dreams.  Her body is also acting really strange.  Ethan finds Sarah, but ends up falling in love with her all over again (just like he did in his first life 500 years ago) and has to decide whether to let his love rule or save the world.

DRAGON WARS: D-WAR was written, directed, and co-produced by Hyung-rae Shim.  After watching the documentary featurette ""5,000 Years in the Making"" on the DVD, I learned that Shim is the most famous comic in Korea.  In Korea, he's like Jim Carrey, Steve Carrel, and Will Ferrell all combined.  He had wanted to direct a major movie for sometime and decided he would adapt the Korean story of the Imoogi into a modern, Western setting.  The movie took over five years to make and cost around seven million dollars to make.  It was apparently was Shim's desire that the film serve as a springboard for Korean films to get into the lucrative Western (U.S.) market.  As for as Korean films go, the movie is one of the highest grossing Korean movies of all time and it received and was released on a wide scale in the United States.

The movie does have a very complex and convoluted plot. But, that's no different than any other Asian sci-fi-action movies.  The writing is atrocious, but considering the script was written by a Korean who doesn't speak very much English, it's not as bad as it could be.  The actors do a decent job considering the material they have.  The special effects are very well done and are probably the best part of the film.  In my opinion, the action sequences are the best part of the movie.  I found it highly entertaining to watch the technologically advanced military forces fighting against giant reptiles and men wearing magically armor fighting with swords.  There's also a lot of comedy in the movie.  For instance, there is one scene when this ancient evil warrior who worships the Baraki gets ran over by a car not once, but twice within three minutes. I found myself almost rolling on the floor in laughter at that point.  I realize that even though DRAGON WARS: D-WAR was made by the biggest comic in Korea, it isn't supposed to be very funny. Nevertheless, it is.

Recommended for anyone who is looking for a complete mind-candy movie that doesn't really make much sense.  If you have an interest in popular foreign-based films, you may want to watch this movie.  You may not understand why it was so popular in Korea, but at least you can say you've seen one of the top-grossing Korean movies of all time.

The DVD includes the featurette ""5,000 Years in the Making"" which explains how the movie came to be made, some animatics, and conceptual art gallery.  I highly recommend watching ""5,000 Years in the Making"" either before or after watching the movie because it provides some great background information.",1203206400,,5195,4.570194384449244

Spielberg didn't produce this movie.  It was made on a budget that would be laughed out of Hollow-wood.  With all that said, this movie was extremely exciting and a joy to watch as long as you don't take it, or yourselves, too seriously.  Yes, the story was contrite and had plenty of ""whatever, come on!"" moments, but the premise, was great.  The fact that they didn't cave into the ""happy ending"" pressures earned kudos in my book.  But let's be clear: it's a giant monster flick.  Dragons!  The concept of fighting dragons is FINALLY dealt with properly from a culture that truly understands the mythos of dragons.  China couldn't have done it any better.  The climatic scene (the fight) was outstanding!  For anyone to expect anymore out of the resources given to this movie, please!  You should be applauding it.

I actually went out of my way to go see this movie because the previews made it look like something I was in the mood to see, a mindless action flick with dragons. I love dragon movies, and I was really in the mood for some action, but NO! There is NO action in this god forsaken movie. I can honestly say that the $7 I spent on my ticket were the worst $7 I've ever spent ON ANYTHING!

For a movie called Dragon Wars, there's one thing that's noticeably absent throughout almost the entire movie, the dragons. The entire first 3/4ths of this movie center around some mindless plot from ancient Korea that is so needlessly complicated that I literally fell asleep while watching. Some giant snake wants to go to heaven, so it needs to eat a Korean girl with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder but she gets away and dies so he needs to wait another 500 years for her to come back alive... in LA? Huh? And the snake thing is already there waiting for her? How did it know she was there? For that matter, how could a giant snake sneak around LA, slither onto rooftops of crowded buildings, and eat an elephant from a zoo, without anyone seeing it? Hell, at one point it charges down a crowded street and then disappears without a trace. Yeah, right.

Finally, in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, I finally got to see a battle with dragons and, uh, giant rhino things on one side and the US military on the other, and I have to admit that its not that bad, but it only lasts about five minutes and then goes back to the brain dead plot. Come on, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I wanted some mindless violence and dragon battles. Is that so much to ask for?

Don't even get me started on the acting, the script, or the effects; I'd never finish this review if I tried to explain just how bad they were. Let's just say that I had to watch this movie again, I'd probably stab myself in the knee just to dull the pain. Apparently this is a blockbuster in Korea; I sure hope I never have to find out what's considered a bad movie over there.

This really isn't an excuse to hate on the film, though there is plenty of reason for it.  My purpose here is to warn you away from expecting anything good should you plan to watch this movie.  There is an amazing number of plot holes.  The story stumbles and falls on its face on more than one occasion.  And perhaps to top it off, it's probably more hilarious in its attempts to be serious than when it goes for an intentionally humorous moment.

Unfortunately for this review, it has been a few months since I have seen this in theaters, so there are probably a few details that I will not be able to recall in order to help describe the atrocity that is 'D-War'.  Of course, kids will most undoubtedly love this movie for both the stupid fun from its action sequences, and the goofy looking monsters which I refuse to call dragons.

So unless you're a parent who derives pleasure from seeing their children happy, don't subject yourself to this pompous crap.

3261216,4,B000YDOOEQ,"When I see such things as a litany of hilarious ""things I learned from watching Dragon Wars"" and complaints that there is really only one dragon and he appears only at the very end, it does make this film seem pretty stupid - but despite all of the oddities, gaps, and other problems with the plot, I had a ball watching it.  Maybe it's just the fact that I've tried very hard to never let the kid in me fade away, but dude, there's destruction on the level of a good Japanese Godzilla movie, the CGI effects are a wonder to behold, and I don't know where else you will ever find gigantic sloths with missile launchers on their backs in the year 1507.  It also doesn't hurt that the lead actress is pretty darn hot.

Admittedly, the backstory is incredibly long, complicated, and foreign (as in Korean legend), but let me break it down for you.  Let's start with Imoogis, giant serpents who lived in the heavens long ago.  Every five hundred years, one good Imoogi is rewarded for its good deeds by receiving the Yuh Yi Joo, which allows him to become a celestial dragon.  Among these Imoogis was an evil one named Baruki, who lusted for the Yuh Yi Joo.  To keep him from getting it, the Yuh Yi Joo was hidden on Earth - but it wasn't hidden very well, as Baruki knew it would be borne inside the body of a twenty-year-old woman who was born with the image of a red dragon on her shoulder.  An old warrior and his protg are sent to safeguard the Yuh Yi Joo and make sure the girl is sacrificed to the good Imoogi once her twentieth birthday comes.  Last time, back in 1507, there was a problem, as the young warrior fell in love with the girl.  To cut a long story short, both the good Imoogi and Baruki were forced to wait another five centuries for a chance to ascend into the heavens.

In 2007, the Yuh Yi Joo resides in the body of Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks), and a TV reporter named Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) comes to realize that he is the reincarnated young warrior destined to protect her.  He has to find her first, which isn't easy given the fact that Baruki and his hordes of servants set out tearing Los Angeles apart to find her first.  Will Ethan be able to save her from Baruki?  Will he seek to change their fate once again or deliver her to the good Imoogi?

Director Shim Hyung-rae reportedly spent several years trying to make this film a reality, so all of the criticisms of the plot are more than valid.  One would think, for example, that even the most star-struck of L.A. residents and tourists would actually notice a giant serpent tearing its way through the city.  You also have to wonder why the FBI would so readily accept the ""ancient legend"" explanation of the monster - or how they figured out so quickly that the serpent was looking for Sarah Daniels.  The list goes on and on.  Having enjoyed the film so much, though, I just think all of these things are funny.  In fact, they almost make me want to watch the film again to see what other goofs I can find.  I'm sure the epic scale of the action and the incredible special effects wouldn't diminish very much on a second viewing, either.  I really don't understand how so many people can label Dragon Wars one of the worst movies ever made - they obviously haven't seen a lot of the obscure B-movies I've suffered through.",1200700800,3,3311,4.358306188925082

3261218,5,B000YDOOEQ,"Holy Crapazoid, what the heck were the negative reviewers watching, because it sure as heck wasn't this amazing giant creature movie extravaganza.

After seeing the trailer for this film, I was looking forward to a pretty good flick, but then I started to read many disparaging reviews, and had second thoughts, but lucky for me, I found a new copy for a ridiculously low price, and figured, what the heck.

One hour and twenty two minutes later, the film was over, one minute after that, I was in the car, racing back to the place I had gotten my copy, in hopes that the other copy they had, was still there, because I knew that once my friend had seen it, he'd want his own copy.

It is really that much fun.

First off, from the reviews that I had read, they made it sound like you had to wait till the end of the film to see any actual special effects, but boy, was that nowhere close to the truth, as the whole film is laced with amazing CGI creatures, interacting quite seamlessly with the real world (think Jurassic Park's T-Rex and the SUV's, but done on a grander scale, and you've got a slight idea of how cool the effects are).

Now before I go any further, let me point out that I'm of the old F/X school of thought, tending to prefer models and stop motion animation to the over use of CGI, but I have to say that the CGI creatures in this film had life to them, with amazingly subtle gestures incorporated with very life like texturing and personality that just totally made you believe that what you where watching was really happening.

Next I had read that the story was silly, with gapping plot holes or that it was just  completely incomprehensible, well, for any one with a short attention span, or who thinks that they don't have to actually watch the whole film to understand it, then yeah, but for majority of movie watchers who like to pop some corn, turn down the lights, and amerce themselves in a great flick, then the film makes sense, and is a whole lotta fun to watch.

And lastly, I read that the acting and directing was sub par, but I found the acting to be fine, in the context of what is happening in the film, and as for the directing, this director could put Michael Bay to shame, what with the insane amount of CGI interlaced with real elements (i.e. people, cars, etc.) that appear quite seamlessly through out the film.

3261225,5,B000YDOOEQ,"I am a 56-year-old movie buff and right off let me confess, I love this movie.

In my opinion this movie was never intended to be taken seriously at all.  Consider that in the first exposition scenes you have not one, but 2 entirely different characters in different scenes say directly to the narrator in the middle of his attempted explanation of this nonsensical tale ""what are you talking about?"" I don't believe this was accidental folks, this is called comedy.

One thing to be aware of when you're watching this movie is that the director is the most popular comedian in the entire country of Korea. He gained his fame and fortune as comedic actor. In other words his entire professional career has been based on making people laugh.

I think most people who are reviewing this movie are completely missing the comedy.  Frankly I found the movie to be hilarious.

How anyone could possibly take this movie seriously after seeing the Darth Vader character stupidly get run over by a car 2 times in a row is beyond me. That was obviously comedy (and very funny).

Yes it is entirely overblown.  Layers of complete absurdity are piled with additional layers of even more absurdity. Which makes it a perfect satire of the Star Wars, Lord of the rings, Harry Potter and all of the rest of the overly pompous mega-movies.  If there is a big overblown scene in one of those movies you're going to see a similar scene in this one.

A few examples.  The Gungan Army scene from Star Wars episode 4 -- only this time the Army with the cute, smiling dinosaur critters with the weapons on their backs are the bad guys.  And these smiling dinosaurs are wreaking total havoc on Los Angeles fighting the LAPD. The incongruity of the destruction and the cute smiley dinosaurs is absolutely hilarious.

Remember the giant explosion scene in Independence Day with the flames and flying cars rushing up the street? It's here, but with a very funny twist.  In this movie the same thing is done by a giant snake rushing up the street.  The exorcism scene in the Exorcist?  Yep, it's here too, tossed in like the kitchen sink, completely unconnected to any plot points.

Giant marching Imperial Army and Ninjas?  Sure enough.  Darth Vader character with a ridiculously laughable sinister voice?  Of course. Rampaging Jurassic Park dinosaurs?  You got it.  Dogfights straight out of Independence Day?  It's here too.

Savor the site of Ray Harryhausen look-alike creatures doing massive destruction that Ray most certainly dreamed of, but couldn't accomplish with the technology of his day. I can tell you that he is smiling in his grave cause this movie delivers a wonderful tribute to his work.

Let me name a few more of the movies that have tributes here.  Pitch Black, King Kong, Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Men in Black, Dragonheart, Ghostbusters, Godzilla, Ninja Mutant Turtles, the Host, The Thing, Rodan and even Monty Python and the holy Grail. It doesn't stop there, look carefully and you'll see many many more.

Does the acting suck?  Absolutely. Is the story completely incomprehensible?  It most certainly is.  Is it even more ridiculous than Star Wars, Lord of the rings or dozens of others.  Yes it is, and I believe that was exactly the point.

I predict this movie will be watched at midnight showings at colleges 10 years from now with folks rolling in the aisles.

I have seen lots of Hollywood studio comedies recently and have not laughed nearly as hard as I did watching Dragon wars.  I literally had tears streaming from my eyes many times because I couldn't stop laughing.

So give yourself a break from any pretensions of seriousness, have a glass of wine and have a fun time watching and laughing at the funniest, most ridiculous spectacular eye candy CGI movie ever.",1200268800,93,3776,4.756923076923077

3261238,1,B000YDOOEQ,"I don't like writing bad reviews. Usually, if I don't like something, I'll simply move on. But this movie is terrible. It is, at best, a test of your own personal patience. If you can watch the entire thing without interruption, then chances are you are one of the most patient living humans on the face of this earth. D-Wars is, from start to finish, a series of melodramatic moments highlighted here and there by Power Rangers-esque special effects. If you want that kind of entertainment, then I'd check out Xena: Warrior Princess. At least that doesn't try to take itself too serious.

What D-Wars is attempting to be is an action-packed disaster movie based on Korean mythology. It follows the story of how a good snake can become a heavenly dragon, and how an evil snake will stop at nothing to steal that gift away from the good one. But this gift comes from a twenty-year-old human girl with a red-dragon tattoo. And I think that's all that I need to say. The story is contrived, forced, and put together in the most cliche way. Highlights include: a bad guy conveniently stepping into place to be hit by a car so that the protagonists can escape capture; a chanting bad guy who just sounds ridiculous; a series of happenstances in which the hero suddenly gets the answer to his problem without any real work; and finally a sad unbalance of emotional content (meaning that one moment they're invoking laughs, the next they're deadly serious, ruining whatever momentum the story may have been building).

So, if there is one thing that should be noted before you purchase, it's this: you'll be wasting your money. If you have any interest at all in good movies, then you'll hate this.

It might have been better if they got writers that weren't 10 years old! There was little or no fleshing out of the plot and it was hit or miss whether a scene would actually move the plot along or just waste space. And don't get me started on the computer graphics. What is this the mid 90's again? They were TERRIBLE! There were parts of the movie where either non-computer graphic objects were moving very oddly in comparison to the the computer generated objects on the same frames. (E.G. where the serpent crashed through a building at night and a car was driving by and swerved around it.), or the computer generated creatures seemed fuzzy in comparison to the real scenery. Also there were cars that were thrown around by the serpent, that seemed to me like the special effects guys just filmed someone throwing matchbox cars around and putting a computer generated layer on top of them to put in the movie. The acting wasn't anything special either, especially atrocious was the villain. He didn't have many lines (thank god), but the ones he had were horrible.

Honestly, I didn't think this was that bad a movie (given what others posted) - I enjoyed it - least most of it (bought & watched the DVD). I think this would a been a great movie if it wasn't for a few things. Number one problem (IMO) was the lead male character - I don't know if it was the actor (Jason Behr, I think) or just the character he was playing, but he just seemed to suck the life out of every scene he was in. I think if his character had a bit more personality, the movie would have been a lot better. The editor could have done a bit more with the pacing of the movie - it is a bit uneven in places. Felt like you were hitting speed bumps during some parts.

What I did like: The special effects were great! Reminded me of the CGI from the latest Star Wars movies (wouldn't be surprised if some of the same people worked on this movie). Could a used a bit of gore though - the creatures were a bit too ""clean"". I also liked the ending - especially the type of dragon that the Imoogi turns into - wasn't expecting that.

The actors I think tried to make do with what they had, but even their acting came out duller then a bad joke done by Michael Richards. As much as I hate saying it and writing it these actors may need to go back to acting school.  I know its all about money in this world but really what were these producers thinking as they said, ""We are going to release this in the U.S. and its going to be huge?""  Yeah a huge waste of time, at least I didn't spend money actually watching this.  A huge relief on that part.",1199664000,2,875,4.087719298245614

Japan does not have the market cornered on legendary creatures. Sure, they have Godzilla and his horde of monstrous companions Mothra and family. But, dragons, while oriental, are not specifially Japanese. That was the starting point for writer/director Hyung Rae Shim and executive producer Woo Taek Kim.
""We set out to make a film that had universal appeal"" they commented in the special features. ""And to do that, we had to make our Korean film as universally acceptable as possible. We set the film in locations from New York to Los Angeles, and recruited world class musicians (Dies Iraes) and sound effects specialists.""

The result is an outstanding film that examines the legend of Buraki and the good Imoogi. Buraki is a 200 meter dragon/snake/serpent that can only be defeated by the Imoogi and the Yuh Yi Joo, a re-incarnated 500 year old beauty. An American reporter Ethan and his 'beloved' Sarah run from the mythical monsters through crowded city scapes while a mystical battle is being fought.
With any film that deals with a 'legend', North american audiences have a tough time thinking past the obvious. Our lives are spent without a thought for the other worldly battles that rage above us, or have raged in ages past. Such is this film. The ambitious film by first time director is not a $200 m Peter Jackson production, but rather a project seething with dedication finished for a small fraction of a Jackson film.
Sure, it does have deficiencies, but what do you expect when your main characters are CGI, and the FBI/CIA are battling mythical monsters with handguns. This film is the Orient meets the Americas. Mysticism meets the mafia. Legend meets the law keepers. It is exactly what you might expect in such a 'real' confrontation.
The special features tell the story of the film, from concept to final production with commentary by comedian turned director. Unlike many monster films, this has a remarkable story behind the production. Younggu Art Studios is going to be a first class facility in the near future.
Production wise, it is very professional. First class CGI, audio tracks, and modelling. It beats any Godzilla film fins down. Look for it at your local video store or online at [...]

3261264,1,B000YDOOEQ,"This movie sucked so badly that it actually lowered the air pressure in theaters where it was shown. Really. This is not a good movie.

That said, the movie has one redeeming feature. The dogfights between the dragons and the helicopters are nicely animated and very pretty. Sadly, the dogfight scenes are all near the end of the movie, and what you have to sit through to get to them should be prohibited by the Geneva Convention as cruel and unusual punishment. Bad acting, bad pacing, bad writing, bad music.. the film starts out bad and somehow manages to get worse with every slowly passing scene.

Note to the director: In a movie called Dragon Wars, you might want to have DRAGONS on the screen! You almost never see them until the end of the movie. Substituting a mystical soap opera that occasional mentions dragons does not cut it.

I confess, when I went to see this movie, I knew that I was not in for a stellar cinematic experience simply from the title. ""Dragon Wars - D-Wars""? Huh? Why did they have to add the ""D-Wars""? The sheer redundancy boggles the mind. Thankfully that kind of title doesn't make it into most movies. Imagine ""Star Wars - S-Wars"" (shudder). Anyway, I knew I wasn't in for a good film when I bought my ticket, but a bad movie can be fun if it is made with a light touch and a sense of humor. Sadly, this movie takes itself very seriously, and the end result is a long boring wait as you sit hoping that they might somehow, somtime, eventually show you a dragon.

If you want to view this movie, here is what I recommend you do. Pop the DVD in and immediately select the dogfight scenes near the end of the movie. Watch these scenes (approx 10 minutes), marvel at the pretty dragons battling it out with the helicopters, then eject the disc when the battle ends. You have now seen the only good portion of Dragon Wars - D-Wars. At this point, dig a deep hole in your backyard and drop the DVD into it. This will prevent anyone from ever accidentally watching this dog of a movie. Future generations will thank you.",1199232000,5,2050,4.429708222811671

The previews looked fabulous, but the movie reeked of incredibly bad dialogue, embarrassing acting and an incredulous plot.  Scenes jump around unpredictably, making the whole thing not only boring, but confusing.  Unexplained characters and strange religious/mythological twists also frustrate any intellectual stimulation or emotional involvement in the story.

The special effects were only average when compared with the film's peers, and they ease the experience only about as much as salt can improve bad food.  They just don't make a movie worth watching.

Good first big budget film from S.Korea but still a bit to go. Better than many other dragon flicks I've seen. The only problem is that the ""real"" dragon doesn't appear till the very end of the movie (last 5 minutes). And what's up with the Korean national folk music  at the end of the movie?",1198713600,5,428,4.417721518987341
3261277,2,B000YDOOEQ,"This movie is so terrible... and I mean SO terrible, that you absolutely must see it. But if you see it, you must see it with a large group of people. The movie is so bad in so many ways that it will be hard to describe them, but I can try.

The movie starts off with the most wild concept you can possibly imagine, or rather, the most wild concept that a 4th grader can possibly imagine, then sets it on the big screen. One of the first scenes we get is an army attacking a village... but not just any army! Oh no. This army is full of - get this - huge dinosaurs that look vaguely like a Stegosaurus but they have - sit down for this one - rocket launchers on their backs. And if THAT wasn't enough, these Rocket-Shooting-Stegodons are being ridden by black-clad ninjas!

So these ninjas are riding towards this city on their Stegodons with rocket launchers, right, and whatever 4th grader thought this movie up is not satisfied. So in fly the Pterodactyls that breathe fire. But the Pterodactyls, while cool, are not enough. In rides - now this is the best part by far - raptors (like in Jurassic Park) but riding one of these raptors is... The Shredder! From Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! But it doesn't stop there! Then this old Korean wizard flies out of nowhere and does magical/kung-fu battle with the Shredder! All while the dinosaur-riding, rocket-shooting ninjas and their fire-breathing Pterodactyls are tearing up the town!

And that is in the first 15 minutes of the movie.

The kid at the beginning sums up the movie nicely in one of his early lines. Just as the random creepy shopkeeper (who for some reason is safe enough to leave a child with - go figure) is finishing with his wild tale of dinosaurs and grenadier wizards, the kid looks up and says, ""Uh, what are you talking about?""

That one line sums up the whole movie. ""What are you talking about"" is something that will linger in your thoughts while you watch this amazingly, epicly wretched movie.",1198195200,25,1973,4.484679665738161

I actually went out of my way to go see this movie because the previews made it look like something I was in the mood to see, a mindless action flick with dragons. I love dragon movies, and I was really in the mood for some action, but NO! There is NO action in this god forsaken movie. I can honestly say that the $7 I spent on my ticket were the worst $7 I've ever spent ON ANYTHING!

For a movie called Dragon Wars, there's one thing that's noticeably absent throughout almost the entire movie, the dragons. The entire first 3/4ths of this movie center around some mindless plot from ancient Korea that is so needlessly complicated that I literally fell asleep while watching. Some giant snake wants to go to heaven, so it needs to eat a Korean girl with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder but she gets away and dies so he needs to wait another 500 years for her to come back alive... in LA? Huh? And the snake thing is already there waiting for her? How did it know she was there? For that matter, how could a giant snake sneak around LA, slither onto rooftops of crowded buildings, and eat an elephant from a zoo, without anyone seeing it? Hell, at one point it charges down a crowded street and then disappears without a trace. Yeah, right.

Finally, in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, I finally got to see a battle with dragons and, uh, giant rhino things on one side and the US military on the other, and I have to admit that its not that bad, but it only lasts about five minutes and then goes back to the brain dead plot. Come on, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I wanted some mindless violence and dragon battles. Is that so much to ask for?

Don't even get me started on the acting, the script, or the effects; I'd never finish this review if I tried to explain just how bad they were. Let's just say that I had to watch this movie again, I'd probably stab myself in the knee just to dull the pain.

3261285,2,B000YDOOEQ,"When it comes to giant monster B movies--like Godzilla for example--Japan is the first name that comes to mind but look out; Korea could be the new kid on the block. They rank in at number 10 in the overall movie market in the world--according to the Korean Film council. The Host (17.2 million dollars [budget at 11 million]) and now the ""smash hit"" D-Wars (54 million [budget between 30 and 70 million]) are the latest from the Far East. However, the movie The Host swept Korea's Blue Dragon Awards in 2006 and was considered one of the best Foreign films of 2006, but unfortunately D-Wars will probably be viewed as one of the worst movies for 2007, especially for us here in America. The poor direction by unknown Shim Hyung-rae, the confusing story, the emotionless/wooden acting and the sloppy editing are the sad focal points. All those factors destroy any possibility for the graphics to entertain (the battle sequence in LA and the final dragon fight at end of the movie). The CGI was created by Shim's Younggu-Art Movie Company. Godzilla from Toho studios, where are you? We need you back now.

A CGNN television news reporter by the name of Ethan (Jason Behr) is covering his latest story in an open field in Los Angeles: where major destruction has occurred. Within moments, he notices that the police are dusting off a huge green substance; he knows that it is the scale of the legendary Korean Beast known as Imugi; a mythical dragon creature. In a short while, he returns to the news studios but has a flash back of when he was a young boy and his encounter that he had with a mystical storekeeper named Jack (Robert Forster [Ancient Warlord/Sensei]).

He learns that he is the reincarnated spirit of an ancient Korean warrior-apprentice named Haram--learning the martial arts skills by the Warlord/Sensei--who has to defend Princess ""Tattoo"" Narin from all her enemies. He falls in love with her. However, his Sensei could care less because the Princess--who is now 20 years old--needs to give up her special life force to the Imugi, by scarification. They--either the good, or bad Imugi--will ascend to Dragon hood through ingestion.

Within a short while, a crisis develops in this Kingdom. The evil General as well as his Power Rangers/Storm Troopers, and most importantly the evil giant serpent arrive first and a great battle ensues. There is no escape for the couple, therefore they decide to jump off a cliff. Through their failure, their reincarnated spirits will repeat this event again in 500 years to battle the bad imugi, the evil general and his evil army.

It is present day again and now Ethan must find a girl named Sara Daniels (Amanda Brooks) with a tattoo marking of the good Imug (she is the Princess). However, this will be difficult because there are many girls at this age that fit this description. He uses the help of a co-worker to search through the computer database to help narrow his search but he eventually is able to locate her at a hospital. What will be the out come of Ethan and Sarah? Will they defeat these forces of evil?

Confused about the story? Trust us, don't even sweat it.

When seeing the preview for D-Wars I had a flashback of Destroy All Monsters, as other movies such as King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and All Monsters Attack (1969) that the Toho Company Ltd. released. As a kid these monsters were everything, even though they were just a bunch a people in rubber suits, there was artistry.

In D-Wars you can definitely see the theme of such American Science Fiction movies as The Terminator series (1984-2003) with dialog similarities between the main characters, and even the similar cinematography from King Kong (1976) and the American Godzilla (1998). Is the director paying homage to these movies or to Korean Nationalism because at the end of the film we see Shim use Korean print and Shim quotes ""D-War and I will succeed in the world market without fail?"" Keep dreaming.

We will tell you from our point of view that you cannot impress us or the world market. Especially from the American actor Robert Forster who gives us a mono log in the flash back in which he sounds like an ESL instructor, teaching a class of foreigners. The romantic chemistry that never develops from our lovers--Ethan and Sara--because they seem hopelessly confused if they even want to know each other. Should they not be able to recognize their reincarnated spirits? Where is Ethan's ability of the marital arts or even superhuman strength, he is a reincarnated warrior? He just keeps running away. Then there is the evil General along with the Atrox soilders who give us the impression of evil Power Rangers/Storm troopers from Star Wars. The General spoke and sounded like Mr. Bean. That's being funny unintentionally.

For the new generation of Asians filmmakers, people wearing rubber suit and city miniatures are something from the past. For Better or for worse, they upgraded themselves to the new computer graphics extravaganza of today. Honestly we liked the classic monster films from that period. But not everything is lost in D-Wars, one of the best moments in the film is the dragon invasion of the city where we get to see some decent monster action against the military--the creatures look pretty decent at times and really terrible at others--but the action itself is quite interesting. Let's not forget the final battle between the two dragons. The loud dragons face off and goes on for a while, but it has very little realism, but quite intense nevertheless.

Proceed with caution because if you're a fan of the B Japanese monster movies, you will be disappointed with the cheesiness of this ""upgraded"" Asian monster film. Where is the fun of the classic monsters from the past? Just because you have computer graphics, it doesn't mean that you're going to make a great film. despite some decent battle moments; the film is flat because of the hilarious acting, confusing plot and video-game special effects.

8232119,2,B000YDOOEQ,"BOTTOM LINE: The digital F/X of the monsters & destruction are the ONLY reason to bother watching this headache of a film. Overly complicated plot, dreadful script, wooden direction and & lousy acting cripple it. Even for a 'mindless giant monster movie' this one's pretty bad. Catch it free or pass. If you decide to skip this one, don't worry. You ain't missing much. 2 STARS

THE STORY: A couple of giant dragonsnake gods destroy a sizeable chunk of L.A. The bad guy snake brings along a vast army of enemy foot solider creatures who, with ample help from some bizarre-looking critters that waddle and slither through the streets, add to the collateral damage. Beyond that, I give up. You tell me.

THOUGHTS: I have to confess up front that I am quite biased about these kinds of films. I mean I really, really LOVE movies that feature giant creatures smashing cities & grappling with one another. Ever since I was a kid. And I've never outgrown that fondness. Now with that said... this film was a sanity-straining chore. The pretentious story is way too complex for its own good. There are literally flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks! Yes, you can sort of follow what's going on, but it shouldn't be this convoluted. The F/X are a mixed bag. There's some great stuff, mixed in with a lot of so-so work, and more than a few shots that are downright awful. The actors are all fairly lousy; mostly noobs who just read their lines with either no emotion, or else they're overacting so much you'd think they just teleported in from an Ed Wood flick. Only Robert Forster seems like he knows what he's doing. (And after starring in the terrific monster-on-the-loose classic, 1980's ALLIGATOR, you know he's game for - and can be great in - just about anything.) Still, the poor guy has so much expositionary dialogue & backstory pap to slog through that he may as well be sitting there reading from a history book - and he could definitely use some flow charts & graphs to help the rest of us understand just what the heck's going on. If you're Korean and have a solid grasp of your country's history then you may really enjoy this film. Everyone else is gonna be scratching their heads going ""Huh?!?"" most of the time. All I can say for those who decide to take the plunge and try to sit through this monstrous mess is that you'll likely be very grateful for the Fast Forward button long before the final fade out.

THE BLU-RAY: The film looks nice and the level of detail in the digital stuff is pretty impressive. The picture is strong & solid; little or no artifacting, edge enhancement, pixelation or crush, that I could detect. Colors are rich, mid-tones are stable and the blacks are nice and inky. Audio is equally stable & clean. A few bonus supplements are packed in but it's mostly historical info, and a LOT of stuff featuring the director, who I believe sincerely intended to make a great film, explaining (and over explaining) about the story and its cultural significance. Most of this is in Korean, with subtitles, just so you know.",1495324800,2,3059,4.6402214022140225

8232121,4,B000YDOOEQ,"A Korean fairy tale set within the framework of an American story to connect the two.

Every 500 years a sign is sent enabling a serpent to become a dragon and thereby  enter heaven, only one years, the sign is accidentally intercepted by the newborn daughter of a village leader, appearing as a birthmark on her shoulder.  On her 20th birthday, an evil serpent sends his minions to find the girl so he can kill her, take the sign, and become a dragon. To prevent this, the girl and her guard, with whom she has fallen in love, leap from a cliff into the ocean, thus thwarting the serpent's plans.  500 years later, in Los Angeles, Eathan, a young reporter, who was told as a child by an antiques dealer that he is to become the next incarnation's guardian, realizes the story is about to repeat istelf. He tries to find the girl...

The acting is good, the special effects are great, especially in the scenes where the serpent coils itself around buildings, bursting through them in his search. The battle in the city, with soldiers mounted on two-legged reptiles reminiscent of Star Wars' taun-tauns, the slow moving behemoths with cannons mounted on their backs, and dragons engaged overhead in dogfights with helicopters and fighter planes, is impressive.

The Korean story is seamlessly woven into the American one with subtitles explaining what's happening. The only flaw is that in some places there are subtitles though no one has spoken.

There are some beautiful ocean shots as well as interesting camera angles during the scenes with the dragons/serpents and the final incarnation of the serpent clearly resembles the Asian depiction of a dragon with its long whiskers, horns, and sinuous body.

If the storyline seems weak to some, a solid cast with recognizable names such as Elizabeth Pena and Chris Mulkey help make this a enjoyable film, with an unexpected ending for this type story.
