5796294,5,B00DGCIYZC,This movie is one of Hilary's best I think. Full of love and caring for kids from the world torn county of Africa. Full of emotions that will make you cry and just laugh along side of these two women. But great story of helping kids.,1384560000,,233,4.086956521739131

To see the loss of her son in Africa and then how she handles the grief and turns the grief into something that is very powerful and moving.

Given that the style and tone of the storytelling is that of docu-drama, I feel this is a serious breach of trust with the audience.  That said, the story does present truth about the plague of malaria; it is a shame that it undermines its own effectiveness by pretending to be something it is not.",1505520000,,389,4.464788732394366

The 2 women were fabulous together as actors and in helping the malaria cause. I'm happy the parents didn't break up because the death of a child can do that or bring them closer.

5796368,2,B00DGCIYZC,"I am not at all moved by this movie, not that I am coldblooded or have no sympathy on children die of Malaria, but the movie itself lacks of power to move me. For one, it is hard to like the mother. She completely ignored her child and her husband, and when she realized that her child was bullied, she abruptly brought him to Africa without her husband's agreement; and her lack of basic knowledge on a wide-spread disease in the destination country and delayed treatment led directly to her son's death. For two, perhaps a politically incorrect view, it was a tragedy that her and Martha's children were killed by the disease but the disease is very rare in the states. Why the hell should the US government spend a lot of tax money to prevent this disease? It is perfectly OK if she could raise and spend a lot of donated money or her own money if she is as rich as Bill on Malaria, but it is plain wrong to ask the government of US to spend tax money on it.",1496448000,3,961,4.228260869565218

There are movies that solely entertain and then there are movies like this that make you think and want to learn more about what you can do to help.

5796521,5,B00DGCIYZC,"Absolutely POWERFUL! This movie had great actors, and an even greater message. Malaria is often pushed to the back burner in the world today because not enough people in the United States are affected by it. This movie reminds us that all lives are precious and that the half a million people who die from malaria everyday matter. I would recommend that everyone watch this movie!",1483056000,,380,4.7727272727272725
5796522,3,B00DGCIYZC,"There were a ton of unanswered questions in this movie. Spoiler alert:

Just an example:
1) was the child taking anti-malaria drugs? It never really mentions that
2) How do nets protect at twilight when the kids seem to be out playing sports? I know mosquitoes do not just come out after dark

Not sure what to make of this movie. It was touching and brings a spotlight to a very important topic.",1482969600,,396,4.410958904109589

5796533,5,B00DGCIYZC,"Had no idea what this was about when I went into it but am a fan of Hilary Swank, so was pleasantly  surprised that it was based on a true story and on a subject that is very important but does not receive the attention it needs nor the appropriate funding. What also stood out to me was that there were no extra words, scenes, or fluff in this movie, everything said, all scenes, were of relevance so no time was wasted with ""filler"" so a lot was able to be packed into a shorter movie. It also shows how these significant tragedies effect family dynamics for better or worse. The Pilates scene where everyone was complaining about what type of car to buy and Hilary's response was spot on, and can be applied to other things in our world where there is so much small talk about things which have little importance overall compared to matters of significance that affect us all on deeper levels.",1482364800,5,896,4.397590361445783

Well written and well acted by all (I wouldn't expect anything less from Miss Swank).  Having lost a child myself, I can say the emotions and mental states of the parents involved are accurate without being too weighty and morbid for the story.  The story moves through the characters' grief and into their new purpose in life smoothly and believably.  Grief and confusion give way to redemption as the characters discover the joy and triumph of fighting for and saving others.  A wonderful story with beautiful cinematography of the African landscape.",1480636800,,720,4.966666666666667

It is not often that a movie can possibly incite activism about a problem which can actually be improved.  For the reviewer who gave a negative review and asked if they expected them to stay under the tent all the time, THE MOSQUITOES BITE AT NIGHT.  Chemcally treated nets are the most cost effective way to prevent malaria.  I don't how anyone (especially a parent) would not be moved by their plight.  It really has nothing to do with whether you are conservative or liberal, black or white or even whether you found the movie ""entertaining"" but more to do with being a decent human being.",1476921600,8,693,4.468253968253968

5796770,4,B00DGCIYZC,"I thought the movie was wonderful, beautifully acted by all.  My one criticism is that the very reason of why malaria has become such a scourge in Africa is not included in the film.  Yes, mosquito nets are good, but better is DDT spraying, which for so long has been seen as a danger to our health.  I grew up in the tropics, 1940's, 1950's when solved the mosquito problem.  During mosquito season, we were subjected to areal spray from ground trucks that sprayed foliage and from the air by spray planes.  We never came inside during spraying, having grown up with it all of our lives and my family never seemed to suffer any adverse effects from it.  Millions have died since DDT was outlawed by the Environmental Protection Agency and worldwide, but most people are unaware of this.  So in this sense, I think the movie was sympathetic to the deaths by malaria, but did not address the cause and solution of it.",1470700800,,916,4.515151515151516

Probably why HBO made it.  I was not drawn in by the acting either and I love Hillary Swank.  She was the draw and that's about it.  It was a typical story about a mother whose child dies and she champions for that cause (and there wasn't much effort depicted as far as work that they did).

Her husband is a wimp who let his crazy wife take their only son to a third world rat hole infested with malaria.
Ray Charles could have seen that her estranged father was going to help her get some face time in front of government bureaucrats.
The most intellectually offensive part of the movie is the idea that the way to fight malaria is with mosquito nets for the natives. Are they going to spend their entire lives inside a mosquito net?  Why not issue them fly swatters with the mosquito nets? The judicious use of a good pesticide like DDT would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives over the decades, but a logical and viable solution is not what the bleeding hearts want to consider.
This movie is emblematic of the pap that Hollywood liberals use to brainwash the masses. This kind of movie is why so many of us now despise Hollywood.  All emotion, no logic and no contact with reality. All who participated in the funding, production and distribution of this horror show should be pilloried.",1467158400,8,1115,4.597989949748744

This movie was based on a screenplay by Richard Curtis and was not a true story.  But I love stories true or not where tragedy is turned into a purpose for helping others.  This movie shined the light on how the World Health Organization estimates malaria killed 660,000 people in 2010, most of them African children,  but in 2015, there were an estimated 438, 000 malaria deaths.

5797078,5,B00DGCIYZC,"So many movies portray nonsense.  Meaningless scenarios or events that tend to dull, nullify, or even agitate.  But this one... This movie INSPIRES.  Slices of two perfect worlds it seems. As sometimes our own does.  Perhaps not perfect but as okay as we can make it.  We go through our daily motions, our jobs, responsibilities, etc, etc.  And then something unforeseen happens.  That, this...is life!  What is so inspiring about this particular work is the courage these two mothers gathered in a time of such utter loss and brokenness.  And, that it doesn't happen magically overnight.  Also, initially unseen, is the result of their perserverence.  They saw a desperate need and pushed through... trying to make a much needed difference.  It's a story about real people, hope, tragedy, loss and more hope!  I commend everyone who took part in the creation of this ""film"".  Beautifully written, cast, and rendered.

5797590,5,B00DGCIYZC,"This is a film that is able to wholly break your heart, and subsequently inspire you to go stand up for the neglected and destitute of this world, whom have no voice on their own. It calls out to all people of any socioeconomic background to make a change, from well-to-do families in the U.S., to humble families in the U.K.; anyone can make any impact.

I applaud this film for inducing the sense that it was entirely realistic; one might find him/herself questioning whether the film's contents actually happened in front of the camera! This speaks well to the cast. Bravo to Hilary Swank, Brenda Blethyn, Sam Claflin, Frank Grillo, and more besides.

Personally, my career ambitions concern using sociological research as a means of effectuating social change for orphans of East Africa and sex trafficking victims of Southeast Asia. This film, however, has caused me to reflect upon the simple, yet powerful reality that an individual can make an incredible impact by the mere tools of awareness, persistence, and compassion.

This film has moved to my top five favorite films.",1451433600,,1082,4.934065934065934

Hilary Swank and Brenda Blethyn turned in bravado performances playing two very strong women who found the positive in the negative after both having lost their sons to malaria in Africa.  Their friendship felt very real based on all they had been through - a bond of two women who lost their beloved children and felt the need to make things better so other people's sons didn't die.

After his death she turns her compulsive behavior into a need to save the life of an African child.  The two mothers do not handle the deaths of their sons well and nearly destroy their marriages with their need to feel useful in the face of needless deaths in Africa.  The movie focuses on the pain of these two women while just mentioning (in the last minutes of the movie) the 500,000 African children who die from malaria each year.  Unfortunately the story line of white savior is repeated in real life far too often.  A person from a rich country becomes aware of the pain in Africa and begins intensive short term effort to fix Africa.",1443312000,3,800,4.445205479452055

Is it possible that this movie, Mary and Martha  received little attention because it deals with real life and really tough problems?The same could be said of the movie,  The Homesman.  It dealt with people's lives in truly difficult times and conditions.  Maybe we just fail to appreciate talent when it presents to us the gritty aspects of human existence.

The story of Mary and Martha allows us a close insight to the grief of personal loss, suffered by each of these two remarkable women.  None of us enjoy sorrow, or tragic loss of a young person.  Stories such as this help us somehow to understand such loss apart from our own heartaches.

 I am glad this story was based on a real Martha and her real son, Harry, who died of malaria while working with children in Africa.  I wish the Martha character had been given a more active part in the development of the story for television.  Time constraints have to be considered.

5797744,3,B00DGCIYZC,"When I played this movie, I had absolutely no idea what it was about.  I only thought that the title was interesting.

So, having no idea what I was about to see, I was shocked by this movie.

There should have been more about Martha's relationship with her son, Ben.
There was a lot more about Mary and her son George.

These two women with sons, one in England and one in America, meet by chance in Africa by the middle of the movie.

The movie started out very slow, way too sugary sweet, and then suddenly changed directions so that it felt like I suddenly was watching a different movie, turning full of sadness and anger.

SPOILER ALERT..

The scenes between Mary and George in Africa were too sugary sweet to the point of annoying. I wondered if he was being bullied in school because she babied him so much.

I was shocked to see George die so suddenly.  I looked up malaria on Google, and all of the symptoms that were shown in the movie, although short and quick, were true.  Mary allowed her son to be sick for three days before getting him to the hospital because she thought that he had the flu.  If she had researched African diseases before taking George to Africa, then she would have recognized his symptoms, and she could have taken him to the hospital sooner and possibly saved his life. Or, if she had dealt with the bullying situation at home, then her son never would have been at risk for malaria in the first place. She taught her son that the solution to a problem is to run away and escape it.  She was also escaping dealing with the problems in her marriage, which made no sense, by leaving her husband.

I was also shocked that, after George died, Mary wanted to go back to Africa again. She left her husband a second time, showing no interest in his grief, or trying to deal with their grief together as a couple. The husband actually felt the need to text message his wife on her cell phone, when they are home in the house together, saying that it was his son also, instead of talking directly to her because their communication was so poor.  That was a pathetic scene. I was shocked that the husband, in his grief, never screamed at his wife to blame her for the child's death, which I was expecting.

I was also shocked that neither Mary nor Martha were concerned about getting malaria themselves.
Both Mary and Martha had unhappy marriages that they should have stayed home to deal with.
Both of them left their husbands home alone to deal with their grief alone, as if the husbands were unimportant and all that mattered was the sons who were gone.

There should have been more story about Ben.
There was a lot about George, but not enough about Ben.

The scene where Mary burst into the classroom to shout at the two little boys also shocked me. Those two boys were obviously laughing on the inside, knowing that this lady could not hurt them. She only made it worse for her son, making him look like a mama's boy in front of the entire class. If she had kept him in school, George definitely would have been bullied even more for what she did. And, if he had lived, the bullying would have been worse than ever if he returned to that school after a long vacation, which was obviously an escape from the bullying, making George look even more like a mama's boy.  I couldn't believe that the school and the two boys' parents didn't go after Mary for that inappropriate move.  Did Mary really expect that the boys were going to stop bullying her son simply because she shouted at them?

And, of course, I was shocked when I looked up malaria on Google. I had no idea about any of it.

Mary's speech was very important, but Martha's speech was more powerful by making it all feel so real with pictures instead of numbers.",1440028800,3,3754,4.395953757225434

As I'm watching, thinking, feeling the movie is not taking off I began to remember Red Dust, The Million Dollar Baby, Insomnia and other of her films, realizing Hillary has never played a mother.

Her son dies from paludism, malaria defeating all the mother's efforts for his protection. To my surprise, Miss. Swank finds another speed and her quality acting begins. She plays a very convincing distressed mother and confused wife, who is lost in a test few of us will ever encounter.

Hillary Swank is a consummated Diva of drama, her roll is most enjoyable, a bit sad but the story is rewarding in the end.

I was holding my 6 month old son while he slept and wouldn't let him go throughout the whole movie. I was so happy my son was alive and crying for fear if he had died of Malaria or something in Africa and I would feel like it's my fault and it would be.

5797964,4,B00DGCIYZC,"This film acknowledged the human struggle, as the trails of life are faced. I was inspired by the patience exemplified by the husband, as he allowed his wife to struggle through her own grieving process. He loved his wife, but not to the point he was willing to let her behavior go unchallenged, when it came to putting their marriage at risk. Initially she could not see beyond her own suffering long enough to be supportive of him. His love for her remained true, until she healed enough, she could. The strength of the wife was letting her grief, lead her to bless the lives of others.

The woman having ""potty mouth""  through the first of the film was unnecessary. I also did not like the scene, where the woman barged into her son's classroom to speak to the children who were bullying her son. She reverted to being a bully herself. Her behavior did nothing to gain the respect of anyone in the classroom including her son.

5798018,2,B00DGCIYZC,"The acting was fine. But the story presents itself as a humanitarian tale, intended to awaken your conscience to the plight of the hundreds of thousands of kids who die every year from malaria -- and it's fundamentally dishonest. The movie offers mosquito nets as a solution, and anyone who has used them in a tropical climate, as I have, will tell you that they aren't the answer. Not only do they develop tiny holes that will admit mosquitoes (as happens in the movie), but if you roll over in your sleep so that part of your body touches the net, they will bite you right through the net.

The fact of the matter is that malaria had been essentially wiped out worldwide in the 1960s, not by mosquito nets, but by the pesticide DDT. Then came the propaganda campaign against its use, one of the first hoaxes of its kind. DDT use was either banned, or so strongly discouraged by the US,that its use was discontinued in countries all over the world. It has been estimated that campaign against DDT resulted in the deaths of 20 million children. We ought to dig up Rachel Carson and put her on trial.",1418342400,8,1099,4.467661691542289
5798019,5,B00DGCIYZC,"Excellent coverage, with a personal, tragic bent. Having lived and worked in Africa I was struck by the authenticity of this film. Yes, half a million people die from malaria every year (more than all US deaths related to terrorist attacks and every war the US has sent troops to since 1967) and these deaths are preventable. The US should do a lot more than it does to combat malaria. We need to drop the notion that we are the center of the universe, and the film tries to do that by showing how the deaths of 2 westerners led their families to fight for the children of Africa. Almost all malaria deaths occur in Africa. The people of Africa are just as valuable as the people of the US. They are all our children.

I have friends who run an orphanage in Liberia, so the story hit me on multiple levels, but what amazed me was my ignorance about malaria.

5798072,5,B00DGCIYZC,"Excellent portrayal of a very tragic & sad situation. I agree with most of K. Harris's articulate review, although I do feel compelled to point out that the ""American theme of rich white people saving the day"" (paraphrased) isn't quite fair. I've never understood the apparent contempt some have for ""do-gooders,"" especially if they get the job done. Would you have everyone reject help simply because it's offered by someone with the means to offer it? It's a curious thing, this objection to ""rich white people saving the day.""  Personally, I believe that if one has the resources, they should use them to help others less fortunate, regardless of the race, nationality, or gender of either.  While ""R.W.P."" are by no means the only ones making a difference in the betterment of humanity, (quite the contrary) there are many movies about all types of people making a difference, & I think anyone who wants & tries to should be encouraged whether they ""start out as a do-gooder"" OR are ""thrust into the circumstances.""

I do agree that ""Mary and Martha"" is an emotionally charged, very well acted & written movie. While Ms. Swank gave her usual strong, uncompromising performance, I was even more taken with Ms. Blethyn.  She was completely convincing, & seemed like someone I'd like to know~ strong & wise, but also compassionate & kind.  Both women gave stellar performances, & the supporting actors were solid.  More importantly, the movie brought much needed attention to one of many neglected issues in the world today, the needless suffering & death caused by Malaria.  ~LHS",1412035200,71,1581,4.943396226415095

The lead actresses are both talented performers and bring truth to their characters as individuals. However, the film's proportions seem to go awry. A relationship between Mary and her son is exceptionally well developed. Yet, Martha and her son seem to largely be strangers to us. Mary and Martha's relationship is more eluded to than seen as the film skips over time.

5798118,5,B00DGCIYZC,"For me, this was surprisingly written by Richard Curtis, who pens some of the most engaging comedies and romantic comedies to date; Love Actually, Pirate Radio, About Time, and Bridget Jones' Diary, among many others. Here, Curtis writes an Original HBO Movie about grieving and the emotional turmoil of two completely different women. One, a married American interior designer and the other a married English homemaker, caught in the same circumstance far beyond their control or belief.  Director Phillip Noyce brings a heart wrenching story with a point while developing Hilary Swank into a steadfast woman (Mary) behind a cause that must be near and dear to her own heart to have rendered such a superb performance. Martha (Brenda Blethyn) is equally shattered, feeling helpless and hopeless as she returns to the continent of Africa only to meet an inconsolable Mary.

These two mothers have lost their only children to Malaria, a preventable disease with the proper prior considerations.  Mary lost her young child, George (Lux Haney-Jardine), during a six-month homeschooling type sabbatical due to bullying at his school.  Martha's son, Ben (Sam Claflin), decided to take a teaching position there arriving at the same end as young George.  These two mothers cannot get their former lives back to anywhere near normal as the plight in Africa is ever looming.  With some aid from Mary's emotionally distant father (James Woods) being somewhat politically connected, these brave and tenacious women advance the cause of stopping malaria from sweeping Africa in epidemic proportions.  They find a rekindled spark in their personal lives and support from their husbands which they had held at a distance in their intense grief. Watching the direction that Mary and Martha take towards this humanitarian crisis is quite powerful in many parts, one being the speech that Mary gives to procure more funding for the cause.  Simply amazing ...

In this film, the mothers did not head straight in with all of the knowledge of malaria and being bent on changing it.  These two are struggling so deeply to find their way back from the grief of their tragedies which are gripping them.  This being the body of the movie.  The world horribly stretched out and struck them, now they are left to find a reason to give their particular situation a purpose - and a reason for changing it.  The script is powerful and emotionally charged but also delicately written in this direction and I could definitely appreciate its point of view.

Because the theme of the movie is so dark and difficult to watch, I went through tissues like everyone else surely will if you are the emotional type.  On the upbeat, the African views (Roberto De Angelis) were superlative.  The continent seems to show off for the camera quite easily.  The terrific and vastly different music (Philip Miller) was a joy to hear.  Give a listen to their take on Country/Western music (I loved the beauty of it).  The blending of the former along with the staunchly African beats was an enthusiastic twist and quite a treat, mainly in the first half of the story.  Then be ready if you are at all like me to have some tears falling from the terrific writing, direction and acting while showing what could possibly be done about this growing crisis.",1403222400,18,3306,4.943942133815551
