8544217,5,B000SDSYBQ,Fun at any age! I now know how to twist balloons! I work as an entertainer and needed to learn a new skill. This is it! You and or your kids will have loads of fun! The instructor made it easy and talked you through the basics of the easy characters and then moved you through to the harder characters with ease. I am still learning these techniques for more fun.,1243123200,,363,4.126760563380282
