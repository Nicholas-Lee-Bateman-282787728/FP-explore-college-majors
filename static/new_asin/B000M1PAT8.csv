8165623,1,B000M1PAT8,"As above.  I'm sure this is a great DVD/instructions to have and refer too.  However, there is ZERO English subtitles.  I mean.. Zero.  the intro has a few, and that is it.  If you know German, this will be great for you.  if not and hoping to read the English version, you are SOL.",1482969600,,282,4.12962962962963
8165624,1,B000M1PAT8,"Agree with the 2 reviews previously written. It's more than deceptive, it's useless. I guess I need to haul in the little old German lady from down the street to translate. Don't say you can select English if it doesn't translate every word into English.",1234310400,,254,4.666666666666667
8165625,2,B000M1PAT8,"The DVD is basically one long video of a talking head (Mr. Burba, I believe). If the head were talking English it wouldn't be so bad but the head speaks German. If you select the English version at the start of the DVD you get a few English sub titles scattered through but not enough to matter, its still a German speaking talking head. There are some demos but they are introduced and summarized by Mr. Burba but, again, the summarization is in German so its impossible to understand what is being demoed and why. The DVD packaging has paragraphs in English and German, side by side, but this is deceptive.",1210982400,,608,4.486486486486487
8165626,1,B000M1PAT8,"You're offered one option for German or English, prior to the introduction.  You get English subtitles, which is okay.  After the intro, you get the guru in German.  One subtitle every five minutes or so.  If you speak German, this is probably a valuable DVD.  Come on, Amazon, you should have told us this in the blurb.  Again -- if you don't speak German, don't buy this.",1203811200,,373,4.492537313432836
