3027164,5,B000YDQ57K,This movie is hilarious.  I've watch it over and over again and love sharing it with my friends.  And you have to watch it with the commentary at least once.  And go through the artifacts in the extras too.  Well made DVD.,1194998400,2,222,4.214285714285714
3027165,5,B000YDQ57K,"This is sure to become a Christmas classic!

I was laughing out loud at this engaging and terrific mockumentary!

MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1194998400,7,138,5.2272727272727275
3027166,5,B000YDQ57K,"This movie is hilarious!  I saw it at a screening and I lauged so hard.  It is one of those movies that has the subtlties that really suck you in and make you laugh harder the more you think about it.  I knew that I really liked it when I was quoting from it the next day with my friends.  In my opinion there are very few ""Christmas Classics"" like a Christmas Story and maybe Elf but I think I am going to have to include this as one of them because I think the more I watch it the more I will enjoy it.  Make sure you watch whats going on in the back ground when watching it that is where some of the best stuff happens not the main action but how everyone reacts to it.  I give it 5 stars for originality and fun quirky humor that will have you joking with your friends every Christmas season.",1194566400,6,796,3.94375
3027167,4,B000YDQ57K,"I saw this movie last night and it was really enjoyable.  The characters are fun and the subject is interesting.  It's a little out there, but still good for a laugh.  I'm excited to watch the outtakes and the commentary on the DVD. It's definitly a movie worth seeing.",1194393600,5,269,4.448979591836735
3027238,5,B000YDQ57K,It has been a long time since I have laughed this hard at a movie!  Hilarious and fun for the entire family!,1364256000,,108,3.909090909090909
3027239,2,B000YDQ57K,"I cannot write a review on the DVD because I cannot play it! We didn't know your DVD player has to be able to play DVD's from a different region! Waiting weeks for it to arrive and then not being able to play it was very disappointing. ""Playback Prohibited by area limitations"" was all we could watch on the blue screen:( Be sure when buying a DVD that it is formatted for the region you live in. Our sellers were most kind to us and we learned a lesson.",1357257600,,454,4.112359550561798
3027240,5,B000YDQ57K,This is hilarious! Really funny. On each viewing you notice little things you missed the first time. The wife is a hoot!,1353888000,,120,4.5
3027241,3,B000YDQ57K,I thought that the video would be funnier than it was.  Kind of a silly film.  We only wathced it once.,1327363200,,103,3.857142857142857
3027242,5,B000YDQ57K,"I'd heard a review of this obscure little indie mockumentary that was full of praise, but I wasn't expecting it to be as hysterically funny as it was. I also hadn't expected it to have been filmed in Utah (where we live), but we got a kick out of seeing some places we recognize in the film. I wish it had received more marketing - it's a total gem!",1296864000,,349,4.072463768115942
3027243,5,B000YDQ57K,"This is a very funny movie, but the humor was very subtle.  The in-your-face jokes are few, and a lot of the humor is in the conversations and in the editing.  William Shatner compliments the mockumentary style of the movie perfectly.  My 11 year-old nephew is at the age where he is questioning the existence of Santa.  He watched this movie and kept asking if the movie was real.  I kept saying, ""I don't know, is it?""  It was fun.  I liked this movie and will be showing it around to other people next Christmas.",1200700800,4,515,4.3578947368421055
3027244,1,B000YDQ57K,"I could not have been more disappointed in a DVD.  I was expecting some sort of a movie like other Christmas movies, but this was one of the most boring wastes of time I have ever seen.  I would really like my money back.  No stars for this one!!!",1199232000,3,247,4.0
3027245,1,B000YDQ57K,"I'm a Christmas movie lover, but this movie is the worst excuse of a movie I have ever seen.  It's just plan dumb!  Poorly filmed and acted. Don't waste your money!",1196985600,4,164,4.258064516129032
3027246,5,B000YDQ57K,"I saw the NYC screening a few weeks ago, and damn, this is a funny funny movie. I bought four copies, so that I could send them to my brothers and their families.

I have nothing aginst 'The Christmas Story' or 'Christmas Vacation' or 'Its a Wonderful Life', but it's nice to have a new instant Christmas classic with such a quirky sense of humor and indie-movie sensibilities.

Who'd have guessed that there's actually a big government conspiracy to cover up the existence of Santa Claus? Now we know! Thank god for William Shatner for shedding some light on the situation. LOL",1195603200,9,578,4.6568627450980395

8232234,4,B000YDQ57K,"It is a very funny movie; I loved the conspiracy theory references.  I bought it to show my grandchildren but realized they wouldn't get most of the allusions and jokes so it isn't necessarily for kids.  It is totally G rated but children would probably not know about area 51 and the x-files,  My husband and I enjoyed it however.",1482278400,,331,4.483333333333333
8232235,5,B000YDQ57K,"One of my favorite Christmas movies.  Yes, it is absurd and that's the fun of it.  This movie is satire of all the investigative documentaries out there searching for everything from Big Foot to Loch Ness Monster.  Some parts make me laugh so hard it hurts.  I bought this a couple of years ago for myself and have revisited it and just bought several as gifts for friends. This movie isn't for everybody; but if your game to go along for the ride it is great.",1478476800,,460,4.313953488372093
8232236,4,B000YDQ57K,"You have to have a certain sense of humor for this one, but our family with three teenage girls love it.  It is a mockumentary, and we have made it a family tradition to watch every year at Christmas.  For those of you who have children, it does not ruin the belief in Santa.  Also, this movie is squeaky clean with no bad language, sexual innuendos, or violence.  Just family fun!",1431561600,2,381,4.323943661971831

8232240,1,B000YDQ57K,"But I think it was meant to be? Like a shtiky, tongue-in-cheek kind-of satire?
But really, bad. Even if you like Bill Shatner corny comedy, stick to the Priceline commercials- they're better.",1395187200,,191,5.0

8232242,4,B000YDQ57K,A tender and humorous look at adults' beliefs in Santa Claus.  We especially love the scenes filmed at our favorite burger joint.,1390953600,,129,4.863636363636363
