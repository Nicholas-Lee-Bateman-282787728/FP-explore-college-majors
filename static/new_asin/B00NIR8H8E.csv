8678461,4,B00NIR8H8E,"Great representation of what Transatlantic does live...well, mostly live.  Give it 3.5 stars with a roundup to 4.

First off, the positives.
* Finally a bluray recording of a great band playing really good music
* Great recording and editing: lots of angles, cams, and interesting shots, keeping the energy but not jumping around TOO much either
* The music of Transatlantic (including ""My New World"", probably my favorite Transatlantic song)

Some negatives
* As already pointed out, the mix is off at times.  In the past I've found Mike Portnoy's drums (especially with Dream Theater) were overly compressed and loud.  Not the case here.  They're often not loud enough.  Is it a show-stopper?  No, but it is unfortunate given the rest of the quality of the video
* Heavy selection of Kaleidoscope tunes on this.  Admit this is only a slight negative for ME because I wasn't so crazy about the 2 big songs off of Kaleidoscope.  Can't say I dislike them, but I definitely favor other songs in the catalog more
* I suspect it should be called ""Kalmostliveoscope"" because I'm pretty sure at least parts of the vocals were re-recorded in a studio after-the-fact. Two points flagged me on this possibility: 1) the Transatlantic live vocal harmonies have never sounded this good (check out their first ""Live in Europe"" DVD in comparison) and 2) whenever someone is singing in a ""live"" video and you see them pull away from the microphone but still hear their voice.  Microphones transmit sound based on how close a sound source is, and as soon as that sound source (like a voice) moves away from the mike, the volume should drop correspondingly to the person's voice pulling away from the mike.  There are a couple parts in the video where one of the guys singing pulls away from the mike, but the voice is still easily heard.

Which leads me to general philosophical question.  Would you rather have a live recording that is truly live (warts and all) or an almost live recording that has had substantial fixing in post-production, but is much more listenable (and therefore SELL-able)?  I guess for me, it depends on how fixing is done post production.  I've read in several publications (Electronic Musician, Sound on Sound) that a lot of live rock recordings are rarely truly live (without some substantial post-production tweaking)...and so it goes.

Still, very cool to see all the guys play their respective instruments in hi def, and for me, other than the mix and song selection detractors, it was still worth the purchase.",1446854400,,2527,4.839534883720931

8678466,5,B00NIR8H8E,"I thought this was a fantastic live representation of the great Kaleidoscope album on-tour.  I did not notice any audio problems as another reviewer observed.  But then again, I always put on the headphones and listen to the studio recording if I expect audio perfection - and I don't do that too often these days.  Also includes a great version of one of my favorite Transatlantic songs: ""My New World"".  The behind the scenes tour info was fun and the other extras were cool as well.  I somewhat disliked the fact that they tried medleys of ""The Whirlwind"" and ""All of the Above / Stranger In Your Soul"".  So if you want complete versions of those on DVD, get the Whirld Tour Live in London DVD which is also excellent and HIGHLY recommended.  I think Genesis came to the conclusion (after the We Can't Dance-tour, was it???  1992??) that die-hard fans don't take kindly to live medleys of the classics.  Portnoy explained this was a necessity due to the average T/A song being about 30 minutes !!!  Still, tremendous fun here.  Well worth the price for any prog fan.",1420243200,2,1069,4.603174603174603
8678467,4,B00NIR8H8E,"What have started as a side project is now 15 years later a permanent band with 4 albums and live dvds, the latest ""Kalivesoscope"" is taken from the album title ""Kaleidoscope"". To illustrate the concept, the band decide to include in the back a screen with visuals of constant moving forms. The band started their career live tour with medleys of covers because they didn't have enough material to make it a complete concert. Now they have to do medleys of their own songs, because they have too much material. So the band played a ""Whirlwind"" medley and a encore of medley of ""All of the Above"" and Stranger in Your Soul"". The songs are long, but they did squeeze in some shorter and lighter song to get a nice flow to the show.

When you know all of the previous albums and songs from the band, it's normal to enjoy a bit more the new songs from the latest album. The music has always been a continuation of Neal Morse's solo music with long symphonic epic, but in song like ""Behind The Sun"", Roine Stolt can brings his output from Flower Kings. Ted Leonard of Spock's Beard and Enchant replace Daniel Gildenlow playing guitars and vocals. We can appreciate his nice voice despite the more present vocals of Neal Morse. It was interesting to include in the extras some covers versions of ""Sylvia"" and ""Hocus Pocus"" with Thijs Van Leer of Focus, taken from another show in Tilburg. The extras also contains a interview and a behind the scenes of the world tour with a long segment of the Progressive Nation at Cruise with Adrian Belew and Jon Anderson playing with the band.

8678468,2,B00NIR8H8E,"Don't get me wrong...this is a great band with plenty to offer, however they have been let down rather badly by the production crew on this effort. What should have been a thoroughly enjoyable concert was mixed very badly...the bass guitar is way over the top, keyboards are barely audible and Portnoy's usually thunderous drum work sounded as if it were coming from the next room. The cymbals were not audible at all. All this and major 'out of sinc' problems to boot. My surround system is the best available that Krix has to offer in home theatre. If the editing and mixing have been done correctly it literally blows you away...not so here. Feeling very disappointed to say the least! Back to the drawing board boys!",1414972800,16,720,4.677165354330708
