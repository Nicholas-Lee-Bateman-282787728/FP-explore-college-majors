3722601,5,B001NPD9OA,"Even if you did catch the Jonas Brothers on their Burning Up Tour last summer (like I did), this is STILL worth the purchase. It's like reliving the surge of excitement over and over again. It never gets old. It's got tons of behind the scene stuff, plus it has 2 bonus songs which were NOT released in the theaters.

If you're a JB fan, and did NOT get to catch them on their Burning Up Tour, then I don't know what you're waiting for! ORDER THIS DVD and experience Kevin, Joe, and Nick up close and personal.  Honestly, isn't that what EVERYYYYY Jonas Brother fan wants? :P",1249257600,2,575,4.314814814814815
3722602,5,B001NPD9OA,If your a major fan like me then you ll love it. Whats more to say. The Jonas Brothers Rock !!!,1249257600,,95,3.5714285714285716
3722603,1,B001NPD9OA,"ok The jonas r basicly borring and kind of wierd. Their songs r stupid and i hate their program too, waste of time. Good Day Jonas fans. Even the hannah montana concert is better Duhhhhhhh!",1247616000,2,189,4.428571428571429
3722604,5,B001NPD9OA,"I ordered this DVD for my daughter on behalf of her grandparents. My oldest daughter just celebrated her 15th birthday and she has special needs. Going to concerts isn't very realistic for her. I think it would be overwhelming and too loud.  She loves music though and like most girls her age she likes the Jonas Brothers.  The DVD came yesterday and her younger sister and I put it on and watched it with her.  Her smile on her face said it all. It was like she was at the concert herself.  I did get the regular non 3-D movie so I imagine the 3-D is even more fun to watch.
This DVD made my daughters day. Made her grandparents look cool and for that alone I give it 5 Stars.  The music is pretty good and done live.
Taylor Swiff does a song as well as Demi Lavato.",1246665600,2,767,4.120805369127517
3722605,5,B001NPD9OA,this is a great movie it has lots of great songs from the burnin' up tour and special guests demi lavato and taylor swift who's songs were good as well! the jonas brothers are awsome!,1246492800,,183,4.257142857142857
3722606,5,B001NPD9OA,"I would highly recommend this to any Jonas Brothers fan who can't get enough of them.  Knowing how expensive (and coveted) their concert tickets are, this gives you a behind the scenes, front row thrill.  Nothing beats seeing them live (seriously, nothing compares!), but the 3D is a close second.
I saw this opening night in LA and the boys stopped by to play us an acoustic set...not your average night at the movies!  Needless to say, I enjoyed every minute of the film and sang along to every word.  I went to their tour the day before this concert was filmed, so I felt like I was reliving the summer tour.  Also, don't be fooled by some of the fan sequences -- just watching all the screaming, running fans is entertaining in itself, even if I am one myself!",1246147200,5,764,4.428571428571429
3722607,5,B001NPD9OA,What a great movie I got to see them on the burin up tour and I had a blast at the concert I am hoping that they have A little bit longer and also same of the songs that they did in concert that they didn't have in the movie. I saw them in July 08 and I am seeing again in Aug this year and I am so excited to see them again in concert.,1245801600,,336,3.4342105263157894
3722608,4,B001NPD9OA,So fun to watch and sing along to. Really gets into their personal lives a little too which is fun to see(:,1383523200,,107,3.909090909090909
3722609,5,B001NPD9OA,This movie is an incredible and emotional experience for all the die hard Jonas fans out there. I could watch it over and over again.,1381708800,2,133,4.36
3722610,5,B001NPD9OA,"I like Jonas Brothers they have a good voice and they are good singers.  I like it because is a DVD. If it is a VHS I will not enjoy it.

3722613,1,B001NPD9OA,the jonas brothers have no talent at all you call this real music when in reality its not iv been listening to heavy metal and thrash metal bands for a long time and this dvd is pure trash and garbage the jonas brothers are annoying and people actually beileve the jonas brothers have talent when in reality they have no talent at all the jonas brothers are a rading fade that will soon fade to black and prove real musicians like dave mustaine kirk hammett john petrucci jimmy page steve vai etc etc etc etc etc are the real musicians who will live on forever long live classic rock and heavy metal music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1326499200,,641,4.68141592920354
3722614,5,B001NPD9OA,I bought this for my 4-year old daughter because she had seen it on cable and was mesmerized by the concert; she loves to dance to the songs and sings along!,1298332800,,157,4.096774193548387
3722615,5,B001NPD9OA,Never heard their music before.  Thought I would take a chance and see what it was all about.  It was very cute and good for the whole family to watch.,1291766400,,151,4.0
3722616,5,B001NPD9OA,"Boght as a Christmas present for a young girl.  She was thrilled, but her parents quickly got tired of hearing it after about 23 playings.  :-)",1290988800,,143,4.461538461538462
3722617,5,B001NPD9OA,"I've been a huge fan for a while now, but hadn't gotten a chance to see them live until recently because they'd only been in Ireland once, supporting Avril Lavigne. When I got this DVD for my birthday, I was absolutely delighted. It gave me a chance to experience the excitement of their concert. And what a concert it was...

In my opinion, you really can't decide whether you like a band/artist without seeing them live first, and this is an excellent example why.

The Jonas Brothers are brilliant performers. They rarely stand still, and their excitement is infectious. The 3D option makes the movie feel more intimate, like you're up there on stage with them.

Anyways, as I was saying before, if you haven't seen them live then this is a great opportunity to see what it's like from the comfort of your living room. If you, like me, have seen them live then it's a great way to relive the experience.

I rate this movie 10/10 no doubt. I've watched it too many times to count and it never gets boring.

(And how cute is Nick when he's just woken up? Awwww!!)",1278028800,,1064,4.463917525773196
3722618,5,B001NPD9OA,Love JoBros.. and I'm 23! Great behind the scenes! Great concert! I saw it live and it was like being there again!,1272844800,,114,4.2272727272727275
3722619,1,B001NPD9OA,"Okay, this is how bad this is.
The ""Jonas Brothers"" is aimed at eight to fourteen year old girls (I guess).
My four girl cousins I grew up close to  all loved ""Tiger Beat""  (Lisa Simpson's ""Non-Threatening Boys Magazine"" is my favorite parody), so I understand the pre-teen girl giggles over attractive young males.
The Jonas Brothers: So these guys sing, have guitars, groovy outfits, and a protective Mom, whom they kick out of their dressing room when they are doing ""shirt-off"" wardrobe changes because ...well...they are just too-sexy-for-their-own-Mom!
So....we got this video for free, as a gift, from a Disney executive, when he heard that we had an eight year old daughter who liked Hannah Montana.
Again, this is how bad this is.
After watching 30 minutes of it she got up from the couch, and started playing with toy cars on the floor with her five year old little brother.
She tried to watch a little bit more of it, and we let it keep playing while my wife did needlepoint and I read my book. The music was ""non-threatening"" enough.
So I asked her: ""what did you think?""
MyLittleGirl: ""Dad, that was sooooo boring. The whole thing was about how cool they are and how popular they are, but it is all so fake.""
This girl is eight.
""I never want to see it again.""
This girl is eight. We have watched The Hannah Montana movie eight times.
""Their music was terrible. All they did was thrash around like they were sooo cool and feeling sooo much. I mean, nobody is like that.""
This is an eight year old girl, living in the French countryside, not some jaded NYC/LA kid.
Now she is nine. I was cleaning out some old stuff and she saw the box. This is a new Blu-Ray Disc....and she said ""throw that away. Ugh! Boy that was terrible!""
This video recounts the implausible story of the three Jonas brothers, in their quest to stimulate the release of sex hormones in your pre-teen daughter by simulating ....ahhhh....""self-abuse""  with their electric guitars, taking their shirts off for costume changes backstage, and juggling their affluent lifestyle with being adored and hounded celebrities, all while being down-to-earth good boys next door.
Perhaps this video is actually aimed at the Cougar market.",1271030400,3,2207,4.7421875

3722626,2,B001NPD9OA,"It is true.  People are actually calling the Jonas Brothers the second coming of the Beatles.  Here is a simple compare and contrast of the Jonas Brothers and the Beatles
Reasons for fame:
The Beatles got their fame by sheer talent, and being good at what they do.
The Jonas brothers got their fame by being sponsored by Disney and being very attractive
Music:
The Beatles actually made rock music
The Jonas brothers say they are making Rock music but it is clearly only Pop music

The Jonas brothers have nothing in common with the Beatles, and more than likely the Jonas brothers are just a phase.  Sooner or later some new boyband will  come along and kick the Jonas brothers out of their fame.  They will end up like the Naked Brothers band: doing free concerts at schools and having all their old fans say ""Ohh yah I remember them.  They used to be really cool, but (insurt boy band) are way cooler and much hotter.",1252627200,3,920,4.473053892215569
3722627,4,B001NPD9OA,"We attended a Jonas Brothers concert on this Burnin' Up tour. It was at the height of their appeal with my daughter and her friends. The show was spectacular, the girls had the time of their lives --- I even loved it, and I've seen a lot of concerts! So we had to see the movie when it came out. And we had to buy this DVD to relive the memories of a fantastic summer night in 2008. Some of the scenes that are not the concert footage are a bit goofy and contrived, but we bought it for the concert. Of course, nothing can recreate the actual concert experience, or even the 3D possible in theaters but not at home. Still, a worthy addition!",1250812800,2,641,4.136
