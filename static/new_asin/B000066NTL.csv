Just a good all around program & it was a shame it ended after two season (series).  I'm complaining here because it's not available for US DVD players & it hasn't been on Ovation in ages.  Please convert the format for US DVD players, or at the very least, get it back on Ovation once in a while!",1521676800,,436,4.166666666666667
7962385,3,B000066NTL,"While the show's premise and earlier episodes show a bit of promise--a diverse group sit around and talk about books--the series unravels into a cross between ""Friends"" and ""Girls."" The most realistic characters are the footballers as pretentious angst takes over in the lives of the book club members. By the second series (which if you make it through the first six episodes of this one) goes completely far afield suffering most from the introduction of Claire's sister and a string of meaningless relationships. By the time one of those characters is wanking in a scene, you realize that the writers themselves have been doing the same. This is a series, unfortunately, that despite its pretension is not a classic.",1495324800,,719,5.0
7962386,5,B000066NTL,"done right.  I enjoyed watching this show and cannot wait for the second series.  It's about a transplanted american trying to find her way in the social scene in Glasgow where soccer reigns supreme.  Snappy dialogue, interesting characters and the twists in sub-plots made for fascinating viewing.  Why aren't more smart comedies like these made in the U.S.?  There is an audience waiting......",1147824000,9,395,5.2063492063492065
7962387,5,B000066NTL,"Well I would say that wouldn't I? As they choose Kerouac's

On The Road as their first book for discussion. But seriously

(and I was being serious)- it's a lovely sit-com, or whatever

you might call it. Wonderful actors, brilliant script, - and

Annie Griffin - are you married? I found it very engaging,

- the Scottish footballer's wife Michelle Gomez is outstanding

(or do I mean entrancing?)- both! They're all great, brilliant

British production, shame it was made by a Yank!

(only joking).",1147132800,4,500,4.869047619047619
