4860051,4,B005QUQREM,"A year's worth of PPV events of the top UFC for $80 prime?  you can't do better than this.

if you're like me and you're not dropping $50 a pop for PPV this collection is worth it.
Slightly disappointed it's not Blu ray, but the price is right and it still looks good.",1323475200,3,268,4.037735849056604
4860052,3,B005QUQREM,"This is a collection of fights that occured between July 2010 and June 2011.  It is a 20 disc set and shows Pay-Per-View fights, Fight Nights (free events original aired on Spike TV), and UFC Live (which originally aired on Versus network).  It also includes some of the unaired prelim fights.

It also includes some bonus material like: ""Best of Fight School"", ""Best of Rogan 1-on-1"", and ""Best of Unguarded""

While all of that sounds great, there are some downsides:
- For some reason the fights are not in chronological order.  They are separated with all the PPV fights together, all of the Ultimate Fight Nights grouped together, and all of the UFC Live events together.  This means you be watching a fight and in the analysis they are discussing how someone did in a fight you haven't watched yet.

- The other big drawback, and for me this was a deal breaker, not all the fights are shown.  About 45 fights in all are not included in this package.  I am sure it was a timing and space thing but I am personally am a ""completionist""....and I want every fight.

As I said, it will be a great set for some and it does provide every title fight in the year as well as a lot of other great action...but it is not a complete set.  For those that don't care about having it all, definitely purchase this product...for people like me, you may want to pass",1321315200,19,1354,4.419354838709677

8483782,4,B005QUQREM,"Wonderful collection.  While the set does not have extras as others have stated in previous reviews, it does contain clips of pre and post fight press conferences of the co-main and main events.  Very good quality product.  The only complaint I have is that the discs are in cardboard sleeves which make the discs more prone to scratches.  So be careful removing the discs and putting them back in.  Other than that, I have no complaints.",1467763200,,438,4.7105263157894735
8483783,5,B005QUQREM,"These collections are all good for the price.  They do edit out the less exciting fights so if you want the complete program, get the individual event DVD's.  The 2011 discs are not in chronological order with the non-PPV's events at the end of the string of DVD's.",1430265600,,265,4.5

8483788,5,B005QUQREM,It's a great collection of UFC events and weed out some of the best fights from the year. Great DVD presentation and very well put together. The only negative is that the DVD are not in Chronological order and they miss out on some of the Ultimate Fighter finales. For the most part its an awesome collection and has some very memorable moments! Highly Recommend!!!,1358035200,,365,4.630769230769231

8483790,4,B005QUQREM,"an absolutely amazing collection of fights, so no problem there. the main and only issue of the entire dvd set is the fact that some of the original entrances have had their music changed. an example is Brock Lesnar entrance at UFC 121 was originally ""enter sandman"" has been changed to some 80's metal song. other than that buy it",1324944000,2,331,4.533333333333333
