8623956,4,B00GJVUTIW,"If you are to drop $15 on this movie, here's what to expect. The packaging is very disappointing. Instead of a protective plastic DVD case with a nice cover art, the DVD comes in a thin cardboard sleeve that is fragile. (See photo) My new copy is damaged on arrival because the seller (MightySilver) used a bubble envelope instead of a small cardboard box. However, the DVD is intact. If you're a fan of cardboard sleeves, I wouldn't recommend buying it used. Buying it new is risky, but it's your best bet. The movie is French with English subtitles. There is no option to turn off the subtitles; they are integrated in the video. The subtitles are tiny white text with no black outlines. They are incredibly difficult to read when the scene takes place in a bright environment. The description on Amazon claims the DVD is Region 1. It is actually Region 0, but it will play on any computer or DVD player. The admittedly twisted movie itself is totally worth $15. It is full of hilariously dark humor. Enjoy!",1486771200,,1009,4.580110497237569
8623957,1,B00GJVUTIW,"The last three First Run Features that I have received, arrived in cardboard sleeves, marred and scratched: ""It's not me, I swear,"" ""Brownian movement,"" and ""God loves Uganda.""  These are regular priced items.  I've written FRF about the inadequacy of this packaging, but they haven't responded.  It doesn't appear to be through any failing of Amazon or the shipping company that I am failing to receive undamaged product.  Of course I can return them, but why would that be an appropriate sequence to engage in over and over again?  Those responsible for this, need to provide protective covers for their product.  I'm all for avoiding unnecessary plastic, and eliminating oversized packaging--but a minimal requirement for packaging is that it takes care of the product it contains.  Really.  How much profit would be sacrificed by placing each disc inside a Tyvek envelope, within the cardboard packaging?",1400803200,,908,5.213793103448276
8623958,5,B00GJVUTIW,"Beautifully filmed during summer in a suburb of Montreal, this film presents the story of 10-year old Leon who is struggling with dysfunctional family issues and erratic and dangerous scenes of acting out.  Vandalism is his past-time and he has learned to lie from his mother, who proclaims that lying badly is only worse than lying.

When his parents divorce and his mother moves to Greece, Leon's family begins to feel the pain, particularly Leon.  Leon acts out his frustration in numerous destructive and sometimes humorous ways.  He has no regard for his neighbors and is delighted when they are on vacation, leaving their house an easy target for anything he wants to do.
During this period he befriends Lea, a young girl dealing with her own family issues.  Together they hatch plans that lead them into dangerous local territory.

The acting is superb and the storyline is often darkly funny, as much as it is truthfully and painfully sad.  The adventures Leon and Lea embark on as youngsters can be frightening at times, but the end result is an eccentric and offbeat film, both funny and sometimes unbearably real.  Full of twists and interesting character development, this film begs a watch.  Film provided by First Run Features for review.",1391644800,3,1252,4.923809523809524
