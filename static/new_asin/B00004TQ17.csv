7923018,5,B00004TQ17,"I'll have to agree with the other reviewer. As much as abdominals videos are usually suspect, this is information put forth in a straightforward manner about training the core. You'll learn how to get six pack abs to be sure, but you more importantly get a good understanding of how and why to exercise the muscles that stabilize your torso.

It's solid, useful information that is well presented.

Addendum: It's information that is presented in a way that makes sense to a personal trainer. All sorts of exercises are shown, and how they are done right. But the perspective might bother the casual user. Not me, though.",1114560000,4,621,4.794392523364486
7923019,5,B00004TQ17,"I have gone through a lot of six-pack ab theories but this video shows you the way to gaining a powerful core without the kind of excess reps that lead to lower back or neck pain. When you do it right, less is more. The parts using a swiss ball are challenging. Paul Chek is a great trainer who knows what he is talking about. The presentation is done in a gym setting without any annoying backround music. I've tryed his techniques for a few weeks now and I can see and feel the difference.",987379200,32,491,4.178947368421053
