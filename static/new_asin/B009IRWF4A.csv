8542113,5,B009IRWF4A,Great!!!  I just sat down and watched this with my son and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love movies with a message.  This one tells us just because something or someone is different you don't have to fear or hate them.  Take the time to get to know them with kindness and understanding even when you will be facing your own fears along with it.  With that said its a great movie for kids and adults.  Enjoy!!!,1403308800,,406,4.276315789473684

8542115,3,B009IRWF4A,This was very cute but should have been bundled with other things to make a decent length DVD.  Or add it to a full length movie as an extra.,1392076800,2,141,3.8620689655172415
8542116,2,B009IRWF4A,was like 15 minutes long............was disappointed.  The 15 minutes also included largely repetative information portrayed in the movie.  It was just a real let down after such a fantastic movie.,1385942400,,197,5.533333333333333
8542117,2,B009IRWF4A,"I got this because I liked "" how to train your dragon "" - which was a good film.
no write up by anyone - which is all to often - so assumed it was a movie
like the last one.
 run time 17 min - seventeen !  not a misprint or typo.
the second menu Item is play online - which I didn't check out.
this just goes thru a bunch of cartoon dragons in a silly way, hit fwd x2 to
speed up the process hopeing there was a movie afterwards - nope.
 So - just be aware /  warned !",1381536000,8,468,3.5145631067961167
