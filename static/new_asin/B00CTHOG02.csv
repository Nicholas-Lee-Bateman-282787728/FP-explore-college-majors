5738617,5,B00CTHOG02,This movie was nothing like I expect because it was better. I enjoyed how it was a type of innocent love grow but like in all love stories there is the villain who is trying to split them up. I didn't really like the ending yet I think its the best ending it could have had. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a realistic supernatural love ( ironic).,1377388800,,365,4.154929577464789
5738618,5,B00CTHOG02,"Not really a werewolf movie but the story, told in one long flashback,of a girl who moves to the country and develops a relationship with a feral boy. The story pulls all your strings, making you want to laugh, cry, cheer and reflect.

Take Twilight, remove all but one 'creature', inject a lot of soul, then you get sort of close to this film. The feral boy is not a traditional werewolf, but has what you might call some special features.

I've begun to notice the ability in Korean films to have well timed comedy in the flow of even serious or tragic films (see The Tower). You see that here.

Highly recommended for just about everyone.",1377216000,2,641,4.461538461538462

5738620,5,B00CTHOG02,"After watching this incredible film, I bought the South Korean blu-ray release a couple of months ago that does come with English subtitles. The blu-ray release is OUTSTANDING!!! The film itself is powerful, touching and absolutely wonderful; gotta love South Korean cinema. I also bought the South Korean blu-ray releases for ""Deranged"" and ""Helpless"". Unfortunately for domestic customers, ""A Werewolf Boy"" is only being released here on dvd. THAT TRULY BITES!!! Really! The same was with the domestic release of South Korea's disaster epic ""The Tower"" being released domestically ONLY on dvd. Why Magnolia or Well Go USA didn't grab up these two great films for domestic blu-ray releases is anyone's guess? I am ordering the South Korean blu-ray version for ""The Tower"" as well. There is no point in buying dvd versions when these films are available for import on excellent blu-rays WITH English subtitles. CJ Entertainment dropped the ball on both of these great films.

The film adaptions of the ""Twilight"" book franchise were Hollywood big budget spectacles; what separates those films from ""A Werewolf Boy"" is that viewers were delivered their happy ending.  A vampire husband and wife complete with child.  Where ""A Werewolf Boy"" differs to great effect is in not promising or delivering a happy ending; it's a much more realistic approach to a story of star-crossed lovers.",1436140800,,553,5.191011235955056

5738647,5,B00CTHOG02,"A great movie for all ages to enjoy.. This film has a Shirley Temple flair about it, story book narrative about a older Korean American grandmother child hood. Back home, with a young boy who was rise by wild dog's...",1408320000,,217,4.45
5738648,5,B00CTHOG02,"The movie's title implies that A WEREWOLF BOY is a horror picture about a real werewolf. The film begins in the present day when an elderly woman receives a mysterious phone call to return to Korea. When she arrives, the bulk of the narrative occurs in a flashback of forty-seven years. Suni (Bo-Yeong Park) is now a teenage girl who literally bumps into a feral youth whom she calls Cheol-Su (Joong-ki Song). This wild youth has apparently been raised by wolves, an occurrence that brings to mind Mowgli and Tarzan. In this case, Cheol-Su cannot speak a human language nor does he have any idea about human interaction on any level. His actions reflect a feral world outlook; thus director Sung-Hee Jo suggests that the werewolf motife is merely a play on words. Suni soon takes an interest in Cheol-Su's transformation from his filthy non-human oriented state to one that approximates a normal teen boy. Cheol-Su cannot form human words. His eyes reflect his thoughts. Ever so slowly, Suni's lessons take hold and she senses a growing bond between them. Suni's other family members follow her lead and treat him as a house guest rather than a house pet.

The first half of the film centers on the difficulties Suni and her family encounter with having an undocumented teen boy. A government official suggests that Cheol-Su is a war orphan who was left on his own after 1953. No orphanage is willing to take him in. When a home for the mentally disadvantaged calls to tell Suni that this home can accept him, she already has bonded with him and refuses to let him go. A further complication is a young man Ji-Tae (Yoo Yeon Seok) whose father gave Suni money to buy the house in which they live and he expects Suni to marry him to settle the debt. Ji-Tae is a colossally arrogant jerk who takes an instant dislike to Cheol-Su. When Ji-Tae tries to physically manhandle Suni, the film suddenly veers into an unexpected direction. When Cheol-Su observes Suni in conflict, he transforms into a real hairy, clawed werewolf. Thus the title is now meant to be taken literally. Ji-Tae tries to convince an army officer that Cheol-Su is not human at all but a dangerous animal to be put down. We learn that years earlier a scientist had created a prototype of a ""super soldier,"" one that could combine human intelligence with lupine strength and ferocity. Cheol-Su is clearly the result.

By mid point, the audience has accepted Cheol-Su as human and worthy of having feelings for Suni. She in turn has a strong emotional tie that may be love. The flashback ends badly for Cheol-Su. He is accused of murdering Ji-Tae, which he does in fact do but only in defense of Suni, who then leaves for America. In the present day, a now aged Suni returns to the house where she and Cheol-Su lived. He is there, unchanged over the years. Their meeting is a tearful one, especially now that he has learned human speech and can hear Suni's sorrow over abandoning him nearly a half century ago. A WEREWOLF BOY suggests that the capacity for an enduring and unselfish love is not limited only to humans. For those who are near-human, such love is a given. For those who are human but are mean-spirited like Ji-Tae such love can never be a given.",1407024000,,3222,4.650877192982456
5738649,5,B00CTHOG02,"Werewolf Boy probably missed out on the success it deserved due to its title being assumed as just another werewolf film and even dismissed as oh no not another teen falling in love with a werewolf/vampire story.  But rest assured there's no romance in this one, there is love, but it's the love a girl feels towards her pet dog and the loyalty given in return by that canine, who just happens to be in a human body.  In fact the acting from Joong-ki Song who plays the canine boy is superb and believable as how a feral dog (well wolf in his case) would behave, as well as one being domesticated as the film goes on. Joong-Ki Song obviously studied actual dog behaviour as he behaves just like one. His character was born and raised amongst wolves before the scientist/farmer/property owner has a heart attack (we witness this at the start of the film) resulting in the boy spending an undisclosed amount of time fending for himself on the farm (the other wolves seem to have run off, been killed we're not told).  During the film some speculation is made by authorities that experiments were done on the farm to help win the war but we never really know any more than the single mother and her young family are told which is good because too much information highlights holes in a backstory. The mother and her children move to the farm sometime after the war.

Contains some spoilers - It is the initial unpacking days that Suni (the oldest of the children) is frightened by a dog one night.  With her mother they discover it again the next day only to realise the dog is in fact a feral child, probably in his teens.  The boy can't talk and is very wary of these new inhabitants of his home but is lured closer by gifts of food by the caring mother who wrongfully assumes authorities will want to care for the boy.  Since he's older than the adoptable age the mother is stuck looking after the feral kid while an unmotivated Korean bureaucracy tries to find somewhere to put him.  Suni doesn't want the feral kid who the mother is treating like an unofficial member of the family around, until one day she unpacks a dog training manual and decides to make the situation, especially meal times somewhat bearable.  What follows is a film of attachment and loyalty to a pet and by a pet that we have granted seen countless times before, just not with a human playing the pet.  Throw in your usual villain, this time round it's the spoilt rich kid son of the landlord who makes it quit clear he expects the beautiful Suni to marry him down the track and is used to being given whatever he wants.  When she doesn't tow the line he of course tries to force the issue but a snarling pet wolf/boy won't let the thug and his mates drag her into their car.  Of course from that moment on the goal becomes to frame, kill or do whatever it takes to remove Suni's pet from the situation.

Bo-yeong Park who plays Suni does a great acting job interacting with her wolf/brother pet as well.  There's a lot of recreations of typical dog and their owner or dog not understanding community has turned on it and trying to get it to run movie scenes with the two characters we've seen on numerous occasions over the years which makes the movie a little predictable but still it's a great film.

Language is in Korean with English subtitles.  It is a flashback by an old lady to her childhood film and some of the English words used are quite funny such as the villain is referred to as a slimeball when you wonder if even back in those days they would have used something a bit stronger.",1403827200,,3571,4.41248097412481

5738651,5,B00CTHOG02,"The DVD came fast everything seemed up to par. It seems like it has pretty reliable subtitles too, although I was a little surprised by the cussing. It's nothing outrageous, but I know a little Korean and didn't see the point. It was simple little things like if a person said, in a truer translation, ""What?"" Like the character was surprised it was translated as ""What the hell?"" I don't know if this was done to add emphasis on what the character was supposed to be feeling, or if the translators felt in an American or English movie or whoever watched it, that would be the more likely phrase used. They do this a couple of times and while I I don't think it's anything big, it just surprised me. Otherwise it's a fantastic and there were no problems with the order.",1400803200,,769,4.422535211267606

5738656,4,B00CTHOG02,"The movie itself is beautiful, and heartbreaking, and perfect. I watched it online because an actor from one of my favorite variety shows played the werewolf, and I ended up crying so much. In all actuality, this was an impulse buy, I bought it as soon as I finished watching it on YouTube. So I don't have a problem with the movie.
Two things I didn't like. The price is waaaayyyy to high for this DVD. I could've just downloaded it for free and all it would be missing is the trailers. Also, I asked for two day shipping on a Wednesday, and yet this didn't show up until Tuesday the next week. I'm disappointed with that.",1390176000,,623,4.333333333333333

5738664,5,B00CTHOG02,"A gentle and ultimately sad story of love lost, a young girl tries to humanize a young feral boy who, it was insinuated, was raised as some kind of experiment by the government and locked away for years in a barn as a wild animal. A creature who had never known love, never heard music, never learned to speak. When the girl teaches the boy these things he develops profound love and respect for her and would risk his life for her. The trouble comes from outsiders to the pair in this story, the man who buys the country house for the family but with ill intentions, the government and the scientists and the police, some who are originally willing to help but in the end have to do what they feel they need to do to protect the public. The acting and particularly the music soundtrack are well done. Korean Cinema excels at these accomplishments! Also do not miss the extensive Extras on this DVD, including an alternate ending.

Well, this story was worth it.  It was told very simply.  Once you gave into the premise, the way the wolf imprinted on the girl, the joy he felt in belonging, it was sentimental and satisfying.  MDH was unhappy w/ the way the authorities treated the wolf boy as an animal.  But that was expected, though heart rendering.  The end made perfect sense but if looking for a happy light romance, this isn't that story.  It was a perfect story about loyalty though also beautifully sad.",1382313600,6,657,4.508474576271187

I don't like werewolf tropes (because the media's ruined it for the most part), and I don't usually like romance stories. BUT JFC THIS MOVIE ;A; The acting was phenomenal! Song Joongki's acting was subtle yet effective, utilizing body language more than anything else. He was able to convey so much with no words. I was amazed. Park Boyoung was also great. She was pretty young during this movie, but I thought she pulled off the part well. I actually really enjoyed this whole cast! Anyways, yes, the movie is fantastic. The shipping was pretty decent and the movie arrived in tact without any damage. Super happy!",1478044800,,689,4.75
