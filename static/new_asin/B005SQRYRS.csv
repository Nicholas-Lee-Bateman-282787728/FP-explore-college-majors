4886569,5,B005SQRYRS,"Wow, that took hardly no time at all, just back in April of last year we finally saw this great classic series starting to come out on DVD, and getting them out very fast I might say, over a span of about 9 months we have the complete collection, at very reasonable prices as well, you're getting over 30 episodes on each season for a price of $20.00 a pop, and while the prints aren't remastered or anything, they look and sound pretty damned good considering these prints are probably the originals, and for something that is over 40 years old, that's pretty impressive.

If you bought the first 3 seasons, you know what you're getting with the packaging and everything as it has remained the same, the clear plastic case that holds 5 DVD's inside with the little episode booklet, very nicely presented, and very durable.

Now this season has 'John Wilson' portrayed by the great character actor (Gale Gordon) later of 'The Lucy Show' fame, because the original 'George Wilson' portrayed by the late AND great (Joseph Kearns) passed away during the end of the 3rd season, but I do agree with some of the other reviewers, it would have been nice for them to kind of give some closure on the character of Mr. Wilson, but Gale Gordon steps in and does a great job at portraying George Wilson's brother, quite big shoes to fill in my opinion.

Now I just got this today off Amazon, so I haven't watched the episodes yet, but I remember some of them from when I was a kid back in the late 1980's and early 1990's when Nickelodeon had them on reruns, of course it has been years since I've seen them, but I remember certain things about them, and there are some gems here.

One final note, in this season, Jay North is no longer wearing the suspenders and the slingshot, which is something Dennis Mitchell was always known for, but I guess it was time to change, no big deal there, but people will always remember him wearing said items.

So let's all give a shout out to 'Shout Factory!' no pun intended, for putting this great series to DVD in a very short length of time and very reasonable prices, this show brings back great memories to a lot of people, myself included, so go buy it!",1327536000,4,2185,4.4525
4886570,5,B005SQRYRS,"I am probably the world's biggest fan of Dennis and think I will eventually wear out my discs, but one little complaint only, using ""Gale Gordon"" in season four is NOT as good as seasons 1 thru 3 with Joseph Kearns (deceased) as Mr. Wilson. He just fit the part to a tee and was fantastic. No offense to Mr. Gordon, also (deceased), who also is a wonderful actor, but Joseph Kearns was better in my opinion and they should have left Dennis in his overalls and sling shot not pants and no sling shot are my only complaints. I HIGHLY recommend these collection of wonderful past classics you will love.",1327190400,7,600,4.414414414414415
4886571,5,B005SQRYRS,"Shout Factory should be commended for bringing the entire Dennis the Menace series to DVD. I have all four seasons now. The series with Jay North and company brings us back to a much happier time. If you are looking for some good laughs and some touching moments,it's Dennis The Menace, Season 4!",1327104000,8,296,4.60377358490566
4886572,5,B005SQRYRS,"I have received the final season of ""Dennis The Menace"",and couldn't be happier. I too commend Shout Factory for making all four seasons of this great classic tv series available for all of us to enjoy. If not for Shout Factory,many of these great shows would never be released. For me,""Dennis The Menace"" brings back those days in America of a more innocent time,when the world was not so complicated as it is today. It's just plain fun to watch. Shout Factory has also done a superb job with the quality of this set,the picture quality is really top rate. For anybody who enjoys classic tv shows on dvd,it does not get much better than this.",1326240000,12,643,4.551724137931035
4886573,5,B005SQRYRS,"I just received the fourth and final season of Dennis the Menace.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the first three seasons and I know that I will love this one too.  However, I will miss Joseph Kearns as Mr. George Wilson.  Even though Gale Gordon was a very talented actor and comedian, it just wasn't the same with him in this role, which Joseph Kearns made his own.  Special thanks go to Shout Factory which released all four of these great seasons.  Too many of the bigger DVD companies start to release a series and then abandon it.  Shout Factory followed through on this beloved TV series and released them all.",1326153600,20,612,4.5181818181818185
4886574,4,B005SQRYRS,"It would be great if the final season of DTM would include a reunion with Jay North this time along with Gloria Henry and Jeannie Russell. They did have one in California at a Marriott hotel and I viewed it on YouTube.  I'm not sure who telecast it but it pointed out that Ms. Henry was a ""young 88"" so that had to be this year. The best is hearing Jay North finally coming to peace with himself and the series and how grateful he is for his life.  It's a wonderful feature and I hope this gets included on the final DVD. North did not appear on the first season DVD ""extras"" with Henry and Russell and his absence is never really explained.",1321920000,10,641,4.161290322580645
4886575,5,B005SQRYRS,"I would also like to thank Shout factory for releasing Dennis the Menace series. I have been a big fan of the Dennis the Menace comics and show ever since grade school. The tv show really pin points my childhood to the tee. I wish society could go back to the simpler times again. Thanks again Shout Factory, you have really came through for me.",1321660800,12,345,4.323076923076923
4886576,5,B005SQRYRS,"Here is the final season of this classic series. Would like to thank Shout Factory for releasing this fine series from the past. It will bring lots of laughs and memories to those of us who grew up with Jay North and friends.

4886603,5,B005SQRYRS,"Great cast, excellent writing and so much better than most programs on television today. The first three episodes are also excellent. After the first ""Mr. Wilson's"" death, the second ""Mr. Wilson"" might have been hard to replace....but works very well as the caliber of acting is just as good. So glad we have these shows to enjoy over and over.",1394323200,,344,4.75

4886608,5,B005SQRYRS,"Dennis, was no doubt one of the funniest comedies that was ever produced on TV in the late 50's and early 60's.

4886619,5,B005SQRYRS,"I love to watch this show. Since the death of Joseph Kearns in the 3rd season, Gayle Gordon does a good job of substituting for Mr. Wilson. Even though the plots are different as Dennis grows up, the show is still enjoyable and certainly better than any garbage on tv today.

4886622,5,B005SQRYRS,"I wasn't sure that this season would be as good without Joseph Kearns and with an older Dennis, but it is.  Of all the old shows available on DVD, this series is one of the best.  I had not seen them since I was a kid, so it has been great having such a good show that I haven't seen 1,000 times like The Andy Griffith Show, although I will never get tired of that one no matter how many times I have seen the episodes.",1340064000,5,419,3.86046511627907

8485367,1,B005SQRYRS,"I loved the first 3 seasons but its not the same without good old Mr. Wilson. John Wilson isn't the only problem though, the writing wasn't as good this season in my opinion. Im not sure if it was different people behind the scenes, a change because of Dennis getting older or because they were trying to write the stories to fit with the John Wilson character but whatever it was, the show suffered because of it. This is why I only bought seasons 1-3 on Amazon, after watching season 4 I don't think Ill ever want to watch it again.",1529798400,,534,4.297029702970297
