It is an important video for everyone but specifically for the black youth of today who do not understand the significance of their history and its impact on today. It is a must see!!!!",1142553600,4,328,4.771929824561403

Slavery was an evil that should never have happened and I refuse to blame the victimized for this atrocity.  This is more falsehoods and inaccuracies about the truth of the African Holocaust.",1484697600,,304,5.04

7794297,2,0971051143,"A good mission but poor delivery. I was very, very, very disappointed that this DVD focused on Christianity. The DVD should have mentioned that in its cover. Once a person combines history with mythology and then presents that mythology as historical facts - then it poses a big problem. The DVD lost credibility once that was done. I would file this DVD under Christianity or Religion. If you expect pure history, you will be disappointed, with this product. I would actually like to return my copy or give it away for free. Very disappointed. I gave it two stars because the mission of the documentary, as I understood it, to reveal history from the other side of the story (from Africans themselves) was good, but the execution was very poor, mixing it with Serapis Christos. I would advice the producers to get more historical facts on Serapis before they try and impose that on other people. Peace and blessings.",1359590400,2,917,4.773584905660377
7794298,3,0971051143,The movie in question is very good. I only have 1 problem that I would like to point out. It points toward the christian faith as the model for success. Singling out a particular religion narrows the audience to only those who believe in Jesus Christ's divinity. I would like a film that focuses on historical facts and not mythology.,1297555200,3,334,4.583333333333333
