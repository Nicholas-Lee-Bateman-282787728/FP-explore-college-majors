7914819,5,B00001U0KA,This was a great look at the missionary who started the Nebobongo Hospital in North Eastern Congo. It was very moving to hear her say after all she had been through that she would do it again. The Nebobongo Hospital is still functioning and about to get its first fully trained Congolese doctor surgeon (instead of the nurse surgeons who have been performing the surgeries since Dr. Rosevear left under terrible circumstances).,1301011200,2,427,4.944444444444445
7914820,5,B00001U0KA,"This was a great movie on the missionary lady, Dr. Helen Roseveare!  She was quite a lady and has a great story to tell of her time in the Congo.  This movie was very well done and I have already watched it twice.  I am also reading her book ""Give Me This Mountain"".",1276473600,2,266,3.981132075471698
