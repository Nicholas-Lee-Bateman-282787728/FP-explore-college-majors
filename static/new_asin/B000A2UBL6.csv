2351724,4,B000A2UBL6,"I remember this like it was yesterday. These races were my life back then and while I still ride all the time thing just aren't the same as ""THE GOOD OLD DAYS""!",1294617600,2,160,4.03125
2351725,5,B000A2UBL6,"If you like desert racing, this is the only true desert movie I've seen. It's a little older but those guys on their big desert sleds are cool.",1266278400,2,143,4.142857142857143

8072530,5,B000A2UBL6,"I LOVE IT!!!! I knew and raced Desert against some of these same guys several years later. Some of the footage was used for On Any Sunday, still considered one of the all-time best dirt bike movies. Bruce Brown put together VERY good productions of motorcycle racing and riding back in the 60s. If I could have bought this video when it was new, I would have.",1464998400,,359,4.373134328358209

8072532,3,B000A2UBL6,"Old film footage that is of interest to those of us who rode back then.
Sort of like a friend showing you his old home movies",1443312000,,125,3.8461538461538463
8072533,4,B000A2UBL6,"Fun to watch, but it definitely needed more Buck Smith. They don't call him legendary for nuthin. :)",1431993600,2,100,4.611111111111111
8072534,4,B000A2UBL6,Interesting to hear the directors comments on what it took to get some of the shots.,1422835200,,84,4.3125
8072535,5,B000A2UBL6,Brings back a lot of great memories.,1415923200,,36,4.285714285714286
8072536,5,B000A2UBL6,Great dvd with great old film footage.  I loved seeing the guys lay there 500LBS bikes down in the sand.  These are what real men rode!,1413417600,,135,4.153846153846154
8072537,4,B000A2UBL6,"This is 36 minutes of film re-edited for DVD.  This was originally shot for TV, and now it's making a comeback with dialogue by Mr. Brown himself.  In many ways, I'd rather see the original TV version, but it's great to hear the modern perspective and updates in some cases.  I'm a desert sled lover, so this is a must have for me.  It's no ""On Any Sunday"", but it has a lot of good footage of vintage desert machines and riders in action.",1376611200,,439,4.190476190476191
8072538,4,B000A2UBL6,"If you enjoy watching On Any Sunday, then you should enjoy watching the Hare & Hound Classic. Although this film is not as outstanding as On Any Sunday (what is?), it is a great view into the earlier days of desert racing. What makes this film really stand out is the footage shot from a helicopter using some sort of steady cam device. This footage really gives you some perspective on the number of racers and the expanse of the then open desert. What is truly impressive is how fast the top riders rode with very little suspension travel on those heavy bikes. I watched it twice the first week it arrived at my doorstep.",1358208000,,623,4.426086956521739
