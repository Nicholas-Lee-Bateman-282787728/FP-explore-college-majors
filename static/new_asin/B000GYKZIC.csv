8135322,3,B000GYKZIC,"I could watch Tim Curry read the phone book. So this silly, dated film still worked for me. A contrived plot and lots of big hair and big shoulder pads make this almost a ""period piece"" 20+ years later. But Curry sincetely, and occasionally hilariously,  navigates the hijinks with his usual aplomb. If you like Tim Curry you'll likely enjoy this film.",1385769600,,352,4.67741935483871
8135323,4,B000GYKZIC,"""Blue Money"" was a weekend television project in England; similar to our 80s tv movies of the week. It's silly, the plot is very, well, not very realistic; yet, it tries to be. But, it is definitely . . . fun!

If you're a fan of Tim Curry and you love to hear him sing and goof around; without the benefit of a corset and high heels, you will be delighted. It's just delightful to see Tim Curry play, sing and enjoy himself. One of his only characters without an evil backstory or some sort of sinister agenda. And still, fun!",1272758400,6,527,4.217821782178218
8135324,5,B000GYKZIC,"When I mention one of my all time favorite movies is Blue Money with Tim Curry, 99 percent of people say... He did a movie called Blue Money? They always want to know if he sang in it. Yes he does sing in it and often (I would cheerfully kill for an original soundtrack of this movie.) But his singing wasn't the only highlight, not by a long shot. With lines like ""If he's dead I'll bleedin' kill him!"" you won't get bored between songs.

The plot was fairly straight forward. Larry Gormley(Tim Curry) a cab driver/chauffer, wants to become and entertainer. However until he makes it big, he picks up fairs and the less than honest Ramirez (George Irving). Ramirez leaves his briefcase in the back and Larry decides to peek inside. It is full of money. Like the songs says, Larry decides to 'take the money and run'. Not realizing this puts both the Mob and the police chasing after him. Taking his girlfriend Pam(Debby Bishop) with him he heads off across England and Ireland. They figure out fairly quickly that they are in trouble they resort to disguises to stay ahead of pursuit, but alas now a hitchhiker Des (Billy Connolly) now knows about the money. While in Dublin visiting Larry's Mum the IRA offers Larry asylum if he will turn the money over to them. Choosing instead to buy a.. no wait go watch for yourself. It really is worth it.

This movie was a wonderful vehicle for Tim Curry's talent. His impersonations include a wonderful Mick Jagger, Elvis, Louise Armstrong, Billy Holiday (my favorite) Ray Charles and others. There is also a scene in a bath tub with a sax... sigh.

I never heard of it showing in the States. I don't believe it ever aired here. A shame. I felt very lucky to have caught it while in England. Nearly 14 years later my daughter found a VHS copy and gave it to me for my birthday. I have had to fight off a lot of die hard Curry fans over the years to keep it, and I trust some day they will re-release it. I hope all of you get a chance to see this hard to find movie. Tim Curry is fantastic, clearly demonstrating the natural talent we have all come to expect of him, a plus is that he is supported by a great cast and crew. Full marks to everyone who took part in making this movie. Perhaps someday it will get a chance to shine once more. Enjoy! M.",1172102400,11,2292,4.325581395348837
