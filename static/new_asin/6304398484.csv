860291,4,6304398484,"If you're a fan of independent cinema, at first glance Jane Campion's ""Sweetie"" may feel like a film you've seen many times before - a quirky, deadpan comedy about a dysfunctional family navigating the challenges of love and life with the bulk of the story centering around a free-spirited, rambunctious, and most likely mentally disturbed, lead character who throws the lives of those around her into chaos. As familiar as this premise might sound to the modern viewer, what sets ""Sweetie"" apart from other independent films that deal with similar tropes is the honesty, the tenderness and the unforced charm the film exudes, even during its darkest moments. Although ""Sweetie"" is more than two decades old, it is still one of the freshest films I've seen in months and I applaud Criterion for giving this largely forgotten little gem of a film the attention and respect it deserves.

But is ""Sweetie"" a perfect film? No, absolutely not. As others have pointed out, this is a first film and as such suffers from many of the flaws - for example clunky and disjointed pacing, unnecessary shots and under-developed story material - that you might expect from an inexperienced filmmaker on their first outing in the directors chair. Yet despite some rough edges, it's evident from the (very insightful and entertaining) audio commentary with Jane Campion herself, her DP Sally Bongers and co-writer Gerard Lee, ""Sweetie"" was definitely a highly personal project and a story that the filmmakers and the cast felt passionate about telling with maturity and honesty. Although I might have a problems here or there with certain scenes and certain aspects of the movie, given the talent and energy behind it ""Sweetie"" for me is one of those rare films that manages to be more than the sum of its parts and shine despite its blemishes.

If you're a fan of Jane Campion - in my opinion one of the most criminally under-appreciated filmmakers working today - the Criterion edition of ""Sweetie"" deserves to be in your collection. Also worth checking out on this release are the interviews with Campion about her days in film school and the short video conversation with the two lead female actors in the film (Karen Colston and Genevieve Lemon, who deserves special praise for delivering one of the most powerful and compelling performances ever captured on film). Three of Campion's short films - ""Peel"", ""Passionless Moment"" and ""A Girl's Own Story"" - also appear with the supplemental materials as well and are worth a viewing, if only for the glimpses they offer into themes that Campion would explore later in her career.",1330473600,,2614,4.952164009111617
860292,4,6304398484,"Sweetie (Jane Campion, 1989)/Passionless Moments (Jane Campion, 1983)

Sweetie is the type of comedy I would write if I wrote comedies-- relentlessly black, full of subversive moments, and deeply, deeply twisted. Barrel of monkeys? I scoff at your fun!

Kay (Karen Colston) is rather mousy, introverted, and not terribly happy in her relationship with Louis (Tom Lycos), whom she lands after consulting a fortune-teller. Not the best start to a relationship, one would think (and one would be right). Still, Kay and Louis are content, in their own miserable way, until Sweetie shows up. Sweetie (Genevieve Lemon) is Kay's younger sister, and she's well, I believe the technical term is ""crazy as a loon"". No one but Kay, however, seems capable of seeing this; her parents just see her as slightly eccentric, though still their darling baby daughter. Louis is oddly entranced by her. Gordon (Jon Darling), her manager/boyfriend, is convinced she'll be the one to finally net him some success, and he's not put off by the fringe benefits of managing her, most of which he reaps between the sheets. Loudly. As Sweetie slips farther and farther round the bend, though, the rest of the family does come to see that, perhaps, there might be something wrong; unfortunately, no one's equipped to deal with this new perception, and anything that can go wrong, etc.

I should probably insert some sort of warning about triggering conversations/behaviors, but that's kind of the point of the movie, isn't it? This is supposed to push your buttons (in much the same way that Very Bad Things did a few years later). And it does a very good job of it; the movie was castigated and/or damned with faint praise when it appeared, though it has since been recognized as a classic in the making given some of Campion's later output (e.g., The Piano). Campion, who both wrote and directed, is a twisted genius with a camera here; all you can do is sit back and enjoy the ride. And I highly recommend you do so.

I wouldn't normally review a thirteen-minute film, but Passionless Moments, which can be found in Sweetie's DVD extras, is on Jonathan Rosenbaum's list of the thousand best films ever made, so I should probably give it a paragraph. A short made by Campion in 1983, Passionless Moments takes a number of disparate scenes and puts them together. Each of them is oddly familiar, things you've done or wondered about yourself, but presented from odd angles, or with weird cuts; it's as if Roald Dahl got inside your skull and started writing Tales of the Unexpected straight out of your subconscious. It's absolutely worth your time, and is worth the cost of buying the Sweetie DVD by itself. **** (for both).",1207008000,4,2697,4.8311688311688314
860293,4,6304398484,"Once again, the Criterion Collection's given us a marvelous DVD transfer of a wonderful film that had rather fallen through the cracks -- in this case, Jane Campion's haunting feature debut, SWEETIE.  Odd and intensely personal, the picture's full of striking images (particularly brilliant use of color in the set design), camera angles that are unusual without feeling forced, subversive comic writing, a wonderful soundtrack and, not least, fearless performances from a talented cast.  This is the kind of movie that has such strong interior logic, the audience willingly follows where it leads, no matter how bizarre or unexpected the destination proves to be.  I'd vividly remembered many scenes of SWEETIE since seeing it theatrically in its original release; experiencing Campion's vision again today is just as strong.  The usual superior Criterion touches -- fascinating commentary and student works from this director, insightful essay in the accompanying booklet.  If the only Campion films you know are THE PIANO or PORTRAIT OF A LADY, you may find many surprises here.  Very worthwhile.",1178582400,8,1099,5.39766081871345
860294,5,6304398484,"I've seen three Campion movies. It took a long time for me to forgive 'The Piano''s humorless, heavy hands and move on to 'Holy Smoke!'. But HS revealed a comic sensibility that 'The Piano' never suspected. 'Sweetie,' Campion's first feature, is by far my favorite yet.
'Sweetie' is an odd film. Mostly, it's an examination of what it means to be an individual--inside of and outside of the repetitive struggles of family dramas--and the perils and joys of exclusion and elitism. Campion uses her sharp wit to draw blood, and without the comforts of a privileged moral voice (e.g. the competent parent or maternal sufferer of most family dramas), the humor can seem a little mean-spirited at times. But 'Sweetie' tempers its alienated perspective with moments of grace that are as terrifying, joyful and sublime as the dry open spaces of its Australian landscape.
Moving the viewer through a fractured world of beautiful and unsettling images, Sweetie is this director's most richly creative and psychically adventurous work.",1023926400,12,1025,5.1437125748503
860295,4,6304398484,"This film is to director Jane Campion's The Piano what David Lynch's Eraserhead is to his The Elephant Man - a personal highly stylised experiment before the challenge of the more conventional big budget assignments that would allow for both a controlling of each director's excesses and a streamlining of their obsessions. The parallel between Lynch and Campion can also be extended to their mutual interest in loners, misfits and eccentrics, and they both treat them with piteous dignity, in much the same way photographer Diane Arbus did for her ""freaks"". Sweetie is similar to Eraserhead also because it's an endurance test for those who hold a high opinion of each director's later work. The fine line between pleasure and pain can be felt with great artists and their fine line between genius and crud. Campion here uses a song ""Love will never let you fall"" sung by Tony Backhouse and The Cafe of the Gate of Salvation Choir as a backdrop to her tale of two sisters. Campion dedicates the film to her own sister and the screenplay written by herself and Gerard Lee is based on Campion's idea, so we know this is a personal story. (Campion's sister Anna is now also a director). Campion doesn't introduce the title sister until she has established the nature of the first, Kay, but also we don't fully understand why Kay is the way she is until Sweetie arrives, and is soon followed by their father. Sweetie is a monstrous child/woman but when the arguments between sisters begin it's hard to know whose side to take, since Sweetie makes Kay just as dislikable. Perhaps because Campion knew the narrative could be reduced to the domestic struggle of those tied by blood, she employs an expressionist use of framing where the person on view is placed off centre, as well as stop motion footage of the growth of plants, a montage of the workings of Kay's mind when she attempts meditation, and a flashback to Sweetie as a childhood performer with a growling dog as audience. There are also strangely disturbing images - 2 men dancing together at a cattle station, and Sweetie bathing her father. However, like Lynch, Campion has a wicked sense of humour and the climactic incident in a tree is equally comic, tragic and metaphoric. As the sisters, Karen Colston and Genevieve Lemon are never allowed to become grotesques - they are both given touching breakdown scenes - and Campion appears to have a special gift for handling child actors, with the little boy neighbour and the girl playing Sweetie as a child at the end particularly good. And like Eraserhead, once you manage to adjust yourself to the slow rhythms and lower your too high expectations, you find that Sweetie gets better as it goes along.",997488000,13,2710,4.780383795309168

One of the few movies I could watch over and over for obsessively its amazing poetry and strangeness, set in exotic Australia.  As a young anxious woman it completely mirrored my own sense of fear, loathing, compassion, yearning, awe and confusion about how to regard the world around me.",1459900800,,347,4.688524590163935
7869700,2,6304398484,"This is probably one of the worst movie I've ever seen.
It was made by one of my favourite director Jane Campion. I totally belived her.
But there was not even a single reason to love Sweeite, the main charactor. She was a fat lady who was a unbearable disgusting habit with a worst hateful charactor. Even her father and her sister wanted to get rid of her when they are about to visit their mother.
This movie reminded me of FAT GIRL directed by Catherine Breillat. It was also a story about this girl who is overweight  who's sister is a sexy, pretty girl. She has this really handsome boy and they even have sex in front of the fat sister. The fat girl just watch them having sex and imagine that one day she will do the same. She is not detestable or anything.
She tries to follow everyplace where her sister and the handsome boy go but she didn't do anything wierd or interrupt them.
At the end when there is a car accident happens and all of her family dies and she is the only one survies and this guy comes to the car and rapes her. She was kind of glad to lost her virginity and when the cops come to her and ask whether she was raped, she said she wanted to have sex so it was not a rape. That story was a bit extreme, but my point is, any story should be at least lovable. Even the worst charactor should have some kind of charm to be loved by audience.
In this movie, Sweeite is nothing but a disgusting, hateful, wannabe vomit to her face kind of girl.
When she was naked on the top of the tree, I really wanted to shut down my monitor. The only reason I kept watched it was I bought the  DVD with 13$(Korean money).
Maybe this is a story about Jane Campion's. I don't know. But thinking about the audience, this is just grose, should not have made this movie.",1457136000,,1774,4.139130434782609
7869701,5,6304398484,"Forget the overwrought and overwritten plot reviews on this film.  They're simply not worth the effort or the time.

I grabbed this film out of the Brooklyn Public Library for one reason and one reason only:  a name.  Jane Campion.

The film is unpleasant to watch from the first moment.  But sometimes -- just sometimes -- GREAT films are.

Yes, the film is about dysfunctional family life, a dysfunctional society, a dysfunctional century, a dysfunctional species.  But it consequently suggests the question:  What, then, is ""function?""

Jane Campion will never waste your time.  She may not please your eye and ear, but she won't waste your time.  As a film director, she's simply sui generis.

7869703,4,6304398484,"When it starts off with the eccentric and shy Kay (Karen Colston) falling in love with the handsome Louis (Tom Lycos), Jane Campion's 1988 film SWEETIE promises a romantic comedy. When Kay's mentally ill sister Dawn (Genevieve Lemon) drops in, the film develops in a very different direction. Some element of comedy, very black humour, remains but overall the film is a family tragedy.

The tragedy is that this disturbed young woman nicknamed ""Sweetie"" is simultaneously a victim of her own illness and an unwilling aggressor against her family, who feign love and acceptance but clearly would like to do without her. The strongest aspect of the film is Lemon's performance, one of the best screen portrayals of mental illness since Bergman's IN A GLASS DARKLY. Something I appreciate more on repeat viewing is that the background to this family drama is left ambiguous. That said, I would not list ""Sweetie"" among my favourite films: it is overall well-made and memorable but not quite at the level of effusive praise.

In terms of extras for ""Sweetie"", the commentary audio track is recorded by Campion, script co-author Gerard Lee and director of photography Sally Bongers. The featurette ""Making Sweetie"" is an interview with Genevieve Lemon and Karen Colston where they recount the shooting process, made years later but showing some archival photographs.

The Criterion release of SWEETIE also includes three of Campion's early short films. ""Peel"", winner of the Short Film Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1986, shows how arguments can be sparked on the pretext of the smallest offense, but in fact are only deeper tensions finally exploding to the surface. ""A Girl's Own Story"" is an exploration of teenage girls' budding sexuality (where sex is both intriguing and threatening) in the days of Beatlemania. Unfortunately, the sound is muddy, and for the ending Campion bizarrely segues into a 1980s New Wave musical. ""Passionless Moments"" is, I find, the best of these short films: a series of short vignettes that document the embarassing turns of thought come to ordinary individuals like you or me several times a day (one man wonders if he's been misremembering a sung lyric for years, another realizes with a start that he didn't need to wave back to a neighbour as the latter was only stretching instead of waving hello, etc.). Says the unflappable narrator, ""There are over one billion moments in a neighborhood, and most of them are gone before we realise it."".

As a DVD extra to the short films, there is a 20-minute interview with Campion from 1989 titled ""Jane Campion: The Film School Years"".",1394150400,2,2605,5.009237875288684

7869705,4,6304398484,"First of all, I loved how this film was wholly unapologetic. It feels like the work of someone who's done what they wanted, without compromise. Still, this is not without its merits and problems. While the film stands out as odd and, as such, interesting without knowing more about it, I feel that it could have gained by using more traditional work on the plot, a little like Wim Wenders did on ""Paris, Texas"", or by Gus van Sant's ""Paranoid Park"", which are both odd films where the somewhat straightforward plots worked wonders without taking away from the unusual contents. Having said that, this film is filled with wonderful, everyday, never-before-seen imagery with wonderful human beings, a fresh view of presenting a film, photography where the object of a shot is rarely in the center of the image and a storyline that goes a bit all over the place - thank Bog for that.
