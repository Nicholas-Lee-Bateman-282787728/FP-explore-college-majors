8524385,5,B00839DUEI,"One powerhouse DVD.

I was there at the performance (in fact, I'm on the stage...if you notice a figure with a white sweater behind Eddie Palmieri, behind the curtains, that's me!).

I remember that the show was being recorded and was patiently waiting until the DVD was released (took longer than expected!)

The show was a powerhouse from start to finish.  Eddie's arrangements are always top notch and he always gathers some of the best in salsa in his ensembles.  Probably one of the best live performances I've been to in my life.

The camera work is as close as you're going to get to clear without being HD (at the time, HD wasn't the norm).  It looks pretty darn crystal clear and the sound is excellent.  You hear everyone great and the energy transmitted by the band is just amazing.  From the first number on, they mean business and came to OWN the stage.

If you're a Palmier fan, get this DVD",1448928000,,905,4.4969325153374236

8524392,5,B00839DUEI,"The DVD 90 minute DVD captures a unique live performance filmed in 2006 at the Bushnell Auditorium in Hartford, CT. (The release of this DVD was delayed due to unknown ""technical reasons."") Mr. Palmieri and his Orchestra perform many of his greatest hits on this long anticipated DVD. It also features an intimate interview of Mr. Palmieri with Felipe Luciano, where he shares his life story with poignant reflections, along with his creative inspirations for songwriting. The legendary nine-time Grammy award winner is a groundbreaking composer and arranger, who has carved a signature musical style that is unequivocal in its inventive, and at times, avant-garde approach. As such, he has consistently challenged the boundaries of both Salsa and Latin Jazz.
