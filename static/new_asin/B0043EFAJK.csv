8414760,1,B0043EFAJK,"I really cannot think of a movie I've seen which is worse than this one.  I am a big fan of the original, and although I didn't think this would be a great movie it was way worse than I expected.  One thing you expect from a Cyborg movie is action, but the action in Cyborg 3 is rare and what they do have is just terrible.  You don't even see any hand-to-hand combat until the end and when it finally happens, it looks like an over-dramatized play-fight between kids in the back yard.  The main character, Cash, is a pregnant cyborg whose only purpose, it seems, is to inject estrogen laced drama in what should be an action movie.  All she can do is drop to the ground in pain because the baby drains her energy.  She eventually meets a cyborg programmer, named Evans, who can't fight or operate his own base defenses, but he helps her up when she falls.  The movie starts off with a bigass, dirty truck winding around the mountains for 5 minutes and maintains that level of excitement until it finally ends.  I just wanted to see some good old ass whoopins like in the first movie, but all you get is a lot of bad dialog and a few cheap explosions.  If you watch the whole thing you should earn some kind of medal.  It's horrible.",1302480000,5,1233,4.253218884120171
