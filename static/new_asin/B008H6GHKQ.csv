8527990,3,B008H6GHKQ,"OH THE HORROR! was previously released on DVD as 100 YEARS OF HORROR, which I already have.  Since this was not stated in the item description, I felt the need to make potential buyers aware.  If you don't already have 100 YEARS OF HORROR hosted by Christopher Lee, then I highly recommend this DVD.  Otherwise, this is just 100 YEARS OF HORROR re-packaged under a different title, so don't waste your time if you already have it.",1347580800,12,430,4.558441558441558
