8611022,5,B00B81NR6O,"Robert Mitchum is Dead is a bizarre and at times surreal road trip film that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will be happening next in this impressive wonderfully paced film. The film follows Franky (Pablo Nicomedes) who is a struggling, unemployed actor, who is depressed and addicted to sleeping pills. He wants to make American movies, but he doesn't speak American too well. Yes, American. His manager, Arsne (Olivier Gourmet), is a deranged agent who is hell bent on making his client famous and will do anything, even break the law to obtain this goal, and fully believes in his acting ability.

In an attempt to get Franky out of his rut, Arsne picks him up in a stolen car, and tells him that he's taking him to a film festival in the Arctic Circle. Why this particular film festival you ask? Because Arsne has a meeting with Franky's idol, director Sarrineff (Nils Utsi). Franky, while still seemingly depressed, is at least somewhat excited about the prospect of meeting his hero. The film is the result of what would happen if Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Dupieux (Rubber, Wrong) made a film with several well known genres: a little bit of Film Noir, a healthy does of melodrama, and an avalanche of subversive humor. This is a movie by people that understand and know the craft of filmmaking, which is beautifully shot, full of gorgeous scenery, and quirky characters. It has an unique, albeit weird, style that is all its own. Its a highly entertaining film, that should not be missed.",1371513600,3,1516,4.6992481203007515
