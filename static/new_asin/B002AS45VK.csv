3891078,5,B002AS45VK,"I like that i can save space and watch both movies together.  These movies have nothing to do with original movie (one of my favorites) except in basic thought.  Millionaire giving party for cheating wife with strangers and nothing goes as planned for wife or husband.  This version is scarier, I didn't think I'd like it but watched by accident and got hooked and have now watched several times and am looking forward to adding to my collection.  Recommend for adults only.",1360713600,3,474,4.7439024390243905
3891079,5,B002AS45VK,we have been looking everywhere for this movie and we happened to find it here and 2 for the price of 1 even better would deffinetly order again,1351468800,,144,4.178571428571429
3891080,5,B002AS45VK,This is a great movie to ad to your DVD collection. Thanks to the seller it was a great price and arrived in great condition. thank goodness for the Amazon buying and selling ability. With the Recession one can still add the classics to our collection for the winter months when snow storms wreck the tv... Or too many commercials. Thank You,1345680000,,341,4.516129032258065
3891081,5,B002AS45VK,"I watch both of these films.  And, their vexatious nature kept me upset the entire time.  If you enjoy the horror genre in films, these two movies will ""Fill Your Cup"".  I purchased the films because I remembered the original starring Vincent Price in 1959.  Since I viewed that film as a child, it gave me the creeps as well.  But, modern technological advancement in film making has created a subtle work of art, turgid, with continual images of horrid events.  In my opinion, Actor Jeffrey Combs's character, Dr. Richard Vannacut, and his glowering psycho nurses, epitomized this films content.  To me, they were the examples of nightmarish terror at the highest levels.  These characters were in both films.

Therefore, I always view this movie during the daylight hours.  And, I make sure that my lunch or dinner is deep in my digestional track.  Because a few times, I had to cover my mouth so that I wouldn't vomit.  I'm glad its only a movie and not reality.  Lately, I view the film for desensitizing purposes.  I think I need to view it another ten times and then, maybe, I'll be cured of ""House on Haunted Hill"" and its ""Return"".",1331078400,,1140,4.635
3891082,3,B002AS45VK,"I am happy with my purchase of ""House on Haunted Hill/Return to House on Haunted Hill"". The first movie is a great remake of the original starring Vincent Price, the special effects are great. The second movie was not what I expected, but it was like watching a Sci Fi channel movie. All in all I enjoyed them both.",1328832000,2,315,4.3559322033898304

3891086,4,B002AS45VK,"I thinks ""Return To House On Haunted Hill"", is really dumb. It really is not as good as the first movie. But then most sequel's aren't!!! Has way to much nudity in it and there is NO PLOT what so ever!!! I really like ""House On Haunted Hill"" it's a great Halloween movie really creepy!!",1255910400,,286,4.218181818181818

Despite it's relative young age it does seem a bit dated and cheesy. If you don't take it too seriously, it's an excellent haunted experience.",1418860800,2,263,4.717391304347826

3891170,3,B002AS45VK,"First, I love Geoffrey Rush, I think he's a great actor and the first movie is watchable because him, the two other leads (they have a nice chemistry, not romantic, but friendly(?)), and the caretaker's character.  The story is okay, although I wish they had made better use of the huge building that the asylum was.  The movie went downhill after the attack of the screensaver monster, I wish they had just stuck with the ghosts, which is part of the reason the second is a bit better of a movie.

Thumbs up on the ghosts, but could have been a bit creepier and a few more jump scares.  The first part of the movie is a little slow (until they get to the asylum) and I don't know why they cut some of the extended scenes, the movie is relatively short and I thought they added to the movie.  Andrew Lee Potts did a great job with the script that was given, wish they had expanded that character to give him more screentime.  The two main characters seemed to have little chemistry though, which would have helped make the female lead's actions a little more believable (you got out, but come back for a guy you just met?).

I've seen worse movies and worse remakes (the first).  These could have been better, but at $6.00 for the pair, I felt like I got a good deal.",1398211200,,1267,4.3164556962025316
3891171,3,B002AS45VK,"I loved the first house on haunted hill, not much the second one. But for the price it's a steal. If you like 90s to early 2000s horror, this set is perfect for you.",1396656000,,165,3.8823529411764706
3891172,5,B002AS45VK,I do love the remake of House on Haunted Hill. It's what I would consider a 'fun' horror movie. Not horribly graphic and has more plot to it than a slasher film.,1394150400,,161,4.0625
3891173,5,B002AS45VK,love this movie! Cab watch both movies without having to change DVDs or even getting up to find the 2nd DVD.,1385424000,,108,4.190476190476191
3891174,4,B002AS45VK,"I've always found the first movie intriguing. The 2nd one was equally intriguing, it also explained why the place was Haunted how it became an Evil place.",1382832000,,154,4.7407407407407405
3891175,5,B002AS45VK,"I really loved this movie back in college, and I enjoy it still. I appreciate the little bit of humor, (""I want itsosoyou give it!"") and I find the doctor scenes creepy. Great movie. Usually makes my Halloween season viewing at some point during October each year.",1382659200,2,264,4.638297872340425

3891177,5,B002AS45VK,"As a horror movie fan I love box sets or dual disc sets. these are to good horror movies. in this set i actually think the second one is better. there both good, the 1st one is a remake of a classic, but not a bad remake, not great either. like i said i prefer part to return to house on haunted hill.",1371686400,,301,3.7936507936507935

8360115,1,B002AS45VK,This arrived fast but with that speed it came damaged the holder to keep the discs separated was completely broken. It makes me mad because now I have to locate a replacement disc case to store them individually when I bought them as a set so they wouldn't take up so much space,1523577600,,278,4.264150943396227

8360117,5,B002AS45VK,Who doesnt love the cheesy jumpiness of this movie. Twists and turns and surprises and gore. This will always be one of my favorites. A chilling comedy I say. Came in brand new condition as I'd hoped. Works great.,1516233600,,213,4.487179487179487
