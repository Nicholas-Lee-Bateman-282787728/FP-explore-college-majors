213695,4,630016439X,"Have never memorized a poem, but her brother could.
When Oliver asks for ""more"" our hearts are with him.
Maya Angelou says that they deserve more.
Her autobiographical description of being raped as a young girl and her
recovery is inspiring. I don't think a black class war on all white establishment efforts is right either.
I believe from my own experience that blacks do deserve more.
The black heritage is important to our culture.
It is by the vitality of the parts of our society that we
are served and serve. If you don't allow people fulfill their abilities  their potential
is wasted for all.",1175385600,,601,4.669811320754717
213696,3,630016439X,"This is OK but only tells half of the story. It basically stops right when the book gets interesting. The acting is good, but if you're looking for a video to help your understanding of the book this is not helpful in the least.",1143936000,3,228,4.204545454545454
213697,5,630016439X,"I am truely a fan of the amazing Maya Angelou. As A white man in his late 20's, you may find this bewildering. She has been a light in my life from her very first novel/autobiography. We were not asked to read the book in High School (mid 80's) like many schools, but I took it upon myself to do so. It wasn't assigned to me until college. (The rest of her story, it took upon myself to explore.) I did not know that there was a film of this work until I got married in 1993, when I quoted a bit of peotry of Ms. Angelou at my reception. Someone told us about the film and eventhough there was some creative omitions, the power and strength of the young lady came through. I am greatful for Ms. Angleou and her works. And it was wonderful to see that someone was able to put to screen what was in my imagination.",1017964800,19,812,4.049689440993789
213698,3,630016439X,"I made the mistake of reading the book before watching this movie. I believe I am one of Maya Angelou's biggest fans; however, this movie failed to touch the main ""senses"" of her writing.",1011484800,5,187,4.529411764705882
213699,5,630016439X,"I read this book when I was in high school ages ago and thank goodness I did.  It was one of those tidbits that helps to shape who you are and what you think of yourself.  I was and still am an avid reader but this book was the first book I read told from a young black girl's perspective.  Imagine it....  It blew me away.  But as I read this book it made me realize even more so that people are people.  While your environment certainly dictates what sort of priorities you have when you are young you basically think the same things.  I don't think the times have changed so much that this book wouldn't still be relevant to the youth of today.  For young girls (especially black girls) it deals with self esteem and those raging hormones (commonly referred to as ""I'm in Love""), and for youth of any sex or color it deals with just growing up.
If you have anyone in your life that is young, impressionable and going through their teens this book should be required reading.  They may not want to do it but I don't think they will be sorry they did do it.  You might want to read it or reread it if it's been awhile and then actually take some time to discuss it with a young person.  Maya's style is easy to read and to absorb and still stands the test of time.",1010880000,27,1265,4.14344262295082
213700,5,630016439X,"I was forced to read the book for my education class in college.  i thought at first that it was going to boring but the more i got into it, the more i truely enjoyed seeing a different side to Maya.  i liked the  book so much that i had to go out and rent the movie!  both are wonder  representations of what hard work and determination can do for people!",956448000,13,356,3.9577464788732395

In the age of remakes and movies with II, III and IV in the titles, why this has not been remade or converted to DVD is a mystery.",1401062400,2,276,4.092592592592593
