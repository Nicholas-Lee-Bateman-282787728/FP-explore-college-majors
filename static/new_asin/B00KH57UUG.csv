6426592,5,B00KH57UUG,"A great movie. As i have realised the title was changed from Katherine Of Alexandria. My opinion is,that it should of remained as Katherine of Alexandria. Its an amazing story of an amazing woman that lived in the years of torture and cruelty.
St. Katherine is known for love and healing. Her message touched the world.
A movie that will take you on a roller coster ride of emotions and that will leave you thinking of alot that is going on in reality today.",1408233600,15,458,4.464285714285714
6426593,4,B00KH57UUG,"I was skeptical about buying this movie but was intrigued by Katherine's story and the fact that this was Peter O'Toole's last film. I was not disappointed. Like a lot of people, I know of St. Katherine but really didn't know anything about her. Thanks to this movie, I now feel a little more educated. This is not an epic battle or a religious film as the movie industry portrays, but the story of one woman's beliefs and her amazing life.",1408233600,11,440,4.444444444444445
6426594,4,B00KH57UUG,"This story was about Katherine of Alexandria, she was the intentional lead and those fabulous world class actors were there to help tell story. Blame the distributor for changing the title and the synopsis. This is not a religious story or a battle, but someone's view of the incredible life of an incredible woman. You don't have to be a religious scholar or movie buff to realize that. Excellent film and beautifully told.",1408233600,11,424,4.821917808219178
6426595,1,B00KH57UUG,"Peter O'Toole has a small ""cameo"" part which he could have phoned in.  The filmmakers represent this as an ""EPIC"" when it is far, far from it.  Obviously it was made on the cheapest of budgets with non-actors badly filling 99% of the movie.

6426596,2,B00KH57UUG,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  The story of St. Katherine has so much potential...  However, they didn't seem to have any clear direction or focus for the movie.  It didn't seem to focus on any one story.  It starts with St. Katherine.  Then we're watching a story about a battle front, which wasn't entirely clear.  Then we're back to St. Katherine, who doesn't seems to have much to say or do but write.  Then we're back on a battle field.  In the end, Constantine tells the people to go away, and they start to leave, then in the next frame their all standing around him again to help bury St. Katherine...

6426597,5,B00KH57UUG,"I have been waiting for this film to be released for a long time now. It's finally here and i can truly say, it was worth the wait, what with all the powerful performances and the beautiful poetic
dialogue with exceptional deliveries especially from the legend Peter o Toole. Well worth watching for many reasons. A film unlike any other. I now know what  Saint Katherine was all about.

6426598,5,B00KH57UUG,"The story of Katherine of Alexandria in Decline of Empire depicts a tragic life of a well educated, beautiful young woman whose teachings attracted many followers but ultimately resulted in her death at the hands of the Roman soldiers who followed the orders of the emperor to kill her for her beliefs. The film has a splendid cast of actors, including the late Peter O'Tool, Edward Fox, Steven Berkoff and Sam Beckingsale whose superb acting enhances the portrayal of the movie's characters.  I felt that the debutant actors playing Constantine and Katherine more than rose to their roles' expectations in their quest to deliver a worthy performance. The film contains many beautifully shot scenes, has crispy and clear sound and enchanting background music.  I take my hat off to the director and producers of the film for completing this movie on a relatively small budget and sharing this inspring story with the viewers worldwide. I very much enjoyed watching it.",1408147200,,968,5.04375
6426599,5,B00KH57UUG,"As a film buff and devout Christian, I was very surprised to see how accurate the film was in portraying Saint Katherine. There were a few things missing in her storyline but nevertheless the majority were there. I am very surprised the director was not pressured into giving Katherine a love partner as this is a must in my big budget films and especially with such an all out celebrity cast! Performances were magical to say the least throughout.
I checked out the actress who plays Nicole Keniheart and this is her first feature acting role! Hard to believe as her performance is flawless?!
It was a delight to see Peter lighting up the screen again. Almost brought a tear to my eye.
I was disappointed when I watched the Lionsgate trailer because it seemed like a completely different movie entirely! From experience, I know the Americans like to do this and focus on violence which is silly when you have such a strong story and protaginist.

6426615,5,B00KH57UUG,"Here's an edifying British historical drama on the life of St. Catherine of Alexandria, a 4th century Christian martyr, and the concurrent rise of Emperor Constantine the Great who legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire. Some poetic license fudges the historical details of Constantine's life and family relationships to link him with Catherine, but the movie's depiction of a little-filmed story is consistently fascinating enough to forgive this conceit. Beginning with Constantine campaigning in Britain against fierce barbarians, the film links his rise as emperor to the details of Catherine's life, culminating in the former's defeat of Maxentius at the Milvian bridge (fictionalized almost beyond reality) and the latter's martyrdom (completely faithful to the record) in Egypt.

Highlights include beautiful cinematography, restrained special effects, and solid acting. Despite its small budget, the film looks and sounds better than most direct-to-video or made-for-TV affairs, exuding quality in many aspects. For amusement we get a few lively scenes featuring a fierce group of Scottish(?) barbarian women, widows of native tribesmen killed in battle, who continue the unending campaign against Rome's occupation of Britain. Extra features include a solid making-of documentary that describes filmmaker Michael Redwood's labor of love in making what seems to be a Christian alternative to the dreadful ""Agora"" with Rachel Weisz. All of these elements are to the film's benefit.

The script is unusually literate and a bit slow-moving, belying the DVD's cover art and occasionally weighing things down, but the excellent cast of mostly-British heavyweights -- Edward Fox, Steven Berkoff, Joss Ackland, and Peter O'Toole in his last role -- makes every scene watchable. Unknown actors play Constantine heroically and Catherine stoically, imbuing the former with a passionate drive and the latter with a stoic philosophical mysticism which seem to suit the characters. Catherine's story is handled best here, with the young actress's slow delivery making sense for her character of a 4th century philosopher, even if it may strike some viewers as amateurish. What can I say? It worked for me. Catherine's trial and martyrdom, although hard to follow due to the script's muddled narrative, is the most inspiring sequence of the film and is faithful to the sparse historical record. Viewers won't come away with a very clear idea of why Catherine rose to be among the most popular Christian saints, becoming one of the 14 ""holy helpers"" of the Middle Ages and a subject of Joan of Arc's visions. But her courage and intelligence are admirably depicted.

Finally, I should note that the movie is rated R, presumably for the mildly intense martyrdom scenes, but it probably could have gotten away with a PG-13 rating. There's really very little violence or blood in the film overall, no sex, and no profanity. It's much tamer than the similar battles and martyrdom stuff in the Cristero War epic ""For Greater Glory"" (2012) and other R-rated films that touch on Catholic martyrs.

I've watched a lot of ""saint movies"" and Catholic-themed historical dramas, many of which have been released on DVD in the U.S. by Ignatius Press, and this one is significantly better than average. It's not the best I've seen, as the Italian-language film ""St. Barbara"" on this same time period of early Christian martyrs is more gripping dramatically, for example. But it's far better than most of the RAI international religious co-productions (like ""John XXIII"" with Ed Asner) which tend to feature one well-known film star surrounded by terrible English dubbing of Italian actors and cringe-worthy fictional soap opera touches. This production is a bit slow-moving and incoherent at times, but it's a beautiful movie if you love history or saints, and there's nothing embarrassingly superstitious or scandalous about it. It's also worth watching to see Peter O'Toole on screen one last time, as his classy presence lends a poignant touch to the proceedings. Give it a chance and see if you like it.",1420761600,8,4090,5.307098765432099

Who act well with what they are given.  However,  this is so out of wack that  'constantine'  is now a arab from Egypt!  He was constantius son! In this movie his sister becomes  a Christian martyr and that's not true either.  The roman empire was not in decline in the late 200's early 300's.  it didn't really fatally decline until the 400's and it died fast in that century.  Peter o toole deserved better for his final film for sure.  He was  giant of a actor.  But here is class can't help this film.  Why did they make this film like this?  The movie has war scenes with female warriors and that's not true either.  In fact the wall in England was not a scene of attacks , at least until the empire fell apart.

I can't believe I actually bought this DVD with some kind of hope that, somewhere, in a far-away and yet-to-be-found locality, an Ancient Rome styled film would finally be historically accurate. WRONG!
The film is so bad that you hate everyone in it, including the little girl who grows up to be Katerina the Kristian... and you don't even like her when she's older. She can't act. And in fact, she can't do anything... including saving her butt with a well-spoken argument in favor of her religion. Constantine is a Joke right to the end when he fights a single antagonist under a culvert (evidently a cheap substitute for the Milvian Bridge).

6426639,1,B00KH57UUG,"I was delighted to find this film just before the feast of St. Catherine of Alexandria (Nov 25).  But that was the last delight.  The film seems pasted together.  The tribute to Catherine is real, but her witness was to ""the one God,"" and Jesus Christ, her bridegroom, was barely mentioned.  The end title says that she was ""denounced"" in 1969, but that was a matter of removing her from the crowded sanctoral calendar, hardly a denunciation.  The continuity is poor and the sound is almost unintelligible in spots.  I imagine that the editing was done with an understanding that O'Toole would not be available to reshoot scenes that didn't make sense.

6426646,1,B00KH57UUG,"This film, terribly written, directed and produced by some fool who I hope will never be heard from again, is atrocious. It purports to be the story of Catherine of Alexandria (who never existed) but doesn't even follow the absurdly silly legend. This clown perhaps read a comic book on the subject and then dumbed it down to the level of his own sub par mind. Aside from the fictional lead character, he throws in a few historical characters and gets absolutely everything completely wrong so there is no point going into particulars. It is all horribly written nonsense. It's full of laughably ludicrous delusions such as a group of middle aged (at best), quite overweight barbarian women warriors in Britain who are not only Christians but followers of She who never existed; in whose name they viciously slaughter the Roman legions there. It is sad that this is the last performance (other than a cameo in some other lousy film) by the great Peter O'Toole. It is a testament to his amazing brilliance that even when uttering this gibberish he is riveting and graces this idiocy with a gravitas and elegance which it in no way deserves. The actress who plays Catherine (variously and pointlessly called Catherine, Katerina and Ekaterina, sometimes by the same character) was obviously told by this mentally negligent ""writer/director"" that in order to show this nonexistent female Jesus' sanctity and knowledge of all things she should pretend to be a more than ordinarily brain dead zombie, reacting to everything, including torture, by not reacting at all. This is a shameful embarrassment; where bums like this jerk get money to make such garbage is a mystery. Catherine, before the Church went public about knowing that she was really just a dumb legend, was considered the patron saint of virgins. To phrase it as delicately as possible, this joke would have deflowered her; if, of course, she had ever existed, which she didn't. Based on ""quotes"" supposedly attributed to her used at the film's ending she should have been the patron saint of cheesy, inane platitudes. Amazon really has to start giving people the option of ""no stars"" and ""minus stars"".",1413158400,5,2162,4.9423076923076925
6426647,4,B00KH57UUG,"I have been waiting for this film to be on general release.  I was disappointed that I could only obtain the american dvd version as this is problematic for me being in the UK. I have however, purchased it anyway as I couldn't wait any longer to see it!  I am a big fan of Peter O'Toole and enjoyed his performance.

I thought that the story line on the whole was good, but felt that the characters needed to be developed more to allow the audience to connect with them and make the film flow better. It was a little stilted in places, but I think this may have been a result of having to edit out scenes.  Samanatha Beckinsales' character was powerful and complex but I felt that there wasn't enough time allowed in the film to really appreciate the influence she had, both in the background and on the final outcome of the story, and on Constantine as a character.

I thought the performances of Nicole Keniheart as Katherine and Jack Goddard as Constantine were fantastic, especially as this was their first film.  I would have like to have known more of their early relationship in the film, and seen more of the struggle that Constantine had to track down his childhood friend (or maybe love interest?)

The fight scenes were a little lightweight to be honest, and I would have liked to see a more choreographed and dramatic outcome, but I still enjoyed the performances in spite of this.

I understand this is Michael Redwood's first film and I hope that he has the chance to direct another film and be allowed enough time and budget to fully showcase his talents as a director. I would also like to see more of Nicole Keniheart and Jack Goddard as I feel these two young actors have many more fine performances under their belt!",1413072000,3,1735,4.485714285714286

6426666,1,B00KH57UUG,"So when I write these reviews I try to be as honest as possible. I won't tell you that a movie is good or even so so if it truly stinks. This movie rivals the odors of the strongest skunk.

A description of the movie is something I can't really give a good telling of. The box says it's about Constantine joining the Roman army in the hopes of finding his long lost childhood friend. It talks about his climbing the ladder of success to the point of being crowned emperor only to find his rival has held his friend captive. I gathered none of that in what little I saw of this movie.

I say that because I was so bored while watching it that I began to doze off early on. I would wake, watch a bit more and doze off again. I did see enough for it to irk me that we once again have a costumer who knows how to make clothes for people but apparently thinks that if you are a solider traipsing through the forest and involved in numerous battles your clothes and armor retain that fresh from the rack look to them. Throw a little dirt on those clothes for goodness sake. Make them look lived in! As they appear in this film you have to wonder if they weren't borrowed from another movie that wanted them back the next day in pristine condition. Suspension of belief is one thing but this is going too far. The fact is far too many low budget historic recreations are suffering from this problem.

The worst thing about this movie though is the fact that it is supposed to be the last movie ever made by actor Peter O'Toole. O'Toole was one of the finest actors to grace the screen. He gave so many memorable performances that to single one out would be to do him an injustice. And yet this will be the one that takes the final spot on his resume. That's truly a shame.

As I was saying about honesty, I did not watch this entire film. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I watched the first 30 minutes in about 4 snippets and finally gave up it was so bad. I couldn't find anything that made it worth finishing. More than that I don't feel the least bit of guilt in not doing so. The best thing about this movie was the fact that it didn't battle me when I pushed the stop button bringing it to a grinding halt.

6426669,1,B00KH57UUG,"I've been watching this film for a while and before I begin I should explain something of its troubled history since this really explains why we get the film we're seeing. This film seems to be a work of passion by first-time screenwriter/producer/director Michael Redwood who set out to tell the positive Christian story of Saint Katherine of Alexandria in response to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agora/dp/B003EYVXXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agora</a>'s presentation of the philosopher Hypatia, which presented a rather negative view of the early Christian Roman Empire. The movie was filmed in 2011 using funds raised from private investors through somewhat shifty executive producers who seem to have been dishonest from the start about the returns expected from the film. This dishonest behavior led to a series of financial difficulties after filming was completed, to the point where the film was held in limbo until it repaid its loans. It seemed for years that the film would never be released. Only when Peter O'Toole, whose appearance in the film amounts to little more than a cameo, died did the producers manage to get the finances cleared since they could now bill it as his last starring role. Now the press for the film is filled with touching stories about how O'Toole was desperate to see the film but they only finished the final cut 48 hours too late. No mention of the fact that it took them three years to do it. Calculating quite carefully that O'Toole's name wouldn't help them sell the film to a religious crowd they cynically renamed the film Decline of an Empire, stuck O'Toole's face in the leading role of the cover, and removed all references to Katherine or Christianity in general. From the back cover this is described as the story of Constantine's rise to power as he searches for his missing childhood friend. And now several new accounts have been opened on Amazon propping up immensely positive reviews for the film. The producers are again shamelessly pushing their film in whatever way they feel will earn them the most money.

I can't really hold any of this against the finished film. I don't know how involved the writer/producer/director was involved in these practices and it certainly wouldn't be the first time that higher ups gutted a promising film to make one that better fit their limited conceptions of what a film should be. But either way it's something that prospective buyers should know. A film stands or falls on its success at telling a story. Unfortunately, the film fails there as well. And in many other areas as well.

Plot
The story here is a muddled mess. It jumps back and forth between Britannia and Egypt with little concern for consistent stories in either. Constantine is fighting Amazon women on Hadrian's Wall but he feels dissatisfied and searches for his childhood friend Katherine. Somehow the Britons are tied in with Katherine and worship the same god she does, right down to her symbol of the spiked wheel. Katherine meanwhile never seems to leave Alexandria in Egypt on the opposite side of the empire. The connection is never explained, nor can it be. Katherine is mostly a non-entity in what was originally conceived of as her own film. People talk about her, or more commonly they talk about her writings which are apparently brilliant but are never described or detailed. She's a prisoner in Maxentius' fortress because she's the most amazing person ever, but never do they establish anything she does that makes her amazing. So she wanders (mostly silently) through the hallways as people we don't really know with motives they never explain plot confusing schemes around her. Her story ends unexpectedly about twenty minutes before Constantine's which gives them room for an epic battle. Just kidding. The combined armies of the two emperors of the Roman empire consist of five men.

There are a lot of things that happen for no real reason. This is presumably largely due to botched editing and not the script, but that can't excuse all of it. How for example is Constantine connected to Katherine? This is the most important element in the story and it is basically ignored. Most of the dialogue (particularly in the Alexandrian scenes) are intoned dramatically as if fraught with meaning but they are generally nonsensical. Some samples below:

""She speaks languages. I want to know why.""

""Where were the gods in our last battle?""
""Rome defeated Hannibal's armies with help from the gods.""
""Hannibal was an old man. Seventy by the time we caught him, and that cost how many thousands? Don't quote history. It doesn't fit your mouth.""

Lines such as these are met with thunderous applause or exaggerated emotion. The big speech in which Katherine is meant to defeat the assembled nobles rhetorically is rambling and vague and repeated with no passion or fire. I can sum up the argument as follows: you're wrong because you're a bunch of stupidheads. I've seen more convincing arguments in video blogs dedicated to proving One Direction is the greatest band ever. At least they have passion when they talk.

In short, the script is rambling, unfocused, and vague, relying on cliches and silly dialogue to convey emotions it doesn't understand how to express. This is basically because the film isn't sure what it wants to be. Despite its subject matter it isn't really a religious film since it never outlines any articles of faith apart from a belief in God. What little religious content there is here is neutered to the point of total blandness. It even ends on the utterly colorless dedication ""For those who suffer at the hands of others."" On the other hand Constantine's story is neither an adventure to rescue a lost friend (since he never really looks for her) nor a political drama about his succession and opposition to Maxentius. Things just happen.

History
This film bears no relation to any kind of history. Constantine's career has no resemblance to his actual life. The Constantine here is a young low-ranking officer risen from the ranks serving under Constantius (who is not a relative of any sort), who grew up in or near Alexandria where he developed an intense and inexplicable attachment to a young girl (for no defined reason), who served in a series of disastrous campaigns until he was able to secure peace with the Amazons (seriously wtf?) raiding south of the wall by treating them with respect at which point Constantius declared he wanted him to become emperor (for no defined reason); who then personally assassinated Maxentius when the latter's army failed to appear for battle (for no defined reason), and immediately rushed to Alexandria to find Katherine. The real Constantine was the son of Constantius, who served mainly with Galerius in the east before returning to his father a few months before he died; who grew up in Illyria and the imperial court where his main companions were his future opponents, who fought only briefly in his father's entirely successful British campaigns fought north (not south) of the wall until Constantius died, after which Constantine had himself declared emperor and remained in Britain and Northern Europe for six years until he was able to invade Italy and defeat Maxentius (who was only one of four emperors at the time) after which he stayed in the west securing his empire never venturing east until after he defeated Licinius in 324, 18 years after he became emperor. Clearly he was in a rush to find her. He's not even connected to Katherine in the stories anyway. It's impressive that they managed to tell his story in a way that got not a single fact right.

More surprisingly for a Christian film the presentation of Katherine is completely off as well. It includes none of the elements that were recorded in the Saints' Lives and even changes the most unique aspect of her legend: her martyrdom by beheading after the giant spiked wheel she was due to be killed on broke at her touch. Instead she's turned into a Jesus substitute, right down to the crown of thorns. Theologically, the entire film amounts to nothing deeper than multiple gods are dumb. It has difficulty achieving even this point since it doesn't even ridicule them so much as take for granted that they are ridiculous. You don't even find out Katherine's a monotheist until halfway through the film and the explicitly Christian connection isn't made until the last twenty minutes. When it does become explicitly Christian it verges on being blasphemous since Katherine has been receiving full credit for these teachings with no hint that she might represent a wider religion.

A few other ""minor"" inaccuracies:
The Egyptians were not Arabs and therefore could not be forbidden from positions of influence because of that. Furthermore the Arabs were perfectly capable of rising to high office, and there had even been one on the imperial throne about seventy years before this. Maxentius wasn't in Alexandria but Rome, making the entire East/West divide nonsensical. The battle of the Milvian Bridge involved more than two people and wasn't fought under a little footbridge over a ditch. Two people fighting isn't even a battle.

Acting
Edward Fox is fairly entertaining to watch. He has screen presence, but he simply repeats every line in the script in exactly the same classy monotone. The rest of the cast varies between dreadful and barely passable. Peter O'Toole's performance in a very minor role (he really only has one scene though he's visible in several) is completely unmemorable. It would probably be better if he had been given real lines, but he mostly reacts to lines that make no sense. I can't tell if he's overacting or reacting to a completely different scene that had actual depth. Constantine has no real charisma and seems to just walk through his role. The girl playing Katherine is completely flat and displays no semblance of life or emotion. In fact, she rarely speaks despite this being Katherine's main distinguishing characteristic. The guy playing Maxentius is entertaining in his exaggerated craziness, although he isn't really given any screen time. Everyone here knows they hit a stinker and they don't bother with more than minimal effort.

Cinematography
Mainly this film is a series of close ups with long and unmoving shots. Sometimes the camera lingers on one actor in a conversation for minutes at a time, even as other characters are deep in their monologues. Battlescenes are small-scale and cheap looking. I know this was a low budget production but since the battlescenes were unnecessary to begin with I don't feel bad criticizing them for their flatness and lifeless nature.

Honestly, I went in expecting to see a trainwreck of a movie and that's what I found. But even I was impressed at how badly it all worked out. While it could easily have been a better film with a different edit it is quite obvious from what survives that it was never going to be a good film. It doesn't even have it within itself to be a decent film. It fails utterly as a historical film, a religious film, and a film in general. It is astounding what an absolute wreck this film is. It has to be seen to be believed, and that's as close to a recommendation as I can give.",1408665600,66,11278,4.932596103212217

8658668,1,B00KH57UUG,"The trailer to this film, the publicity about it, the film's title, and the pictures on the video box are all deceptive, as is the toting of this being Peter O'Toole's final film since O'Toole had only a cameo appearance. The film is not about how Constantines success in battle quickly propels him through the ranks [of the Roman army] until he is crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire and not about ""an all-out war between East and West [Rome]."" Nor is the story that is told true. It is a fabricated version of the difficulties that Saint Catherine underwent because she wanted to teach people about Jesus. Although this is so, the video box does not mention her. This is, in short, a fable designed to inspire viewers to turn to Christianity.

The following are some facts about Catherine of Alexandria that are not in the film.  There is nothing that verifies that Catherine ever existed. Most scholars are convinced that the story is not true. According to a tradition, she was a noted scholar around 300 CE who became a Christian around age 14, converted hundreds of people to Christianity, and was martyred for her faith around age 18 by the Emperor Maxentius, who wanted to marry her and killed her when she refused, and died a virgin. Joan of Arc claimed that she counselled her some thousand years after her death.
She became a folk religious figure and many people in the Eastern Church venerated her. In 1969, probably because of the questionable nature of her history, the Catholic Church removed her feast day from the General Roman Calendar. In 2002, because of popular pressure, the feast of 24 or 25 November (depending on local custom) was restored as an optional memorial.

There is a legend that angels carried her corpse to Mount Sinai. In the sixth century, the Emperor Justinian established the Saint Catherine Monastery on Mount Sinai that still exists.",1466640000,,1884,4.773006134969325
