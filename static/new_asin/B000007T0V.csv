7905243,4,B000007T0V,"This Russian black and white adaptation of the tragic-comic story by Gogol, tells of a lowly, sad, shy and introverted clerk who dreams of getting a new overcoat to replace his humiliatingly old and fraying one.  An unexpected raise allows him to finally get a brand new coat tailored for him by a neighbor, and it gives him a sense of meaning and pride.

But, of course, there is grave danger in putting ones entire sense of self an meaning of life into an inanimate object.

Roland Bykov is wonderful as the sad little clerk.  He combines pathos with a sly sense of humor that keeps the sorrowful tale from being merely nihilistic.  There are moments when the performance is a bit broad or theatrical, but they are more than balanced by ones that are effective and heartbreaking.

The film is very nicely shot, with director Batalov bringing a slightly expressionistic and vaguely surreal and dream-like feel to the story, which helps its fable-like elements not feel forced.  Not every moment works, but its an emotional study of a broken soul that lets us take the character and the story seriously by paradoxically not going too far that direction itself.

Frustratingly its basically impossible to find a copy on DVD.",1470528000,,1223,4.79047619047619

7905245,5,B000007T0V,"This short (73 minute) black&white film is a faithful adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's short story Shinel'.  Rolan Bykov is perfect in the role of Akakiy Akakiyevich, a lonely little man who toils as an insignificant clerk.  Akakiy endures ridicule from his neighbors and coworkers, particularly because of his shabby, patched old overcoat.  He dreams of the day when he will be able to afford a splendid new overcoat, which will be custom sewn by his neighbor Petrovich, a drunken but still talented tailor.  To this end, he scrimps and saves, sacrificing the necessities, such as heating, and the pleasures, such as tea.  When he receives an unexpected bonus, he spends his entire fortune on the dream overcoat, with a warm liner and an attachable cape.  And a collar of cat fur which ""looks like sable from a distance!""  Straightway, Akakiy's miserable existence seems to change.  He is invited to a company party ""in honor of"" his new overcoat!  A French lady even pays attention to him on the street!  What matter that she is a prostitute, and only using him to give the police the slip?  To Akakiy, the world now sees him differently: in his fine coat he is a Moscow gentleman.  But, as in many Russian comedies, heartbreaking tragedy awaits around the corner.  The diminutive Akakiy is assaulted by a pair of ruffians and his new overcoat torn from his back!  Akakiy is shattered by its loss. The police will not help him.  He embarks on a frenzied and futile search, and ultimately dies, feverish and delirious, in his tiny room.  Soon afterward, Moscow squares are haunted by an unusual little ghost.  This subtitled film will appeal to those who appreciate Russian literature and enjoy the 19th century setting and costume.",1059004800,8,1730,4.849829351535837
