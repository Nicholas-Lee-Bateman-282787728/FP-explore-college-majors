7827786,5,6302555248,"I don't like every crazy account of life after death experiences. As a matter of fact, I'm very skeptical of the many thousands of NDE's reported.  Not that I don't believe that anyone has every had an NDE experience, but that I think most are hogwash, attempts to make money or to influence their own religion or lack thereof.  But to find one authentic report is like finding a needle in a haystack.  I think Mr. Moody found six.",1497744000,,431,4.430379746835443

7827789,5,6302555248,"Maybe you'll think it's deceit.  Maybe you'll think it's foolishness.  Maybe you'll think it's the most important thing you've come across so far.  Personally, I find these accounts by, more or less, ordinary people amazing.  There's a little bit of schmaltz in the production, but the value lies in the people telling their stories.  I have researched a few of these people and met one of them.  I am completely convinced that these are honest accounts. I recommend this very highly to everyone.",1358294400,,496,4.9156626506024095

7827793,5,6302555248,"I would have to say this movie is one of my top 5 favorites of all time. Great gift for anyone who has lost a loved one or is dealing with a terminal illness.
In his book ""You've GOT to Read This Book"", Jack Canfield listed the book ""Life After Life"" as the one that most changed his life. The movie is as good as the book.
I had been hoping for sometime that Amazon would carry the movie in DVD format but got tired of waiting so this past holiday season I contacted the author through his website and had them burn 10 copies for me to give as gifts. I just played my copy for a friend whose sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She asked me if she could send the copy to her sister because she felt it would comfort her. So I will be ordering more soon.
I NEVER buy movies. Don't like clutter. Just rent and watch them once....But this is one I like to watch at least once a year to remind myself of what is important in life.
One more thing, don't be swayed by the title, this definitely is a FEEL GOOD movie. You will love it and want to share it with all your friends!!!",1232323200,7,1081,4.032558139534884
7827794,5,6302555248,"This video presents the concept of life after death in a logical, no-nonsense way. I never got any feeling that any of this is fictional. When I was done watching it, I felt great peace. One thing I especially like is that it addresses the skeptics' view that these experiences are simply a matter of our brains shutting down. The people in the video are real, their stories are real, and it's all presented in a simple but professional manner. I don't know how someone could not be convinced of this reality after watching this video.",1031356800,8,535,4.583333333333333
7827795,5,6302555248,"I have probably viewed this video 15 or more times. I share it with anyone who is feeling sadness with the idea of death.
It is a documentary style production that interviews many different people regarding their near death experiences. From an assassin during the Vietnam war, to a nurse, to a Soviet dissident; the people are divese, but the stories have common threads. It all comes across as very believable, and very comforting.
An aside: If you are with someone when they die, that's a really good time to sit and meditate. Just close your eyes, allow yourself to get quiet, and feel the person who just left their body. For myself, with my mother, it was one of the most sacred moments of my life.",998092800,18,704,4.551181102362205
