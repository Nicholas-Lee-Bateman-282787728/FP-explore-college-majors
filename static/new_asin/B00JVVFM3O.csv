6395136,4,B00JVVFM3O,"This is a nice addition to the Vampire Anime Genre.
  The story is based in a World where the Vampires and Humans attempt a peace by going to School at the same academy, in order to learn to live together.
  The day class (humans) who enjoy ogling the Incredibly beautiful, Night Class (vampires) are allowed limited interaction in order to prevent accidents.  The school is run by a former Master Vampire Hunter.  The Night class is run by a powerful pureblood. The day class is run by human girl (the principal's adopted daughter) and a Demi-human knight force who try to keep the peace.
  This anime provides a nice glimpse into the Vampire world, and a more dramatic look at some of the realities of the 2 societies trying to live together.
  While I wouldn't put this anime in Trinity Blood's class, its a good anime, with some good action, a strong story, and a nice twist at the end.",1407974400,7,890,4.50625

6395157,3,B00JVVFM3O,"The story takes place in a high school which serves as a school for humans during the day and a school for vampires at night.  Only Yuki and her friend Zero know the truth about the night students and it's their job to keep the day students safe from them.  Yuki must divide her time between her duties to the school, her desire to help her friend Zero defeat his demons, and the vampire she's loved all her life, Kaname.

This story was amazing, romantic and suspenseful.  I couldn't stop watching it.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the ending.  I felt like the end ruined the whole show.  I won't be watching it again.",1461888000,,632,4.443478260869565
6395158,5,B00JVVFM3O,Amazing shipping right on time no damage has all the disk in perfect shape i love this anime series you will love it to. Major plot events. Plot twist. Its worth the watch.,1460246400,,172,4.242424242424242
6395159,4,B00JVVFM3O,"Because few tropes are as overdone as vampire romance.  This one turned out to be a mixed bag, combining brilliance with idiocy.  First warning, this anime has by far the worst, the most overdone, the most grating, annoying, infuriating, crazy, childish, cringeworthy, silly, effeminate headmaster trope I've ever seen.  I get that the creators were trying for an interesting contrast with the fact that he is also the oldest and deadliest vampire hunter who ever lived, but it is teeth gnashingly bad, and unlike most of the rest of the humor in this dark beginning, much darker ending saga, it jars you out of the story every single time.

Of course a headmaster means a school so what we've got here is yet another humans and vampires go to the same school story but with some significant differences.  First of all, one school, two dormitories.  It is headmaster, former vampire hunter Kaien's dream to have vampires and humans learn to live together in peace, thus the inspiration for the school, and pure blood vampire Lord Kaname is supporting it for his own reasons.  Thus, twice each day there is a changing of the guard, but the more important changeover is the morning one, when the Night Class vampires (mostly male) leave the school for their dorm, and the Day Class humans (mostly female) swarm the gate to swoon over them.  The vampires answer to Lord Kaname for their behavior, but the humans answer to no one so the headmaster's two adopted children, Yuki and Zero, have been deputized as a two person Disciplinary Committee to keep order at the changeovers and to patrol the school in order to keep the two classes separate at night while taking a full load of courses in the Day Class.  (When are they supposed to sleep?)  Oh, one more minor detail: the Day Class humans don't know that the Night Class students are vampires and aren't supposed to find out....

Anyone care to guess how well this will work out?  In the beginning this is Yet Another slice of life high school story with the same old, same old plus vampires; if it had continued in this vein, especially with as little action as it has to start, I doubt I'd have been able to finish it.  What makes it watchable, what makes it become more and more interesting as it goes along, was something of a surprise:...

politics.

Not our politics (it is no commentary on current events) but rather the byzantine politics of a well constructed imaginary world.  Humans and vampires make strange bedfellows in any circumstances, but the multiple conspiracies twisting through this story will probably keep you guessing as much as they keep the characters, and at the center of it all, trading pieces with the Vampire Senate, the Vampire Hunters Association, and other assorted conspirators is Lord Kaname, playing the longest, most intricate game of all.  (The creators openly use chess as a metaphor; they might have made the point better by using something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Tri-Dimensional-Chess-Set/dp/B0018S4WM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Tri-Dimensional Chess Set</a>).  I doubt most viewers will be able to call the turns or guess many, if any, of the big reveals before they come.

I was somewhat disappointed by the ending.  Oh, it was certainly clever enough and keeps you guessing about some things right through to the end of the last episode, but at the same time, it felt unfinished, probably because from what I can tell it barely scratches the surface of the saga told in the manga&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Knight/dp/1421575884/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Knight</a>.

Note: Based on my own experience and the experiences reported by other reviewers, VIZ Media has had some very serious issues with packaging problems for this set.  I've personally run into three cracked or broken DVD boxes, not caused by any physical trauma that I could see.  Worse, every case I've ever seen or heard about had a noticeably scratched up first disk.  Luckily, at least in my case the B side of the first double sided DVD still played flawlessly in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONY-SX910-Multi-System-Zone-All-Region-Free-DVD-Blu-Ray-Player-100-240V-50-60Hz-World-Wide-Voltage/dp/B00SHTYRCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONY SX910 Multi System Zone All Region Free DVD Blu-Ray Player - 100~240V 50/60Hz World Wide Voltage</a>, but it is not a good thing, particularly since the problem was totally preventable: it is caused by a design flaw in the multi-disk DVD box or at least an assembly problem: the case was designed for a staggered four disk insert in which the disks are arranged upper, lower, upper, lower, but the insert included is arranged lower, upper, lower, upper.  This means that the first and fourth disks are rubbing up against raised plastic ridges on the inside of the DVD box, which has caused the scratches, and in the case of the first disk that means on the playable B side of the double sided disk.  In this case you will almost certainly want to store your DVD's in something other than the original container.",1458864000,2,5211,5.270858524788392
6395160,5,B00JVVFM3O,Really liked it.,1457654400,,16,4.666666666666667
6395161,1,B00JVVFM3O,so i goten my copy last month and it straches and smears on it then i got a 2nd copy for a replacement and it was worst then the first copy i got screw you viz media don't take of your disc you pricks!!!!!!!!!!,1457568000,,210,3.7954545454545454
6395162,4,B00JVVFM3O,I am very happy with this collection of episodes however my disc one was scratched by disc 3's holder breaking. Would have appreciated better packaging. The discs seem to work fine with the exception of a couple small skips in loading the previews and FBI warning. This is a great show and would recommend it to anyone.,1455667200,2,319,4.614035087719298
6395163,4,B00JVVFM3O,I like this series and found myself ordering it on Netflix so often that I decided to buy it.  I like the tension within the plot and the charades are well developed.,1454630400,,166,4.1875
6395164,4,B00JVVFM3O,I can say this series is better than Twilight in fact it blows Twilight's plot away.  The story is about a girl in school on a disciplinary committee and also this school has vampires living with humans in separate facilities at different times of the day and there's a lot of other details but they'd be way to long.  Anyway can check it out for anime fans.,1454025600,,358,4.3283582089552235
6395165,2,B00JVVFM3O,I am very disappointed with the packaging.  The dvd case was cracked in several places.  The dvd set itself is unimpressive - there was no package insert with a product description and the dvds themselves were blank!,1453852800,,216,4.8108108108108105
6395166,5,B00JVVFM3O,"This is a great adaption of the titular manga, and I felt like the art, music, and character personalities were spot on. I just wish they adapted more of the story.

6395174,1,B00JVVFM3O,"Different strokes for different folks. This is not what I was expecting. It is a romance story, and so some people might really like it. However, I suppose I was thinking it was going to be akin to Hellsing or Blood +. So, I would recommend anyone seriously considering buying this to do some research. The art was not the worst I have seen and the voice actors did not bother me, so it did have that going for it. I think there may have been a few discrepancies in the subtitles.",1430697600,5,480,4.228260869565218

6395176,5,B00JVVFM3O,This is a really good anime for anyone that likes drama or goory stuff this is the one there is a lot of blood sucking and they like to say bastard but you can't just watch one show you have to watch all of them to understand what is going on.,1427587200,,243,3.784313725490196

8654099,5,B00JVVFM3O,"Everyone that has commented on the packaging/scratches/marks is SPOT ON; do not take it lightly.
The DVD's are literally shipped in a plastic sleeve without bubble wrap or any type of protection whatsoever. So expect damage.
I see some marks on 1 DVD, my case is broken and cracked in several places, and the plastic wrap to seal the case was torn. Unfortunately, I don't have time to actually watch the collection right now to see if there are major skips...so I'm really bummed.
My 5 stars is for the actual Series of Vampire Knight and has nothing to do with the seller. I received my product in a very timely manner; but anyone that has any kind of sense knows that how the product was shipped is NOT acceptable.

- end rant -

Now all that being said, I'm someone who CANNOT stand manga/anime. I even tried reading the stuff once and just couldn't get into it. I had a coworker who watched this type of stuff all the time and she suggested this series...somehow I forced myself to try it out and I think the only reason why I got through this was because there was a dub version (which I happen to like very much). I eventually totally fell in love with the story and finished both series 1 & 2. Loved it so much I bought the collection.
Likable characters; however, Yuki can be very annoying at times.
