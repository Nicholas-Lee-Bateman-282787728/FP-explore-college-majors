8652450,5,B00JMID1F2,I enjoyed this one. There were some beautiful ocean views with streets winding through town. I felt like I was there again!,1438905600,,123,4.636363636363637
8652451,5,B00JMID1F2,"If you're like me you LOVE ocean views and I just adore these Bike-O-Vision videos for that!  They take you straight to the heart of all the best places and keep you moving through them at a good brisk pace.  I cant get enough of them!
  Some other so-called cycling video I tried had me dawdling along for half an hour just trying to make it up one hill and there were no side views or anything to look at- how boring is that?  And why would anyone want to set the tension on their workout so high for so long?  Thats not a good cardio workout, thats trying to make your legs look like a frogs:-)!  Not Bike-O-Vision:  no loafing and loitering here.  Life is short so why not experience the best of it all while working out?  Their philosophy makes sense to me, too- and like good nutrition, quality vitamins, and daily calisthenics, they just work and so have easily become a permanent a part of my health regimen.
  So in short, this Carmel to Monterey video is awesome!",1412035200,,973,4.314917127071824
