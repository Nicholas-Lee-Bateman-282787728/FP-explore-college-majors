8272079,5,B001960LGM,"Japanese DVD release of Dragon Ball The Movies #1: Dragon Ball Z contains the entire movie presented in 16:9 cropped in similar fashion to the Funimation releases on steelbook and DBZ Movie Collection Set 1. This movie is also known as Dragon Ball Z The Movie 1: Dead Zone.
However, in this DVD release the video quality is very good and detailed as if it's truly remastered Dragon Box style and the original Japanese audio sounds even better in Stereo than I first thought! No offense to Funimation and Manga Entertainment, but this is what you call Digitally Remastered that truly lives up to its name.

In the Dragon Ball Z timeline, the first movie apparently takes place 5 years after the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament and right before the events of Season 1 (Vegeta/Saiyan Saga). The featured villain for this movie is Garlic Jr., whose obsessed with immortality. Can Goku and the Z-Warriors stop him? Only one way to find out.

After the movie, there's special extras such as TV commercials of the first 4 DBZ movies of the Dragon Ball The Movies DVD series, movie prologues, and more DVD trailers.

If Funimation were to re-release the Japanese Dragon Box The Movies on Region 1 today with English subs, then they would be labelled as Collector's Editions based on these Japanese releases!",1467244800,,1302,4.803571428571429
