8311520,2,B001IXXYCO,Not the best. Seems like it was done by teenagers. Could use a lot more suspense and less blood. AND a little shorter running time would have been good.,1245110400,,152,4.275862068965517
8311521,4,B001IXXYCO,"at first, i thought da movie was a gonna b a comedy instead of a horror. I was wrong, it was actually a action packed horror film, that actually excited me with an intense feeling through my body. I enjoyed NITE TALES.",1238371200,,218,4.214285714285714
8311522,4,B001IXXYCO,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. There is something like two movies in one.

2. In the first, there are some thug bank robbers that rob a bank and then drive a car that breaks down while headed back to the city. There they meet some cannibals (but they don't know that) that they plan to rob. They try to get ready to rob them, but the cannibals have a surprise for them.

3. In the second part, there are some college kids sitting around at a party and the ""Blood Mary"" legend comes up. The students say ""Bloody Mary"" into a mirror several times and then a clown knocks at their door. The clown is a really weird acting guy, and eventually a cop (who may be an impostor) comes along. One of the college kids has her throat slit and the whole scene becomes a Whodunit. While they are trying to figure it out, progressively more of the students get their throats slit until finally it turns out that it was neither the cop nor the clown but that Bloody Mary really *did* make an appearance and do the dirt.

First comment: Flavor Flav looked like a fool in this movie, and didn't add much of anything to it. It's a good thing that his part was short, or the whole movie might have collapsed.

Additional comments:

1. This movie was great for what it was (a low budget picture). One can really see that the director carefully thought out every scene. And the plot was not quite original, but neither was it hackneyed.

2. This is worth a matinee movie ticket just to see it.

3. Some elements of the movie were a bit unbelievable--- but then, it was a horror movie, so it is likely that those parts had to go with the film to make the whole thing work.

Overall, it was an interesting watch.",1234051200,3,1691,4.275862068965517
