5682048,3,B00BY8DKZO,"I really love Betty Grable but this film is not exactly up to par with most of her other films.
The one thing that really bothered me was the casting of Danny Thomas. Like a previous reviewer, I find him to be obnoxious and his scenes overly long. If the DVD had chapters, I'd have to skip over his scenes.

Dan Daily was not one of my favorite of Betty's leading men BUT at least he could dance and be her equal on the dance floor. Most of Betty's other dancing partners were either uncredited people (like choreographer Hermes Pan), ballroom dancers (like Cesar Romero) or men that gamely moved through a routine (like John Payne and Victor Mature). Dan Daily at least hoofed a good routine and had some charm in the process.

Like all films in the Fox Cinema Archives series, there are no chapters, no trailers, no extras of any kind - just the film.

I'm just happy to finally see this and other films in this series finally released on DVD. There are a lot of bootlegs of these movies out there; this is the real DVD. This film was never released on VHS.",1367971200,6,1059,4.338383838383838
5682049,2,B00BY8DKZO,"Not one of Grable's best. Dan Dailey and Danny Thomas can get a little obnoxious. Forgettable songs, but a few good tap dance numbers. A kind of silly story with a ridiculous ending. I found it unfunny and tuneless. Grable is still beautiful, but has had a lot better musicals.",1367625600,,277,4.56
5682050,3,B00BY8DKZO,"Pleasant if mild musical comedy loosely, very loosely based on Harold Rome's stage revue CALL ME MISTER.  The film which is set in post WW2 Japan has a better than average plot for a musical.  Only two songs remain from the original show: CALL ME MISTER and GOIN HOME TRAIN performed by Bobby Short in his only film appearance.  But the main reason for watching the film is the re-teaming of Grable & Dailey.  They work so well together. To me the best original song in the film is I'M GONNA LOVE THAT GUY sung by Grable and chorus.  Busby Berkeley staged the musical numbers as well as the finale and this is far from his best work. Danny Thomas has a couple of funny routines. The Technicolor print looks fine for a FOX MOD. Grable was coming to the end of her long reign as queen of the FOX lot and her musicals of the early 50's were never as good as her 40s films, although one never tires of her performances. Her next film with Dailey MY BLUE HEAVEN released circa 1952 would be their last teaming and Grable had one last hurrah in HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE. To me she stole the picture from both Monroe and Bacall.",1367193600,7,1123,4.278301886792453
5682051,4,B00BY8DKZO,"HAPPY with peppy Betty Grable musical, HAPPY with the print quality.

CALL ME MISTER takes place in Japan just after World War 2.  Betty is touring military bases in a USO-type show (called CATS) with sidekick Benay Venuta when she runs into soldier and ex-hubby Dan Dailey.  Grable has two outstanding musical numbers:  She begins ""Japanese Girl Like American Boy"" in a colorful kimono, then segues to navy whites with the Dunhill trio in a terrific tap dance routine.  The second is the finger-snapping ""I'm Gonna Love That Man Like He's Never Been Loved Before.""  What's puzzling is that she and Dailey perform only one number together, ""I Just Can't Do Enough for You, Baby,"" an interpretive style dance that was popular in the early 1950s.  Good supporting cast features Danny Thomas, Dale Robertson, Frank Fontaine.  Plus an uncredited Bobby Short practically steals the show singing ""Goin' Home Train.""  Busby Berkeley is past his prime as he stages the musical numbers, including a finale with a beautiful fountain that isn't on screen long enough.  Not as colorful as a typical Grable musical---her CATS uniform is dull gray, Dailey wears army khaki, the chorus soldiers sport olive drab, and Betty and Dan are costumed in dark blue for their one number.

Never-the-less, I was very satisfied with the MOD transfer from Fox Cinema Archives.  Maybe this one doesn't measure up to their other three musicals together, but Grable and Dailey fans won't be disappointed.",1367020800,10,1474,5.020576131687243
8575458,2,B00BY8DKZO,"I bought this for BOBBY SHORT ONLY.
I do enjoy Betty Grable and Dan Daily but WHY not use Harold Rome's score? The score is forgettable EXCEPT FOR  BOBBY SHORT AND ""THIS TRAIN"" from the ORIGINAL BROADWAY SHOW.
PLEASE CHECK OUT THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST CD.
I'm not sure if it's still available but  the CD I have has ""THIS IS THE ARMY"", ""CALL ME MISTER "" AND ""WINGED VICTORY"". THIS IS A THRILLING COMPILATION of WW2 SHOWS. I HOPE AMAZON IS STILL SELLING THIS!
ENJOY THE FILM FOR ESCAPISM AND BEAUTIFUL BETTY AND DAN.
I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE FILM.
WATCH FOR BOBBY SHORT!",1528329600,,567,4.390476190476191
8575459,5,B00BY8DKZO,Betty Grable was the best  of her era.  With all the big musicals that have been coming out over the last few years it made me nostalgic for the old stuff.  I was so happy to be able to order this and others from Amazon.,1521849600,,220,3.8444444444444446

8575461,5,B00BY8DKZO,"This is an unexcepted fun movie. The scene where Betty Grable dances with the sailors is a wonderful surprise, her tap dancing skills were fantastic . Never realized she tap danced.
Watching Danny Thomas do a bit of his club act was great filled with lots of laughs.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1461196800,2,299,4.660377358490566
8575462,5,B00BY8DKZO,"My wife really enjoyed watching this film years ago, and she wasn't able to find it. I found it on Amazon, and gave it to her for Christmas. Score!

We both really enjoyed it. The acting and musical performances are great. We especially enjoyed the military satire (both of us served), and even though it's in a different era, the comedy is still very relevant.

I would recommend it to those who want a good laugh and some family-friendly entertainment.",1422144000,3,454,4.6625

8575467,4,B00BY8DKZO,"Last of the four Betty Grable-Dan Dailey movies has them performing I Can't Do Enough for You Baby, regarded as the pinnacle of their screening dancing.  Betty delivers, as always, especially in her solo musical numbers.  But the movie itself can drag when she is not around.",1368748800,3,275,4.829787234042553
