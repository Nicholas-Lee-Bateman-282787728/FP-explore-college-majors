7485726,1,B0170K36TY,Terrible quality. Not the movie that I was expecting it to be. Didn't watch anymore than 10 minutes of it total. Would like my money back on this one.,1449100800,,150,4.206896551724138

7485732,1,B0170K36TY,"This movie is awful and has nothing to do with the story of Krampus. With Krampus coming to theaters soon,(Dec/2015) there are going to be B movie knockoffs using the name to get people to watch I suppose. This crappy movie has lame actors' and a lame plot. The Krampus character is all CGI and looks like a 3D cartoon.  It's like something you'd see on SyFy (special effects wise).
Lucky for me I didn't have to pay for this trash, and hopefully you won't either. If you want to watch a movie about Krampus that is decent, try A Christmas Horror Story.",1446595200,15,553,4.368932038834951
7485733,2,B0170K36TY,"Robert Conway's story is a twisted and haunting tale that focuses on an evil little girl with the ability to summon Krampus. However the concept and the finished product don't really connect. Alone the evil kid with voodoo dolls is a creepy horror, and the holiday is well represented in ""Krampus: The Reckoning"", but unfortunately Krampus was missing. It is as if the idea to add Santa's dark sidekick was an afterthought.

The cast offer us a mixed bag of disconnected deliveries of action film rhetoric, and attitude, with the occasional moments of really connecting with the character and bringing some authenticity to the scenes. Sometimes the acting is over-the-top, or over-expressed, the detective guy was likable, but  really seemed to be channeling his best Seagal or Statham. Mostly the film is just really dull, slightly pointless, and all though Krampus is in the title, the writer and director seemed to be more focused on an evil little devil child who needs a painful time-out, than the more sinister Christmas demon of retribution.

The special effects are slightly Syfy-ish. Although to be honest I have seen better quality in Syfy films concerning CGI. Again practical effects seemed greatly overlooked, and opportunity to exploit more blood soaking, carnage becomes small, meaningless episodes of computer-generated crispies. Again I think Krampus was an afterthought and ""Krampus: The Reckoning"" is more about a hateful girl out for vengeance as she plays with voodoo dolls and throws her tantrums. Overall, and I hate saying it because I love Christmas horror and I love all things Krampus, but ""Krampus: The Reckoning"" is one film that I found irritatingly disappointing.",1445731200,9,1694,5.197802197802198
7485734,5,B0170K36TY,The movie itself is good. I enjoyed it even though it's not actually about true Krampus folklore that been around since like forever . More like an Unleashed demon to take revenge  But not a bad movie at all.,1494374400,,208,4.333333333333333

The camera quality was good and did a good job at capturing scenes. MAYBE it was my speakers but the audio was such poor quality I thought my speakers broke.
The acting is what you would expect from a B movie cast, the worst offender was the Detective who talked in a low mumble voice as if he had peanut butter in his mouth the entire movie almost. The best actor was the Doctor, who was in a league of his own.

Starting off with a grandmother telling a young girl a story about Krampus, their acting was as if they were card board characters. The only good acting wasn't Rachel the psychologist and the girl who summons Krampus. Those two were convincing and impressive. Wish I could say the same for the story line.

Basically a young girl in foster care has the ability to summon Lrampus to kill people who are bad. Her first victims are her foster parents. Krampus in the movie kills by burning his victims to a crisp. She is not a suspect as she was locked in a room. Next goes a nurse and a few others who have sins. The psychology major gets involved and gets really interested in the case. She has a burn scar on her wrist which she forgets how it got there. Without any segue we find she is connected with the girl who calls Ltampis and never ages.

The Krampus figure just stands there. According to mythology he does not burn people and he does not hunt adults. He beats bad kids with a birch stick. Not recommended.",1473984000,,1283,4.3153526970954355

7485911,4,B0170K36TY,"*As part of the recent holiday festivities, The Crowgrrl found Krampus: The Reckoning (Uncorkd Entertainment) on Redbox. Not to be confused with the theatrical release Krampus (which is supposed to be a dark comedy, although Ive not seen it yet), this one is pure horror  horror featuring a truly creepy kid! (Is it me or are those some of the most disturbing films out there?!)

The official synopsis is: Zoe is a strange little girl with a not-so-imaginary friend, Krampus, who is the dark companion of kindly Old St. Nicholas. Krampus has been unleashed on a small town, and the legendary demon will seek out all the naughty people to punish them at Christmastime. No one is safe as Krampus hunts them down, tortures them, then drags their helpless souls to the depths of Hell.

The story opens with Zoes grandmother reading the legend of Krampus to her. We also have several flashback scenes where Zoe and her sister are reading from their grandmothers book when they're not supposed to be doing so.

We segue to a counseler, Dr. Rachel Stewart (Monica Engesser), trying to get through to Zoe (Amelia Haberman) after her foster parents are brutally murdered. Zoe, however, is a tough nut to crack, and is not opening up to the questioning. She does, however, plead that Dr. Stewart retrieve her most precious possession for her. This turns out to be a rather ugly doll depicting the demon Krampus.

The body count continues to rise with circumstances similar to the deaths of her foster parents, and only Zoe has the key to know whats going on. Its also interesting to note that Zoe has a connection to the people who end up dead.  Detective Miles OConnor (James Ray) is pressuring Dr. Stewart to find the missing key to the puzzle.

Zoe has the power to unleash the Krampus who punishes bad people and does. Rachel Stewart (Monica Engesser) is a child psychologist who becomes fascinated with Zoe. Rachel was memory flashbacks in bad dreams about the Krampus.

7485922,2,B0170K36TY,"This movie follows a wicked little girl named Zoe Weaver.  Zoe has a sewing kit from which she makes a sort of Voodoo doll of her victims intended for the Krampus to kill.  She also has this Krampus doll that kills people that are deemed bad by the Krampus.  Once Zoe removes the little chain that she has attached to her Krampus doll it unleashes a fiery touch to its victims.  Zoe has been through foster family to foster family unleashing the Krampus on anyone that messes with her.  As the cops found her in the house of her abusive foster mother, they take her to some part of the hospital where other children are, including burn victims.  A beautiful child therapist named Dr. Rachel Stewart (of whom works with an alcoholic cop named Det. Miles O'Connor) is put on the case involving Zoe.  She visits Zoe to ask her questions about her foster families from past to present and also about the murders.  Zoe (who's barely interested in talking to Rachel) tells her about the Krampus and what he does leaving Rachel puzzled about what to believe.  Rachel is a single parent who takes care of her son Lamaar.  While there's business between her and Det. O'Connor, there's also some sexual tension between them too.  The biggest question here is not just what is Zoe mainly after?, but also, Is Zoe what she seems?

This movie had potential, but it boasts uneven character development, the actors doing an okay job at one point and then not seeming to put any feeling into their lines to the point of seemingly reading off the teleprompter the next.  Zoe not only comes off like a cheap rip-off of Delia from Omen IV, but she's just a super lame one-dimensional character.  Rachel's son Lamaar  was just a filler character that the movie didn't even need.  The special effects for the Krampus were okay but I didn't care for the look that they gave to the Krampus.  I prefer the look of him that I normally see where including, long claws, practical fangs, a closable mouth, a creepy glow in its eyes, and brown or white fur.  The look they used here just looks like a typical demon stereotype showing no classic Krampus feel.  The kill scenes were all the same featuring the Krampus burning his victims to ashes.  All this movie has is good scenes of nudity.  The ending is just a downer that's not well explained, to say nothing of the movie truly falling apart within the (mostly rushed) final 13 minutes.

In closing, as much as I'm into the character the Krampus, I had very high hopes for this movie that were shattered quickly with its inadequacies and poor storytelling and characterization.  It's particularly annoying that they show this grandmother telling her granddaughter this story.  Who are those people anyway?  Why don't they show them at the end?  As this movie presented some excellent nudity, it's not enough to save it.  It's always a bummer when a Christmas horror movie is no good since their what I'm into, but this movie  just proved lackluster to say the least.",1449360000,4,2991,4.624288425047438

At least it had a script and fleeting frames that almost appeared to be from a real movie. Sunny California is probably not the best setting for a Christmas horror flick, but hey, I'm not a filmmaker, just the poor slob who subjects himself to their worst efforts.",1514592000,,399,4.633802816901408

8737731,1,B0170K36TY,"This is a porno-flick and not a movie.  Plenty of bare-chested women, bare bottoms and even hair on naughty bits...is supposed to compensate for horrifically BAD acting, BAD script, CORN OFF THE COB movie. A PURE LOSER and if you even spend a dollar on this you got ripped off.  You been warned.",1512345600,,295,4.547169811320755
8737732,3,B0170K36TY,"This was my introduction to Krampus.  Casting felt spot-on, script was tight - dark comedy at times.
I enjoyed this film and while I wanted the ending to end, I didn't want the film itself to.  (Know what
I mean, Vern?)

Not for young kids.  They are already scared of Santa's lap...",1511308800,,283,4.384615384615385
