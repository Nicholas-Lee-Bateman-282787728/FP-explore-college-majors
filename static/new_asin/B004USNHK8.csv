8442151,5,B004USNHK8,"Very good videography. Good merging of the info in the previous 2 DVDs (Demo Winter & Demo Bomb) with important and significant updates. Thoughtfully done, logically laid out, good factual analysis, good presentation of data. Not emotionally driven, yet presented in such a way that the facts come alive. Further, the content and conclusions are supported with readily verifiable facts. Extremely thought provoking. Examines aspects of our culture we tend to overlook completely, yet have enormously significant impacts. As another reviewer said, ""It is not political but it explains the political environment we are in. It is not religious but it explains why religion is relevant to what is happening today."" This presentation has added to my Worldview considerably. Something every person should see, especially high schoolers, college age folks and those who make decisions impacting our culture, such as elected officials and government workers at all levels. I would consider this a 'must see'.",1396137600,4,1000,5.458064516129032
8442152,5,B004USNHK8,This documentary is basicly a combination of the two previous films Demographic Winter and Demographic Bomb.  Still well worth the time and money in my opinion.  The information contained in this film will help you better understand the forces behind our economy.  If you have young children this is must have information for their economic futures.,1347321600,5,349,5.196428571428571
