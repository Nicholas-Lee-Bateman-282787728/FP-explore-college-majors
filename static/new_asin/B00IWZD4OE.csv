Star Paulette is sleeping with Clcio until his brother in law turns up. This is 18 year old soldier Fininho  the two hit it off immediately.

Meanwhile back at the barracks all is not as it seems with Fininho being bullied for not liking the ladies. There are also the side stories of the families and the ordinary ups and downs that add to highlight how much fun the theatre is  this is called The Star Spangled Floor and they describe it as the Studio 54 of the Favella! They also have a very inventive bent for making costumes  scanty  and props  check out the helmet made from a colander.

This is a very vibrant film with some good period detail and a lovely soundtrack with some notable performances too. It is not a mammoth sex fest but it does have some well realised bedroom scenes. It is also a film that will put a smile on your face and considering some of the subject matter here that is quite an achievement. This is one I rented but now intend to buy as its one I know I will get more out of on subsequent viewings.",1449273600,,1307,4.349794238683128

FILM FACT Part Two: UP is the third Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino, after The Incredibles and Ratatouille. What Pete Docter wanted more importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Michael Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the animation film, when young Carl is in the film theatre watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is ""Muntz's Theme,"" which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70 years later. ""Ellie's Theme"" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Michael Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that changes during a particular moment in the story. A technical director worked out that in order to make Carl's house fly, he would require 23 million balloons, but Pete Docter realised that number made the balloons look like small dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927 balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622 balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: PIXARs UP 3D is another of the PIXAR Animation Studios marvels of humour, hope, and heart. Combining an exciting adventure tale with a more humanistic story of love lost and life reaffirmed. UP 3D brings the celebrated animation studio another triumphant entry in their string of Oscar-winning innovative computer animated adventures. Appealing characters of all ages and kinds and an engrossing tale set in a fantastic other-worldly region of the Earth give UP its unique hold on ones imagination, and the addition of 3D in this latest release only increases the impact of these adventures. Despite some obvious fantasy elements, there will be moments during the film where you're likely to forget you're even watching animation. The characters and their situations become real, and the story becomes so enthralling that its form fades in your memory. Its the hallmark of magnificent filmmaking to say that this is a great movie, not just a great animated movie.

Newly widowed Carl Fredericksen [Ed Asner] is deemed a public menace after attacking a building contractor whos trying to get him to sell his property for big city building projects, and hes sentenced to be sent to an old age retirement home. On the morning hes to be taken away, the former balloon shop owner takes off in his house lifted by thousands of balloons and heads toward a remote section of Venezuela called Paradise Falls, a spot he and his late wife Ellie had always planned to visit but never got the chance. Carl is surprised to find young scout Russell [Jordan Nagai] tagging along hoping to earn his last merit badge from helping the elderly. Once they arrive at their destination, they're shocked to find themselves in the midst of once famous and now disgraced explorer Charles Muntz [Christopher Plummer] and his trained dog pack hunting a rare bird whose capture will allow Charles Muntz a chance to redeem his reputation. Carl and Russell, however, have made friends with the mother bird theyve named Kevin and will do everything in their power to return the mother to her chicks. Aiding them is one of Charles Muntzs mistreated dogs Dug [Bob Peterson] who loves the care and attention lavished on him by the sweet-natured Russell.

The screenplay by director Pete Docter and co-director Bob Peterson, based on a story by those two and Tom McCarthy, and touches on the theme of dreams unfulfilled and dreams realised through many different characters in the story. Part of the poignancy inherent in the story derives from each viewers having his own hopes for his life sometimes realized and sometimes put on hold for the indefinite future, and seeing these fantasies sometimes become a reality gives the film such an uplifting feeling of purpose and achievement that one cant help establishing a strong rooting interest with the tales protagonists. The master Pixar animators have now gotten so adept at storytelling that they can condense mountains of exposition into brief sequences that not only give us the background but accomplish it in such beautifully artistic ways. Two great examples are the newsreel which opens the film telling us about the fame and infamy of adventurer Charles Muntz and the unforgettably lovely and moving condensation of Carl and Ellies married life done in a five-minute pantomime sequence thats as terrific as anything you're likely to see at the movies. The animators also do little things just right, too: a graceful segue from Carl at Ellies funeral getting up, turning around, and entering the front door of his own house is accomplished with such unpretentious style and beauty that its breath-taking. So are numerous Road Runner-like sequences with Kevin escaping all of Charles Muntzs traps and, naturally, the climactic showdown between the good guys and the bad which plays completely fair with each sides strengths and weaknesses and delights all the more because its been set up so expertly all throughout the animated film.

As with all PIXAR films, the voice casting is sublimely superb. Ed Asner simply is Carl, grumpy and bitter at the beginning and slowly coming around to see that life is not over because his marriage is. Jordan Nagais hyperactive Russell is perfection, the embodiment of every restless kid who talks too fast and asks too many questions and cant sit still for a minute since he finds everything around him so thrilling. Co-director Bob Peterson does such an ingratiating job with the faithful Dug that he easily becomes everyones favourite pooch. Christopher Plummer takes his time establishing Charles Muntzs sinister qualities but once there relish his insidiousness.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film has been framed in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and is presented in a stunning 1080p encoded image. The transfer is in every way a showstopper, among the greatest animation encodes you're ever likely to see. The amount of incredible detail in clothing weaves, hair, leather, stone, leaves, even the grey stubble on Carls face is simply stunning and constantly jaw-dropping. Colours are eye-popping where appropriate (Kevin is one beautiful bird) and subdued when necessary, but those jungles of South America pop with the many varieties and shades of colour available to the animators, and theres no hint of banding anywhere in sight. Even the balloons, transparent when freshly inflated and becoming opaque as they lose buoyancy, are incredible to look at. Though the film was presented in 3D originally in cinemas in 2009, this is its home video 3D premiere. As with all of Pixars 3D films, the 3D has been applied in more subtle ways than in say, DreaWorks animated films. There is almost no outward projection apart from Kevins beak periodically poking beyond the frame for brief instances. But the amount of depth offered in the imagery is often breath-taking especially once the house goes aloft and floats above the countryside. The South American scenes likewise have such depth to the endless vistas that watching them in 3D is pure pleasure. The jungles seem wider and deeper, too, in this new transfer, and the animators have done a beautiful job placing characters and surrounding objects to achieve a striking view of the story told on multiple planes. The climactic aerial shots as Russell, Muntz, Carl, and Dug scurry high above the ground while the camera points downward might cause those with touches of vertigo some problems.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'UP' debuts on Blu-ray 3D with the same impressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio ES mix as was its 2009 2D counterpart and again it is just as impressive once again. Like everything else about this disc, it's just absolutely stunning. Atmosphere and ambience are always present, with the surround sound getting a vigorous workout, not just in the more action packed sequences, but in the way that the house breathes and groans once its lifted in the air, or the individualized balloons bumping into one another and letting out that brief squeak. I mean, it's just amazing. The amount of nuance is totally incredible. But most of all Michael Giacchinos Oscar-winning music, particularly the lilting waltz tune that underscores many of the Carl-Ellie moments, gets spread to wonderful effect in the fronts and rears. The audio here is a classy, adept sound mix that gives the film a wonderfully antique feel thats completely unique. All of the wonderful dialogue is perfect, and everything is well prioritized in the mix has been expertly recorded and has been placed in the centre channel. But also simple things like a window shattering just sound amazing, and not overwhelming, either. The action sequences are absolutely phenomenal and dwarf the biggest Hollywood action spectacles. It's just scores 100% total perfection and wins hands down, and the mixed sounds are beautiful and lovelier than ever.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Partly Cloudy [2009] [1080] [5:46] This charming animated short, directed by Pete Sohn, who served as inspiration for rambunctious Wilderness Explorer Russell. Everyone knows that the stork delivers babies, but where do the storks get the babies from? The answer lies up in the stratosphere, where cloud people sculpt babies from clouds and bring them to life. Gus, a lonely and insecure grey cloud, is a master at creating ""dangerous"" babies, including crocodiles, porcupines, rams and more. Gus's beloved creations are works of art, but more than a handful for his loyal delivery stork partner, Peck. As Gus's creations become more and more rambunctious, Peck's job gets harder and harder. How will Peck manage to handle both his hazardous cargo and his friend's fiery temperament? PIXAR has honed the amount of time it takes for you to fall in love with a character to around 30 seconds.

Special Feature: Dug's Special Mission [2009] [1080] [4:40] This is an all new animated short that follows talking dog Dug, right before he meets up with Carl and Russell. I really don't want to give away anything, but this might be the best new-short-for-home-video since Jack Jack Attack from 'The Incredibles' extra. According to Jonas Rivera, the producer of PIXAR's film UP, Dug's Special Mission ""is a little bit of the backstory of what Dug was actually doing out there on this mysterious mission when we meet him in UP."" In the short, Dug is instructed on how to catch the bird [Kevin] by Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, but their instructions are really intended to keep Dug away from them.

Special Feature: Adventure Is Out There! [2009] [1080] [22:17] A lot of times on these PIXAR discs, they'll talk about the research trip they went on to get information for a project. Like the brief trip the 'Ratatouille' gang spent racing around Paris trying to soak up the atmosphere. But this is the first time I've seen an honest-to-god documentary solely about one of these research expeditions, and the results are truly spectacular. They went down to the South American jungles with a guy named Adrian Warren, who has written and documented these plateau-type mountains you see in the film. Very few humans have ever set foot on the top of the mountain, so it was a real coup for a half dozen or so animators, technical guys, and the film's directors, to get to do it. Most of them talk about how otherworldly it was. This documentary mixes footage they actually shot of the journey, with interviews with the guys that went down there, and it's just spellbinding.

Special Feature: Alternative Scene: The Many Endings of Muntz [2009] [1080] [4:56] The villain Muntz was a real tough nut to crack. I remember a friend of mine was talking to somebody involved with Pixar, and they were telling him that they struggled with the Muntz character until the last possible minute. This brief but fascinating documentary showcases some of the possible deaths of Muntz, and how director Pete Docter had a fundamental opposition to even having a villain in the animated film, but felt it necessary in a thematic context. Also, without Muntz, you wouldn't have had a hilarious old man fight. One of the best bits in here is a kind of 'Shining' type moment, where Muntz gets lost in a labyrinth of rock formations; chilling stuff.

Sneak Previews: BRAVE 3D; PLANES 3D; Toys Story 3, The Princess & The Frog and DUMBO.

Finally, 'UP' 3D remains one of my favourite PIXAR films. In fact it is definitely up there as No. 1. The first 15 minutes sucks you in and punch you in the heart before sending you off on a whimsical tale of adventure and friendship. This package is virtually identical to its 2009 counterpart, save for a few different trailers on the 3D Blu-ray and, of course, the 2D Blu-ray. The 3D Blu-rays Video and Audio are high definition perfection, while the special features are still quite good. The question really is, is this double dip worthy? If you enjoy 3D at home, then by all means consider this a Must Own release. If you don't like 3D, then there's really no point in purchasing this Blu-ray, but I suppose you could just watch the 2D Blu-ray disc, but you would miss out on something totally spectacular. If you haven't yet seen, or purchased, 'UP' in high definition, then this animated film and especially the Blu-ray comes Highly Recommended and that is why it is such an honour to add this to my ever increasing PIXAR Blu-ray Collection and if you want to impress your friends, then this 3D Blu-ray is the one that will blow you away! Very Highly Recommended!
