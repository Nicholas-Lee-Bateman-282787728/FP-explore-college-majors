4912611,1,B0060ANPJW,"I bought this movie and was totally disappointed.  They made it sound as if it was based on actual serial killers and it is not.  Aside from the argument between the mother and the wife at the dinner table, the film is spent picking up people, drugging them, and killing them.  I didn't find it to be very gory, as the scenes in which this took place were quite short and you couldn't really see much.  Save your time and money.  I got sucked into buying ""The Ritual"" as well.  Haven't watched it, but if its like this movie it will be another waste of time and money.  At least they were cheap.  I'd give this zero stars if I could.",1392163200,,633,4.1735537190082646
4912612,1,B0060ANPJW,"Well, this plays like a home movie of a serial killing couple's exploits. Sounds like it could be fun, right? Not if your serial killers are the most banal suburbanites with a seriously limited intellect and interact like a trailer park, no humor version of Ted and Peg Bundy.
The tension is nil, as are the scares, and no intrigue or suspense will be found here. Its like watching a home movie of a butcher at work in his shop, except these butchers are interested in humans. The same amount of effort, intensity, and creativity that goes into hacking up a slab of beef at a slaughterhouse is how the Montgomerys go about it. Yawn. Case in point, their modus operandi is to drug a victim's drink and then kill them when they are out cold. Where's the conflict required for tension?! Didn't even bother to see it wrap up. There are few movies that have left me so cold.",1391904000,,869,4.4375
4912613,2,B0060ANPJW,"This is a movie that sounded good by description. The concept is very ingenious.

Opening moments looked promising. It then fell into the abyss of bad acting coupled
with unrealistic murder scenes that were gruesomely implied.

Gore is something I don't like. Should have not bought this DVD.

Mother of the killer was hot. I could tell she was a professional. It turned that she was a PhD.
She was associated with Scripps Oceanography Institute.

Here it is:  hubby and spouse decide to kill everyone for entertainment and cheap thrills.

Behold the meat clever (not Eldrige Cleaver) and garbage disposal to do the deed and latter to
leave no evidence.  An infinite universe, a nutshell: The film is presented as a collection of home movies from serial killers Wayne and Andrea Montgomery, middle-class suburban residents of Claymont, Delaware who film their sadistic crimes.",1390176000,,876,5.083916083916084

Well, I watched the movie all the way through. I did.

The cinematography was interesting in places, reminiscent of Dario Argento. Very texture-laden. Cinder-block walls, brick walls, textured stucco, the sets in the Montgomery's house had a scabby, WalMart-esque organized quality in a manner. Pleasing in a way. The problem is what other reviewers saw as ""grisly"" or ""gory"" was off-screen butchery. Some of it was on-screen, but both on-screen and off-screen lacked a kinetic quality. Watch ""Videodrome"" and the video of abattoir had water in it, to give it kinetic quality. There is nothing in the cinematography of ""Head Case"" to suggest kinetic action. What makes ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" funny is kinetic action. ""Head Case"" is fake-umentary that resembles a video of a socially-awkward teenager who stammers a lot. If fake blood that doesn't seem to come from anywhere, just magically appearing is ""disturbing"" then this movie is disturbing.

Somebody once said something to the effect that not showing everything adds to the terror of a movie. Well, this movie has gone too far and shows nothing.

Somebody else said in a play, you have to act large, on camera, for a movie you have to be much smaller. I don't know that the director or the actors in this movie ever heard this, especially Barbara Lessin (Andrea Montgomery). The acting is far too large for this movie. Its flat and overdone, simultaneously somehow.

The actors may be improvising, but they aren't doing a good job of it. There's lots of stammering, lots of moments where it seems like Paul McCloskey doesn't quite know what to say. If they are serial killers, why are they saying things like ""Ew! That's gross!"" Um, yeah. I'm improvising too. The dialog is terrible.

The background score, by the way, is pointless. Why are we adding background music that leaks out of old elevators to something that's supposed to be a ""pieced-together"" archive? The music detracts from the movie, doesn't add to it.

I see Hershel Gordon Lewis in demented-tones of this movie, I can see similarities to Hannibal Lecter (""I prefer to eat the rude whenever possible""), I see some Hitchcock-ian female figures badgering and harassing Wayne Montgomery in the movie. I see lots of Eli Roth ala ""Hostel"". I see some David Lynch from some of his lesser known shorts or ""Eraserhead"". Why does every aspiring film director borrow from David Lynch?? No, stop don't answer that question. The movie is original-ish, but a seemingly endless parade of stammering in a background melange of borrowed pieces from other horror movies. Really, the nods to horror classics isn't too bad. Its not that the movie comes off as derivative, but it comes off as amateurish, poorly done and lacking in polish.

If you like movies with definitive endings and hate movies that leave room for a sequel (or insist a sequel exist for the sake of completeness), then this movie will really ruin your day.

Some people might see these qualities as pluses and may want to watch the movie. Feel free; I don't recommend this movie in any degree. It isn't as funny or farcical as Herschel Gordon Lewis. It lacks good taste, real gore and the things that separate boring university lectures from entertaining movies.

2/10 (For some of the lighting and the texture of the cinematography)",1362614400,2,3343,4.953571428571428
8490244,1,B0060ANPJW,"If you like a bunch of people talking over one another, and nothing at all scary, then this is the movie for you! This is AWFUL and I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK PLEASE, but there does not seem to be any way to request money back from Amazon for a movie order!",1495756800,,257,3.8679245283018866
8490245,3,B0060ANPJW,"I am only reviewing the Amazon prime version that I paid for. The whole film is voiced over by the directors so I couldn't watch it. You can't follow it with people talking throughout the whole thing. I also have hearing loss, so have to use the captions, and it was nonsense. So many people speaking, it was unable to clearly process the conversations. If there was another option for removing the directors narration, I couldn't find it. I'm giving it 3 stars for concept, as I was able to watch it elsewhere, but wanted to let people know what you may end up paying for.",1490140800,,573,4.415094339622642
8490246,1,B0060ANPJW,Horrible. A true waste of time for fans of the horror genre.,1476835200,,60,4.083333333333333
8490247,4,B0060ANPJW,Had to watch it from another source. The streaming version had the commentary over the movie audio and it couldn't be turned off. Otherwise I enjoyed the movie.,1475539200,,160,4.75
8490248,3,B0060ANPJW,"I'm going to give this movie a three star rating. It's slow paced and the acting is somewhat believable. But I believe it's real strength is the husband and wife characters. It's what I think real serial killers are, cold blooded and bland, not colorful, intriguing individuals like Norman Bates or Hannibal Lecter. To them killing is as normal as a handshake which is why they act so casual about what they do. The husband seemed satisfied with every grisly act and his wife couldn't get enough pleasure filming it. I'm not saying this is a great film, but it is interesting to see these people go on with their daily lives and the thought that they act no different from people you interact with every day is what makes it so unsettling. It's not meant to be entertaining, but an in your face reminder that the predators are out there and we have to be vigilant against these human monsters. So I'll give it a fair rating of 3 stars.",1472169600,,935,4.473684210526316

8490250,2,B0060ANPJW,I have never seen anything quite like this. A different take on footage movies. To bad the acting was mediocre.,1435968000,,111,4.6
8490251,2,B0060ANPJW,"This isn't a horror movie. It's just a boring and protracted collection of videotaped killings. There's nothing in this video that adds to the art of the horror genre, nor does it tell a story, nor is it even interesting. I don't think many horror fans would find this video worth their time or money, period, with the exception of the small niche of people who find the act of killing interesting. If anything, this is just a tedious compilation, narrated by a truly annoying lead actress, and a browbeaten serial killer. And how they included Brinke Stevens as the killer's mom, when the killer's wife appears twice Brinke's age (even though this is explained in the video as the killer having married an older woman, Brinke looks like she is actually the same age as, or even younger than the killer - I'd have believed she was the killer's sister more than the casting decision made by the director here), is just another level of lameness tacked on to this hunk of junk. Definitely take a pass on this, even if you find it for free at some point. This is the kind of film that detracts from the whole horror movie genre and, to me, was simply a lazy effort at making a found footage movie. And it is only disturbing from the aspect that it's just killings, with no real story, for the sake of showing killings shot in first person. Lame acting, lame directing, lame movie.",1427414400,2,1377,4.512
8490252,4,B0060ANPJW,"Well..I agree with everyone that it is a gory fake doc on a husband and wife couple who lure and kill people for thrills. Its in black and white which kinda adds to the found footage or camcorder effect,and ...I kinda liked it. The husband seemed totally hen pecked ,but the wife (whoever played her)was good. Loud,boisterous,kinda a bully,yet could be charming,she really helped the movie. Of course I am partial to serial killer movies(even though there was no sexual aspect to their killing) and found footage,I just enjoyed it more than some others(so many duds).I struggled between 3 stars and 4,and because I might watch it again(free on you tube)I decided togive it 4. I can totlaly understand why the majority of folks don't like it. Black and white,kinda slow,no killings are shown,etc.",1413590400,2,795,4.940298507462686
8490253,1,B0060ANPJW,"Shot in black and white this pseudo-documentary was done on a modest budget. I don't normally do this, but 10 minutes into the film, I hit the eject button (I made it through Erasure Head). The monotone commentary was of the most boring nature. Sure, this was by design as we contrast this ""normal"" aspect of their life to their unorthodox crimes. This would normally be a cult classic like ""Psychos in Love."" The problem was I couldn't make it that far. There was no hook at the beginning of the film.

5 stars for insomniacs.",1406246400,,527,4.489583333333333
