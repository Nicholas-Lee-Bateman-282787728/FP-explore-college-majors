7851009,5,6303467415,"Straight to the point, this is an excellent and quite original ""social"" Spaghetti Western. This film (entitled Blood and Guns in English) was directed in 1969 by Italian director Giulio Petroni. The film takes place In Mexico, at the beginning of the twentieth century, right after the ending of the Revolution and upon the assentation of President Madero. Jesus Maria Moran (a.k.a. Tepepa) is to be executed by Colonel Cascorro's men (played by the great Orson Welles). However, doctor Henry Price (played by John Steiner), an Englishman, arrives in his car and saves him. Of course, Tepepa was a hero of the Revolution, plagued with moral highs and other very low down sides. As it turned out, Dr. Price's saving Tepepa had a hidden aim for revenge linked to Tepepa's raping of a young woman. In addition to these interesting personal aspects used to build these three solid characters and a good story, you have the ups and downs of political situation in the post-revolutionary Mexico. In short, not much seem to have changed socially after all. In case you are wondering, the film is full of action, and is fast paced. A short interview to director Patroni confirms this is full length, integral version of the film (131 minutes). Overall then, this is a very entertaining, full of action movie. In the tradition of Italian cinema, this film has great exterior picture and scenery, highly recommended in my view.

Technically, this German, Kino Lorber transfer is crisp clear. Indeed, some face close ups looks even Blue-ray quality. The image comes in widescreen format, with audios in German, Italian and English. No subtitles are available except for some film footage inserts with original Italian dialogs. Extras include an interview to Giulio Petroni  (Italian dialog with German subtitles), two deleted scenes (with Petroni comments in Italian language), the German and Italian trailers. Finally, please note this is a PAL, region free DVD.",1433030400,,1952,5.077881619937695

TEPEPA aka BLOOD & GUNS (1968) is an excellent film which takes a leisurely pace to tell the tale of gluttony and deceit among three men in Mexico (Thomas Milian, Orson Welles, & John Steiner) after the Mexican Revolution. The backstory of revolutionary, ""TEPEPA"" played by Milian is the highlight of the film and is extremely well-acted, evoking sympathy for his character, his passion and disillusionment and it just may be his finest performance. As an Orson Wells fan, It is a pleasure to view his presentation of a ruthless Mexican general in the story (complete with mustache and dark-tanned make-up). I only wish he had a little more screen time.

The wide-screen transfer looks near-pristine and is such a pleasure to view when compared to many other poor transfers of this film and other Euro-westerns. Much of the film was shot in the desert with colors that are clear and vibrant. This Koch Media release of the film is dubbed in English, Italian, & German. Extras are unfortunately in the German language and include an audio commentary for the film by the legendary director & co-author, Giulio Petroni, a featurette called ""Freude und Revolution"" which includes an interview with the director. Additional extras include a short scene cut from the film (with commentary,) as well as German and Italian trailers, a nice picture gallery of various colorful posters, lobby cards and other movie related artwork. Overall, an exceptional package. It's too bad that many of us non-German speaking Americans can't fully indulge in all that this Koch Media release has to offer, but for now the beautiful transfer of the film is reason enough to own it.

If you're considering purchasing this release, keep in mind the format is Region 2 and will not play on regular American DVD or Blu-ray players. If you're a fan of Euro-westerns, as I am, you may want to consider purchasing an all-regions player. It's worth the small investment. Many of the best releases of Euro-westerns are in non-American formats. I rate this package 5 out of 5 bullets.",1387929600,,2144,4.919889502762431

7851012,3,6303467415,"Somewhat scanty production values, Giulio Petroni's sometimes lackluster direction, and some brutal editing (it would be wonderful to see the ""full length"" Italian version, which runs some 30 minutes longer than the American release), hamper but never ruin the enjoyment of this intriguing film.  Set in 1913 Mexico, just before the assasination of President Francisco Madero (whose attempts at land reform figure prominently in the plot), ""Tepepa"" (its Italian name, and much more sensible than the ridiculous ""Blood and Guns"") has three major selling points: a wonderfully unctuous performance by Orson Welles as Colonel Cascorro (Welles riffs on his own ""Touch of Evil"" character from a decade earlier); Tomas Milian's surprisingly complex title character (a Zapata-like bandit leader); and the rather baroque but wholly engaging screenplay.  In fact, the Kane-like mystery of  the plot (just who is this ""Tepepa,"" really?) may well have been part of the allure for Welles (who probably also needed the money).  The action scenes are rather perfunctory, but look for a truly rousing speech (a la Che Guevera) from Milian (who was never better, although he went on to make over a dozen more spaghetti westerns) halfway through the film and its ironic counterpart at the conclusion, when Milian announces that Welles is ""about to make a speech"" (he never does, of course).  The flashback where Milian gives up his guns to Madero is priceless: there's probably no better indictment of the inanity of war and the continual oppression of the landless classes.  (As Welles says at one point to the peasants: ""You don't like it that the landowner has returned?  Too bad."")  But most impressive is the conclusion, in which an English doctor (who wants to kill ""Tepepa""--whomever that really is) has to decide whether to save Milian, and whether he can live with an ideology that chooses a revolution over a woman's life.  This is by no means a feminist film, but it is a highly thoughtful spaghetti western, as one might expect from Franco Solinas, the screenwriter of such masterpieces as ""The Battle of Algiers,"" ""The Wide Blue Road,"" and ""The Big Gundown.""  Ennio Morricone's musical score is uninspired but appropriately rousing.  Recommended, so long as you can handle the bad print, bad editing, and sometimes confusingly truncated narrative.",1031616000,,2343,5.188328912466844
