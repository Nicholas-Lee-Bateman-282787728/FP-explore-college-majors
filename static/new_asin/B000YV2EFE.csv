3036526,3,B000YV2EFE,"Several years ago Tokyo experienced a nasty earthquake.  The Lynch sisters were there doing global warming research when the quake hit.  But now the footage they filmed of the event shows that it was not a simple earthquake.
Like Godzilla Vs. the Blair Witch, this is raw footage of two young American women in a foreign city when disaster strikes.  But soon after the quake hits they learn it is not a simple quake.  There is something, or somethings, under the ground.  Their flight through the city trying to find the American embassy amid chaos and language barriers is the true subject of the film.  Occasionally we get glimpses of the tentacles or worms of what is really causing the destruction.
If you think this sounds a lot like Cloverfield then you are not mistaken.  The effects are usually quite good throughout.  The format can be too choppy for some viewers and the camera work is not steady so keep the Dramamine handy.  But if you like raw or edgy films and have a yen for monster flicks then this one should be up your alley.

3036528,1,B000YV2EFE,"I think Ed Wood spent more money on Plan 9 From Outer Space. Probably the most expensive part of this movie was the flight to Tokyo.

I absolutely hate the herky-jerky camera and I wasn't kidding about the title of this review as it really did give me a headache. After the first few minutes, I kept wondering when they'd go to a regular steady camera, but it never happened. The next thing I know, a half hour went by and by then I just didn't have the energy to get up and hit the eject button. It was like driving by a car wreck where you just can't stop looking. As I sat there, I kept hoping something would happen to redeem the awful acting and story movement, but it stayed consistently annoying to the end.

The icky bug is almost non-existent. You hear a little roar once in a while, and see the odd octopus arm flash in the background. The art on the DVD box is highly misleading as you NEVER see the monster in as much detail as in that painting.

I can't give it no stars because the rating system would not allow it. I would have given it one star for originality, but wait... Blair Witch???

3036530,1,B000YV2EFE,"Another piece of dreck from the Asylum.  These guys are quick to pick up on upcoming theatrical releases and crank out low budget rip-offs.  This time 'Cloverfield"" is their victim.  Most of this film's budget seems to have been spent on creating colorful patterns of video tape noise that shows up every time there's a little bit of action.  I don't know which made me more nauseous, the bickering weepy sisters supposedly making the documentary or the jerky swaying handheld camera footage of peoples feet as they run around.

3036531,1,B000YV2EFE,"Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by doing this: Downloading the Cloverfield trailer, watching it once and then waiting for its release. Not only will those two minutes be better than this entire movie, but you'd be excited for Cloverfield's release.

Monster comes from the same studio that brought us Transmorphers and Snakes on a Train, thus you can conclude that it's utter trash completely ripping off its bigger brother, in this case Cloverfield, J.J. Abrams, at the time of this review, yet-to-be-released monster movie.

Like that movie, this movie is about a monster that (instead of New York) attacks Tokyo for reasons unknown. Apparently a cover-up, the monster reigns terror on the denizens of Tokyo and two American filmmakers. These American filmmakers run around the city avoiding the monster while filming whatever they can with their American camera. The two Americans in distress run around, scream, flail and tell everyone with a pulse they're American in the hope of getting out of Tokyo. All of this running around like a chicken with its head cut off action is filmed through a handheld camera and really annoys rather intrigue because the monster is hardly shown. At all.

In fact all you really see is a few tentacles every now and then, legs, some buildings and smoke, not to mention audiovisual distortions that make the Cloverfield trailer look like a Steven Spielberg film. The acting is horrible, with ignorant line after ignorant line spewed out and the action is, well, something a notch below action. Actually, the only action in this movie is the occasional rough camera shake, fall and rumble. Not to mention the monsters roar which is heard around five-hundred million times. With all that noise everywhere, it's hard to find out what the hell the plot is, what everyone is saying and how everything ends. But really, what makes this movie such a big rip is the fact you don't see the monster in its entirety.

It's like having sex with someone you love and then finding out it was really just you the whole time. You feel dirty, you feel ashamed and you wonder why the hell you didn't realize beforehand and in return become slightly more retarded than when you started. All in all, I gave this movie too much time (and hour and a half) and too much credit. This review is way more detailed than the actual movie. Bleh.",1199836800,20,2362,4.7818627450980395
3036532,2,B000YV2EFE,"Monster was The Asylum's knockoff version of Cloverfield.  As some huge and largely unseen monster (definitely not Godzilla, Gamera, or any of their historic enemies) attacks the city of Tokyo, we follow the story through the videotapes made by two Americans as they struggle to understand what is happening and try to make their way out of the danger zone.  I personally love this type of documentary-style horror/ science fiction film, but Monster doesn't really deliver.  Well, it does deliver tons of annoying dialogue and way too many video distortions and blank spaces, but it doesn't deliver much enjoyment.  The only thing I took away from this movie is the fact that Panasonic apparently makes a pretty darned rugged video camera.

Sisters Sarah and Erin Lynch travel to Tokyo to film a documentary on global warming.  As they are interviewing the Minister of Environment, a massive earthquake strikes the city and they are forced to scramble down into the basement.  One man cryptically informs them, in broken English, that it's not an earthquake but will say no more.  After a while, the girls make their way up to the surface to find pandemonium and a burning city - and one of them sees something unbelievable through the smoke.  Still, it takes a while for them to realize that a real-life monster is behind all of the mayhem, despite the fact that the creature doesn't exactly go about his work quietly.  Anyway, you've soon got jets and helicopters zooming overhead causing more explosions, leaving the girls to fend for themselves as they desperately search for anyone who can speak English in the increasingly depopulated city.

Basically, the girls just run all around the city in desperation, occasionally catching a glimpse of a giant tail or huge octopus-like limbs.  There is way too much argument about filming everything, oodles of ""I just want to go home"" laments, Blair Witch confession moments, and hopeless attempts to converse with Japanese natives.  I do think that some of the special effects are pretty good for a low-budget movie, but the filmmakers take the whole ""realism"" thing way too far.  The video constantly cuts in and out, loses audio, or becomes distorted, leaving the viewer frustrated and increasingly annoyed as time goes on.  Half the time, you can't even tell what they're saying (although the script's hopelessly repetitive quality makes it pretty easy to guess) because of background noise.  Then there are the moments when you can clearly hear normal traffic noises as the girls search in vain for any signs of life.

If I, a huge fan of this genre and of Asylum, didn't enjoy this movie, I very much doubt that many others will, either.  It's not even in the same league as Cloverfield.",1310428800,,2741,4.921739130434783
3036533,1,B000YV2EFE,"If you buy this movie used for .01$ you are overpaying. It's a Cloverfield wannabe shot on a budget of about 50.00. The director should have gone to film school or at least taken the time to learn anything about sound tech, and it would really have helped them to hire a screenwriter that was out of the third grade, ( no offense to third graders intended). The other two top bad movies? They would be ""Blair Witch"" and ""Barry Lyndon"". But at least ""Barry Lyndon"" had decent costuming.

Then an earthquake strikes---but it's not an earthquake, it's a ...a...Monster!  If this seems vaguely familiar, it is not the opening premise of Cloverfield this writer is summarizing, but Monster.  Indeed, almost scene for scene, this movie practically parallels Abrahms disaster film of the same ilk.  This is not to say that our leads, Sarah Lynch and Erin Sullivan, don't give it their all.  There is genuine tension in the film and, as in Cloverfield, you will be compelled to keep viewing, if not to see the fate of the girls, then to at least catch a glimpse of that Monster.  First, however, you must survive the annoying camerawork.  Initially, having the leads shoot the film themselves might have seemed like a good idea on paper, but there is a reason it is called amateur video, and there is an equally important reason why those kinds of videos should never leave the family dining room where they should be showed once and then forgotten about.  Director Estenberg would have done better to have balanced the realism of amateur video footage with the innate need of the viewer to have it be watchable!",1287187200,,1236,4.769953051643192

3036539,4,B000YV2EFE,"""Monster"" is a film in the style of Cloverfield or the Blair Witch Project.  We know that the protagonists are not going to come to a happy end.  We know the film footage is going to be from a jerky handheld.  ""Monster"" has no music, no fancy edits or scene transitions, nada.  If you do not like that type of film, then this is not the film for you.  I do like that type of film, so I give it four stars.

The actresses run around filming the destruction of Tokyo.  The actresses look good on camera and have pleasant voices; those qualities are extremely important because the women are in every shot.  Will they escape?  Will the world be warned of the monsters that global warming and oceanic pollution awakens?  Nah.  Will the herky-jerky camerawork make me nauseous?  Yeah.  More of a plot, more of a non-monstrous threat (conspiracy, military, criminals, whatever), more monster screentime would have kicked this up to five stars.

With the exception of the Times-Square-style shots, this whole movie could have been filmed in Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles.  The end credits say that Los Angeles was a location, so perhaps Little Tokyo was used.  The DVD has no ""Commentary"" feature, so the locations will remain a mystery.

This is the fifth asylum film that I have watched in the past 72 hours.  It is the most effective movie, though ""The Land that Time Forgot"" is more fun.",1278288000,2,1391,4.631147540983607

3036541,1,B000YV2EFE,"When I slipped this DVD into the player, my first scream came when I saw that it was made by Asylum Productions.
I'm sure Asylum means well since I don't think any movie maker deliberately tries to make the most gawd-awful movie abominations in film history but Asylum does, eh, have this reputation.
Well, my second scream came when I saw in the very first scene that this was going to be another one of those totally horrendous single-camera technique--like the infamous movie it's ripping off ""Cloverfield""--an experience that still has me leaping from my bed at night as my nightmares bring back the truly nauseating results of trying to enjoy a movie where the camera bounces all over the screen.
In ""Monster,"" the moran behind the camera suggests a direct descendancy of the retardate who filmed ""Cloverfied."" We see endless shots of sidewalks and people's shoes and then the camera tilts so that we see the spectacular skyline of Japan reduced to several blank buildings.
As the two girls (I think they may have been sisters or escapees from the nearest mental hospital)run from something we never see, we then stare spellbound as cars move leisurely down the street.  Glimpses of fellow escapees portray people who seem alarmingly indifferent to the invasion of a momster.
There are scenes of running where we again see never-ending images of sidewalks and slow moving cars. Occasionaly, we hear the gasping of the two girls and we wonder why a camera is capturing the most invisible attack by a monster in screen history.
At one point, I thought I spied a tentacle in the right corner of the screen but this turned out to be a tree limb.
If one stayed with this movie, then I'm sure the monster of the title would have been truly terrifying but when I finished reading my National Enquirer that I was enjoying while thrilling to ""Monster"" I'm afraid I had other things to do. i think ""Monster"" should receive every award out there but I don""t know who gives one for the biggest bore in movie history>",1275350400,,2009,4.7236467236467234

It kills me to do this but it appears that I have no choice; I really did not enjoy this film. Normally [and anybody who has read my reviews will tell you] I look towards the positives of a film a like to rate it on that, normally I enjoy even the worst b movies ever. This film how ever is just not really all that good, and it disappoints me because I actually like The Asylum [the production company]. These guys are well known for their mockumentaries [cheap rip offs] but to their credit they also do original work as well. This one obviously is a mockumentay of ""Cloverfield"", and that film is an Oscar worthy film compared to this one. It is seriously an annoyance to the eyes; it is right up there with what I said about that girl in my review of ""Prey"".

The story of this film is as follows; tell me if it sounds familiar at times. Two American filmmakers head to Tokyo to film a documentary on global warming, sounds ok right? Once there they are interrupted by a monster [cue terrifying music in the back ground] attacking the city, thing is this monster is as big as the skyscrapers that over look the city. Well you guess that much because you never see the monster minus a few shots of its tentacles. So now the race is on to get out of the city alive and oh yeah film this thing every step of the way no matter how much it gets you into trouble. Sounds interesting..............right?

Erik Estenberg {director} and David Michael Latt {producer} must have written this film in less then 20 minutes, and I know they the only did this film for the quick money. Normally both of these guys do much better with their films from this company, but this is just beyond belief. I have no clue if the script was really this bad or if it was just because of how terrible the actors delivered it, but something is wrong here. But let's get to the real problems here, the awful acting and the even worse camera work. The acting in this film is no where to even being close to believable, even for this type of film it is bad. Sarah Lieving and Erin Sullivan are down right annoying in this film, Sarah more so then Erin. They start out ok but once the attack starts, they loose all focus on making this believable, though Erin seems to be a much better actor then Sarah. Also the camera work in this film is horrible; ""Cloverfield and Blair Witch"" must have been shot by the guy who did the Lord of the Rings compared to this. Really the film is so hard to follow and it even hurts your eyes sometimes trying to watch this, the editing maybe to blame here but man was it bad. The film actually cuts out at times and skips, and the picture gets interrupted, and color goes off, and sound goes down, and man this is just hard to watch. I really don't know how to explain this problem in very much detail; I guess all that kinda makes sense with a creature destroying things around you.

Don't think every thing about this film is bad though, the first 10 or 15 minutes is ok. I mean that the camera work is not horrible and the acting is some what ok up until the first attack scene. And the stuff I mentioned above about all the stuff with the camera work and the picture, color, and sound and stuff while it is extremely annoying may also be ingenious. Don't get it wrong I absolutely hate that stuff and that stuff made me dislike the film, but it also helped the company out a lot. Think about that for a second, because they did that stuff a certain times they could hide the budget better. No good shots of the creature because the picture went out, reasonable because some cameras may act like that and they didn't have to spend money on creature shots. Now that does not excuse this film from being what it is, but it does make sense from a business stand point.

I think that this is probably one of if not the worst movies I have ever watched; honestly it should never have been made. I' am starting to think I made a bad decision in purchasing this, what do you think?",1221609600,3,3990,4.265521796565389
3036546,4,B000YV2EFE,"This is a film to love and cherish (for all the wrong reasons). I love the fact that these two women basically came to Japan and wandered all over the city with a poor script and a low budget. The results aren't exactly startling but I certainly give it an A for effort. Erin Sullivan is her usual divine YouTube self.

3036547,1,B000YV2EFE,"Speaking of rubbish, that Blair Witch idea has a lot to answer for! Shaky, supposedly 'real' home movie footage of events which is then passed off as fact, is so pass now, I can't believe people are still attempting to pull this off, especially when the result is as dire as this one! I don't believe I have ever given just one star to any movie as I always try to see the positive in most things and try not to say anything at all if I can't say something nice, but I feel I must make an exception for this.
I imagine it's a low budget copy of the idea behind ""Cloverfield"" (though I haven't seen that yet) and is so poorly done and so dismal I'm amazed it ever got given a dvd release.
The two women who are whom the 'story' is based around are so obviously acting and aware of it and so fake and uninteresting in every way that it was extremely tedious trying to stick this out 'til the end. That, coupled with the shaky, dodgy camerawork, no doubt deliberately dodgy in attempts to cover up the fact that nothing much was actually happening and they couldn't afford much in the way of effects, so the frequent black screen, pixelated picture, almost constant lines of interference, and other assorted unwatchable attempts used to convey a supposedly real filming of events, was all done to mask what really was being filmed, namely just normal life in a normal street scene in any big city, in this case, Tokyo, and if they thought that making the picture barely watchable was meant to be convincing that the events really were taking place and they were running for their lives, hence dodgy picture from shaky hand held camera, then they must think that anyone watching must be stupid. And, seeing as I sat through this endurance test for one and a half hours, I'm thinking that I must be!
If the events had been real, then the person doing the filming would have filmed events other than a bit of smoke coming from buildings and a fake looking octopus type monster waving its tentacles around, but the sister doing the filming, (though they took turns) preferred to focus mainly on her sister instead of the supposed exciting events taking place all around them! Again, obviously this was to cover up the lack of budget, if not it was extremely pretentious but ultimately naive attempts at making events look 'real'. If so, they didn't pull it off. There wasn't even anyone in it worth feasting your eyes on to make it more worthwhile from an eye candy point of view. There were a couple of cute young Japanese guys, one we saw briefly before he got killed in the back of a van they sheltered in, and another one in a light grey hoody, who we saw even less of but who did look really cute, so even more black marks to the filmmakers who could at least have made this dire effort more watchable by getting some decent close ups of these cute guys, but no, even that opportunity was passed over in favour of pretentious nonsense. It was only one pound in a discount shop, but even so, I still feel like I should ask for my money back! At least I can have a good old moan about it here on Amazon and warn others about how bad it is!

I got fooled by the picture on the cover of the dvd, showing giant tentacles encircling a tower building, but you don't get to see that anywhere in the movie, it's obviously just cover art that they've used to try and make it look as though it's a scene from the movie. It certainly isn't! It is on the cover to make you think you'll see it in the film, so don't be fooled by that if you see the dvd lurking in some discount store, even if it's only a penny, it's not worth it, it isn't even good in a bad way, not even funny, it's just awful.",1214179200,4,3680,4.302593659942363

3271028,1,B000YV2EFE,"Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by doing this: Downloading the Cloverfield trailer, watching it once and then waiting for its release. Not only will those two minutes be better than this entire movie, but you'd be excited for Cloverfield's release.

Monster comes from the same studio that brought us Transmorphers and Snakes on a Train, thus you can conclude that it's utter trash completely ripping off its bigger brother, in this case Cloverfield, J.J. Abrams, at the time of this review, yet-to-be-released monster movie.

Like that movie, this movie is about a monster that (instead of New York) attacks Tokyo for reasons unknown. Apparently a cover-up, the monster reigns terror on the denizens of Tokyo and two American filmmakers. These American filmmakers run around the city avoiding the monster while filming whatever they can with their American camera. The two Americans in distress run around, scream, flail and tell everyone with a pulse they're American in the hope of getting out of Tokyo. All of this running around like a chicken with its head cut off action is filmed through a handheld camera and really annoys rather intrigue because the monster is hardly shown. At all.

In fact all you really see is a few tentacles every now and then, legs, some buildings and smoke, not to mention audiovisual distortions that make the Cloverfield trailer look like a Steven Spielberg film. The acting is horrible, with ignorant line after ignorant line spewed out and the action is, well, something a notch below action. Actually, the only action in this movie is the occasional rough camera shake, fall and rumble. Not to mention the monsters roar which is heard around five-hundred million times. With all that noise everywhere, it's hard to find out what the hell the plot is, what everyone is saying and how everything ends. But really, what makes this movie such a big rip is the fact you don't see the monster in its entirety.

It's like having sex with someone you love and then finding out it was really just you the whole time. You feel dirty, you feel ashamed and you wonder why the hell you didn't realize beforehand and in return become slightly more retarded than when you started. All in all, I gave this movie too much time (and hour and a half) and too much credit. This review is way more detailed than the actual movie. Bleh.",1199836800,20,2362,4.7818627450980395
3271029,2,B000YV2EFE,"Monster was The Asylum's knockoff version of Cloverfield.  As some huge and largely unseen monster (definitely not Godzilla, Gamera, or any of their historic enemies) attacks the city of Tokyo, we follow the story through the videotapes made by two Americans as they struggle to understand what is happening and try to make their way out of the danger zone.  I personally love this type of documentary-style horror/ science fiction film, but Monster doesn't really deliver.  Well, it does deliver tons of annoying dialogue and way too many video distortions and blank spaces, but it doesn't deliver much enjoyment.  The only thing I took away from this movie is the fact that Panasonic apparently makes a pretty darned rugged video camera.

Sisters Sarah and Erin Lynch travel to Tokyo to film a documentary on global warming.  As they are interviewing the Minister of Environment, a massive earthquake strikes the city and they are forced to scramble down into the basement.  One man cryptically informs them, in broken English, that it's not an earthquake but will say no more.  After a while, the girls make their way up to the surface to find pandemonium and a burning city - and one of them sees something unbelievable through the smoke.  Still, it takes a while for them to realize that a real-life monster is behind all of the mayhem, despite the fact that the creature doesn't exactly go about his work quietly.  Anyway, you've soon got jets and helicopters zooming overhead causing more explosions, leaving the girls to fend for themselves as they desperately search for anyone who can speak English in the increasingly depopulated city.

Basically, the girls just run all around the city in desperation, occasionally catching a glimpse of a giant tail or huge octopus-like limbs.  There is way too much argument about filming everything, oodles of ""I just want to go home"" laments, Blair Witch confession moments, and hopeless attempts to converse with Japanese natives.  I do think that some of the special effects are pretty good for a low-budget movie, but the filmmakers take the whole ""realism"" thing way too far.  The video constantly cuts in and out, loses audio, or becomes distorted, leaving the viewer frustrated and increasingly annoyed as time goes on.  Half the time, you can't even tell what they're saying (although the script's hopelessly repetitive quality makes it pretty easy to guess) because of background noise.  Then there are the moments when you can clearly hear normal traffic noises as the girls search in vain for any signs of life.

If I, a huge fan of this genre and of Asylum, didn't enjoy this movie, I very much doubt that many others will, either.  It's not even in the same league as Cloverfield.",1310428800,,2741,4.921739130434783

First, however, you must survive the annoying camerawork.

We know the film footage is going to be from a jerky handheld.  ""Monster"" has no music, no fancy edits or scene transitions, nada.  If you do not like that type of film, then this is not the film for you.  I do like that type of film, so I give it four stars.

The actresses run around filming the destruction of Tokyo.  The actresses look good on camera and have pleasant voices; those qualities are extremely important because the women are in every shot.  Will they escape?  Will the world be warned of the monsters that global warming and oceanic pollution awakens?  Nah.  Will the herky-jerky camerawork make me nauseous?  Yeah.

I'm sure Asylum means well since I don't think any movie maker deliberately tries to make the most gawd-awful movie abominations in film history but Asylum does, eh, have this reputation.
Well, my second scream came when I saw in the very first scene that this was going to be another one of those totally horrendous single-camera technique--like the infamous movie it's ripping off ""Cloverfield""--an experience that still has me leaping from my bed at night as my nightmares bring back the truly nauseating results of trying to enjoy a movie where the camera bounces all over the screen.
In ""Monster,"" the moran behind the camera suggests a direct descendancy of the retardate who filmed ""Cloverfied."" We see endless shots of sidewalks and people's shoes and then the camera tilts so that we see the spectacular skyline of Japan reduced to several blank buildings.
As the two girls (I think they may have been sisters or escapees from the nearest mental hospital)run from something we never see, we then stare spellbound as cars move leisurely down the street.  Glimpses of fellow escapees portray people who seem alarmingly indifferent to the invasion of a momster.
There are scenes of running where we again see never-ending images of sidewalks and slow moving cars. Occasionaly, we hear the gasping of the two girls and we wonder why a camera is capturing the most invisible attack by a monster in screen history.
At one point, I thought I spied a tentacle in the right corner of the screen but this turned out to be a tree limb.
If one stayed with this movie, then I'm sure the monster of the title would have been truly terrifying but when I finished reading my National Enquirer that I was enjoying while thrilling to ""Monster"" I'm afraid I had other things to do. i think ""Monster"" should receive every award out there but I don""t know who gives one for the biggest bore in movie history>",1275350400,,2009,4.7236467236467234

It kills me to do this but it appears that I have no choice; I really did not enjoy this film. Normally [and anybody who has read my reviews will tell you] I look towards the positives of a film a like to rate it on that, normally I enjoy even the worst b movies ever. This film how ever is just not really all that good, and it disappoints me because I actually like The Asylum [the production company]. These guys are well known for their mockumentaries [cheap rip offs] but to their credit they also do original work as well. This one obviously is a mockumentay of ""Cloverfield"", and that film is an Oscar worthy film compared to this one. It is seriously an annoyance to the eyes; it is right up there with what I said about that girl in my review of ""Prey"".

The story of this film is as follows; tell me if it sounds familiar at times. Two American filmmakers head to Tokyo to film a documentary on global warming, sounds ok right? Once there they are interrupted by a monster [cue terrifying music in the back ground] attacking the city, thing is this monster is as big as the skyscrapers that over look the city. Well you guess that much because you never see the monster minus a few shots of its tentacles. So now the race is on to get out of the city alive and oh yeah film this thing every step of the way no matter how much it gets you into trouble. Sounds interesting..............right?

Erik Estenberg {director} and David Michael Latt {producer} must have written this film in less then 20 minutes, and I know they the only did this film for the quick money. Normally both of these guys do much better with their films from this company, but this is just beyond belief. I have no clue if the script was really this bad or if it was just because of how terrible the actors delivered it, but something is wrong here. But let's get to the real problems here, the awful acting and the even worse camera work. The acting in this film is no where to even being close to believable, even for this type of film it is bad. Sarah Lieving and Erin Sullivan are down right annoying in this film, Sarah more so then Erin. They start out ok but once the attack starts, they loose all focus on making this believable, though Erin seems to be a much better actor then Sarah. Also the camera work in this film is horrible; ""Cloverfield and Blair Witch"" must have been shot by the guy who did the Lord of the Rings compared to this. Really the film is so hard to follow and it even hurts your eyes sometimes trying to watch this, the editing maybe to blame here but man was it bad. The film actually cuts out at times and skips, and the picture gets interrupted, and color goes off, and sound goes down, and man this is just hard to watch. I really don't know how to explain this problem in very much detail; I guess all that kinda makes sense with a creature destroying things around you.

Don't think every thing about this film is bad though, the first 10 or 15 minutes is ok. I mean that the camera work is not horrible and the acting is some what ok up until the first attack scene. And the stuff I mentioned above about all the stuff with the camera work and the picture, color, and sound and stuff while it is extremely annoying may also be ingenious. Don't get it wrong I absolutely hate that stuff and that stuff made me dislike the film, but it also helped the company out a lot. Think about that for a second, because they did that stuff a certain times they could hide the budget better. No good shots of the creature because the picture went out, reasonable because some cameras may act like that and they didn't have to spend money on creature shots. Now that does not excuse this film from being what it is, but it does make sense from a business stand point.

I think that this is probably one of if not the worst movies I have ever watched; honestly it should never have been made. I' am starting to think I made a bad decision in purchasing this, what do you think?",1221609600,3,3990,4.265521796565389

3271044,1,B000YV2EFE,"Speaking of rubbish, that Blair Witch idea has a lot to answer for! Shaky, supposedly 'real' home movie footage of events which is then passed off as fact, is so pass now, I can't believe people are still attempting to pull this off, especially when the result is as dire as this one! I don't believe I have ever given just one star to any movie as I always try to see the positive in most things and try not to say anything at all if I can't say something nice, but I feel I must make an exception for this.
I imagine it's a low budget copy of the idea behind ""Cloverfield"" (though I haven't seen that yet) and is so poorly done and so dismal I'm amazed it ever got given a dvd release.
The two women who are whom the 'story' is based around are so obviously acting and aware of it and so fake and uninteresting in every way that it was extremely tedious trying to stick this out 'til the end. That, coupled with the shaky, dodgy camerawork, no doubt deliberately dodgy in attempts to cover up the fact that nothing much was actually happening and they couldn't afford much in the way of effects, so the frequent black screen, pixelated picture, almost constant lines of interference, and other assorted unwatchable attempts used to convey a supposedly real filming of events, was all done to mask what really was being filmed, namely just normal life in a normal street scene in any big city, in this case, Tokyo, and if they thought that making the picture barely watchable was meant to be convincing that the events really were taking place and they were running for their lives, hence dodgy picture from shaky hand held camera, then they must think that anyone watching must be stupid. And, seeing as I sat through this endurance test for one and a half hours, I'm thinking that I must be!
If the events had been real, then the person doing the filming would have filmed events other than a bit of smoke coming from buildings and a fake looking octopus type monster waving its tentacles around, but the sister doing the filming, (though they took turns) preferred to focus mainly on her sister instead of the supposed exciting events taking place all around them! Again, obviously this was to cover up the lack of budget, if not it was extremely pretentious but ultimately naive attempts at making events look 'real'. If so, they didn't pull it off. There wasn't even anyone in it worth feasting your eyes on to make it more worthwhile from an eye candy point of view. There were a couple of cute young Japanese guys, one we saw briefly before he got killed in the back of a van they sheltered in, and another one in a light grey hoody, who we saw even less of but who did look really cute, so even more black marks to the filmmakers who could at least have made this dire effort more watchable by getting some decent close ups of these cute guys, but no, even that opportunity was passed over in favour of pretentious nonsense. It was only one pound in a discount shop, but even so, I still feel like I should ask for my money back! At least I can have a good old moan about it here on Amazon and warn others about how bad it is!

I got fooled by the picture on the cover of the dvd, showing giant tentacles encircling a tower building, but you don't get to see that anywhere in the movie, it's obviously just cover art that they've used to try and make it look as though it's a scene from the movie. It certainly isn't! It is on the cover to make you think you'll see it in the film, so don't be fooled by that if you see the dvd lurking in some discount store, even if it's only a penny, it's not worth it, it isn't even good in a bad way, not even funny, it's just awful.",1214179200,4,3680,4.302593659942363

One is apparently concerned with different species of animals, running, it appears, 30 minutes, the other, the film whose cover is shown and identification made in the Titles, a feature length film about disaster in Tokyo related to some barely seen  monster. The latter I will take as the referent for the review.
I did not think it terrible as so many reviewers have written. If you accept the sub-genre within which the movie is concerned, the pseudo-documentary, it is pretty good. Something, best guess for most of the length of the ""film"", would have appeared an air attack by an enemy force, is attacking Tokyo  and, in return, the Japanese Air Force is defending with the full panoply of modern weapons. The result seems to be the destruction of many of Tokyo's buildings with constant danger from the concussion-induced cave-ins and other damage due to the enemy and friendly forces fire. Two sisters are in Tokyo to film a documentary on Global Warning; they are caught in the cross-fire as they seek for one of the buildings housing  American officials. The camera catches explanations by one of the sisters, as well as interaction with Japanese people, and fragments as the camera is twisted, jiggled  and banged up.  The ending I should not discuss in detail, but it is similar to the first of  the pseudo-documentaries (in which three college students are out to capture scenes relevant to a study of witches and other supernatural phenomena in Western Maryland).

Constant shut-offs, LOOOOONG black spots (I'm not talking plot holes, I'm talking just blank, dead screen; a few times I thought my TV had shut itself off in protest), pixelation issues at ""crucial"" times add to the disjointed annoyance. My CELL PHONE has a better camera.  One scene even has a tentacle going up into the air, and the screen pixelates... but amazingly ONLY the tentacle does.

The two ""leads"" (I'll call them that since they're in front of the camera, and calling them Golems is impolite) are so annoying and ditzy, you ROOT for the vague tentacled monster to chow down on them (they're acting is so bad, it has to be lethal). Much of the film is spent with them running up to people saying ""we're Americans"".  Perhaps in Moscow, Paris, or Tel Aviv during a disaster you might need to do that, but in Tokyo, it's pretty darn CLEAR that they're not locals. They film each other - despite repeated announcements that they ""must cover the story"".  So instead of carnage, you get to see them drinking bottled water or crying. Did I mention they can't remember the name of their hotel? (always smart in a country where the you haven't one idea of how to read or speak the local language).

With the exceptions of a few scenes, Tokyo looks suspiciously like a slummy Californian city. One long scene has the protagonists in front of a window where the only sign NOT in English is a neon one. The ""locals"" almost all have American clothing and haircuts (yes, in Japan they DO wear American t-shirts, but 8 of 10 will have ""You Pretty Soda Refresh To Me!"" type of English).

Seriously, if you want a better film about Japan getting attacked by a monster, watch Godzilla, or one of the Gamera flicks. The Acting is better, and even with the visible wires and zippers in the rubber monster suits, you at least get to SEE the darn monsters.

8234404,1,B000YV2EFE,"Okay, first off, I am a HUGE fan of the DaiKaiju (Japanes giant monster film) genre. That said, I admit to being VERY excited to see this film. The cover art is great, and depicts a huge tentacled creature emerging from the ground to topple a skyscraper. I had high hopes for 'Cloverfield' when the project was announced, and was mildly pleased with that offering. However it still had it's weak points-mainly the annoying acting by the main character (the fellow 'filming' the live 'events'), and the short supply of good monster footage. But this review is about the new film 'Monster'--not 'Cloverfield'. In my opinion, they should have called this movie 'What Monster?'
Let us begin: the setup is that there was a 'cover-up' regarding a disastrous 7.8 'earthquake' in Japan in 2003 which killed thousands and has been exposed as 'something else' by this 'found footage' (Grrroooaaaan-not AGAIN)! But this film is actually an excersise in what NOT to do in a 'mock reality monster drama'...first, don't GREENLIGHT such a horribly written story plot by a novice writer, second, don't hire such a terrible director (getting the picture?)...third, don't hire annoyingly BAD actresses to play the main roles--these girls are SO BAD at acting realistic, they make most Soap Opera actresses look like Meryl Streep. They are supposed to be sisters-however look NOTHING alike(?). BFF's would have been more believeable at least. After a solid 10 minutes on nonsensical bullcrap, pissing and moaning about this and that, preening for the camera, etc.,etc., they finally arrive at their destination in Tokyo to film a 'global warming' documentary. A Documentary with TWO people working on it (as the Japanese Minister Of Affairs comments ""Tiny crew"", the one chick quips back ""Extremely efficient crew!"" Yeah...ummm...okay--more like 'tiny budget'). Noone bothers to explain WHY they would need to go to JAPAN to document 'global warming'--just some jibber jabber about America being the most guilty country of all regarding ruining the earth's ozone layer, and having a possible non-trade decision passed against us by Japan as a result. Script writing classes anyone? It is at this time we hear sirens passing by, and the ground suddenly begins to shake--the Minister Of Affairs quickly explains that Japan often gets such tremors due to the faultline. Then everything just falls apart. I mean the FILM-not the BUILDING. The next thing we know, the sisters are in a 'shelter' somewhere beneath the building with an American who works in Japan--yet knows very little Japanese (???)--who SOMEHOW found out there were 2 Americans hiding in this secluded 'shelter'!!! Plot holes anyone? Anyway, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this filmed on digital gem--oh wait--there AREN'T ANY!!! All we get are ANNOYING, flashing, cutting, blinking pieces of imagery...screams from the crowds of running people (whom we hardly ever see)...and the roars of the as of yet unseen titular creature. I recall looking at my counter and seeing we were over 40 minutes into the 'movie', yet we had still seen NOTHING. Nothing but bad acting galore, white noise, and headache inducing camera work. It seems the only good footage which shows the 'monster', was on 'Tape #3'-which was conveniently 'damaged beyond repair' when the films were 'found' (ala 'Blair Witch Project). This is explained when the sister filming tells the other sister (who STILL hasn't seen the monster either-but has been running from it for the last 30 minutes) to ""PLEEEASSE--just look at the TAPE if you don't believe me!"" My God-if I could have given this piece of crap LESS than one star--I would have. MINUS ZERO STARS would be my choice. BTW-to the person who gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars near the top of this page and RAVES about how incredible the film is--I realize you must be either the writer, director, or an actor in this MESS-and you had to TRY and balance out the negative reviews somehow! Please...just do us and yourself a favor and LEARN from your mistake and don't make anymore films. Okay-back to the mess. So by the ONE HOUR mark, we have seen the flicker of a tentacle or two over the top of a building--that's IT. Then we get the second 'homage' (I'm being kind) to 'Blair Witch' in which the gals decide they are going to die-so they'd better leave testimonials as to what happened to them for us and their families, and to show everyone what TRULY went down in Japan. By this point WE JUST DON'T CARE and want too see our 'MONSTER' already DAMMIT!!! Well...when we DO get to see 'it'...is it worth the wait? That depends on if you call 3rd rate CGI worthy of a regular Xbox game 'worth the wait'. Godzilla it ain't (and by Godzilla I MEAN the TRUE Toho Godzilla-not Tri-Star's failed fiasco). These FX are among the WORST of the 'Made for Sci-Fi Channel' flix-a sub genre of films I TRULY HATE. And do we see the entire creature? Nope. Just a bunch of those nifty 'tentacles' coming out of the ground. Where were the ghastly roars coming from? The thing obviously has a head-or even a MOUTH at least for God's sake! Hint to the writer and director-if you are going to try and fleece cash from Giant Monster film fans-SHOW THE DAMN MONSTER YOU FOOLS! If your 'budget' (which I'm sure was spent entirely on plane fare to Japan, and hotels/catering for the entire crew) does NOT permit you to SHOW the 'monster'--DON'T CALL YOUR MOVIE 'MONSTER'!!! Call it '2 American Chicks Running Around Japan Screaming'! Sheesh! In closing, I'd like to say that I was SO inspired by the horribleness of this viewing expierience, that I made it a POINT to write this review to save millions of Kaiju fans the wasted 90 minutes of my life which I will NEVER get back. Thank you Mr. Director. PLEASE-save your TIME as well as your money--avoid 'Monster' at all costs. Go watch the original 1954 classic 'Gojira' again...even 'Cloverfield' for that matter. Whew! I feel like going and punching something just from the bad taste this movie left in my mouth...I have to go and vomit now. Thanks for listening...",1322438400,2,6070,4.848747591522158
8234405,1,B000YV2EFE,"MONSTER is as bad as a monster film could be.  The problem is not the plot.  A tentacled creature that is never clearly shown attacks Tokyo and generally rips the city apart.  Now GODZILLA, MOTHRA, and others have a similar premise but these hold the viewer's interest even if that interest is on a dopey, juvenile, not to be taken seriously basis.  If a film is about a huge creature bent on destruction, then it is encumbent on the director to provide a rationale for its existence.  And of course, there should be a clear conflict between creature and humanity.  When the film refuses to show the scale of the creature as was done in CLOVERFIELD, the result is that the gap between audience involvement and audience boredom begins to widen. The director clearly intended to use the camera work of herky-jerky, fade in fade out and weird screen patterns to imply a sense of audience confusion about the nature of the creature but instead the constant use of such techniques degrades into a distraction.  There is no forward movement to the plot.  Two American tourists (Sarah Lynch and Erin Sullivan) fly to Tokyo to film a symposium on global warming. The director tries weakly to link global warming with the appearance of the monster but that connection is tenuous at best.  Lynch and Sullivan spend every minute of their screen time as the Lost American Tourist, with both asking every one they meet: ""Can you speak English?""  I very quickly ceased to care about their fate, and when that happens, the film falls flat.  Even though the cast were hamstrung by a near zero budget, there was no excuse for the deliberately sloppy editing.  To see how to destroy Tokyo properly view the original GODZILLA that showed how to use toy models at low cost to simulate a conflagration.  Pass on MONSTER.",1312070400,,1799,4.7092651757188495
