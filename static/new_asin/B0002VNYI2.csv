2127344,2,B0002VNYI2,"It's cost effective, yes. But Looney vol. 2 Spotlight Collection is in actuality - discs 3 and 4 of the Gold Set without any of the extras. There is a short feature on disc 1 on how to draw the characters and a short on disc 2 where you animate some musical number...In essence - there are a LOT of Tweety cartoons and then a hodge podge of Bugs and Elmer etc....Disc 1 of the 4 set has Bugs cartoons and Disc 2 is mainly Road Runner, so if you aren't a huge fan of those then the 2 disc set could be the way to go. One plus is that What's Opera Doc and One Froggy Evening are included...",1099353600,61,588,3.908333333333333

In a 2-disc collection, I instead found anywhere from 3-5 Sylvester/Tweety Bird, Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and Daffy Duck.  I was disappointed with the selection.

This is great entertainment, well written, and the illustration is superb. Many criticized these cartoons to have too much violence so the broadcast cartoons became edited to suit the critics.

2127436,1,B0002VNYI2,"I just posted this ""note"" on my Facebook page.  If I could rate this with zero stars, you bet your rear I would.

I am going to try and put this as delicately as possible as I am extremely outraged!  I bought my two-year-old daughter the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection, Volume Two (2), two disc DVD set for Christmas because I grew up loving Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, as I am guessing a lot of us did.  We put it in and were watching it today as we were cleaning her room.  I was not really paying attention to it as I was trying to organize all of her new toys from Christmas.  I did, however, notice that Porky Pig was on with someone who resembled Uncle Sam and they were talking about the history of the United States of America and how it came to be.  There was a George Washington character and a Patrick Henry (""Give me liberty or give me death!"") character as well as a few others that I did not pay attention to.  Tuning into it a bit more, I noticed that Porky Pig was saying the Pledge of Allegiance as the flag of the United States of America was being raised up a pole.  I thought it was very nice, until I heard something, or, rather did not hear something, extremely important.  As ""Mr. Pig"" was saying the Pledge of Allegiance, he omitted ""under God"".  I kid you not.  I thought maybe I just missed it, so I rewound it and listened, from the beginning of the Pledge of Allegiance, again.  Sure enough, I heard ""...and to the Republic, for which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.""  Absolutely no mention of God!  Now, see why I am outraged!  If I can figure out how to do it, I plan on attaching a picture of the DVD that I purchased, although I am not 100% sure of where the case to the DVD is, to this ""note"".  I ""Googled"" the DVD I have and this link to www.amazon.com came up.  http://www.amazon.com/Looney-Tunes-Spotlight-Collection-Vol/dp/B0002VNYI2.

I got this off of www.amazon.com. This is the cover of the DVD.

I did just ""like"" a couple different Warner Brothers pages here on Facebook in hopes of being able to tag them in this note and it would show up on their page.  If that does not work, I will ""dislike"" them immediately.

After everything our country has been through, we have always remained one Nation, UNDER GOD and God help us if someone decides that is not the way it should continue because someone may get offended.  This is ONE NATION, UNDER GOD!

This is the actual DVD we were watching.

UPDATE::::::::

UPDATE:  My father-in-law just pointed something out to me.  Apparently, the original verision of the Pledge of Allegiance did not have the words ""under God"" in it and said ""I did a little search and one person said it was put in the pledge in 1954 which sounds right to me. The Knights of Columbus were the biggest lobbied strongly to have it put into the pledge. Congress finally added it. So it may not be Warner Bros. fault. Looney Toons go back into WW2 at least. So before you throw them away, Charlie check some more. I do remember that as a little kid I was introduced to the new version in class. ""Under God"" was not in the original.""

Okay, so maybe it is not Warner Brothers or Looney Tunes.  Maybe that is how it was then.  I may not throw out all of the DVD's we have, but definately this one, just because I do not want her hearing or learning this version.  I will definately be listening to each movie more closely though.

I still do not blelieve that it should have been available to be purchased like this.",1324944000,,3515,4.358461538461539
2127437,1,B0002VNYI2,"Do you see the cover which clearly shows Taz, Yosimite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Foghorn Leghorn,Roadrunned and Coyote? Yeah, so did I. None of those are in there.

1st disc is mainly Tweety bird which you get tired of.

The 2nd disc is a bunch of Hollywood spoofs from the (50's 60's) which I doubt was very funny 50 years ago let alone now. I wanted to show my son some of the classic cartoons I remember as a kid.

Everything else (mostly the way-too-old B/W's from the '30's) was very much untouched. Sure, I own the first two seasons' worth of the classic B/W comedy ""I Love Lucy"" from 1951-53, but then, that was a television series that had some laughs to it. A lot of the way-too-old B/W's of the '30's didn't have much in the way of laughs, not just to me but to a lot of other people who thought that those were boring. If it were one disc of Tweety/Sylvester and one of Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote, I probably would have seen all the cartoons on both discs and would have felt that I had gotten a deal.

Well, the problem is that the ""spotlight"" comprises two discs: one mostly full of Sylvester and Tweety, whom I enjoy, but it would be nice to have some variety. The second is based on musical cartoons, a few gems you will want like ""Three Little Bops,"" and ""One Froggy Evening."" The real problem is, among many of the cartoons that aren't really ""classics,"" there are aged stereotypes and habits that you won't want your kids to see, such as obvious caricatures of African Americans and Native Americans, as well as glorification of sexist behavior and tobacco use.

I am not a supporter of the Political Correctness movement, but this just goes too far to be enjoyable, and the quality of the shorts overall is below average.

2127467,3,B0002VNYI2,"""Be Vawy Qwiet, I'm hunting Wabbits"" - Kill The Wabbit - Kill the Wabbit!!! Watching and listening to Elmer doing his opera routine is worth the price of admission especially for fans of Looney Tunes. With this DVD set, you get the best Looney Tunes cartoon of all time ""What's Opera Doc""  The downside is that What's Opera Doc is a bit out of place compared to the rest of what is offered and some of them are just not that fun at all.

This 2 DVD set includes 30 Looney collections from the 40's, 50's but mostly 60's. Disc one is 15 cartoons with 75% Sylvester VS Tweety incarnations and a bit of Porky Pig VS Daffy Duck routines. I was mildly surprised to see one of the early black and white Porky Pig episodes (Porky IN Wackyland) that mixed Live actors with the cartoon characters and has been tucked away from Warner Brothers for decades and was released in the 40's. Shows and proves you don't need modern technology to make quality entertainment.

Disc 2 is the big one, which includes the greatest Looney Tunes cartoon ever, ""What's Opera Doc"". It also includes the very entertaining ""One Froggy Evening"" which made the little ""non-speaking"" frog famous in one showing. The rest of the collection is a bag full of Hollywood and show business spoofs making fun of the famous faces in Hollywood taken from the 40's, 50's and 60's. Most are entertaining enough, but certainly lack the fun and spunk of the episodes of Elmer and Bugs going at it. The famous Warner Brothers characters are basicaly non-existent with the exception of Bugs and Elmer in What's Opera Doc. Don't expect big laughs from this 2nd rate collection that won't appeal to the kiddies as well as it should.  But be that as it may, the cartoons, for what they are, and considering how old they are, look and sound fantastic. Not up by todays standards of digital movies, but remastered very well, and they have withstood the test of time. If you like Tweety VS Sylvester and have to own ""What's Opera Doc"", you probably should load up on this Part 2 collection. Overall it's great, but some of the cartoons on here are not the best of what Warner Brothers has done in other collections.",1109462400,61,2163,4.552699228791774

For the cartoons alone, this collection deserves 4 stars, which is why I'm giving it that.  It has One Froggy Evening (featuring the singing and dancing frog- ""Hello m'baby, hello m'darling, hello m'ragtime gal!""), The Three Little Bops (featuring Shorty Rogers and comedian Stan Freberg), Stagedoor Cartoon (one of the great Elmer and Bugs chase cartoons), Show Biz Bugs (""I can only do it once!"") and What's Opera Doc (""Kill the wabbit, kill the wabbit!""), as well as the original Porky in Wackyland (""Yes, I'm really the last of the do-do's!  Dodododododododo!""), The great Piggybank Robbery (a hilarious Dick Tracy satire) and quite a few Tweety and Sylvester cartoons (All Abirrrd is hilarious with the boxed bulldog constantly punching Sylvesteron the train, as well as Gift Wrapped, one of the few Christmas cartoons WB produced, Ain't She Tweet, where Sylvester has to get across several bulldogs to get to Tweety and Tweety Pie, the 1st Sylvester/Tweety cartoon).  I have no problem with this budgetized version as long as people know that's just what it is (the only extra's you get feature drawings of Bugs, Yosemite Sam, the Road Runner and J Michigan Frog).  Now if they're going to do that, they should include a budgetized version of the Bugs Bunny DVD and the Road Runner DVD as well.  If you want it all, go buy The Golden Collection, which has all the cartoons on this one and more (plus extra's).

The second disc of this set has some really neat cartoons on it too.  I like the ""3 Little Bops"" in particular for some reason; I think it's cute.  Some of the cartoons on this set date from the late 1930s and early 1940s, with 2 that I can think of being in black and white.  One of my only gripes is that there aren't any Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales, or Yosemite Sam cartoons on this set. Those are some of my personal favorite Looney Tune characters. I hope there weren't any of those included in the new Golden Collection Volume 2, or maybe I will regret not buying that set!

2127473,3,B0002VNYI2,"I really enjoy a whole lot of classic animation that has been coming back to the mainstream recently on video. It has happened with classic cartoons like The Jetsons, The Flintstones, Wacky Races, but also the legendary animated cartoons from Warner Brothers. They truly brought out so much zaniness to peoples' live that really hasn't been seen anywhere else. The two Golden Collections that've been released since last year, have really done extraordinarily well. Unfortunately, even though they are good, they have made a pair of lackluster, cheaper collections that really are more for people on budgets that really acn't afford the bigger, better golden collections.

The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collections: 1 & 2, is a compilation from over 50 classic Warner Brother cartoons. The animation on these collections have been remastered well, and include some remarkable cartoons that feature classic characters including Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck and Tweety & Sylvester. The collection includes cartoons like The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, the spin off of Friz Freleng's Rhapsody Rabbit Baton Bunny, A Broken Leghorn with Foghorn Leghorn, and the legendary Chuck Jones masterpiece What's Opera Doc? The animation and the clips about these cartoons fair very well, and have been remastered well, but doesn't really measure up to the feel of the Golden Collections.

The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection: 1 & 2 is fair, but doesn't compare to the two-pack of the two Looney Tunes Golden Collection editions that Warner Brothers released. I honestly don't suggest this Spotlight Collection double pack, unless you really aren't interested in all of the first two discs from both Golden Collections.

2127474,3,B0002VNYI2,"When Warner Brothers considered releasing the Looney Tunes on DVD, it was such a amazing ordeal. Many people have rediscovered the crazy and wonderful cartoons that Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and company have starred in back during the Golden era of animation. Unfortunately, when Warner Brothers released the Looney Tunes Golden collection, they also released a lesser-valued Premire cCollection. It really wasn't worth its weight in the money, and its sequel also heads that exact same way. The same is said for the Looney Tunes Premiere Collection sequel, which also wasn't worth its weight in money, or DVD collections either.

The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection: Volume 2, is actually the second half of the Golden Collection: Volume Two. The 2 DVD's have a lot of good cartoons on them. The first one focuses in on primarily Tweety & Sylvester, with wacky and exciting cartoons like Bad Ol' Putty Tat, and the Oscar-winning introduction to Tweety & Sylvester, Tweetie Pie which Friz Freleng directed. The rest of the cartoons pay respect to director Bob Clampett, with some great creative cartoons that really pushed the boundaries including The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, and Porky In Wackyland.

Disc 2, is a tribute to toons on stage & screen, with wild animated cartoons including some rearkable masterpieces like What's Opera Doc?, Show Biz Bugs, and the ultimate one-toon wonder Michigan J. Frog in One Froggy Evening.

Although The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volume 2 has a lot of good cartoons, it really isn't worth the money. I honestly suggest the more fulfilled Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume Two. It is more worth its money than this collection really is.
