5053384,4,B007387QAY,"The best of the CT releases are the ones that come fro live shows. The studio releases, while good, don't have nearly the amount of energy the live DVDs have. This is a great Eddie Romero movie (also known as Brides of Blood) for riffing because it's hilarious in its own right. If you start laughing at what you see without the jokes, you know what I mean. The original MST three plus Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl only heighten the hilarity a little more.

I am doubting we'll see many more releases from Cinematic Titanic now that the entertainment writers strike is long over. The last two most recent releases (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinematic-Titanic-Live-War-of-the-Insects/dp/B006PW6AGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinematic Titanic Live: War of the Insects</a>&nbsp;and The Rattlers( aren't even in print. Neither are several other CT releases (Blood of Vampires, Alien Factor, Frankenstein's House of Freaks).

Save for only a few final live shows in 2013, Cinematic Titanic seems poised to disband and go their own way. Enjoy whats available to buy now while its available.",1373587200,,1131,5.531791907514451
5053385,4,B007387QAY,"Well, I was a MST3K fan. I still watch it all the time. I gave Riff Trax a chance, they were putting out a new episode too often that was poorly thought out. Loved Jaws though, anyway. I was worried with this being my first Cinematic Titanic purchase that I wouldn't like it. The format was funny and it worked really well with an audience. I try to look on here for reviews so I can see the best ones. Sadly I don't have the money to buy them all. I wish instead of coming out with 4 million DVDs they would release a few a year that were well scripted and thought out. So far with Cinematic Titanic, thats what I've seen. I want to find ""Rattlers"" but its out of stock on Amazon. I will find it... I will buy it... and it will be mine.",1363132800,,737,3.9864864864864864
5053386,5,B007387QAY,"This one is sooooo funny! it is a hilariously bad movie and CT chops it up and serves it with style. The crew works great together, and it is also fun to hear the audiences response. What a party! The DVD makes me feel like I was there too!",1359676800,,240,3.9183673469387754
5053387,5,B007387QAY,"1st. Do not buy this 50 dollar copy, buy yours directly from the makers of this video (the humorists on stage) for much less money:[...]  For 15.00 bucks plus shipping.

2nd. They are much funnier than the Joel era MST3K - they're all grown up and doing it for adult audiences - though, not really rude at all.

3rd. They have around ten products now and all of them are worth the modest fee!

While MST3K seems to have rent down the middle, the two crews -- Cinematic Titanic, and Rifftrax provide DOUBLE the entertainment value!",1303171200,11,530,4.489583333333333
5053388,5,B007387QAY,"""Cinematic Titanic"" is the heir to the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" movie mocking dynasty and features the brilliant antics of former MST3K cast members Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, and J. Elvis Weinstein, in this case live. ""Danger on Tiki Island"" is an absolutely wonderful example of their craft with great riffs, a ridiculous movie, and the added bonus of an audience howling with laughter.

The film was made in the Philippines and is a confusing tale of a mysterious island near the Bikini atoll which was irradiated during atomic bomb tests, and the strange inhabitants who call it home. It centers on the exploits of three Peace Corps volunteers Dr. Paul Henderson (Kent Taylor,) a stuffy scientist with a justifiable aversion to his wife, Carla Henderson (Beverly Hills...no, really...that's the stage name Beverly Powers chose) as his horrid nymphomaniacal wife, and Jim Farrell (John Ashley) as the do-gooder nice guy and hero.

They arrive by boat just as a funeral is taking place for two horribly mauled women. Shortly we discover from native leader Arcadio (Andres Centenera) that they have reverted to their primitive ways. There's some backstory about virgin sacrifices and radiation-related mutations before we meet suave Esteban Powers (Mario Montenegro) who lives in a big weird house with his devoted but creepy assistant Goro (Bruno Punzalan) and a bunch of dwarves. The whole thing is bordering on the surreal, and crosses that line when we meet the screaming prehensile trees and learn that Powers is himself a hideous (but hilarious) mutant on the warpath. Speaking of surreal, whatever you do be sure not to miss the vicious moth attack! There's also lots of silly scenery chewing, some chanting that is really hard to get out of your mind, some man-to-man and man-to-tree combat, and an absolute ton of laughs.

I was unsure if the live audience would help or hurt the production, but I really liked hearing the audience's spontaneous laughter at the ridiculous screen action and wonderful comments from the five veteran riffers. The film is a great choice for them and I couldn't have been more amused by it. I think it's the best ""Cinematic Titanic"" episode yet, and the behind the scenes ""Between the Riffs"" mini-documentary is both enlightening and entertaining. I can't recommend the ""Cinematic Titanic"" version of ""Danger on Tiki Island"" highly enough!",1287446400,13,2417,5.113924050632911

8509166,5,B007387QAY,The live versions of these are the best because you get to see and hear them interact with a live audience. If you're an MST fan you have to get these live versions for not only the reason I noted above but the jokes are fresher and faster. Truely awesome and wish they were still doing these.,1429401600,,293,4.157894736842105
8509167,5,B007387QAY,This was terrific! Very funny. The riffing was top notch and the movie was pretty darn good too!,1409097600,,96,4.388888888888889
8509168,4,B007387QAY,"A silly movie made much funnier with the comments from the original crew of Mystery Science Theater. The movie was filmed in the Philippines with mostly Philippine actor extras but with a few recognizable American actors. The blond was the first to be eaten in the original Jaws movie.

Don't walk through the forest at night. The trees WILL try to grab you. Don't sleep too soundly. The beautiful horny blond WILL try to grab you. Funny ludicrous stuff.",1409011200,,454,4.746835443037975

8509170,5,B007387QAY,"This is the original MST 3000 group, and the movie is silly, but really funny.  My family loves the original crew from MST 3000.",1402876800,,128,4.333333333333333
8509171,5,B007387QAY,"As one reviewer pointed out, lots of the early MST3K jokes referenced pop-culture bits salient for an audience born in the 60's.....so for the young'uns, most of those jokes are dated nowadays. The particular episode features a WRETCHED movie, so ripe for riff'ing!  This is a great work of comedy!! Buy this today!",1397174400,,315,4.943396226415095
8509172,2,B007387QAY,"It doesn't help that the movie itself is hard to watch. But the jokes aren't that great either. Overall it's pretty boring. In fact, it put my wife to sleep. Might be the worst Cinematic Titanic I've seen yet.",1391817600,,209,4.384615384615385
8509173,4,B007387QAY,Danger on Tiki Island enjoyable fun from the mst crew. I enjoy CT better than rifftrax and will recommend this movie to others,1388188800,,126,4.521739130434782
8509174,5,B007387QAY,"I love this Cinematic Titanic movie.  I belive I have all of them, and this one is my favorite.  If you like MST3K, you'll love this.  In fact, the MST3K jokes are getting quite dated now, but the references in this series are much more up-to-date, and will probably even make sense to your kids!  (if you can get them to put that smartphone down long enough to watch it with you)",1377734400,4,380,4.236111111111111
