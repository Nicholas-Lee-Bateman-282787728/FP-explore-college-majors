8482804,1,B005Q0FO4Q,"Very poorly done, badly produced, disorganized, no theme. But the real joke was to call places like Venice and Venice Beach ""hidden Los Angeles,"" they are well known to anyone who knows anything about Los Angeles. The narrator got stuck in long pointless interviews with anyone he ran into (the Romanian on the pier was a special waste)....this could have been an interesting video, as there are many hidden places in Los Angeles that are really interesting (old film sites, historical sites, and so on). Don't waste your money on this.",1453852800,,536,4.9010989010989015
8482805,4,B005Q0FO4Q,"Overall, it was entertaining.  Not a deep study of LA but gives the flavor of different areas.  It is a travologue not a true history and that is fine.",1374105600,,151,4.172413793103448
8482806,1,B005Q0FO4Q,"By the description, I thought this DVD was going to be full of lots of hidden places to visit while in Los Angeles.
The Marina Del Ray area was only briefly discussed, however, the Venice bridges were covered in detail. But that
was it.  The length of the ""Hidden Los Angeles"" portion was only around 20 minutes.  Most of what was
covered were restaurants where the host and his girlfriend liked to eat.  Video quality was very poor.  As an avid traveler, I was extremely disappointed and have gotten more information from researching the internet.  I cannot recommend this DVD.",1365811200,4,578,4.74
