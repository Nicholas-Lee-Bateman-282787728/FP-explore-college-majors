7894549,5,6305723753,"This is a lovely movie, great acting, in Buenos Aires, of a very lonely, scared woman who allows herself to accept caring and eventually love from a man who goes along with her crazy, disfunctional scheme. I cared about them both and watched it over and over. This is a great movie.",1328400000,,282,4.4423076923076925
7894550,1,6305723753,"The remarkable artistry in character development has been robbed from viewers of this movie by what is absolutely the worst DVD quality I have ever seen. It looks as though it has been created from a poor VHS copy, with the line structure actually encoded onto the DVD. Whatever I write will not prepare you for the visual horror that awaits the hapless buyer.",998006400,11,360,4.640625
