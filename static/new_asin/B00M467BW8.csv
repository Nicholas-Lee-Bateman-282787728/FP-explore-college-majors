8670165,5,B00M467BW8,"Testosterone, impaired thinking and physics create the annual Isle of Man TT race.  It is UNBELIEVABLE to see these chaps blowing around this little island on city streets and country roads at speeds approaching 200 mph.  You will love this DVD - buy it right now.",1428105600,,264,4.717391304347826

8670167,5,B00M467BW8,"Unfortunately, AFAIK, this is the only way to see any part of the TT in the United States nowadays.  Very well put together (consolidating a week's worth of practice, qualifying, and racing into 4 hours and make coherent is no easy task, I'm sure).

I pick this up every September to get the current year's TT race highlights.",1427155200,3,326,4.603448275862069
