8011253,5,B0001EFS0M,"Bought this for a Christmas present so have not yet viewed it and cannot comment on the quality of the product itself.  However, the seller sent the item promptly and in good order so no complaints there.",1289088000,,204,4.513513513513513
8011254,5,B0001EFS0M,This one of Stan & Ollie's earlier feature films and it is great! It moves at a very good pace and it isn't padded to stretch it out. The boys are in almost every scene. Their looking for the grandparents of their best friend [who was captured by the germans in WW1 and presumed killed]. Their misadventures of trying to find Mr. & Mrs. smith is hilarious! This is a must have for all Laurel & Hardy fans.,1280275200,,405,4.205128205128205
8011255,4,B0001EFS0M,"Fully restored to its original 68-minute length, Laurel and Hardy's second starring feature holds up surprisingly well. ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" (1932) remains among the team's most enjoyable efforts, with several classic routines and an excellent supporting cast.  Stan and Ollie are a pleasure to watch in this offbeat World War I comedy-drama. Look for a cameo by director George Marshall as the vengeful cook.",1209513600,10,412,5.338461538461538
8011256,4,B0001EFS0M,"It's kinda pointless to review Laurel and Hardy, except to say that this is my favorite of all their features.

So, I'll review the disc. This is made by a small company, so it is on a DVD-R, but it is the only way you can get this movie on a DVD made for North America! (Foreign DVDs play at the wrong speed.) The film print they used is a good one, and it's a nice transfer to digital. Plus, the sound is full and rich. No need to shy away just because it's a small company that made it! This is worth it.",1202256000,8,507,3.875
8011257,4,B0001EFS0M,"Laurel & Hardy's second film effort is a pleasing follow-up to ""Pardon Us"". Here, at the height of their success, Stan & Ollie bumble their way through WWI, then take custody of their war buddy's little girl after he's killed on the battle field.
In all honesty, while this is a better constructed film than ""Pardon Us"", it's not quite as funny. Stan & Ollie have had better opportunities than this (""Sons of the Desert"" and ""Way Out West"" come to mind) to display their humor. PUYT feels like two films stitched together, with not enough time devoted for either story.
However, no Laurel & Hardy movie is completely without its amusing moments: Stan crossing his eyes and then panicking when they won't uncross; their accidental capturing of the enemy (with Oliver's ample bottom half sticking out of a tank); and a charming, irresistible moment where the little girl reads a fairy tale to a napping Stan.
Although not THE best L&H fare, it's still enjoyable and worth watching.",1187049600,8,979,4.798816568047338
8011258,5,B0001EFS0M,"""Pack Up Your Troubles"" presents Laurel and Hardy in their prime, with fresh gags and a great uncredited supporting role from Director George Marshall, as the cook. This, their second feature, is an improvement over their first. The scene where the little girl tells Stan the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears as he falls asleep is alone worth the price of this DVD.
This is obviously a restored and complete print. There are scenes I had never seen before, and the picture quality is exceptionally clear and crisp. Contrast is excellent, and detail is sharp.  If you are a Laurel and Hardy fan, you must own this rarely seen film. You will not be disappointed, as I have been with some of the recent L&H reissues. This one is a winner!!",1136678400,34,743,4.586466165413534
