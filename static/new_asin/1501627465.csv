8323725,4,1501627465,"Hate Crimes in the Heartland is a documentary that portrays the violence rooted in Americas history of racial hatred by focusing on Tulsa, Oklahoma, where two hate crimes over 90 years apart are impacting human rights, education and communities today. The film is an analysis of current and past hate crimes in our country.

The film begins in Tulsa, where, in 2012, two white males drove through the African-American neighborhood of Greenwood targeting black people at random, killing three and badly wounding two others. Filmmaker Rachel Lyon traces the events surrounding the murders, the social media outcry, the hunt for the killers, and the capture of two suspects who were charged with first-degree murder and faced the death penalty.

The contemporary hate crime is then compared to the 1921 Tulsa race riot in which an armed white mob attacked and burned down the same Greenwood neighborhood, known at the time as Black Wall Street because it was considered Americas wealthiest black community. The riots were instigated by a lynch mob enraged by false reports of a white womans rape by a young black man. The lynching never happened. Instead, the blood-thirsty mob turned their anger toward the thriving black community and the violence rapidly escalated into a massacre of any black people the white rioters could find. Greenwood was left in ruins; 500 businesses and 1,500 homes were destroyed. Survivors either fled the town or were put into internment centers run by the National Guard.

Both stories are compelling, but the account of the 1921 riot is especially interesting because it isn't well known, perhaps because blacks of the period were terrified of copycat incidents and so remained silent for generations. The local white population, shamed by the violence and destruction in their city, also avoided mentioning it.

Talking heads, archive footage, and interviews with those associated with both events contribute insights into the deep-seated fears and mistrust that led to such extreme action. The various interpretations of the term hate crime are outlined and racial profiling in media coverage is addressed.

Poverty Law Center could be duplicated here; they are eager to get quality educational materials in educators' hands. My school's resources are constantly cut by our state (Indiana) and with retirement in close view, I have other priorities for that type of $$.",1436054400,,448,4.8311688311688314
