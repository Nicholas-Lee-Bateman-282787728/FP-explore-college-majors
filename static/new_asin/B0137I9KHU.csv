8727051,3,B0137I9KHU,"This is a strange little comedy.  The mix of four top stars is what saves the film, but like some other comedies of the era it tries to switch from smart humor to slapstick instead of staying in one lane.  The real highlight of the film is Van Heflin in an early role as a neurotic cad after Russell who is Ameche's wife.  Russell is obsessed with making her husband jealous despite his writing a book on modern marriage getting past jealousy.  Francis is good in a later role for her as the fourth wheel in the love rectangle.  This was a borderline 4 star movie if not for some very out of place and silly slapstick in the later part of the movie.  While I love Rosalind Russell, her role might have been better suited to a glamour girl like Hedy Lamarr since they play up how unbelievably attractive the character is early in the film and the part didn't call for deep emotional acting.  Worth a watch if you like any of the stars, but most of all for Van Heflin.",1447113600,2,966,4.245901639344262
