8568813,5,B00BI3XYWE,"The movie ""Django"" includes both the English voice dub, as well as the original Italian dub complete with English subtitles.  Well worth the purchase for that alone, as I found ""Django"" to be a much more enjoyable movie with a more direct translation on the Italian version!  All four movies are in very good quality, and the packaging is very nice, keeping the DVDs safe.  Blue Underground can't be beat!",1437264000,4,405,4.757142857142857
8568814,5,B00BI3XYWE,Lotsa red sauce spread all over the walls. There is no western like spaghetti western. You clearly know who is the good and the bad guy!,1393545600,2,136,4.269230769230769
8568815,5,B00BI3XYWE,"I noticed no one had commented on this package so thought I'd write a very brief synopsis for those who were curious about it.  Blue Underground has previously released each one of the films contained here in nice looking wide-screen re-mastered formats, in individual cases.  1. DJANGO, 2. TEXAS ADIOS (1966), 3. DJANGO KILL...IF YOU LIVE SHOOT (1967), & KEOMA (1976). Three out of four of the films star Franco Nero and each represents a good cross section of Euro-Western styles which range from it's peak years to later as its popularity began to end. Some of these discs include extras like a Franco Nero interview on the DJANGO (1966) disc and director commentary on The KEOMA DVD. Accurate reviews of these individual BLUE UNDERGROUND discs can be found elsewhere on Amazon, so I won't go into to that here.  My main point is that in this package, SPAGHETTI WESTERNS UNCHAINED you get those same discs that were released individually. Same films, Same picture quality, same disc artwork, same, same, same!.  Each film is on it's own disc and all four are contained in one hard shell case. Unless you have to own an original case with artwork for each disc, this is the absolute best deal ever and the best way to obtain these classic films.  I've seen other cheap Spaghetti Western packages using a similar ""WESTERN UNCHAINED"" title so be aware.  The BLUE UNDERGROUND 4-disc package, SPAGHETTI WESTERNS UNCHAINED is the one to get.  I rate it 5 out of 5 bullets.  Such a bargain for such a quality product.",1390262400,14,1513,4.748091603053435
