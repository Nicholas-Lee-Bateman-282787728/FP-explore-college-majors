8017832,4,B0001XED90,"Based on Boris Akunin's novel 'Azazel' (English title 'The Winter Queen') set in Moscow in 1876. Boris Akunin is the pen name of Grigory Chkhartishvili, who was born in the republic of Georgia in 1956; he is a philologist, critic, essayist, and translator from Japanese. I recently read and enjoyed ""The Temple of the Golden Pavilion"" by Yukio Mishima translated by Chkhartishvili.

Chkhartishvili published his first detective stories (using the pen name Boris Akunin) in 1998 and in a very short time has become one of the most widely read authors in Russia. He has written nine Erast Fandorin novels to date, and he is working on two other series as well. Akunin enjoys almost legendary popularity in Russia. I am an avid fan of all three Akunin's series: about Erast Fandorin; about the Nun - PI Pelagiya (three books), and the newest one - about Nicolas Fandorin, the grandson of Erast.

In 'Azazel', the first and IMO, the best in Erast Fandorin series, a young police officer - Erast Fandorin - works on his first case - an odd suicide of a rich young man which leads Fandorin to the global and very dangerous conspiracy.

The film is an interesting and very enjoyable adaptation of an excellent book. The script was written by Akunin himself and adapts very well to the screen. The film was made in Nikita Mikhalkov's Studio by Mikhalkov's long time collaborator Aleksandr Adabashyan. Visually, ""Azazel"" is absolute delight, literally letting the images of Old Moscow become one of the film's main characters and attractions. The acting was good (Marina Neelova as Lady Ester was excellent; and the rest of cast all seemed to enjoy working in this project).",1154995200,2,1665,4.876325088339223
8017833,5,B0001XED90,"This is an absolutely splendid transference from book to screen of the first book by Boris Akunin (The Winter Queen). The period is meticulously and lovingly set; the costumes are perfect; the camera work is extremely good; the story itself is exciting and strongly character-driven; and the actors simply could not be bettered.

In particular, Fandorin himself was so miraculously portrayed that I felt the director had looked into my mind to find precisely how I had envisaged the character. His charm, innocence, intelligence and sheer good luck are faultlessly combined in an intricate character who is unlike any other hero you may have encountered. There is a quality of sweetness about Fandorin, rare indeed in investigators.

I speak very little Russian, so I can't pretend to understand every word of this DVD. However, I know the story well, and I did not feel at a loss while watching this. It's certainly spurred me to improve my Russian!

If you are willing to take on the difficulties of watching an un-subtitled film, I think you will find it extremly rewarding. This is simply one of the most delightful, charming and ultimately moving films to come from Russia.

Wonderful! (I won't even deduct a star for the lack of subtitles.)",1148947200,5,1246,4.947368421052632
