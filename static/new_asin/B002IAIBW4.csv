8394340,1,B002IAIBW4,"The Horsemen was directed by Jonas ckerlund and stars Dennis Quaid and Ziyi Zhang. It had a very limited release(in only 5 cities) and quickly disappeared to DVD. It was the first and hopefully last movie ever directed by Ackerland whose background consists of directing music videos.

The plot of Horsemen borders on the preposterous. A small group of nut cases begin killing people for reasons that defy logic.

I rented this movie because I am a fan of ZZ and wanted to see her in a Hollywood movie. My guess, she regrets having gotten into this worthless project.",1315180800,3,567,4.717171717171717
