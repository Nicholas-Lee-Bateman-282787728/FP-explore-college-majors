4841851,1,B005N0L9K2,"As a high school English teacher, I was hoping for a video that augmented the story.  My students really enjoy so many elements of ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" and reading it generates great discussion.  I took a risk and bought the video without seeing it, and that was a mistake.  It's quite limited in capturing Gilman's tone and setting and characterization.  The wallpaper, which is a significant symbol, doesn't even come close to matching the story's description.  There is so little of Gilman's rich imagery portrayed.",1319673600,13,520,5.070588235294117
4841852,5,B005N0L9K2,"While not easy to watch, this intense, passionate and theatrical work sears with its deep and deeper rabbit-hole journey following a young woman of the late 1800s into madness. The direction by Kevin Purcell and David Cain adds detail to an already arresting preformance. I recommend this DVD especially for anyone that has been themselves or knows someone that has been burdened with Mental Illness.",1318118400,2,400,5.1692307692307695
4841853,5,B005N0L9K2,"This performance of a narrative written over 100 years ago is a period reflection of how madness - post partum depression? schizophrenia? -- was handled before the 20th century. The exquisite acting brings the observer into the character's world....inducing discomfort, a need to escape, even pity...but is relentless. I was deeply moved by the rawness of the experience. A must-see for health care professionals and students, to better understand the historical (hysterical?) roots of mental health treatment.",1318118400,2,510,5.636363636363637
4841854,5,B005N0L9K2,"A one-woman show, as this story unfolds, it draws you in - she draws you in to her fantastic nightmare world.  The character, confined to her bedroom for most of the performance, starts out as a questionable witness and appears to be increasingly mad as her narrative goes on.

This dvd of The Yellow Wallpaper has much of the feel of being at a live performance.  The actress, Aasne Vigesaa, is wonderful to watch.  It is an intense, compelling performance.

I cared about the woman, was drawn in and empathized with her.  It has come back to my mind like a remembered experience.

I recommend this dvd.",1317945600,2,604,4.588785046728972
4841855,5,B005N0L9K2,"As a fan of the original material, I was blown away by the skill, passion and compassion which is brought to this dramatization. There is an powerful engine driving the whole piece and is likely at any moment to veer off the road, over a cliff, into a tree... The claustrophobia is palpable and incredibly uncomfortable in the best way. I would absolutely recommend this moving and harsh examination of a caged soul finding escape in strange places. The actress is phenomenal.",1317859200,2,476,4.817073170731708

8480059,1,B005N0L9K2,"This is basically a reading of the short story. There is absolutely nothing going on. I love the short story, and I really enjoy reading it with my high school students, but this was just terrible.",1450224000,,197,4.5
8480060,4,B005N0L9K2,Great movie! I was a little sceptical of this version based off my favorite story by Charlotte Perkins because no film version could touch the short story. This was a mysterious edge of your seat way of delivery.,1444262400,,212,4.605263157894737

8480062,4,B005N0L9K2,"Wow! Talk about character development! This film is a staple for groups who deal with women's issues. One woman's decent into madness, is painful to see. The acting is very very good and the story moves at a slow but well developed pace",1405296000,,236,4.511627906976744
8480063,2,B005N0L9K2,A very interesting story poorly delivered. It is just the text being vividly read while on screen. They didn't even make the effort of putting the woman in a yellow room; it is VERY pink. She never leaves the room (at least in the 2/3 I've watched thus far) and the room doesn't have the panoramic view as described. I hope to watch the rest but don't know if it will be worth it; overall waste of money.,1400025600,,404,4.1923076923076925
8480064,5,B005N0L9K2,A compelling performance that vividly portrayed an inexorable slide into madness.  A haunting portrayal of the true story of one woman's descent into the shadowy nightmare of mental illness.  My heart was pounding at the end.,1366761600,,225,5.222222222222222
8480065,1,B005N0L9K2,"I was severely disappointed in this portrayal of Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper"". I teach literature and was looking for a piece that dramatized the story - this wasn't it. It is a one woman show, with the text recited word for word as a monologue. The version that I was shown in class (as a student) was by BBC and much more appropriate as well as appealing. I looked into purchasing that but only found it for a price outside of my budget. I settled for this, and yes it was settling. My students were beyond bored and asked not to continue watching it in class. For those who have never read the story, perhaps this version would be a suggestion.
SUGGESTED VERSION FROM BBC: [...]",1330473600,4,684,4.436507936507937
8480066,2,B005N0L9K2,"If you want to see or show your students a version of the yellow wallaper where an actress recites Gilman's text pretty much word for word, this will be fantastic. I teach Literature, and I was hoping to show this as a supplement in my class. But since my students have already read the short story, I don't see the point of showing this film because it doesn't add anything cinematic (it is a sparse one-person performance, more like a filmed monologue).  I can imagine the only people who wouldn't be bored watching it for 45 minutes are those who have never read the stort story. The actress is good, but heightened and very theatrical, even at the very beginning -- in my opinion, this performative choice takes away from her character's gradual descent into madness, as well as any ambiguity in Gilman's short story. If you or your students don't like to read, though, this film may be a great alternative. Unlike in most film adaptations, you will hear the author's original wording, unabridged, with nothing new added. In other words, it is quite good for what it is -- but be aware of what it is: a dramatized reading as a substitute for reading the story yourself. What it ISN'T is a cinematic exploration of the possibilities of Gilman's intriguing text, full of visual richness, ambiguity, possibilities of the supernatural, or any other characters besides the narrator.",1330041600,14,1381,4.7782426778242675
