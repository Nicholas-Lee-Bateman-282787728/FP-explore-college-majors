7973637,5,B0000714K1,it's exactly what i expected. the only problem is the format of the dvd will only allow me to play it on my computer.,1440892800,,117,3.9166666666666665
7973638,4,B0000714K1,"I'm a new fan!  I stumbled on a youtube video of Lara singing Je T'aime - or more accurately, the audience was singing her song back to her! The clip was amazing!  After some research I discovered this DVD was the live concert from which that clip was taken - and I HAD TO HAVE IT!  The DVD is not Region 1 (US) compatible, so it doesn't work on my DVD players, but thankfully it does play on my computer!  I have to do some research to have the DVD converted to Region 1.

As to the quality of the performance - well just read the other reviews (all 4 & 5 stars)!  Like one of the other reviews pointed out, I found the slow motion, black and white, shots of Lara's performance to be REALLY annoying and detract from her STUNNING performance.

I deducted the one star because of the non-US dvd (even though I knew that before I purchased it), and for my other complaint about the film editing.

Stunning!",1436745600,,905,4.22093023255814

7973640,5,B0000714K1,"If you ever wished Celine Dion had as much stage as vocal appeal, Lara Fabian is the answer to that wish. With a voice as appealing while not quite as powerful, she's a delight to listen to and look at. This concert really shows her sincerity as it's her first rather emotional appearance in France.",1356048000,,299,4.454545454545454
7973641,5,B0000714K1,"Lara is one of the best performers I've ever seen when it comes to live shows. She simply has the crowd at her feet and they enjoy every minute of it. You will hear the crowd constantly singing along with Lara during the whole show. One thing that makes Lara's live shows so special is the fact that she puts her fans in the spotlight and moves herself to the background. This DVD proves it when the crowd enthusiastically sings Je T'aime, so that Lara breaks into tears of amazement and you get goosebumps all over your body. This show also includes Lara's cover of Africa by Toto (brilliantly done together with percussionist and background vocalist Dorian Sherwood). The show was recorded during her Nue tour, so you can expect a lot of her Nue songs on this show. A true highlight is when Lara walks through the crowd, surrounded by bodyguards, singing La Difference. It is also nice how she transformed Humana during this show, absolutely wonderful. The background vocalists, pianists, drummers, guitarists, to be honest the whole band simply lifts Lara's music to new heights during this show, but she acknowledges this by putting each member of the band into the spotlight during the show, which illustrates Lara's humble and beautiful personality. Each member of the band is truly gifted and makes the show one great pleasure to watch. Believe me this live performance will leave you breathless and after the 135 minutes you will be begging for more.",1143590400,7,1458,4.812749003984064
7973642,5,B0000714K1,"If there is anyone disappointed because Lara Fabian doesn't do any of her English-language songs here, then perhaps they should move on. Mme. Fabian is at her best when she's singing in French, and this footage (shot in Belgium and Paris venues) is superb.

A fan of her recordings for several years now, I was a little apprehensive about obtaining this DVD, not knowing what would be revealed by her live performance: would she have a quirky mannerism, a less-than-excellent pitch, an unattractive presence?  All of these concerns were quickly dashed, however, when, in the first frame, Lara settles on stage and accompanies herself on solo piano.  From that point on, the concert provides both musical and emotional magic. Lara's intonation is precise and her timing flawless. Add to that- she even moves gracefully. Her tender, sincere rapport with the audience, reflecting a phenomenal charisma, provides an apt complement to the incomparable voice I already knew she had.  She is supported by two very polished back-up vocalists and an accomplished rhythm section steadied by Pierre Grimaud at the piano.  Rick Allison, her one-time fianc and long-time writing collaborator, also joins her in a duet on ""Tu es mon autre.""

For those who seem to care, there actually is one song performed in English- a cover of the Toto song ""Africa""- done in a medley with Lara's composition ""Rio"" (BTW: she also sings another selection in Italian). Lara augments the concert with her three-song encore, changing into a sexy evening gown which makes her appear even more stunningly beautiful.  From beginnning to end, the pace is fresh and enjoyable, while her voice is like that of an angel!

In addition to the concert, a second disc includes some interesting rehearsal and back stage clips- insights into Lara the person.

  If I have any criticism of this package, it is that the film editors toyed with it too much. For the life of me, I don't understand why they found it necessary to include slow motion and pause shots of Lara as she is singing. You would think they'd realize that merely recording what occurred, which they otherwise do rather well, is  more appealing.  That slight objection aside, the DVD is still worth its weight in gold, and one that I highly recommend.  If you're not fluent in French, as I am not, believe me, it won't matter.  In the end, it is her music and voice that carry the moment, and like all great entertainers, she is even better live!!",1079308800,17,2469,4.859188544152745
7973643,4,B0000714K1,This is a December 2001 Paris concert. Audio (5.1 and DTS) and video is excellent. You will be disappointed to learn that none of her songs you may have heard in English are included.,1073001600,,183,4.411764705882353
