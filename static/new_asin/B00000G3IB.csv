8169118,4,B00000G3IB,"This one will mostly appeal to serious anime fans (particularly those who've seen Gall Force,) although there are some jokes that everyone will like. The first animated film is called 10 Little Gall Force and is about the making of the Gall Force movie. That is to say, it depics the animated charecters as real actors and the mistakes they make during the filming. This is actually much more fun than is sounds. Those who've seen GF may remember Lufa, a rather butch female fighter pilot. Here we see here in very girlish clothing and riding in a limo, and when traffic prevents her from getting to the set on time, she has her driver activate mechanical arms with which to toss other cars out of the way.
After this we cut to a live action interveiw with the japanese film maker. Some may find this interesting, but I ended up fast-forwarding to the next animated sequence.
After this we get to see a very brief Gall Force cartoon in which Lufa asks the other charecters if they're done getting with their differnt tasks of getting the film ready, and then pounds them when they say not.
Cut to another live action interview. Then we're back to animation, this time lots of different charecters form lots of different anime (including the crew of Gall Force,) are racing in their different vehicles across the desert to the finish line. Many charecters were from shows I'd never seen, but that didn't really matter. I understood most of the jokes regardless.
I found the live action segments kind of boring (some may disagree,) but otherwise I had a great time watching this, even though I prefer english dubbing. (There is no english language version for this film.) This would be a sound investment.",1023926400,,1703,4.68
