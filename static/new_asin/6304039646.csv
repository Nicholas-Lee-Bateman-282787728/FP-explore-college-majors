8223005,4,6304039646,"I liked this. Something I can't put my finger on, but it had a real, raw feel to it but wholly accessible to us Westerners/Americans.  It was strangely charming, just so gritty but endearing.  Another example that  less is more, so HEAR THAT JAMES ""cocky SOB"" CAMERON?  This had a  reduced, but REAL feel to it and it was bizarre for me admittedly to see  such a people I consider so 'backasswards' (as we say in TX) to have such  American cultural references.  All the characters were so believable, real,  affable, and the syncopated music was totally MTV.  An unusual experience  but a great, pleasurable one. C'est si bon....quel terrible!  C'est  magnifique!",950745600,,663,4.8125
