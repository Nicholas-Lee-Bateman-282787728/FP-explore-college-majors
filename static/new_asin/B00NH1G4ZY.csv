8678140,5,B00NH1G4ZY,"I learned so much from this series, well worth the money. We cultivate ginseng here in south central British Columbia and there is some wild but as it's so scarce no one bothers. It was good to see that one can make enough money in a season to  get by on but they sure work hard for it as did the camera crews. Good luck to you all and God bless.",1431129600,,346,3.8732394366197185
