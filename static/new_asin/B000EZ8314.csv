8115990,5,B000EZ8314,"This is a great little one hour story about a young man whose cello playing was significantly improved by the help of some animal friends. I though it was very well done and went by in a blink. Be cautious, though. This DVD does not come in region 1, meaning playable on US players. Despite being advertised as ""all regions"", it is actually region 2. You can still watch it on your computer (although, on my computer I can't figure out how to do subtitles. Fortunately, I've already seen it with subtitles) or you can buy a DVD player that plays all regions. Not a bad investment, since you will run across many great videos that you can only get in different regions.",1390348800,7,668,4.439024390243903
8115991,5,B000EZ8314,"This is classic studio ghibli, it's actually a pretty old film so don't expect modern production values, but this is one of the original films that put them on the map.

It doesn't get much publicity now days.

Note this is review is for the imported version, I'm not even sure this has had a US release.",1303516800,19,304,4.315789473684211
