7635035,1,B01BHGK7RQ,"The trailer left a lot to be desired after watching it I should have known, but I gave it a shot anyway.
It started off pretty good, but its really hard for me to enjoy movies where: number 1, the main character is so stupid, number 2, he asks absolutely no questions,  (spoiler alert) they told him Nadia pick to go in a new life, you would have never known, dude she didn't want you anymore. And if that's the case why did she kill the new Nadia and fight the team.
Lots of stuff didn't add up and don't make sense and I cant stand when they expect us to just go with the flow were not stupid.",1496620800,,595,4.0

And that's unfortunate because it could have been a very good sci fi thriller. I found myself at the end waiting to see if more of the movie was going to play during or after the credits to help explain what the end result meant but that didn't happen. I gave it more than one star because the story line was interesting and had potential but then it lost me by the end which is very frustrating. I would not recommend this movie.",1493251200,,548,4.179245283018868

7635045,1,B01BHGK7RQ,"Earth to millennials:  You get no points for simply being a millennial.  You still have to create movies with strong stories (not just ""high concept""), a good script (not sentence fragments), competent actors (no comment), and good direction (not ""interesting, shakey camera angles and ultra tight shots).  This thing has none of the above and stinks of film school unfinished hems that never get stitched together....and apologies to film schools.  Comparing Lucas's or Spielberg's first film school ventures really underscores how pathetic this film is. I guess I'm finally getting irritated by the influence of streaming sites which allow even the most inept ""auteur"" to see his/her on the small screen.

7635065,1,B01BHGK7RQ,"Nonlinear would be a nice thing to say, but that would only be a comment on the tediously overdone fascination with distorted architecture, which one must suppose is the director's agonizing way of expressing its complete dissociation from the actual forms of nature.  Is there a culture behind such a world, or is it simply self-indulgent neuroses posing as uniqueness?

Checked Wikipedia to see if this movie was maybe ""over my head"" and there's about a paragraph there, probably because there isn't anyone that vaguely understood what was supposed to be happening during this pretentious garbage. It's a shame: could have been some really cool things done with the concept (or what I could make of the supposed concept) my guess is that burried under all of the unecisarily long dragging scenes, liberal use of slow motion, and repeating shots, there could have been a good story here.

a this is an accurate, narcissistically boring repeat of the male dance in which he continually seduces and admires himself  by never ending reflection by means of  replication ad nauseum. The girl unnecessary as we always are. Simply another reflection through two  more lenses to reflect the gloriousness that is him. And what is more perfect than him occupying not just one life space but many, many,  of him within just one. Multiply that by the number  of spaces available when one does not follow the  specific rules intended to keep an equal balance. But those rules never apply to the extraordinary hypnotic being that is male , self absorbed and not required to follow the rules of nature, simply by definition. It's really not New U, but the realization of U with the supporting cast doing exactly what they needed to be doing in the prototype life that was not correct and needed to be ""New"" to complete the never ending loop  of narcissistic reincarnation to ensure continued propagation of the species.

Actually, it was 1/3 of a movie, since the same sequence of events play out 3 times without ever offering any explanation of anything.  The main character maintains the same moody stare throughout.  I suppose this was intended to be a meaningful and ""artistic"" reflection on man's helpless submission to something-or-the-other, but I was left reflecting on the fact that streaming movies is unlike watching them in a theater.

Visually this movie is a box office production, while I was expecting a student film going into it.  It is really well done visually.  The acting isn't terrible either.  It's the story that is lacking.  I never did figure out why another body was needed.  I never did figure out how they determined a business model would work where the person wanting to switch lives or whatever was the one who could afford that service.  It makes no sense he can remember his past or the monotonous work/life he goes into.  I guess in the context of 'this is an alternate reality nothing like reality' maybe it makes sense.

extremely  happy  i didn't pay anything to watch this or i would have  thrown my  pc out  the window.
on the other hand,,, someone,(invested alot of money  to produce this), namely irish  film board , dutch film board, and EUROPEAN union  film fund????
so THIS is how creepy  transhumanist, globalist beaurocrats spend all the europeans money. pushing garbage like this,? maybe
a nice full paid vacation for their board rich children  to go pretending to be a movie maker on this,, payed for by WHO >>

7635175,3,B01BHGK7RQ,"Well, I suppose I can say it's... ""imaginative"".  Nothing really makes any sense.  From the beginning, I'm left to wonder why, if someone is going to go to the trouble to have an ""identical"" move into her ""lifespace"", why would she she fall asleep and allow something like that get botched, to begin with?  This is the basis for the movie. Nadia, Slater's girlfriend, does exactly this at the beginning of the movie, setting off the events that send him ""down the rabbit hole"", as it were.  If it weren't for Nadia's carelessness, Slater's life would have continued on, relatively unaffected.  The next real problem I had with it was that I couldn't help but think that if someone had gone to this sort of trouble to give me the slip, that's a pretty strong message that she probably isn't ""the one for me"", after all and I would just try to move on with her and do my best to forget her.  Slater, on the the other hand keeps putting himself in the position of getting himself beat up as he's taught, over and over again that to ""look the wrong way only brings pain"" (or something like that). The Identicals company, which is supposed to be giving people new lives, for some reason keeps placing Slater within proximity of the very woman they're trying to keep him from and then sending guys to beat him up for it when he tries to talk with her.  After the second or third time this happened, I found myself really just wishing there was some way I could get my money back.",1464393600,16,1473,4.413284132841328

Granted it made for several beautiful shots, but overall it was like watching grass grow. Only less exciting. I kept watching, praying that there would be some kind of explanation or conclusion, anything really, but there wasn't.

The catch is that they must forgo their past and have no connection to it. So then they place new Slater and new Nadia working in the same building....guess how that works out.

The film, when not a confused mess, was a slow moving drama attempting to create confusion as it unravels it. Perhaps hard core science fiction fans might like it, I couldn't get into it. The main characters were boring and lackluster. They seemed to watch Slater every second of every day...except for that one time.

To say the movie is slow paced is to underestimate the glacial speed at which things happen.  The movie is filled with flashbacks, and characters often repeat what they say with slight variations to further fill the time.

(As slow as they are) if you don't pause to grab another sparkling water, you can miss the point of the entire movie in a flash!! Maybe the producers created it this way for a reason?? Maybe my local library has a copy of this. I'm also curious
about, if this movie is that bad..how can anyone sell it anyway?? Lol just wonder...
