8049533,1,B0007ODIG2,"I bought this DVD because it was supposedly full of good instruction on coaching and spotting gymnastics. I was expecting to be shown the correct way to do the exercises, and the correct way to spot for it. The Preschool workout only shows segments of the class, and is more like an advertisement for the class than instruction. The other two DVDs show instruction as if you have been in gymnastics for quite some time. I was looking for something like, how to do a handstand, cartwheel, backbend and walking on the balance beam correctly and how to spot the exercise correctly as well. I learned almost nothing from this DVD and feel that it was very misleading.",1169337600,19,663,4.627118644067797
