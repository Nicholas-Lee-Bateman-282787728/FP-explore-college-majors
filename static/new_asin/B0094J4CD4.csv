5262367,5,B0094J4CD4,"Overview:

The Tiny Tutor series is excellent - but you have to understand what its best used for. Here is my opinion as both a speech therapist and a single mother of a young boy:

Tiny Tutor is not about teaching your child how to comprehend words or do basic math. It is not about phonetics or addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. There are other DVD sets that are much more suitable for those tasks. To be fair, how many kids are doing this at 2-3 years of age? What I do appreciate is that it is very age-specific and appropriate for the target age its intended for - which is 9 months and older. It's important to know this before you buy.

These are my thoughts about Tiny Tutor:

1) Learning with Observation & Repetition:

The Tiny Tutor set teaches kids the two most important tenets of learning: observation and repetition. In today's educational product market, there are too many products that try to use fancy technology or gimmicks to speed up the learning process. Rote-learning products are the time-tested ways to teach anything to anyone, especially young children. Think back to when you were a child - how did you learn your ABC's or how to multiply? Most likely it was with the ABC song that you sang hundreds of times and with flash cards/multiplication tables (I still sing the ABC song in my head when I need to look up something alphabetically).

This is my take on why the Tiny Tutor DVDs work: adults learn new things by association (i.e. learning spanish after speaking english). But infants and toddlers don't have any frame of reference, so the only way they learn is by watching and imitating.

In addition to being the primary learning technique, committing things to memory serves critical function - it allows the brain to focus on more complicated tasks. Studies have shown chess players who memorize more chess positions (no different than numbers and letters) have significantly higher rankings then those who do not and have to think through each move. This applies to children as well: I have observed that children who read phonetically have slower word-per-minute speeds compared to kids who read by whole-word recognition.

Babies aren't born with spectacular memories. They are developed with practice - like any other skill or muscle. While I disapprove of ""Tiger Mom"" methods, I completely agree (with Amy Chua) that teaching children to work through boredom is ultimately the foundation to success. I am ""walking the talk"" by starting early with my son.

2) Presentation:

Video: The visuals are fantastic for babies & toddlers. They scroll across the screen very slowly and are simple, clear images of various animals, objects, and shapes. There is a good mix of color and movement but the graphics are not overwhelming. (NOTE: slow and steady is a GOOD thing!) This is important as studies have shown rapid screen flickering (found in most popular cartoons) can be detrimental to the attention spans of young children. As a mom I am very selective about what television programs I expose my son to; the content must be educational and the delivery must be acceptable. This DVD set passes both of my criteria.

Audio: The music is as promised: professionally composed. However since it is targeted towards young children, some adults may find it redundant and slightly annoying. I personally like it. The voice sounds crisp. I would have liked to hear a little more vocal variety but my son seems to understand and repeat the words with no issues. While monotonous, the pronunciations are consistent, which is very important for a child to absorb the words.

(NOTE: It's important to point out that kids generally have short attention spans. When my son gets bored of the videos, I allow him to go do something else while it plays in the background. I'll discuss the results later in this review.)

3) Proper Usage:

On the back of the box, the blurb says to use the DVDs like a ""visual picture book""; as a tool to encourage discussions between parents and children. I could not agree more. As a full-time working mom, (I feel guilty admitting) sometimes I'm too tired to create a learning ""syllabus"" for my kids. This is where the DVDs help.

The programs are great for content and repetition. The subject matter is basic enough (letters, numbers, shapes and colors), and is presented in a logical and sequential order. Where the parent steps in (IMO) is to provide context and questions about what's happening on the screen. I'll ask ""what color is that?"" or ""what shape is that?"", just to see if my son is retaining the material, or I'll ask a more critical question like ""what shapes are a house made out of?"" He's still pretty young, but I try to stretch his mind.

As much as I would love to, the unfortunate truth is I can't always sit down with my little one and interact with him (I am a single mom with a full-time job). But when I need a distraction while doing the dishes or pulling the laundry out of the dryer, I'm much happier knowing he is watching something educational making him a little bit smarter.

4) Results:

When my son was 13 months old, a good friend (who raved) about these DVDs recommended them, so I bought the set off of Amazon. Initially I didn't think much of the DVDs, but he seemed to show a mild interest in them. He would look up at the TV, play with his toys, and take a peek here and there. For some reason he seemed to really like the ""Shapes"" DVD so we kept that in the player.

The big surprise came about 2 weeks later, when he was playing with his shapes box in the living room. When I sat down next to him he grabbed a block and yelled ""STAR!"" I was blown away as he waved the star block with a big smile on his face. When I picked up the square, he also named it correctly. Excited, I grabbed the triangle and asked him what it was. He also called it a square - but hey 2 out of 3 isn't bad, right?

Now he is 2 months older, knows the numbers 1 though 6, can point out the colors red and blue, and knows what a star and square are (he seems to really like 'S' words?). For some reason he still can't identify the letters accurately on his own, but will speak along with the letters video until about the letter M.

I won't give the DVDs all the credit for teaching my little guy new words (I am of course a proud mother), but without question they have helped him to learn.

SUMMARY:

Pros:

- Highly effective in teaching young children how to observe and repeat.

- Well designed to keep a child's attention without over stimulating them.

- Comprehensive for basics, with equal time given to letters, numbers, shapes and colors.

- Great for learning with your child (or as a distraction if need be).

Cons:

- Can be monotonous and can drive parents a little crazy.

After all is said and done, I can wholeheartedly recommend this DVD set 100%. While I would never depend on the television to educate my child, I'm convinced it is an invaluable way to supplement his learning.",1347580800,570,6990,4.591164658634538

5262369,4,B0094J4CD4,"I like having my kids watch learning and educational shows when they do watch TV, it helps their education a lot. My oldest is two grades ahead, so I figured my other two might like to get a head start on learning their letters, numbers, shapes and colors. This DVD pack seemed like it would be a great idea. We popped in letters at first and my preschooler seemed very excited. We got to about H or I when she lost interest. While the DVD set up is a cute idea, it does not keep their attention.

The woman on the DVD is British, her voice is nice to listen to, but for some reason they introduce the character as a learning robot that will take them through the alphabet. Basically the DVD consists of the letter being shown, along with an item that starts with that letter, and said a few times in a row. While that is good for a few letters each day, I can't see any child wanting to watch an entire one of the DVD's (there are 4) in one sitting. They wanted to switch to colors/numbers etc. each time half way through they are ready for a different one. It is repetitive, which helps them learn, but there is nothing to break up the monotony, so the kids lose interest. So personally, I only put in the DVD for about 10 minutes each time to learn a little at a time. It has helped my preschooler learn a few letters.

The case is very cheap, the middle part that holds two discs, fell out of the case immediately. It was not made very well, but I just slipped it in the case when it is time to put it away.

My daughter knows 7colors, and can count to 3. This DVD helps her work on the other numbers and colors. My favorite DVD is the colors, listening her repeat the colors over and over is fun and she is learning. This is the only TV/DVD she will watch.

He is engaged by these DVDs, all except the colors, idk why, but they keep his attention and I'm glad to be able to have something that is fun for him and beneficial to his learning.

This DVD set is just 4 brief ""lessons"" (if you can call them that) that are nothing but static slideshows with an annoyingly repetitious soundtrack that I could have easily made myself on my computer--and with better production values to boot!  Let me clarify about the repitition... I realize that you must repeat concepts over and over to teach them to a child (""blue""...""blue""...""blue""... and so on).  The part that is insufferable is the soundtrack blaring throughout the entire thing.  It is just the same 30 seconds (basically the fair use limit so they don't have to pay for it) repeated over... and over... AND OVER ad nausium.

Then there is ""Abigail the Robot"".  My main question here is just...WHY??  This character is literally just an MS Paint doodle of a robot, completely UNANIMATED in any way, that introduces the ""lesson"" in a weird computerized British voice.  Aside from being annoying to listen to, it serves absolutely no purpose and isn't even interesting enough to get my child to look at the television.

5262416,5,B0094J4CD4,"I was asked to review this item, receiving it at no charge.
My 21 month old son is entranced by these DVDs. He especially loves the shapes DVD. There is a lot of repetition and things move very slowly-think Baby Einstein for reference. He has begun to identify the shapes he sees on the DVD everyday. We have been supplementing the DVD with puzzles and books on shapes but I think the DVD has definitely had a hand in his recognition of different shapes.",1436227200,38,454,4.416666666666667

5262418,5,B0094J4CD4,I bought these videos form our 14 month old. I was pretty unsure if he would like something more about education compared to the rather high tech graphic TV for kids out there. He really seems to enjoy them and it keeps his attention much longer than I would have expected. I think it is the repetition. If he happens to lose interest next time I just start the video near were he lost interest. It keeps him occupied and at worst he plays and looks up when he wants. People have made to big a deal of the British robot which is the very minimal host introducing each chapter. He does the best with letters and seems to like colors the least. Not sure why. I'd buy these again in a second.,1435968000,37,689,4.18796992481203

I was very excited about playing these for my 21 month old.  The DVDs are boring....  Very boring.  She would not even watch for a minute. We tried different DVDs hoping at least one of the 4 would be of interest...  But that wasn't the case.

Poor quality, cheaply made.  Definitely not worth the money.  I honestly think Amazon pays people to leave positive reviews otherwise I don't see how anyone can give these DVDs more than 1 star.

5262424,4,B0094J4CD4,"Bought it for my 19 month old speech-delayed twins.  DVD is quite repetitive and simplistic.  One toddler was mesmerized.  He was watching shapes and then colors.  It's literally just different images that pop on the screen and a voice over with the English name of the color or shape.  Over and over and over again, which is how they learn.  I can see how this will solidify their comprehension if they watch it enough times. Not sure whether it will encourage them to speak or not.  They hyper twin stop watching after 2 minutes though.  He prefers the puppets on Baby Einstein.",1434326400,2,580,4.617647058823529
5262425,5,B0094J4CD4,"I have a niece that just turned one and thought these video's would be a great learning tool for her,so I was excited to get them.
When they arrived it was time to surprise her with these dvd's and see how much she liked them. She usually only watches Mickey mouse and Minnie mouse and so I was worried she wouldn't get interested in them,but after dinner she was laying down and we put the first disk in. This is a four different set of dvd's and I wanted to of course watch the first one with her first since I couldn't stay very long.
She laid on my lap and it took her a few minutes to catch on to it even playing,but as soon as she did she laid back and watched the whole thing:) I was very happy to see that she liked it. Like I said she is very picky about what she likes.
Since then her mom has let her watch it over and over to help her relax and have something else to watch other than Mickey and Minnie:) The other video's are just as interesting to her and I'm glad she likes them :) With a child so young you never know how they will react to a learning video,but this makes it fun for there ages and so they enjoy it more:)
I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I think these video's are a great price and a great pick for young children at that age level.
I do believe my nephew who is 4 is also watching them and learning new things:)",1434326400,37,1435,3.9517241379310346

5262429,1,B0094J4CD4,Programs for toddlers have to be somewhat enjoyable for the adults that take care of them.  This product fails miserably in that regard.  It's incredibly repetitive.  The music is bad and my granddaughter ignored so what is the value.

5262431,5,B0094J4CD4,This was the cutest learning tool I have ever used for my children. Each DVD was equipped with learning tools that were fun and enjoyable. My daughter is 19 months old and was glued to the TV throughout the entire program. I have a feeling that it will not be too long before she is speaking along with the TV as she learns and grows. I am so happy with the product I recommend it to any mom who wants to give their child a head start on their educational growth!,1431388800,38,463,4.0989010989010985
5262432,4,B0094J4CD4,"The DVDs are designed around repetition (if it is a circle, they show a circle about 10 times.) This is great for children being introduced to shapes, numbers, colors, and letters for the first time. However, if your children already have a basic grasp of these categories then the DVDs are too slow paced.  I have 2 year old twins and they were getting frustrated because after seeing the ""A"" (for example) a few times, they wanted to move on, but it shows each letter, number, shape, color about 10 times each.  Think about the alphabet and showing each letter 10 times. To me, this is ideal for children 9 months - up to 2 years old, not the 2-3 year old range.",1431302400,2,664,4.390243902439025
5262433,5,B0094J4CD4,"These DVDs use very simple illustrations to show their concepts and use lots of repetition.  They also have a nice lively background music which isn't distracting or annoying (the repetition might seem a bit annoying but it really is important for getting these things down). I noticed that with the simplicity of the DVDs right away my daughter was repeating back the letters as they went through the alphabet. Nothing else was distracting her attention so she could pay attention to just the concepts being presented.  She just turned two and loves to learn so I am thrilled she is enjoying these DVDs.  Each lesson isn't very long and sometimes my daughter doesn't sit through the whole thing but she does pay attention here and there and I can already tell she is starting to recognize a couple letters.  She has her numbers and shapes down pretty well already but I was having trouble getting her past 14 on my own so hopefully these wil help!  They won't take over you teaching your child but they can definitely help, especially where you might be stuck.  Very happy so far!

I have tried having him watch cartoons and kid's tv shows and he got bored and went back to playing with his toys and getting in to things (he's a year old and in that 'curious' stage). I played these DVDs for him and he seems to be enjoying  watching it; it's never too early to start teaching our babies and getting them prepared for educational activities. The author takes a unique approach by using repetition and music, which helps the little ones to learn. The educational activities consist of shapes, colors, letters and numbers.

We have not had the opportunity to use all the discs yet, but after the first 2 I am impressed. They are a good length for a baby's attention span and have good content to begin learning the basics.

I remember when I first watched it I was impressed with how the series utilizes repetition to teach basic concepts. As a child psychologist I am very familiar with how children learn and what keeps them engaged.  These DVDs use animation in combination with music that keeps a child interested and learning.  When I was offered a complimentary sample of this series for my review, I jumped at the chance.  Like I said, I was already very familiar with these DVDs and was impressed with it's effectiveness.  I look forward to playing these in the waiting room to entertain and teach the younger children that come to my office.  Highly recommend!

When I read the reviews saying that it was repetitious, I thought they were talking about the repetition of the main subject, e.g., repeating, ""one, one, one"". That repetition I could have lived with. What I needed to know to tell me that I would be giving this set away as soon as I listened to two and a half of the discs was that the music refrain is about ten seconds that repeats over and over and over and over and over and over and over -- well you get the idea. It is awful to anyone who has an ear for music. In my opinion, this is a definite do not buy, especially if you plan on being within hearing range.

Recently I find him reciting the alphabet by heart and in correct order. It is pretty awesome. :) And he learned to recognize the numbers, colors and shapes too. He has watched them since he was about a year old and 6 months later he was able to recognize everything the dvds have to teach. He asks for the dvds every single day.

We got this DVD a while back, a month or so ago. So I popped in the DVD and my daughter was watching it and she was focused on the animations. I could tell she liked all the different objects and bright colors on the screen. It's so easy to use and it entertains her. She watches the DVDs everyday for about an hour, and in only a few weeks she's doing great and has progressed so far! I also liked how the DVDs were labeled by the different sections. It made it so much easier for me because all I had to do was sit her in front of the TV and she could watch each DVD. She is learning so much because of these DVDs. Hands down a great product!! I will definitely recommend this DVD set to my other friends with children.",1406419200,45,907,4.016574585635359
5262471,5,B0094J4CD4,"I recently purchased this for my 20 month old daughter and I must say this DVD set is an excellent learning tool for children her age. So far the videos have really helped my child learn to identify colors and numbers. She likes to count now, which is adorable, and I feel like she is on the right track to learning these basic skills.

In addition to that, I am a huge fan of the simplistic animations. The makers of this DVD set really designed this for a particular age group. Some videos on the market include overwhelming graphics which can result in overstimulating a child of such a young age. Everything is very simple and the screen moves slowly so toddlers can keep up and are entertained.

I highly recommend this to any parent that wants to start their child on the correct learning path.",1406246400,38,800,4.472602739726027

She is just about 2 years old and she has blossomed so much from watching this video.

My daughter is 18 months and I'm trying to get her interested in learning without all the flashy graphics that will dull her attention span. The animations in these DVDs are simple but in the best way! They hold her attention and help her learn but they're not too complex for her to follow along. I mainly wanted something to help her along with number and letters and this does that! It's such a great feeling watching her learn and enjoy it too!,1406073600,35,528,4.3979591836734695

What I really love about it is that the animations are so simple and easily recognizable to a young child.  They bring a smile to his face and mine, as a caregiver. In these DVDs you learn letters, shapes, numbers, and colors.  Those are the 4 basic things that any child needs in their fundamental skills.  This gets an A+ from me and my nephew too!",1404518400,34,438,4.117647058823529
5262476,5,B0094J4CD4,"As my sister was preparing to teach my nephew of all of 20 proud months old, she reached a bit of a conundrum, namely: what do I start with? And, further, How??

She was thinking maybe, let's start with letters & colors. It was her understanding that these were the most essential-- and by this she meant: 'Easiest.' I did not approve of adopting a method of instruction based solely on the criteria of; 'Ease.' I pointed out to her that, numbers and shapes were perhaps the more important areas of instillation in the young mind as they had the more accurate likelihood of getting the lad to learn to think logically, to analyze, compute, and get one of those high paying careers of the future in Maths/Sciences/etc..

She said, 'well, you are not his father!' I pointed out that that was precisely the soft thinking I was hoping to avoid, just as she had avoided any real debate and instead fell back on her ownership of the boy based upon parentage. and while I respect that, and told her, I also pointed out, 'you have, of course heard of the Beethoven/music listening theorems, and the baby Einstein courses and such-like?' She responded in the affirmative. Well, I put it to her, let us pursue it all as one great holistic package, shall we?

She agreed, and set me on a course of browsing and shopping that was as thorough as it was exhaustive. What I came up with was this: Tiny Tutor! Now, there are a LOT of these types of course on the market, but what really drew me in is the adage, learn to crawl before you can walk. -and while I aspire for my nephew to be a rocket scientist or an astronaut when he is grown, we have to get there first! The easy to use, follow and understand animations sold me on it. This way I did not have to be around to supervise it 24/7, and my sister really couldn't botch it, either! Heh-

I will give this product 2-thumbs up & a highly recommend. Skies the Limit!",1404086400,43,1906,4.3605633802816905

I also know a couple of other families that use the same videos with their kids and they are both having the same amount of success. The repetitive nature and simple animations in these videos seem to work wonders in getting them to learn within a short amount of time. It is amazing to see a young baby recognizing colors, shapes, letters and numbers so early in life.

I like that the animations are very simple which works really well for children of her age. She follows along with the videos carefully watching the screen when I play them. I'm even able to step away for a little bit to prepare a snack or do some quick chores and when I get back she's still attentively watching.

I was afraid it was going to be rapid and flashy like TV which in my opinion is not a good thing to put in front of young children. The music was great. Catchy in that Disney kind of way and when I played it for my nephew the first time he was trying to follow along right away, which was cute but also a good sign. Subsequently his mom said she was using it as a way to read to him when she was too worn out to do so, which I think was suggested on the box and she said it was working. So I'm happy with the purchase since it made me the hero. I'll give it five stars and keep my eyes out for more from this seller. I have a new niece that'll be ready for this next year.

The colors and characters in the DVD's are entertaining and fun.

It's a little slow for adults, but it wasn't made for adults and she really seems to enjoy it!  It can't take the place of playing with your child and teaching them hands on, but it's a great program to have on when you need time to fold laundry, or work on the computer.

The DVD's teach babies how to observe, recognize and repeat what they see, which is the basis for learning.

I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.

However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it. The music is not so bad though.

Pros:

First of all it does a great job delivering the educational content we expected it to, in a manner which as it appears makes a lot of sense to a two years old, since she seems to be picking up the material pretty good and results are showing rather quickly.  Another reason for which we find the product to be so useful is simply because it is fun to watch, and keeps the child's attention focused on it for a relatively long time, so we know she's having fun.

He wasn't talking and was doing the usual baby talk n pointed at everything he wanted. I purchased the baby babble series to start with. All 3 was very excited and done very well with them. They all are talking now and learned from them from start. So I purchased Tiny tutor to move on with numbers letters n colors.

She is not very vocal yet however she sits mesmerised whenever I allow her to watch it.  She loves ""counting"" and loves pointing out shapes and colors and letters in her surroundings and I credit this DVD to a large extent for these early learning.  She is really learning a lot from it.  I would really recommend these as a introduction to these early learning concepts.  I am just sorry I had not started showing these DVDs to her earlier (I bought the DVD set when she was just a few weeks old).",1459209600,,598,4.247787610619469
8535961,1,B0094J4CD4,"We had high hopes for this DVD set.  It was more expensive than the Baby Einstein and Leapfrog, but the description and ratings made it sound perfect!

Our little girl is 16 months and loves TV when we let her watch it.

These arrived, and we put into the DVD player (which was already a bit of a drawback for a family that uses Netflix and other streaming almost exclusively).

The video seemed like it was made by amateurs... very simple graphics (some, like the ""robot"" narrator seemed like a single image with a slow zoom in on the face, with a voice over of a computer, the kind you get when you have the computer read text...).  The alphabet episode was a woman saying ""A"" over and over again, with some loosely related stock photos of ""A"" words, or just the letter ""A"" zoomed in and out with a flower background.  The whole program follows the exact same format, Robot picture (not animated, just a still image) introduces a letter, and the letter gets on and zooms in and out (same backgrounds for every letter), and then a few pictures.

Again, it just seemed like someone made this on final cut (or dare I say Powerpoint) with a very low budget, and not much effort.  I know it's for babies, but COME ON!

And, in the end, all of this could have been forgiven, except for the fact that even my baby who LOVES to watch TV, anything, seriously.... even she couldn't make it through 3 minutes of this without it losing her attention.

Not worth the money.  First thing I have ever returned to Amazon.

Also - the kicker - they charged us a $20 restocking fee.  YES.  $20.",1455840000,,1578,4.378006872852234

8535963,5,B0094J4CD4,"When it comes to our children and their education, you can never start teaching them too young. It really is amazing how young they are when they start learning about the world around them and how things work. When my own girls were small I loved watching them as they became aware of their surroundings or when they would pick up a new skill. Now that they're all grown up and I have a new little one in the house to love on, I'm excited to watch the process all over again as well as to implement new ways to help our new addition learn in a fun way!

Tiny Tutor is a 4 DVD set that centers around letters, numbers, shapes and colors. Geared towards little ones who are ages 1, 2, and 3, Tiny Tutor is a fun DVD set that will help your little one reach their fullest potential in their early development years. Relying on research, Tiny Tutor differentiates itself from other programs like Baby Einstein and gives the young brain only what it needs to learn.

This DVD set is also great because it uses repetition as one of it's key teaching strategies. The repetition of patterns in the videos are set to professionally composed music that aids in working with the brains natural instincts. By setting each program to music and inserting repetition into the mix, each lesson is more easily retained while still being fun and engaging for little ones.

Key features of the Tiny Tutors DVD Set include:
~ Start your baby early on the path to success
~ Teaches children repetition using patterns and images
~ Basic and slow paced animations to prevent over stimulation

The packaging indicates this series is for ages 9 to 36 months but our 4 and 5 year old both love these DVDs.
