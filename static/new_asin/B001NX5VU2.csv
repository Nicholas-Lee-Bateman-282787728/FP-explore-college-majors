8328046,4,B001NX5VU2,"Wow, this is one insanely ludicrous sex-comedy that raised the bar substantially in its usage of non-PC humor in an era already known for its outlandishness and excess! In ""El sexo sentido"" from 1981 (which roughly translated means: ""The Sex Sense"" or ""Sex Sensation""), we get a hyperactive-macho-induced fantasy of female flesh that makes one wonder---how/why did this film ever get made? But, let's leave that aside and let the sociologists and historians to figure that one out. Without further detraction, our story is about lovely-nubile 'Patricia Fria' (played by sexy and beautiful Spanish-import Adriana Vega), who is the ""kept woman"" of old-and-rich but sadly impotent 'Don Toms Cebollita'. It seems that 'Patty' has been trying to cure 'Don Toms' for some time now. Enter starving artist 'Miguel ngel Cuevas' (Andrs Garcia) who happens to live directly across from 'Patty' and gets an inkling of all the extra-curricular activity going on across the way ('Patty' never seems to wear any clothes at all, except see-through nighties!), and purchases a telescope and is soon in business with his own 'observation-deck/peep-show' and charges the local rich old-men a handsome price, etc. etc. I can go on and on in trying to summarize this story, but I'll cut it short and get to the chase.

Sex-bombshell---Rossy Mendoza does a sizzling-hot strip-tease in a crazy night-club, that unlike kerosene; will really melt steel girders!! There's a small appearance by another sensual-creature of the time-period----Gloriella. And as I said already, Adriana Vega and Rossy Mendoza are on full display literally 80% of the time (it really gets hedonistic when they all retreat to a nudist resort towards the end of the film). There's FFN galore from all the female-leads and then some, what more can you ask for.

The cast: Andrs Garcia, Adriana Vega, Rossy Mendoza, Sergio 'El Comanche' Ramos, Eduardo 'El Mimo' de la Pea, Jaime Moreno, etc., etc.

BTW: Eduardo de la Pea AKA 'El Mimo' gives an over-the-top performance as a crazy psychiatrist with an Oedipus complex, silly but hilarious! Adriana Vega was in a dozen Spanish sex-comedies and I think this was her only foray in a Mexican one, for her alone this feature is worth the price of admission and, the main reason (with the addition of Rossy Mendoza of course) as to why I needed to add this one to my collection. Enjoy it with an open mind, but believe me you will still shake your head in disbelief at the zany antics in this blast from the past.

The DVD picture quality from Grupo Nuevo Imagen is mostly very good, in some parts it seems the print suffered from too much erosion beyond repair, but overall the quality is pretty good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 94 mins.

One last thing: Adriana Vega's character's last name was 'Fria' which is a pun for 'frigid', which she was anything but!

Love and Peace,

8328047,5,B001NX5VU2,"Excellent. It doesn't pretend being serious, plenty of popular music, jokes in Spanish which I don't understand anyway and cherry on top of cake is  we treated to a visit to nudist resort where we have pleasure of dreaming about the way the life should be.",1436918400,,256,4.565217391304348
