8226176,5,B000WZAE1S,"Came on time and in great condition. Just a continuation of the series. Vol. 5 wasn't as entertaining as the volumes previous, but still good.",1391990400,,142,4.72
8226177,5,B000WZAE1S,"The beginning went slow.. but then suddenly I became captivated with it. The whole idea of the series taking place entirely inside of an online RPG is even more interesting than it sounds. Ever play one of your RPGs and think ""This is so good.. I kinda wish it were an anime.""? Well that's kinda what .hack//SIGN is. .. and if you don't like watching it, you can always invest your money in the .hack video game series for PS2 instead.",1223337600,,435,4.382716049382716
