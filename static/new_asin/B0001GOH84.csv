1998597,5,B0001GOH84,I've Luvd Judge Reinhold as an actor for awhile so I bought this movie it's more like a male version of Freaky Friday which I also enjoyed esp the 70's version.,1342915200,,160,4.193548387096774
1998598,4,B0001GOH84,"Judge Reinhold did an excellent job of portraying a 10 year old kid.  And Fred Savage's attitude as a stressed-out, overworked adult, suddenly lunged into an inconvenient situation of being trapped in a kid's body was hilarious while being in a very high financial position for a major department store.

Judge Reinhold plays a divorced overworked department store product purchaser and he struggles to even find time to spend a weekend with his son that he tries to do but his job is just too demanding of his time.

Judge Reinhold and his fellow worker girlfriend (played by the gorgeous underrated Corinne Bohrer) go to Thailand and buy a beautiful vase, which he actually loses to an unintended trade-off for a stolen ancient magical skull.

Anyway, further into the film, Judge Reinhold was holding the skull the same time his son was touching it, and they made a rhetorical statement that they wish that they could switch lives with each other, and so that's what happened.  The mystical skull switched their bodies and the hilarious antics begin from there.

I enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed the movie ""Big"" with Tom Hanks. Which was basically on the same subject of a father and son switching roles.  I think because the young Fred Savage was so convincing with his mature mentality with the situation of sounding and acting like an adult, that is what makes this movie so much more entertaining.  The way he fought back at the kids at school who usually picked on him, was priceless.

This is just another example of great 1980's movie entertainment.",1273881600,,1567,4.817164179104478
1998599,5,B0001GOH84,Savage and Reinhold really seem to be enjoying the roles they have taken on in this very funny body switch film. It is the best movie I have seen using this over used premise. This is a movie that holds up with repeat viewings.,1174867200,,227,4.181818181818182
1998600,5,B0001GOH84,It's fair to say that if Judge Reinhold is in a film you know it is going to be good - and the same can be said about Fred Savage. If you stick them both together the results are always going to be both hilarious and moving. I don't know why you don't see so much of either of these two acting heavyweights these days - they must have got bored of all the fame and adulation.,1148688000,,375,3.883116883116883
1998601,5,B0001GOH84,"don't miss this Movie,'tis a very great Movie,I have it on dvd,a well done work :)",1145145600,,82,4.1875
1998602,5,B0001GOH84,..When you think about it - because he is also inside the Judd Reinhold characters mind. So there are two Fred Savages running around at once!. This automatically makes this film twice as good as any other film ever made. If only those bozos who made Attack of the Clones had used Fred Savage to make the clone army out of. A wasted opportunity.,1132012800,,345,4.40625
1998603,5,B0001GOH84,"Vice Versa is one of the funniest comedies about a child changing places with an adult.  There are several other movies like this in which the mind of a child occupies an adult body and, in this case, vice versa, or some similar variation.  They include Like Father Like Son, Freaky Friday, Big, Dream A Little Dream, Eighteen Again, and The Kid.  In Vice Versa Judge Reinhold plays Marshall Seymour, a divorced department store purchaser who has his son  Charlie (Fred Savage of The Wonder Years, The Wizard, etc.) for the weekend.  Marshall just returned from a buying trip in the orient, mistakenly in posession of a magical skull.  Charlie thinks his dad's unfairly ragging on him and in the midst of an argument, he finds the skull and Marshall tries to take it away from him.  Just as they are both handling it, in the heat of argument Charlie wishes they could trade places, and they do.  Before they figure out how to change back, Marshall has to attend Charlie's school in the boys body, and Charlie has to go to work at the department store as Marshall, as well as deal with the man's rocky relationship with his girfriend.  All these situations provide plenty of laughs.  One of my favorite parts is when Charlie's mother walks in on them, and sees her son Charlie - really her ex Marshall - drinking a martini.  His reaction is as funny as hers:  ""S*#& what's she doing here?""  You have to see it to get it.  Other good comedy emerges from Charlie's adventures as a grownup in the department store and Marshall's experiences as a kid, dealing with bullies and teachers at school.  It has a happy ending",1121817600,11,1614,4.574912891986063

1998640,3,B0001GOH84,"This is the quintessential example of a movie you loved as a kid but are ashamed that you liked it after rewatching it.  Very formulaic, and it is almost like Judge and Fred didn't meet before the movie, even though the trivia says that they met extensively.  The joke of the jerk father being in the son's body went on WAY too long, and there never felt like there was any real conflict.  The script probably just said, ""Fred Savage acts like a jerk to everybody, even though he is really an adult inside and should have realized a long time ago that he can't get away with acting like that.""",1471564800,,593,4.324324324324325
1998641,3,B0001GOH84,"The basic premise of a father switching bodies with his son offered the potential for an inexhaustible array of funny happenings. This did not happen in this movie. The script was lame, the scenes contrived. Choosing a baby-faced actor as a father reduced the absurdity gap and therefore the possible laughs. The introduction of the museum expert with the fake accent was unnecessary. Father and son could have reversed the magic on their own, after a couple of attempts with hilarious results. The big hunk of time taken in scenes involving the girlfriend added little to the comedic aspects of the situation. In all, this movie failed to make me laugh. It deserves no more than 2 1/2 stars.",1471046400,,692,4.823529411764706
1998642,4,B0001GOH84,I have just watched this movie again and it sure bought back some memories. Though it might be a little dated it was still fun to share with the whole family. Take a step back and see what movies were like in the 80's!,1470787200,,218,3.977272727272727

1998771,5,B0001GOH84,"We rented the HD version of this movie and watched it last Sunday.  The '80s clothing and music was entertaining.  But surprisingly, the acting was pretty good as well, especially from the kid played by Fred Savage.  Judge Reinhold was a little bit over-acting, but then it is alway harder for an adult to act as a child, than vice-versa.

There were very minimal inappropriate adult jokes in this film, so it is a better choice compared to Big and Like Father, Like Son.  Obviously, this is probably the lesser known of the three movies, but it doesn't matter, now that we are in 2016.  Every movie made 20 years ago will look like a collector's item - at least that is what our kids think.

Overall, this was a fun movie, with lessons to take-away.  We are one of those families that don't mind movies that have a message.  Even nowadays, people prefer gritty reality-based movies, we still want our family time movies to be wholesome and fun.  So if you are like us, I highly recommend this film for family time.",1461542400,,1015,4.497267759562842

You've got Fred Savage, a kid who - to my knowledge - never, EVER came off as a kid in anything he ever acted in, and you've got Judge Reinhold, a guy who generally just always has a certain youthfulness to him, both cast in another take on the Freaky Friday formula. Before the switch, Fred Savage is every bit as awkward as you can imagine in his role as Judge Reinhold's character's son. From the moment the switch occurs, however, hilarity ensues, and both Fred Savage and Judge Reinhold nail their reversed roles. Highly recommended.",1401235200,3,594,4.613207547169812

When father and son have a stern conversation the son wishes that he could change places the father says the same all while his son holds a skull that his father brought back from an overseas trip... When their spirits switch... It leads to funny and eye opening situations... Judge Reinhold is perfect as the father son as he is able to capture the innocence of youth..
