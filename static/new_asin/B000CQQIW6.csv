8100742,2,B000CQQIW6,"Better than nothing, except maybe reading. These Kultur video's are the least satisfying of all the art history or individual artist video's I have seen, and I have seen a lot. I came to this amazon sight specifically to see if my netflix video coming was Kulltur""s or not. I should have checked first. My excitement for the next video fell flat. The expert art historians are the same ones for each video so though they know more than the average joe they are not specialists in this time period or any other. these video were made on the cheap when they zoom in on a painting you can see the pattern in the print, so it was out of an art history book or something. So I just finished watching this with an eye and ear to why these kultur documentary's are weak. First off the writing is terrible. Compared to a doc by Simon Schama this is irritatingly poor writing. Yes facts are presented information served but the cook should be fired. Next they are desperately trying to talk about the renaissance not late medieval. There is no mention of Lorenzetti or Tadeo Gaddi just to name a few skipped 13-14 century painters. In short this is a general 101 intro class that might put you to sleep and not inspire you to look further. Kultur= ""Dark Ages"" some one like Schama or Robert Hughes = The Sistine chapel.",1397260800,,1310,4.439834024896266
8100743,3,B000CQQIW6,"The 12th century seems to have been the beginning of an era of change for Europe with the crusades.
The video has pretty good coverage of late medieval art with fresco, perspective, architecture,styles and early oil painting.
The treatment of shading and life drawing could probably be better.
I'd say it was a good review and you get how to pronounce of the names
which doesn't come from just reading books about art history.
This one ends at about the time of Da Vinci.
I liked it, even with the British high tone curator lectures.",1242777600,3,533,4.621052631578947
8100744,4,B000CQQIW6,"For the record, this is a perfectly sound, well researched and very well illustrated (with art and architecture) review of the period. The accompanying music is atmospheric. Insight is provided into the medieval mind, and there is sensible consideration of artistic methods, as well as historical and social elements. There is certainly no egregious error or misstatement; it's a pleasant film, and touches on as many significant areas as can be expected from a survey of this length. The on-camera experts certainly seem qualified.

Now, to address the review by Winefred's Well: while it's true that reviews on Amazon are often used to vent (as in my review of Tom DeLay's detestable - and pathetic - excuses in No Retreat, No Surrender) it seems appropriate to adopt a more academic tone when reviewing documentaries; a process which might be expected to include seeing the film before commenting.

Van Eyck not Medieval? Well, he was born ""around 1390""; let's see, 1415, Battle of Agincourt, hardly the Renaissance. Late Middle Ages certainly, but not an outrageous description by any means. Dark Ages as a historical term? When God and his saints slept? I received a degree in history from a major English university, and my instructors certainly used that term. Oh, so Ireland wasn't participating in that period of crime and ignorance? THAT sounds like a fairy tale.

The reviewer's comments may be accompanying a belief that the world began in 4000 BC. She'll like that Creation Museum!",1182297600,15,1494,5.065040650406504
8100745,1,B000CQQIW6,"No reputable historian ever uses the term ""Dark Ages"" since this is an inaccurate and pejorative term for a period in which art and learning were thriving in Byzantium and many places in western Europe (Ireland, for instance).  Moreover, anyone who places Van Eyck in the Middle Ages is simply an ignoramous and should not be passing him/herself off as an expert on any aspect of history.  It may be that these errors do not occur within the DVD under review, but are merely the gaffes of whoever wrote the ""editorial review"".  I haven't actually seen ""Landmarks of Western Art"" and the review does not encourage me to do so.  I guess this might disqualify me from writing a review, but after all, this is Amazon.com-- since when do reviews have to be written by people who've actually seen the product?!  Just check out books by writers like Kate O'Beirne, whose work has been subject to a massive free-for-all of mud-slinging from people who clearly have never read a word of it.",1138233600,8,981,4.680232558139535
