I have to understand Hollywood's point to a limit: They couldn't adapt A TON of stuff in the book itself, and they had to take some liberties. But making this into a RomCom was the wrong way to do it. I think in one of the ""Behind the Scenes"" snippets, the director purposefully had to make it a RomCom in order to appeal to more folks; but a buddy cop side story? I could think of other ways to make it appealing to more folks without the forced hilarity.",1425081600,,713,4.3283582089552235

David Bowie's wife Iman is strolling around as a baddie, but I didn't make it to the end to find out or even remember what the detectives were there to do.

637422,4,6303383238,"An easily forgettable film, some would have you believe. As a big fan of Dana DeLaney, Dan Aykroyd and Rosie O'Donnell, I just had to see it again to remember. I actually saw Exit to Eden in the theater when it first appeared, and promptly forgot about it.

At that first viewing of Exit to Eden, DeLaney's character made me uncomfortable. My previous exposure to the actress was through her role as Army nurse Colleen McMurphy in the TV series China Beach. There wasn't much not to love about her McMurphy character. Her Lisa Emerson character in ""Exit"" seemed to be the exact opposite of her China Beach character, through gross assumption.

And by gross assumption I mean my quick-to-judge reaction to what her character was in the ""Exit"" film: a Madam (Mistress) of a thinly disguised high-class BDSM-themed ""resort"". My assumption was that Ms Emerson was intended to be a stereotypical ""madam"".

Not so, I am thinking now.

Lisa Emerson of ""Exit"" has much in common with Colleen McMurphy of ""China"". Both spent much of their screen time either performing triage or rendering first aid: to victims of combat trauma in McMurphy's case and to the victims of deficient upbringing (sexual inhibitions) in Emerson's case.

The BDSM theme of ""Exit"" is what derailed me the first time in recognizing this similarity. This may be what derails many other would-be fans, as well.

OK, and both characters are gorgeous, too...

Maybe another thing that derails some folks is the relative lack of screen time afforded Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd, despite their high billing. Dan is his often-played Joe Friday/Elwood Blues hybrid, and Rosie is, well, Rosie. I love them both; but, sadly, not enough of them are in this movie.

That may actually be a real benefit, though. I believe the major story line of this movie is carried well enough by the Lisa Emerson/Elliot Slater (Paul Mercurio) relationship. The story line may have been better served with a set-up played by lesser known actors, but I always enjoy watching Dan and Rosie work.

I think, too, that there's always a heart to Garry Marshall's films, and this is no exception. It may be that if you find yourself in the ""thumbs-down"" camp on this one, then you may do yourself proud to examine your own level of inhibition on matters of a sexually intimate nature. I believe the message here is that everyone harbors incorrect beliefs about themselves and about others; but there is lots of fun to be had finding out how wrong you have been.

I don't think the film is saying that BDSM play is necessarily the answer to all sexual inhibition, either; it just provided a jarring and effective way to illustrate the nearly universal need to overcome it.

And, oh yes, it provided a welcome excuse to see, ah, more of Dana DeLaney... Well done!",1292889600,2,2796,4.780082987551867

637460,2,6303383238,"What were they thinking? Perhaps director Garry Marshall thought he could do for S&M what he'd done for the women of the evening in Pretty Woman. Wrap up an edgy topic in a big cute bow, and through humor make it palatable, even entertaining, to the masses. But you thought wrong Mr. Marshall. Actually, it is a surprisingly entertaining movie, it is just that most of the humor is unintentional. You can't believe the movie got green lighted when it was so obviously doomed to be a disaster.

They took a novel by Anne Rice, written under the pseudonym of Anne Rampling (a name she chose as a tribute to actress Charlotte Rampling) and then they grafted on a totally gratuitous story about international jewell thieves and the cops (played by Dan Akroyd and Rosie O'Donnell??? and no, I am not making this up. Who could make up stuff like that?) who pursue them. Their names are Sheila Kingston and Fred Lavery. Sometimes their shtick is amusing, but more often than not it just lowers the tone of the film--which wasn't that high to begin with.

---------------------------------------
Fred Lavery: Ok, well, I guess I'm off to your little S&M fantasy island, where the little guy runs around yelling, ""The pain! The pain!""

---------------------------------------
Sheila Kingston: How do you decide you wanna be a dominatrix? What, do you wake up one day and go, ""Hey, I feel like being bossy""?
---------------------------------------

I mean, who wants to see Akroyd OR O'Donnell in black leather bondage gear? O'Donnell undercover as a stripper is particularly cringe worthy.

It is a whole 'nother story though, to see red headed stunner Dana Delaney in and out of her outfits. As Mistress Lisa Emerson, the proprietress of an unusal island resort called Eden, she is something to witness. I wondered why I hadn't seen more of her, but I bet you that this stinkeroo of a motion picture hung around her neck like an albatross. Great career move, Dana. Lately, though, she can be seen on Wisteria Lane as the newest, and most desperately Desperate Housewife, Katherine Mayfair.

---------------------------------------
Lisa Emerson: After a hard day of smacking people, it's nice to cuddle.

Also apparantly cursed by being a part of this misbegotten misfire was Paul Mercurio, an Australian who formed a dance company down under, turned down a part in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and then had a hit in Strictly Ballroom. Unfortunately, he parlayed that success into this vehicle from hell. He plays photographer Elliot Slater, and his romance and pursuit of Lisa is the only part of the story that even remotely works.

---------------------------------------
Lisa Emerson: Babies *and* bondage, I could do both?
Elliot Slater: Yeah, I'd love to say, ""My wife is a dominatrix.""
Lisa Emerson: I can just see myself at the kids' school on career day.
---------------------------------------

Last but not least, Iman plays Nina Blackstone, a professional assassin in pursuit of Elliot and some incriminating photos of his. She looks marvelous, and though her acting is not going to win her any awards, she is extremely watchable. Born in Somalia, she went on to become a supermodel. She is married to David Bowie, and also holds the distinction of being the last woman to kiss Captain James T. Kirk as Martia in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Her character in Exit to Eden is not written very well, but she too looks good in her outfits. An example of the sloppy writing would be that early on, she has a cold and sneezes. You think it will be some kind of clue, some little loose end to be tied up later. But it never is, and if it was supposed to be, it is like, they just gave up, they just gave up trying alltogether.

Though I never read any of the Vampire books of Anne Rice, other people have said that she really took the idea of the vampire and worked with it. She knew a good symbol when she saw it, and she never metaphor she didn't like.

""The vampire is always presented as someone who is living a heightened existence and that is very seductive,"" says Anne Rice. ""He is also someone who is able to satisfy all of his cravings. I don't see this as a time of weakness at all. The vampire image reflects the enormous leap in visual perspective. This is the time of Federal Express, long-distance calls and faxes. Someone can get up in the morning and call New York or Paris. All kinds of business transactions and close book deals can be made -- it's like flying all over the world. Vampires are superhuman magnifications of us, of the way we feel in these powerful times.""

Anne also says that ""The vampire is that glittering, dazzling rule-breaker and outsider who has gained ascendancy over time and place.""

I did read Exit to Eden, but it was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I am sure that it was well written, much more so than the script for the movie.

""To write something,"" says Anne Rice, ""you have to risk making a fool of yourself.""

She didn't make a fool of herself by writing the book, but the movie version, like Sexy Sadie, ""made a fool of everyone.""

637462,2,6303383238,"I first viewed this movie on HBO or something several years ago and was quite intrigued by the plot premise.  My opinion is that this COULD have been an interesting and stimulating exploration of human kink...(but NOOOOOOOOO).  I thought the movie began to explore and illustrate some of the mental and emotional aspects of a dominant/submissive relationship and found the scene of bondage and light discipline exciting and exhilerating. But then....the meddling hands of Gary Marshall et al, turned Ms. Rice's Exit To Eden into some bizarre hybrid from hell in hopes of increasing its commerical marketability.

I guess America is not ready for an honest, thought-provoking look at actual sexual/erotic behaviors.  I'm really sorry Exit became Bowderized by the addition of ""comedy"" and a subversive co-plot.  Maybe I'll read Ms. Rice's book before someone starts burning them.",1210636800,,878,5.333333333333333

637464,5,6303383238,"wow some people got the wrong idea about his movie!  one person seems to think this movie was a horror movie which is just retarded. then going off on rossie o'donneled and the director because its a s&m type movie.  take in to consideration that this movie was made in '94 so rossie wasn't out of the closet fully, and she wasn't a hated fatty yet.  ok so just avert your eyes during her half naked seens or live with it.

now i liked this movie it was a good concept and worth watching for late night TV.  the plot it self gets lost and found and lost and found, so try  to look at it as a movie of finding love.  rather than 2 cops running around an island of s&m looking for a guy with pictures while at the same time chasing murders.  sorry thats the movie didn't mean to ruin it but theres much more to it.  like i said, finding love, the main actor can't find it and goes to this island for what ever reason.  the main actress also can't find it or doesn't relize what she needs is love,  until she actualy falls in love.  the side plots are good and yes it has some funny parts that are really just one liners.  alright well thats all i suggest this movie to others but keep it mind the s&m parts and that its not all s&m more of an utopian island where sex and nakedness and the norm.  like with any movie you like it of you don't!!",1191628800,2,1341,4.03030303030303
637465,3,6303383238,"Firsthand, as a movie in itself, this is [...]. The original novel by Anne Rice titled ""Exit to Eden"" plunged fearlessly into the depths of an alternate sexual lifestyle, bringing S&M from a shady dungeon into the light of an island paradise where people were given the chance to explore and understand their sexual fantasies in a safe and open environment. The journey toward sexual understanding (and understanding of the self) that Lisa the dominatrix, and Elliot, her slave, find themselves on, is at the forefront.

In the film, these two characters take on supporting roles in a version of the story that is embarrassed and uncomfortable with its own premise and uses sad, insecure humor to cover it. Dan Aykroyd and Rosie O'Donnell are brought in as two undercover cops who stand around like a couple of uncomfortable teenagers who have snuck into a sex club, making cheesy, lame jokes about the island and what it is there for. The island itself is reduced to a poofy, kink theme park of masters and slaves who do not delve into their curiosities so much as tiptoe around them, half the time too shy to say the word ""sex."" In other words, if you are interested in S&M or are looking for a movie that does this lifestyle justice, or for that matter makes an interesting speculation on sexuality of any kind, look elsewhere.

The best thing that this movie his to offer is the generous amount of screentime given to hot, naked bodies, earning it the category soft-core porn. Dana Delaney as Lisa(the most unconvincing dominatrix it is humanly possible to imagine) does take her clothes off, and Australian actor Paul Mercurio as Elliot, gives the audience a benevolent number of chances to see his naked [...]. This (for me) is actually the true highlight of the movie, and Mercurio gets naked enough to make it worth watching. The most erotic seen in the film is when Lisa ties up Elliot (or rather, wraps some velvet curtain cords around his hands one or two times) and spanks him with a hairbrush (well it's more like a tap than a spank). Okay, so this is not hardcore S&M by any means, but if you are interested in some soft-core porn and you have a thing for guys' butts (and believe me, Paul Mercurio's is worth seeing) than this movie is definitly worth taking a look at. My advice: speed through the parts with Rosie O'Donnell to get to Paul Mercurio.",1158364800,8,2365,4.64200477326969

I always enjoyed seeing Dana Delany's work and voice work, and this movie captured her in a whole new light. Unlike Live Nude Girls, this focused alot around her so that was a plus for me.

Though I gotta admit the comedy scenes with Dan and Rosie gets a little silly after a while. However about Rosie looking skimpy, I didn't mind at all! She looked pretty good, but if she dressed like that NOW would be kinda scary.

I liked the movie, it's very light porn which I like and some sense of romance between Elliot and Mistress Lisa. And to be blunt, Paul Mercurio was lucky enough to have a scene where he performed oral sex on Dana Delany. One of my biggest desires as well.

637468,1,6303383238,"Great book, horrible movie.  The casting director did a terrible job.  The script writer obviously didn't read the book.  In the immortal words of Comic Book Guy ""Worst Movie Ever"".",1133136000,6,181,4.966666666666667
637525,1,6303383238,"I truthfully believe that I am a generally good person, even though I have never been very religious or had much faith in a God. That is until I saw ""Exit to Eden"". Why, you ask, has ""Exit to Eden"" sparked such an epiphany to my faith. Well, please allow me this chance and I will articulate. You see, upon completion of this film I was given undisputable proof that the devil truly does exist. Now if there, in fact, really is a Lucifer. Then that, in turn, proves that there really is a God, and if this movie is any indication of the wrath he has in store for us when he returns then I, for one, definitely want to get on his good side before that grand event.

I was confused at first because the DVD jewel case, at my local Blockbuster clearly said that this film was a Dramatic Comedy. Once I returned home and put the film in my DVD player I was led to believe that I was watching a horror movie instead. I thought this because through a series of howls and moans, a bloodcurdling character was introduced. This character was so petrifying that it made Jason and Freddy seem like Siegfried and Roy in comparison. In fact, this movie was so disturbing that certain scenes of it should have been used on the tape, from the movie ""The Ring"" to add to the creepiness of it. I asked myself, could the person that rented this film before me have mistakenly put the wrong disc into the ""Exit to Eden"" jewel case? That, in fact, turned out not to be the circumstance. It turns out that the horrifying character previously mentioned was none other than Rosie O'Donnell in a dominatrix outfit, and the howls I heard were the creaks and squeals of every single last fiber, in that outfit trying to surmount the strenuous and unfeasible burden of holding together. Somehow physics and the normal breaking points of the fabrics used were defiyed long enough to get in the required takes.

Let me ask you this. Do you find anything wrong with the following statement: ""Rosie O'Donnell in a dominatrix outfit"", because the casting director obviously did not find anything wrong with it. I can't even begin to contemplate what kind of misbegotten thought process he used to narrow down his final selection to Rosie O'Donnell. I just can't come to grips with the fact that he chose her out of the vast abundance of other Hollywood actresses, most of which, whom are not grossly obese and globe like, to play the role in this movie. Now that I think about it, calling Rosie O'Donnell grossly obese is being very untruthfully kind. Being grossly obese is actually one of her weight loss goals which she will never attain. The NFA (National Film Association) should revoke the casting directors' license for making such an appalling casting choice. Just to be on the safe side he shouldn't even be allowed to cast a vote or even a fishing line for that matter.

This film is based on Anne Rice's very well written erotic novel by the same name. It's a shame that they couldn't capture this in the translation to film. In fact the writers and director (Garry Marshall) acted similar to the body's digestive track. I say this because they took something good (Anne Rice's novel) just like the body takes something good (a Krispy Kream doughnut) and turned it into a steaming pile of $hit.

Dan Aykroyd and Rosie O'Donnell play a pair of undercover detectives that follow a couple of diamonds smugglers onto an erotic fantasy island resort. Rosie O'Donnell's' character was suppose to have a few actions sequences in the film, but they were ultimately cut because they couldn't find a man butch enough to act as her stunt double. Throughout the whole movie I kept waiting for the other three Ghostbusters to join Dan Aykroyd and reenact the closing scene, of their first movie, with Rosie portraying the role of the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man, but alas it did not end up happening. It's a shame because some ion blasting action would have been a very welcomed part to this movie witch cost 150 million dollars to make yet lacked a single special effect. The fact that this movie did not have any CGI or even a single explosion made me wonder just where this 150 million dollars was spent, so I took it upon myself to do a little research. I found out that only 30 million dollars was spent on making the actual movie itself and the remaining 120 million dollars was spent mainly in two other areas. The first of the two areas was for insurance. Apparently the insurance provider claimed that Rosie's' dominatrix outfit was a safety hazard due to the fact that a button or a zipper could erupt at any moment thus projecting shrapnel into one of the cast or crew, and because of that fact, they charged a ridiculously high amount to provide insurance coverage for this film. The second area that used the largest percentage of the budget was the Kraft Food Service. In between takes Rosie would devour so much food that it would make a fully grown Grizzly Bear preparing for a winter long hibernation, look like Calista Flockheart having a small snack on The Richard Simmons Deal A Meal Plan. They had to up security because Rosie had such an assortment of foods and snacks in her movie trailer that several people mistakenly entered it thinking it was a Convenient Store, and started perusing various items that they intended on purchasing.

Men that are not interested in a life of impotence should steer clear of this movie. Rosie O'Donnell has the same effect, on the male reproductive system, as a blistering Hot Tub and a pair of tight fitting underpants. You know how in the Viagra commercials they warn that if you have an erceti0n for over a period of 12 hours you should consult a doctor. Well if this does happen and you do go see a doctor they take you into a private room and show you clips of this movie to resolve the problem.

It turns out that not just the movie was bad but the special features on the disc were bad as well. I listened to the actors audio commentary but all I heard was a constant crackling. I naturally assumed that there was something wrong with the audio track but I continued to listen just in case it fixed itself further into the movie. About half way through the commentary the crackling stopped. I then heard a manly voice, which appeared to be Rosie say ""Hey, do we have any more of these Cheetoes and Honey Mustard Trail Mix?"" and then shortly after the crackling continued once again.

The grisly image of Rosie O'Donnell's exposed body as been burnt into my mind permanently. The sad part is that the wardrobe they selected for her was a very concealing Matrix like leather outfit with a long flowing trench coat, but the abyss of here folds engulfed the majority of it leaving behind only what we saw in the film. I realized that there was only one way to get this nauseating image out of my mind for good. So I slowly walked to my DVD player, ejected the disc, and broke it into four pieces. I took one of the jagged pieces and held it to my right wrist and I was prepared to go on with what would surely rid me of this terror, until I remembered about my new found fear of God and how he so frowned upon suicide. So I apprehensively put down the serrated fragment of disc and was forced to continue living with this haunting image etched in my brain, for the rest of my days. I wrote this review in hopes of perhaps saving even just one person from ending up with the same fate as mine. So please heed this warning and pass this movie onto the bag ladies and the Canadians.",1131408000,,7504,4.493040293040293
637526,5,6303383238,"It's hard to fathom all the outrage and controversy over ""Exit To Eden"", a great sexy comedy that actually lives up to its billing on both counts.  For the record, this a fun, at times farcical (in the very best sense of the word - over-the-top humor based on unlikely but highly comedic incidents) Fantasy - what they call in publishing circles a 'bedtime story for adults' - and it's not - repeat Not - a sadomasochistic film (I hardly think a few quick flicks with a hairbrush counts as being on par with the really depraved stuff).

  A pair of detectives (well played by Dan Akroyd and Rosie O'Donnell) end up going undercover on an island resort after a cartel of thieves.  The island itself is a 'sexual paradise' type getaway reigned over by a 'dominatrix' (although quite a softie of one; as noted this is fun fantasy and not a gritty serious drama) played by the magnificent Dana Delaney.  Guests to the island can opt to be a pseudo-master or pseudo-slave with the other guests.  For all the wild nature of the concept there's a lot of welcome tenderness and characters really falling in love, along with all the welcome unabashed sexuality and exposure (the number of gorgeous girls in here is perhaps second only to ""Dream Trap"", possibly the sexiest movie of all time [And STILL without a DVD release!  Grrrr...:( ], with a giddy air and the best themes of a caper comedy.  If you're lucky enough to get married this is a movie to be taken along on the honeymoon to act out scenes in the privacy of your own honeymoon cabin or suite.  Take along a couple of DiVinyls CDs for the soundtrack too (they're not on the film soundtrack, but my goodness they should have been.  Talk about fitting in well).

637527,5,6303383238,"Don't worry guys, as much as you liked the fact that rosie o'donell didn't get naked you'd be happy to know she doesnt even like men. She's gay and i don't blame her. Next, the resort is not for desperate people, they actually have resorts like that in real life where sexually open people with open minds can go vacation there without being surrounded by narrow minded prude judgemental people that are in the cities we live in. It's like a nude beach, and it's an opportunity given to those people who like to express themselves freely, and people who don't have a problem with their sexuality. That makes you guys hypocrits because remember you're the ones with playboy mag's and strip clubs and pornos. It's amazing how stereotypical men can be. When women express themselves sexually, we're the desperate ones? Yeah ok. Don't think so. But back to the movie. it's a funny flick about two undercover cops trying to locate a couple criminals on an island that is sort of like S & M, bondage type activities and basically whatever you wanna do. My favorite is the dominatrix who is an attractive red headed woman (Dana Delany who was also in the movie tombstone) but anyway it's an ADULT comedy and i use to watch this movie EXIT TO EDEN years ago, and rosie o donell lost a whole bunch of weight to do this movie because she had to wear the leather outfit and strip at a club at the beginning. She isn't even that big BUT whatever. I've seen bigger chicks than her. She's a funny gal and a good actress. But like i said the best character is the dominatrix, and my favorite scene was when she spanked eliot as he was tied up. Her character is very believable and she's a great actress. I didn't mind seeing her naked either. But once again, at least in the movie they tested everyone for std's and they do that in real life also, but men who go out and pick up hollywood hookers is the most desperate act of all, and then they go home and give their wives the diseases and often it's unfortunate when the kids get hiv infected too in a sploppy household when they all share shavers. But as far as this harmless movie, I thought theere was nothing wrong with the resort. It's merely a place where you can go and explore your sexual side because men and women are both sexual beings, and when you're safe about it, no one has any right to judge, especially when you're out in the world doing God only knows what and then pointing fingers at women who have a right to engage in sexual activites also. It's a pot calling the kettle black. Then you wonder why women turn lesbian, it's because of all your little ways guys! We're called nams like slut, and desperate if we go to strip joints or watch pornos. It's a sad stereotypical world we live in where men are hung up on notions that pornos are for men to j*rk off too, and that women aren't suppose to watch them. Open your eyes, we have sexual desires too! And now after reading my post you're probably labeling me a gay feminist but i'm not, it's the world. Everyone is so brainwashed. To each his or her own.

As far as Rosie, geez it sounds like you guys have a sexual obsession with her subconsciously because the dude that wrote about her in his review sounds to me like you need some therapy to get over her. When someone is that obsessed and makes comments about how much he or she is disgusted, it sounds like an overreacting exaggeration, kinda like some homo-phobes who are actually gay but subconsiously aren't out of the closet yet. And also, be careful what you say about people you don't know, if peopple aren't your type so be it, but alot of these whiny p*ssy boys on amazon  complaining about rosie than don't watch it! get over it lol. It's such an exaggeration about her leather dominatrix outfit and her weight. She looked fine in the outfit! You're just so brainwashed about women's figures, not everyone is anorexic and a size 1. She may be a little chubby but all this hate and judging won't getcha anywhere in life. Also rosie is a good person. She helps out children in need, and has done many charities and donations. And as far as the ""she's so annoying"" comments. You have a right to your opinion but that's her personality, and her accent in this movie gave her a big city attitude, and that was her character, she was suppose to be spunky and funny. And if you really wanna know why they put her in the leather outfit, basically to shock the narrowminded world, and it was only meant to be humorous, and to show that she had the balls to do it, despite her size which isn't even that huge. I use to have a friend that was 2 times bigger. And after rosie came out and said she was gay even though many thought so before hand, her reason was she didn't ""TRUST MEN"" and every woman can understand that. And as for this being a porno, no, not even. Some nudity, only one sexually explicit scene that only lasted 30 seconds. You'd think that this day and age people would be more tolerant when it comes to sex. Sex is not a big deal unless you're a religious fanatic, prude, or a nun, then you don't have to watch this type of movie. And for the person who said whoever liked this movie is sick and twisted. Maybe one day when you're all grown up you'll understand what we adults consider humorous and entertainment until then go to the children's section at your local video store.",1119744000,6,5361,4.381526104417671

I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. There is a lot of nudity, so PLEASE do not let the children walk in while you're watching. It had a good bit of romance and that was the lovely part. You have Dan, who was scared of sex, and after viewing the goings-on at Eden, decides to step up his game, so to speak.

637529,3,6303383238,"To do that, watch Exit to Eden. As the review on Amazon.com said, the movie seems to be confused on which direction it should go....the comedy route, or a serious straight movie with plenty of erotica.

I, for one, didn't really remember the plot. I was more concern about the potential beefcakes in the film. I do vaugely remember that Paul Mercurio had to hide out on this island while being hunted by Iman, and that he like being spanked.

For a movie that boasts tons of half naked women and speedo claded men, you'd think that everyone of every sexual persuasion would be panting after this flick.

Not so. Based on an Anne Rice novel, which I haven't read, but I am pretty sure was infinitely erotic and probably more funny, Exit to Eden misfire on almost all levels. The main problem is that it is played (perhaps unintentionally) as a comedy...and sex and comedy usually do not mix...and thus diluting any hints of the erotic that the film might want to convey.

The very first scene smack of kiddie porn of a young Paul Mercurio being spanked by his mother (and thus turning him on). That already put a damper on my anticipation of the film.

Dana Delany came across more uptight and sexually repressed than a nun...and here we are suppose to believe that she is this dominatrix who preside over this island of hedonism, designing these weird naughty outfits.

Speaking of outfits, the gold briefs and bikinis the ""natives"" wore was not flattering at all, making everybody looking they stepped out of a cheesy 1980s rollerblading boogie woogie flick.

And don't even mention Rosie O'Donnell....shoehorned into a black tight leather outfit which threatened to burst at the seam at any moment. If you can suspend your disbelief that virginal Dana Delany rule over this island of sin, you have to do it again to believe a hunky blond CEO of a major corporation is panting after Rosie O.

Exit to Eden had the potential to be an effective erotic thriller, but unfortunately it seems that director Gary Marhsall is a bit squeamish and uncomfortable around the subject of sex and so he toss in some cheap yuks...which didn't quite work.

I for one, often complain how guys in the movies nowadays do not show enough skin. Watching Exit to Eden somehow make me wish otherwise.

In the final analysis, the movie shouldn't be called Exit to Eden. Wherever it exited is someplace I'd rather not be.",1103328000,6,2396,4.683333333333334
637530,4,6303383238,"The good news about this film is that a lot of pretty girls take their clothes off (including the luscious Dana Delany).  The better news is that Rosie O'Donnell does NOT take her clothes off.  Along the way we get a tour of an island paradise for D/S perverts anonymous that could only come from the mind of Ann Rice.

The plot revolves around a pair of LA cops [O'Donnell & Dan Akroyd]  who go undercover(s?) at a resort for the sexually depraved (and perhaps the sexually deprived as well?).  Of course, this is all taking for granted that the LAPD has jurisdiction beyond the LA city limits.  What they're going undercover for is convoluted & you'll have to see the movie to find out.

The movie is categorized as a loose comedy, although the only funny scenes are the ones with Dan Akroyd.  Rosie O'Donnell tries to be funny but, as usual, she falls short.  I've always found her to be annoying, and this movie did nothing to change that perception.  I'd say that the movie would have been better had they cut out half her lines.  The balance of the film is basically a drama, albeit an absurd one.

That said, if you enjoy movies that are semi-fun and full of nudity, this one may be worth checking out.  It is not a great movie by any means, but it's not bad.  If it didn't have Dana Delany it would probably not be worth your time.  With Dana Delany the value of this DVD goes up tremendously.",1095638400,22,1401,4.355212355212355

However it did so poorly in audience testing, that they brought in Dan Adroyd and Rosie O'Donnel for post-production, AND MADE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIE!! You can tell because the four principals are together only in the end scene. But this effort only confuses and destroys whatever had existed of the original themes. I would be interested to see the original version that followed Anne Rice's book.",1059350400,9,551,4.810526315789474

637534,3,6303383238,"I have to admit that I really can not judge Exit to Eden properly. On one hand, I was very much disappointed by what Gary Marshall has managed to do, turning a serious study of a dark and complex aspect of human sexuality, and one of the most misunderstood, SM relationships, and turning it into a farce! On the other hand the presence of the gorgeous Dana Delany playing the part of the Mistress to near perfection makes it a must buy. I have to say that my appreciation of gorgeous women got the better of the cinematic critic and lover in me, and I ended up buying the film!!
I don't have a problem with the film per se, although Marshall is a mediocre director at best (his best films as director are Princess Diaries and the setimentally drenched Pretty Woman but still no masterpieces),and the whole film is watchable.
Maybe the subject was too taboo to be filmed as intended, so making it a light comedy with some known talented comedians like Ackroyd and O'Donnel, will take some of the heat off, and turn it into a mainstream movie. It needs lots of courage and and an adventurous director and producer to remake Jaeckin's Stoy of O or Shroeder's Maitresse these days, and the closest film that came close to seriously study SM relationships on screen recently is the Korean art house (ie little seen) film Lies,(not forgetting the 'painfully' unwatchable British comedy Preaching to the Perverted( with a delightfully 'kinky' Guinevere Turner as the 'Mistress')
 Now back to Exit to Eden, the other saving grace of the movie, is the casting except maybe for Paul Mercurio. He is not a bad actor, yet the way his character was portrayed in the film is quite disappointing. His attitude towards this whole experience is kind of 'I don't belong here and I don't like these 'games' one bit but I am here anyway to seduce the chief 'Mistress'..which made me think 'what are you doing here in the first place??!! A bit annoying.
So Exit To Eden can be more enjoyed if you forget Anne Rice's book for a moment, and just watch it as a lighthearted comedy with Dana Delany as sexy as she ever was,(hence my three stars) baring in the process more than she ever did in any of her roles.
The DVD is of excellent quality and the making of segment is interesting, esp Dana Delany's interview expressing her enjoyment at playing this character, which was very sexy!.
So if anything, get this movie if you like Dana Delany, and if you don't mind a bit of ligth fantasy on the side..",1054425600,8,2477,4.541387024608501
637575,1,6303383238,"After turning Pretty Woman from a dark story about prostitution into a romantic comedy, Gary Marshall tried the same tack with Anne Rice's nasty little novel about sexual obsession.  Well,  he made a movie that is neither erotic nor funny.  Worse, it feels split down the middle, and needlessly overplotted in order to merge the two sides.
This film comes from the vast middle period of bad Dan Ackroyd films--put it in the same batch as Dragnet. Sometimes dumb and clumsy isn't funny, it's just dumb and clumsy, like a bloated uncle left to watch the kids after Thanksgiving dinner--which begs the question, when did Ackroyd give up on being sharp-edged?",1048377600,5,655,4.882882882882883
637576,5,6303383238,"First, a caveat: if you liked the Anne Rice novel this film is loosely based on, you probably won't like the film.
<I>Exit to Eden</I> is a wonderful, lighthearted introduction to the world of BDSM. Unlike Rice's novel, the BDSM in the film is realistic, and the viewer is introduced to elements of real-life BDSM like safewords, mutual consent, and commitment to safety, that most BDSM fiction sorely lacks.
The casting was inspired, particularly of Dana Delany, Rosie O'Donnell, and Paul Mercurio, who like the people i play with are real people behind the leather facade.
Those who are seriously into the scene might find this movie a little tame, with only a couple of real scenes and ""bondage"" that can easily be escaped from. But the curious will find it a safe and unthreatening introduction to a very real and viable lifestyle. The scene with Lisa, Elliot, and the hairbrush rang very true on an emotional level--and i don't care what anyone says, the scene with Elliot in Mistress Lisa's bath was HOT.
There are only a few complaints i would make. Unlike the real BDSM community (or the novel), there's no hint of homoeroticism in the film. The real-life scene is very pansexual, with people of all orientations sharing space. And the casting of Richard was terrible. Most of all, i wish a lot more screen time had been devoted to Lisa's relationship with Diana, whose heady mix of intimacy and formal role has been an inspiration for my own relationship.
But those are very minor complaints. Overall it's a delightful film, one i've watched again and again over the years. If i were ever to come out to my family about being into BDSM, i would start with having them watch this movie.",1019606400,37,1694,4.726351351351352
637577,1,6303383238,"just by looking at the cover I could tell that this movie would be nothing like the book. I was wondering how they would be able to make it into a non X rated movie and still include the best parts and points. Well they did do one thing, they made it into a non X rated movie but they put ROSIE O'DONNELL in it! they turned it into a comedy! Why? why? why? it was a good book! if your idea of improvement is to turn a perfectly good story into [junk] then just leave it alone.",1015632000,6,476,3.86734693877551

I was totally shocked to see Rosie dressed the way she is in this movie and I was just cracking up laughing. Not really at the movie itself, but the expression on Rosie's face. If you know Rosie, you know she is very uncomfortable with her body so to have her in this situation it's a miracle she could go through with it. Why isn't this movie on DVD? I want to buy it but won't until I can have the DVD.",1014422400,,527,3.8
637579,5,6303383238,"Ok, if you're looking for a good Anne Rice adaptation, stick to Interview with the Vampire since about all they kept from Rice's text were the names. If you are looking for a good comedy this is one to consider if you're open minded.
The story centers around an ""kinky"" sex resort in which people go to fufil fantasies surrounding Sadomasochism (SM), Bondage/Discipline (BD), and Dominance/Submission (DS). Interwoven into this plot is a diamond smuggler out to kill plot which makes the film rather amusing.
The cast of main characters is excellent. Dana Delaney portrays a young mistress who is terrified to step outside that role in reality. Paul Mercurio plays an Australian hunk who is getting in touch with his sexual desires and is hesitant to cross the threshold into that realm and admit he likes it. Rosie O'Donnel is an excellent cop with a nice wit and always ready to take a shot at with whomever. Aykroyd's character can be annoying at times, but he is fun to watch. The gong says it all.
Props an costuming are excellent. The whips are provided by Hartwood Whips of Passion and unfortunatly were never used on anyone durng filming (their loss). Rosie O'Donnel gets a chance to show us a rare side and put on some ""bondage"" clothing. What is nice is she manages to do it very well for a woman who isn't an emaciated gerbil like some of the other twigs we see on the screen.
If you are looking for a cutting edge comedy, go somewhere else. If you are looking for a comedy that is genuinely funny within its context, this is one you should consider checking out.",1013990400,2,1574,4.585106382978723

637581,4,6303383238,"I truly loved the movie, mainly because I have an almost childish crush on Dana Delany. I have a weakness for red hair anyway, and the scenes where she is shown coming out of the swimming pool made me so passionate for her, but depressed because it`s only a movie.  I have almost all of the episodes of China Beach on tape that were recently shown on the History Channel, as well as the movie Live Nude Girls, and have tapes of all the Pasadena series thus far.  Fate would be unbelievable for me to get to meet her but would love to have the chance to talk about my lingering visits to Cheshire, Naugatuck, and New London, Connecticut, and perhaps Fishers Island, N.Y. via the Groton Ferry.

I was pleased to see that it doesn't take itself as seriously (all the time) as some viewers expected.  Lighten up, y'all!  Equating a fairly mild fetish (at least as presented here, with glamourized sugar-coating and wink-wink-nudge-nudge abounding) with a serious ""Alternative Lifestyle Choice"" is just pompous.

Though not a definitive version of Anne Rice's original book, the movie serves it just about as well as a commercial film could. The SM scenes are toned down, but are hardly forgotten, and are treated with sympathy and imagination.
The detective subplot, added for the film, is strong and humorous. Ackroyd (often unbearable) does well, and O'Donnell is quite strong--and funny--and sympathetic.
The film does not cast judgement on its subject matter, nor does in impel that judgement on the viewer.
Mercurio has that brilliance we have come to expect after ""Strictly Ballroom.""

637637,3,6303383238,"OK...let's get right to the point.  This movie is not for the easily embarrassed and definitely not for children.  It is funny and unexpected...at least at first viewing...and that makes it well worth seeing at least one time.
The movie falters in that the director cannot make up his mind: is this a comedy?  is this a thriller?  is this soft porn?  The lack of a consistent target leaves the viewer rather disoriented.
Still...(and I read the bondage person's opinion earlier in the list of reviews)...the hairbrush scene is NOT TYPICAL for standard American films.  My wife and I saw it first in a theater (on the first or second day of release), and there was NOT A SOUND during that scene...and I stole a quick enough glance around to see that everyone was glued to screen.  Not too common an event for this sort of film.
Finally...those of you who don't want to see an average sized woman in skimpy outfits need a reality check...Not everyone is a size 4 with plastic-surgeon enhanced breasts.
