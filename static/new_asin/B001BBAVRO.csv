8282540,5,B001BBAVRO,The video is of good quality - my son wants to watch Miffy every day!  The video is just long enough.,1376265600,,101,3.8095238095238093
8282541,5,B001BBAVRO,This dvd is great.  We just love Miffy!  Miffy can do no wrong.  We have every Miffy dvd there is.,1316736000,,98,3.8
8282542,4,B001BBAVRO,"When my son was 2+ he loved watching Miffy on Noggin. Then Miffy went away. I was happy to find the videos to introduce my other son & daughter.. only to find my 6 year old watching right along. Nice, simple scenes. No fresh talk or violence. Always a little lesson. Miffy is a must-have for a calming element in our house. Aaah. Only negative - can get boring after a while for kids. Reccomend one or two episodes at a time.",1294704000,,425,4.195121951219512
8282543,5,B001BBAVRO,"I love that this is a bare bones DVD. It doesn't repeat the theme song over and over after and or before each episode, which makes viewing much easier and nicer. My daughter loves it, and I have to admit that I enjoy watching it with her. Very cute little show!",1288828800,,261,4.137254901960785
8282544,3,B001BBAVRO,"Older son loved Miffy, wanted younger one to be able to enjoy it too.  Language is clear and simple storylines.  Dvd is easy play with good episodes.  Only disadvantage is that theme song does not play at start of each episode, and we loved the song.",1276560000,,250,4.391304347826087
8282545,5,B001BBAVRO,"This is about the sweetest video I've ever seen.  Miffy is very, very cute. This is not political, not religious, not violent, not trying to sell the kids anything--just good sweet, fun for toddlers (3-5).  You can plop them in front of this for half an hour with almost no guilt.",1262217600,2,280,4.470588235294118
8282546,5,B001BBAVRO,"As my daughter watches this right now... I have to say that all the Miffy products we have purchased (books, videos, dolls, etc) have been wonderful.  Miffy is an innocent, sweet character that models appropriate behavior and caring.  There are always situations where she learns a lesson, or just learns about something in the world around her (like nature).  The production on these videos is slow-moving, as one other reviewer mentioned, but definitely not boring for children.  There is a heavy focus on the story-telling, which is perfect for children who are starting to learn about a storyline in books.  I recommend any Miffy to parents of toddlers who are concerned about the regular production of children's shows where there is too much flashing images, lack of plot, and lack of appropriate behavior from characters that children will emulate.",1232841600,8,855,5.122302158273381
8282547,5,B001BBAVRO,"This is a bare bones DVD with no bonus features and no activity bumpers in between shorts. There are no previews to wade through, and the disc auto plays in its entirety after a 10-second countdown displayed onscreen. At 12 shorts and 51 minutes total running time, it's a better value than the first two Peace Arch DVD releases (9 shorts each) and includes some shorts not previously available on US DVD. Episode listing:

1. Miffy and the Three Christmas Trees
2. Miffy and the Snowbunny
3. Snuffy's Winter Fun
4. Miffy Goes Skiing
5. Miffy and Aggie's Teddy Bears
6. Miffy's Colorful World
7. Miffy has the Flu
8. Miffy Worries About Snuffy
9. Miffy Plays Doctor
10. Miffy's Teddy Bear Is Sick
11. Miffy's Rainy Day
12. Miffy's Snowfall",1226793600,11,739,4.641221374045801
