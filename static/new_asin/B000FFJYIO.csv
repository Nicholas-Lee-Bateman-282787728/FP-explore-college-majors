8121777,5,B000FFJYIO,"I cant say enough good things about this show. Here's the next three episodes of the series and it just gets better. You get to learn more about the characters and the story line gets deeper. As does the complex of the relationships gets deeper. as all good shows do it brings you in closer into the show and makes you feel like you want to be in the show going along with drew, sherry, and everyone else. Be sure to check out my review on dvd 1 of the series for more details bout the show. Buy this and you won't regret it one bit.",1227312000,4,533,4.037735849056604
