2064198,5,B00026L74U,"Marcel Carn's PORT OF SHADOWS (Le Quai des Brumes) belongs to the list of movies we had to see in school in the seventies. This film is part of the French cultural heritage and was regularly showed by the film clubs of our schools. Some of the greatest actors of that period appear in PORT OF SHADOWS : Jean Gabin, THE unquestionable star of French cinema from the beginning of the 30's until the beginning of the 70's, Michle Morgan who attained a cult status with this film she shot while she was 17 years old, the Swiss actor Michel Simon (Zabel) who portrayed numerous unforgettable characters during his long career on the screen (1924-1975), Pierre Brasseur who's excellent as Lucien the hoodlum.

Great actors and also great dialogues written by Jacques Prvert, a poet-artist often associated with the Poetic Realism genre of that period. Lines as ""Tu as de beaux yeux, tu sais"" (You do have beautiful eyes, you know) or ""Vite, on est press"" (Hurry, we don't have much time left) said by Gabin to Morgan are sentences you don't easily forget if you happen to like PORT OF SHADOWS.

Yes, a few frames of the moody cinematography are worth watching, but you can see one of them for free on the box art.  If you like watching high speed artistic train wrecks in super slow motion, then this is the movie for you.

2064200,4,B00026L74U,"I first became aware of director Marcel Carne when I saw ""Children of Paradise"". In a review I wrote on here for that movie I said to call it a masterpiece is to understate it's case. The same can be said for ""Port of Shadows"", easily one of the greatest films I have ever seen.

 The movie stars Jean Gabin as a soldier running away from the past. What exactly did he do? I don't know, we get the hint he must be a deserter, but maybe that's just the beginning of his problems. Whatever the case may be it doesn't matter. All that matters is the fact he wants to get away. Jean (that's his character's name) finds himself in a hideout run by a man called Panama (Edouard Delmont) which is near what is known as ""the port of shadows"". Here is where Jean will get all the help he needs to leave the country. But things are never that easy. For instance he meets a girl, Nelly (Michele Morgan) and gets mixed up with criminals; Zabel (Michel Simon) and Lucien (Pierre Brasseur). And soon Jean fears he may be a suspect in a murder.

 Jean Gabin is an absolute natural for a role like this. He practically invented the character in ""Pepe le Moko"". A character that American actors such as Humphrey Bogart would play in films like ""Casablanca"". Gabin has those rough edges around his face and a dour look on his face that leads us to believe the guy has been through a lot. This is a complete contrast to the look Michele Morgan has. She is to put bluntly a beauty!

 The film was based on a novel written by Pierre Mac Orlan and was adapted by Jacques Prevert (a poet as well as songwriter. If you are familiar with the song ""Autumn Leaves"" he wrote the lyrics). I've never read the book so I cannot comment on how faithfully this film is adapted, but I can say Carne does a masterful job directing this movie. The film takes us down paths I wasn't expecting to travel. Carne doesn't throw too much in our face. He lets the story flow at it's own pace. And things move along quite quickly. The film is only 90 minutes. But at the same time, nothing feels rushed. We understand these characters, their situations and the fate that awaits them. Having only seen two films from this director I'm ready to call him a master. His films manage to touch me on a deep personal level. He creates characters that seems to live off the page. And just think, this was Carne's third film! He clearly had a natural gift. And luckily people took notice during his lifetime. ""Port of Shadows"" won the National Board of Review award for ""Best Foreign Film"".

 As for the film's title, at first I wondered how they arrived at it. We don't find out the name of the port until the end of the film but couldn't it have a double meaning? Couldn't the ""port of shadows"" refer to a place where people go looking to escape the shadows of their past? Or maybe it's just that you can't see a darn thing with all that fog hanging around!

 Bottom-line: Marcel Carne's film is one of the greatest I have ever see. Carne handles the story and the characters with a sure touch. The movie takes some unexpected turns and takes what could have been a simple story and transcends it into something much more.",1143331200,7,3171,4.3322091062394605
2064201,4,B00026L74U,"French cinema reached its Golden Age in the 1930s with directors like Jean Vigo, Julien Duvivier, Jean Renoir, and of course Marcel Carn.  While Quai des Brumes certainly lacks the romantic spark of L'Atalante or the striking presence of La Grande Illusion, it does have others things going for it, such as wittily profound dialogue and a marvelous aura of prewar continental malaise.  The plot seems a little too similar to Pepe Le Moko, but Jean Gabin carries the load quite well, making it worth the ride again.  The supporting cast, including Michel Simon (Passion of Jean of Arc, L'Atalante) as Zabel the creepy godfather and Pierre Brassuer (Les Enfants du Paradis) as Lucien the weasely gangster are both very good as well.  And the foggy scenes filmed over the port city of Le Havre provide a perfect visual aid to the gritty poetic realism of the storyline.

Regarding the Criterion DVD, there are only English subtitles, no other languages.  The only extras are a fun French trailer and a set of stills with comments which are somewhat interesting.  The video quality is really no better than the VHS tape, but at least they have made it available for us on DVD.  The price is still too high of course but at least it has come down lower than their earlier titles.",1091232000,14,1274,4.707207207207207
2064202,5,B00026L74U,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was one of the saddest and most beautiful films I'd ever seen, which I still think today. The fugitive, the melancholic painter, the abused girl, the ship, and the dog, oh yes, the dog will break your heart and duly so. This was the kind of movie Marcel Carn&eacute; used to make, sad and beautiful, effortless, peerless, unforgettable. He later made Children of Paradise, which is far more ambitious than Port of Shadows in narrative and production terms and although Children of Paradise is usually considered his greatest film, I'd be hard pressed to tell which of the two is more ravishing. Children is a luxurious opera; Port is a mesmerizing chamber piece.",1090886400,27,703,4.770491803278689
2064203,5,B00026L74U,"Jean (Jean Gabin), a deserting soldier, emerges out the darkness as an approaching truck's lights cut through the night. The truck driver offers Jean a ride which he gladly accepts as he is weary from his long journey away from his dark past in the French military, a past that Jean wants to escape as it brings him pain and anxiousness, which haunts his restless mind. Weariness and dreadful memories brings Jean into a foggy world where he drifts between sleep and awareness while the truck is traveling in the direction of the French port city of Le Havre, which is equally foggy and full of threats.

Hopeful, Jean arrives to Le Havre where he intends to find a new beginning to his life, and where he can discard his past. A port city offers several opportunities for a person such as Jean to embark on new journeys as the port is full of ships leaving each day for new destinations. Through the help of some strangers that Jean meets at a worn down tavern he begins to find a light, which could help guide him back on track to a new life. However, the fog remains as Jean's destiny has different plans for him as his good nature seems to affect the people he meets.

Port of Shadows is a poetic visualization of a realistic story, which Carne gave a magic touch to by using visual signs to enhance the cinematic experience. These signs have a symbolic value for the audience as it offers cerebral participation in the film, which can be pondered for some time. The symbolism of the fog and use of a port city has a profound effect on the films cinematic value as it may causes some cognitive dissonance as both coexist and could be associated with opposite notions. An example of this symbolic antagonism for the fog and the port is the freedom of a port and the barrier of the fog. An analogy can be drawn the antagonism between the fog and the port to Jean's ambiguous character who is good, yet capable of violence.

Port of Shadows is a powerful film based on a novel by Pierre Mac Orlan that does not leave anyone untouched regardless of background or creed. The story depicts elements of human ambiguity, crime, and love, which is elevated with brilliant cinematography and direction. The cinematography uses several close-ups and zoom-outs in order to bring the characters feelings to the audience, which enhances the visual experience of the excellent cast. In the end the audience will have experienced a most brilliant cinematic event.",1090713600,33,2451,4.629885057471264
2064204,5,B00026L74U,"Marcel Carne made Le quai de brumes in 1939. And you know what I mean with it.
In fact the film turns around a dock and an expected voyage ; the last detail for get the happiness between two lovers, but the long arm of the fate will avoid the deserved happy ending.
Carne and Prevert made a succesful couple and even a weird agreement in the whole structure of several films.

It's fundamental for you , if you're really interested as me about the Carne films watch the first of greatful movies abou this film maker, because you'll find out in this one some vital clues that will feed the following works.
Jean Cocteau was emerging also but with a clear difference , the approach of this poet is filled by the mythological rapture translated to the modern times.
Back to Carne , I have in my personal collections the most remarkable films of Carne.
If you watch Le jour se leve , by instance , isolatedly from the whole poetic context , you may easily to make a mistake about the meaning of this.
All the great authors and artists develop a solid structure thta grows progressively with his grow up process. Beethoven,  Michelangelo , Shakespeare or William Blake are consistent examples who define the significance of this issue.
Obviously , Carne is an universe in himself . You'll watch Paris as a background who will permeate your soul , due the evident contrast between the beauty locations of this city light and the clouds of fate that surround the characters , the love is expressed to such high poetic levels , that the world who wants avoid the deserved triumph is an unconscious part of the dark fate.

2064205,4,B00026L74U,"Very much akin to Visconti's Ossessione made a few years later, Le Quai Des Brumes is a typically French noirish portrayal of the underbelly of society, with superb Jean Gabin in the role of a disillusioned Foreign Legion deserter torn apart between fleeing the country for good and defending his romantic interest from a host of seedy underworld characters.

8022947,5,B00026L74U,"I think I'm in love with Jean Gabin.  He was honestly one of the finest actors of his generation, maybe the finest.  Next to James Cagney, they made for some of the most memorable performances I've seen in film made in the 30's and 40's and they continue to astonish me the more I see of their filmographies.  1939 was kind to both of them, with Cagney delivering different yet equally impressive performances in `The Roaring Twenties' and `Each Dawn I Die', but it was Gabin who owned this year with two astonishing performances, one in `Le Jour Se Leve' and the other in this masterpiece film; `Port of Shadows'.

In Port of Shadows, Gabin plays Jean, a military deserter who finds himself slumming in Le Havre seeking out a way to `start over'.  He meets the beautiful Nelly, but soon finds himself swallowed up in her world, which is anything but kind.  Stuck with a lustful guardian and an arrogant gangster boyfriend, Nelly is bad news for Jean, but he Jean is determined and sadly underprepared for all that he is about to face.

Visually, this French noir is absorbing.  The fog lifts in all the right places and settles down at the right times, leaving us entranced by all that is unraveling on screen.  Marcel Carne beautifully crafts this masterpiece with intimate details that keep it earnest and realistic, getting the small nuances right and keeping us glued to the eventualities we don't want to see coming.  But at the end of the day, it is up to Jean Gabin to sell us on every frame, and he does.  He grounds Jean in this mystery, this ambiguity and yet he never comes off as a ghost or an enigma entirely.  Instead, he understands the importance of adding a depth behind the eyes that betrays his physical actions.  Watching his eyes (Gabin is possibly one of the best examples of `acting with your eyes' in the history of film acting) just takes you by surprise.  You can see the wide array and inner emotions and complex shifts without seeing any dramatics.  You see him love, lust, morn, regress and pursue all by watching those subtle changes in his stare.

Possibly the single greatest performance of the 30's.

So, when all is said and done, `Port of Shadows' nails everything it strives for.  In a year that brought us some of the best films history has provided, `Port of Shadows' stands tall as one of the very, very best.",1357516800,4,2349,4.56563245823389
8022948,1,B00026L74U,Slow and non-eventful even for a Euro film. Goes on and on then finally something happens at half way point then something at the end. I like good Euro films but this is a low point.,1327363200,,182,4.083333333333333
8022949,5,B00026L74U,"After watching Children of Paradise, the 1945 film written by Jacques Prvert and directed by Marcel Carn, I felt that I had seen one of the most beautiful films ever made and was intrigued by what else Carn's filmography had to offer. I decided to follow up that film up with this film, also written by Prvert and based on a novel by Pierre Mac Orlan. Port of Shadows, released in 1938, is the first masterpiece by Carn and is one of the great hidden gems of cinema.

Jean (Jean Gabin) is a military deserter who stumbles into the fog-shrouded town of Le Havre, looking to get out of the country. The foggy landscape is an atmospheric foreshadowing of what will unfold for the characters. Jean, who finds himself accompanied by a small dog (one of the most loyal, loveable canine's I've seen on film), finds shelter in a shack at the edge of the water where he meets 17-year-old Nelly (Michle Morgan). Nelly comes with her own personal baggage, including a missing boyfriend, a shady godfather named Zabel (Michel Simon), and a local hood named Lucien. Intending to depart the following day on a ship to Venezuela, Jean falls for Nelly despite the obstacles standing in their way.

Port of Shadows is so terrific on nearly every level it's unfathomable to me that someone could not like it. There are people who hold foreign films and/or black & white films in disdain, but even such biased viewers should find something here that appeals to them. Besides being just masterful on a cinematic level, it's actually very entertaining with scenes scattered throughout that range from tense to exciting to comedic to romantic. In one of its many great scenes, Jean confronts Lucien for harassing Nelly and it's one of those scenes that is so masculine it makes you want to cheer.

Jean Gabin has the look of an average guy, but what a talent he was! I haven't seen many of his films, but his performance as Jean is terrific. He's playing a multi-faceted character who is mysterious, tough, romantic, and charming; all qualities which Gabin conveys splendidly. That's not to overlook the great work by Simon or the great character actors that appear throughout the film, nor the elegant performance of the then-18-year-old Morgan; but Gabin is an actor whose work I look forward to seeing more of.

As with Children of Paradise, the dialogue in Port of Shadows is pure poetry and some of the most beautiful dialogue I've heard in film. Carn's most well-known films are grouped into the sub-genre of ""poetic realism"" and his directing and the brilliant writing by Prvert seems like such a brilliant marriage. Through elegant photography (by Eugen Schfftan), an ethereal directorial style, and beautiful writing, together Carn and Prvert were able to evoke such poetic beauty through a sublime marriage of images and words. Port of Shadows isn't brought up much in discussions of the greatest films ever made, but from watching it just a single time I believe it may be one of the greatest films I've ever seen with an explosive final scene that is as beautiful and moving as a finale can get. Few films entertain and move me this way and it's one of the few films I wanted to watch again the moment it ended. When I do re-visit this film sometime in the near future, I will re-vise my review accordingly but this is where I stand now. It's an achingly beautiful masterpiece that is nothing short of brilliant.

This brings me to the Criterion release of the film that has recently gone out-of-print. This is one of the more disappointing Criterion releases I've seen due to the varying state of the picture quality. There are times when it looks crisp, pristine, and stunningly beautiful but then there are significant patches of the film that are of VHS quality. I swear one scene had what appeared to be the outline of a film negative beneath the shot. It's certainly not up to par with most Criterion DVD releases. With that said, I am not ungrateful that Criterion released this and I find it to be a great tragedy (and no, I'm not overstating it) that the film has gone out-of-print. I don't own this film and it's lack of availability is tragic for not just myself, but film lovers everywhere. This film deserves a larger audience and those who want to see it will have to save their money and buy an overpriced copy, the same thing that I must do to see it again.

8022950,5,B00026L74U,"In ""Le quai des brumes"" (""Port of Shadows"") (1939) a black and white film noir crime/ drama/romance/thriller, and another bleak classic of French cinema, the extraordinary French director Marcel Carne (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Paradise-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005T30I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Paradise - Criterion Collection</a>)  teams once again with that extraordinary French actor Jean Gabin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Illusion-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780020707/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection</a>) to give us a film you won't soon forget.  The script was written by Jacques Prevert, Carne's frequent collaborator, based on a novel by Pierre Mac Orlan.

As the film opens, we see Jean (Gabin), an army deserter, traveling down a desolate, fog-bound, tree lined road to the port city of LeHavre.  The protocol of French cinema between the world wars was supposed to be ""poetic realism,"" but, frankly, this magnificent long opening shot looks more like German expressionism to me, as do the shots of ""Panama's"" shack, where Jean takes refuge, on an empty beach that looks a lot like the end of the world.  Jean  must leave metropolitan France - that's what he's doing in Le Havre, but at Panama's, he meets the gorgeous 17-year old Nelly, played by the everlastingly beautiful, high cheek-boned, Michele Morgan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passage-to-Marseille/dp/B000JC0QNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passage to Marseille </a>).  And he finds it very difficult to leave her.  Following on the deaths of her parents, Nelly has found herself the ward of Zabel, played by Michel Simon,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boudu-Saved-from-Drowning-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0009WIE2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boudu Saved from Drowning - (The Criterion Collection)</a>C),  a successful shopkeeper and vendor of souvenirs of the town, who also loves her, and yearns for her charms.  Conflict ensues, of course, and Jean finds that no good deed of his goes unpunished, as he unwittingly, unwillingly, becomes front-page news in the town.  The acting is fine, the company rounded out by a passel of one-named actors, presumably from the Comedie Francaise.

The photography is marvelously detailed and moody; the original score by Maurice Jaubert adds greatly to the atmosphere of the film, and Nelly is appropriately dressed in a wardrobe by the unaccredited Coco Chanel.  Carne, of course, managed to make ""Les Enfants"" during the World War II German Occupation of France: it hints at many things that would have angered the German censors, had they realized the undertones were there.  And Gabin?  Of working class birth - born in Montmartre, Paris, he had a particular gift for playing the working class anti-hero, the soft-hearted tough guy. A deservedly enduring film and a must-see.",1283212800,4,3023,6.411330049261084
8022951,4,B00026L74U,"Marcel Carne is well known for directing Children of Paradise, a quaint but inoffensive film that's actually mediocre. Quai des Brumes (Port of Shadows) is a little long-winded at times, perhaps too poetic, but it so effectively captures the pessimistic mood of pre-war France. And it's always great to watch Gabin in a good role, slapping around some malcontent while scoring with the female lead. He is superb. Some reviewers have criticized the role of the drunk and yes, it is a bit over the top, but this really is nitpicking. Quai des Brumes with all its flaws is still one of Carne's best.",1229731200,3,596,4.740384615384615

8022953,4,B00026L74U,"An example of poetic realism, the French film movement (atmosphere would be more precise) between WWI and WWII, Port of Shadows is heavy on coincidence beginning, arguably, with the truck driver who transports Jean, the Jean Gabin character (and us) into the film.  Jean hasn't eaten for two days and is given free food by an innkeeper; he meets a girl and the attraction is mutual; he needs new clothes and a passport so an artist commits suicide and leaves both to him, etc.

All of this would make for a predictable run-of-the-mill thing except for the fact that there is more than coincidence going on here and that the coincidences themselves are in many ways of little concern to the point of the film.  Indeed, it seems that the filmmakers used coincidence as a way of dispensing with nettlesome plot necessities in order to focus more intently on what they wanted the film to convey.  What it does convey, and quite nicely, is the sense of impending doom, a haunted past (Jean is a deserter who seems to harbor darker secrets in his past), the venality and corruptability of man, love gained and lost, and the futility of daily life when stacked against all of that.  Hardly a sunny romp in the woods (somehow the fog seems to linger even in bright sunlight), but an entertaining film nonetheless.

Aside from the coincidences and the atmosphere, another interesting aspect is the way in which the Gabin character exits outside of society.  A deserter (and one sense that he joined the army only a way to escape some former social unit), he has left behind that society in search of, not really another one, but perhaps a way to live outside any society at all, at least until he meets the girl.  Ill-tempered, abrupt, pugnacious he is an anti-social individual whose wounds and attitudes seem to have been instilled by previous social encounters.  He is about escape (and not just to South America on the freighter which is coincidently [there's that word again] departing soon, but only after affording him sufficient time to pursue the girl.  His escapes are from the army, from France, from society, ultimaly from himself and, most likely, that past which rendered all escapes necessary in the first place.

He meets his end as a result of his entanglement with the woman (an attempt to re-enter society?) and as a result of a chivalrous act towards her.  No femme fatale, she is innocent in the bringing about of his downfall, but brings it about nonetheless.  Filled with a fog that could be fate, could be the haze of the past, or could be simply photogenic the film is an enjoyable example of French poetic realism, sort of like an American film noir without the suspense and without the scheming woman but with all of the sense of loss, unfulfilled (or only sporadically realized) desires and dark workings of fate characteristic of that genre.  Suspend some of the expectations Hollywood films have created in most of us, spend some time here and you will be rewarded.  You can call it a coincidence.",1185062400,10,3018,4.732824427480916
