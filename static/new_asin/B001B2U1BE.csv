3480152,5,B001B2U1BE,"""Breaking the Maya Code"" is so much better than other videos out there that I have seen and this one  goes so well with the book  ""Breaking the Maya Code"" by Michael Coe. You don't have to read the book but I did ad it explains more information than this film even. Back to this film this video will open your eyes to a new ""old"" world. Most think that the Americas began from Span, but this will get you to wonder if this is true.

The Maya began in the BC and this demonstrates the science that proves it. This is beautifully done and a must have for your video library.",1270166400,4,572,4.089285714285714
3480153,5,B001B2U1BE,"An amazing history of how we have the ancient Mayan glyphs decoded over the last two centuries.  From Russia, to Germany, to the US and Central America, we have the evolution of how the drawings on the Mayan ruins in Southern Mexico and Central America were eventually translated.

We meet the characters who were involved in the hard work of discovery, capturing via hand drawings, rubbings, photos, and then deciphering.  How incredible the work of a handful of linguists and artists and archeologists all dovetailed into bringing to life the words engraved in stone on ancient monuments.

Interestingly, this was all done without a Rosetta Stone.  However, four books from the late 16th century were preserved in libraries throughout Europe.  Hundreds of other books from the time, were destroyed in a massive book burning by the religious powers of the day.  These preserved books became the catalyst of interest of people who started to see things in what they observed.  Observations that were not always correct, lead to more discovery.  In the 1800s more and more of the ruins in the Yucatan/Chiapas, Guatemala and Honduras, were uncovered and the puzzle was put together.

What I got from this is two fold, there were numerous attempts from very bright people to get to the bottom of Mayan writing. The current flow of information regarding 2012, may actually cloud the importance of the information found.  We can now read for certain, the complex histories of a grand culture before its demise.  What we learn may help us to avert disaster in the future.

Additionally, we see the Mayan descendants the many millions who live in relative poverty, being introduced with pride to their history.  Suddenly, a people have a history, that has been shared with them, yet, now, they can learn to read them for themselves in the ancient writings of their ancestors.",1265241600,,1868,4.964630225080386
3480154,4,B001B2U1BE,"As a woman of part-Chippewa (Ojibwa) heritage, I am very interested in both the ancient peoples of the Americas and in the stories of how our cultures have fared since the European settlers ""discovered"" our homelands.

This documentary pulls very few punches when describing the ancient Mayans, the European newcomers, or modern Mayans.

There are stories within stories in this well-crafted documentary: the ancient Mayan story, the modern Mayan story, the European explorer/conqueror story and the personal stories of the various scholars, linguists, enthusiastic amateurs and adventurers who did something amazing, sometimes in spite of themselves: break the ancient Mayan code, a code that was almost neglected -- and actively repressed -- out of existence.

I highly recommend this documentary as a bridge between the past and the future. It pulls together the various strands of its story with nuanced wisdom and humility --  and with almost none of the romanticized sentimentality that so often turns pseudo-scholarly works on Native Americans into something embarrassingly banal.

Very well done.",1264809600,5,1104,5.5476190476190474
3480155,5,B001B2U1BE,"This film shows how the linguists decoded Mayan records; what they guessed with what clues. It does not emphasize how 'mysterious' the Maya civilization was. It does not exaggerate 'mystique' of Maya records. It scholarly explains the history of the decoding, in the way everybody can understand what the linguists did without difficulty. With this documentary, I could experience all intellectual pleasure of the decoding process; besides it showed the beauty of Mayan alphabets themselves. It's amazing!",1259107200,,505,5.571428571428571
3480156,5,B001B2U1BE,"Who said scholarship has to be dry?  While tracing the history of Mayan decipherment, this splendidly photographed film shows what it means to be on location - and what locations they are!  The film is a monument both to the ancient Maya and to those who have dedicated themselves to sharing them with the rest of us.  Beautiful!",1256688000,2,329,4.637931034482759
3480157,5,B001B2U1BE,"Great documentary! You will find the list of people you need to know to study the history of discovering Mayan's culture for the last 200 years. It's a great guide to the world of unique culture. It's also an amazing collection of stories about extraordinary people who gave back living Mayans their language, history and pride.",1241049600,3,328,4.875

3480159,5,B001B2U1BE,"If you saw Cracking the Maya Code on PBS's NOVA series, this is the original for that episode. The NOVA producers had the filmmaker condense this full-length documentary (Breaking the Maya Code) into a one-hour broadcast. Both are stunning, but the full-length documentary gives you even more detail--something you will want. The documentary is assisted by state-of-the-art graphics which allow specific parts of the glyph carvings to light up when they are being discussed, as if the narrator were touching the surface of the carving. By the end of the documentary, when you get to see the deciphered glyphs re-introduced to the Maya themselves, you are almost cheering for a blow against the conquistadores and de Landa--who (almost!) eliminated the culture. The main accomplishment of the film is to lay out the story of how the glyphs were finally unlocked--with many frustrating roadblocks along the way (the key that opened the treasure trove was briefly tried twice before, but stopped each time). The story of the breaking of the glyphs also serves to show how interdisciplinarity is sometimes a necessity, not just a luxury: the ultimate unraveling required contributions from school teachers, amateur archaeologists, artists, art teachers, linguists, photographers, and mathematicians. In addition, one sees how cultural forces shape and distort readings of the glyphs and interpretations of the Maya culture. Simply fascinating!",1226361600,59,1439,5.457399103139013
3480160,5,B001B2U1BE,"If you asked most persons to identify the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century, you would probably hear about space exploration, the cure for polio, or uncovering the structure of DNA.  After watching this film, I would add cracking the Mayan Code belongs in the top 5.  There are literally thousands of Maya ruins with strange pictorial glyphs - but unlike the Egyptian hieroglyphs, scholars had no Rosetta Stone to help translate them.  How then to decipher the ancient language?

This film is not a study of the Maya but a study of the personalities and thinkers who tried to interpret the Mayan picture glyphs. The story embraces a 500 year period.  We begin with Bishop de Landa - a 15th century Spanish priest who asked the Mayan scribes to translate the Mayan sounds into western letters...a librarian in Germany who came across one of the few books still preserved of Mayan writing lost in the stacks...an artist with no special academic training who copied and studied the glyphs in Palenque...a Russian soldier who made the intellectual breakthrough that some of the Mayan writing was not like Chinese  (pictures of ideas) but syllabic symbols...a photographer who photographed Mayan pottery for 30 years...and a 12 year old American genius who started publishing detailed scholarly papers on the language of the ancient Mayas.  The string of personalities is endlessly fascinating. This is a beautifully photographed tribute to a group of unknown thinkers who followed their obsession and step by step deciphered the most difficult code possible.

If you enjoy this film, the director is also responsible for the exciting movie entitled ""Proteus""...another exceptional documentary about scientific discovery. Check it out.",1223942400,23,1751,5.250896057347671
3480161,5,B001B2U1BE,This is an interesting film on how long it took to crack the Maya code. The way various people studied deciphering the glyphs and traveling around in the Guatemala jungles is really fascinating stuff. Good research work and all around great photography and scenes. I recommend this one for the history buffs also of educational benefit to the high school classroom.,1390521600,2,365,5.0
3480162,5,B001B2U1BE,"I'm a documentary junkie.  Nature, history, science; you name it. Many, such as the heavily marketed high-definition Planet Earth series are repeat-watchable based on photography alone.  Few are watchable based purely on content and ""story"".  THIS documentary I've watched multiple times and it remains permanently on my tablet for airline watching.  It engages you in a way that only a great detective story can, and the use of intelligently created graphics --to easily illuminate the Mayan glyphs that are the focus of the film-- guide you very smoothly through it all.  Absolutely fascinating.  I just wish they'd offer a blu-ray hd edition...though this film doesn't require it.  Get it now and dive in!",1368230400,2,708,5.212389380530974
3480163,5,B001B2U1BE,I bought this video because I was producing a planetarium show on all the 2012 bs and wanted a video graphic illustration how the Maya calendar round worked.  (The filmmaker gave me permission).  When my husband and I watched the whole video we were enthralled.  Great video.,1360022400,4,275,4.808510638297872
3480164,5,B001B2U1BE,"I've spent a lot of my free time reading history, mostly European and North American post-colonial stuff. This was such a revelation to me, very much worth the time. I had just finished the book 1491, and was spurred to learn more about this period and this region. I also craved some visual knowledge to pair with that text. This movie was exactly what I needed.

It's part history, part mystery, and part social studies. And the best part came at the end to see the descendants of these ancient people taking this knowledge back, and taking it further--even generating glyph software!

Delightful. Very smart and informative, a well crafted documentary.",1350691200,2,655,4.891891891891892
3480165,4,B001B2U1BE,"This film was very good at revealing the history of how Mayan hieroglyphics were deciphered and the people who were instrumental in helping crack the code. Mayan hieroglyphics appears to be a combination of logographics and syllables, it's really quite complicated and interesting. The archaeologists and linguists who figured out how the hieroglyphics work are very dedicated.

One of the things I liked best about the documentary was learning the decipherment of the Mayan writing system wasn't the work of one person, but the result of many people building on each other's works and collaborations.

It's a shame that Diego de Landa, the Spanish bishop, burned most of the Mayan books and imposed Spanish culture upon the Mayans. Only four Mayan books (codices) have survived. I am glad ancient Mayan history,and culture is once again being uncovered.

Well-presented documentary, it kept me tuned in throughout the film.",1349827200,2,924,5.272108843537415
3480166,5,B001B2U1BE,"I know what you're thinking - how interesting can this possibly be?  Dusty old remnants of heiroglyphic carvings statically filmed for another of those PBS-tyle documentaries for crusty old pedants smoking pipes.

But this really is fascinating.  It's interesting how this written language could have been studied for so long over the centuries and still been misunderstood so many times.  The language is logical, yet quirky, with colloquial styles and subtly different forms.  It mixes purely graphical elements (like Chinese) with ""sound adapters"" like a more alphabetic language.

But again, it's the history of the discoveries and the wrong turns and breakthroughs by various people that make this so interesting.  And reintroducing (!) the language to modern day Mayan descendents is a beautiful way to end the story.  An entire race that did not have access to its own history for so long....",1326240000,,899,5.2377622377622375
3480167,5,B001B2U1BE,"This DVD has not, as far as I am aware, been shown on television. It is far superior to the vast majority of documentaries on the subject that do appear on TV, especially now that we are being bombarded by the totally unfounded Dec. 2012 Mayan end-of-the world predictions (legitimate Maya scholars all dismiss the prediction as nonsense -- the text upon which the so-called prediction is supposedly based is vague and does not warn of disaster, just social change).

The facts in this documentary are backed by the most respected experts in the field. So many others that purport to be of this excellent quality come nowhere near it. This is based on Michael Coe's classic, respected text on the subject, so you can't ask for much more. It has been updated with the author's oversight, so the info is fresh. It is also easily understandable for those of us who are not experts but still find the Maya and the Mayan glyphs fascinating.

A first rate piece that is well over an hour long.",1311120000,3,987,4.6022727272727275
3480168,5,B001B2U1BE,"Well documented and rich in details, I recomend this video for those wanting to undestand better the mayan culture. In comparision with some other videos, this is definitely the one to chose. It presents almost the same information as ""Cracking the Maya Code - NOVA"", only with a few more minutes, and a much more comprehensive study than ""Mystery of the Maya"", by detailing how the symbols were created and what they mean, both in written and sponken ways, without mentioning it covers the basic information, such as which were the grather cities, religion, maths and te decline of the mayan civilization.",1286928000,,606,4.950980392156863
3480169,5,B001B2U1BE,"This video is the story of a civilization whose enigmatic glyphs puzzled the world for centuries and the long, often frustrating efforts by priests, renaissance men, scholars and gifted amateurs to decifer the words left by them in stone.

The video does an excellent job of chronicling the people who added to our knowledge of the Maya in fits and starts over the centuries. It shows the breaking of the Maya written language, in fits and starts, beginning with the deciferment of their system of mathematics. The video shows the many arguments whether the glyphs were phonetic, syllabic or represented entire ideas or concepts.

I was surprised by the number of breakthroughs that were made not by scholars but by gifted amateurs who were able to bring a fresh perspective to the process. It was a story of individual insights and creative collaboration assisted by the Xerox machine!

Visually, the video was very well done and showed the remains of what was a sophisticated civilization. The dvd does an excellent job of visually introducing the viewer to the glyphs, showing how they are used to make sentences as well as the artistic lattitude the ancient scribes had to express thoughts. I was struck by the amazing artistic talent of those ancient Maya scribes as they recorded royal geneologies, history, diplomacy and a multitude of other things people record for posterity.

The dvd contains interviews with those who played major roles in the breaking of the code (in the case of those who are deceased, their thoughts are transmitted to us through their writings) and adds greatly to the viewer's understanding of the circumstances of their contributions as well as their work from their own words.

This is an excellent documentary that was well made, informative, entertaining and was able to convey the passion of researchers to solve the puzzle of the Maya glyphs that the story of the Maya could be known to us. I reccomend this with five stars!",1276214400,2,1963,4.9363636363636365
3480170,5,B001B2U1BE,"If you've ever wondered how the scientific community really attacks a problem, watch this video.  There are occasional brilliant insights, but this shows the painstaking, behind the scenes work done by an array of professional (and amateur) researchers that lead up to that one big leap.  Einstein didn't work in a vacuum, many researchers spent decades amassing the work that Einstein would ultimately tie together to develop relativity.  So it is in some ways with the breaking of the Maya code.  The Mayans left an incredibly detailed account of their history and culture right in front of us, and for centuries we hadn't a clue as to what it meant.  A mystery that started with the Spanish conquest of central America several centuries ago, and only resolved (well, mostly resolved) in the past few decades.  In this DVD, you'll watch how generations of researchers slowly put together bits and pieces of the puzzle.  You'll listen to accounts of young researchers as they recall the high points of key conferences and key moments, as well as the arduous months in the jungles carefully photographing and drawing the Mayan symbols on temples, stelae, and other antiquities.  The symbols are also reproduced graphically so that the viewer can see how the written Mayan language all fits together.  You probably won't be reading the symbols on the temple walls by the end of the DVD, but you'll be able to recognize the symbols and how they all fit together! There are so many fascinating details presented in this outstanding documentary.  One of the most famous, most knowledgeable Mayan scholars was completely wrong on one key aspect of the translation, and probably held up progress for decades, but quickly and graciously relented when shown convincingly that he was wrong.  One thing that puzzled linguists for years about the Mayan language was that they were unsure whether is was an alphabetic language (like English) or a purely symbolic language (like Chinese).  The alphabetic languages have several dozen characters, and symbolic languages have hundreds or thousands.  The Mayan language had about 80 or so.  The great breakthrough came when it was realized that some of the characters had the same meaning and that there were only 30 or 40 distinct characters - the language was alphabetic.  Bottom line - great documentary - a no-brainer if you're even remotely into this sort of this.",1273363200,10,2403,5.032828282828283

8281570,4,B001B2U1BE,"Mysteries can be a lot of fun, but when you have a real life, archeological mystery such as this, it's a real blast.

Here's the scoop. This documentary takes the viewer through the discovery of the Mayan ruins up to the deciphering of their writing.

This is just cool. You get to find out about, and even meet, many of the people who discovered the ruins and helped break the seemingly undecipherable glyphs that adorned said ruins. You get to see the fits and starts of the earlier code breakers and then meet the later ones who made tremendous strides in building the coherent methodology that made the glyphs some 90% readable. Part of what makes this viewing great is seeing these people (including one boy at the age of 12) gain such an interest and passion that moved them to spend immeasurable amounts of time to work this puzzle. Some smarts, some intuition, but always a lot of hard work helped build the story brick by brick.

There are the usual talking heads explaining the story and process. Thankfully they are those who were actually involved in the process. There is a lot of good footage of the various sites themselves as well as the glyphs themselves. The two are intertwined in good measure to keep the viewer involved.

My only complaint is some of the things they left out. To my eyes these glyphs are very abstract. So how did they figure this glyph represents this and that glyph represents that? I don't need to know how they figured all of them out but just a couple would have helped me greatly. Other than that, this is a very worthwhile documentary.",1435363200,,1580,4.572438162544169
