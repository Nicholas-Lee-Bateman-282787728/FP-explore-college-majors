8656974,5,B00KALQI2S,"Along with ""The Lost Weekend"" from 1946, this is one of my two favorite addiction movies. With today's young crop of wooden mannequins using looks to get roles instead of talent, Hoffman was just the opposite. Just watching the change in mood and nuanced emotion in his face done with such effortless brilliance reaffirms he, along with Daniel Day Lewis, were the 2 best under 60 actors in movies until his tragic death.",1449792000,,420,4.767123287671233
