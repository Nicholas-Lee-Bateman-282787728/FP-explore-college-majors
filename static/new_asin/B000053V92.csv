7930632,4,B000053V92,This series was great and they need to bring it out on DVD!  VHS does not do it justice and the old tapes are too expensive!,1390867200,,124,3.769230769230769
7930633,4,B000053V92,"After being mildly diverted by the first of the trilogy (not seen the second), this was more up my street. To mirror her harder, even tougher stance Bobbie's leather-like outfit is all in black instead of sepia as formerly, and the action is racked up a notch.  Discovering that she has a similarly engineered brother (who goes rogue) adds an intriguing dimension.  Great fight scenes and our heroine lead makes it convincing that she can take on the toughest guys.  The ambiguous ending seemed to suggest that the cat-and-mouse duel would be revived in part 4, which unfortunately did not come to fruition.  Perhaps we can have a  futuristic running ding-dong between enhanced good/bad sisters sometime?  The action, even for sci-fi, is more effective when bullets splatter rather than have (no doubt equally lethal) lasers fizz.  ""Interrogating"" a hammy wheel-chaired villain is simple.  Just unplug his life support systems (the Hal computer had a similar Achilles heel in Kubrick's awesome ""2001"" made way back in 1968, a still thought-provoking sci-fi fable, but it's hardly fair to relate this hardly brain-bending exercise to that classic).",1363219200,,1147,5.195652173913044
7930634,4,B000053V92,"I really enjoyed all three Chameleon movies when I saw them on TV.  As others have already said, Bobbie Phillips is not only hot, but she's a good actress as well, and it's a shame her career isn't bigger than it is.  I would buy all three of these movies if they ever come out on DVD.",1202083200,7,285,3.982456140350877
7930635,5,B000053V92,"Bobbie Phillips is gorgeous in this movie, that pretty much goes without saying. I like it better than the original Chameleon film because she had obviously been working hard on her movie-style martial arts stuntwork skills in the years between them. If you take this picture along with her work in Crow: Stairway to Heaven and Ring of Fire 3 (with Don Wilson), you have a beautiful, talented, and underrated actress who has learned enough to do almost all of her own stunts and do them very well. That's relatively rare. For this I am willing to forgive the less-believeable use of her ""chameleon"" powers here, the cheezy evil brother in service to a madman trying to subjugate the world plot, and the strange claim of getting a chameleon-like attribute from ""cougar genes"". (lol) Ms. Phillips has never looked, acted or stunt-played any better than in this movie, imho. Some of the fight scenes rise to the level of the best from Hong Kong over the years.",1187568000,2,957,4.736526946107785
7930636,5,B000053V92,"dear readers, i  i looked all  over for a print of this  movie and  finnally got one at amazon.com. i first saw this movie on a friday  night 7 til 9pm  special on the old upn  network. the  cgi is okay as long as you don't expect matrix like effects. KAMM reminds me of a much prettier female version of  Deathlok the demolisher strong  deadly yet  no one wants her around anylonger than is absolutely  nessesary. Bobbie Phillips could wear a burlap sack shift and would still look  gorgeous. the fight scenes are well  choreographed. and  the bit  with the  talk with the mongoose was hiliarious. her  ""brother"" Kaine was almost a sympathetic  character.given it is made in 1999 i give it five stars.  thank you for your time",1178323200,2,727,4.488372093023256
7930637,4,B000053V92,"I've seen all three films and I liked 1 and 3 the best.  In this newest film there was more action, the overall look of the film is a bit darker and tougher. Kam's ( Bobbie's) transformation over the three films is right on target.  In three, she still defies authority but has gained strength and character.  Basically, she's come into her own.  You won't find better acting and action in a made for tv/video movie!",1016755200,6,416,4.434210526315789
7930638,4,B000053V92,"i'm thinking she must of had a child recently.because she looks drasticaly different from the first movie.other then that a tight movie.

no no seriously lol,this movie is ok,but this franchise seems like it wants to be ghost in the shell SOOOOOOOOOO badly.eitherway bobbi phillips is hotter than ever.and i'm shocked she never blew up,and became famous.hell she's angelina jolie before angelina jolie was angelina jolie",1016064000,3,420,5.363636363636363
7930639,5,B000053V92,"This movie is MUCH better than I thought it would be-and it's all because the actress BOBBIE PHILLIPS is AMAZING! It's all been done before but,somehow this terrific actress brought something new to it! This is a must see for any action fan. If you want to see a woman who is believable kicking men's a**es,you can't miss it!",998524800,6,325,4.52542372881356
7930640,4,B000053V92,"Bobbie Phillips can carry action movies with amazing believability and skill!  What's amazing is this ""Dark Angel"" was done BEFORE the one on FOX.  I would've rather seen this one as a regular series.  A MUST SEE for any action lover!",994291200,4,234,4.658536585365853
7930641,2,B000053V92,"This is pretty stylish, undemanding fun and Bobbi Phillips is fantastic in her role as Cham.  If the producers have the money she should make a theatrical movie of Chameleon.  Because what this, and the other films, seriously need is a bigger budget and more time.  Bobbi Phillips is perfect for her role and she can pack an emotional punch.  But the rest of the characters are cliched and I didn't really care for them - the script and the cast need more time.  More money would also mean less fights and some more spectacular set pieces .  I got bored with one skirmish following the other, especially when they rely to much on fast editing.  You don't get enough time to appreciate just how good the film looks because the camera doesn't keep still.  I liked the music and some of the costumes, but the cheesey CGI city was well tacky and the bad guys' motorbike looked awful.  Fortunately, everything about Cham is great and she carries the film.  Put your brain on hold and it's fun, but don't expect to be moved.  And the makers could blow us away in everyway, if they turned it into a movie.",982800000,6,1098,4.44
