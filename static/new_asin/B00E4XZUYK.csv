5890695,5,B00E4XZUYK,I purchased this video for my daughter who has now made the decision to become a vet. Thanks to Dr. Pol he has helped encourage her to followher dreams.,1387756800,,152,4.275862068965517
5890696,5,B00E4XZUYK,"How could you not love Dr. Pol?  He's an energetic 70-year-old vet who still wrestles cows.  He can diagnose at a glance, but he is also compassionate and warm.",1384819200,,160,4.482758620689655
5890697,5,B00E4XZUYK,"My granddaughter wants to be a vet and she recorded this every week on TV, talked me into watching it and we are addicted.  Dr. Pol is a vet in the middle of Michigan who helps everyone.  Dr. Pol is the country doctor you would love to have for your animals.  It is interesting, insightful and there is a touch of humor as well.  The whole family would enjoy it.",1377475200,,362,4.128571428571429
5890698,3,B00E4XZUYK,Never seen it bought as a gift,1484265600,,30,3.4285714285714284
5890699,5,B00E4XZUYK,"Right up there with James Herriot.  Love watching the Pols.  Only problem is that is does not have a menu to let you start the show on 1, 2, 3 etc.  You have to fast forward all the way until you get to the place you left off.  It doesn't even stop when you get to the end of one session.  Shame on National Geographic.  They should have done a better job.",1480291200,4,356,3.875

5890704,5,B00E4XZUYK,"I have loved this show since I discovered it a year ago.  Dr. Pol is full of humor, sensitivity, respect (for animals and their humans) and knowledge.  A lot of the procedures he practices have been learned the hard way.  Diane and Charles add a lot to the show, as does the other vets and the office personnel.  They make up an amazing 'herd' of people who keep me riveted to the TV on Saturday nights!",1437523200,3,403,4.2631578947368425
5890705,5,B00E4XZUYK,This DVD really covers the activities of Dr. Pol.  I would highly recommend it.,1436140800,,79,4.642857142857143

5890709,4,B00E4XZUYK,We love Dr. Pol's shows and I got this for a bedridden family member to watch on a DVD player in her bed. She was a huge animal lover and enjoyed this often before she passed.,1420761600,2,175,3.888888888888889
5890710,4,B00E4XZUYK,"This was a great dvd, though it did have several repeats from Season 1. Still, there were a couple in here that were new! Dr Pol is a no-nonsense type of vet with a great sense of humor.

The dvd arrived quickly and on time.",1420588800,3,224,3.977777777777778

5890712,5,B00E4XZUYK,Great product!,1419897600,,14,6.5
5890713,2,B00E4XZUYK,"I knew buying these disc it was made to order, meaning it wouldn't have any menus on it, what I didn't expect was skipping in the first episode and the color muting itself to the point where someone might thing there tv is on it's last leg.  What even worse is that if you buy these from the parent company you'd have spent about $30 more...they should be ashamed for putting out such a great show on such a bad product.

This was a Christmas gift to my parents who have never seen the show, and I'm embarrassed to have bought it for them.",1419724800,3,539,4.173076923076923

5890717,5,B00E4XZUYK,Fantastic loved every minute of it. Highly recommended,1410825600,,54,5.875
5890718,2,B00E4XZUYK,"Bought this for my 4-year-old granddaughter.  She loves Dr. Pol.  Great concept, but the sound did not sync with the lip movements.  Very distracting and irritating.  This could have been a really good viewing experience if it weren't for that.",1410048000,3,244,5.025
5890719,5,B00E4XZUYK,I love Dr. Pol. With that said the only thing about this set is the lack of DVD menu when you first put the movie in. I can't wait for the next season.,1404518400,,151,3.606060606060606
5890720,5,B00E4XZUYK,"We can watch Dr Pol and his staff all day long!.. Everyone in my house loves his compassion, humor and genuine love for the animals... My family has been in the horse business for decades and i can tell you we would trust Dr Pol with them and our family pets in a heart beat. Great show!!",1398470400,,288,4.0701754385964914
5890721,4,B00E4XZUYK,I wish this 4 disc series would work properly. The 3rd disc plays the first episode and keeps repeating itself. 'A' sent me a replacement but it has the same defect. Regretfully I have asked for a refund.,1398124800,2,204,4.394736842105263
5890722,4,B00E4XZUYK,"The way they formatted the DVD could have been done better. I use my computer to play DVDs and it would only play the first episode on the disk until I realized that I had to select a different ""Title"" under VLC player because there was no menu built into the disc like with movies or anything else I have watched on a DVD. In fact my laptop did not even see that there was a disc in it! Thankfully my desktop DVD player could see it.

Other than that, me and my friends love watching Dr. Pol, and it was cheaper to buy the DVD set than to buy them Digitally which is normally the opposite. The quality is standard and not HD, which I expected.",1397952000,5,644,4.070866141732283
5890723,5,B00E4XZUYK,"Fantastic show. His passion for animals and common sense approach is amazing.
Incredible series, you can watch over and over.",1395446400,,125,5.3
5890724,5,B00E4XZUYK,"I love Dr Pol series! ....It is true and original; only thing I don't care for is the image seems a little bit blurry, not sure why that is, but I am still glad I made this purchase, now I have this show forever!",1395273600,3,212,3.840909090909091
5890725,5,B00E4XZUYK,Great DVD's for my daughter who is going to college to become a Vet.  She loves them!  Dr. Pol and staff are super and the show is entertaining as well as educational.,1394496000,,167,4.1875
5890726,2,B00E4XZUYK,The DVD can only play from the beginning each time so if you want to see later episodes you have to fast forward through to a particular episode.  Very annoying.,1392422400,,161,4.366666666666666
5890727,3,B00E4XZUYK,"I love Dr Pol and I do think this is a great video.  I have tinnitus and can not understand accents very well.  I put the dvd in and it started to play instantly.  You can pause it but can not go backwards.  There is no set up in the beginning to jump to different episodes or add closed captions.  Heaven forbid you hit the stop button by mistake, you'll have to start the entire dvd from the beginning.",1392163200,6,404,4.063291139240507

8601271,1,B00E4XZUYK,"Someone gave my wife Season 2 as a Christmas. Dr. Pol DVD's were all she wanted for Christmas. She wanted to watch all of these so she popped in Disc 1. It stopped multiple times, locking up the player. It finally stopped working altogether. So Disc 1 is no good. What can I do for recourse? Also, it's a very poorly designed DVD. There's no top menu so you can't see what's on it and select. The Discs can only be played one after another. For these prices they should have done a much better job. This stinks! :(",1515628800,,514,4.202020202020202
8601272,1,B00E4XZUYK,"bought as a Christmas gift,, not all of the discs will play,, have tried them in multiple payers and some of the disc just say error so they can not watch them.  lot of money to spend on an item that doen't work.",1515283200,2,212,3.9302325581395348
