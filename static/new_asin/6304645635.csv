921173,4,6304645635,"This is a good adaptation of a great novel. The ""Tenant"", Helen Graham, is a mysterious and solitary woman.  She comes to Wildfell Hall to escape from an abusive alcoholic husband.  She only wants to be left alone with her son to provide a safe and quite environment for the boy: away from the influence of his father.  Helen's simple desires are not easily realized in the small town full of busybodies.  She meets Gilbert and reluctantly falls in love with him.  Circumstances require her to return to her husband, but love must win out in the end.
This is a dark, mysterious story and the filming does a very good job getting that across.  If you like period films, this is a good one.",977875200,12,688,4.464
921174,5,6304645635,"This video (which runs for 160 mins) follows rather closely to the classic novel by Anne Bronte (except for the ending - nevertheless, it will still please you).
The production is lavish, the costumes beautiful and very  correct to the period of time. The cast very capably brought to life the  characters of the suffering Helen Graham, the scoundrel Arthur Huntington  and the love-struck Gilbert Markham.
Tara Fitzgerald appeared a little  miscast, owing to her often unnecessarly harsh displays of emotions and an  unsuitable gruffy voice. But because she played the role of Helen Graham  (who's an exceedingly likable heroine), I grew to ignore all that and found  myself rooting for Helen to find all the happiness she deserves.
I simply  love Toby Stephens whom I think, is just perfect as Gilbert, the handsome,  young gentleman farmer who sees the goodness in Helen and seeks to protect  her from the hypocrisy and prejudice shown by his unkind relatives and  neighbours.
The cinematography is lush and breathtaking. It's obvious  that this is a well-planned production with no expense spared.
I have  only 1 minor complaint - that the romantic scenes involving Helen and  Gilbert weren't made more passionate (the way it should be). Instead, we  see more displays of love and affection between Helen and Lord Huntington  (during their courtship days and early marriage). And to what purpose do  they serve? - Since we know just what a brute Huntington turns out to be  later!
If you love this video, please pick up the book (ie. if you  haven't already) - the book fleshes out the thoughts, emotions and agonies  of the love-lorn Gilbert much more effectively than could be captured on  film.
Nevertheless, I love this video. It's great to have in one's  collection for repeated viewings.",956361600,182,1797,4.97979797979798

However, beginning at the end of the first episode, a real story started emerging, and I got through the next two episodes to find out what would happen.  Satisfying ending.

I had a hard time with the darkness of this movie - and I am specifically talking about the lighting. It was just dreary. Oh, and no one seemed to think twice about how violent Gilbert is - and jealous.  From the frying pan....?",1493337600,,565,4.2924528301886795
921432,4,6304645635,"Having read the book, I wanted to see the tv series.  It was quite good until the end when the writers or director decided to change some things and made a confusing mess out of it.  I can recommend the book, especially if you want clarity!",1492819200,3,240,4.195652173913044
921433,1,6304645635,"This was a muddled atmospherically dreary presentation that fails to warm you to any of the characters. Tara Fitzgerald is positively frigid in most every scene. Her sallowness & stern scowl make you want to look  She does  convey her character's fear well, but she looks dreadful & between her manner & her wardrobe, she's more witchy than bewitching. Why are men flocking to her ?The story itself is dismal & unpleasant. Toby Stephens's character also is problematical. The first scene of him has him flirting with & kissing a woman. Yet he soon switches his attention to Tara Fitzgerald with what appears to be a creepy feaverish obsession. His interactions with her, her son & her brother show him to be more controlling & violent than is romantic.(IE : upon 1st meeting Fitzgerald & her son he proceeds to tell her how to raise him. He speaks condescendingly to her, he presumes her affections, he beats up a man he believes to be a competeting suitor.). Really he seems to have all the ingredients to make turn out very much like her abusive husband.
This is a depressing drama. I found myself wanting to fast forward through it.
Note: Some scenes are quick nightmareish flashbacks one uncessarily overly long scene of a husband caressing his scatily clad wife , another of him choking her, & what seem to be 2 attempts at amoris endeavours that come across as violent, almost attempted rape.
Never read the book, but sounds like the other reviewers recommend it over the movie & in my opinion it would take much to be better than the movie",1491955200,,1546,4.680147058823529

921517,3,6304645635,"Changes made for the movie version were poorly done and made the story confusing; the book is much better.  I had read the book, but my mother had not, and the scenes that were flashbacks were so badly worked in that it muddled the story rather than enlightening her as to the backstory.  This is what I call ""transitional"" BBC, the time period when they were doing better than the ""I, Claudius"" era, as far as production quality, but not yet at the level they have now reached.  Oddly, this movie is dated a year earlier than the Best EVER version of Pride & Prejudice [Colin Firth], but the visual quality is not as good as P&P; the casting is nowhere near as good as P&P either. I did not care for the alterations of the story that were made for the movie version, and the two romantic lead characters had zero chemistry, both together and individually.  The lead actress was not attractive, nor was the male lead very much better; the performances were stilted for the most part, I felt.  Perhaps BBC will do an updated version of this story in future, giving it a worthy adaptation to screen.",1484870400,5,1097,4.465

921623,5,6304645635,"This is pre-HD but it is visually gorgeous. Performances -- especially Tara Fitzgerald -- are first rate.

It's an extremely rich and dark story -- a gothic anti-romance/romance told from the women's perspective. Totally revolutionary for its time. there are enough layers, and the story takes place over a long enough period of time, that handling it in a mini-series really gives it the depth and detail it needs. And I did I remember to point out that Tara Fitzgerald is wonderful as the woman who has been abused by a drunk husband but still has the strength to get away and protect her son, only to find suspicion and hostility from people who don't know who she is.",1476489600,4,671,4.638655462184874

921696,1,6304645635,"Very disappointed in this adaptation of Anne Bronte's novel.  I was so excited that there was a dvd available after listening to the unabridged version that I didn't take the time to read any reviews before purchasing this dvd.  Mistake!  I didn't even finish watching it.  The actress, Tara Fitzgerald, who played the central character, Helen Graham Huntingdon, came across as very flat & harsh.  She did not capture the multifaceted protagonist, Helen, whose inner strength and unwavering convictions came from her personal faith in God which is so central to her character.  The only reference made to her personal faith is a cross necklace that she wears.  But in defense of the actors in this dvd, they only had 159 minutes to act out a story that takes a very long time to build & unfold.  There was no time for character development, and there were several ""creative licenses"" taken that were not in the novel, especially the bedroom scenes between Helen & her husband, Arthur Huntingdon.
In closing, this is a poor representation of The Tenant of Windfall Hall.  I recommend that you take the time to read the novel or listen to it on cd.",1475107200,,1146,4.747474747474747

922386,1,6304645635,"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte

It all depends if you have or have not read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.

If you have not read it, you may find the movie to your liking for whatever reasons.  Some viewer comments on the movie would verify that.  However, watching this movie will give you very little idea of the actual story and the brilliant writing of the youngest and unheralded Bronte sister Anne.

We all see what we see.  So, if you have read the novel and are thinking about purchasing the movie, just be aware of what you will encounter:

This film interpretation was tortured and excruciating.  Movie adaptations are often disappointing because time does not allow for development on the one hand, and on the other hand producers seem to think they can improve on the work of classic creative geniuses.  Check, and double check on this Rupert Graves, Tara Fitzgerald, Toby Stephens adaptation.  I struggled from the beginning to keep from ejecting the DVD and trashing my purchased copy.  Having endured it to the end, it will now go to my local library book sale.

The movies characterizations generally missed the mark, save for Rupert Graves superb portrayal of Arthur Huntingdon.  He is the charming sociopathic life of the party, who morphed into the consummately evil spousal abuser after he had enticed Helen into marriage.  But Helen was not without sin, for she believed that her love would change the profligate into a God fearing and faithful husband.  In modern terms, he sweet talked her, made her laugh, and he had potential to be reformed and moral as she would have liked him to be.  Surprise!  She ignored her aunts warnings, and even her own intuition, and paid for it dearly.  He was a miserably abusive, drunken, unfaithful, child abusing husband, often on lengthy flings to that partying town of London.  He had the money to do it, and as it was in those days, he also had control of her money.  Give Rupert Graves ten stars for his role; I still shiver thinking about his despicable self.

Helen Huntingdon, known in hiding as Mrs. Graham, secretly fled to Wildfell Hall with her son, to escape her drunken and violent husband.  Tara Fitzgerald, destroyed Brontes version of Helen by playing her as a nasty, irritating, anti-social newcomer to the secret area.  To be sure, she avoided discovery by being careful of gaining notoriety, and was therefore socially quiet, but not the grating personality Fitzgerald made her out to be.  That portrayal ruined the movie from the beginning.

Gilbert Markham was an attractive young farmer in the area where Wildfell Hall was located, and he right away took to Mrs. Graham and her son, not knowing she was a married woman.  Being that this was an early nineteenth century novel, naturally theres going to be all kinds of hidden stuff going on that create the tensions and thwart the hots that people get for each other.  That smoldering never heated up between the actors, even though many reviewers had a lot of hotness going on for Toby Stephens.

OK.  Thats the first third of the movie and its pretty accurate with respect to the novel.  From there on, the movie has little or nothing to do with the novel.  If you truly enjoyed Anne Brontes writing, eschew the movie and retain that warm fuzzy feeling that a good classic novel gives you.

In some of the earlier reviewer comments you can find some of the fantasies the screen writer invented, including rape, a little boy falling off a cliff, etc., etc., etc.  Im avoiding spoilers here, but do not pay attention to any ideas that the movie is faithful to the novel.

Toby Stephens.

Toby Stephens.

Maggie Smith's (Downton Abbey, for you neophytes) son is not an ugly man, and that is reason enough to watch The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.

On top of that, this might be the most interesting of all the Bronte sisters' works, and that's a much better reason than the handsome Toby Stephens.

The story is an age old one - girl meets boy; boy's an abusive hedonist with nihilistic tendencies; girl escapes marriage with kid in tow; girl returns to marriage after living under an assumed name in a small gossipy village - well, clearly you can see how things will of course end happily. Now's the time for me to reiterate: TOBY STEPHENS.

What is great about the story is Helen. As she negotiates her troubled marriage, as she negotiates her relationships with her fellow villagers, as she negotiates her friendship with Gilbert (TOBY STEPHENS!), Helen listens to her inner voice, her own sense of moral right, remaining independent in spite of the machinations and influence of those surrounding her.  She is an altogether fascinating protagonist, and this adaptation serves the novel well.",1416700800,5,1135,4.942105263157894

922583,2,6304645635,"Perhaps because I recently finished listening to the book on audio, (narrated by Jenny Agutter and Alex Jennings), it's very clear in my mind. As a result, the editing changes made in this adaptation left me feeling a bit disappointed. It's a long book, 432 pages (or in the case of audio, 16+ hours), so much of the story had to be cut or condensed so that it could be made into three 1 hour episodes. But the length of the series wasn't the problem.

Helen Huntington, the main character, is a quiet, pious woman who left her husband to protect her child from his debauchery. She is not written as unpleasant or angry, as portrayed by Tara Fitzgerald in the film. It was such a departure from the character that it was difficult to watch. There are other things as well, such as the scenes where she was beaten and raped by her husband. These things did not happen in the book, nor would it have made sense for Helen to return to Huntington to nurse him if he had done such terrible things. Why the director/screen writer felt the need to sensationalize the story out of all resemblance to the original is a mystery. It really altered the characters motivations.

The book is so well done that I think I'll just stick with it. If your interesting the audio version, the one with Jenny Agutter reading is a great version.",1415145600,2,1322,4.458677685950414

922586,5,6304645635,"This drama I highly recommend - powerful acting, beautiful settings and a clear story line that those who have not read the novel can readily follow.  Mood music is utilized sparingly and to good effect, enhancing particular scenes with subtlety.  This is not a period piece that depicts the usual ""proper"" behavior, but rather demonstrates realistically that all was not perfect.  Even though appearances were considered of utmost importance, debauchery occurred behind closed doors, inflicting pain and misery as always.

As strong as is Helen's moral character, so is her husband's immoral character.  Arthur is played to such perfection as to be totally reprehensible.  Even when Anna's love remains steadfast and she displays compassion, shedding tears as she attributes his behavior to self-loathing, I was still unable to feel anything except disgust toward him.  (This is a testament to the acting skills of Rupert Graves.)

Like Helen tells Gilbert, after Arthur has passed and he proposes to her:  ""A second marriage is a triumph of hope over experience.""  The intensity of this gripping drama was relieved by the joyful ending, as Anna through all her suffering still maintained her core strength of character and ability to love.",1410652800,4,1241,5.253807106598985

922673,5,6304645635,"In the 1800s, an abused woman didn't have a lot of options. She couldn't get a divorce, all her property and her children belonged to her husband, and society turned a blind eye unless she actually got murdered.

And this haunting idea is at the heart of ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" a miniseries that brings to life Anne Bronte's classic novel. Pastoral beauty and simple village life are stained by the flashbacks to grotesque physical and mental abuse, and the story rests on an excellent trio of performances by Toby Stephens, Tara Fitzgerald and Rupert Graves.

A mysterious woman and her young son move into the remote Wildfell Hall, without telling anyone of their arrival. Though the villagers are initially curious and welcoming, they eventually become hostile to Mrs. Helen Graham (Fitzgerald) because she doesn't act like a proper Victorian lady -- she's prickly, blunt, reclusive and opinionated, and seems incredibly protective of her young son Arthur. Furthermore, they suspect that she's having an affair with her landlord Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy).

Yeoman farmer Gilbert Markham (Stephens) is immediately attracted to Helen, and manages to get under her armor enough to strike up an odd little friendship with her. But his ex-girlfriend Eliza spreads noxious rumors about Helen and Mr. Lawrence, and Gilbert becomes jealous.

After he knocks Lawrence off his horse, an angered Helen gives him her diaries -- which reveal the horrifying, abusive marriage that she escaped from. As a naive young girl, she married the dashing rake Arthur Huntingdon (Graves), but soon learned that he was an abusive drunk who wanted her just for sex, and eventually loathed her for disapproving of his ways. Though Helen has escaped him, he's determined to get her and his son back...

Anne Bronte's ""A Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" was an incredibly controversial novel in its time, and the miniseries more than does it justice. In fact, at times it ramps up the horror of Helen's grotesque marriage, such as when Arthur nearly rapes her while she is pregnant, or when she is forced to listen to her husband having sex with his longtime mistress.

It's a stark contrast to the pastoral, weathered prettiness of the village; while Grassdale Manor is full of flickering firelight, rich colours and luxurious cloth, the countryside is full of mossy stones, grey skies and rolling grassy hills. Despite all the gossip, the countryside is a cleansing, purifying force.

The entire first episode is devoted to stoking the mystery of who Helen is and why she's here, without giving any answers -- although there are plenty of hints (the spinning bird, her reaction to a Punch and Judy show). Once she gives her diaries to Gilbert, the backstory unfolds like a poisonous flower blooming, even as Gilbert goes to Grassdale to make a last impassioned plea to Helen.

The cast in this miniseries is simply superb -- Stephens as a clear-eyed young farmer whose honesty and kindness attract Helen despite her bad experiences, and Fitzgerald as a fierce young woman who is determined to protect her son. They have a subtle, powerful chemistry in every scene they're in together, and you end up wanting nothing more than for them to end up together.

On the other hand, Graves plays a monstrously sadistic man who draws in a young girl with his charm, then sprays her with hatred when she doesn't magically change to become just as depraved as he. Perhaps he's most hatable in two scenes -- when he teaches his young son to kill innocent animals, and when he grins sadistically at Gilbert after Gilbert fails to convince Helen to leave with him.

""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" is a magnificent literary adaptation -- the acting is magnificent, the direction excellent, and the story a powerful one that still resonates today.",1401926400,,3809,4.965463108320251

The movie didn't stick to those inhibitions which gave Bronte's characters purity, and spiritual redemption but overall it's worth watching and owning.  I love Toby Stephens too.",1394496000,,390,4.705882352941177
922736,2,6304645635,"I admit that this novel is more difficult to be turned into a film than e.g. ""Jane Eyre"", which was written by Anne Bronts sister Charlotte and already turned into films as well as theatre plays more than once. Usually one feels with Jane from the beginning on, since she is portrayed as a victim, while Helen's situation is mysterious at the beginning and clarified only after a while.

In particular I believe that right before the opening titles of the film a few explanations concerning the laws and customs of the time it is set in would have been necessary (early 19th century) with regard to the situation and role of women in the English society of the time: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" was received with an enormous scandal by the readers when it was first published since it is the story of a woman who leaves her husband. The marital vow ""for better for worse"" applied without exception then, even if, as in this case, the husband develops a drinking habit, beats his wife, humiliates her in public and wants to teach his son drinking and mindlessly killing animals, too. Usually, at the time a woman did not have the right on own property either and thus was at the mercy of some man - father, uncle, guardian, husband - all of her life. That Helen actually works to earn her living was for this reason also seen as scandalous. The situation of e.g. Jane Eyre is easier understandable for today's reader respectively viewer, since she is an orphan and remains unmarried until the novel's last chapter, which may explain perhaps why her story is by far more popular and universally understandable than the one about Helen Huntingdon, although it does not rank behind it in depth, tragedy and criticism against the society of the time: in both cases we are dealing with a woman struggling for her own independence and personal dignity against all the circumstances against her.

I believe that the novel could have been made into a good and interesting film: but instead of emphasizing the social factors of the time in order to make Helens' situation more understandable, the authors rely on clichs and cheap, trashy effects. Arthur's orgies are shown, once we have to witness how Arthur almost rapes Helen, the birth of their son is to be seen almost graphically; the child's fall into a crevice and subsequent rescue during a trip to the sea were never part of the novel, and Helen was not present when Gilbert beat her brother out of jealousy. At the end of the film we have not Gilbert who wrongly believes that Helen is getting married again, it is she who believes he is the groom; but the groom is her own brother, how high is the probability that she did not know he was to be married on this day?
Helen was described as a very gifted painter in the novel, while we hardly see her works in the film; also she was depicted as extraordinarily beautiful, which one can unfortunately not say of Tara Fitzgerald. Additionally, she interprets her as a woman who is often short-tempered and fierce, instead of sweet and lovable; as a viewer your sometimes ask yourself why Gilbert falls in love with her at all.

Arthur's companions are very important in the novel, but in the film their characterisation is very two-dimensional and they mostly seem to merge with the background, although the film is really long enough and would not have needed to be shortened on such important matters respectively characters. Helen's own friends, in particular Hattersley's later wife, the gentle, meek Milicent, and the self-assured Esther, appear only at the fringes and do not really play a role here. The entanglement around Lord Lowborough and Arthur's love affair with Lowborough's wife are wholly omitted, although they are very important in the novel. Hargrave, another example for a man who tortures Helen and does not acknowledge her for being herself, is also portrayed by far too wanly; and Gilbert is seen as an uncontrolled, impulsive man, so that as a viewer you can't but ask yourself why he of all people is supposed to be a better mate for Helen.

Same thing as usual - quality pays the toll to the advantage of clichs, and the plot does not become more interesting for that, on the contrary. Instead of actually reading the book, the producers have limited themselves to filter the book's most dramatic highlights, to invent a few new ones and to garnish all of it with nice pictures and settings and popular actors.
A pity! I hope that this novel will sooner or later be turned into a film in a way that does it justice, because this film version definitively didn't come up to it.",1394323200,4,4601,4.676543209876543

Toby Stevens is charming, as usual, but doesn't get as much screen time as I would have liked because I'd seen him in Jane Eyre and thought he was fantastic!  Unfortunately, Tara Fitzgerald, while staying faithful to the character, Helen, seems to have a harshness to her personality that the character in the book does not have.  In the book, Helen seems much more wide-eyed and naive than Tara Fitzgerald can pull off.  Regardless, it is well-done and I will watch it over again.",1390521600,3,854,4.4423076923076925

I was so excited when I sat down to watch this movie version and was absolutely disgusted by the end. There is no rape in the novel version, and there is no reason for it in the movie version. Yes, spousal rape occurred in Victorian England, and yes, it still occurs today, but that is not something Anne Bronte would have written about nor did she.

This film adaptation bowls me over.  Beside it, Tarantino and Scorsese are weak.  Somehow Tara Fitzgerald is able to 'grow' on screen from a blamelessly silly young woman to a bitterly experienced adult, and survives with no easy sudden solutions or evasions.  This must be her greatest role. Just one of the brief early scenes that had me rooted to my seat is when she challenges the bullying churchman, to his face, eye to eye, her voice not held back. This was 1848 for heaven's sake, and Anne Bronte had the guts to write it! The unrelenting strain between personal happiness, cruel marital suffering, and deep morality is so well directed.  Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntington is one of the most authentic psychopaths in film, and his ""enabling"" friends make one nauseous, because we know them today.  Supporting actors are terrific; I loved Paloma Baeza as Gilbert's witty sister, and the brutal Reverend Millward of Kenneth Cranham. For a 21st century audience it is awesome to follow Helen's committed and enduring care of her vile dying husband who is, as she insists, her husband.  Tara Fitzgerald superbly hits all the right notes, is convincing throughout, and like all great actors, says it with her face as much as with the script.  Two and a half hours; what a journey.

The movie, in my opinion, could've been better if the story was more developed with her life with her husband besides all the abuse. I found myself very depressed with the movie afterwards.  It is a sad story and they did a good job portraying the abusive husband, but I felt they focused so much on that they left out a lot of the story with other characters from the book.

The acting is solid, with Tara Fitzgerald an edgy but still empathetic heroine. But
Rupert Graves' switch from flawless seducer to ""worst man in the world"" type villain
is a bit over the top, although that may be the material, or approach more than
performance. Indeed, at times I could feel Graves (a very good actor) trying to
maintain some humanity under the almost gothic heartlessness.

I was not disappointed although a short miniseries never really covers a novel in the most comprehensive way.  There were also a lot of liberties taken to make it more palatable for the viewing audience--some bedroom scenes, wife abuse scenes, garden trysts, and so on.  Rupert Graves as the idle, irresponsible, conniving and cruel Arthur Huntington was spot on in this role.  He even looked sinister with the kohl rimmed eyes giving off a malicious look. Toby Stephens as Gilbert Markham was depicted as the kind, country gentleman who also charms the local vicars daughter and is a loyal son, brother, and the type of guy who would always have your back.  The lovely Tara Fitzgerald was well cast as Helen, a very strong, principled woman who flees to Wildfell Hall to escape a very bad situation.

They are young, impressionable, and looking to marry for affection, but what they discover is that men aren't necessarily bred to feel the same. There are happy endings for some and bittersweet ones for the others.

923251,4,6304645635,"Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was bold for its time, tackling taboo topics such as domestic violence and female emancipation. Not as well known as her other two sisters, Emily (who wrote Wuthering Heights), and Charlotte (who wrote Jane Eyre), Anne's novel is nevertheless an important work, and well worth a read.

This 1996 BBC adaptation stars Tara Fitzgerald as Helen Graham, an attractive woman who appears to be very secretive, keeping quietly to herself when she arrives in the guise of a widow at Wildfell Hall, in 19th century Yorkshire. Together with her young son, Helen attempts to maintain a low profile, a futile effort as her very presence arouses the locals' suspicions, resulting in malicious gossip. It is only at the insistence of a local gentleman farmer, Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), that Helen reveals the agonizing secrets of her past and the life of corruption that she fled for her sake, as well as her young son's.

The production qualities are quite well done, with beautiful shots of the picturesque English countryside, and though the soundtrack isn't exactly inspiring, the talented cast more than makes up for any deficiencies in the production. This is well worth a watch for those who are fans of well-made period dramas, and a must-watch for fans of the Bronte sisters' works.",1325894400,,1326,4.995475113122172

923253,5,6304645635,"Every ounce the creative literary genius that her sisters were, Anne Bronte is too often the unsung Bronte sister. `Agnes Grey' is certainly a solidly written work of Anne's, full of many interesting details to enjoy; but since I first found and read `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' a number of years ago (in my search for all writings Bronte), I couldn't understand why that story of the mystery tenant wasn't every ounce the classic hit that `Jane Eyre' and `Wuthering Heights' had become. I don't mean to diminish the stellar writing styles and heights of either Charlotte or Emily Bronte, it's just that I simply cannot understand why Anne's equally marvelous writing has been so very overlooked, over time.

I realize that some of the `other' (what some might call lesser) Bronte works don't quite have the romantic punch of `Jane Eyre' and `Wuthering Heights', but `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' surely does. (And a little tweaking by a good movie maker could make most Bronte works, work as romance dramas anyway.) Anne's `Tenant' tale is along the same lines as `Eyre' and `Wuthering', though perhaps not quite as melodramatic as those two classic stars by Charlotte and Emily. One thing that I find so compelling about `Tenant' is the realistic look at a substance-addicted selfish cheating abuser, and Anne writes that scenario as if she lived it closely and personally. (yes, her brother lived something like that kind of self-indulgent life and surely she drew from his sad example, and she did work around other people whom she might have drawn bad or good examples from, but she was a spinster who died young) Beyond the `gritty for those times' part of the story, there is enough of the romantic in `Tenant' to make any romantically inclined woman swoon. The `Tenant' has the romantic goods: the lady, her hero, and their true love story. `Tenant' has quickly become one of my top favorite novels, alongside `Eyre' (which has been a cherished favorite of mine for more than forty years) and several Jane Austen novels that are favorites to many women.

There is such amazing writing in most (if not all, as far as I can recall) the Bronte Novels: many sentences that I must stop to read at least twice because they are so perfectly done. Even though I'm much more wired to be focused on the character-driven details rather than anything that remotely approaches purple prose or flowery fiction; the Bronte sisters' descriptives that paint scenes with skillful choices of words, make me stop and repeat for at least the second read through. But then again, I reread many of the Bronte sisters sentences. I am often thoroughly amazed at their skill with the English language. And then there is French and German in some of their prose as well (perhaps only Charlotte and Emily's). Yes, beyond their innate creative genius, they were definitely well educated (primed for the higher class governess trade, or to teach in better schools). I can confidently say that all three of the Bronte sisters win my utmost admiration for their highest levels of literature, and Anne Bronte stands as a true equal to her sisters in her winning effort of `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'.

This movie of `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' with Toby Stevens and Tara Fitzgerald is a great introduction to Anne Bronte's amazing story and I hope it will point many people to her original masterpiece. (Make sure you get an unabridged copy, because my first read-through of the book was mistakenly an abridged version and that one felt quite disjointed and unfinished in a slightly distracting way. Something was missing, and I knew it. I've learned to always look for the `unabridged' stamp because in the case of these kinds of classics, there is nothing like the original.),  If you've read `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' novel or  listened to the audio-book once, twice or thrice, you will know how compressed this story is in the movie. Yes, of course the story had to be compressed to fit into the movie timeframe, though it is not a short movie for certain. One thing that stood out to me about the movie relative to the book is that certain aspects of the nasty husband are intensified: more harsh than the book, I would say. While the movie might not be exactly ideal for some younger ladies (such as young teens), the book is tamer and cleaner in that regard. Still, this movie helps tell the cautionary tale to teen girls and young women of some good reasons why not to marry such a `fixer-upper'. Toby Stevens does as excellent job as the hero and Tara Fitzgerald is equally superb as the heroine. I suppose Rupert Graves deserved kudos for his part, because he did make me hate him, and the abusive husband is definitely a hateful character, though perhaps not quite so thoroughly horrid and devilish in the book. After repeated viewings (and readings and listenings), I do find that I want to skip over the mid-section of the story, because I find it depressing and I want to jump towards the happy ending. All in all, I do highly recommend this movie, though I recommend the book and the Alex Jennings audio-book version all the more.",1322179200,18,5130,4.759550561797753

Also, where was her brother when she needed his help.  They dragged out the abuse for way too long.  I would have turned it off but I couldn't stop it on such a negative note.

Usually this works well, although occasionally it gets self conscious (a couple too
many 360 shots).

The acting is solid, with Tara Fitzgerald an edgy but still empathetic heroine.  But
Rupert Graves' switch from flawless seducer to ""worst man in the world"" type villain
is a bit over the top, although that may be the material, or approach more than
performance.  Indeed, at times I could feel Graves (a very good actor) trying to
maintain some humanity under the almost gothic heartlessness.

The music is interesting and effectively anachronistic as well, often sounding
something the Cocteau Twins, but as with the cinematography after a while it
starts to get both repetitive and too self consciously avant-garde for a story
mostly told in a straightforward Masterpiece Theater fashion.

Lastly, the tidy ending bothered me a bit.  The film did a good enough job capturing
the complex difficulties of life, that I found myself wish for something that felt more
honestly open ended.

All that said, I still enjoyed the story, the scenery, and being transported into another time
and place as only good storytelling can do.  A quite good adaptation, I just wished it was
great, and for 30 minutes or so, thought it might be.",1317945600,,1390,4.931330472103005
923257,5,6304645635,"Tara Fitzgerald is excellent in the role of an aloof, unsociable, misunderstood mother, and professional artist with a mysterious past. Our heroine flees with her adorable, young son to a small hamlet, and settles into a musty, remote cottage. The townspeople attempt to extend their welcome, but she is unable or unwilling to reciprocate, preferring her own company and her work. Surprisingly, one of the townsmen seems to find her contradictions fascinating, and her defenses intriguing. He falls in love with her, and she with him. However, confused by her behavior, he makes an unfortunate character assessment of another man whom he considers his rival. At this point, our heroine seems to realize that even though his behavior has become problematical, she cares and sympathizes with him. By way of explanation, she hands him her journal and dares him to read it! As her journal is reenacted, in flashback, the real story begins. The author tantalizingly peels away clues with skill and suspense. For those who enjoy a well-executed mystery and romance, this wonderful version of Anne Bronte's tale won't disappoint.",1317859200,3,1122,5.204419889502763

923260,4,6304645635,"I just finished watching this miniseries.  I have never read the book, so I cannot compare it with that, but I very much enjoyed the miniseries.  However, there is one point near the beginning of the third and final episode (at about the 12:20 mark) where I got confused and thrown off for the rest of the movie; it wasn't until later when I went back to rewatch that part that I discovered where my understanding had gone off track.  I'll explain what happened below (spoiler alert).

...At about the 12:20 mark into the third and final episode, Gilbert Markham is in a coach, going to see Helen who has returned to her husband Arthur Huntingdon (after her husband sent someone to retrieve/abduct her son Arthur, Jr.).  In the coach, Markham is reading the book/diary Helen has given to him.  He reads, with her voice-over, ""So began the final chapter of our marriage...""  What it is very easy to miss is that the scenes that follow are picking up the flashback to the time BEFORE Helen has fled from Arthur -- i.e., picking up the flashback once again right after the scene from Episode 2 in which Arthur said that if Helen ran away, he would always find her.  However, I got confused, and thought that this ""final chapter of our marriage"" was taking place after Helen had returned, and was picking up right after the scene that ended at the 11:30 mark of Episode 3 where Helen brings her son into her sick husband's room.  This led to all sorts of confusion on my part, with me ultimately thinking that Helen had fled and returned twice or something.  (Which of course led to more questions: ""What was the point of her having her husband sign away the care of Arthur, Jr., when he then starts giving him wine, having him hunt birds, etc.?  When was it that she left the first time; where did she go? etc."")

My guess is that the problem stemmed from a desire on the part of the writers to end the second episode with the cliffhanger in which Helen's son is being abducted, more or less.  This seems to have necessitated their delaying a huge chunk of the flashbacks until the third episode, and thus putting pre-flight scenes AFTER post-return scenes.  I'd say it was a bad choice.  Even if one doesn't get confused at the point where I did, it's still a bit odd to invert the scenes with her husband that way.",1311120000,,2313,4.473809523809524
923350,5,6304645635,"This is another wonderful BBC period romance/drama based on the book by Anne Bronte. The well-cast actors do a great job.

Helen, an affluent society woman arrives in a rural farming town in widow's attire with her little boy.  She is reserved and reclusive, so the local folk are very curious about her and a bit disapproving. However, Gilbert, a handsome, charismatic farmer takes a strong interest in her. Although she is cold at first, she warms up to him bit by bit. They become friends, then more then friends in their feelings towards each other; but there is something that hold's Helen back that she is unable to divulge to Gilbert or anyone.

The local folk begin making presumptions about Helen's character and ""I dare say"" the gossip abounds and the community including the Vicar, all judge her harshly and begin to snub her. Gilbert defends her while knowing she IS hiding some secret, even from him and tries to get her to talk about her burdens.  It is not clear what happened to her and her boy for half the movie; but there are several flash backs to some dark memories.

The movie is a bit of puzzle that unfolds slowly and comes together at the end, with some twists and surprises.  What happened to Helen in the past?  Will she and Gilbert who clearly come to love each, ever get together? Alternatively, will Gilbert marry the village girl he was keen on up until Helen appeared on the scene?

This movie will not disappoint BBC fans.",1310774400,2,1455,4.590733590733591
923351,2,6304645635,"I enjoy the genre of BBC's period pieces however not all are great, good or even pretty good.  This particular drama was depressing and not really entertaining.

923352,3,6304645635,"For the first time I am writing a review on a novel-based film about which I have not read the book. I feel as though if I had, there would have been much more understood about the storyline and the dramatic and intense moments that I completely missed out on. I give this movie three stars because of that - it was an interesting story, well-acted, and well put together, but left enough out for me to be a little confused at the end.

The story is very dark and mysterious, centering around a widow and her young son who take up residency in Wildfell Hall. The lady is unknown to the townsfolk and once invited into company acts very coldly and is therefore perceived to be unfriendly and rude. She is very protective of her son and apparently just wants to be left to herself.

Unfortunately this is a draw to a young man in the village, who befriends and falls in love with her. She is loath to explain her conduct and behavior and as the townspeople's opinion of her is further tarnished - they are convinced she is living a depraved life, particularly now with the young man's repeated solo visits - she appears to be a condemned and avoided woman, until suddenly she disappears.

The story only darkens and saddens from that point, but I suppose it can be said that it has a brighter ending. Not a happy one, but a brighter one.

I recommend watching it only after you've read the novel. You may enjoy it more.",1305590400,,1417,4.376425855513308

923354,4,6304645635,"Opinion is divided on this movie, and I think it's partly because its tone veers from the romanticism of the better known Bronte tales ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Wuthering Heights."" It's a realistic, stark account of the powerlessness of women within marriage in Victorian England, specifically a marriage dominated by an abusive, alcoholic husband. I found Helen Graham's story very compelling, though you should be aware that some of the scenes of abuse are awful to watch. It is slow-moving, and I agree with others that Tara Fitzgerald's manner is sometimes too harsh. In the book, Helen is always a sympathetic character. But there are also moments when Fitzgerald's performance and those of the other actors are just superb. Rupert Graves as Helen's husband Arthur is truly scary. It's a difficult, dark subject that the movie handles well.

Anne Bronte's book is beautifully written and, I think, underappreciated. One critic made the case for ""Tenant"" in this way: for every dashing, romantic hero like Heathcliffe in ""Wuthering Heights"" and Rochester in ""Jane Eyre,"" there are a dozen Arthur Huntingdons, the cruel husband in ""Tenant."" I'm not sure the ratio is correct (I hope it's not!) but his point was that Helen's story reflects the real condition of many women and has a valuable lesson to tell.

I will add that the story is not as irredeemably depressing as it sounds! Pulsing throughout the book and the movie is the theme of Helen's moral clarity and centeredness. Helen's moral courage saves her and her child and might have saved Huntingdon. Pious characters are often held up to ridicule these days, but Helen Graham makes piety admirable. It is also the story of the gentleman farmer Gilbert Markham, who bears witness to Helen's travails. His steadfast devotion to her is challenged but ultimately rewarded.",1301356800,5,1822,5.04983388704319

While this is a largely tragic story to begin with, at least in reading it, you can find some bits of joy here and there, which offset what is otherwise a pretty miserable situation the primary character (Tara Fitzgerald) is exposed to. I know about the weather in Northern England, but the sun DOES shine there sometimes. Apparently, the director chose not to shoot on any sunny days. While the scenics are beautiful, when they are only used on overcast days with low contrast film stock, they don't really offer much. Nice set design, costumes, and some good acting are what made me give this 2 stars and not one. Even if you are some sort of always upbeat person, this production will probably bring you down. IF you like it visually, there is still the music to be dealt with. Frequent violin, and sometimes flute music, with long, drawn out, somber notes, add to the misery. Don't show this DVD to anyone who is already depressed, or it will probably be the last thing they ever watch, if you know what I mean. I have the impression that the first day on the set, the director said ""OK, no one is allowed to smile until after the wrap party"" and apparently, no one did, until the film was in the can. I understand that this is supposed to be drama, not comedy, but just as some comedies do not represent real life because they are too silly, this did not represent real life for being too joyless. I don't think that during weeks when I had close relatives die, that I was ever as miserable as many of the people in this movie.",1298678400,6,1592,4.381756756756757

Toby Stephens was excellent in the role of Gilbert Markham, but the other two main characters left something to be desired.  The villain Huntingdon, played by Rupert Graves, was neither handsome enough nor wicked enough to portray the tempting, devilish, malicious and utterly evil fiend described in the book.  Similarly, Tara Fitzgerald was neither beautiful enough, nor multi-facted enough to portray the complex female lead of Mrs. Graham, who must be reserved yet warm, controlled yet fierce, pious yet forgiving, pitiable yet strong, and ultimately someone we come to love.  The actress did not inspire that, nor did the script.  If you've never read the book but enjoy BBC productions, you'll probably enjoy this one just as well as any other.

Unlike many people who gave the film adaptation a 5-star rating, I have actually read ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" in full. The penguin edition of the novel is 489 pages - considerably longer than Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice."" Unfortunately, the scriptwriter did not feel that it was acceptable to create a truly wonderful and well-developed mini-series from the novel. Instead, the film is a SHELL with no juicy plot inside.

Now, I am not saying that some people (especially people who are not literary scholars, but rather individuals who enjoy love stories) might not find the film interesting. I am simply saying that I was bored by the production.

ANALYSIS:
In the 1970s and even 1980s, BBC miniseries were often produced using much of the original language from the novel (see Jane Eyre 1973 or 1983, Pride and Prejudice 1980, & Oliver Twist 1985).  Many of the miniseries followed the novel very closely. They had simply the agenda of conveying the book in drama. In some regard, these films were like a play. Often cameras were situated in a position where editing was at a minimal. Furthermore, in these miniseries, minor characters were well developed.

Since the late 1990s, films have been overedited, and minor characters have been forgotten (Hargrave rarely gets any screen time, Ralph and Helen Hattersley along with Lord Lowborough and Mr. Grimsby are forgotten, and Helen's live before marriage to Arthur is not portrayed.). In essence, the focus of this film is very limited. Since I have read the novel, this makes the film very boring. Furthermore, some elements of plot are altered (for example: the time, place, and context of Gilbert's confrontation with Frederick Lawrence).

True, changes were made from the original plot to adapt it to screen; but those changes do not inherently alter the plot and/or spirit of the work - those changes primarily consist of some added scenes that are implied rather than described, and also a changing of Helen returning to Wildfell Hall after Arthur Huntingdon's death rather than Gilbert going to seek her at her uncle's house.  And some lessening of some of the subplots and dialogue.  On the whole however, all the performances are excellent and each actor played the part as described by Bronte to perfection.  Toby Stephens and Tara Fitzgerald are truly excellent as Gilbert and Helen Huntingdon/""Mrs. Graham"" - the Tenant of Wildfell - who has escaped her debauched, abusive husband to try and rear her son away from the contaminating influence of his father.  BUT the performance that stands far and away above the others is Rupert Graves as Huntingdon - while the others are excellent - his is something like a volcano erupting on the screen.  I have NEVER seen such an amazing acting performance in my entire life by ANYONE as his performance as Huntingdon.  He plays Huntingdon's sociopathic reactive attachment disordered personality to perfection!!!!  I was completely amazed and blown away by it and thought about it for many days afterward.

What follows is a three-part series, chronicling Mrs. Graham's horrible sham of a marriage to an alcoholic misogynist expertly played by Rupert Graves. Without giving away too much of the plot, each scene intensifies the brutality of Graham's marriage: the verbal abuse, marital rape, and adultery she experiences allthewhile trying to shield her son from his fathers' sadistic behavior.

What the DVD misses is the bleakness and the loneliness and mysteriousness of Helen's situation on her own -- a single woman on her own was desperately threatening in those days -- everything in this film is busy all the time.  One longs for just a minute or two of stillness -- but you can't do that on TV these days.  The chattering and swooping just cuts into the moodiness that the book, with all its overdoneness, still evokes.  The part of Gilbert is hell to do, and I found Stephens boring, but Gilbert is pretty boring all round.  Rupert Graves was excellent:  you could just see how impossible it was to leave him, and how prissy Helen could be.  Another thing you can't do much of these days is religion, but her struggle with Huntington over his soul was, for Anne, probably the most important part of the book -- and needed to be emphasized more. My only strong reservation about Tara Fitzgerald was her pulledback hairdo.

The lead female, played by Tara Fitzgerald, is almost repulsive in her abrasive and aloof character at first... but then as you discover her story, you are heartened by her strength and courage.
 Rupert Graves is convincingly detestable in his role as the lover, turned abusive and monstrous husband. He plays the role to the tee, and adds (in the disturbing flashback scenes) an almost creepy edge to the film.  The fact that these flashbacks involve a child that Fitzgerald is protecting, makes them all the more unnerving.

I found the film to be engrossing - You cringe to watch the deplorable abuses and yet yearn to discover how things happened and where they will end.  You view from several vantage points, the misconceptions of relationships - and how differently people define ""the benefits of marriage.""

Excellently acted, not outdone by scenery and costuming, but wonderfully produced from start to finish.  Although definitely a darker film, this is a British period peice worth watching!",1230854400,4,1183,4.974619289340102

I wanted to see more of Toby Stephens' work after being blown away by his performance as Edward Rochester in the BBC's 2006 version of ""Jane Eyre"".  I checked out the video cassette from my public library several times before the DVD became available earlier this year.

Since seeing the series I've read the book by Anne Bronte several times.  The deviations from the book don't bother me that much - I feel the series is true to the spirit of the book that Anne Bronte wrote.  The cast was excellent.  I particularly enjoyed Gilbert Markham's interactions with his mother and sister.  The series gradually reveals, through flashbacks, the background of the mysterious and severe Mrs. Graham.  I first saw Rupert Graves in ""The Forsyte Saga"" and enjoyed his performance so much.  Here, he's a completely different kind of character - self-centered and manipulative.  It is only as a last resort that Helen leaves Huntingdon - she does her best to be a good wife to him in the manner of the time.

There's great chemistry between Stephens and Fitzgerald. Helen's and Gilbert's admiration and attraction for one another grows subtly as the story unfolds.  Their friendship and quiet enjoyment of one another in the bleak landscape is so appealing.  Gilbert befriends Mrs. Graham even as the suspicious townsfolk begin to turn against her, and it's this unwavering (mostly!) support that makes Gilbert so admirable.  I thoroughly enjoyed this series and the story.",1228608000,3,1663,5.4453125

923679,3,6304645635,"""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" a feature-length 1996 television costume drama produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, was seen here on broadcast TV in 1997.  It was based upon the little-known book of the same name, published in 1848, by the Victorian-era British author Anne Bronte.  She is the least-known of the three famous Bronte sisters, all of whom specialized in moody works set on England's scenic moors, upon which they were raised.  Emily Bronte, of course, gave us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wuthering-Heights/dp/1593081286/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wuthering Heights </a>; Charlotte,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B001Q3LSXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>. And some of us probably can't help thinking that were Anne not a Bronte, this work would neither have survived, nor have been adapted for television, as it's rather heavy going.

It concerns Helen Huntingdon, in flight from an alcoholic, brutal, but wealthy and high-status husband, Arthur Huntington.  She has taken her young son Arthur, and taken up residence, as the dour and mysterious Mrs. Helen Graham, in a rundown Hall on the moors.  It's not long before a handsome young yeoman farmer of the vicinity, Gilbert Markham, takes an interest in her, and her son.  It's also not long before malicious gossip about her begins to circulate around the isolated village to which she has moved.

Much of the movie is set on the moors, and it has received the typical lush BBC treatment in the matters of location shooting, costumes, set decoration, carriages, etc.  Unfortunately, while the camera whirls around and around, it doesn't succeed in making the production any less static.  Mind you, I see where some other reviewers have complained about gratuitous scenes of sex and violence thrown in; but some of us may find them a bit of a relief.  And the frequent flashbacks can be a major source of confusion.

Furthermore, let's be perfectly clear about this: the underlying 1848 book was an important early proto-feminist document.  I've not read it for many a year, but its filmed treatment lays out mercilessly the frustrating, restricted lives of women at that time, ranging from suffering under benign domestic tyranny, to their extreme difficulties in making independent livings, or living independently, to the fact that, upon marriage, a woman, her money, and any children she might have, became the property of her husband.  On those grounds, book, and any treatment thereof deserve respect.  But surely not affection.

Tara Fitzgerald (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waking-the-Dead/dp/B001GTXZOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waking the Dead</a>); stars as Helen: she's a beautiful woman, high of cheekbone; her beauty survives even a possibly historically accurate, but surely unfortunate hairdo.  She's also a very likable actress; it was an excellent idea to cast her as the not-easy-to-like Helen, preachy, holier-than-thou, and severe. In fact, Helen can perhaps best be compared to the 20th century American figure Carrie Nation.  Many of us may agree that Ms. Nation's heart was in the right place.  She was a suffragist; she opposed the consumption of alcohol because she thought it had many undesirable results.  And let's say we're in agreement with her: still,Carrie with her axe, laying waste to bars, in support of Prohibition,could not have been a pleasant sight.  And, at times, Helen Huntingdon seems only to lack the axe.  (So let us not forget that  Bronte pere was a clergyman, and, in fact, must have been one tough old bird: in his seventies, one day, he drank down a bottle of brandy, then submitted to what must have been an excruciatingly painful cataract operation.)  Well, anyway, a modern audience may have trouble deciding who'd be most unpleasant to live with, Helen; or her hell-bound husband Arthur.  As beautifully played by the handsome Rupert Graves  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-for-Vendetta/dp/B000FS9FCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V for Vendetta </a>); he clearly is dissolute, and will come to an early, bad end; but he's charismatic, recognizes his own limitations; gives every sign of having a sense of humor, even about himself.  (It seems likely that the author modeled him on the fourth Bronte child, the only boy, Branwell.  That weak young Bronte, son of a clergyman and in a household of brilliant women, was an alcoholic, an opium eater, and died at age 31.)

Toby Stephens (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B000LPQ6DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre </a>)  is a handsome, sexy Gilbert Markham, yearning to lighten up Helen and her life: he lights up quite a few scenes.

923761,5,6304645635,"Wow, what an intense, dark Gothic romance!  A mysterious, beautiful widow with a past arrives with her son to a nosey, judgemental countryside town.  A past that is slowly unraveled with the pryings of a handsome, obsessed suitor.

The actors are superb: Tara Fitzgerald(Helen), whom I simply adore as an actress, as the long suffering, fiel heroine with a lesson to learn and a son to protect, Rupert Graves(Arthur)as the depraved, never changing, rogue, 'Byron' whom she can't stop loving, and Toby Stephens(Gilbert) as the impetuous, immature, hero whom she wants to love, although cautiously.

The director often shoots the scenes with sweeping, revolving panoramas about his actors, scenery desolate and wistful, the sets, costumes, and locations simply captivating and fitting for the mood.

For whatever reason, I've always favored Anne, the youngest of the talented but tragic Bronte family.  She watched as three of her sisters including Emily, die from disease, her mother probably from uterine cancer and her 'shamed-the-family' brother deteriorate from alcohol.  Anne died in her 29th year. Her sister, Charlotte, died 6 years later at the ripe old age of 39.

Anne loved to write poetry, but she also did two novels.  Her first,'Agnes Grey', which I wish some enlightened soul would make into a great movie, was lighter than 'The Tenant' with some Jane Austen-like contrivances and humor.  The story involved a governess reminescent of Anne's experience in child care. Charlotte didn't appreciate Austen and somewhat poo-pooed her 'baby' sister's work, but, nevertheless, took Anne's idea of a governess and ran with it in 'Jane Ayre'.

'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' was Anne's jaunt into realism with a tough and disturbing tale about both the self-centerness of men who controlled everything in the world and the plight of women caught in their domain.  It apparently shocked the Victorian moralists of the day to have a novel about a woman standing up to her husband, shutting the sacred bedroom door to him and doing whatever to free herself.

Anne ends the tale with a strong catharsis, and I would say an optimism (Austen-like? ""Charlotte, just get over it!"") that I believe represents her own determined and uplifting nature even in a difficult and short, earthly stay.  The movie makers provide an ending keeping, I think, in the spirit of Bronte; however, the  overall journey  really stresses one out, but then is quite satisfying.  Moral: choose your partners well.

But a few hours after the snow ended it became black from the ash. Not exactly the scene from a Christmas card.

There were four sets of railroad tracks between our house and the river, and the trains ran all the time carrying war materiels.

A widow named Helen Graham--played skillfully by Tara Fitzgerald, along with her young son, move into an old estate and attempt to just live day to day, minding their own business.  The townspeople however, are very curious about the rather aloof newcomer and her overprotectiveness of her son.  Helen is a self dependant woman who sells her paintings to make a living, and does not wish to let strangers come too close.  One of the townspeople, Gilbert Markham--played by the ever handsome Toby Stephans, can not help but be drawn to Helen and wishes to learn more about her.  Helen hides a secret and eventually she shares it with Gilbert.  Helen is not the widow as she portrays.  She is married to a complete rake of a man, Arthur Huntingdon-played by the talented Rupert Graves, who has never been totally faithful to her. Arthur takes off months at a time to carouse with his buddies, leaving Helene alone to raise their infant son.  Later, when their son is a little older, the alcoholic Arthur and his band of goon friends force the boy to drink-which he promptly throws up-to make the boy become, ""a man"".  Arthur then hires a governess to teach the boy as punishment to Helen, keeping her away from the son she loves dearly, as she begins to despise what Arthur is doing to himself, their son and their marriage.  Finally having endured enough of Arthur's abuse and fearing for the safety and well being of her son, she, her maid and son make a mad dash to freedom and arrive at Wildfell Hall, where she assumes the dress of a widow to stay in hiding.  By the time Gilbert understands all that Helen has been through, Arthur has discovered where she is and brought her and their son back to their home.  There Helen stays, being faithful as always to her husband, and taking a stand against his abuse and infidelity.  Arthur is now gravely ill from years of alcohol and debauchery and Helen fires the governess, who was also an enabler to Arthur's alcoholism.  One of Arthur's friend's tries to put the moves on Helen, but she rebuffs him, telling him she made a promise to her husband to be faithful and for the man to never come back again. Gilbert comes to rescue her, telling her she is too good for her husband, but Helen is an honest, righteous woman, and though she cares for Gilbert, she can not, nor will not, cheat on her husband.  Eventually Arthur dies and Helen and her son return to Wildfell Hall.  ****SPOILER ALERT****  On the way to the hall, they spot a wedding reception going on in town and Helen sees Gilbert talking and laughing with a bride.  She assumes Gilbert got tired of waiting for her and married, and is saddened by this.  Gilbert is told by one of the guests at the reception that they saw Helen ride by in her coach.  He rushes off to see her and asks about her husband.  She tells him he has died and tells Gilbert congratulations on his wedding.  He explains that it wasn't he who got married but someone else.

I am a big fan of the novel, which I think is underrated (it's poorly structured but very original, if a little school-girlish at times). This film follows the book pretty closely -- the ending is a little different but in the spirit of the book.

Toby Stephens' Gilbert was beautiful and compelling (& he does a good northern accent), but his performance here doesn't have quite the zing of Jane Eyre because of Tara Fitzgerald's failure to respond to him. (Half of Ruth Wilson's performance in Jane Eyre is her Nancy-Reaganish adoring gaze at Toby, which enhances him greatly.) I was more drawn to the scenes of Toby and his sister, whose scenes were more touching because it seemed like she was more sympathetic to him. Actually Tara's problem may have been following the book too closely -- you don't really get why Helen & Gilbert fall in love in the book, and you don't really get it in the film either. You certainly see that there are good reasons Helen comes off as cold and disgusted with men, both in the book and the film. I think Tara could have cheated a little on this aspect of the character and responded more to Toby so the love story would make more sense (the scriptwriter could have helped by drawing this out more too).

Rupert Graves was pretty good as Huntingdon, but his kissing was so gross it's amazing Helen doesn't dump him straight away. Actually, the solution to the film's lack of spark may have been to cast Graves as Gilbert and Toby as Huntingdon -- Toby's knack for playing bad guys would have found a wide field in this character.",1179187200,10,1683,4.588039867109635

An intriguing widow woman of mystery, Helen Graham (Tara Fitzgerald), moves into a crumbling residence known as Wildfell Hall. There, she sets up house with her very young son. Plain spoken, independent, and seeming to lack charm, she rebuffs the initial, friendly overtures of the local townsfolk and manages to alienate most of them. Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), a young and handsome yeoman farmer, is not put off by her manner, however, and being smitten by her, pursues her, hoping to gain her affections. Soon, however, the townsfolk begin gossiping about her supposed assignations with a wealthy, local gentleman, Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy), the owner of Wildfell Hall. There comes a point where even the steadfast Mr. Markham wavers in his belief in her. It is then that Mrs. Graham tells him the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Lawrence and reveals her dark past.

Rupert Graves steals the show as Arthur Huntingdon, the charming rake who captures and seduces Helen's young, romantic heart. Once married to her, however, he reveals himself to be a brutish, dissolute, and depraved philanderer, who causes her to flee their home with their young son. The role of Huntingdon is, undoubtedly, the juiciest. The film uses the narrative contrivance of flashbacks in order to explain the events that led Helen to take the extraordinary measures that she did. It tells the viewer of the sad story that brought Helen and her son to this sorry pass. Ultimately, Helen takes the high road, when an event occurs that causes her past to collide with her present. In that decision, however, lies the key to her future.

Toby Stephens is wonderful as the yeoman farmer, whose tender heart is captured by the beautiful Helen. Tara Fitsgerald, while indeed beautiful, plays the role of Helen a tad too harshly, which, while serving to alenate the townsfolk, serves also to alienate the viewer somewhat.

I have read the book and though there are several differences, by whole the movie brought the book to life in a wonderful way.

923928,4,6304645635,"If you are a fan of the gentlile Austen productions then this may not be your cup of tea, the Bronte novels were always grittier and harsher, speaking of struggle and cruelty towards women of the time. This is not exactly a faithful representation, modern audience pleasing devices are used to give the story a hook. Sometimes this is necessary with Victorian novel adaptaions as issues which where then shocking now barely raise an eyebrow, but I think not so with Bronte work, the gritty realism of times past in their novels is actually more shocking now for it's utter cruelty. For my money, adding modern twists for hook value cheapens the work.

 Nonetheless, Graves is excellent and steals the show, Stevens is perfect as the romantic hereo but Fitzgerald is just a little too harsh, cold and unconvinsing. I had little connection, empathy nor sympathy with her characterisation and yet read the novel and the opposite happens, it strikes me she is trying to inject too much of the modern woman into the role which takes a whole dimension away from the character and robs the story.

 Still, worth a shot if only for the male leads.",1120608000,22,1139,4.737373737373737
923929,5,6304645635,"Branwell couldn't have been THIS bad.

In studying the Bronte sisters I find it universally accepted that any male bad-behavior demonstrated in their writings was based upon their experience with brother Branwell's decline and fall due to drink and drugs (opium/laudanum (noun circa 1603

any of various formerly used preparations of opium)). In 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall', his sister Anne has penned what has been called a ...""response to Emily's Wuthering Heights"" showing, I suppose, the proper reaction to such bad behavior as exhibited by Heathcliff. In 'Tenant', Anne's heroine flees in horror and hides out, attempting to support herself and raise her son away from the monster she married. In this terrific production I felt there might have been some censoring of his bad acts but as I have not yet read Anne's novel I cannot be sure. It did raise some questions for me though. There is some dispute about the cause of Branwell's disgrace. Was he dismissed from Thorp Green for seducing his student's mother, as Gaskell believes? Or did he attempt to seduce (or even succeed in seducing) his student, the young boy he was tutoring? Or, as 'Tenant' suggests to me, did he seduce the boy into use of drink and/or drugs. I think this last guess to be the most likely and in viewing this production you may come to agree. Anne was there when he was disgraced. She must have heard all of what he'd done, though she would breathe no word of it. And all she would say was that it was ""..undreamed of experience"" of life.",1117238400,9,1525,4.7293233082706765
923930,1,6304645635,"If you are a true Bronte fan. You will not want to watch this movie. I checked it out at my local library expecting something on the lines of Sense and Sensibility  and soon discovered  that the producers must have lost all sense during the production of this movie. What were they thinking?!! This is not Ann Bronte, it's a producer/director using the name of a book and writing his own story! I couldn't even finish the movie, it was too awful, the flashbacks were bizarre, and finally when it shows her with her ""husband"" ""romancing"" it was too much for this Victorian. After a while you began to count the minutes in between the conversation and people walking around on the screen looking bored! BBC should try reading the books first, that way they can end up with widows, not  prostitutes as the heriones of their next movie.",1113264000,32,832,4.570469798657718
923931,4,6304645635,"I saw this on masterpiece theater and immediately bought the book.  Anne Bronte' was a woman before her time.  She was outspoken at a time when women were always to be quiet and dutiful no matter what their circumstances.

The video keeps to the meat of the story which is dark and mysterious.  The casting was top notch and the scene locations were wonderful as expected with a BBC production.  The video and the book are must for any media collection.",1107648000,8,453,4.54320987654321

923934,4,6304645635,"While not wholly faithful to Anne Bronte's novel of the same name, this adaptation has much to commend it. Excellent cinematography, as well as strong performances by the entire cast, makes this a must see production for all lovers of period pieces.

An intriguing widow woman of mystery, Helen Graham (Tara Fitzgerald), moves into a crumbling residence known as Wildfell Hall. There, she sets up house with her very young son. Plain spoken, independent, and seeming to lack charm, she rebuffs the initial friendly overtures of the local townsfolk and manages to alienate most of them. Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), a young and handsome yeoman farmer, is not put off by her manner, however, and being smitten by her, pursues her, hoping to gain her affections. Soon, however, the townsfolk begin gossiping about her supposed assignations with a wealthy, local gentleman, Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy), the owner of Wildfell Hall. There comes a point where even the steadfast Mr. Markham wavers in his belief in her. It is then that Mrs. Graham tells him the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Lawrence and reveals her dark past.

Rupert Graves steals the show as Arthur Huntingdon, the charming rake who captures and seduces Helen's young, romantic heart. Once married to her, however, he reveals himself to be a brutish, dissolute, and depraved philanderer, who causes her to flee their home with their young son. The role of Huntingdon is, undoubtedly, the juiciest. The film uses the narrative contrivance of flashbacks in order to explain the events that led Helen to take the extraordinary measures that she did. It tells the viewer of the sad story that brought Helen and her son to this sorry pass. Ultimately, Helen takes the high road, when an event occurs that causes her past to collide with her present. In that decision, however, lies the key to her future.

Toby Stephens is wonderful as the yeoman farmer, whose tender heart is captured by the beautiful Helen. Tara Fitsgerald, while indeed beautiful, plays the role of Helen a tad too harshly, which, while serving to alenate the townsfolk, serves also to alienate the viewer somewhat. Even though the flashbacks serve to explain her present manner, and the viewer sees her in happier days, Helen is still not as simpatico a character as she could or should be. Still, this is a handsome, though somewhat dark and somber production that those who love period pieces will appreciate and enjoy.",1013299200,361,2466,4.980582524271845
923935,5,6304645635,"This dark morality tale of Anne Bronte's is my favorite of all the Bronte novels. It is the only one whose main character (Helen Graham) grew up a light-hearted girl with every advantage in life. Such a person would usually be seen as selfish and weak-willed in other Bronte novels, but as she deals with the new realities of married life, her intellect and spiritual power prove to be formidable. The advantages she was raised with seem to serve her with a deep inner knowledge that the customary place of a wife in Britain at that time is not for her. She does not hide nor apologize for her innocent love and devotion and does not make being a victim cheat her out of her living her own life. Although this rendition of the story is more pessimistic than I felt when reading the novel, I enjoyed it thoroughly and have enjoyed watching it several times. Tara Fitzgerald et al. are superbly cast and the sets and costumes are magnificent.",1012348800,20,940,4.535294117647059

Fitzgerald and Stephens had such chemistry and were the best suited for the parts. However, I believe Graves stole the show as the despicable drunk, Mr Huntingdon. His acting was amazing - he had such eviction and screen presence. Purefoy delivered the part of Mr Lawrence very well for his minimal role which I feel should have been lengthened. The camera angles and music score perfectly established the tone that Bronte expressed in her novel. You must watch this film if you are a Bronte fan.",997660800,11,594,4.833333333333333
923937,5,6304645635,"""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" is based on the Victorian novel by Anne Bronte. It tells the story of secretive, passionate and outspoken Helen Graham who lives quietly with her young son in Wildfell Hall. She befriends a young neighborhood farmer, Gilbert Markham, and he falls in love with her, despite her objections.  It soon unfolds that Helen is ""on the run"" from her privileged life and her cruel, alcoholic husband - Arthur Huntingdon -  and a series of flashbacks tell the story of her life with him.  The story itself is engrossing and, like Jane Eyre, it's ultimately a story of a strong woman overcoming the odds and coming out triumphant in the end.
The BBC has done a great job with this production.  Tara Fitzgerald (""The Woman in White,"" ""Brassed Off"") is perfectly cast as the downtrodden but feisty Helen.  Handsome actors Toby Stephens (""The Great Gatsby"") and Rupert Graves (""Room with a View,"" ""Mrs. Dalloway"") are excellent as the devoted Gilbert and the detestable Huntingdon.  Tara Fitzgerald and Toby Stephens have a chemistry that most would find irresistible.  The performances from the principal actors are excellent and Rupert Graves does such a good job that I found myself hating and pitying him at the same time. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Bronte's work or first-rate British drama.",986428800,133,1325,4.941441441441442
