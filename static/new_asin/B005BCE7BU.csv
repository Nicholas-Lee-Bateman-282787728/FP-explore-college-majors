4643672,5,B005BCE7BU,"This is a thinking person's movie. The main character, Nick, must figure out how to pass the tests that will determine how he will spend eternity.  But before he can do that, he needs to discover what the tests are, using clues provided in songs by his rock idol.  The viewer, too, must figure out what the tests are, and what Nick must do to pass them.  Matthew Jure is excellent as Rex, the rock star, and Carey Peters is great as Beth.  I enjoyed it and found myself thinking and talking about it long after it was over.",1316476800,5,523,4.252525252525253
4643673,5,B005BCE7BU,We really enjoyed this movie.  You should definitely buy it and watch it.  We loved the soundtrack to the movie and the actors were all terrific.,1316476800,3,145,4.538461538461538
4643724,5,B005BCE7BU,"I saw this at a film festival at Wayne State last summer. I wasn't going to stick around to see it, but I am glad I did. Charming cast, great music, a great indy film. Matthew Jure is incredible (why do I not see him in more films??). A sharp and witty screenplay that touches upon the shortcomings of both atheism and religious faith without embracing or insulting either. Great to see Wendy McClendon Covey bringing it in a dramatic role.",1317168000,,440,4.444444444444445
4643725,5,B005BCE7BU,"I saw this film at the Brantford film festival last year. The movie was fun as well as a thought provoking. I enjoyed the different ways that Nick related to the band (mainly Rex) and Beth and ultimately came to understand himself better through those relationships. I found it refreshing that as soon as I thought I'd gotten a grip on where the story was going, it would go somewhere else completely unexpected. That is a rare quality in film these days.

In addition to enjoying the movie, the Director did a Q&A after the film which was also informative and entertaining. It was interesting to hear about all the different aspects of the production from casting to filming. The composer for the movie score was also there which I found an added bonus since the movie had such a musical theme.",1316995200,,795,4.598591549295775
4643726,5,B005BCE7BU,"It's not often that a low-budget flick can elicit such a depth of originality. I caught this movie at the Detroit Independent Film Festival, and was very pleased. The plot of this film is bizarre, unique, sometimes confusing, and ultimately rewarding.

The writer fills the dialog with notes on the afterlife, religion, the entertainment industry, and familial issues. No doubt there's a lot to cover. But it all comes together in a nice package, delivered surprisingly by a washed-up rocker named ""Rex"" (the highlight of the film, by the way). His character drives both the dialog and the music.

I didn't expect to see such extended musical sequences. It was sorta like ""Rocky Horror"" in that regard, but the songs were catchy. The ballad, near the end, was the strongest. They should consider releasing the soundtrack too.

If you're looking for something truly original and are a fan of independent cinema, this one is highly recommended.",1316995200,,942,5.0256410256410255
4643727,5,B005BCE7BU,"Not your run-of-the-mill film about the afterlife, but very intriguing. Grabs hold of you from the outset for a great ride.",1316822400,2,123,4.904761904761905
4643728,5,B005BCE7BU,"I've been fortunate enough to see Starlight and Superfish at the Blue Water Film festival. It features an excellent cast, but the stand out is Matthew Jure. Great music and great performances. A must see for indie film fans.",1316649600,2,224,4.769230769230769
4643729,5,B005BCE7BU,"I caught an an advance screener for this film and really enjoyed it.  Being a bit ambivalent on the existence of heaven, hell and god myself, I could relate to Nick's surprise at his predicament.",1316476800,2,195,4.571428571428571

4643731,5,B005BCE7BU,"Matthew Jure's performance, as an actor and a musician, was extremely good.  I admit my expectations were relatively low when seeing an advance screening of this low budget indie film, but the music was fantastic - especially the infectious ""Say Goodbye.""",1316476800,4,255,5.219512195121951
4643732,5,B005BCE7BU,"Crazy, bizarre, interesting stuff!  You really should see this flick - do what you gotta do.  Great music and acting as well.",1316476800,4,125,4.636363636363637
4643733,5,B005BCE7BU,"I was lucky enough to discover that movie at the DWIFF 2010 and enjoyed it so much. This is a great movie that will please all the fans of Spike Jonze, Wes Anderson, Michel Gondry and colleagues... I'm looking forward to watch it again !!!!",1316476800,3,240,4.355555555555555
8463921,1,B005BCE7BU,"I thought this movie could be interesting, I was sadly very disappointed!  Its extremely corny, the actors are bad and I think I'm just going to toss it in the trash.  Sorry, I just couldn't watch it!",1365465600,,200,4.378378378378378
8463922,5,B005BCE7BU,This movie was recommended to me from a friend.  The writing and plot are fantastic and the production values are surprising good for a small budget indie film.  I would highly recommend to anyone.,1322697600,,197,4.764705882352941
8463923,5,B005BCE7BU,"This film is definitely worthwhile. Surprisingly good low budget movie. Great acting, cool music. I really enjoyed it. Watch it! You won't be sorry. :)",1320192000,,151,5.08
8463924,5,B005BCE7BU,"Starlight & Superfish has the feel of the theatre but the production values of major motion picture.  Nearly the entire movie is filmed in on location so I was focused on the storyline - not the sets.  The cast is able and sincere and looking to act, not just play a role.  Worth a viewing.",1319587200,,290,4.236363636363636
8463925,5,B005BCE7BU,I see very few movies but this is a must rent or buy.  Believable characters and enough substance to hold the attention of almost anyone.,1319587200,,137,4.48
8463926,5,B005BCE7BU,Once I started watching this film I couldn't stop. It reminded me of those films you had to watch in school and then list all the symbolism. Some of the actors looked familier too. A must watch. Oh and the music rocked.,1319587200,,219,4.238095238095238
8463927,5,B005BCE7BU,"definitely recommended! surprised this has not been talked about more! the plot is interesting and definitely holds your attention. For a low-budget film, the acting was really good :) and so was the music! Worth the money and the time watching it.",1319500800,2,248,4.928571428571429

I have recommended it to all my friends, this is a must see movie!!!
Matthew Jure is amasing! Enjoy!",1318982400,,117,4.363636363636363
8463929,5,B005BCE7BU,"I had a chance to see an advance copy of this and it really made me think about how I'm living my life! I love movies that tell stories through quiet moments and characters, without resorting to CGI special effects and all sorts of distractions. That being said, this was photographed (filmed? cinematographed? I don't know what the word is) beautifully and with obvious care. I loved the performances of the leads, too -- nice contrast between a sort of dry-humor everyman and a showy ex- (very ex)-rocker.",1317945600,,507,4.7727272727272725
8463930,5,B005BCE7BU,"...to say this movie changed my life.  Great story, great music, great cast.  Why we haven't seen these actors popping up in more films and television shows is beyond me.",1317427200,,170,4.633333333333334
