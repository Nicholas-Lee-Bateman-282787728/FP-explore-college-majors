7844764,3,6303341047,"Beethoven's Nephew, also ""Beethoven - Die ganze Wahrheit"" [Beethoven - The Whole Truth] (France 1985, by Paul Morrissey) with Wolfgang Reichmann as Beethoven, portrays the uncle as furious and tyrannical, obsessed and insanely jealous. Even though the film elicits a deep sympathy for his torment, it concentrates too much on only one aspect of his life - not surprisingly, given its plot being based on novels (like Magnani 1972).

7844765,3,6303341047,"Independent filmmaker Morrissey sheds his well-deserved reputation as a sensationalistic chronicler of life on the fringe in this thoughtful and opulent story of the destructively possessive relationship between Ludwig Von Beethoven and his handsome nephew. In a rewrite of history, Morrissey shows Beethoven in his later years as a furious and demanding ""superstar"" who, after winning a vicious court battle for the custody of his sister's son, becomes consumed with an insanely jealous love for the boy. With surprising control in its examination of the composer's obsession, the film elicits a deep sympathy for his torment without compromising the severity of his tyrannical grip on the boy's life. The homosexual desire of the muscial genius is palpable, yet never overt. (Filmed in English)",1007596800,12,796,5.479674796747967
