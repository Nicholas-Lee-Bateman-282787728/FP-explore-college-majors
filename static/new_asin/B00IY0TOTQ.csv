8646245,3,B00IY0TOTQ,"The Instruction is Good_the Problem is the DVD Production and format; First; The copy I purchased is just enough out of focus that the interface
details of Zbrush; that the instructor is using are a blur most of the time; Second; The Continual flying graphics and attached sound effects Throughout; over used; unless you worked on them personally.
One Last notice and warning as to DVD format_ The Reviewing scenes command  interface controls are awkward at best; unlike the standard
small travailing bright circle in a track: which can be used with ease for precise review; unlike the uses of review on their DVD is like sculpting with a fork.  The DVD is not inexpensive_ so why strap this rock in the system? maybe the guy's in charge focus for the production have that information.
P.S._ In my option the purchase of a Gnomon DVD will more user friendly; the newer ones within five years.

8646246,5,B00IY0TOTQ,Excellent DVD for anyone serious about really learning the nitty gritty of creature design with Zbrush. I thoroughly enjoyed this presentation by Josh Herman and found it incredibly helpful and enlightening. Would be nice if the price was less but you get almost 6 hours of training  and you would pay quite a bit more to learn the same amount of information at an art school.,1434067200,,376,4.696969696969697
