2889897,5,B000SSQ7J2,"I do not like the little kid Seven, However much like the other seasons this one is pure gold. I don't care for the opinions of people who say the later seasons aren't great just because they're different than earlier episodes. Thats actually what makes it better, there isn't too much stale repetition. This season is gold, like the episodes Frat chance, tra something spells tramp,Al on the rocks, and Christmas. So enjoy gut-wrenching laughter with the bundys again and again, and don't listen to idiots who bad mouth the show. Let Al the King Bundy live on forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1188604800,4,593,5.0
2889898,5,B000SSQ7J2,"You've gotta admit, that kid Seven ruined a perfect show. Luckily, he didn't last. I still give this season 5 stars, simply because the rest of the cast were very funny. Looking forward to season 8, (no Seven!!) < that lil' turd!",1188172800,7,229,4.476190476190476
2889899,5,B000SSQ7J2,"Ok, ok, I know, Seven sucks. Gotcha. No argument there. But, I can ignore the scenes with him, read a magazine or something, until the king, the hero, the shoe man comes in to save us from the misery of Seven. Al Bundy is the funniest, greatest character I have ever seen, and even the weakest season of Married With Children still beats the heck out of the lame, tame, canned-laughter, seen-it-before tripe that networks spew out now, hoping we won't remember recycled jokes from the 70's and 80's.
Kelly and Bud are getting older now, and can have more adult situations now that they're out of high school. That only adds to the humor. Besides, Seven is only in a few episodes, not every one. Less than half. Strangely enough, The first disk has Seven the most, and it has the weakest episodes. Once Seven disappears, disks 2 and 3 have some hilarious episodes. So even though this DVD has crappy theme music, even though there are no extras at all, it still earns 5 stars from me. And, best of all, for season 8, no Seven, and.. the start of ""No Ma'am!""",1187654400,18,1056,4.448453608247423
2889900,4,B000SSQ7J2,"This is one of the few classic, long running sitcoms that never failed us as far as I am concerned (Simpsons, I'm looking in your general direction)

Yes, Seven was miserable. I think every fan agreed. Obviously the powers that be listened because they canned him.

This season is full of great classic moments. That pesky kid shows up and saps the energy from a few scenes but all in all it's not overwhelming. Season 8 forward is back to the consistent hi-jinks.

from season 7 - You gotta love Peggy's sensational creation ""Mr Empty Pants"" , Bud gets a little lovin' from the bride of his cousin,Kelly moves out, Al competes against Senior citzens and ACTUALLY WINS something, all in all plenty of great and entertaining moments.

Other than that - Kelly is still of questionable virtue, Bud can't get a date, Al hates his life, and Peggy wants sex.

One note- In my opinion, there is something worse than Seven in this season and it's the awful ""Rock of Ages "" episode where the Bundy's pretend to be rock stars in order to sneak into a first class lounge at the airport. Get out your book of History of Rock and Roll B Players to try to keep up with most of these has-beens and never beens who are highighted instead of sticking to the comedy. Reminiscent of the Sports Bar episode a few seasons back that had a lot of old sports heros that many of us younger viewers really didn't quite know. (except that one was at least funny)",1186012800,7,1435,4.44106463878327

2889938,5,B000SSQ7J2,"SPOILERS AHEAD

The seventh season premiere of the long-running Fox comedy ""Married...With Children"" is an underrated show in the overall series.  Called ""Magnificent Seven,"" it is often criticized for finally resorting to the infamous fallback option for sitcoms of casting a younger kid to compensate for an aging 'young' cast.  At least for the premiere, the creative staff is able to make it work, thanks to a versatile comedic script and excellent stunt casting.

The episode is really a showcase for Ed O'Neil, as his Al Bundy spearheads much of the plot momentum and even gets to be an odd hero.  Guest stars Bobcat Goldthwaite and Linda Blair stand out as Peg's derelict cousin Zeemus and his flashy wife.  Shane Sweet is Seven, their son.  While the character itself is a thin plot device, the story around him for this show has a moment of true poignancy.

The season inevitably drowns out the Seven character, as much better scripts are given to long-term cast members.  But, in the premiere, ""Magnificent Seven"" is very memorable.",1304640000,3,1042,4.942528735632184
2889939,5,B000SSQ7J2,"Not the best season of this show. This is by far my favorite show, but I didn't approve of the addition of 'seven' at all. He couldn't act and was frankly...a moron. They tried to spice the show up and they saw that it failed as quickly as we did. Next thing you know 'seven' goes missing and the show is back to normal.

If it is that bad, just force yourself to watch it cuz the show picks back up again in season 8. I believe season 8 is where no maam finally comes in. Very funny stuff lies ahead.",1289433600,,501,3.9603960396039604

2889942,1,B000SSQ7J2,"Married with Children - The Complete Seventh Season was a complete disaster. The writers brought in a confusing and unnecessary new character, a little boy named Seven. I couldn't believe how boring this new addition was, they quickly dropped the boy but the show was never the same. The writing had become really vile, childish, and just plain unfunny. This show was always a little raunchy and pushed the envelope but it became a joke and I lost interest halfway through the season.

Thankfully the annoying Seven was cut from the series and is some episodes he appears in scenes that are mercifully brief.

2889947,4,B000SSQ7J2,"This series was one that you either loved or deplored.  It was the 1st series that took a cynical look at home life in these United States and as such ran successfully for the nascent Fox network for some 12+ years.  The show could be very funny, before it got tired towards the end of its run.  The year being reviewed here has all the elements of the successful show:  smart-mouthed know-it-all son, school-popular daughter, neglected mom, and downtrodden working father.  If you liked the show, as did I, then buying the season here is a good value at these prices to watch when there's nothing else on.",1204329600,4,606,4.574074074074074
2889948,4,B000SSQ7J2,"This 1992-93 Season DVD of the Bundys and I recommend it to anyone who was a Married With Children viewer when it was on FOX along with the fact that I think the Seventh Season of Married With Children was one of the best seasons of the Bundy's as well as the season when the floozy airheaded Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) gets her first job as a waitress at the diner as well as the season when they temporarily added that annoying bratty kid(Seven) to the cast and crew of the show, due to Katey Sagals actual miscarriage in the Winter of 1992, which I didn't like along with the fact that they should've used the ""Love & Marriage"" song by Frank Sinatra during the introduction of each episode like it was originally shown on FOX, but I don't know why they haven't been doing that in the last few seasons of Married With Children DVD box sets.

Therefore since they couldn't go by their original idea to have Katey Sagal's real baby on the show that season since Katey's baby died in real life in the Spring of 1982, they had to improvise by having the Bundys cousin(Seven) move into the Bundy household in this season even though nobody really seemed to like Seven(Shane Sweet), but it became obvious that people were very unhappy & displeased with the addition of Seven on this show which resulted in Seven being abruptly dropped from the show in the Winter of 1993, but there was no explanation on Sevens departure from the show and the Bundys acted as if Seven never even existed, but I was so happy when Seven left.

I also enjoyed seeing musicians such as British singer Peter Noone from Hermans Hermit, Spencer Davis, Peter Frampton, etc. doing a cameo at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago with the Bundys in this season too when Al(Edward O'Neill)poses as a singer(Axel Bundy) to win a trip across country with the famous musicians & sings a song for ""Old Aid"" revising the lyrics from the the song ""We Are The World"" from the Spring of 1985.

But there's one thing I find hard to understand about this season since Kellys waitressing job was so-called her very first job, but Kelly had a previous job in the 6th Season working as a host at a TV Theme park where she also got to play the Verminator and had a job working as the Chicago TV station weather bunny in the 4th Season until she got ousted for lack of sufficient knowledge.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when the Bundy's were on Fox every Sunday night and when Bill Clinton got elected president back in November of 1992 while we were still having all those budgets cuts during the recession we had back in 1992-1993, due to George Bush, Sr's presidency which also takes me back to the days when I was living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) at the time when the Bundy's 7th Season was running on Fox.

Additionally, even though the Bundy's were stupid and Americas most dysfuntional family, at least this show helped us to appreciate not having the kind of problems the Bundys had and it helped us be more appreciative of our own families by being able to tell ourselves ""Thank God my family isn't like that"".

By the way I just got word that the Bundy's 11th Season is underway to be released on DVD on October 13th and I can hardly wait till then either.",1200268800,3,3304,4.470978441127695
2889949,5,B000SSQ7J2,"That little kid Seven has been infamous for being (quite possibly) the most annoying character in the entire ""Married with Children"" series. Well, at least that's what I personally think. Every time I see him in a scene, I just wish we could just focus on the Bundy's and the Darcy's only.

Well, anyway, with Seven aside, this yet another good season of MWC. Many comical highlights include Peggy daydreaming about pirates, Kelly buying her own motorcycle, Bud and his fraternity, etc, etc, etc. I don't really have to tell you that this is definitely one of the classic sitcoms of this generation, quite frankly because everyone else has said it. So buy it, along with the other MWC box sets.

He's hardly in any of the episodes and when he is he's there for only 1 or 2 jokes and then leaves.  Besides without Seven, it would be difficult to do the episode called ""Peggy and the Pirates,"" which I think is a classic.

2889957,5,B000SSQ7J2,"The seventh season DVD of the classic comedy series ""Married with Children"" is here and it follows up the success of the previous sets. The set is packaged in an attractive collectors box and contains all 26 episodes of the seventh season uncut. The show follows the misadventures of the Bundy family who are the picture of dysfunction. Family patriarch Al (Ed O'Neil) toils away in a low paying shoe store while his wife Peggy (Katey Sagal), loafs on the couch watching television and spending Al's money. Peggy will not work or do any household work such as cleaning, shopping, and cooking, which often forces Al to take extreme measure to get by.
  Added to the mix the dysfunctional Bundy children Bud (David Faustino) and Kelly (Christina Applegate), the annoying neighbors the D'arcy's, (Ted Mc Ginley and Amanda Bearse), and you get a recipe for laughs as everyday situations spiral out of control in true Bundy fashion.
  This season added a new character to the mix when Peggy's bumpkin relatives leave their young son Seven (Shane Sweet), behind during a visit, which forces Al to contend with one more person to provide for and the kids another sibling to contend with for attention.
  Highlights of the season include the episodes ""Peggy and the Pirates"", where the cast come to life as swashbucklers in a bizarre romance, novel, and misadventures ranging from Al becoming a topless bartender, to Bud starting college.
This season earned some mixed reviews from fans with the inclusion of the unpopular Seven character who was dropped from the show late in the season. That aside, there are some truly classic episodes in this set and even after years of Al's suffering, it rarely gets old watching him get in and out of one outrageous situation after another and the sharp banter he and the cast exchange.

  While the series was very controversial during its 11-season run, it produced many laughs and has earned a place in TV history. The bawdy and irreverent tone of the show changed the face of TV forever and always left you laughing week in and week out. While the episodes are the main draw of the set, the attractive menus and behind the scenes features such as Easter Eggs and cast interviews ensure that this volume is a must for fans and collectors alike

2889958,2,B000SSQ7J2,"The jokes just got cheesier and stupider.  One example: On ""UnAlful Entry"" in court the judge says to Al and the people of the court: ""I've got a date with a prostitute.""  What a totally stupid line!  That's just one example of the tiresome repeating of constant references to ""hooters"" and ""prostitutes"".  And, of course, everyone agrees that the kid, Seven, was a seriously dumb idea, and that was recognized and removed very quickly.  The only positive thing I can say about Season Seven is that Kelly Bundy continues to be so beautiful and wears really hot outfits.  Marcy doesn't really look very good with straight hair, but she never really did anything for me anyway.  She had a few sexy scenes in the earlier seasons, but I'm not seeing any positive chemistry between her and Jefferson.

In Season Six, I got tired of the ""Whoa baby"" family meetings when Katey Segal was actually pregnant.  Hit and miss piss poor writing contributed to that seasons diminishing appeal.  Once in a while, a good joke or comment will be made, but way too few and far between all the many not funny jokes.

To me, the beginning of the end of Married with Children was when we lost Steve Rhodes.  I don't care for Jefferson's role with Married..with Children, and even Marcy became a less interesting character on the show.  The show started to have more silly, cheesy one-liners, and there was less focus on a more long-term comical series of events that made the earlier shows so much more well-rounded, well-crafted, and more climatic when the real situation comedy started to fall into place.  The earlier shows were much more structured.  I miss that.  Just as soon as Jefferson came into the show, he became an unwelcomed guest (to me) and what his role did for the show.  Steve Rhoades character was great because he was more intelligent, and was more serious.  This offered funnier interaction with him and Al Bundy.  Jefferson plays more-or-less, a lazy dimwit, who thinks he's so wonderful, which only reduced the humor we enjoyed when ridiculing Al Bundy.  I'm kinda disappointed that I bought Season Six so I definitely don't want to buy Season Seven.

I'm renting it disc by disc right now, and with each episode I'm confirming to myself that I won't be wasting my money wanting to own it.  So I'm definitely done with buying Married with Children.",1191110400,9,2350,4.736453201970443

""Seven"" is to MARRIED WITH CHILDREN what ""Cousin Oliver"" was to THE BRADY BUNCH...except MWC lasted four more seasons, while TBB got cancelled!

Now, that being said, this season features guest stars Bill Maher, Bobcat Goldthwait, Brian Doyle-Murray, Charlene Tilton, Corey Feldman, Dan Castellaneta, David Garrison, Jamie Luner, John Sebastian, Linda Blair, Mark Lindsay, Melanie Chartoff, Peter Noone, Richie Havens, Robby Krieger, Spencer Davis and Vanna White. The ROCK OF AGES episode with the Sixties Rock stars ain't as bad as some may think...if you remember, Al always listened to the Oldies station in his Dodge and the storyline fits in with his love of that music.

And, for the guys, lotsa hot ladies with names like Muffy, Toni, Corky, Heidi, Mindy, Lulu, Mandy, Candy, Sandy, Tania and Dee Anna!

Even with weak storylines, this show always makes me laugh; and when I'm not laffing I find myself smiling throughout each episode! The Bundys act the way we wish we could, and get away with it to boot. So buy it, revel in it, forget the world's problems and just bask in the glow of ridiculousness that is MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.",1190505600,13,1424,4.949790794979079
2889960,3,B000SSQ7J2,"There is nothing like the love of your family in ""Married... with Children: The Complete Seventh Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the outrageously funny comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this hilarious seventh season, the Bundy family welcomes their five-year-old nephew Seven into their home after being abandoned by his own parents. Al gets a job as a topless bartender to help pay the bills. Peggy (Katey Sagal) makes a goofy cartoon of Al named Mr. Empty Pants that becomes a national sensation. Kelly (Christina Applegate) buys a motorcycle to feel youthful. Newly college student Bud (David Faustino) forms his own fraternity to impress girls. The sixth season of the popular FOX sitcom features plenty of over-the-top humor and such highlight episodes like ""Old College Try"", ""Heels on Wheels"", ""Peggy and the Pirates"", ""Go for the Old"" and ""The Proposition"". The introduction of character Seven to the series didn't fare well with viewers and the character was quickly dropped in the middle of the season.

If you are hoping to be blown away with the presentation of ""Married... with Children: The Complete Seventh Season"" then it's pretty obvious that you haven't purchase the previous ""Married... with Children"" DVD box sets. All 26 episodes of the seventh season are presented in their original full screen format. The 3-disc set contains a decent picture quality that is certainly better than your average television rebroadcast, and a clean 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. Like the previous box sets, there are no interesting special features in this release and only include bonus previews of other DVD releases from the studios. The DVD menus are rather plain. Overall, ""Married... with Children: The Complete Seventh Season"" earns a ""C"".",1190160000,4,1937,5.248387096774193
2889961,4,B000SSQ7J2,"I am subtracting 1 star because -as mentioned before- Seven absolutely sucks.

2889962,5,B000SSQ7J2,"Looks like I found some other true MWC fans!  I am looking forward to getting my Season 7 DVD set along with Seasons 8, 9, 10, and 11...  OK, we've established that Seven's character was not a great idea, but who cares...  There were too many laughs, even with him there.  However, the show when it was Seven's birthday is Classic MWC...  I love a good Bundy brawl.

The show evolved.  The characters changed.  Bud and Kelly got older.  This is all good.  If everything had stayed the same, they would not have been around for 11 Seasons!  We would have gotten bored and moved on...  We (the true fans) kept watching because the cast became more outrageous and gave us even more to laugh at.

Al's life continued to get more and more pathetic.  Kelly's brain continued getting smaller and smaller (cudos to her for playing that role so well)!  Bud tries harder and harder to get a date.  And Peggy... well Peggy does nothing... And she is really got at it!  MWC is a show to make you laugh.  If you try to analize it, you will not be able to enjoy it...",1189036800,8,1053,4.312820512820513
8206698,1,B000SSQ7J2,"Let's forget, for the moment, that Sony went all cheap and altered every episode so it is not the same as it aired on first run by replacing the opening and closing credits theme with generic junk.  They ruined the best episode of this season!  The Movie Show originally ended with a series of great gags over the closing credits.  But, because it originally ended with ""Oh, wait, here comes the Columbia logo!  BOO!"" and Sony replaced the Columbia logo on every episode with their stupid Sony TV logo, THEY TOOK OUT THESE JOKES!  Because they took out the Columbia logo, they took out all these great gags!  It's just a still promo image with that awful generic theme they replaced Love And Marriage with.

Bottom line: avoid ALL Married... With Children DVD sets.  Don't reward stinginess and stupidity.  To put it all into perspective: I was given this DVD set as a gift, as I wouldn't have PAID for it.  I ended up giving it back!  That's how worthless and pathetically Sony treated these episodes.",1524960000,,1002,4.636363636363637

8206700,3,B000SSQ7J2,"Married With Children had been getting better.  But this season took a step back with the addition of Seven.  There was just something too annoying about him.  And he was written out pretty quickly, The  first show Magnificent Seven when his parents dumped at the Bundy's were the highlight with him. But all in all the show was still good  T R A Something Something Spells Tramp.  Frat Chance Kelly Doesn't Live Here Anymore and especially Rock Of Ages were highlights of disc one.
 Wedding Show, Heels On Wheels, Mr  Empty Pants, Peggy And The Pirates are highlights of disc two  And You Cant Miss is one of my favorite episodes.  As Bud goes on a Dating Game type show,  With Chantel Dubay who was my favorite Price Is Right model.  And this is the only thing except for the Price Is Right that I have ever seen her in.
The season was kind of running out of steam with the third disc.  But Unalful Entry, and Movie Show are highlights also.",1506729600,,943,4.412790697674419
