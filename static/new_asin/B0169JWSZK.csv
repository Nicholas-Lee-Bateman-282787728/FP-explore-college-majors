8736006,5,B0169JWSZK,I bought this since Ray Underwood was one of the participants & he will be at a weekend seminar of our freestyle club.  Really enjoyed!,1474934400,,135,4.4
8736007,5,B0169JWSZK,"This video is tear jerker.  What a great compilation of how these guys followed a group of dog trainers for several years.  The star of the movie is a border collie named ""Pepsi"".  I googled Gail and Pepsi and found dozens of videos of them on Youtube.  Pepsi died on the day this movie was released.  But through this video, he will live on forever!  What a great dog!",1465344000,,369,4.27536231884058
8736008,5,B0169JWSZK,Loved it.  I think anyone that likes dogs would enjoy this and be able to relate to the strong bond has been created between these dogs and owners.,1458604800,,147,4.25
8736009,5,B0169JWSZK,"This is an absolute must-see for anyone involved in the sport of canine musical freestyle, but any dog lover would enjoy it, especially those who recognize the incredible bond that develops between an owner and the dog that he or she trains in any sport, work or hobby.  I imagine that anyone with an interest in indoor kite-flying would adore the film too, along with those who have gone through the trials and tribulations of putting on a  theatrical production with dedicated but capricious amateurs.  I was hoping the entire play might be on the video -- the bits and pieces that we see of it are SO intriguing, and I wanted to see the whole story.  But it's so much fun and so inspiring -- and in places a little bit sad -- just as it is.  Highly recommended for dog lovers and their dogs!",1453766400,,794,4.410958904109589
8736010,4,B0169JWSZK,"I have done some dancing with my Sheltie.  I really enjoyed this movie and pick up some new moves.  The characters (not actors) are all very interesting, as is the premise of the large production that these people spent many hours perfecting.  It was a little tedious in places, as I am sure it was for those involved.",1453680000,,318,4.448275862068965
8736011,3,B0169JWSZK,"Unleashed! A Dog Dancing Story is a documentary about an amateur dog dancing troupe and an aspiring theatre director as they attempt to mount the first-ever dog dancing and indoor kite flying theatrical performance. The film captures the challenges they face in their personal lives as well as on the stage. A real-life version of the Mickey and Judy Lets put on a show! movies, the film chronicles the difficulties of producing an amateur theatrical performance and reveals the powerful bond between handler and dog. The group spends over two years realizing the first-time directors vision, writing scripts, building sets, raising funds, and rehearsing exhaustively. As tension mounts and obstacles pile up, the trainers, all women, and their dogs persevere and the director finds his patience wearing thin.

This unusual documentary focuses on a world unfamiliar to the general public. Though at first it might seem as if these people are deluded eccentrics with show biz aspirations, we see their enthusiasm, total dedication, and unswerving drive to get their act up to professional standard, backed by hard work, long hours, and constant adaptation. With a niche act and limited venues, the trainers know they must create an exceptional show. The director is both the means to their goal and, at times, an impediment as ideas clash and artistic differences strain relationships. In its brief 81 minutes, the movie provides the backgrounds of the trainers and their director. The dogs, of course, are born scene stealers and adorable, so dog lovers would probably enjoy watching them exercise their considerable talents.

There are no special features on this bare-bones widescreen DVD release.",1450224000,2,1699,5.288888888888889
