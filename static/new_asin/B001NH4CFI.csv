8327030,5,B001NH4CFI,"I thought this was an excellent documentary on forgiveness and ordered it for our library.  It explores the stories of several people who have confronted terrible losses caused by the actions of others, and the different ways they decided to approach forgiveness--or to not forgive!  They share openly what the experience is like for them, and the emotional challenges they have gone through as a result.  I highly recommend it.",1311552000,5,428,5.085714285714285
