3997117,5,B002VKE1K2,"The premise is simple: a pleasant, good-natured woman has been haunted by a supernatural being for most of her life. Her boyfriend, who is the type of guy who thinks he can contend with an otherworldly entity simply because he's hyped up on testosterone, wants to get the creepy details on tape. So he buys an expensive camera, sets up a tripod in their bedroom, and endlessly records their nocturnal activities in hopes of illuminating exactly what is happening to his girlfriend. Unfortunately, this very conceit seems to upset the malevolent trickster stalking her, and results in an escalation of the being's involvement. At one point, the boyfriend yells, ""Is that all you got?"" and consequently, the demon more than rises to the challenge.
  The genius of ""Paranormal Activity"" (besides it's reported $11,000 budget), is that it leaves much to the imagination. Like ""Blair Witch Project"", it never shows exactly what is obsessed with the woman, and for people with fertile imaginations, the unknown becomes frightening. ""Paranormal"" removes the shaky camera work that many found distracting in ""Blair Witch"", but the grainy, black/white photography is chilling and gives the film an aura of authenticity. The luminous glow creating a surreal halo around the master bedroom is akin to the strobelight flashing through the darkness in the eerie Maryland woods of ""Blair Witch"". And like ""Blair"", the majority of the action takes place in the dead of night, making one dread the arrival of dusk. I actually felt a tingly prickling at the back of my neck when the automated timer clicked to 2:00 a.m. and the ominous rumble-buzz appeared, signaling the arrival of the mischievous demon.
  Part of what is so scary about ""Paranormal"" is that it seems like it could really happen. Gore is kept to a minimum, and the excruciating pauses play like reality. Details are intriguing and well-developed. The boyfriend keeps taunting the demon, trying to up the ante, and the demon seeks payback. Both characters are sympathetic, and the director keeps ratcheting up the tension as the two get more and more stressed, to the point of anger and hysteria. She wants the horrifying events to end; he simply wants to be in control and get them on tape. Purchasing a ouja board might be the last straw, inviting the demon in so it can wreak havoc on their lives. One wonders if the boyfriend had been less obnoxious, maybe the demon wouldn't have felt a need to invade their home in such relentless, aggressive fashion.
  The actors/actresses are excellent. The boyfriend is cocky and feels like he needs to challenge the demon to show his loyalty. His girlfriend acts reasonably despite being battered with fear. I loved the part when the ghost expert steps into the house and immediately retreats, sensing that the entity is bristling and doesn't want him in the house. Unlike the priest in ""The Exorcist"", this man is intimidated and feels his presence will only enrage the demon.
  The true emotional impact of ""Paranormal Activity"" would be seeing it alone, in a gloomy room, in total silence. The showing I attended was packed, and many audience members ruined the spooky tone by yelling inane comments at the screen. ""Oh, HELL NO!"" and ""GET THE *BLEEP* OUTTA THAT PLACE!"" were common helpful suggestions shouted by aspiring comedians. Despite this commentary, the movie still raised my hackles and kept my eyes glued to the screen, searching for inspired details that added heft to the story. If creative indie script writers can continue molding brilliant thrillers out of virtually nothing, the future of modern horror films looks promising.",1255392000,5,3638,5.01158940397351

3997119,5,B002VKE1K2,"This movie is very scary. Althought it is only absolutly terrifing for only about 1 min total, but the rest of the movie is funny and suspensful.",1255219200,,145,4.407407407407407
3997120,5,B002VKE1K2,"There's no studio logo when the film begins, and there are no opening credits. There's only a title card thanking the families of Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston for their cooperation. We then go back to the fall of 2006 and see home video footage of Micah prepping the camera just as Katie pulls into the driveway of their San Diego home. Strange things have been going on in the house as they sleep, and they want to capture it on film. A psychic is invited over, and only then do we learn that strange things have been happening to Featherston pretty much her entire life. Is she being followed by some supernatural force? If so, what does it want with her? The psychic makes it clear that his area of expertise is ghosts, which won't do much good for Featherston since it seems she has more of a demon problem.

This is the basic scenario of ""Paranormal Activity,"" the most inventive and frightening horror movie of recent memory. Presenting itself as a documentary consisting of raw footage, it works not as a gory, over the top camp fest but as a slow, disturbing unfolding of events. It utilizes unnerving subtleties like phantom scratching noises, mysterious thuds, unexplained shadows, and lights that turn on and off completely on their own. The more overt visual scares come with no explanations for how or why they occur. It's not about what you see, but about what you don't see. Made on a budget of just $15,000, shot in just seven days in a real house without a crew, and released almost entirely through word-of-mouth and internet campaigns, ""Paranormal Activity"" may someday be regarded as one of the scariest movies ever made.

Most of the terror is reserved for long, mostly uninterrupted shots of the couple sleeping in their bedroom. At first, we only hear strange noises that don't seem to be coming from anywhere. As the film progresses, stranger, more intense things happen. The door forcefully slams shut, after which we hear loud knocking. Footsteps trail through the bedroom. The bed sheets lift and lower completely on their own. At one point, Featherston awakens, gets out of bed, and just stands there staring at Sloat for the next couple of hours (shown in high speed). When noises wake both of them up, they search the upstairs hallways and discover that the overhead passage to the attic has been opened. What do you think Sloat will find when he goes up to investigate?

Wikipedia defines home as ""a place of residence or refuge and comfort."" Unlike films such as ""The Blair Witch Project,"" in which the terror is distantly located in the middle of the woods, ""Paranormal Activity"" takes place in a familiar environment where one is supposed to feel safe and secure from the outside world. The greatest terror is in knowing that your place of residence or refuge and comfort is in fact no such place; rather, it's a place a fear. So many primal fears are exploited in this film--fear of the dark, fear of the unknown, fear of helplessness and isolation, fear of exposure--and yet they're never reduced to the level of cheap thrills. Sitting in the theater, I can't guarantee that you will watch in helpless fascination, as you may keep covering your eyes in anticipation of something dreadful happening. What I can guarantee is that you will be genuinely afraid.

That being said, this movie probably wouldn't have worked were it not for Sloat and Featherston (the actors, not the characters they play). Together, they make a convincing young couple. Even more convincing, however, is the way they react separately to the escalating supernatural events. Sloat initially doesn't take anything that happens too seriously, although he does seem enthusiastic about having a camera in the house. Only later, when things go from bad to worse, does he find himself in a power struggle with the entity stalking his girlfriend. There are times when he tries to be the dominant and protective male, claiming that he has the wherewithal to save his girlfriend; in truth, he has never had any control of the situation. Featherton is physically and psychologically more vulnerable, well aware that her past is catching up with her, frustrated at the willfulness and skepticism of her boyfriend. Their believability is a credit to first-time director Oren Peli, who opted not to have them recite scripted lines of dialogue.

The film ends exactly the same way it began: Without any credits. The only thing we get is yet another title card, and this time, I won't reveal what it says. I will say that the shot leading up the title card is the most chilling one I've seen since the slow, agonizing close up of Justin Long's head at the end of ""Jeepers Creepers."" I have a feeling that the success of ""Paranormal Activity"" will continue to mount, relying not on studio enforced tactics but on audience reaction, the most authentic promotion there is for a movie. Just as it should be--this is an astonishing achievement, not merely as a story, but as an exercise in pacing, atmosphere, and apprehension. A word of warning: It earns the right to be called a horror movie, so if you don't like being scared, you should definitely stay away.",1255046400,9,5157,4.789887640449439
3997121,4,B002VKE1K2,"Remember a few years ago when ""The Blair Witch Project"" overcame genre expectations and became a blockbuster cult hit? That film had several other films that were inspired by its ""Mockumentary"" style gimmick; ""Cloverfield"", ""[REC]"" and ""Quarantine"" to name a few. Well, writer/director Oren Peli's ""PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"" is another film that follows in the footsteps of those films. It premiered in the 2007 Screamfest Festival and at the Slamdance film festival in 2008. Truth be told, I am not a fan of the POV style cinematography but I do believe that anything done with the right execution, right premise and a film like this will work. The Spanish film ""[REC]"" had definitely pulled this off and I am happy to report that ""Paranormal Activity"" also succeeds in achieving tension, suspense and genuine creepiness.

The film centers on a couple named Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat respectively) who lives in a large suburban house. The couple is experiencing several unexplained experiences that leads them to shooting themselves with a camera on a tripod while they sleep. Everyday they would review the footage on the camera until they both become convinced that there is something evil going on their home. Not a ghost, but something demonic that wants Katie...

The best way to approach ""Paranormal Activity"" is with the viewers' expectations lowered. The film is a slow-burning experience since the film appears to be assembled footage collected from a DV camera. As such the film's quality is very low budget when we talk about cinematography but its low-budget quality doesn't exactly work against it since it adds to the film's amateurish atmosphere and style. In the beginning of the film, I almost felt like I was watching an episode of ""A Haunting""; the film follows very familiar ground on documented haunting and possessions. This makes the film a little predictable but director Oren Peli manages to draw his audience into the experience. You see the couple whine, argue and become scared out of their wits as we witness their frightening experiences through the lens of a handheld camera. Blankets are moved, sleepwalking is witnessed through the lens of the handheld camera as the events slowly escalate and become worst. I was pleased to report that the POV style was executed fairly well, it was rough, edgy and never for one minute did it feel polished as a real movie would feel. If Oren Peli's intentions were to generate tension through the emulation of a `reality' then he does succeed in terms of cinematography and his ability to create subtle gaps in the screenplay. It does succeed in its art but it does have its weaknesses. (I will discuss this further)

The film does follow the usual signs of haunting and/or leading to possession. ""Infestation""- where an entity wanders around a familiar space while it gains strength. ""Oppression""- when the haunted and their companions experience uneasiness by certain frightening incidents; until it leads to eventual `possession`. I am not making this up, (you may research it yourself) a demonic force gets its strength from fear and negative energy. If you look at the events in steps, they feed off one another. The screenplay does follow these established rules as we see Micah and Katie experience the signs one by one; they hear noise, loud banging, footsteps until the paranormal activities escalate to the events happening more often to the point of seeing shadowy figures and actual contact. Most of the actual haunting happen at 3 am (as a way to mock the hour of Christ's death) until it becomes worst and worst. It is quite an uneasy experience to see one dragged on the floor in a very inhuman fashion, the direction does bring the film into overdrive the longer it went on.

The film follows the usual opposing beliefs mechanism in horror movies in its two protagonists. Katie is the one being haunted and the sympathetic one while Micah is the skeptical one. Katie just wants the unexplained phenomena to stop; she knows that she is the reason for the haunting and she is desperate to seek any help. Micah is the cocky boyfriend; with no spiritual beliefs and he insists that the situation is under his control. Horror movies are full of characters like Micah and Oren Peli accomplishes this with this annoying character. The two mess around with Quija boards, mediums, research and experts in demonology, attic exploration, while they search for a solution to this haunting. The film does give answers to the events experienced by Micah and Katie; I thought it was a decent exercise although the answers weren't necessarily new to me.

Granted, that ""Paranormal Activity"" gets its strength as a sensory experience rather than a dramatic one. For a film like this to succeed, the movie has to appear rough and unpolished; to be accompanied with acting that is just so realistic that the audience can feel invested in the movie despite its low characterization. Well, in this the movie falters a bit; as the acting by Featherston and Sloat are a bit uneven. The amateurish acting somewhat damages any feelings of realism attained by the director. Their performances do appear a little too contrived, and it was so obvious that they were trying very hard to generate their sensations. Much of the film's burden falls on Featherston's performance; and while certain scenes were acceptable and good, some lacked the feeling of genuine emotions. Sloat was also very wooden in his portrayal as Katie's boyfriend, he becomes annoying. The entire cinematic experiences of ""Paranormal Activity"" hinges on spending time with the couple to get the viewer invested; their disappointing portrayal of realistic terror hampered the film a little.

Thankfully, the bleak atmosphere of the film makes up for the weaknesses of its two leads. The barren, home-video look of the movie assists in encouraging the viewer to buy into the film's main premise.  I enjoyed the sleeping footages and the jolts, it did manage to make some strands of hair on the back of my neck to stand up; although it wasn't really non-stop scares. Of course, the film does get more intense as it went on but I have to say that film may have benefited if it was a tad shorter; this way the direction would made the film a lot tighter and taut.

Paramount did market this movie extremely well; playing only at midnight in a limited number of theaters to get the hype going. However, for a film like this to really reach its viewer, the expectations has to be really low. Given with a very small budget of $ 11,000, the filmmakers managed to make use of its interesting premise. An unknown, unseen force after a woman in the safety of her own home promotes incredible helplessness; seen through the lens of a handheld camera, it successfully generates a psychological grip on its audience. The film does have some well-timed scares and scenes were shot in a very simplistic manner that made me very pleased. ""Paranormal Activity"" may have its share of flaws but it is a refreshing break from the rehearsed visual effects that has made Hollywood horror films ineffective; the film is a good ""haunted house"" full-length feature film.

The performances of the stars here were solid enough to make me care for them and their actions throughout the movie were realistic and grounded completely off the mold for movies of this genre which effectively sold the idea of ""this could be any of us in our homes"" that much better and gave a lot of realism and a breath of fresh air to the horror genre that wasn't having the best of times.",1516320000,,705,4.30827067669173

3997227,4,B002VKE1K2,"Kate and Micah move into a San Diego house. Before the film started, Kate has been followed by paranormal activity off and on her entire life. Micah is obsessed with catching this phenomenon on film and wants to find out what it wants. They call a psychic in who warns them that it's a demon that feeds off of negative energy and will only get worse if they try to communicate with it. He recommends they contact his demonologist friend for help, but they don't listen. The activity filmed gets more pronounced over time until Kate is walking around and saying things she doesn't remember. Can they be saved from this malevolent presence?

Paranormal Activity is the film that reignited the found footage genre. It has such a simple premise and was made inexpensively, but has long standing effects. The film is entirely from the point of view of Micah's cameras, which he obsessively carries around and sets up to film their room at night. Fairly mundane things happen during the day while most of the supernatural stuff happens at night. The cameras capture the activity that starts small like opening and closing doors, random noises, and lights flickering on and off. All minor things that happen maybe once a twice a night. Then bigger things start happening like Kate sleepwalking or speaking without remembering or being dragged out of bed. The night where the powder is sprinkled on the floor to see footsteps is also especially creepy. The film has no background music, which makes it easy to hear every little noise. Suspense increases with each night sequence in a minimalist way.

The characters are pretty realistic. Micah is obsessed with capturing and communicating with the entity. He's annoying and a bit of a jerk because he puts his own curiosity over Kate's fear and their wellbeing. One day he brings in a Ouija board when he was explicitly told not to and provokes the entity. He annoys everyone by taking his camera absolutely everywhere. He never takes anyone else's feelings into account. Kate is scared of the entity and just wants it to go away. She thinks the cameras will antagonize whatever it is and grows more and more annoyed over Micah's excitement. I liked Kate a lot more than Micah. She's more reasonable and even keeled. She doesn't feel sorry for herself because of her troubled chilhood or the paranormal events around her.

Paranormal Activity is a great example of creating horror and suspense through small moments over time. Like the Blair Witch Project before it, this film provided effective scares on a small budget and changed the face of found footage. The only lacking part, besides horrible Micah, is the ending. Much of it takes place out of view and the last jumpscare, which is so common now, is cheap. The suspense built to a lackluster ending scene. The film is unique, so I would watch the rest of the series and I hope to see improvement.",1490054400,,2896,4.7764471057884235

I can really appreciate what they were going for and why some people did find it terrifying. It's not about the jump scares, it's about the atmosphere. It's not about scaring you in the moment, but later when you're home alone in the dark and you hear a door creak... and you have that little moment of panic.

Paranormal Activity is one of those movies that you'll either love or hate. The movie was a cult phenomenon and terrified audiences back in 2009. As for reviewers, like myself, and critics alike, the opinions towards this movie is very divided. Because it's a found footage movie, mixed reactions will definitely be the end result. Paranormal Activity, for me anyway, I thought it was good. On one hand, the movie is well-made, I like how there is no background music and that it's all very quiet. To me, that gave me a very relentless and realistic feel and some of the scares and the atmosphere are effective because if it. The movie does have some irritating jump scares but not a lot to make me annoyed. The big flaw the movie suffers from that did bug me about the movie is that the characters are not that well developed and as a result, I don't really feel anything for the characters.

This whole movie was seen through the same camera,  either the husband holding it or it sitting on their bedroom dresser.  Strange things have been happening in the house and the husband wants to get to the bottom of it.  As the movie goes on,  they catch different things on camera as they sleep.  It is pretty well done and really kept me tuned in and a little jittery to be honest.  I guess that is the mark of a good scary movie.

3997425,4,B002VKE1K2,"Okay, I've finally seen it. The movie so many have called the best horror movie of 2009. Hell, a few have labeled it the best horror movie of the decade. The praise and publicity this movie received is as insane as any I've seen for a movie. I have to admit though, this was a darned good movie. You know when some people describe a film as ""pulse pounding""? Well, that's literally how I could describe Paranormal Activity because there were a couple of moments where my pulse actually quickened--I don't react like that often for a movie.
I think it was on The Vault of Horror a while back that I read an apt line on this movie: This is the movie The Blair Witch Project was meant to be.

I liked Blair Witch when it first came out. It's appeal has lessened greatly in the decade-plus since it came out, though. The thing about that movie was it was all a long setup with a couple scares and a gripping ending. Paranormal Activity took better strides at getting into the suspense faster, building it steadier through the whole story, and hammering the audience at the very end.

Katie and Micah have been living together in a house for a while, but they've been noticing some strange phenomena at night like footsteps and faucets and lights seemingly turning themselves on and off. Micah gets the bright idea to videotape it as a way to collect evidence--and some notoriety online. Katie seeks out a psychic of sorts, who tells her that he deals with ghosts and it looks like she's got a demon. And there's the little twist of this from the beginning, because it's not a ghost or spirit haunting the house, but a demon or some other malevolent entity haunting Katie.

The majority of the film is shown through Micah's eyes in a sense, as he carries the camera around most of the time or sets it up on a tripod. And Micah is a douche. He's dismissive, arrogant, and condescending through a lot of the film, even after he has realized that he's recording a genuine supernatural event. As a matter of fact, it's Micah's treatment of Katie that drives the tension in this movie as much or more than the demon terrorizing his girlfriend. It didn't take very long for me to start rooting for his demise, much in the same way I rooted for the demise of the camera operator in Cloverfield (a far more irritating character).

The great thing about this movie doesn't come from the acting, as the home movie approach felt artificial to me a lot of the time. And the moments of terror become a bit repetitive, at least in the sense that disembodied foot steps wear a little thin. The great thing is that this horror movie brings the experience down to a very personal level that's easy to relate to. I'm not a fan of the ""home movie"" approach to film making because it's so often poorly executed, but it's used to great effect here. The effects aren't grandiose or designed to gross out the audience, but used in a rather subtle fashion to accentuate the tone of the story. One understated use of sound I particularly liked, involving a change in Katie's voice in a scene--like me, you may need to rewind the movie a few seconds to be sure you heard it.

Go see this movie if you haven't already. It's worth watching, even if you're not a fan of horror. Be warned that there is talk a sequel is already in the works to be released this coming Halloween to go against Saw VII. I'm nervous about that because there is a strong chance of a sequel falling flat on its face. The initial shock and awe of the first film is spent and it won't be possible to catch lightening in a bottle a second time. Remember how Hollywood thought Blair Witch 2 was a good idea?",1421193600,,3646,4.419642857142857

3997428,5,B002VKE1K2,"Oh fun!  Oh I was one of those who voted for it to be screened in my city in South Texas. I went online, I got sucked into the hype and why not, it's fun and it was new and yes it's been done to death but so has The Fast and the Furious and dudes still get all puckered up about that so why can't fans of Paranomal Activity do the same? Is it accurate? I don't know, I've never had a demon follow me, at least not knowingly. How can anyone really rip apart a supernatural movie? It's really something that can't be proven so it's open to speculation and viewer interpretation and that's what made these films so successful.

The acting is superb for two uknowns. The director made a solid decision on choosing actors. Katie breaks the typical body mold and that's is great! She has a beautiful body and her charm and playful candor is what makes the sinister side of her all the more shocking. In all, for a movie that was shot in 7 days and on a what was it, 7K budget I think, geez, look at my review of As Above so Below, another found footage that kinda sucked on a huge budget.

Say what you want about Paranormal Activity and it's sequels but I think they're scary, they're fun and the mythos is really interesting. I'm looking forward to the new one in 3D and it's supposed to explain the time travel aspects and I'm looking forward to it. I haven't let the digital age spoil my fun. Movies still impress me, however great or small the effects. And if you're home alone with the lights off this movie will scare you. It's the kind of movie that will creep up on you when you're asleep and wake up for a glass of water and realize that you should have just remained asleep. I'll pay for that, over and over.

It escalates.
The ending is good.
It's genuinely scary. This film scared Stephen Spielberg.

Just pure slow-building anxiety and suspense. For a low-budget film, every aspect of the movie is top notch, including the actors. These aren't Oscar-winning performances, yet the actors portray their parts so seamlessly that the faux realism is tantalizingly believable. Using the actors' real names as the character's names is another simple yet elegant twist to the chill of the film.

While it's true the film isn't chock full of ""jump"" scares, its brand of scary is subtler, more psychological. Dare I even say Hitchcockian? We are along for the journey as these characters come to realize the danger they are in. The ""horror"" aspect of the film is not blatant, yet it's more sinister for its subtlety, and more realistic.

They did a much better job on this one that all of the consecutive films, as those were just amped up copycats, but this one at least gave me a few chills.
The ending was a little... dorky, in my opinion. But it was fun all the same.

supposdly filmed as a documentary, it couldn't have looked less like one.  i was so bored, i played pokmon Y through just about the whole thing.  i can attest that it is scarier than this movie.

seriously, what is so frightening about some ""low humming"" or ""footsteps"" or a shadow you can barely see on the bedroom door or the girl standing for 2 hours FFed so WE wouldn't have to stand for 2 hours?  nuthin', that's what.

thankfully, the girl never gave in to the idiot boyfriend's numerous attempts to film them phuqing, although this may have brought some real terror to the move.

i kept saying, out loud, to the tv, ""kill him"" and ""when is the demon going to kill him?"".  then, we're gypped by not even getting to see him die.  i love psychological horror.  this is not even that.  nothing implied made me worry about what was going to happen.

the only realistic part was the girl's reaction to the boyfriend's numerous attempts to film them phuqing, which progressively got more and more disgusted, and her reactions to his meddling which, had this been real, would've been the whole reason the demon was messing with them.

Then, in the final reel, it suddenly becomes truly creepy, and the ending, although somewhat obvious, will bring you out in goosebumps.

3997517,5,B002VKE1K2,"My upbringing led me to fear demons above all else. While I no longer buy into the fear based dogma of my childhood, I find myself drawn to movies with themes of demons, ghosts, or other supernatural phenomena.  I detest contrite characters/scripts in movies, as well as found-footage films that nauseate me when the credits roll (i.e., Blair Witch).

With all that in mind, I found Paranormal Activity fell right up my alley. This is the kind of film that stayed on my mind after watching, and the genuineness of the characters (there really are only two characters for most of this movie) plus the build-in of creep factor and imagining the possibilities of this happening in my bedroom, along with the lack of cheesy chase/scream scenes made this movie for me.  Sound was key.  If you watch this at a regular or lower volume, you will not have as good an experience.  This movie is best watched in the dark, with headphones, so you can get the full effect...it's almost like you're there in the room with Katie and Micah.  Sounds are what made this movie particularly fear-inducing for me.

I also think that seen in the context of Paranormal 2 and then 3 (I didn't love 4 as much), the whole package ties it together in ways that answer questions which might nag at the viewer. However, I still think the film stands on its own without the others to make it complete.

Finally, because this movie was made of ""found-footage,"" (though again not the shaky, dizzying kind) it made it seem much more real and the possibility that this could happen in my bedroom made it all the more frightening.

If you're into fast moving plots and need a continuous jolt of scare throughout a film, this might not be your thing.  I have known people who either love it or hate it, so I hope the above helps you determine which side of the fence you might be on.",1379203200,,1847,4.51951951951952
3997518,1,B002VKE1K2,"Yesterday I purchased this DVD from my local store since I love horror films where atmosphere, psychological and suspense filled terror can put fear into me. Also, using my imagination creates better fear and terror than all the gore in most modern horror movies can fill. Therefore, I was very disappointed that ""Paranormal Activity"" was such a big yawn that when the finale actually came I didn't even jump out of my skin.

  As for what this film is about others have already written but what I finally realized that didn't work for me is that this is like the TV program, ""Paranormal State"", put onto film. For those not aware, ""Paranormal State"" is about a  bunch of Penn State students who investigate paranormal activity in various places. So, in ""Paranormal Activity"" not only do we have two truly green morons trying to solve what this haunting is about but they don't bother to know why and how it all started. They don't have proper tools to conduct paranormal research just the video camera trying to capture paranormal happenings. Big deal! The documentary style video journal really loses all the mystery and atmosphere trying so hard to be scary.

I am a connoisseur of horror movies, and I am absolutely puzzled how people could say this is the scariest movie they've ever seen.  While I think the basic premise of the ""use your imagination"" and ""home video"" gimmicks are fun and creative, that is where the comparisons to The Blair Witch Project end.  This movie as a whole bored the heck outta me.  So much time is spent on the uneventful lives of this couple- fiddling with the camera, talking about their days, doing homework, talking about what is going on in their house, sprinkling baby powder on the floor - but the worst parts are when we as the audience are burdened with terrible acting and seeing the couple watching the videos of the previous night, clips we have already seen.  Was it really necessary to subject us to view the same video bits twice?  As an audience, there is nothing more offensive than wasting our time watching a bunch of nothing and repeated clips.  They may as well have just taken the decent 15 minutes of the film and looped it to fill 90 minutes of screentime!  Also, I can usually look past tiny inconsistencies in movies, but I struggled to look past the ones in this film - such as how could a young college couple afford such a luxurious house and video camera BUT not be able to replace their old box TVs with new flatscreens?  I know that may seem like such a minor thing to most people, but combined with everything else, it just contributed to making this movie difficult to watch or be scared by it -- I get more scared watching Back To The Future.  I even tried to give the series a second chance by watching Part 2 - now there's a total of 177 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.  There is a good reason why the price for this DVD is now only $4-- Do not waste your time!",1365552000,8,2055,4.225063938618926

3997549,5,B002VKE1K2,"As probably almost everybody knows, this is a ""found footage"" film, about two young people who decide to document on tape their life in a supposedly haunted house. And I must say that I liked it a lot.

This film was made on a microscopic budget of 15.000 (yes, fifteen thousand) USD. Everything occurs inside just one house and its garden. There are only three actors, all totally unknown to me (and the third one appears only briefly). The soundtrack is for all practical purposes absent - and that actually is a good thing, as the mixture of silence and some white noise is in itself pretty creepy. Lights are mostly toned down (and a good thing too!) and the decorations are just those of a regular house. And yet, it ultimately made 300 million USD worldwide - and frankly, once you see it, you will understand why.

I am absolutely not saying anything about the plot, on purpose. Just be prepared to a long, very long and slow, very slow beginning - for those who do not like this kind of things, it is better to abstain from watching ""Paranormal Activity"". This beginning is however necessary, because the whole idea behind this movie was a long and slow escalation, a little like in Ravel's ""Bolero"". Another image I had in mind when watching ""Paranormal Activity"" was that of a lion slowly stalking its prey - it walks all the time very slowly but once it has got near enough, every next small step greatly diminishes prey's chances to survive - until the inevitable final leap, very brief but absolutely deadly...

Depending on your mood and on your personal taste, this is a film as easy to love as it is to hate. I personally loved it and my wife liked it too - albeit towards the end she tended to cover her face more and more with the blanket, until only one (wide open) eye was left to make peek-a-BOO...))) May be the best thing is just to watch it and make your own mind. Enjoy!",1363910400,,1895,4.455331412103747

Now an adult and living with her boyfriend the strange happenings have started up again. As a way to prove or disprove what is happening, her doubting boyfriend buys an expensive camera to set up and record their bedroom at night. The conceit of the movie is that all the footage you see is from their camera. It not only films while they are sleeping, the boyfriend carries it along during the day catching conversations, arguments and a visit from a psychic who tries to help. The phenomena escalates with the boyfriend deliberately provoking whatever is following his girlfriend because he does not believe in it.

I enjoyed the way the movie was made as ""found footage"" from the camera the couple used but they didn't do enough with it to make this a truly scary horror film. When you're showing two people sleeping you have a perfect set up to scare the audience with something suddenly happening but not much does for the first half of the movie. I understand they wanted the story to build to a climax but I was bored. The second half has a few creepy scenes although they telegraphed the ending so when it happened I wasn't surprised.

I've got a pretty ridiculous home theater with Martin Logans and Denon and Oppo blah, blah, blah.  I turned up the sub and had it going in surround and what a difference.

Without the sub, the movie lacked a tremendous amount of ""terror"" that comes with the setting and atmosphere.  For instance, when you knew something spooky was going to happen and the aural ""fog"" came in my sub went nuts.  Granted, it's a Paradigm 250 watt RMS sub but you get the point. And when the first real terror point hits as something pounds the headboard my whole theater lit up.  Wow.

Watched on TV speakers or without a sub this movie loses much of its appeal.  But crank up the surround and the sub and your whole room becomes a coffin...just as the director planned.

Overall, definitely a scarefest of significant proportions if you've got a good surround system.  I do.  So two thumbs up.",1359849600,,1011,4.581005586592179

3997586,4,B002VKE1K2,"First off, I'm not a fan of the horror genre at all. I grew up in the 80s when horror films were made over-the-top (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, etc.). So perhaps when my fiance recommended we watch this together, I was a bit reluctant, and also expecting the same experience from those other films.

This is quite different, as others have noted. It is extremely low budget, but probably also gained one of the highest return on investment ratios in the business. And it is deeply entertaining. It's so entertaining I ran down to the video store and bought a copy.

The premise is simple enough - there are bumps in the night, and the couple suspects it might be paranormal. So they set up a night vision camera, an EVP recorder, and then go to bed. A number of increasingly bizarre things happen in the night which climax into a shocking ending. I won't spoil it. Overall, I was deeply entertained by the film, I found myself straining my eyes and ears at times to try to anticipate or spot the unusual disturbances, and was surprised how quickly time passed when it was over. And for me, that's indicative that I've seen a good film.

Only two gripes of mine (mild spoiler alert): 1) you owe it to yourself to watch the film with a good sound system. The stock speakers on your TV will serve you well for the highlight of the unusual activity, but with a decent sound system or headphones, some of the ""thumps"" or moans you hear will build the anticipation and climax for many of the scenes. So keep that in mind. 2) It was all so well-done, but the scene with the Ouija board looked pretty bad from the visual effects perspective, and was a bit over-the-top given the previous events that lead up to it. But otherwise all the other scary scenes overshadow the Ouija board scene and allow me to forgive its cheesiness.

As a non-believer in the genre, this film got me to reconsider ""spook"" films (honestly I don't think this one qualifies as ""horror,"" even though that's where it was categorized at my local video store). I look forward to seeing the next two in the series.",1353110400,,2105,4.488250652741514

3997598,5,B002VKE1K2,"Well, it's that time again, time for another damn Paranormal Activity movie. In sarcastic celebration of the release of the 4th (Christ almighty, 4th?) of these movies, I thought I'd revisit the one that started it all. The film that, much like the saw movies, somehow launched a franchise while simultaneously helping no one's career. ...how the hell does that happen, anyway?

So I'm sure by now everyone knows the basic premise: a couple of young professionals are being haunted (or hunted) by a nameless demon thing. The boyfriend buys a fancy camera to bring the audience along for the ride and we peek in as events go from bad to worse to please-just-get-help-already. It's becoming a well-worn formula, but Paranormal Activity managed a little bit of movie magic - sitting at that weird cross section of right time/right place, memorable gimmick, and excellent marketing campaign that can make a movie a success in the face of mixed audience reactions.

The polarizing nature of the film, and the love-hate reactions, are what I want to talk about most. Because, overall, I'd say it's a pretty quality (if low budget) production. It takes itself seriously, the pacing is good, and the story is simple but escalates the danger and the stakes at the appropriate times. What few effects are used are well done; simple but flawless. You never see the strings or the magician's hands at work. We get a very solid and honest performance from Katie Featherston. And this demon, this haunting presence, feels well developed. Even though we never get to see it, I get the impression it has a personality and maybe a look that writer could describe. And the tactics it uses kind of make sense, in a creepy, wife-beating, eternal spirit sort of way. So, yeah, the bones of a well done production are there. The key to whether you love or hate it is whether or not you give a damn.

I seriously mean that. It all rests on whether or not you develop empathy for the characters, for their situation; whether or not you can project yourself into it. Not SYMPATHY, mind you, it doesn't matter whether or not you LIKE these people, but empathy; whether or not you can see yourself in their shoes. Because, like I said, the story is incredibly simplistic. The couple does almost nothing to better their situation, so there's almost no real struggle against their antagonist and you could argue that its 90 minutes of people reacting. The effects are very simple; moving doors, moving shadows, bits of noise. Compare it to something like, I don't know, Drag Me to Hell for example, which is a traditionally told story with a ton of conflict, a ton of struggle and lots of loud things thrown at the camera; Paranormal Activity is practically a 'slice of life' movie when compared to something like that.

BUT!!! If you get sucked in, like I did, the fact that the things happening are so small becomes terrifying! If those things were happening to ME, if my lights were going on and off, if I could see demon breath on my girlfriend's should, I'd about lose my mind. Once the movie's got your imagination, once you've put yourself there - this is my house, my boyfriend, my life - it becomes a masterpiece of pacing and atmosphere. This home, this place that SHOULD be safe, is now corrupted by a dangerous, creepy, rapey little demon. Every little thing, every light switch, the tv, the bed, becomes a danger. Nowhere is safe. This movie infects my mind and, when I'm watching it, every little thing in my home becomes suspect. The clicks from the heater set me off; the rattle in the pipe makes me jump. Because it's the little things, the little creaks and groans, that mean SOMETHING IS WATCHING YOU!

The problem is that it all hinges on that one thing, on grabbing the audience's empathy. If that doesn't happen for you (and that's the movie's fault, not yours) it is quite boring. There's no real story, no real effects, no graphic sex scenes. Just two people living a particularly awful period of their lives (like a Chekhovian ghost story).

And I don't want to talk about the ending. There are three of them on the DVD, and I think even more on YouTube, so pick your favorite and go with that. They went with the least nihilistic one for the theatrical release, because that was the smartest thing to do from a marketing perspective. Audiences hate nihilistic endings, that's just how it is, and if everyone's dead it's harder to make sequels. We could argue about that all day, and I don't want to. The ending they ultimately picked is one, last, big jump scare that brings this particular story, these two people in this house, to a logical conclusion. On that level, it works just fine for me.

All that said, I have to say that Paranormal Activity remains one of my favorite scary movies. It's a personal choice, but the movie hits all the right buttons for me and none of the wrong ones. It's subtle and subdued while still being imaginative and honest. And, these days, that is something special indeed.

I just can't grasps the idea that a movie with basically no real story or suspense has blown up this big. I'm guessing the people giving this 5stars and calling it scary are ""reality TV"" fans that just like spying in and watching other peoples lives. That is all you do in this film watch these people live their boring day to day lives then wow a table moves, something falls, look she's floating Wow. If anything I give this movie the credit of having the best marketing campaign and profit probably in the history of movie making. It costs nothing to make almost and it cashed in big. This movie basically sold itself on being hype especially when the found footage stories died out with the Blair Witch which was also another long and boring film of watching people run around with the shaky cam and snot and tears dripping from their noses for 120mins. What's scary about a movie in which the worst thing the ""demon"" does is knock a pot off the shelf or slam a door shut. How is that scary? This films is about maybe 10-20minutes worth of actual horror worthy footage stretched out and watered down into a 110minute film. How anyone can like this I'll never understand. Being a master horror movie fan and having seen so many different horror movies foreign and domestic I'm just shaking my head at this entire series. They honestly don't even try. The first one has the excuse of a small budget but the later ones...smh. I can honestly barely write a review for this movie describing it because there's nothing to talk about. 2 people live in an apartment and talk and talk and talk about their boring problems.

And I wasn't Not scared because there weren't monsters or special effects in it. I've been scared and immensely disturbed by that tv show, A Haunting, one to many times and it plays out along similar lines to this movie, it's just truEr stories. It's... they make the scenes too predictable. I watched it late at night with my bedroom light off so I could get the full effect, but I didn't. The story moves too slow and it's, well, frankly, it's wacky. I believe in the supernatural. I believe such things are possible. They're acting was even believable, but the timing, i don't know.

Why did she do this or that? What's with the cross and why.. The questions are endless.

Shortly after moving into a nice house in San Diego, California, two young people are being haunted by an unforeseen force, so the boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) buys a camera to document this and find out whether this force is just a spirit or something far more demonic. His girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) seems to be the focus of the demons attacks and she becomes more and more troubled and disturbed as the actions of this demon get more forceful. Given the handheld camera view and the constant night time views of them sleeping in their bedroom it can be seen as boring by some and by no means is the acting that great, the story however is simple and the chills are effective.

As Micah and Katie try to figure out what this thing wants, it becomes plenty obvious it wants Katie and will do anything to get her. The closing minutes and the final sequences are quite chilling to me, the conclusion was nice and set up the sequel quite well in my opinion. I do admit to enjoying this movie quite a lot, it at least presents a simple story on the surface that does have some layers to it the more you watch it and the sequel, since they do tie into each other. I have an appreciation for it after watching the sequel and even the third one, so I do credit director Oren Peli for making something that does show how two people just can't do anything to prevent this demon from accomplishing its task.

One thing I do want to add is Katie is quite a beautiful woman, definitely kept my attention whenever she was on screen. I do recommend this movie, though I do get why people don't enjoy it, since I found it chilling I added this and the sequels to my DVD library. But its enjoyable to watch, so rent it first to see what you think. **1/2 out of 4 stars.",1349049600,,1786,4.341317365269461
3997605,4,B002VKE1K2,"Based on some of the reviews I've read people either loved or hated this movie. I fall into the former group because I found it genuinely scary and unsettling - despite the fact that my sister had already recounted the entire plot to me in detail. The true test of a horror movie is if it leaves you jumping as you try to get to sleep that night, convinced that you heard SOMETHING outside. Well this film definitely passed that test for me.

The hand-held camera work took a while to get used to, but once I adjusted to it the film really dragged me in (no pun intended - if you've seen the film you'll get this rather lame attempt at humour). I really love subtle films that take the time to build suspense and don't bombard you with special effects. What made this film so successful though was the realistic dialogue and excellent acting. I found it very easy to believe that this was a real-life couple and that I was watching a homemade recording of their lives. When the paranormal events start to happen with increasing frequency they are genuinely creepy. One reviewer made the point that: ""When you're watching time-lapse film of two people asleep in a dark room, it's surprising how little it takes to scare you"". I think this is because the film reminds people of just how vulnerable they are when they are sleeping and taps into the primordial fear we all have of what lurks in the darkness. The image that stands out the most in my mind is of Katie standing next to the bed in a zombie-like state staring at Micah as the camera ticks over for hours, and he sleeps on obliviously.

Just as all horror films have deeper meanings, I believe this one is about the dynamics of the couple's intimate relationship, and this is supported by the fact that much of the film footage is of them in bed together. Katie's ""demon"" symbolizes her inner frustration and anger with Mica, who is an arrogant fool in so many ways. Despite the fact that she has been experiencing paranormal events all her life, he refuses to listen to anything she says and carries on antagonizing the demon even when things begin to get very freaky. He refuses to let Katie consult an expert, brings an ouiji board into the house despite being told it will invite the demon in and goads the demon to give them more evidence of its existence. Katie tells him repeatedly that they need to ignore it and get on with their lives, but he continues to follow her everywhere with the camera, causing her even more anguish and distress. Is it just a coincidence that at the end of the film she hurtles his body directly at the camera?

Despite the fact that they are clearly dealing with something paranormal Micah continues to search through the house, thinking that he is going to find it, showing that he is incapable of helping Katie because he can't open his mind and accept that there are some things he can't understand or control. The fact that this is tied up with his masculine pride is made obvious when he says that he won't admit defeat or seek help because no demon is going to come into his home and mess with his woman. It is revealing that when in a zombie-like state one night Katie leaves the house and Micah finds her hours later sitting out on the verandah in the freezing cold. The house symbolizes their relationship and by leaving it Katie is acting out her desire for escape. When Micca tries to get her to come back inside she initially refuses.

According to my interpretation this film can be read as a comment on the limitations of the modern male (LOL), and Katie's demon represents the murderous urges that lurk inside all women who have to put up with him. To be fair it's not just men who can be incredibly annoying to live with, so I guess you could say it's about the repressed anger and frustration that everyone experiences to some degree in intimate relationships. Films like this terrify us by giving us a glimpse of the demons that lurk in our own subconscious and only come out at night in our dreams, while also providing some catharsis. (I found it quite amusing that the film was shot in the director's own house and that his ""girlfriend at the time"" found it hard to deal with the 24 hour film set - their relationship obviously didn't survive",1348963200,,4258,4.483247422680412

  .The actors are just average people like you and me yet they're better than half the people Hollywood puts in movies today.
  .No gore or blood at all until the last 2 minutes of the film yet it is still scary.

3997615,4,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal Activity is now a bit like Saw in that it's starting to pump out sequels that don't hold up to the original, however I do like the series a lot better than Saw because it harkens back to the better days of horror a-la the Changeling. The film isn't gory or violent, I don't think there's a drop of blood in it, and it just goes to show that horror and violence don't need to be synonymous.

The story itself is very simple too, if you look at the cover and the title you pretty much know what to expect, however I really liked the whole style of it, the husband's a camera nut who wants to film everything and this is part of the brilliance of the film's technique. There will be long uneventful shots where nothing is going on yet the audience is holding their breath waiting for something to move, maybe out the corner of their eye. Subtelty and patience are key here, Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.

Other scares are very well set up, the wife standing abover her husband for hours still sends chills down my spine, and the priest walking in the house for one second then immediately turning on his heels was pretty creepy as well; all without a drop of blood. However the ending I watched (in theaters) was pretty disappointing, *spoilers* the guy leaves the room, then gets thrown into the camera for a jump scare, then the wife looks into the camera lens and tries to bite it or something. That was a bit anti-climactic and I would've given the movie 3 stars had I not seen the original ending. If you haven't seen it basically the producers realized they could make a franchise out of Paranormal Activity(they were right) so they altered the original ending into some vague jump scare so they could set up the sequels instead of sticking with the far creepier original.

I'm probably wasting my time reviewing this, people already know the series and whether or not they like it, however I really like Paranormal Activity (the 1st one) because it shows that American horror that doesn't resort to blood and guts is still around.",1336694400,,2048,4.514824797843666

  That's the story in a nutshell folks. And of course Paramount is trying to pass it off as a true story because it drives up ticket sells. But what we're really left with is just another haunted house story that doesn't break any real ground. All the cliches are here: doors opening and closing on their own, stuff flying off furnitures and walls, the girl levitates, stomping footsteps and heavy breathing coming out of no where. While a lot of people have found this to be scary, I found it pretty boring and tedious. Several times I found myself staring up at the clock and wondering how much longer until we see the inevitable ending where the camera hits the ground and the post script comes up. Not the kind of reaction you'd expect from a movie touted as being ""one of the scariest movies ever made"". Sorry but I beg to differ. The cast of two are likable enough and they do come across as being real people as opposed to two dimensional caricatures you find in all haunted house movies. But even they can't help with a lackluster script and poorly timed scares.

  With the popularity of many ghost shows like Ghost Adventures, Ghost Hunters, and Paranormal State on the rise, its no wonder that Paramount proceeded with this movie.

The film follows our two protagonists, Katie and Micah, a young couple. Micah, Katie's somewhat skeptical and foolish boyfriend, has recently bought a camera and plans on documenting the so-called presence that seems to be following Katie, and manifesting itself as some sort of haunting.

The film is great, and follows a good ""less is more"" philosophy, relying more on creeps and subtle scares (loud noises or doors opening and closing by themselves, etc) then on gore or monsters.  It was good in the theater, but is even better when viewed at home, in the dark with friends or family or even by yourself.

The DVD and Blu-Ray release, though, is fairly weak.  There are no real special features to speak of (save for one alternate ending), which is a shame.  We know for fact that there is a second alternate ending floating around online, in addition to unused footage and a commentary track the director recorded for the UK release (from what I've heard), so it's kind of annoying that the American R1 release got passed up on for special features.

In addition, although more of a nit-pick, I have to complain about something else with the Blu-Ray.  The two sequels both included not only the Blu-Ray disc, but also a DVD AND Digital Copy, whereas this film only includes the Blu-Ray and digital copy...  No DVD, which is annoying, as although I have a Blu-Ray player, I don't have one in every room with a TV, so some rooms still only have regular DVD players, so it's limiting for now until I upgrade the rest of my stuff.

In reality, part 2 is actually taking place in the world of the film roughly at the same time this was being 'documented', so the two films do coincide nicely with each other. It seems this first offering is the one that is getting the harshest criticsm. It is indeed low budget, using no name actors who I felt gave a realistic performance as they interact naturally as a real couple would. Basically, a young 20 something couple decides to co-habitate with the female bringing in her long standing issue to the house: she has been terrorized by a molevalant spirit since childhood, but not on a constant level. Her boyfriend isn't convinced of what is happening and ends up instigating  the spirit, after being warned by an expert in paranormal disturbances to never antagonize or challenge the demon.

The entire movie is actually filmed in the house and especially for a good 30 minutes into the film, is pretty slow moving. In order to capture the disturbances, the young man rigs a stationary video camera in the bedroom to capture any evidence of the 'paranormal activity'. This is definitely a 'what you don't see is what you get' kind of fright so it's your imagination at work here providing the real chills of the film. I am a lover of classic horror and never one to be 'frightened' from graphic violence carried out by rediculous, larger than life monsters. True horror for me has been about less being more. When it comes to the supernatural, any little bump in the night is what can send a chill down your spine and that is exactly what you get here. Thumps, lights turning on and off, shadowy figures, doors slamming shut, chandeliers and plant leaves moving to inconceivable breezes, etc. It's all great fun really!

This is definitely the type of movie that will stay with you for days after viewing. Mind you, you must have an open mind and have a respect and belief in the supernatural to really appreciate what the film makers tryed doing here, otherwise, you will either laugh this one off or fall asleep before the ending...and the ending trully did give a jolt of genuine fright. The challenge here as a home viewer is to watch this one alone, in the dark, and I guarantee you will be flicking the light on and looking over your shoulder. If you do watch this with someone else, keep it quiet, and focus in on the 'video camera' scenes at night in the bedroom. Your eyes will constantly be all over the room, waiting and looking for something to happen..when sometimes it's just a noise.

One thing that struck me was that the authors of the story may have been trying to make a statement about the bizarre way some people live nowadays as they continually record and review their lives on some sort of device.  The irritating presence of the camera in this film may have been an attempt to show this modern technological preoccupation as a inherantly narcissistic process.

3997626,5,B002VKE1K2,"First of all, Happy New Year everybody!  I got Paranormal Activity for Christmas and watched it shortly after the new year began, late at night.

I see this film is one of those ""love it or hate it"" type horror flicks.  Actually according to the majority of reviews here on amazon, most believe it's a terrible attempt at the horror genre.  I couldn't disagree more.

Alright, for the first 20 minutes, I was definitely leaning towards ""This is a stinky, overrated hunk of disappointment"" just like the Blair Witch Project.  This is because we see nothing but a man and his girlfriend/wife walking around through their home doing ordinary things that all couples do.  However as the storyline got underway, I began to see what makes Paranormal Activity such a rewarding experience.

Let me state exactly what I think this movie does brilliantly- I've watched countless ghost documentaries in my time (just like I'm sure many of you have) and I believe Paranormal Activity is one of the very few that accurately illustrates exactly what the claims describe in those documentaries.  In other words, this is EXACTLY what a horror movie should be like- it captures the atmosphere and suspense of a real story.  Not that THIS particular story is based on true events mind you- but it sure reminds me of several stories I've heard from those documentaries.

Now, we can argue that many of those ghost documentaries could very well we totally fictitious or far-fetched, however let's say most of them are true, and that most ghost stories we watch on television ARE based on factual evidence.  With THAT in mind -and the frightening thoughts that run through my mind while watching any given ghost documentary- Paranormal Activity delivers exactly how I'd want it to.

A HUGE difference between the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity is that nothing EVER happens in the Blair Witch Project.  It's just a bunch of young kids walking through the woods with a home video camera recording a dreary and typical walk through such areas.

With Paranormal Activity, there's REAL suspense that actually leads to something meaningful.  You'll know when such suspense arrives whenever the characters (a man and his girlfriend or wife) go to sleep and have a video camera set up in the corner of their bedroom to record the entire nights worth of events.  The next day the man reviews the footage.

Gradually, with each night that passes, the activity gets stronger and stronger, until... you'll be gasping in anticipation wondering what's going to happen next because it just gets REALLY crazy.  I'm not scared easily, but when a film sets out to replicate the kind of stories we've been hearing for years from all those ghost documentaries, yeah, this is pretty original stuff as far as horror storytelling is concerned, so I thoroughly enjoy Paranormal Activity.

The only thing that bugged me is that the film took place in San Diego.  I love San Diego, I have family there, the people I've communicated with have been super polite out there but... I just think a setting on the east coast given the high amounts of ghost activity reported over the years would have been a better location.

I highly recommend it.  Just don't judge the movie by the first 20 minutes which is a pretty boring amount of nothingness.  Keep watching and you'll see what makes the film so frightening.",1325376000,,3373,4.856643356643357
3997627,1,B002VKE1K2,"Absolutely nothing of interest happens for the first two hours. Much like Blair Witch everyone keeps acting freaked out by everything.  Feels like a homemade movie.  The director of this movie is genius for creating something so incredibly lame but giving it that underground ""cult"" feel to it so people feel like they are cool if they like it.  I'd prefer to watch paint dry than waste another two hours of my life I'll never get back.",1325289600,,436,4.636363636363637
3997628,5,B002VKE1K2,"""Paranormal Activities"" demonstrates that creative, no frills movie-making methods can scare the pants off of people. What's scarier, for instance, than watching video playback of your girlfriend standing in the middle of the bedroom at 3 a.m. -- just standing there, and nothing else -- as you sleep soundly? Or seeing her sneak off in the middle of the night to sit alone on the porch swing on a chilly California night, once again well past midnight. The events in ""Paranormal"" get eerier and more disturbing as the movie moves along at a brisk clip. This poor couple can't escape the malicious presence that terrorizes in both subtle and overt ways: persistently loud thuds and odd noises; a disconcerting hum whenever evil is in the room; a swinging chandelier after a particularly harrowing episode; a wisp of wind that snakes under the covers in the stark of night, infiltrating its target with ease. Who wouldn't be driven over the edge by this stuff? It doesn't help that the cocky camera keeper eggs the demon on at times.

Arguments abound as the couple struggles for solutions. Following the mold of the great ""Blair Witch Project,"" ""Paranormal"" is a horror ""documentary"" that feels as real as real life. This isn't one of those movies where a demonologist cutely breezes in to save the day (think ""Poltergeist"" from 1982). In ""Paranormal,"" when the ghost expert returns to the house two-thirds of the way through the movie, he apologetically runs for his life. Now THAT indicates a problem.

Probably the scariest movie I've ever seen to this point ... don't watch it alone.",1324684800,11,1587,4.895910780669145
3997629,5,B002VKE1K2,When I watched this movie in the first time I was very skeptical. I thought (''oh no not again such boring movie with ghosts and hunted houses etc...'') but I was wrong. Very wrong. From the beginning the movie turned out to be excellent. It's all filmed with a private camera so it makes it really realistic and creepy. Really creepy. Unfortunately the end is somehow in the middle of the movie predictable and ANYWAY impressive. One little quiddle is the guy (Micah) like other reviews say he didn't make a great job but he acts not bad as well. I'd say everyone who loves horror movies will love this. And the Paranormal Activity 2 is a must for everyone who watched this. It's better than this part. But anyway I can only recommend this movie.,1324684800,,747,4.5
3997630,4,B002VKE1K2,"Predictably, it seems that the industry has begun to awaken from its catatonic state of releasing stale gore-fests in mechanical fashion; truth be told, it would take an indie director to make the ambitious leap.

Rocketed by a steady stream of justified internet hype, Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" lives up to its name as a genuinely disturbing piece of minimalist cinema, and it's a real crowd pleaser, to boot.

The story is deceptively typical, centering around a couple coping with ghostly events that slowly escalate in both violence and the ""intimacy"" it has with its victims.  The documentary-style film chronicles approximately three weeks of trauma, until finally coming to a resolution that leaves the audience shaken, albeit hardly surprised.

Although some, or even many, will be discouraged by the leisurely pace at which the film limits itself to, it ultimately should be appreciated, as the slow buildup in tension eventually leaves the audience breathless with anticipation.

Although they are growing increasingly more commonplace in the new age industry, I feel obligated to warn cinema traditionalists that yes, this is shot adhering to the Blair Witch style of film making, and yes, you will be left struggling more with what your imagination can conjure up than what the movie presents to you; the latter, fortunately, is something that only the most keen thriller director's can craft with expertise, and Peli does so marvelously.

Not to be dismissed is the acting talent:  Two no-name performers that commit to their roles so smoothly that it is easy to overlook them.  The casual humor and trivial banter that the two bring to the table is both charming and credible; their bond will certainly reach you, and it strengthens the emotional impact of each event that they find themselves in.

To say that this is one of the most terrifying films in recent history is no real stretch but, alas, its competition is growing increasingly more pitiful.  With that said, its vital that we recognize the few gems of talent that gradually arise from the masses of mediocrity, and I am pleased to say tat Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" is the next diamond in the rough.",1324166400,,2186,5.0472222222222225
3997631,3,B002VKE1K2,"Another Blair Witch imitator, this time about demonic activity. You'd think this one would have a higher potential creep factor considering its setting is entirely the residence of its characters. There's no need to actually go anywhere to run into the horror, it just comes right into the home.

This film reuses many of the same set pieces of Blair Witch, but lacks that film's rich back story, so you get no sense of history. It does have a ham-fisted back story for one of its main characters that ties the activity to her, but it feels forced.

The concept is interesting and seems like it could have worked but there are several problems here. For one, the acting is weak, especially from the supporting cast. It feels like these are people who are trying to make a scary movie. There's just not much authenticity coming through the performances.

The film is also repetitive and not very imaginative. We get a generic demon. There isn't much here that you could not see on any number of ""true ghost story"" television programs. It's basically the movie version of one of those.

The demon does not seem to have much of an agenda either. When dealing with demons or ghosts you are implying an afterlife of some sort and that in itself sort of takes the sting out of death. These types of movies need a more spiritual basis to work right, some higher spiritual battle. There's nothing like that here. Seems like the demon just wants to kill people, like a serial killer with superpowers.

If you just want a roller-coaster with a few jumps and maybe some slight chills, this might work out as a one time viewing, if you are particularly susceptible to this kind of material. Just don't think about it too much.",1323129600,2,1714,4.60655737704918

But for people who enjoy 'things that go bump in the night' this movie delivers.
The reason Im here praising this movie is because after all the 'found footage' movies made, the majority of them are bad (Yes, even the BWP) - so I went into this movie ready to bomb it.

Sure you know there has to be a logical explanation for it but sometimes, but you do get nervous because you don't know what it could be. With paranormal activity, you get to relieve those exciting moments as a kid when you dared each other to say bloody mary 3X in the mirror or told each other scary camp fire stories. This movie is psychologically scary which is a nice break from the other horror movies where it seems like the more blood used, the scarier its suppose to be.

3997644,3,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal Activity is a film about a couple, Katie and Micah, and their experience being haunted by a demon.  Although the film starts off slowly as the plot is sketched out, about a third of the way into the film (when you start witnessing the paranormal activity for yourself) you are drawn into the film and can really enjoy it.  The film is based on the ""found footage"" premise made famous my The Blair Witch Project.  The viewer is told that this is a true story at the beginning, which adds to you caring about the characters and events in the film.  The film is legitimately scary with a terrific ending...if you can get past the 30 minute mark you will enjoy it, but if you have a short attention span or need a whole lot of action, then avoid this movie - it's a character centric movie rather than action or special effects focused.

While I enjoyed the movie, the extras were simply non-existant.  The only extra was an alternate ending.  This film could have used a commentary as the story behind the film is exceptional.  The director used his own home for the film, the actors were paid only $500, one of the actors was actually the cameraman, and the film is one of the most profitable films of all time.  It would have been interesting to hear how the director came up with the idea, what led him to utilize the found footage premise, and how the minimal special effects were done.

I recommend that anyone interested in scary movies watch this - it's better at night curled up in bed, since most of the action takes place late at night in the couple's bedroom - but it is not a must own since there are no extras to make it a worthwhile purchase.",1318118400,25,1664,4.390879478827362

3997646,5,B002VKE1K2,"Count me among those who consider Paranormal Activity a brilliant scary movie.  I can understand some people not liking the movie, but I don't see how anyone can get off saying there's no suspense or frightening material to be found here - methinks some just stop watching it within the first half hour and draw their opinions from that.  Paranormal Activity is the Blair Witch Project of the early twenty-first century, maintaining a large degree of realism and constructing its scares on what the audience doesn't see.  As H.P. Lovecraft once said, ""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is Fear of the Unknown.""  Once you see the proverbial monster - no matter how frightening it might be - the fear level goes down because you know what you're dealing with.  When you're threatened by the unknown, your imagination runs wild, flooding your system with more and more fear as the situation persists.  Great horror writers know that less is more, and Paranormal Activity demonstrates this concept exceedingly well.

The story is actually pretty simple here.  Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) are experiencing an escalating series of mysterious night-time frights (bangs, whispered voices, etc.).  This type of haunting activity is no stranger to Katie, as she has experienced similar ""hauntings"" on and off since the age of eight.  For poor dumb Micah, it's essentially an exciting game that he is all too eager to play.  That is why he goes out and buys a video camera and recording equipment, hoping to catch some of the weird activity on film.  While he may claim to believe his girlfriend in the beginning, he doesn't share or appreciate Katie's fears until events begin to spin out of control.  This makes for an increasing amount of tension in the couple's lives, and that only adds to the atmosphere engendered by the paranormal events themselves.  Micah and Katie do make for a believable couple, especially in their increasingly emotional reactions to one another.  Ever the man, Micah dismisses the idea of ghosts or demons, treats the psychic Katie calls in with disdain, and insists over and over again that it is his house and that he will take care of the problem - despite the obvious fact that he has no idea what to do and that, in fact, everything he tries only makes the problem worse.  Truth be told, Micah can be a real jerk at times.

The special effects are very low key yet effective.  I think even the ""this film wasn't scary"" crowd would be a tad unnerved if they caught evidence of lights going off and on and doors moving by themselves in their very own homes - let alone saw and heard the things Katie and Micah go on to experience during their increasingly chaotic nights.  Even the more elaborate effects toward the end look real using the home video camera technology this film employs to tell the entire story.  It is astounding, given the film's fifteen thousand dollar budget.  That's right - for less than the price of a new car, newcomer writer/director Oren Peli made a film that grossed well over one hundred million dollars.  Obviously, he had to be doing something right here, and what he was doing was making one of the most surprisingly effective horror films to come along in years.

Sorry, but an invisible entity making some thumping noises, moving a door, and turning on and off some lights, isn't particularly scary to me.  There was a point where I felt the movie might have taken a turn for the truly creepy, when the psychic first came in and reviewed Katie's history with the entity going back to her early childhood, and discussed the difference between ghosts and demons.  Building upon *that*, and exploring why the ""demon"" chose her and followed her all these years, and doing more than just banging on the walls, might have made this a truly classic horror film, albeit one with a slow start.  But they dropped the ball halfway through.  By the time something physical actually *happened,* I no longer really cared.  Even the ending, supposedly ""shocking,"" just elicited a shrug from me.  The DVD I saw had an alternate ending, but no scene-selection menu - and yes, I was curious enough to fast-forward through the entire dull-as-dishwater film a second time, in hopes that the alternate ending would redeem itself - but no, it was equally as dull.  I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 for a couple of good moments and because I didn't utterly *hate* it - but I did find it entirely uninspired and disappointing.

It's easy to do so, depending on what you are expecting from this viewing experience.  This movie is a ""self-shot documentary"" of a couple's experience with supernatural events that rapidly escalate in severity.  Obviously, there are going to be moments of ""For heaven's sakes! How can you be *that* dumb?!""  On the other hand, there are often moments of unexpected shocks.  To believe that a true-life couple would lug a camera around or have one running at all times to capture this stretches credulity to the breaking point.  That said, if you allow that and other expected snags to pass by, this can be a rewarding viewing experience.  You never see the ""monster"", a point that I find makes this movie MUCH more scarey than it would have been if they'd floated by all sorts of CG phantasms.  They leave it up to your imagination to craft the monster, to shiver over its decision to escalate its attentions, to almost see it in the darkness just beyond the lighted doorway.  The actors are believable for the most part(in my opinion).  I give this movie a high rating, not for its technical excellence or superlative story line, nor even the actors.

There are things that are cool about this movie, although it's debatable whether its the most scariest movie of all times.
Good-
1. In a low budget and simple setup, the director manages to make a good horror flick enough to chill your bones. The effective use of single camera is a worth try and it succeeds too.
2. No use of stupid masks, effects, blood, murders, dead bodies whatsoever. That's a relief. This movie purely relies on your imagination and just the feel that ""something is gonna happen"". Wonderful!
3. Excellent use of realistic sounds rather than using unnecessary bangs/howls/screams or unnecessary sudden loud noises to make you jump from the seat.
In short, a nice blend of nearly realistic horror. It's effective in its own ways. However, i thought it was more of hype than the material itself (as another reviewer has stated as his review title).I think the biggest success of the movie lies in its after effects. THIS ONE IS BOUND TO BRING YOU SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. The fact that it has been shot as a home video and in a typical US house, it makes the movie so much true-to-life that you see your own house reflected in it, and thats what will scare you the most.
Bad-
1. Stupid character development. At one point (actually at several points) the guy annoys me. How can one be so stupid and one-directional even when you notice things going in the wrong way all the time? Plus, that idiot remains adamant throughout the movie and drops it exactly when he shouldn't? I couldn't gulp it.
2. How can the ""helper"" (trying to avoid the details) simply walk away when he is actually supposed to do something? If he wasn't meant to help, why he is there in the plot at the first place?

Altogether, this movie surely succeeds as a good horror movie because it's different. I guess if you really looking forward to get scared,  watch it without listening to the excessive hype about this flick. Then it will serve the purpose.

3997676,1,B002VKE1K2,"Rating this film ""one star"" is about three stars too many. Out of the entire film, perhaps three or four minutes are actually scary. The rest is a mish-mash of incompetent improvised ""acting"", a missing plot, and a failed attempt at editing disguised as ""directing.""

I'm not often genuinely mean in my reviews; I make an exception here because this film is another triumph of marketing over manifestation, of hype over quality and content. Like ""Blair Witch"" before it, this film was rated a ""smash hit"" because it was hyped into a frenzy, not because it actually had anything to say or new content to present. A few special effects were quite good, and there are a few nicely scary bits; alas, they comprise less than five percent of the film, and the rest of it gave me a headache that three ibuprofen didn't cure.

There was no ""acting,"" and the performers desperately need to review their rules of improvisation (I'm an improv coach myself, I know whereof I speak). There was no ""directing,"" it was all spliced together from the raw footage. There was no ""plot"", only a collection of events strung together from which the greatest wisdom that we could infer would be ""Don't talk to demons through a Ouija board."" And a lot of people are out good money, because this country loves to praise hype rather than value quality.

3997678,4,B002VKE1K2,"***minor spoilers***

I unabashedly love Paranormal Activity and consider it to be one of the best horror films out there. Not THE best, but damn close, and before you laugh at least hear me out. For the many things it did poorly (and it did many), PA did one thing exceptionally well.....it did a great job of hitting a primal tone and nerve. Namely, it exposed and made apparent the vulnerability of sleep, something that everyone can identify with and must do. I can't identify being lost in the woods with friends with a witch leaving stick figures outside my tent. I can't relate to seeing my daughter's head doing a 360 and spewing pea soup in someone's face, nor of Darth Maul suddenly appearing behind someone (Insidious). But I can relate to having to fall asleep every night and trusting that nothing bad will happen. THAT is the core element of what makes PA such an effective film and it honed in and exploited this aspect beautifully. Being attacked or hunted by something unknown, unseen and unexplainable (which is scary in itself) while asleep is a very fundamental fear and is frightening as all hell. It hit home, got under my skin, got my imagination running, and left me jumping at every creek and bump at night while trying to get to bed.  This film stayed with me long after I had left the theatre.  To me that is an indication of a good movie.  I also thought it was paced perfectly, was accurate in the depiction of a haunting (or what I'd imagine one to be like), and the occurrences were so mild and escalation so believable it made it even better, and made its flaws, IMO, overlook-able.

 The best scenes in the movie were not because the threat the demon (or whatever it was) presented necessarily, it's that its hunted victims were helpless because of something that they needed to do everynight that they could not escape. Seeing the footprints walk right up to the side of the bed and stop while Katie is out of it, seeing Katie stand for hours on end over an oblivious Micah, it's the fact that they're unconscious in the presence of danger, not necessarily the danger itself, which is what makes it eerie. This is why I still think PA far outdoes its sequels, as the original focused on sleep whereas the sequels elevated the occurances to normal day hours which drastically made them less impactful and more dependent on shock and jump tactics.  Paranormal Activity is one of those rare movies that does not need to be particularly well made to be frightening because it brings to light and exposes a very instinctual fear that has been with us since the caveman days. The realization that we're utterly helpless and vulnerable while asleep and that sleep is something that we cannot avoid doing for any extended period of time. The demon and all this superstitious nonsense were simply a means to an end to show this, not the ends themselves.

I think that those who simply see a door moving a few inches and lights going on and off and say, ""so what, how is that scary?"" are missing this point and the underlying goal that the movie's striving for. They weren't meant to scare in and of themselves (aside from the few scenes at the end), they were intended to imply and hint at while building tension and dread about what was to come. If taken just on its minimalistic approach to film-making without trying to look deeper than that I can entirely see why some find it awful. It really is NOT that good of a movie when viewed from a technical perspective. There's questionable acting, some plot holes and stupid plot points (most notably the psychic and Micah's sometimes ridiculous and unbelievable behavior), admittedly all of which don't help. Especially if someone doesn't or can't entertain the possibility of such phenomenon existing (though I've never understood why someone who didn't think such a thing was a possibility would go see it in the first place).

Anyhow, I can see why many hate PA, but I absolutely love it and feel there aren't nearly enough films like it.  Unfortunately I fear this series will degrade into simple cash-in releases every October, i.e. the ""Saw"" movies.  Be warned though--if you're looking for explicit horror, look elsewhere.  This is not a gore fest, it's the definition of subtle.  It doesn't show you barely anything at all and what it does show 90% of the time is miniscule.  It is psychological horror that needs imagination.  If you have one and if you can grit your teeth through its blunders and approach this with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised. Considering how this film is such a love it/hate it affair though, I'd highly recommend renting it first to see if it's your cup of tea.",1308960000,,4685,4.648125755743652

The scariest, most terrifying experience you could possibly have in the theaters?? Hmm, I digress.
I seem to remember writing a review for Cloverfield back in 2008. Oh wait, I also wrote a column for that Blair Witch Project travesty also in 1999. Needless to say this handheld camera film gimmick doesn't seem to be getting any better nor do I appreciate them anymore after 10 & a half years. I am steering clear from anymore of these ""scariest movie of all time"" claims from here on out.

Sadly, we have here another disappointing case of independent horror which seemed destined for instant cult or sleeper status. While the movie-going audiences are still in some sort of whirlwind of conflicting ideas about what horror should be & whether or not they actually like horror films, this is the saddened result of a cinematic suppository which fails to satisfy on any great level. These boring, overlong films aren't entertaining nor do they even provide a sense of instant gratification & I deeply regret having voted for this movie by investing a single hard-earned dollar at the local multiplex. Unfortunately,I can't get my one dollar back & I've lost 82 minutes of life that cannot be returned.

Katie & Micah are a young suburban couple who desperately try to battle a supernatural presence in their home while making sense of the footage captured through modern technology. Katie feels that she has terrorized by some entity since the young age of 8 & wants to be free of this evil force which somehow manages to follow her wherever she goes. Micah, on the other hand, feels he can abolish it with his overly Mano-Mano pride & doesn't wish to involve any third parties at his girlfriend's insistence. Katie does hire a psychic who convinces her throughout the film that forces are wreaking havoc within the home although the couple continues to merely record the activity & makes no attempt to evacuate the premises.

While only 82 minutes, only about 14-15 of that is spent with any paranormal activity & the rest is spent with two amateur actors who pretend to be a couple haunted by some demonic presence. I've seen better acting in a local bar by two drunkards doing their best on karaoke night. As far as the paranormal activity goes, there are no real scares to speak of. Who hasn't heard footsteps or things that go bump in the night? In fact, there are doors at my current place of employment that open all throughout the night but I don't jump at the sound of them nor do I suspect any evil forces at play.  Without the proper atmosphere & lighting, you can't possibly expect any chills or thrills from something as flat as Paranormal Activity.

If annoying dialog & slow pacing without any real atmosphere to speak of weren't bad enough, why do always find these nimrods in every handheld camera-film trying to capture every last semi-traumatic experience. If you were in a haunted house of sorts & you felt that you're friends were in some sort of eminent danger, wouldn't you drop that goddamn camera & try to assist your friends in their time of peril? Perhaps it's just me & my opinion only but this is yet one more strike against the film for being unbelievable & downright hokey. While no one really needs to shred Paranormal Activity for being unrealistic, it should be blatantly obvious in my book.

Although I'm sure there will be many who will feel I've been too harsh with one of the most talked about films of 2009, I find it somewhat puzzling that so many have offered the undeserved four star rating. Somehow this film is anything but refreshing although the box office is usually flooded with unnecessary horror remakes & films catering to the Harry Potter/ Twilight fan base. Sheesh, and people are trashing Rob Zombie's films?? Hm-mm.",1308528000,6,3793,4.746585735963581
3997680,5,B002VKE1K2,"Blair Witch introduced the ""mockumentary"" style horror movie.  ie, you pretend that what you're watching is the long lost camcorder footage of someone who was the victem of some supernatural horror.  Paranormal Activity is such a movie.  In my opinion, the only good one out of the bunch of knockoffs.  I give this movie and ""Cloverfield"" 5 stars.  The rest about 2 stars.

I think there is such a divide in ratings because either your imagination gets jumpstarted and you love it, or it doesn't and its a waste of 1.5 hours of your life that you'll never get back.  For me, it worked and I loved it.  What makes this movie different (since I don't like anything else in this genre)?

First, they won't contrive a flimsy backstory.  If you explain too much in horror, its not horror.  Its just a problem to solve.  One character calls the entity a 'demon.'  Maybe he's right.  Either way, that's as much background as you're going to get.  Oh, you do see its foot prints.  And that's when the movie had me.  I assumed they'd show unimaginative human footprints.  But they didn't.  That makes the baddie ""something else.""  And ""something else"" is as creepy as it gets.

Second, I complement the characters for the very reasons that so many disparage them.  All these complaints about how the movie is bad because ""I would have acted smarter.""  Other than James Bond, since when is the problem solving skills of a character an indication of a good movie?  Sure.  I can name 50 mistakes the main characters made.  I would have acted completely different.  But a movie showing how I successfully avoided danger would make a great instructional video, but an absolutely abysmal horror movie.  As long as I can believe that there exists even one person in this world who would act like these characters, then suspension of disbelief is satisfied.

Third, I get that there's no classic ""plot"" in this movie.  You can't make a flow chart with dozens of entries showing a flow of cause and effects leading to revelations.  But, unlike most of these ""mockumentary"" horror films, there actually are moments of cause and effect, and charater vs entity interactions, which lead to unhealthy outcomes (yes, I'm avoiding spoilers like mad).  And that's plot.  And while subtle, its enough for me, and done better than other similar films.

And yeah, don't expect a special effects fest.  And not much will objectively happen for half the film.  It can't.  Any good movie has a ramp up.  And given this style the ramp up has to be slow.  Does anyone remember Jaws?  I love that movie.  But you don't see the shark for the first hour there, either.  Ok, spoiler:  Much like Jaws, you don't see any sharks in the first hour of Paranormal Activity.

How scary?  I can't review that.  The only movie that ever scared me was ""The Omen,"" and only because I saw it when I was five.  I watch horror movies to stimulate my imagination.  And this movie does that better than 95% of the horror movies out there, and on 5% of the budget.

And for all my praise, I don't recommend the sequel at all.",1308441600,,3070,4.606679035250464

The first part of the movie dragged, there really ended up being no explanations for the phenomena, but the second half more than made up for that and I still jumped and thought it was way creepy.  It just goes to show that movies don't have to be made with huge budgets (this one was BELOW low budget) and don't have to have blood and guts to be scary.

After the original ""The Blair Witch Project"", many low-budget movies made with hand-held camera have been released and the only exception that really worked is the Spanish ""(REC)"".

The acting is reasonable, but the screenplay is ridiculous, with Micah filming their daily routine even in the most bizarre and unusual moments.

3997694,4,B002VKE1K2,"At a time when horror films are mostly mindless exercises in stomach-churning gore, it's nice to see a little indie film that leaves the real chills up to your imagination.  By using their budget limitations to give the film its documentary feel, the filmmakers have actually given their film a realistic feel.

The couple does a good job of making their acting look like non-acting.  The script is clever enough to slowly amp up the tension through escalating little effects.  The sound of footsteps, objects moving, doors slamming.  More effort is spent watching dark hallways and floors than most horror films engage their audiences.

I have a feeling that most of the negative reviews here are from horror fans who expect a lot of grotesque violence in their movies.  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a clever film that does so much more: it looks into the dark, knows there's something evil there...and then leaves it to the worst thing it can to consider this horror: our imagination.",1305072000,2,980,4.903030303030303

3997696,3,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal was a smash hit that was first created and shown at fests throughout 2007 but only got it's theatrical release in 2009. Oren Peli both wrote and directed this film which is nothing short of a breakout success with how much attention and money he has made off of it with such an amazingly low production budget. Love it or hate it you have to give Oren credit for being able to create a film that has outdone almost everything out there on the ratio for the profit margin - it honestly wasn't a bad film either.

While it's a movie that suffers from being unable to sit through multiple viewings (at least anywhere near each other), being horribly spoiled by audiences knowing what to expect going into it, and many other things that come from a low budget movie's big screen success - it was still a great film. When I sat down for my first screening of the film it actually wasn't prior to a theatrical release and I'm glad I didn't have to watch it as a screener copy though possibly at a convention would have been cool. As I sat down you could feel a buzz going through the audience as it was a showing for all horror fans (about a month before a wide release was announced.) The entire crowd had heard amazing things about it and this was before the marketing machine had crept in and managed to dull the feeling of the film many have missed out on.

The entire film consists of 8 characters even though the majority only focuses on the couple Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat.) I love how the majority of the cast has the characters retain the same name as the actors who play them. It's setup to show the couple as being completely realistic and also sets Katie up as having a chance at being a real scream queen if a few casting agents take notice as she really is able to belt it out. As I was saying the couple's interactions for the most part are completely realistic (though Micah's insistence at about the half way mark of the movie to still figure it all out on his own get's a bit tiresome.) People who don't believe in ghosts aren't going to believe that a person can be haunted and try to poke at it to come up with a rational answer which is exactly what Micah does. Katie who knows she is haunted just wants to leave it be as provoking it always makes it worse.

The movie has a very slow build up which can hurt it with audiences who have no patience in their movies though the buildup brings up quite a few mind blowing moments of suspense for those who do like a slow start. They are able to capture exactly what makes our cast so afraid of going to bed at night. It's an amazing achievement to be able to get a crowd react so much to purely suspense and not scares in a film and something that is mainly a lost art in Hollywood. Too many people enjoy instant payoffs so the slow buildup has been overlooked for years - Paranormal Activity shows that this is still a valid art form in the realm of making horror.",1301788800,2,2961,4.2839285714285715
3997697,4,B002VKE1K2,"Katie with her boyfriend of 3 years, Micha move into a lovely, suburban home and shortly begin to experience some odd occurances, nothing major but odd.

Micha decides to set up some home video equipment to record what happens when they're asleep.  As the story unfolds and the occurances start to become more frequent, Katie invites a Doctor of Parapsychology into the home to get some guidance as she is convinced the occurances are supernatural.  We learn during the visit that Katie has had a history of feeling a supernatural being at her side at night that started in her childhood and came and went over the years.  Is it back?  Is this her imagination?  Burglars?  Neighborhood kids?  According to the good doctor, he senses a presence in the house and it doesn't feel human (which would be a ghost). Since demons are not his field of expertise, he recommends a collegue of his who might be able to help since he is unable to assist.

The story line here is pretty simple and so are the frights.  The frights themselves are nothing as spectacular (or as gory) as skulls, sacrificed human remains or any oozing substance - just run of the mill things like a door opening by itself or a loud noise that might have a rational explanation (or not).  On a creepiness factor, Paranormal is up there.  What separates this from Blair Witch is that there was such a sense of isolation in the woods in Blair Witch where this could be your next door neighbor's house (or yours?) but the scare factor is still there.

I actually saw Paranormal Activity 2 first and have to say I liked it better than this one.

And that is scary. I am a huge horror movie freak. None of them make me scared, but this made me pretty jumpy and shaky at the end of the film. I even had nightmares! Some people say it is slow moving. The second one was slow moving. Not this one. Like a normal horror movie, things were mild at the beginning. Door moving and some thudding noises but as each night went by, things got extreme after the boyfriend got the ouija board things started getting worse. Door slamming shut suddenly, the hall light would turn on for a few minutes then turn off. Un human demonic footprints appear in the powder they leave down one night. At some point a huge noise was heard from downtstairs and at that scene if you REALLY listen carefully, you can hear this slight distant groaning sound that sounds like Regan from The Exorcist. Then it got to the point when the girl was possessed by the demon. The ending was most likely the most scariest part. The girl (Katie). Katie stabbed herself with a small black cross. The boyfriend planned on them leaving but Katie refused saying it will be ok. By night, Katie gets up and stares at her boyfriend as he sleeps for 2 hours. Then she goes down stairs. You cannot see what is happening downstairs since it is recorded. But all of a sudden a loud blood curdling scream hit. That scream was so loud that I remember saying ""What the heck is happing?!"" over and over. And he ran down and you could hear a struggle when finally it went dead silent. Like as if you lost volume. Then you heard footsteps and suddenly the boyfriend's body was slammed up against the camera and Katie smiled demonicaly at the camarea and it went to black.

Whether it's scary to you or not, differs from person to person. Personally I didn't think it was that scary, but it was a bit scarier than most horror films, because you really feel these characters and thier horrible situation.

You never see the paranormal-activity-Maker-ghost-thing. You can fill it in with your imagination or just think of it as an unknown entity. As I said earlier the activity starts REALLY slow. Example, door moving. This is the only real issue, and I was able to get past it. You will have a hard time looking all over your TV, because you don't know where to look to find something moving or out of place. It's a bit unsettling.

The only other problem is that it's only 90 min. long, which is short. I think the entity is here because I keep pressing the ""o"" key instead of ""i"".

Overall, this isn't the beast horror movie, but it's very immersive and unsetling. You feel the characters and see thier life. Ver good movie.",1298073600,4,1646,4.488294314381271

3997715,4,B002VKE1K2,"""Paranormal Activity"" is a poster child for the democratization of media.  More importantly, this film shows that you can make a solid 3-4 star movie with almost no money, as long as you have a competent script and competent actors.  Both of those factors are present here.  The script isn't brilliant, but it makes sense, and doesn't have any glaring holes.  The bare-bones cast (who, according to one source, was found via a Craigslist ad and paid $500 each) were competent actors who fit the material.  Hollywood polish and glam wouldn't have fit into this movie anyway.  Finally, the production design took the limitations of the budget and crew (for example, lots of static camera) and made them into integral parts of the movie.  I wish that Hollywood would finally learn that thinking and advance planning make a better movie that tons of money and fixing things in post.

This isn't brilliant; it's not gory; and it's not the best thing you'll ever see.  What ""Paranormal Activity"" is is a solid movie that will unsettle you a little, capture your attention, and entertain you for 90 minutes in a better way than a lot of other things you'll see this year.

3997717,2,B002VKE1K2,"I will start by stating, Paranormal Activity is certainly nothing new. The concept has been done to death, and this film is no different than any other of its kind. Paranormal Activity, to put it bluntly is a rip-off of the Blair Witch Project, only filmed inside a house.

The film is shot in black & white, uses shaky hand-held-camera throughout except for when the couple is sleeping. The film is poorly acted (yes, I realize these are nobody actors, but I've better school acting) and very
unbelivable and equally poorly shot. There was zero script and storyline directly lifted from any paranormal documentary found on television. Oren Peli should be smacked for giving himself the title of director/writer because neither of these existed in this *cough* film.

The best part of Paranormal Activity is that I laughed at it and its core audience for shelling out enough green for the studio to make another one (which, I hear is better but I doubt it).

Here is why I gave the movie 2 stars. 1) Micah Sloat was enjoyable to listen to when he made fun of Katie Featherston's character because she  acted like an idiot. If you are having that serious of an issue you move regardless of what your spouse or anyone says, and 2) the loud noises,  i.e. banging were at times scary, however most were expected & fell flat.

Lastly, the ending without giving it away was terrible. I laughed & never jumped. Was it supposed to be scary because it was cheesy and pathetic.

On a quick side note, I love paranormal documentaries and movies, often watching them with the lights out and at home alone but PA was lousy at achieving what others succeed at.",1295395200,,1646,4.635738831615121

3997720,5,B002VKE1K2,"I get talked into watching these scary movies. I don't know why.

Paranormal Activity was an independent film that Paramount Pictures decided to distribute.

Because Paramount got involved, some of the original film was altered (the ending and placement of certain shots in the film's timeline)

Steven Spielberg himself suggested the ending you see in theaters.

Micah Sloat decides to videotape some of the nightly activity in his house. His girlfriend, Katie Featherston, isn't as excited. She claims that ever since she was 8, there's been some sort of presence following her.

The video you see is the tape authorities found inside the house.

The stuff during the daytime is great. It's funny and entertaining; just like watching anyone's home movie.

Then they get into bed. In fact, this plays to your psyche. Whenever you see them in bed, with the night vision turned on, your stomach turns over because you know something is about to happen.

You get a heavy dose of thuds and screams, add in some powdered footprints and a psychic who is too afraid to stay in the house.

This movie plays to your basic fear. If it was some alien monster, this wouldn't have been as scary. But because there's always a sliver of question concerning the existence of demons, what you don't see frightens the scream out of you.

Paranormal Activity 2 is a sequel done right.  Taking place alongside the events of the first film, Paranormal Activity 2Paranormal Activity protagonist, Katie.  It turns out that months before things took a turn for the worse with Katie and Micah, Katie's sister, and new mom, Kristi, was having supernatural trouble of her own. focuses on the family of

Paranormal Activity 2 doesn't capture the initial awe of the first film, but it shouldn't be dismissed as a souless cash-in.  It seemlessly integrates into events of the first film, and the story occurs prior to, concurrently with and susequent to the events of the first film.  This is the only instance I can think of where watching the sequel before the original film would work just as well, if not better than, the other way around.

Katie and Kristi's family are victims of a family curse whereby a demon has laid claim to the soul of the family's firstborn son, Hunter.  Just like the original, Paranormal Activity 2 is notable for getting its scares without ever showing very much.  It relies on sound and what we can't see to evoke terror and it's very effective.  Even the way the first person camera is introduced and sustained is rather clever, and surprisingly believable, unlike, say, Cloverfield.

Paranormal Activity 2 is not just a worthy sequel, but a top notch horror movie in its own right. If you enjoyed the first film, then worry not.  This sequel retains everything that made the original great and greatly expands on the first film.

I call Paranormal Activity slightly better than Blair Witch only because more of the footage is from a tripod-mounted camera rather than handheld, thus causing less seasickness in the viewer.

The supernatural scares are essentially the same in both movies:  The characters spend more time scaring themselves than witnessing any actually scary events.  It's got the obligatory cussing and the standard jerk character who doesn't take the manifestations seriously until it's too late.  There are strange noises but very little actually happens onscreen.  I was pleased by the level of ""authenticity"" i.e. how similar most of the phenomena were to recorded cases of actual poltergeist hauntings.  It starts out with minor bumps in the night and gradually escalates into stranger and mor frightening disturbances.

The filmmaking style is simple, low-budget, but for the most part effective.  I wish it had stayed cheap and vague throughout, because the few ""special effects"" come across as very contrived and disappointing .. except for the last one (I can't say exactly what this is since I don't want to spoil the most exciting part of the movie for those who haven't seen it.)  The DVD version includes an alternate ending which was immensely more satisfying than the goofy theatrical ending (a prop which is seen at the beginning actually pays off in the alternate ending, leading me to believe this is what the director originally intended.)  Though the alternate ending is better, it still deflates the terror by showing too much.

3997772,2,B002VKE1K2,"We are truly a hype-crazed society, and I'll admit, I contributed my signature to the petition to get this so-called horrifying film released into cinemas all over the country. ""Paranormal Activity"" is proof that a little hype goes a long, long way. To this film's credit, the premise is quite clever and was proof that the filmmakers saw their measly budget of $15,000 not as a hindrance, but as an opportunity. Put a young couple in the middle of a haunting and have them record the nightly occurrences so they can better understand what is happening and figure out how to stop it. Place a few lines at the beginning of the film that set it up as ""real footage"" and let the scares begin.

Therein lies the problem as we're all aware of this gimmick and it becomes a challenge to dismiss the ""scripted"" nature of the film, especially when nothing of interest occurs for its near hour and a half runtime. The ""activities"" which are recorded each night amount to very little when you know that there is some special effect or camera trick being employed. The activities themselves - which range from a door slightly swinging, a creak heard down the hall - just don't have the gravitas they need to overcome the knowledge that what we're watching is fake. Had this footage been undeniably real, it would be terrifying and the subtleties would take on new meaning.

The story also suffers from some pacing issues. It follows a simple structure - the couple, filming while they sleep, then viewing and discussing the night's events the next day, with a little character development thrown in. Unfortunately, since much of the recorded ""hauntings"" are so unsatisfying, the time spent on the couple is dull and the viewer wishes for the sun to quickly set so we can see another haunting. The night scenes become a let down as the hauntings just aren't that interesting.

In the final minutes of the film, the hauntings do increase in intensity. It was much needed. Still, the film just doesn't satisfy and it is evident that the filmmakers ignored some major opportunities to terrify the audience: (1) an EVP which is recorded is never magnified or played slowly to actually hear what is said, instead, the boyfriend is content to just say ""it"" communicated; (2) the investigation of some image or design burned into a Ouiji board by the entity is kept rather superficial and not given enough screen time; and (3) a story arc involving another young woman who experienced similar activity which ultimately ended in her demise is wholly underdeveloped and underused.

Things that go bump in the night are scary, and I'm certainly not asking the filmmakers to have given us a film of superficial jump scares and constant in-your-face ""boos,"" but what was shown just doesn't ever hit the terror bone, at least it didn't for the group I saw it with.",1288569600,,2839,4.7408906882591095

Well, this film completely failed to scare me or even draw me in, which was a great disappointment.  I couldn't get myself to believe it, the details did not cohere into any kind of vision, and the acting was amateurish at best.

I agree with viewers critical of this as a clever marketing phenomenon.  There simply isn't much there.  When you contrast this to Blair Witch, you see the deficiencies.  BW builds slowly into a terrifying climax.  You believe in the characters completely and with empathy, even if the actors are unknown, and every detail seems to fit into a vision of terror and some unimaginable power that is beyond the normal world we understand, all with the simplest effects.

3997790,4,B002VKE1K2,"Told in documentary style, Katie and Micah are a young couple living together for the first time. Katie has kept a secret from Micah--that since the age of eight, she has been followed by a malevolent entity, an entity that their psychic [Mark Friedrichs] believes to be demon, rather than the much less dangerous form of haunting, that by a ghost. He warns them not to do anything to anger or confront the demon, but Micah is convinced he can take care of Katie and keep his home safe without outside help. As events escalate, it becomes clear that they are out of their depth, but their options are dwindling quickly. The demon wants Katie, is jealous of Micah, and neither will leave intact. A truly creepy movie that uses the mockumentary style of filmmaking very effectively to play on our fears of losing control of our lives to something unfathomable and infintely more ruthless and cunning.

3997804,4,B002VKE1K2,"Back in 1999, ""Blair Witch"" started a trend which I feel, has started to wear out its welcome. SO many movies now have the hand-held camera and unknown actors to give them a ""real"" feel, and where using people who aren't on the A-list is a good idea, this film is just another(!) one of those ""real"" films which try to look convincing, sometimes with limited success.

As any movie usually does, it has a somewhat slow start, not a bad thing, slowly building up into something which is a genuinely scary film. It is very well-staged, and several times I forgot it was a work of fiction. In many ways, this film is a retread, but some of the best ever made, were also retreads; you, the viewer, know exactly where it's going, but how it gets there, is where the enjoyment of this movie comes in. There are some surprises along the way.

The featured couple are subjected to some visits, if you will, from some unseen presence from another realm; it isn't human (enthusiasts of this type of thing say some spirits are human, others aren't), and it doesn't want to just say ""hello."" It has pain, fear, and death on its mind.

One area where this film works so well, is the absence of over-the-top special effects, and the ones used are used sparingly. If you were to have a problem of this type in your own house, this is how it probably play out. You don't need a Steven Spielberg budget to made a good scary movie. And this movie is good. And scary. Nightly visits from something you can't see, when this thing doesn't have your best interest at heart, will, in time, send you over the edge. Like ""Blair Witch,"" a major part of this story, is the breakdown of the people who are dealing with this. Psychological thrillers often hit their mark with far more accuracy than some splatter-fest; where the latter isn't without merit, in terms of craftsmanship, these kind of movies aren't particularly scary. They're just gross.

***Spoiler part***

The thing which cost this otherwise good film a star, was the ending. All the way through, it has a realism to it, which makes the slow-moving story interesting, but the use of a computer-generated visual effect in the last scene, to jump out and yell ""BOO!"" at the viewer, is the self-administered shot to the foot mentioned in this review's title. It is an anti-climax, given the standard it set for itself early on. In the features section, an alternate ending is included, which I feel (a personal opinion, mind you), was far more effective, and convincing than the ""official"" ending. It was a poor decision to edit it as they did.

But in all, this is a very good psychological thriller.",1285977600,2,2636,4.5741525423728815
3997805,5,B002VKE1K2,`Blair witch project' showed us that a video camera and a mystery could produce some spectacularly chilling effects. Paranormal activity is the result of the same experiment and proves that minimalist experiments can be chilling. The entire movie takes place in an apartment of a couple who are being haunted by a supernatural force. They decide to record the happenings with the help of a video camera and the movie is the result of the lost footage which was found later. The buildup is slow at first but the movie manages to scare us by the end. Horror Films are among my favorite genre and this is one of the scariest films that I have seen in a long time. I cannot wait for the 2nd part. I recommend that you watch the theatrical version and well as the alternate ending. I personally enjoyed the theatrical version. I Loved it.

But this is a pretty creepy movie regardless of those negative reviews and the Blair Witch-type-""filmed on a camcorder"" faux reality approach to the production. In fact, that production style works better with this film than it did in Blair Witch (which I think is very much over-rated).  Who hasn't at some point in their life felt frightened lying in bed at night and hearing a noise in another room in the house, especially if that noise is coming from downstairs?  This movie excels at exploring that fear and the ""reality""-camcorder style really brings that fear into better focus - it gave me the willies especially in the last 20 minutes or so.  Seeing this movie on DVD and not in the theater I can only imagine how much more scary it would have been on the big screen. I'm looking forward to the sequel.",1285113600,,1072,4.716577540106952

I realize a lot may find it disappointing (and with all the hype surrounding it, this was inevitable), and I remember all the fallout after ""Blair Witch"", and thus find it no surprise that so many people didn't enjoy it...but still, I have to say that I really did like it. Granted, it leaves a lot to your imagination, but that to me (and to Hitchcock, and quite a few others) is where the real terror lies; I can create something far more horrific (and believable, to me) in my mind than any special effect, regardless of how good, can ever accomplish. This film, with it's small budget and broad vision gave us, in my opinion, just enough visually to get the subconscious wheels rolling well, and that to me is where a true horror movie lives.

Everyone is entitled, and I can understand how in our jaded society, many head to the movies to see everything laid out before them; they want to be swept up and not have to do any thinking...and that's all well and good...I like a film like that myself every now and then...but for something that hearkens back to stories around the campfire or told in the dark of night, where the screen is inside your head, one could do a lot worse than Paranormal Activity.",1283990400,,1399,4.376923076923077

3997811,3,B002VKE1K2,"Banking on the added ""realism"" of using a home video camera, ""Paranormal Activity"" plays out on the screen in a fashion very similar to films such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield.""  Much like these two films, the success of this movie relies heavily on the execution of this gimmicky style of filming.

The film opens with Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) fairly settled into their new home.  Micah has purchased a camera in order to capture ""paranormal"" events that Katie believes are happening in the house.  She also believes that the ""activity"" has actually been following her around since she was around eight years old.  After a few scenes of the couple adjusting to life with the camera, we make it to the first night of Micah's experiment with the camera.  With just a few breaks in between, this is how the majority of the rest of the film plays out.

At first, nothing major happens.  The couple catches a door swaying open and shut and catch noises hear and there.  After discussing the events with a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), the couple begin to part ways on Micah's experiments.  The psychic warns the couple that whatever being is in the home with them is quite possibly demonic and that they shouldn't taunt, confront, or open dialogue with the entity.  This only fuels Micah's desire to ""catch"" a ghost on camera or make contact with it.  Katie demands that he stop doing this, but Micah insists on continuing his tests.

As Micah treads on despite Katie's protests, the events becoming more sinister and scary for the couple.  They call a recommended demonologist to help them, but he is out of town for a few days.  Instead, the psychic returns and immediately flees the home fearing that his presence might actually increase the activities going on in the home.  Who or what is the entity?  What does it want with Katie?  You'll have to check out ""Paranormal Activity"" to find out.

Before I go any further, I want to say that I enjoyed ""Paranormal Activity.""  It is a much smarter film than ""Blair Witch"" and I actually felt sorry for Katie as the events became creepier and more violent.  Micah came off as quite the jerk in the film and had I been Katie I would have shown him the door long before the paranormal activity got bad.  While Micah was a bonehead, he wasn't the type you'd typically find in most horror films.  He wanted to tackle the entity because his ego wouldn't allow him to fail.  Unfortunately, this caused a strain on his relationship with Katie and quite possibly fueled the entity's desire to terrorize them even more.

While the characters were decent enough (and not too over-the-top), the film did have a few major lulls in it.  Shows like ""Ghosthunters"" and ""Ghosthunters International"" leave out the dull hours of footage where nothing happens for a reason:  it's boring.  In this film, perhaps to capture some of the ""reality"" of an actual investigation, we often get to see long segments of time where literally nothing happens.

As for the investigation techniques, I did appreciate the fact that Peli allowed his characters to utilize cameras, digital voice recorders, and the assistance of a psychic for Micah's tests.  The use of powder to capture foot and/or handprints has also been used in paranormal research and allows for added creepiness in this film.  Peli also stayed par for the course on what supposedly occurs during a demonic haunting event by utilizing the attic of the house, the number of knocks heard during the night, and the disoriented state of Katie at times.  Kudos to Peli for researching the research.

***SPOILER ALERT***
With this praise given, I do have to knock Peli on two things.  First, while many paranormal investigators agree on the dangers of using a Ouija board, I felt that the ""fire"" event involving the board took away from the overall authenticity of the film.  Secondly, CGI works good in many films, but killed the ending of this movie for me.  I preferred the alternate ending on the disc.
***END SPOILERS***

In summary, I applaud this film for attempting to give a very real and authentic look at paranormal research, albeit with just a couple of misteps that took away from the overall quality of the film.  However, much like watching a person tackle a virus on a computer, paranormal research can be very, very boring at times.  This makes ""Paranormal Activity"" suffer overall, and therefore I give it three stars.",1283126400,3,4448,4.779816513761468
3997812,3,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal Activity is a decent candidate for a Halloween night marathon, no doubt.  I enjoyed the slow, creepy build up of suspense overall but was really put off by the all too real moron male character in the film.  I've known a few of those kinds of turds: a 20-something body with a preteen brain and invincible mentality without an ounce of common sense.  Sure dummy, openly challenge something you neither see nor understand, and keeps messing with you in your sleep.  The flaming ouija board was over the top. The demonolist who was called later in the film but never arrived was a bit of a plot let-down (I think the writer/director forgot this detail, which is why he never showed.  No other explanation was offered.)  Then there's the implied 24-7 filming of everything that occurred in the house, but the video timestamp was present only half the time.  To top it all off he closing scene was...well...dumb.  Whatever.  Still a decent film in all rights, though certainly NOT a high paced exciting one.  Very few flaws, but enough to knock it down by two stars in my book.  Plenty of creep factor though.  I'd watch it again, but I doubt I'd go out of my way to do so.

3997813,5,B002VKE1K2,"I can honestly say I have never, ever been scared by a movie in my entire life.  Everything I've seen was either gory, predictable, or both, including Blair Witch.

I hadn't heard or seen anything about this movie before watching it, my boyfriend and I just decided to rent it on a whim one night because there was nothing left in Redbox that we hadn't seen, so I entered into it completely unbiased, except for my previously formed general disdain for the horror genre as a whole.  That being said, and I feel a little embarrassed for admitting I'm this gullible, I wasn't convinced it was fake until the final two seconds of the movie.

The main reason for this is that the acting was superb, flawless.  Katie and Micah seemed like a completely average, albeit slightly dysfunctional, couple.  Their interactions were so natural that they had me believing wholeheartedly that these were recordings of the goings-on between a real life couple.  This set the stage for my believing the rest of the events in the film were valid and thus SCARED THE EVER-LIVING BEJESUS OUT OF ME.

This film impacted me like no other and nearly made me a complete believer in the paranormal.  My heart was beating out of my chest, my eyes never blinked, and I'm fairly certain my kung fu grip cut off all circulation to my boyfriend's lower arm. Once I saw the last few seconds in which Hollywood had clearly intervened and sprinkled a little special effects dust on the final scene I realized with some disappointment but much more relief that it was all, indeed, just a movie.

After my sheepishness wore off, it was replaced by sheer excitement.  FINALLY!  A horror movie that wasn't a pile of disembodied limbs and trite garbage!  I had finally been scared!  I had been longing for a psychological thriller that would actually scare me for so long that I was convinced it would never happen.  My fear may have been a direct result of mistaking the movie for an actual documentary *blush*, and I may not experience the same rush were I to watch it again, but for the first time in 23 years I got a scare!

I'm not sure if this review will be of any practical use to anyone, but at the very least I would say this movie is worth watching at least once.

Netflix kept telling me that there was a ""long wait"" for this movie that was only getting average at best reviews. So everybody wants to see it, but it is being reviewed poorly? It must be better than everyone is saying, right? Maybe people are writing bad reviews because it really scared them and they don't want to admit it?

Well it finally arrived at my house this week, and after watching I have to join the average at best chorus. It's one of those ""found footage handheld camera movies"" that's actually pretty effective for its genre. There are some genuinely creepy moments and if you watch it alone late at night it's even more effective. But overall I thought it was unrealistic and too long even though the theatrical version comes in at under 90 minutes.

I think that it was Eddie Murphy in one of his early comedy routines that mocked the family in The Amityville Horror for staying in the house even though at one point in that movie a message from beyond cries out ""GET OUT"". A smart family would indeed get out! Well it's kinda the same in Paranormal Activity, except the concept is that the person is haunted versus the house. Okay...so GET OUT...of the relationship then!

Peli took the minimalist approach on time, too, as the entire film runs only 86 minutes. And they filmed it all in ten days. And in Peli's own house!

The best thing about the film is that it gradually builds tension, never letting us in on what it is that's stalking Katie. This unknown is frustratingly freakish, and we can really feel the stress Katie and her boyfriend Micah are under as they lose sleep, hear doors slam, see footprints appear out of nowhere, and helplessly watch as more and more ""things"" begin happening to them.

As the entity begins to show more and more signs of its presence, Micah and Katie quickly realize that they shouldn't have tempted forces that they do not fully understand. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY stands as one of the strongest ""found-footage"" films in the genre. The film maintains its integrity by implementing a slow and subtle terror that is built on suspense rather than the typical Hollywood jump scares. By including lengthy segments that are relatively uneventful, director Oren Peli creates a believable scenario that could conceivably happen to anyone. When the events do occur, they are so jarring and incredibly frightening that they are sure to shock even the hardened Horror fan without ever having to show anything on screen. Micah Sloat creates a rounded character that is able to sneak in a few laughs to break up the tension, however Katie's performance often becomes too scripted and unnatural to be taken seriously. The insignificant touches that are added to the house (such as the patches of dead grass in the yard or bead table that Katie works from) add an authenticity to the characters and setting. Peli's adaptation of the documentary-style format in to the ghost film proves to be a winning combination that offers some of the greatest scares in recent decades. The phenomenal box office response served to solidify this fact, making PARANORMAL ACTIVITY one of the most successful Independent films of all time.

3997842,4,B002VKE1K2,"Have to say I enjoyed this film, possibly because I watched it after all the media hype over it so I didn't see it expecting it to be the best thing since sliced bread nor did I watch it hoping it to be awful so I could slate it amongst friends.

The plot as everyone knows is a suburban couple, boyfriend and girlfriend.  Girlfriend complains about hearing strange noises in the house and boyfriend decides to set up a camera in the bedroom to document this suspected paranormal activity (Hence the name of the film) The film then shot mostly from the perspective of one or the other couple holding the camera documents the following 3 weeks and what happens.

The big plus of this (Especially if you are in charge of the films budget) Is you have a very small cast.  The couple, a psychic, a friend who comes to visit and of course the ghost/demon. That is not to detract from the film in any way because the film is actually pretty good.  For a start the film goes right into the plot.  There is no sitting around waiting for something to happen you pretty much get an introduction from the Micha (The boyfriend) Of his intention to document what his happening to them then its on with the film.  Because its shot from the perspective of someone documenting their own lives its edited accordingly so the pot is very free flowing rather than going off in tangents like a normal feature film can often do.  There are no real special effects (To speak of) So to compensate for this the director has used silence to scare the audience.  You will be siting in front of the TV while the couple sleep waiting for something to happen, the silence playing on your mind, did you hear something?  Did you see something in the corner of the screen? Then BANG! It happens. In a way its similar to some Japanese horror movies in that its low on gore and more on psychological scares.  Things start to escalate in the house as the days pass until they reach a conclusion that you probably didn't expect.

I did like the case in this film, Micha playing the rational boyfriend very well (Though it can get a bit tedious)  The only thing that was a bit silly was their constant need to keep the lights off and rather run around in pitch dark with only a camera light to guide them (Really if the idea was that some psychotic demon was possessing the house tying to harm them the last thing you would be doing is running about in the dark)  Aside from that I have to say I enjoyed this film.",1273363200,,2476,4.354347826086957

The rest of the film is good too. I like the two main people and everything that goes on between them. What they do and their actions and responses, it's realistic enough.

3997858,3,B002VKE1K2,"I thought this movie was okay.  I like it because is had some truly scary moments.  Most horror films are garbage and rely on things jumping out at you or gore to scare you.  It's that lack of imagination that makes the horror film genre, these days, super boring. All you see is the same old plots recycled over and over again.  This movie is different.  It is scary without being startling.  It's the things you don't see that are most terrifying.  I thought the ending was particularly well done and very creepy.  The story revolves around a young woman and her boyfriend who live in a nice house.  The girl has had a history of seeing strange ""paranormal"" things happen to her since she was a child.  You find out that some sort of ""entity"" has been following her from house to house.  Her skeptical boyfriend decides to set up a camera in their room to record any strange happenings in their house.  The film, like the Blair Witch Project, is shown from the first person camera point of view.

The film is by no means perfect though. One of the problems I had with the film was the total stupidity of the characters.  They do things that no normal person would do in that situation.  When faced with an evil entity that clearly wants to harm them, what do they do?  They keep on filming and take their sweet time getting help.  The male character, Micah, is particularly idiotic in the fact that he tries to fix the situation himself.  He never seems to take things very seriously even while reviewing the tapes that show some horrifying things happening.  He hears inhuman growling on voice recordings and never seems too worried about it.  Any normal person would be freaked out beyond belief.  Not realistic at all.",1272844800,,1723,4.529220779220779

3997864,3,B002VKE1K2,"Suburban San Diego, 2006: Micah and Katie are two well-to-do suburbanites who, cosmetically at least, seem to be living the idyllic life of two young lovers in a palatial San Diego house. But Micah and Katie have a problem. Something oddly disquieting appears to have invaded their home. It bangs doors, causes the stairs to creak and makes alarming noises in the middle of the night. Being of a somewhat pugnacious nature, Micah decides to document the phenomenon using a Hi-Def video camera in the hope of getting to the bottom of what is going on - and thanks to his tenacious documentation over the course of twenty one nights during September and October, the viewer is treated to a first-hand account of what happens next.

The first-hand docudrama is by now a well worn trope of the horror genre. Films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Boggy-Creek/dp/B000G296X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Boggy Creek</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;have attempted to blur the lines of horror and fact by embracing improvised performances and verite style shooting for going on nearly forty years now. When they're done well (as in the case of ""Blair Witch"" and BBC TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostwatch-Region-2/dp/B00007JGG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostwatch [Region 2</a>]) they can be genuinely spine-tingling and when they're done badly (as in the case of the execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-A-Romero-s-Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B0013D8LA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead</a>) they can be amongst the most painfully awful viewing experiences that one ever has to endure.

""Paranormal Activity"" sits somewhere in the middle of these two extremes - its not a terrible documentary horror film, but it's not a particularly good one either.

Why is this?

Well, largely, because establishing and then maintaining the balance of a documentary horror movie effectively is a very difficult thing to achieve, and director Oren Peli doesn't quite make the grade for a variety of reasons. Chief amongst them is the fact that his two leads don't quite possess the acting chops to carry off the movie; a film like this is either made or broken by it's actors and unfortunately Micha Sloat and Katie Featherstone never really sell the reality of the situation convincingly. The other major failing of the film is it's plotting and pacing. Frankly it all feels a bit too ad hoc and make-shift for it's own good: characters appear and reappear to no discernible effect other than to ham-fistedly suggest a portentous air of ominous foreboding; scenes feel thrown in for the sake of expediency rather than narrative or character progression (the ""let's conveniently leave the house so that the Ouija board can ignite"" scene was, frankly, ridiculously contrived. Given Katie's repeatedly vocalised dislike of the board, wouldn't it have been far more effective - and believable in terms of the character - if she'd thrown it out as the couple were heading out of the house only to find that it had reappeared inside the house upon their return?); back-story which is set-up in the beginning is never elaborated upon to the point that one is mystified by it's inclusion and the twists and turns of the plot are strictly by the numbers.

So what are we left with at the end of the day? Well, largely, a film which feels like a series of warmed-over docuhorror clich&eacute;s or a vastly inferior TV movie based on the haunting/possession methodology expounded upon in Gerald Brittle's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Demonologist-The-Extraordinary-Career-of-Ed-and-Lorraine-Warren/dp/0595246184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren</a>&nbsp;(which, if you want to experience genuine chills, I recommend you pick up - hell, I'm a paranormal skeptic and an agnostic and yet it scared me so much when I first encountered it that I refused to read it after dark). Sure, the much applauded final scene is moderately effective, but even that when you look at it is merely just a combination of the famous ""ghostcam"" e-mail attachment, that did the rounds on the internet a few years ago, as well as scenes from ""Ringu"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec/dp/B0028DRGDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[Rec</a>].

Ultimately ""Paranormal Activity"" is a film that doesn't live up the hype. It's worth the price of a rental if you can pick it up for a few bucks, but don't expect anything like the chill-fest that the critics rave about on the front cover.",1271203200,4,4947,5.980225988700565

Turns out that this thing has followed the young lady around all of her life.  The entire film takes place in their home, mostly in the bedroom at night.  There is some imaginative film making here, but this is only an average film.  We learn almost nothing about the couple, their lives, or anything much except for how this thing haunts them.  In other words there is not much of a plot the way there is, for example, in the film ""Poltergeist.""  There are some scary parts, but nothing exceptional.  This is not the kind of film likely to keep anyone awake at night.

I think that part of my frustration with this film is my notion that it could have been much better.  With some more character development (and maybe more characters) this one might have really taken off.  As it is, there is some impact here, but this is overall a disappointing film, albeit a reasonably entertaining one.

You're either going to love or hate this movie.  I absolutely hated Blair Witch and never thought I would get into these types of movies.  For instance, I watched Quarantine and besides a couple ""boo"" moments I really never thought it was anything more than just another movie.  In twenty years, probably the only horror movie to scare me in any way was ""The Ring"".  I feel no shame in admitting Paranormal Activity did also.

I suppose your enjoyment of this film will be highly dependent on how you view it.  For instance, if you're watching this movie on a standard television with a group of friends and everyone's joking about the movie and pulling pranks (normal horror movie stuff) then you will not get much out of this film.

On the other hand, you can do like I did and watch this movie alone right when the day turns into twilight and slips into darkness.  In spite of the intentionally low budget feel to the movie, I also believe it is essential you have at least a half-decent surround sound system in order to maximize your enjoyment.  I left all the shades up to let the night in and by the time the movie ended, the house was pitch black and I found myself absolutely terrified.

I'm a big-time horror movie buff and don't scare easily.  Try as I might to rationalize the dumb things the characters were doing, I couldn't keep the intense feeling of unease from creeping into me, like a spider crawling up my back.  Even after the movie ended, the frequent noises in my house started to take on an entirely new meaning and sleep was very difficult.  To the director, Oren Peli, I salute you!

3997881,5,B002VKE1K2,"A young couple, Katie and Micah, have been experiencing strange events in their home, but the incidents - bumps in the night, sounds of whipered voices, faucets seeming to turn themselves off and on - are nothing compared to the escalating supernatural events that come after Micah gets it into his head to try and document the phenomena.  He buys a camcorder and a load of film to record events day and night and see just what really goes on in the house when they're asleep.

  In Blair Witch-style, the entire movie is seen as a compilation of what the camera captured.  Paranormal Activity comes off feeling very real - the performers are extremely natural, never once seeming like they're acting, and none of the effects Look remotely like special effects.  The characterization is in-depth, and it's the characters that make the whole 'recording' scenario seem so plausible.

  Of the two, it's Katie that doesn't think the recording idea is very smart: it's Katie who's experiencing the supernatural happenings more first hand than Micah (although they both hear bumps and creaks in the night - which could be anything - it's her that hears the whispers) and she's the one who's lived through this before, as she's been periodically visited or haunted, apparantly by the same entity, at various points since childhood.  It starts up, continues for a while, then disappears for years at a stretch.  And it's followed her from place to place, so the activity is obviously centered on her, not on a specific house or place.  With Micah, we have one of those rare cases in storytelling where the tale seems to tell us a lot about a character that the character himself doesn't seem to be aware of.  Micah loves Katie, and is trying to help, but I think that in the early stages his state of mind - albeit not consciously - is kind of ""this can't Really be happening.  We'll find there's some rational explanation or not, but in the end we'll just laugh about it.  But you know, wouldn't it be kind of cool if there really Was something?""  I  don't think that in the early days of his experiments with recording events he's ever able to genuinely perceive this 'haunting' as a threat; therefore he doesn't think he's putting Katie or himself in danger when he takes actions that he's been warned aren't wise, that could provoke the entity and make things worse.

  Things do go from bad to worse, and it gets increasingly difficult to think of a 'rational' explanation for the increasing activity.  Katie's strong fears from the start and her inclination that they should just ride it out rather than try to understand it, perhaps indicate an intuitive sense of just how dangerous the entity they're dealing with really is, or perhaps indicate that she's glimpsed more during previous incidents of activity than she's letting on.  She does Not believe they can 'defeat' this being, and thinks that the best thing they can do is ignore it and it will do what it's always done before when ignored: eventually go away.  Micah becomes obsessed with understanding it, and by the time he has to admit that the threat is extremely real, he can't back off.  He seems to think that he'd be letting Katie down if he stopped (even though that's what she wants him to do), or perhaps thinks that he'd be less manly if he were to admit he was on the wrong track.  Again, he doesn't necesarily think these things consciously, and that may go for Katie too, but that's the interpretation I got of their motivations.  And so, even as things get worse, the recording continues, and Micah continues trying to capture evidence on film, alternately trying to communicate with the entity or to try and find ways of directly combatting it.  All of which just seems to be bringing the being on and on closer into our world, and leading to an increasingly scary series of events and a shock ender.

  Some will find the movie too slow-moving.  Personally, I liked its pace, I liked how in the first third of the movie most of what we're seeing the camera capture is just ordinary, everyday stuff.

They do show you things but just enough to creep you out. I liked the characters too, and the acting is very believable.

3997918,1,B002VKE1K2,"*Sigh* After speaking my piece here, I'm going to seriously consider writing nothing but positive reviews for awhile, because given my short review history, some people might think I'm just a 'Negative Nelly' type of guy. But nothing could be further from the truth. I'm not the type of person who's hard to please. My wife and I spend so much money in Blockbuster, we should own a controlling interest in that company, and out of the slew of horror movies we buy, I would rate at least 75% of them decent and watchable. But whenever a hyped-to-the-moon-and-back, umpolished turd like this is thrust upon an unsuspecting and gullible movie going public, my hackles rise, and I feel an overwhelming sense of duty (for lack of a better term) to warn people.

Another reviewer said it better than I ever could, when he (or she) said this movie really shook his (or her) confidence in 'professional critics'. I'll just stick with the 'Joe Six Pack' reviews from here on out.

Now, onto the movie.

I'm so incredibly sick and tired of all the ""You have to use your imagination!"" type horror movies that have been polluting Hollywood ever since 'The Blair Witch Project' was released. Note to any 'professional film makers' who may possibly read this for feedback: When we (the movie going public) walk into a theater to see your movie, or go to Blockbuster to buy it, were are plonking our hard-earned dollars down for YOU to entertain us. YOU are the one making the movie, not us. If I want to 'use my imagination', I'll read a book. (and yes, I do actually read, alot) What movies like these are doing would have been tantamount to someone asking a New Orleans Saints fan to buy a ticket to the Super Bowl, go to the game, then put on a blindfold, insert a pair of ear plugs, and imagine the game being played, instead of...you know...actually watching it. Or asking the same fan to wait until the last 45 seconds of the game before entering the stadium.

This movie was painful. BORING. Let's watch the camera watch the couple sleeping. Let's watch the camera record a door moving back and forth. Let's watch the camera record the couple bickering. But the plot THICKENS!!! Let's hear mysterious 'bumps in the night!' Let's hear the girl scream for no reason! Let's watch the testosterone-having boyfriend challenge the demon to show itself and fight, like a ten year old schoolboy trying to impress his ten year old girlfriend! Rinse, lather, repeat. Until the last few seconds of the movie.

I thought 'The Blair Witch Project' was bad, but that movie was like 'The Exorcist' compared to this. And to make things 1,000x worse, this movie is a blatant, brazen, completely SHAMELESS rip-off of 'TBWP'.

Sorry, but if you're reading this, and you're one of the people who actually found this scary, I feel sorry for you. And for God's sake, whatever you do, don't ever watch 'The Muppets Take Manhatten', because that movie will literally scare you to death then.

I could rock'n'roll all day long and all night about how bad this movie is, but I've wasted far too much time, breath, and electricity on this review already.",1268784000,9,3120,4.682481751824818

3997920,3,B002VKE1K2,"Some viewers want a Michael Bay-style sucker punch to the senses, a film delivered so obtusely that interpretation becomes nearly meaningless.  Like a roller coaster, it's just about the ride.  Others prefer the intellectual or psychological, a tale that slowly develops and allows viewer imagination to dictate not only what is transpiring, but also whether or not the content is, indeed, frightening.  Given the fact Paranormal Activity falls into the latter category, I'm somewhat surprised by its relative success.

Rather than taking a step ahead, PA takes a sidestep with the handheld camera concept made popular by Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  Avoiding too much of the rapid movements sure to induce epilepsy and migraines, PA provides a terrifying tale of a couple's cursed home.  The majority of the film is Micah talking into the video camera about a demon freeloading in the house while his girlfriend Katie self-loathingly impersonates every bad Cathy comic ever puked onto newspaper.  The only worthwhile parts are the sleeping scenes for two reasons:

1)  When they are scary, they allow the viewers to anticipate and work into frenzy.
2)  When they are boring, they allow the viewer to catch a quick cat-nap while Katie acts paranoid.

There are a few unnerving, slowly paced scenes shot while the couple slept that could substitute for the worst insomnia commercials ever or the best advertisement for single beds in adjoining rooms in history.  Overall, however, it's just an Ouija Board clich, which is to say that there is more meat in the marketing than on the bone.

Katie and Micah are a twentysomething couple who've just moved into a new home in San Diego, CA. Katie has an interest in the paranormal and believes that malevolent spirits have been following her since childhood, though Micah is not so easily convinced. However, after several nights of loud noises and strange happenings, Micah starts to agree with Katie that some sort of ghost may have followed them to the new home. After a paranormal researcher tells the couple he can't help them, Micah decides to take control of the situation and sets up a battery of video cameras so that if a spirit manifests itself, he can capture its behavior on tape. Once the surveillance cameras are in place, Katie and Micah bring in a Ouija board in an effort to talk to the spirits, a move that deeply offends the ghosts.

3997924,5,B002VKE1K2,"I was dragged to see this by a friend of mine against my will and quite frankly I'm thinking of no longer being friends with that person. To sum it up in one word before I relive the horror. This was terrifying. Not in the jumpy or gory horror movie way that you may be used to, but in the creepy suspense filled way. Although it was filled with clich&eacute; moments and towards the end became a bit too over the top, it was still a film that managed to encapsulate the pure horror of what you were witnessing and retain it throughout.

This is a ""lost footage"" movie which is one that seems to be a genre that is developing quite a trend in recent years. This tells the story of Micah and his girlfriend Katie, a couple ""engaged to be engaged"". Katie has mentioned that she has been haunted by a presence all her life and since she has moved in with Micah he has been determined to capture this ""Paranormal Activity"" on tape. The couple, after catching a few strange things, bring in a psychic who warns them that this isn't a ghost but a demon which shouldn't be messed with or things will get worse.

Micah is determined not to let this thing beat them or be around forever so he decides that he's going to challenge the demon to communicate with them so he can give it what it wants in the hope that it will go away (see the clich&eacute;?) Micah brings a Ouija board into the house in an attempt to communicate with it, but Katie, being terrified of playing with this type of thing is furious.

I'll leave it there as I fear I've given away too much as it is. The film is entirely from the one video camera perspective and over time the events get weirder and weirder gradually building the suspense to what you know will be a culmination of challenging this spirit or demon. The acting is sublime, it really is. From the girl playing Katie that is, the guy playing Micah is an interchangeable character that could be played just as well by anyone.

The pacing of the film is near perfect. A previous review said that the pace was too slow, well I think this person was missing the whole point. It was slow and remained slow throughout as it is not an action/horror movie, it's a suspense/horror shot from the perspective of a couple experiencing this as it happens. It retained no devices to set the mood or anything like that, it allowed you to witness these events and fear for the safety of those living in the house. The couple did look like a couple and I found myself being scared for them and their experience which is an achievement.

A golden film that knocks all the new horror movies out the water and presents something fresh and new. Maybe there's something to this lost footage type movie after all.",1268092800,,2720,4.367588932806324
3997925,4,B002VKE1K2,"I've watched many ghost stories for weeks in search of a good old fashioned ghost story. The Haunting (original 1963 version) is one of my favorites. A movie can be scary or creepy without excessive use of computer generated imagery. In fact, personally, the more complicated the special effects are, the more contrived they appear and lose some degree of realism. After many a strike-outs in my search, I was pretty happy with this one. I think a person's satisfaction has more to do with their expectations of it. If you don't expect anything as a general rule, you're bound to be happier with a film.

That said, this one does not use a bunch of heavy-handed special effects, so if you need that, you won't be happy. I will say it is certainly not for everyone. Some people just don't like that type of horror movie. It is sort of the mixture of Blair Witch and The Haunting.

The acting is pretty decent, and while it does use some of the ""shakey hand"", home-video-esque filming technique, it does not look like it was done on someone's cheap home camera.

Other movies also tend to lose me when they insist on making a plot some tale of good v. evil explanation. I think randomness and lack of a specific reason for why, has a bit more creepiness.

I didn't have big expectations because lately, I've been repeatedly disappointed, even when the movie had good reviews. But this one was not only worth the rental, I plan to buy it in the future.",1267920000,,1449,4.519083969465649

I could never have even imagined the movie would be like that. I'm still in disbelief.  My husband and I still talk about it.  After the movie was over the audience clapped and I just sat there unable to move for a while. You see, my mind would not allow me to comprehend what I had just seen.  No, hell NO!!!  No way I just spent time and money watching perhaps the most tedious movie I had ever seen.  I questioned why the audience clapped.  Was it because it was a good movie or because it was FINALLY OVER!!!  Now I understand the concept of less is more.  I loved ""The Others"".  I also have a great imagination, but footprints in the baby powder didn't get my heart racing.  Nor did the slight movement of the door, or those LONG BORING rocking sessions by the bed .  OMG, I was amazed that so many people still liked the movie even after seeing it.  I could understand being fooled by the previews, but I can't fathom anything good being said after actually surviving watching it.  See, there must have been some kind of paranormal activity involved to make so many believe that this was actually a scary and entertaining movie.  And for that alone I give it FIVE STARS!!!  It's amazing how they were able to pull that off, truly amazing.  I suppose to be fair I should mention the two times in the theater that I was actually startled.  The entire movie I kept thinking, ""It's going to get good any minute now."" Finally she runs up the stairs and throws Mica at the camera!  I was like ""Thank GOD! Now it's gonna get good!"", and then the credits rolled. Oh, the other part was when the theater was perfectly quiet and this loud, non-human like growl broke the silence and I jumped!  Sadly, I can't guarantee that all movie goers got to experience this scare, as it was my husband who was snoring in the seat next to me.  Hmmm...on second thought I wouldn't be surprised if a sleeping, snoring patron was standard during this snore-fest.  I rented this movie a few weeks ago because I wanted a good nights' sleep.

3997947,5,B002VKE1K2,"I had heard many people's opinions of this movie before renting it myself.  Most were negative while the rest believed that it was the scariest movie ever made.  My preconceptions prepared me to reject it out of hand.  While I was not a fan of the ""Blair Witch Effect"" at all, I thought that it added to this delightful shoestring budgeted yarn.  The hand-held recording technique gave it a realism that would have been absent in a professional production, instead of being just annoying and nauseating as it was in The Blair Witch Project.  The actors did such a good job that it seemed they either had to be ad-libbing their lines or weren't acting at all, giving it even more of a realistic touch.  It actually seemed as if they were two normal people filming these events as they happened, and that is very hard to get right.  Try reciting lines while brushing your teeth and you will see what I mean.  Talking to your spouse while doing the same is a different matter entirely, if a bit uncouth, but people do it every day.  Now as to the subject matter.  This is exactly how I would expect such an event to play out. If a camera were present during something like this, you could expect this movie to be the result.  What really impressed me was the escalation of events.  They went from trivial through most of the film to deadly serious in a heart beat without pausing for apology. Paranormal occurrences do not hold to Hollywood scripted timelines.  I expected a picture that was hokey and Blair Witchy, but instead got something real that I found terrifying and effective in the extreme.  The common-place setting helps set the tone and the filmmaker invites the viewer in through familiarity, allowing the imagination to run rampant.  Have you never been woken by a strange noise and wondered what it was while your heart beat a little faster?  It is human nature to fear that which goes bump in the night.  As soon as we can positively label and categorize those same bumps, they lose their power over us.  By its very nature, gratuitous CGI applies an automatic label for our collective psyche to get a handle on, thereby rendering it less frightening.  As scary looking as it may be, at least we know what we are dealing with.  Splatter and gore in cinema teaches us what we already know - to fear the knife - but it doesn't lend us fear in and of itself.  This movie does, to my own surprise and delight.",1267833600,,2419,4.514942528735633
3997948,5,B002VKE1K2,"The movie is quite freaky. Its a story of a couple who believe there is a demon in their house. They plug cameras everywhere and try to catch on tape the strange things that happen in the house. They do, and they get totally freaked out.

I watched this movie knowing that its not real, it still was so scary. However I know people who watched it thinking its all true, and they couldn't sleep at night. The simplicity in the movie is what freaks you out the most. You can easily relate to the couple and to the fears they have. However there are 3 signs in the film that tell you its not real, they are as follows:

1) They stayed for at least 20 nights in the house facing the fears every night. If someone knows there is a demon in the house trying to haunt him/her, he/she would move out immediately. Even if you think it will follow you, you would go live with a group of people being realtives or friends. Worst case, you would go stay in a hotel where you know you will be surrounded with staff and security guards who will immediately interfere at the first sign of danger. You surely wouldn't stay in the same house knowing its haunted.

2) Why did they leave the door of the master bedroom open every night? This is where the demon enters the room from, and the door is what it uses to freak them out. Shut the door, put a closet behind it every day, and try to minimize the risk. Having the door open like that every night did not make sense.

3) Why did they wait until the 15th or 16th night to call the demonologist to come? If they were sure the house was haunted, they shouldn't have waited that long. They should have called him immedately.

I think he got the camera hoping to film the two of them having sex, and we see her putting the kibosh on that idea of his....  Then it all comes out about her past, and the gloves are off.

Katie has been attracting ghosts since she was a young girl, and this fits with the Freudian theories of the late Nandor Fodor, whose seminal book The Haunted Mind (1960) explored a theory that would provide a psychoanalytic explanation for hauntings and the occult--particularly poltergeists, who seem to crop up only in households in which a young girl (in rare cases a boy) is undergoing the throes of puberty, as though the spirits were drawn to this energy.  Fodor speculates that the psychic energy is caused not only by hormones, but happens only when the subject has been molested, often by an older male figure in her family.

Is this what happened way back when to Katie?  We notice that she has a younger sister whom, I expect, she was perhaps trying to protect from adult molestation by (manufacturing or inviting) the production of the poltergeist.

Needless to say, this anger at predatory men finds its ultimate expression in--well, no more spoilers from me!

I dock this movie one whole star because of the ridiculous way Katie pronounces the name ""Micah.""  She sounds like an idiot, and so does he for replying.

Whatever the media says about movies, music, world events, we believe it to be fact. That's sad. Just because a bunch of media critics claim this work to be one of the scariest movies ever, we all fell for it and went stampeding to buy it or pay outrageous money at a theater.

The story leaves alot of unanswered questions. They discover another similar woman who died from a similar situation. Ok...but how and why? The lead states that she has always had this phatom about her...ok...why? No one really expalins why this thing is about.

A gore and slasher--type horror fan may not find this movie quite as enjoyable, because it's subtleness, using bits and pieces of brief, unsettling moments to ""get under your skin."". Personally, I think movies in the vain of Saw, Hostel, Day of the Dawn, etc. have become too repetitive and predictable. They give you so many scares throughout that nothing in the film has any impact later on, say in the film's final moments. Everything that is scary is usually out in plain view, and these films are more visual in their attempts to frighten. This is where film such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, The Exorcist and  Paranormal Activity differ. They excel in taking the ""less is more"" approach; they give you brief moments which disturb you, but these foreshadow an even more disturbing end. As we see strange occurrences during the wee hours of the night--ambiguous noises, a slight moving of the door, perhaps a strange voice--there is an unseen force working against the couple. The unsettling atmosphere in Paranormal Activity comes from not only seeing strange occurrences during the night, but the anticipation and suspense of waiting for something terrifying to happen. As you learn about Katie's past, you sense that a demonic experience is imminent. Some viewers may scoff at the daytime scenes as being ""boring"" or ""uneventful"", but these moments of relative calm are sharply contrasted with the eeriness of each succeeding night, giving the night scenes an even more foreboding quality.

Many people compare Paranormal Activity to The Blair Witch Project in its indie, amateur, home-style video ""real life"" documentary ways, but I think that Blair Witch was vastly creepier, and had more logic to its plot. One of the things that irked me was Micah's way of being so antagonistic towards the entity, and his behavior  was (for lack of better word) moronic at times. Clearly this guy has no sense, and seems to be doing everything in his power to invite demonic forces inside the home, such as yelling at it, and then later buying a Ouija board. The fact that Katie stays with this guy, despite his obvious recklessness and immaturity, is puzzling. One scene that seemed unnecessary added in was the second visit by the psychic. He can't stay, he tells the couple, because the presence doesn't want him there, and is gone in a few seconds. Despite a few flaws here, I still felt it was a solid film.

Horror films should not be solely on what scares viewers during the film, but how it affects them afterwards. This is one of those films that might make you think twice when you hear something during the night in an otherwise silent house. It is the same fear that you might have had to go into the water after watching Jaws, or into the woods after watching The Blair Witch Project.

The hype given to this film before, during and after its release probably didn't help it, and Paranormal Activity would have been better to fly under the radar, mainly because it doesn't appeal to most. Still, for what it's worth, I praise a horror movie that can create spooks with what you don't see rather than what you do.",1267315200,,3205,4.777978339350181
3997977,5,B002VKE1K2,"Seeing the copious amount of reviews already posted about this film, I was reluctant to post a review at all.  But I do enjoy the film, and I think it deserves praise.

Yep, I give it five stars.  I was lucky to see this film when it fell into demand and was shown ""selectively"" at a free screening in Chicago.  My buddy went with me; a horror film aficionado and in the MFA program with me at Columbia.  We sat down, not sure what to expect, except it probably used the same formula as BWP did ten years ago.  (BWP is one of only three films that I saw at least three times in the theatre)  Same formula, so what!  This movie, though predictable most of the time, really kept me on edge and anticipating each night of activity.

It has a very simple A to B sort of timeline, each night escalates in activity.  Things get weirder and more ""clues"" arise as to the cause/reason/source of the activity, etc.  Though my friend almost never jumps or covers his face during scary movies, he and I were on edge the entire show.  To quote him, ""I am never that scared.  What you saw is rare, I haven't been scared like that since I saw Blair Witch"".  And it's true, it does have definite ties to BWP, and in a sense it is the exact same film, con temporized to the current decade.

Go into it with an open mind, hoping and expecting to get scared.  It's unnecessary to question and point out the validity, likeliness, and theoretical elements of the story.  Of course its unrealistic and a rather silly premise to begin with.  Ouija boards, demonologists, EVPs and video footage.  All of that!  But what horror films aren't cheesy?  You should go into it expecting to enjoy a good fright.

I found that I was often jumping and indeed covering my face in anticipation of what scares might come next.  Get over the ""hype"" of the film and don't prepare to be judgmental before you've even seen it.  Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did in the theatre.  Viewing it a second time at home, it still had the same lasting effect on me as it did the first time I saw it.

It's safe to say if you enjoyed BWP then this film you will also enjoy.  But hey, it's not for everyone.",1267228800,2,2177,4.25916870415648
3997978,5,B002VKE1K2,"Let me preface this by stating that I skipped most chapters to solely watch the ""meat"" of the film, as in the bedroom scenes.

To me, this film works and has the adverse effect that it seems to have intended. I am a 40 year old man with a rational mind and also the parent of two teens. My daughter wanted to see this with me and I obliged just out of my own curiosity. I'd heard mixed opinions and am not a big fan of the ""home video"" style of film making as the shaky camera tends to get on my nerves. Suffice to say...I did watch this tonight and am having a difficult time sleeping. Hopefully, writing this review will exorcize my own inner demons.

On the surface, yes, the story itself is cliched and pretty derivative. What few daytime scenes I did watch were pretty dull and contrived. The Micah character, for all intents and purposes, was pretty idiotic to the point of laughability. I even made the point that his demise at his possessed girlfriend's hand was a prime example of ""natural selection"" and deserved his fate.

To me, the movie works on the principle as stated in my review's title. Whether you believe in ghosts, apparitions, or demons, is irrelevant. Anyone that has ever had that uneasy feeling at night can relate, even in some basic and primal way, to the intended scares here. It brought to mind an incident a while back where my wife and I were sleeping...deeply I might add...only to awaken to find our teenage daughter standing by the bedside. Granted, she was wanting some cough medicine and was having a difficult time sleeping. However, awakening from a deep sleep to find a teenage girl hovering over me was an instant jolt. Not that she was trying to scare..or intended any harm for that matter. It's the stark realization that when we are in our deepest sleep, we are ultimately at our most vulnerable. You would be lying if you can say you've never been awaken by a noise at 2:30 in the morning and immediately unnerved and filled with a momentary dread. We grownups know the boogie man doesn't really exist, but that's not to say that there isn't the possibility that the ""unexplained"" can't be just as terrifying.

I guess, in short, this movie spoke to me because I have enough sense to know that I don't have all the answers and can't simply explain away every single night terror and sensation of fear I have ever felt in the dead of night. It's a deep and primal emotion we all have, even the most jaded of us. Fear of the dark is natural and part of our psychological make up. While we all know nothing is really there, it is ultimately the fear of the unseen/unknown that taps into that survival instinct.

I read also that there is interest in a sequel. Just like Hollywood to take something fresh and just ruin it with more of the same.. Standing alone, I think this film has ""classic"" potential. The lack of a musical score, the cleverly shot ""occurences"", and over all effect just make this one I will likely watch again. I have to commend the director for taking the Speilberg/Hitchcock approach by making the effects subtle and allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with their own imagination. This is the first horror film I have seen that actually frightened me since ""The Exorcist"".

It's such a shame that, despite it's success, there are so many people out there that are so jaded to think that this film fails to provide scares. To me, the best scares aren't the disembowelments and in your face gore fests...it's all about the unknown and unseen.",1267142400,2,3510,4.519685039370079
3997979,4,B002VKE1K2,I'm a wimp. I can't handle stuff like this anymore. What makes it worse is that I had to use my own imagination from much of the creepy stuff. Now when I have to use my own imagination things get spookier for me. My imagination will go crazy. I watched the video with the alternate ending and I will say that the ending was too graphic and not necessary. She could have just sat there and I would have been seriously freaked out.,1267142400,,429,4.180722891566265

3997982,5,B002VKE1K2,"Fortunately I'm one of those folks that turn a deaf ear when anything is hyped to the highest degree. Has anyone ever had their breath taken away from a movie? In any case I just watched this movie not knowing what to expect and I had no prejudice to contend with. The film begins abruptly like a shaky home video and it effectively establishes the characters environment and surrounding which is an over populated suburban neghborhood in San Diego ,pretty pedestrian stuff. This is where the screenwriter/director really demonstrates genius, this very innocous and plane jane home becomes a threatening and menacing place as the film progresses. All the chills and scare with the exception of a couple of the scenes are all in your imagination. This approach is used to great effect in this film and scared the daylights out of me. The film resonates with the viewer well after the film concludes. Watch this film at home alone in the dark and then see if this film effective or not. The screenwriter/director succeed in making the ordinary terrifying. The last scene is one of the creepiest I've seen since The Exorcist. Does this film have its foibles, yes but realize that the film was made for $15,000 in ten days! Hollywood is littered with innefective expensive horror films (The Haunting remake comes to mind) This film is not for the ADD/texting generation or the people who get a kick out of graphic diembowelments or torture. This is torture of the mind in the Hitchcockian tradition.",1266710400,,1495,4.821011673151751
3997983,1,B002VKE1K2,"Ooooooooo scariest movie ever.  Please.  I've taken bowel movements scarier than this movie.  Mercifully I don't own it, and didn't even have to spend money to watch it as a friend had rented it.  I would have rather had body parts amputated without anesthesia.  Oh no, random noises!  Scary.  A girl standing by her bed!  Even scarier!  Her sleepwalking!  That was the scariest part of the movie.  I feel sorry for anyone who actually spent money to watch this.  I feel even sorrier for those of us who sat through this slop.  I want my time back.  I was cheated.",1266624000,6,564,4.51
3997984,2,B002VKE1K2,"This is the classic example of the over-hyped movie. All I heard was how ""scary"" this movie was and how I would sleep with the lights on for a week after watching it. It wasn't to be. There are a few moments of genius but they fail to scare. Whatever is haunting the couple's house is an uncreative spirit. One night it only manages to move their bedroom door a couple inches. Gasp! Terrifying! If I was the ghost I would place their hands in warm water or drag their bed downstairs so they would wake up in the kitchen! The film spends too much time on miniscule ""scares"" with the only legitimate ""scare"" coming at the end, it's cool but predictable.
You could probably fast forward 40-50 minutes of the movie and not miss anything.
Not bad, not good.",1266624000,5,752,4.378571428571429
3997985,3,B002VKE1K2,"What's creepier than unseen things that go bump in the night?  I live on the intersection of Nowhere and Too Late, quite a ways from the next neighbor.  One calm, windless night, while working in our big garage around 3 a.m., I listened with a certain hair-raising thrill as the east sliding bay door made a repeated rapping sound.  No wind, mind you, not a blade of grass stirring and the right bay door perfectly still and silent.  I looked around and saw nothing.

Beats me what it was.  Maybe a big spectral rat was digging under the sill plate.  ""Paranormal Activity"" was this kind of movie, where you don't see the beastie, only its effects.  The show was somewhat spooky, but truth be told, the ""Blair Witch Project"" stole its thunder.  You knew this wasn't real, and there's something about ""Activity's"" setting in a modern, spacious house that just wasn't as chilling as being lost in the dark woods with some kind of supernatural critter on the loose.

Another truer note from ""Blair Witch"" was that the kids were trying to get away.  The young couple in ""Activity"", however, particularly the moron boyfriend, insisted on staying in the house until the end.  Sure, they were told that the demon would follow them.  But I'd have burned rubber getting out of the house anyway, if only to shake the demon for a day or two.

On the other hand, although the boyfriend was pigheaded about staying, turning down help, and ultimately leading them to disaster, he did stick around when it was clear that the demon was only interested in his girlfriend.  How many guys would care enough about their girlfriends to tell Beelzebub to take a hike?

The movie worked fairly well, then, but not extraordinarily so.  The girl's being dragged out of bed by an invisible force was effectively scary, but both endings to the show were out of sync with the approach of the whole show previously.  Especially the main ending, which made a sort of manifestation of the demon in an unlikely way.

What sticks with me is how eerily similar the noise the demon made when it was haunting the couple's bedroom to the sound long freight trains sometimes make out here, some five miles away, on a quiet summer's night.  The same throbbing and muted rumbling you can hear through the walls.  Time to exorcise some trains?",1266537600,2,2301,4.6600496277915635
3997996,4,B002VKE1K2,"Most of the negative reviews I've seen about Paranormal Activity are based on the level of ""boredom"" that the viewer had. Sadly I would attribute this to years of scary movies showing you what you should be scared of rather than allowing us to see just enough to let the mind fill in the blanks. Many people today have a hard time using their imagination when going to the movies because they are so use to movies filling in all the visual blanks for them. While I would agree to an extent with the ""boredom"" and lack of scariness during the first 15-20 min. (keys dropping, lamps shaking, pounding on walls...stuff like that) it did eventually pick up. The low budget Blair Witch documentary style simply adds to the believability of the story. I'd also add that if you even remotely buy into the possibility of demonic forces...by the end it will scare the hell out of you.",1266278400,,875,4.544303797468355
3997997,4,B002VKE1K2,"Those of you who ""weren't"" scared, it sure feels like you're just trying to show off and laugh it up so that you can make your fightened soul feel better. Watch it again alone (so that you won't feel obligated to laugh in order to show that you're brave) and watch it at night and try to go sleep... alone and with no lights on. While you're trying to sleep, think of the scene where the sheets are moving by themselves... or try to sleep with your leg hanging over the edge of the bed... I know the bravest man on Earth will be scared. Even just a little. Heck! I'm brave. I'm not easily scared. I'm not afarid of the dark. Yet, i do think of the movie from time to time when i close the lights. OK, i think of it with a smile cause to feel a bit uneasy is kind of silly but still, i think of it.

You liars.

I'm not talking about the movie itself. I can understand that some of you didn't like the structure, the acting, the point of view or whatever. But what it was suggesting... if it didn't even make you feel a bit uneasy, well i simply don't believe you. It's my choice and i stand by it. If you're not a little bit scared by it, you're lying. A little, i'm saying. Not a lot. Not trembling. Just a bit uneasy. Even if you don't believe in that kind of stuff... which i don't. But we all have imagination.

""Serious"" movies about ghosts or demons always have a different effect on me than any other horror movies as they deal with something you can't really explain. I'm not talking about ""Constantine"" or something deliberately overblown here...

No hollywood-type special effects, no gore or monsters, no music. Everything is made to look normal, amateur-style and very, very minimalist. The authors have the brilliance to protect themselves by making one character (the boyfriend) a bit resistant to what's going on. Like most of us, he doesn't necessarily believe what's happening. Like all men, he wants to show to his girlfriend that he is in charge. That he isn't scared. So by the time he doesn't have a choice but to actually BELIEVE, we, as a spectator, also believe. For the time of the movie, of course. After it's over, we know it was just a story but while it lasted, we agreed to believe it. That's the whole point of cinema: to make you believe while the movie last. AFter, you discuss it.

Also, the film make it a point to warn us that the house is not at fault here. It's the girl. Wherever she goes, the entity WILL follow. She just has to deal with it. It doesn't matter if she always sleeps on the same side of the bed, beside the door or not. It doesn't even matter if that darn door is closed or not. IT will come after her. It will possess her! So this argument of putting the movie down because she never changes her position in the bed or because they never leave the damn house is not valid. It will follow her wherever she goes. And the boyfriend will ALWAYS be seen as an enemy.

The film deals with little things that are sure to scare us. Strange noises, afraid to sleep with one arm or one leg hanging over the edge of the bed, surreal shadows, an object misplaced, the sensation of being watched, invisible footsteps, strange footprints, etc... The filmmakers let our imagination do the rest. Even Spielberg agreed to that when he wrote ""Poltergeist"" even if his movie was a lot more special effect oriented. The little things, he said, are what scare us the most.

The end may be a bit overblowned but at this point, the desired effect is successfully integrated in our soul. We are scared stiff! And it will leave a mark...

The alternate ending is more ""believable"" but makes you wonder why would the entity do all this, for all those years, simply to do what it does at the end.

I would have loved for the movie to keep on going and see actual professionals take care of the girl. A bit like ""The Entity"". It would have been the natural path, i suppose. But that wasn't the idea here. Things happen too fast and one expert has left them alone has they are waiting for another one to show up.

Gee-whees, just having the girl get up and stand rigid over the bed, watching her boyfriend sleep for hours, is enough to get your blood going. At the end, when the entity actually becomes physical, it becomes a lesson to all filmmakers on how to genuinely scare an audience. Just like the first ""Blair Witch Project"".

Very good movie. Very frightening. The kind of movie you can dare a friend to watch. But that friend has to watch it ALONE, AT NIGHT, IN THE DARK and WITHOUT ANY INTERUPTIONS. Or else, the desired effect is lost. Like ""Blair Witch #1"", watch it with someone else and you won't be scared as much. Leave the light on or talk or get up to do something else while the movie is still playing and you've wasted the whole point of watching it. Cause the sacry parts are in the little details and the general athmosphere.

After that, if that friend tells me that he wasn't scared, i'll know that he's lying and that's just his or her way to feel brave.

I'm saying all of this with a smile of course. Everybody has their own opinion. I simply have serious doubts over those who play brave or jaded about it.",1266192000,2,5161,4.330227743271221

I also would NOT have burned a cross assuming that would scare the demon away.",1266192000,19,570,4.53921568627451
3998000,3,B002VKE1K2,"First, let me say that what goes on in this movie is very much like a real haunting, but you can see this info on Ghost Hunters and other TV shows. That makes this movie nothing special. I've personally experienced water turning on by itself, lights coming on and off by themselves, sounds of drawers opening and closing, doors opening and closing, objects moving around the room, the bed shaking, scratching noises in the walls, whispers, and footsteps in the attic.  I've also awakened to find my eyes have been open for hours and, when I was little, I would walk in my sleep occasionally. Most of these occurrences, I can chalk up to the same conclusion I had regarding this movie--psychokinetic energy. It is very similar to poltergeist activity, only the energy comes from you.

The main characters decide to move in with each other. The woman having previously been aware of some unusual haunting-like behavior having gone on around her, warns her boyfriend of this unsafe possibility. He is fascinated and buys a video camera to see if they can catch activity on tape. Various bumps in the night occur, generally while she is sleeping. They do contact a psychic, who is too afraid to deal with the problem. They try various ways to prove the existence of an actual entity in their house, but the woman is afraid to press the issue and possibly anger the being. The ending was what I expected. If you liked the Blair Witch movies, you probably will find this an enjoyable viewing, but it really doesn't even rank up there with those movies. It is more like an amateur video you would see on You Tube, just a home video that is poorly edited.",1266105600,3,1647,4.617747440273037

The attic scene with the picture, the scream from downstairs, moving blankets, powder footprints, etc. all were examples of things were genuinely frightening. We had just watched Halloween II (Zombie version) before this (what a piece of crap that was), and despite all the gore in that, it wasn't scary. PA WAS!!! The last 2 minutes had my heart pounding--don't really think that's happened while watching a horror flick in years. I dare say that was one of the scariest things I've ever seen in a horror movie.
I know, I know--things that go bump in the night---ooooh, scary!! I'll tell you what--if I heard screams in my house, footprints on the floor, broken pictures, and doors that closed by themselves, the local priest would be at my house pronto!!

You may want to slug Micah with his camera and his refusing to let Kate call the demon expert in until too late but men are like that.  Too sure they can fix things themselves.  But as with all great horror movies, you have to let the movie take over and you sit back and enjoy the ride.  What is best about it, is low or non-existent special effects.

I should have done the work...  I feel like I wasted time I could have used to do ANYTHING more important.

To begin with, I kept waiting for something really terrifying to happen.  It never did.

2nd - I wanted to like Micah.  You know, the devoted boyfriend.  But he really got on my nerves as the movie wore on.  First he let his girlfriend order him about like a child, and I found myself thinking, ""He needs to grow a pair.""  Second, had any of this been legit or real, how realistic is it that he would 'challenge' the entity as he did.  Yelling out to it that it can't come in to 'his house' and blah blah blah.  Like a demon would care.  Like anyone in that situation would think they could challenge one.  A bit strong with the testosterone flow.

I consider it on the same level as that movie made by college kids on a school project in the woods.  This is my personal opinion of this movie.  You might really enjoy it.  Amazon has the best prices around and excellent service, I received mine within two days of my order.  Mary",1265760000,3,532,4.29
3998026,4,B002VKE1K2,"I'm a big fan of scary movies.  However, most of the scary movies I watch may make me jump while I'm watching them, or feel nervous or scared while they're on, but after the movie is over, I quickly forget all about them.  Every once in a while, I watch a movie that leaves me feeling unsettled and scared long after the movie is over - Paranormal Activity was one of those movies.

I found this movie genuinely frightening.  Its not the type of movie that makes you jump (with one notable exception) - rather it creates this sense of dread that just gets worse and worse as the movie goes on.  It does not rely on gore or special effects, just on the susceptibility of your imagination.  This is not a movie for everyone.  You need to have an open mind, a good imagination, and be someone who believes that, just maybe, possession and demons can exist in a nice San Diego suburb.

This is a low budget movie that never leaves the house of Micah and Katie.  There is quite a bit of dialogue in this movie and many times where nothing is happening on screen.  This invoked in me a sense of fear and anticipation, however, I can see how other people could find this extremely boring.

The only problem I had with this movie was the shaky cam.  It definitely lent a sense of realism to the movie, however, it gave me a headache.  Anyone prone to motion sickness may need to look away periodically while watching this movie or they may find themselves getting sick instead of scared.

If you like scary movies that leave you with an unsettled feeling that has you looking around nervously every time your house creaks, I think you will really enjoy this movie.  If you prefer your horror gory and action-filled, you won't find those kind of scares here.",1265673600,7,1749,4.421875

Do they have something inside them that could destroy you?. Sometimes you don't even see it coming.  Sometimes you don't want to see...like you're asleep.  Watch this movie with an open mind.

3998029,5,B002VKE1K2,"There's a good reason to have a bias against films that employ the ""we're shooting a documentary and this is real life"" method. It pretty much failed in ""The Blair Witch Project"", though that was nowhere near as terrible a movie as most make it out to be, and it has spawned numerous imitators which don't even deserve mention. But ""PA"" is not an example of that. No, the plotline is never honed down to a tee, and no, it's not perfect, but it's better than the majority of the stuff out there.

Katie and Micah are a young couple (one of the only things I found hard to believe about this movie is that Micah owns a huge house sack with a boulevard and swimming pool and looks like he's getting his first five o clock shadow). Micah is a businessman, and Katie is an Eng major. Katie has been the victim/conduit of a supernatural force since she was eight years old, and yes, we can safely blame her for getting this poor schmuck involved: as he says, ""maybe you should have told me on our 100th date that your were haunted by a demon, okay?"". The premise is no more unbelievable than most horror flicks. Micah is all Wall Street, and let's face it: when Demon meets Wall Street boy, it's going to be love at first sight.

Thus he acquiesces to every moronic impulse he has: buying a Ouija which looks less like a Ouija board and more like a ""Black Red Let's Invite Satan In For the Night"" piece of cardboard, even after being advised by the entirely believable, hippy dippy parapsychologist to NOT DO THAT. But you have to give the guy a break: he's not an English major, he's a would be member of the Billionaire Boys' Club and he's doing the best he can. (And what was so ""unbelievable"" about the ""psychic""? He looks exactly like an aging baby boomer who gave up on trying to change the world and now wants to experiment with ""different areas of being"", dig?)

This is Hitchcock, so anyone and everyone--I think they're sort of the same group when it comes to people who watch horror movies these days--who want to see stabbings, mutilations, all the new trendy ""Saw"" ways we can watch people get tortured to death should stay away and not bitch. The theme is indeed ""Things That Go Bump In the Night"". The movie borrows heavily from the Exorcist, as all demon films do, only neither of these characters once has the sense to at least get a book about Catholic theology when it's pretty obvious what they need is a priest. The reason is simple: they are, both of them, already heavily under the influence of whatever is in the house. Micah assents to the thing's will when he starts acting stupid, and even invites it into their bedroom with the powder on the floor. When Katie stands and watches her boyfriend/husband/whatever in the wee hours of the morning and swaggers around, that's the demon. (See? Use your imagination!) Micah swaggers the same way in one of the ""nighttime"" scenes. The reason they do not call the demonologist on time and that they cannot handle taking even one sane simple step, like leaving the house, is because Katie's nemesis has begun to infect Micah as well. Nope, they don't act believable all the time, and guess what, sometimes characters in Dostoevsky don't either!

They find out far too late what the real problem is, that this entity is a destructive force which wants Micah dead first, then Katie, and to move on. The continuing state of denial before the so-so but ultimately terrifying finale is not because they are stupid (at least not Katie), it is because the demon has gotten everything it wants and then goes in for the kill. It knows there will be no demonologist, no clerical intervention, so it goes buck wild.  Calling Father Merrin would have been a pretty obvious move.

The ending could have been more (why the CGI computerized mouth crap? that could have been a classic scene) but nonetheless is pretty scary. It finally has her. I think a mix of the alternate ending and the original would have been appropriate. This is a very, very good horror film, worth owning.",1265500800,3,4026,4.538567493112947

The Invisible Nemesis from Beyond used to be a premise of stories of the supernatural a hundred years ago, but very few films are done these days to depict such a thing.

3998061,3,B002VKE1K2,"Shot with a Sony's video camera and made with a modest budget of $15,000, ""Paranormal Activity"" proved a big hit (more than $ 100 million in US alone) and has already garnered critical acclaims everywhere (81 % positive reviews according to the rottentomatoes site). I can understand the first part - we still remember the hype of ""The Blair Witch Project"" back in 1999 - but as to the latter, well, frankly I don't know what to say.

I'm not saying ""Paranormal Activity"" is a total disaster. The film is not entirely scare-free and I confess I jumped in the seat several times. But writer/director Oren Peli overuses the ""jack-in-the-box"" type routine such as sudden big noises and clich&eacute;d visual tricks. The image from the static camera showing the two protagonists is creepy at first, but it gradually becomes predictable, if not boring, for most of the horror fans.

The story is OK, just a usual one about two residents, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) living together in a San Diego house, terrorized by some ""entity"" and the paranormal activity that gets worse. The acting is acceptable, but as the story goes on, some viewers might think to themselves: ""But I wouldn't leave the door open when I know my house is haunted"" or ""I wouldn't continue to shoot a camera when my girlfriend is obviously terrified and in danger."" In fact, the character of Micah is so annoying and even stupid that by the time the film wraps up, I stopped to care what happens to them.

3998062,4,B002VKE1K2,"I am not believer in ghosts- or anything within the realm of the paranormal.  I am too much of a pragmatist to believe that there are lost souls out wreaking havoc on the living, terrorizing for the sake of terrorizing.  There's something, however, about a good ghost story that I just cannot pass up- the more realistic, the better.  This story definitely had me thinking throughout ""wow, this feels so real...""

This movie works for a number of reasons- the most important of which is the first-person camera view.  I don't think that this could have been done any other way.  The very premise of this story is when Micah, the boyfriend, decides to document his new live-in girlfriend Katie's claims that she's been plagued by bizarre and unexplainable events throughout her life since she was a young girl.  Micah, a determined skeptic, sets up cameras in their bedroom and other locations throughout the house, hoping to capture or debunk his girlfriend's claims.  The use of time-lapse and pausing during significant events seemed to add to the palpable anticipation.  The very fact that the house itself is not haunted- but one of the occupants is- definitely added to the eerie twist.  Each time in my mind when I urged them to leave, I was reminded of that fact, which continued to compound the intensity of the story.

What also makes this film work is that it quite simply continues to work on your imagination.  It doesn't make use of any cheesy effects or spooky apparitions.  Scary sounds and unusual events occurring at various times had my heart racing and were well done.  From the deep trembling bass coming from within the house to the scenes when Katie would rise at night, standing next to the bed transfixed for hours, I kept thinking we have ourselves a good story.  The very setting- a normal tract home in the suburbs and not some spooky looking mansion- further strengthened the story's credibility.  The ending in the theatrical version is indeed very creepy, having you wondering what exactly was happening out of the view of the camera.

Few scenes within the story seemed overdone, but there are a couple worth noting.  One is when Micah is led to an open attic door in the house.  Upon investigating he discovers a photograph of a young Katie, lying on top of the attic's insulation, that was thought have burned up in a house fire many years prior.  While scary, it snapped me out for a moment from what was a great spooky nightmare with all of the trappings of a credible ghost story.  One of the few phenomena taking place during the day featured damage to a photograph of the couple, whereby most of the damage seemed to take place over Micah's part of the portrait.  Micah's exuberance and at times over-zealous determination were the few points against this movie.

This movie is worth watching.  You can see from the reviews already cast that you will either love it- or you will hate it.  It is a great low-budget flick with fairly good acting and overall a great storyline.  If you have any imagination, prepare to be scared.

Brilliant, truly scary and very psychlogical supernatural independent thriller from writer-director Oren Peli is one of the best horror movies of the new millenium. Here is the movie that became an unexpected box-office hit for three weeks in October of last year thus beating SAW VI's record, what works about this movie is that it doesn't go for self-parody like ""Scream"" or torture horror like ""Hostel"" as it harkens back to the days of supernatural movies like ""The Haunting"" or ""Poltergeist"". It's all done in the eyes of a handi-camera much like ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""REC"" or the overrated ""Blair Witch Project"" all did but i think this one is superior to ""Blair Witch"" as it's more scary and more realistic. Yes the acting is bland but it's a b-movie you know and all b-movies have bad acting but the storyline is very good and this one makes it look like an actual report of a poltergeist instead of being a hollywood movie.

The original reviewer nailed it, it's the unknown suspense that makes it great....a big, gory payoff and/or lot's of typcial hollywood scare tactics is probably what today's generation of moviegoers want or need but this was crafted well enough that it made it a pretty believeable unfolding story. I most definitely could see a young couple in their position using todays technology (camera, pc,etc) to try and find out something that's been haunting the girl for years.

Rather than explicitly showing you or explaining everything about what's going on, this movie relies on suspense and imagination, hinting at what's happening and leaving the rest up to your imagination.  In my opinion, that technique is far more effective in providing a creepy experience than a bloody slasher movie.  As another reviewer (James Morris) has said, movies that let you use your own imagination can often be far more scary than movies that explicitly show everything, because when you use your imagination, your mind draws on your worst fears.  This is the type of movie that may leave you nervous/scared for a while after you've finished watching it.

I particularly like the use of audio in this movie.  The use of audio is particularly effective during the creepy scenes.

3998141,5,B002VKE1K2,"""Paranormal Activity"" stands out as one of the scariest movies in the modern era of horror films. Working from the premise that there are no fresh ideas or approaches, merely new combinations of old ideas and approaches, PA combines the principal elements of such supernatural horrors as ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Ring"" with the faux documentary approach of the awful ""Blair Witch Project"". The story about a young woman repeatedly plagued by an unseen force might have been mundane if shot as a straight-forward horror story, but the eye of the camera, which serves essentially as a third character throughout, brings a verisimilitude to the proceedings that most genre offerings sorely lack. We hardly notice as the wide angle lens capturing the young couple asleep (our most vulnerable state) slowly becomes the eye of the demon itself.

Nonetheless, it is the fundamental strength of craft here that makes the film work. Note the sound design and how the filmmakers utilize basic elements like drones and room tone to create a palate of dread - or the shot composition. The director adroitly stages the shot of the bedroom and opened door, expertly placing the door, hallway and staircase (each location being one that we might anticipate movement of some sort) on the upper left, creating maximum tension and drawing our interest. Putting the clock on the lower right makes it difficult to determine where our line of site should focus.

The film is not without its flaws. The blas attitude of the boyfriend is completely unrealistic, as is the notion that the ""paranormal activity"", most notably the Ouija board scene, wouldn't send the couple screaming to the nearest church. But the fact that these incongruities fail to undercut the film speaks to the overall strength of the piece.

Lastly, PA should serve as a source of inspiration to all prospective filmmakers, for a number of reasons. First, the alternate cuts of the film - particularly a version of the ending available online - demonstrate that PA benefited from a good amount of post-production tweaking. The alternate ending is every bit as cheesy and abrupt as the theatrical ending is chilling. The vast improvement of the final cut demonstrates how liquid cinema may be - how a capable filmmaker still undergoes trial and error before nailing it. Further, young directors struggling to accumulate a budget might take note that the film cost next to nothing (11k-15k) and was shot entirely on one location with a pro-sumer camcorder. It serves as proof that a strong concept super-cedes robust production resources anytime.",1264377600,5,2592,5.065573770491803

3998154,4,B002VKE1K2,"I love watching a scary movie, even if it has me looking over my shoulder and/or conjuring shadows in a room that aren't really there.  As I've gotten older it's become more difficult for movies to scare me like they used to and though my imagination hasn't diminished, what it has become is more realistic, skeptical and analytical.  That being said, ""Paranormal Activity"" did not have me curling into a ball and peeking between my fingers with apprehension, but it did evoke a palpable sense of disquiet with its simplistic setting and a plausible approach to the supernatural that shrewdly preys on the uncertainties and persuasions of God-fearing individuals.

The film is presented as a documentary (it has no beginning or end credits) and takes the same approach that ""The Blair Witch Project"" did, director Oren Peli touting it as a true story.  He sets the stage succinctly with a young and typical cohabiting couple who have been experiencing minor but consistent paranormal activity in their home over an unspecified period of time.  They mutually decide to start documenting the goings-on via video and audio and what they capture both captivates and frightens them.  From the beginning it is made clear that this haunting is not an isolated incident - Katie (Featherston) has been followed by this entity ever since she was eight years old and her boyfriend Micah (Sloat) finds this out for the first time when a psychic makes a visit and informs both of them that the presence in their home is demonic in nature.

While Katie is naturally passive and errs on the side of caution, Micah is impetuous and begins addressing the entity directly, taunting it and even bringing a Ouija board into the home to initiate open communication (much to Katie's consternation and against the advice of the psychic).  The activity then grows from mere thumps and scrapes in the wee hours to unnerving breezes, moving objects and physical attacks.  In no time at all, Micah and Katie are frightened and cranky from sleep-deprivation, their mutual fear and anxiety causing constant dissension and feeding the entity's appetite for negative energy.

By the time this mockumentary reaches its end, you'll probably be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for a grand finale that will leave you breathless and satisfied.  What you'll more than likely get is something akin to a drunken orgasm - you know a climax occurred at some point from that shiver you just felt but for some reason you're still holding your breath waiting for the big one.

Don't get me wrong - ""Paranormal Activity"" contains a good amount of well-executed scares and though I was literally leaning forward at times, squinting at the shadows in Micah and Katie's bedroom, my heart pounding with equal amounts of anticipation and dread, I wasn't ever brought to the point where I jumped out of my skin with fright.  And don't expect to see what's responsible for the terror - much like the aforementioned ""Blair Witch"", this film forces the audience to use their imaginations in order to conjure something menacing rather than create a computerized imp that would likely incite scathing criticism and/or disappointment.  Despite its failure to scare the bejesus out of me, it still greatly played on personal fears and superstitions of mine (I wouldn't ever mess with a Ouija board - bad joojoo, people), particularly the prospect of demonic possession.  To me, nothing is scarier than losing myself to something I can't understand or control, much less see.

A first time filmmaker, Peli really broke the bank with this one.  Filmed for $15K (which overextended his intended budget of $10K) in his own home in a little over a week, ""Paranormal Activity"" raked in almost $142 million when all was said and done.  Peli's personal website, which invited users to ""demand"" the film at other venues via [...]. (it started out in only 12 theaters in September of '09), proved to be an innovative marketing tool and when the counter hit over 1 million requests, Paramount granted the film a wide domestic release.  The result?  A word-of-mouth success story.

Bottom line: I'm not inviting you to go with the hype on this one but I'm not telling you to ignore it entirely either.  ""Paranormal Activity"" generated the buzz that it did for good reason.  If you don't mind a film that will keep you up late wondering about every creak and bump you hear in your house, then by all means, go for it.  If you can't tolerate scary movies that take a realistic approach about paranormal phenomenon, you'd better take a pass on this one, lest you end up hiding like a child beneath the covers in your darkened bedroom, holding your breath and counting with trepidation the hours and minutes until dawn.",1264291200,2,4754,4.877018633540373

3998158,2,B002VKE1K2,"After getting a few responses from people about the 4 out of 5 I thought about it.  This movie was stupid.  I decided to give it a 2.  It was boring.  I mean, it did make me jump.  But oh well.  A 2 it is.

Fear is described as an unpleasant usually strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger.  You surely do feel fear when watching this movie.  It's little things that scare you.  You won't see men standing in the shadows with a knife and blood all over him.  Nor will you see monsters or creatures of the sort.  The things that happen in this movie that make you afraid are the unknown.

The movie has a very simple story.  A man and lady think something is going on in there house.  So, the man decides to set up stuff to record the sounds in there home as well as get a camera to video tape.  He even records them when they sleep.  You can see the time on the bottom of the screen.  At first they play the time by fast.  Skipping through hours in a few seconds.  Then, they stop and show it in real time.  Your heart starts racing and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Why?  Well, you wonder why they have started to play the video in normal speed.  Even if you don't hear or see anything.  It actually adds more fear not seeing stuff.  Makes you wonder when or if you will eventually.  Sometimes the lady till get out of bed and stand looking at the man in bed.  Hours go by and she just stands, watching.  Again, the not knowing what she is going to do will make you almost scream.  It's amazing how so little can do so much.  More writers should watch this movie and think about it.

The horror of the film is kind of ruined when watching it at home, while at the same time adding some fear.  You loose some because your at home.  You can turn down the TV or even fast forward through to see what will happen.  I turned down my TV.  If I had seen it in the theater I would have probably been shaking.  You add a little fear as well though.  Why?  Well, your watching it at home.  The movie is all inside the peoples house.  At home your either alone or with only a few people.  When the movie is through you will probably start looking around and jumping when you hear a creek, crack or sound.  No matter how loud or soft.

I had given this a 4 at first.  But I mean, the story is really pointless.  Anyone could have written it.  Seeing a movie that has a monster grow out of a rock and walk through your wall, while possibly being scary, isn't real.  I mean, who is going to be afraid that something like that will happen?  This movie is simple and really does seem like a home movie.  The ending is the worst part.  It totally ruins the movie.  While the movie makes you think that it could happen to you or anyone, the end just goes all sci fi  and ends like a typical horror movie.  I will not say what happens.  There is nothing extra on this movie except for alternate endings.  I mean, how much money did this movie cost to make and how much did it actually make.  Seems they could have sold it for 10 dollars and loaded it with extra stuff.  I would wait for a while before buying.  They will probably release a version of the DVD with extra stuff.  So no one says what I know they will say, I didn't base my review on the lack of extras.  I based it on what the movie made me feel.  I actually didn't like the movie at all.",1263945600,,3371,4.045731707317073
3998159,4,B002VKE1K2,"After reading the reviews on here I was not expecting to enjoy this movie.  However, it did make quite a splash theatrically so I figured it was worth a watch.  I did not buy it, but I rented it from a Redbox.  I am buying it now just to watch with people that haven't seen it yet.  It isn't really the kind of movie you watch more than once because the best part of this movie is the suspense and not knowing what is coming.  I frequently buy movies to show to other people, not to watch over and over again alone.

If you like to be scared, and you aren't so cerebral that you can't forget you are watching a movie, then you will really like this one.  I love scary movies.  I also love horror movies.  But I wouldn't really call this a horror movie (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  It is more of a scary ghost story (e.g. The Sixth Sense).  Now don't jump all over me for comparing it to The Sixth Sense.  (It's good, but not that good).  I found the acting to be quite good.  The actors did a great job of seeming spontaneous and realistic.  The camera work is not as nauseating as Cloverfield or Blair With, but if that type of film bothers you than this one might also.

This movie achieves its goal.  To scare you.  If you like the type of movie that makes you jump out of your seat than you won't be disappointed.  I'm embarassed to say this, but the night I watched it I freaked myself out so bad that I had to look under my bed and in the closet before I went to bed.  I know I'm a wimp.

I think this is the kind of movie that people either hate it or love it.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie that really scared me.  And this movie definitely did that.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys Stephen King books and those shows on A&E where they try to find real ghosts.  LOL.",1263945600,3,1809,4.056657223796034

3998161,3,B002VKE1K2,"When I first heard about this movie hitting the theaters, I admit I was kind of nervous to go after hearing how horrifying it is. And maybe if I had gone it would have been. But after hearing about it for months and hearing about the general plot, I finally convinced my bf to watch it with me (he thought it'd be lame so he didn't want to).
The idea of being stalked and posessed by a demon is creepy b/c there are actual cases out there that claim this (the exorcism of emily rose). Maybe if I knew nothing of this movie, saw it in a dark theater by myself, I would have been really freaked out. But watching it in my house just didn't do much for me.
People keep making fun Katie, but honestly if something like this was lurking around wouldn't you be a little PO'd? I'd probably be in a corner crying and speed dialing a demonologist in no time. Why she never spoke up as a kid or ever about this and just was cool with living with it is beyond fake. I understand how she'd be mad at Micah for provoking it, but why she didn't just stay with her friend, find a priest, or put the camera away and stop bugging it the minute she saw evidence of it is again, beyond me.
Micah acted like a typical cocky guy who wanted to 1) see all the cool evidence this thing exists and 2) I guess be the hero as he kind of said, and try to get rid of the thing that's stalking his gf.  Why he thought catching stuff on camera would be sure to get rid of it, or catching it's footprints would be enough evidence to what? scare it away, annoy it and make it leave? I have no idea.
I probably wouldn't watch this again but it was good at least once. It's kind of like Blair Witch except you actually see stuff. I can't even remember anything about BW it was so incredibly boring, but this movie is more interesting and I suppose could possibly happen, at least to an extent. The psychic isn't the greatest actor and is kind of dramatic and uninformative about what they should do since it's not his area of expertise. But other than that, I thought the 2 actors seemed real enough where if you didn't know this was a movie, may actually trick you into thinking it was a documentary. Overall I'd say give it a shot. For those who gave it 1 star were probably just disappointed after everyone hyped it up. for those who gave it 5 probably are freaked out by the idea that in some small way it could have been real. Or at least the idea of it. Watch it once. Don't watch it in the dark if you freak out easily, and if you're sceptical, then watch it alone in the dark and maybe you'll get something out of it.",1263859200,2,2590,4.108481262327416
3998162,5,B002VKE1K2,"Being a long time horror fan, I was enticed by the hype of the so called ""Scariest Movie of All Time"" moniker that was being thrown around in reference to ""Paranormal Activity"".  Is it correct?  Not quite, but the film still offers its own fair share of scares and thrills.  The film begins by showing the audience the basic daily lives of the two main (and basically only) actors of the film.  The audience is told that the couple has been experiencing a lot of night terrors recently, ranging from crashes and bumps, to more drastic and major events as well. To finally put an end to this, Micah decides to capture every moment of their daily lives on video.  He begins to carry around a camera in hopes of catching the haunting in action.

The audience sees Micha's and Katie's lives in real-time as events are actually occurring.  The real thrills don't begin until the night scenes however.  During the night, Micha places the camera on a tripod in the corner of the room.  During the first few nights the audience is treated to thumps, crashes, doors opening on their own, and lights flickering.  The hauntings become worse with each night and as the hours progress.  Micha begins to infuriate the spirit even further through his constant provoking actions.  This makes the audience feel tense as to how the spirit will act, especially since the events are occurring in real-time.  The angrier the spirit gets, the more violent the hauntings become, even leading to eventual day-time hauntings.  What was once simple ""bumps"" and other noises transform into violent attacks against the couple.  A simple poltergeist reveals itself as a demon.

The camera is always placed in the perfect corner of the room, allowing the audience to view footprints, shadows, and other events as they occur.  What adds to the suspense is the fact that the spirit gradually becomes worse as time goes by.  The pacing is done extremely well, building suspense with each passing night.  This contributes greatly to the overall scare factor of the film.  The last few nights of the film are filled with so much suspense and terror that the build up going into the scenes alone is enough to justify chills.  I felt as if I could actually feel the aggression of the demonic spirit with its every action.  Truly suspenseful.

Maybe I have been desensitized to horror movies, seeing how the horror genre has always been my personal favorite and having a collection of over 100 horror films, but I still cannot call it the ""Scariest Film of All Time"".  However, the film offers enough scares and suspense for me to say that it is truly remarkable and definitely worth checking out if you're looking for good scares.",1263859200,4,2693,4.754310344827586
3998193,2,B002VKE1K2,"There was certainly a lot of buzz surrounding ""Paranormal Activity"" when it finally made it to theaters back in October but it's one of those movies that seems to polarize people. Either you think it was a genius masterpiece or shoddily made piece of crap. Care to wager which end I'm on? Yeah, I know it's not much of a gamble is it?

Spoilers ahead!

The plot is fairly straightforward. A couple (Kate Featherston and Micah Sloat who play themselves) live together begin to experience paranormal activity which starts to escalate after the boyfriend purchases a professional video camera and decides to document what's going on. After some prodding and a visit from a psychic, the girlfriend admits that this is not something new to her and she has experienced this since she was a child. The psychic quickly tells the couple that they have a demon and that he isn't equipped to help them and instead gives them the business card of one of his colleagues.

Enter the standard horror movie plot. Micah is ""that guy"", (you know, don't be *that* guy) and rather than help his lover overcome the situation he suggests that she not call the demonologist and instead that they just keep filming in hopes of catching something really cool on tape. Things are getting worse gradually, strange noises, objects moving, doors slamming most of it is off camera and can be seen coming a mile away by the audience. That is until Micah barrows a Ouija board after promising Kate that he wouldn't buy one and it bursts into flames while unattended. Everything for them is down hill after this point.

I saw a lot of parallels between ""Paranormal Activity"" and the previously reviewed ""Death of a Ghost Hunter"". Most of which weren't a positive. 'Ghost Hunter got a 4 out of 10 from me and the only reason it managed to even scrape together that much of a rating was because for all of the things it did wrong (and I mean really wrong) it was at least creative and a little different from the pack. Paranormal Activity on the other hand did the same things wrong and lacked any originality or creativity that saved 'Ghost Hunter from a complete skewering. People pretending to be themselves and running around with a Sony Handicam... yeah we saw that already and it was called ""The Blair Witch Project"".

Perhaps the worst part about ""Paranormal Activity"" is that it is a lot of build up for nothing. The scary and tense scenes maybe equal an entire twelve minutes of the 86 minute feature. There's a lot of sitting around,  a lot of the couple fighting, and most notably a lot of Micah acting like a disobedient four year old. There are a few genuinely creepy scenes, my favorite of which involved the couple putting down lines of talcum powder from which powdery monster foot prints began to appear during the middle of the night, but that is the closet you'll come to actually seeing the entity. It's a lot of door banging and Katie acting crazy and rocking back and forth.

The verdict? It's been done to death and they don't even try to do it well. A flimsy plot and an entire box of un-creativity sprinkled liberally throughout earned ""Paranormal Activity"" a two and half out of ten from me.

There really isn't anything bad about this movie, it just has no substance, no suspence, no story, no music and no magic.  It really needs some Hollywood magic.

I can't understand why so many people went to the theaters to see this yawn inducing bore.  Even bad Hollywood horror movies provide gore and cheap scares, this movie gives us nothing.",1263686400,5,1188,4.3545454545454545

I thought it would be a good experience to see it on the big screen but instead it turned into a scream fest amongst teen girls which was instigated by one clown over-exaggerating his own fear.  Half the time I couldn't even hear the movie or what the characters were saying.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have waited a month or so to see this at the movie theater, hoping by then the shock of the new movie would wear off on its viewers.

All that being said, at the time I didn't really find the movie frightening. There were a couple of parts that were creepy - like the parts where Katie would be standing over Michah staring at him for hours.  Or the noises coming from the stairs. Those things were creepy but not necessarily frightening........at the time.  What I didn't expect was to not be able to sleep without the hall light on for the next month!! My bedroom is upstairs and when I got home that night after the movies and every night afterwards, I thought of the movie before going to sleep and it freaked me out.  So I guess after all the movie did what it was supposed to do.  I'm now able to sleep with the lights off, but every once in a while I still look in to the dark hallway from my bed and I think of Paranormal Activity.  Creepy!",1263600000,,1382,4.146067415730337

this film though, was unbelievably terrifying, without doing much. you never see what is terrifying them. it makes your imagination wander into horrifying realms , and that's what is truly scary. i also disagree with the person who said the alternate ending wasn't up to par. when i saw it i couldn't decide which ending i liked better, which is so rare with these types of films. if i was directing this film i would have had a tough time deciding which one to use. they were both just as fantastic in completely different ways....as u can probably tell  i recommend this movie wholeheartedly...see it , it's definitely worth your time.",1263427200,,2059,4.713888888888889

Yea, yea, people who wrote 5 star recommendations would defend by saying ""use your imagination.  Imagine if you are in these situations etc.."", or I don't have enough intelligence or mind to get myself scared.  Sorry.  I REALLY tried to get into this one.

So I watched this thing.  Started watching at 1AM, sitting front of my 60inch plasma with all the lights out, listening through a high end Sennheiser headphone(HD 600) to immerse into the movie even more, alone while rest of my family were sleeping.

This is one of the most boring, pathetic, time waster of a movie I have seen in a long, long time!  It's worse than the Blair Witch!

The alternate ending is even worse!**spoiler alert**

I came in a bit optimistic - I heard the same things about the Blair Witch Project and left that one disappointed. I felt this one played much better, was more interesting and even a bit freaky!

Watching this movie can truly be scary! It's the lack of seeing anything that makes it so much worse. The acting was nice, the pace was good and there were some things I hadn't seen before. Not terrifying, but scary in the ""What's going to happen?!"" sense. Like the Blair Witch, I felt that when it finally got really ""good"", it ended. I left saying ""What? That's it?!"" and a bit disappointed. It was fun, but a little lackluster in the end.

The Blu-Ray itself was also disappointing - don't expect Cloverfield out of this. The quality is better than the DVD, but for a very low budget movie, it shows (maybe that's to make it more ""real""?). Not as bad as 28 days later, but not a whole lot better (and it likely won't get any better). More disappointing than the quality were the extras - an alternate ending and a digital copy! No commentary, behind the scenes.. nothing. I expect this to be released in a ""deluxe"" version not too far down the line.

Also disappointing were the ""Get your name in the credits"" promo they ran. Register your name on a website, appear as a ""special thanks"" on the DVD/Blu-Ray. Sounds great! Seems they got about 500,000 names and decided to run them in super-fast motion (several hundred per second, running for about 15 minutes). Expect to ""slow mo"" to find your name. If you were looking forward to this (and considered it a selling point on the set, you'll be disappointed).

  1: you pretty much saw all of the scariest parts in the commercial. The part in the commercial where the guy is thrown into the camera? Best damn scene in the whole movie. I would have been shocked by it had I not already scene it a million times.
  2: Every single character seems absolutely shallow and pointless. At points you're like ""okay she's possessed so she's being a total B*tch and that makes sense. But then you have parts where they flip out, then go back to the way they were... It's so fake. And the medium they bring over? Everything he says is common sense. He walks into the bedroom: ""this is where the most stuff happens isn't it?"" Oh really? Maybe because THE TRIPOD AND MIKE ARE STANDING RIGHT THERE! And everything else he says is something he picked up from talking to them... He is complete bs.

3998304,1,B002VKE1K2,"Oren Peli's 2007 debut film falls prey to the William Castle idea of a gimmick film to lure people in. Well, I was lured in, well, more like I stumbled in out of boredom and barely existent interest, but I had nothing better to do, so why not see what the big deal was about.

Running at 80 some minutes only about 15 minutes, if that, consists of the ""paranormal activity"", the rest is spent with two genuinely horrid actors doing their cringe inducing ""best"" to come off as a real couple, as real people, but they're more like caricatures than anything else, really.

As for the scary bits, they simply didn't scare me once; some things were sort of cool from a technical ""ooo, how'd they do that"" perspective, but the point of the film was to frighten me, not slowly put me into a coma occasionally checking the run time to see if it was almost over.

Films that rely on build up are hit or miss; the hits, films like Audition and Straw Dogs, work phenomenally with atmosphere and tension, the misses, like Paranormal Activity and the Blair Witch Project, don't work at all because there is no atmosphere, no sense of anything really, and when you're supposed to be frightened of a demon dragging you out of your bed that's not a good thing.

3998306,5,B002VKE1K2,"In today's horror movie genre, most of the films rely on blood and guts to scare the viewer.  Not so with ""Paranormal Activity"".  This movie relies on psychological, unseen terror to frighten the viewer, and the movie succeeds very well at this.

As for the story, couple Katie and Micah have recently moved in together.  However, there's one little secret Katie forgot to tell him; she's being haunted by an unseen demonic force that gives her terrible nightmares...and worse. During the approximate three-week time period covered in the movie, the presence constantly harasses the couple.  At first, the occurrences are minor, but as the movie goes on, they become much more frightening.  Soon, doors begin slamming for no reason, lights start flickering on and off, and Katie is pulled out of the bed.  The couple enlists the help psychologists trained in hauntings and demonology, but their efforts fail to solve the problem.  As the movie reaches its climax, Katie and Micah face the full fury of the spirit.  Who will win?

Following in the footsteps of such movies as ""The Blair With Project"" and ""Cloverfield"", ""Paranormal Activity"" scares its viewers with unseen psychological forces.  I was somewhat skeptical about how good this movie would be, but after watching it, I was truly scared.  I thought the producers did an excellent job of building the level of terror as the movie progressed.  The ending of the movie is truly frightening.  I do like horror movies with blood and guts, by the psychological terror found in ""Paranormal Activity"" is truly frightening.

I guess we live in an age where ""something"" needs to happen all the time in a movie or else it's considered boring.  I'm sure those who think so would also find most black and white movies boring too.  If you really want to enjoy this one, it's not just about purchasing a ticket but being willing to go on the ride.  The ending is frightening exactly because the first part of the movie is so ""normal life"".  They lull you into a sense of the common place and show a real relationship.  After finding out what happens to this couple, it is even more disturbing the second time around to see the impending doom that neither can contemplate.

I seriously worried about America, judging from those people who gave 3 or more stars for this crappy movie. These people must have not watched movies at all in their entire life, and so got so caught up about this movie. If these people think this movie is chilling, haunting, scary, then I seriously seriously worried how these people live their lives, how they view things, people, make decisions.

However, in movie form it is pretty dull. 90% of the time these people are just talking about how scared they are or how to fix the problem. When the action is taking place it is well done.

3998331,3,B002VKE1K2,"Ordinary young couple Katie and Micah have been experiencing some interesting phenomena.  Out of a sense of playfulness--for he doesn't really believe in ghosts--Micah buys a video camera and decides to film the events.  Thus, this film.

The technique behind PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is one that I have always found intriguing--surely the most interesting way to film a horror movie.  CLOVERFIELD utilized it effectively; QUARANTINE, not so much.  Never saw BLAIR WITCH, though I probably will if I find it for an outrageously low price.  My point is, ACTIVITY looks and feels real, which is far more than most horror movies coming out these days.  Its premise is its strongest suit: no real explanation (in fact, what little explanation there is was extraneous and weighed the film down); no real horrors actually seen, at least until the end (and oh, what a final scene; the very last image is a bit cliched, but the minute or two leading up to it...phenomenal); no overarching goals or ambitions or social commentary.  It's just a simple little horror novel about ordinary people finding themselves in an extraordinary situation.

I have the feeling, if you didn't see it in theaters, you missed out.  I know a bunch of people who saw it at the cinema and were thoroughly disturbed; after all, a group of people gets frightened far more than a single person (fear being contagious).  Having watched it alone in my apartment (at night, at least), I was entertained, if not overly frightened.  Nor was I really disturbed, and that is why I gave the film only three stars.  The performances are strong (this doesn't come across as ""acting,"" and it shouldn't), the script is engaging and realistic, and the sound effects are absolutely creepy.  But the film never really lingers.  Sure, the ending is great--in fact, that may have contributed to the enthusiastic response.  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a ho-hum movie with a truly great premise and a fantastic ending (even the alternate ending is okay; not as good as the one used, but disturbing nonetheless).  It's worth a viewing to fans of the genre; and, over time, will surely gain a cult status that it probably deserves.",1262476800,2,2168,4.912087912087912

3998344,2,B002VKE1K2,"Ok, unless you live in Siberia or something, you all know the story, a young couple Katie and Micah seem to be visited, mostly at night, by a ghost or demon in their new home and Micah takes matters into his own hands by videotaping and recording every single moment, literally. This is it in a nutshell, ""Night 1"", they toss and turn, a slight noise, next day Katie whines and Micah checks it out on his computer, tapes Katie in the bathroom. ""Night 3"", toss and turn, bedroom door moves back and forth, next day Katie whines some more about being scared, Micah gets into it, tapes her some more in the bathroom. ""Night 6"" toss and turning, loud thump, Katie calls a psychic and he stops by and does nothing, and so on and so forth. LOL! Sorry, that may not be exactly it but...I will admit that I did enjoy the very end, you can skip the alternate ending, but up until that point I just didn't believe any of it or the characters. It's a shame because I really was looking forward to it.

I'd like to congratulate the marketing folks who did an amazing job with this film, creating all kinds of buzz and hype and sucking almost everyone in the world to go see this film and/or buy the DVD. I must say I am the latter and boy was I duped! I have to say maybe I'm just a ""doubting Thomas"" but I don't go for all the ""ghost hunter"" tv reality shows and the like and when I heard the premise of this I just couldn't pull myself to go to the theater and see it. In any event I kept reading, not in great detail as to spoil any expectations, review after review praising and saying how scary this was, much to my dismay.

One reviewer said, "" Paranormal Activity is the most raw horror film since the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It's very realistic and unsettling."" But then in the same breath goes on to say ""The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the stupid characters"", how can you have a movie that is both realistic and has stupid characters? You got me, I thought the characters were very unrealistic most notably, which no one seems to mention, the visiting ""psychic"" played by Mark Fredrichs. His dialogue was horrible and stiff and was so completely bad that it shot was credibility it had right out the window. At some points Micah was pretty unbelievable too when he is yelling out to the spirit, and the whole cliche using the Ouija Board was almost laughable. On top of all this as the story unfolds, I won't give it away, but it just became more increasingly lame, ie the story on the computer and the past. Come on, you tell me you really got into that?

Anyway, I could really go on and on but I won't. Like I said from the start, maybe I'm too much of a ""doubting Thomas"" or just don't jump on the ""bandwagon"" like most, I don't know, I do know this was NOT the most scariest movie ever nor should it be compared to some of the great classics! And I slept like a baby that night. Oh, I almost forgot, I did get my name in the credits! LOL! I wish I hadn't now that I know how bad it was. I've also put my copy up for sale on Amazon.

I even participated in the Demand It promotion on the movie's website because in the beginning it wasn't showing in El Paso but it started showing in the city rather quickly but then I started reading the reviews on Yahoo movies and quickly changed my mind.  I told myself that I rather wait until it came out on DVD because I knew based on the ratings it wouldn't stay in the theaters that long and let me TELL YOU...I'm so glad that I went with my gut feeling!  The DVD wasn't completely terrible but it wasn't that great.  I know the movie was made with about $12,000 but I thought it would at least be somewhat scary!  The last 15 minutes was the scariest.  I'm thinking that was the part that was shown in the previews!  I'm so glad that I didn't waste my money and believe the hype!  This movie was definitely over marketed and the consumers were robbed while the studio is laughing all the way to the bank!

The movie could have been done in less than 30 minutes.  There are no special features on the DVD.  I'm giving it 3 stars for effort but seriously it doesn't even really deserve that!  How are these people on Amazon giving this movie 5 stars?  I also didn't understand how the movie got beyond a C- rating on Yahoo.

3998346,3,B002VKE1K2,"A warning first: If you intend to watch this film unspoiled, hopefully, you have not seen the trailer; nor should you. My Paranormal Activity experience was ruined because(and I am not exaggerating) 90% of the scares were in the trailer. Basically, if you have seen the trailer, you've seen the film.

Is it spooky? A tad. Is it original: Not really. Is it overhyped? Yep.

If you scare easily, you may enjoy this (or not, depending on if you don't like to BE scared). Most people go to see films like this to get an adrenaline rush. Again, if you have seen the trailer, the fun is pretty much ruined. Even the big 'climactic' ending is spoiled (shown in the trailer) so you expect it.

I applaud the film for doing so well on a ridiculously unheard of budget. It certainly is better than most other so-called horror films out there now. It feels more realistic, especially with the two main characters doing a pretty good job of acting genuinely scared. However, there are parts in the film that felt set up and unauthentic. For example, if your girlfriend was screaming her head off in another part of the house, would you take the time to grab your video camera first, or would you just go running after her? It's just little moments like that which sort of spoiled some of the excitement for me.

Also, the original ending is WAY better than the theatrical one. It feels more realistic, while the theatrical ending feels, well, Hollywoodized (not a word, but well, I think everyone knows what I mean...)",1262476800,4,1507,4.591078066914498

I also found myself getting irritated at stupidly written characters who steadfastly refused to do anything about their deteriorating circumstances. Ok, Mr. Take Charge Wannabe Tough Boyfriend,  why didn't you do anything for your girlfriend day upon day upon day?  She wanders outside, spends the night on the porch, and freezes herself out.

There is almost nothing extra on this DVD besides a weak alternate ending and a preview for Shutter Island.
Otherwise, however, this is an updated, higher tech version of The Blair Witch Project, but with much more intimacy, since it takes place entirely inside a nice house in San Diego, on a quiet suburban street that seems very tranquil.  Micah and Katie are beset by noises, moving objects, lights going on and off, and, as we eventually discover, a demonic presence which has been after Katie since she was a young child.  Her BF Micah, for the most part, is more interested in his camera work than in the dangerous situation that she is in...until it is too late.
He makes a terrible mistake in bringing in the Ouija board, and I still think calling an exorcist might have helped this unfortunate couple.
The strength of the movie lies in the fact that it does not depend on blood and gore for effect; instead, it works on the viewer's psyche and makes the imagination run wild. What we don't see is always more frightening because our worst fears run away with us.",1262304000,2,1110,4.682051282051282

There are no special effects, but far worse, there is not much of a script. Yet again, movie moguls have figured out a way to rip us off. They hyped this crap and laughed all the way to bank.

3998378,4,B002VKE1K2,"For an alleged $15,000, filmmaker Oren Peli has taken the concept of a horror film using ""found footage"" and managed to succeed where the Blair Witch Project failed miserably.

The movie focuses on an engaged couple, Micah and Katie, as they try to get to the bottom of the weird noises and events that Katie has been experiencing since a house fire when she was a kid.  Micah documents their house over a series of days using his high definition video camera.  As the events get stranger, Katie gets more and more concerned that Micah is angering whatever is behind these strange occurrences.

Peli does a great job of amping up the tension, but can't deliver a payoff comparable to what led up to it.  But the movie itself is excellent for what it is.

I never saw it in theaters and took in all the reviews and opinions over the past few months. I love horror movies, so I knew I would see it at some point, but I was careful not to believe all the hype, and took a more ""wait and see"" kind of approach. I just got the blu-ray version of this film for Christmas and watched it a little while ago, my first horror movie for the new year. Honestly, it was thoroughly entertaining and creepy throughout the movie, the best and scariest part being the last few minutes of the film. I also watched the alternate ending. I guess if I had to decide which ending I liked better, I would have to go with the theatrical version, but the alternate was very eerie as well. I do not feel as those who find themselves unable to sleep for weeks after seeing this film, but I can see myself looking over my shoulder at times. I am 51 years old, and have loved horror films since I was a young boy. But, putting it in perspective, I remember freaking out watching an episode the Twilight Zone back in the 60s and being unable to sleep that night. I think the younger crowd, for the most part, would be most frightened by ""Paranormal Activity"" and us older folks are more frightened by day-to-day events in the world than by a movie. Suffice it to say, I thought it was worth watching and should give you a few jolts, probably many more jolts if you are younger. Some people told me it was boring, which I did not find. It kept my attention from start to finish. The blu-ray transfer seemed fine, given the way it was filmed. I have no complaints in that department.

This movie is just like its predecessors - The Blair Witch Project, Open Water, The Descent, and Wolf Creek to name a few - in claiming to be a movie ""so scary you will crap yourself then be traumatized for life afterward."" All of these movies claimed the same thing and were all terrible, boring films with little to no scares. I have had enough already, and I cannot fathom how any finds this or any of the aforementioned titles to be the least bit scary. Unless you find suddenly slamming doors, random grunts, and loud crashes out of no where to be scary. This movie is about as frightening as Milo & Otis.

The Age of Innocence moves faster than this movie. There is no real build up, and is just generally boring throughout. Nothing happens until about the last minute of the movie but it is a moot point by then because the rest of the movie was so utterly slow and pointless. I don't watch these movies so that I can watch people argue in docu-drama style, that is about all that seems to happen.

This is a typical horror movie filmed in documentary style and they all follow the same mundane formula. Boring dialog that escalates into arguments with a few minor scares usually in the form of random noises by unseen things. The whole experience in the end is big let down and I can't understand how moviegoers and critics alike still praise this awful form of film making. Or how people continue to find this crap scary, I will just never understand it. The scariest part of watching this movie was my fiance's sudden loud snore when you feel asleep without my knowledge!

I am steering clear from anymore of these "" scariest movie of all time"" claims from here on out. I am big fan of the horror genre and how looking for something that will give me a good scare. I don't scare easily and have been a big horror fan all my life which is maybe why I never find the alleged scare claims to be true. To each his own I guess but if you are going to make such big boasts for god sakes please deliver for once and stop wasting my time and money.

One of the taglines for this movie was ""What happens when you sleep?"" If you want find out, pop this movie in and you will be asleep in no time.",1262217600,23,2392,4.3467561521252795
3998382,4,B002VKE1K2,"As a Christian who has seen this film I already know that there is a spiritual world out there. A 3rd of Satan's angles turned demons were cast down from heaven. I also don't believe the psychic's mombo jumbo that 'ghosts are not demons'. Ghosts are demons. You see when you die you go to heaven or hell. No one stays on Earth. So when people are contacting 'their grandmother' it's really a demon. Your grandmother went to heaven or hell. Demons who are ghosts roam the Earth seeking who they can devour with Satan's help. This movie shows the stupidity of people who are not Christian, do not believe in Jesus, and do not know what they are messing with open the door for possession and evil. I do believe that Katie has been followed from her life because demons can pick who they want to harass, and devour themselves. Her boyfriend Micha was dumb as can be and antagonized it and believed he could conquer it. The film definitely felt real and gave you a ""Blair Witch feel"". Even though it wasn't true there is a spiritual world out there and if you don't know Jesus Christ or the Devil and his minions you are opening a door that cannot be shut.",1262217600,2,1151,4.383177570093458

3998415,4,B002VKE1K2,"I had high hopes for this movie and I wasn't disappointed. It delivered in the creepy night vision camera look similar to ghost hunters and other paranormal tv shows. The story was slow to build but started rather quickly with the purchase of the camera to ""catch"" the paranormal activity. We don't get to see why he needed to buy the camera in the first place. So that was kind of weird.

Once the story got going, it was truly creepy with a couple of ""whoa"" moments. The alternate ending on the disc was interesting. The one thing I have to give props to in this movie is the lead actress` ability to hurl a blood curdling scream. Lord have mercy can that girl lay down a scream track. Believable to the core.

overall a must see movie and then you can judge for yourself if it's a keep or delete. I rented it and watched it. I doubt i'll buy the blu-ray until it's under $10 down the line.

3998418,2,B002VKE1K2,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because of the actors performance.  They were believable..up until near the end when the young gal's acting took a nose dive right where she needed to be the most believable.  She really bombed out in the scene where the psychic comes back and they're at the front door.  She bottomed out there and thereafter.  Prior to that she was great.  It's like she knew how important that scene and the few next ones were to the story and somehow let her nervousness overcome her...I could totally tell she was 'over-acting' at that point.  The guy, on the other hand, was totally laughable.  His performance was good, it was his behavior that was so funny it totally removed any kind of scariness to the flick for me.  He behaves like an immature kid in a young man's body (but then again, don't all men his age act that way? LOL..just kidding).  They are adorably cute people/actors, both of them, and it would be nice to see them in better movies.

The plot itself I'm already so familiar with because I've already dealt with living in a haunted house where doors open and close on their own and other phenomena happened.  I've done  camcording myself (not quite to the extreme as this movie though) of the paranormal phenomena that occurred and have videos of the doors doing their thing on their own, evps, photos, etc and living in that environment, for me anyway, wasn't scary.  So I really wasn't expecting this movie to be all that scary to me to begin with, and I was right, it isn't.

The director bombed out in a couple scenes as well....he made some things too obvious.  He failed to edit out the dark round ceiling vent that blew the air onto the young gal when she was standing in the upstairs hall claiming she could feel the 'demon' breathing on her while her hair was getting softly blown around.  Another scene he blew it on was when the sheets were being moved by puffs of air, and then shortly after the actors sit down on the bed, with the guy making it a point to sit right where the sheets were moved.  That act (him sitting in that spot) didn't make the sheet movement believable, it only served to bring attention to the fakeness of it.  Also, the director *totally* blew the believability of the entire flick by the interior house setting.  Everything inside the house was too perfect.  Perfectly decorated with perfectly brand new furniture and appliances sitting in perfectly (and freshly) painted rooms.....come on..like how many average people actually live like that??  None that I know! lol

I wouldn't even begin to compare this flick with an Alfred Hitchcock movie, that would be a total insult to Hitchcock's legacy...Hitchcock was a horror Master, the director of this flick is nowhere near that, he's not just not even in the same ballpark, he's in a totally different twilight zone.",1262217600,3,2864,4.607495069033531
3998419,5,B002VKE1K2,"I saw this movie in the theater with a friend of mine. I'm the type of person that watches a movie for what it is, without any expectations. My friend, however, was bred on the gore flicks of the last few years, so she expects blood, gore, and millions of dollars worth of special effects to make a movie scary. So her expectations were for a high dollar Hollywood creation, while I went into the theater, sat down, and let the movie come; special effects or not. I found the movie scary, she did not.

There lies the problem. If you're expecting all this cgi and manufacturing, you'll be disappointed at a great movie. My advice to you: Watch the movie with NO expectations. Just watch it, and get into what's going on. It helps if you've experienced a haunting yourself to make this movie scarier.

And as the ""affected"" person of the pair, why then wouldn't anyone, male or female, change places and sleep on the ""safe"" side of the bed??

3998421,5,B002VKE1K2,"Horror has become a very diluted genre these days. And as far as quality goes, a very poor one. So if you thought Saw XXII and Friday the 13th remake were actually good movies, leave this review now because I will insult you greatly. Anyway I jumped at the chance to drive an hour to see this little film on limited release and I LOVED it. It is a good film. Let me say that again to all the one star reviewers, it IS a good film. But I will admit it is different from what all the kiddies consider horror these days. There are no sorority cheerleaders killed in the opening 5 minutes, there is no (onscreen) sex. The movie starts slow to build the suspense, something that most filmmakers forget they have to do, but believe me it kicks into gear.

This film leaves many questions unanswered, but contrary to the title it is not a film about a ""ghost"". It is a film about a couple who is being haunted. The director and actors do a very good job trying to make you care about Kate and Micah (the couple) so that the final act hits you like a ton of bricks. Wait, caring about characters in a horror movie? What witchcraft is this? That being said of course this movie isn't perfect, but with a budget of $15,000 this movie succeeded in doing something that $30 million dollar movies couldn't. Truly scare me.

If you're tired with studios remaking every movie known to man..get this movie.

(On a DVD side of things this thing is pretty bare bones and unfortunately only includes 2 of the 3 endings to the film, neglecting to include the early original release ending. But it does it's job, just wish we could have gotten some special features...)",1262217600,4,1648,4.379084967320262
3998422,3,B002VKE1K2,"I finally got around to watching the Paranormal Activity Blu tonight.

First off, the disc has no extras, zero menus, zilch.  You get two options, Theatrical cut and unrated cut.  The unrated cut is basically just the work print with remastered sound.

Very disappointing.  During interviews some of the people involved in the film revealed that there were a handful of endings shot for the film, why weren't those included?  On top of that I'd really have loved to see a commentary and maybe a featurette on the marketing of this film, how it went from sitting on the shelf to number one at the box office.

The film itself is enjoyable.  It's a little slow and a tad predictable, but I found it to be fun the second time around, it's certainly a film in the vein of the Blair Witch Project...Low budget, raw, and an invisible antagonist.  I will admit it does get a little slow in the middle, tedious even, but if you get scared easily or you have an active imagination it will be a very enjoyable experience.

The picture quality isn't going to be the best obviously, the sound is a little muffled also...But that's how it was shot.

With the lack of features and the quality of the film I wouldn't suggest buying it on the Blu format unless you can find it cheap.",1262217600,4,1267,4.465217391304348
3998423,1,B002VKE1K2,"Nothing happens in the first hour and when (scary?) stuff does happen it's not that scary.

3998434,3,B002VKE1K2,"I saw this in the wonderful Moolah Theatre in beautiful downtown St. Louis, MO. To start with, the awesome speaker system there did nothing for the terrible sound quality of the movie. They may have wanted it to sound more like the filming was being done by a camcorder, but gritty muffling throughout did nothing but detract from the entire experience.

Another reviewer alluded to this movie as having the type of appeal that would attract eight-year-olds or those with eight-year-old intelligence levels (using much more degrading words, of course.) I wouldn't necessarily agree with that notion. On the contrary, the eight-year-olds and teenagers were the ones who were LAUGHING in the theater. NOBODY screamed until the last ten seconds.

The bore factor here was incredible. Time crawled by while two shallow characters, Micah and what's-her-name, dealt with a supernatural entity that was never seen. Hey, it's okay to not show the demon; I understand that that's supposed to be part of the fear factor, but saving the best part of the movie for the extreme end when it could have been introduced as a foundation early on and then built upon for additional scares was a HUGE golden opportunity missed by everyone involved. But that's not all as far as missed opportunities go...the whole thing with the psychic, or whatever that character was supposed to be, was flawed and underdeveloped. That individual situation could have been expanded upon to create a whole different angle and level to the movie.

So why all the hype, you ask? I have two theories. It may be one or the other, but its most likely a combination of both:

1. Exceptional marketing, whether deceiving or not! 'Nuff said.
2. When horror is presented in such a way that it is less about the grandiose, over-the-top, literally unbelievable, Hollywood presentation like ""Poltergeist,"" for instance, and more about something that is so subtle that it could actually happen to ""YOU,"" it opens the door for personal fears to creep through and subject the subconscious to a taste of a not-impossible reality.

That being said, I give the movie and its makers three stars for effort, but keep in mind viewers, MOST of this movie is VERY boring.

The only reason I watched this was because of all the hype -- and that's all this thing is; pure hype.

You know that part in the trailer where they show everyone in the audience jumping out of their seats?  Yeah, that's the last 3 seconds of the film...the rest of the film is a snore.

Has anyone ever sent you one of those pictures where they tell you to look closely for something in the background or follow a maze, then suddenly the creepy face pops up and it screams at you?

I will say however, that seeing this in a packed pre-wide release theater with a bunch of like minded individuals was one of my most memorable movie going experiences of all time.  I really doubt that someone seeing it at home for the first time could feel the same way, but with a good surround sound setup and the right group of friends, it might just work.

I'm here to review the extras that are available on the home release.  Which is to say, I'm here to review nothing.  The only extra that you're getting if you've already seen this flick is an alternate ending.  Don't get me wrong it's an AWESOME alternate ending, and since it wasn't completely ruined in the films trailer/tv commercials like the theatrical ending was, I suggest watching the version with the new ending if this is your first time.  But that's it.  There is no commentary, no deleted scenes, no featurettes, no trailers, no discussion of the winding road to release that this film took (it had Spielberg bringing it back to Dreamworks in a plastic garbage bag because he thought it was possesed), nada.

There's a collectors version of the film that you can get on DVD (not blu-ray for some reason) but the only change from the other version is that you get a TV shirt and a movie cell.

When I heard all of the buzz about this movie, I couldn't wait to rent it. Alls I heard is that this is the scariest movie ever made, and how I'd be scared out of my wits watching it.  This wasn't even close.  I had a lot of problems with it.

The first problem that I had was the sound quality. I understand they wanted to film it as if it was being filmed on a handheld (although it was a good sized one) camera.  Unfortunately, that's how it sounded too.  At times, the sound was low and not very clear. Again, I understand why it was filmed that way, but for me it didn't work. Actually, it took away from the movie.

The characters of Katie and MIcha were very shallow, and after a while, really grated on my nerves.  They were so flat and didn't have  any depth to them. There was glimmers of depth do Katie, and at times I felt sorry for her, but other times, she was kind of annoying. There wasn't really and progression of any kind to them. Micha was so boring there was nothing to him. At times, Katie grew mad at Micha, and launched a few f-bombs, but then went back to her normal self. I'd have liked to see her get a bit madder as the movie went on. If Katie went from calm to getting angry, then flat out P*issed, would have been interesting to see.  This only happened when the demon possessed her at the end. I felt that was when she was most interesting to watch.

This is  very boring movie. Nothing really happens until the last two minutes. That's why I gave it one star instead of zero stars. I actually liked the last couple of minutes. Up until then, **nothing** happens.  Sure, you get a growl, a door will move a bit, a chandelier will shake, keys will be moved, other small things happen, but that's it.  We're talking about a demon here. A demon. Why not push one of them down the steps? Throw one across the room? Have chairs being thrown about? Anything would have been good. I was just waiting for something to happen, and alls we see for a while, a door will move. That's it folks. As the movies goes on, we do seem some interesting things. A door slams, and then knocking, the girl is dragged out of bed and across the floor and then out of the room down the hall, and it possessed Katie. I actually liked that part, and that was at the end. I loved that! The movie should have started off like that, or have that happen sooner.

The movie had a Medium, who was very annoying. He said there was a demon in the house.....and this was based on feelings. Not solid evidence, no investigation, nothing, Just a feeling. They could have used the medium and have him do an overnight investigation and have him find something..... anything. But no, he said there was a demon in the house, just on his feelings. The producers and writers missed a golden chance to have fear interjected in the movie.

The attic scene bothered me. Again, they could have had something happen when Micha went to the attic. Have something fall, have Micha hear something, or have him see just a pair of eyes looking back at him, but the only thing he finds is a picture. That's it. Again, this was a fantastic scene if they movie makers wanted something scary to happen, but nothing was done, just a pic was found.

I did like the very end. When we see Katie stumble out of the room, and go into the downstairs, then we hear blood curdling screams, them Micha wakes up and runs to her and he started screaming (we don't see why, and that really worked for me, loved the scene) then silence..... then we hear heavy footsteps, Micha is thrown into the bedroom, then Kaite stomps slowly in the room covered with blood. Katie then stomps to Micha's body....crawls.... sniffs it, then grins in the camera, and growls, has a horrible demonic grin, and attacks the camera, then it ends. I loved that part!!  That was spooky, eerie, and uncomfortable to watch. I love it! Why couldn't the entire movie be like that?  I would have loved it if the entire movie was as good as that once scene. It's just to bad, that it took sitting through a boring movie to get to that last scene. I also liked how we saw the footprints in the flour, very nice.

I understand why the movie makers never showed us the demon. They figure the unseen is worse then the seen, and I agree with that. I loved the Blair Witch Project.  For some reason, in Paranormal Activity, it didn't work. Maybe if they made it more suspenseful by having the demon do more demonic things, it would have worked better than it did.

If you want to see it, I'd say go for it. Just don't expect much to happen until the last two minutes.  This movie was way overhyped.",1262131200,23,4647,4.303899082568807
3998441,1,B002VKE1K2,"I can see how a movie like this can become popular in today's (American) society, where a high percentage of movie-paying teens have the mental compacity of an eight-year-old (anyone who takes even a little time to read about the current state of education in this country and how mentally stumped teenagers are today compared to teens from only twenty years ago will back me up). Eight-year-olds are easy to scare, so, by extension, today's teens would be, too. As for the rest of us who sat through this dreck, it was an insult to our intelligence. I found myself laughing at things that weren't intentionally funny. But what made me laugh even more was knowing that so many teenagers and young adults (at least the ones who actually stopped long enough from texting to watch the movie) were actually scared by this superficial tripe. That was the real entertainment.",1262131200,4,869,4.8
3998442,1,B002VKE1K2,"I had seen Roger Ebert review this film and he gave it high marks, so I decided to keep an eye out for it's DVD release. I am always interested in seeing what creative people can do with a small budget and good ideas. Movies like ""El Mariachi"" and ""Primer"" were inspirational in their ambition and execution, so I hoped to be inspired, if not entertained. Sadly, this movie failed on both counts. There are a couple moments of chills, but they are poorly set up and quickly forgotten. The camera is set up to film the bedroom while the characters sleep, but the tape fast forwards to the point where there is a bump in the night, at which point the characters may or may not awaken to investigate, then it's the next day and they seem largely unaffected by the supernatural events. The tension isn't allowed to build, and is over much too quickly. Since there is no real sense of peril to the actors until near the end, the movie fails to create fear or empathy with the audience. Hitchcock filmed ""Rope"" and ""Rear Window"" in what was essentially one room with a view and succeeded in creating tension, providing a backstory, and memorable characters. This movie failed to sustain any energy as events are just plopped in your lap, then it's morning and time for some inane conversation before the next ""chilling moment"". The backstory could be jotted down on a cocktail napkin with room left over for a few phone numbers, and the characters are disposable. After reading all of the one star reviews, I opted to rent rather than buy, so thankfully, if I return the movie in the morning, it will only have cost me $1.99 to discover that I'm not thrilled by slamming doors and footsteps. The guy at the video store said that his daughter slept with her lights on after watching PA. Since I'm neither a drama queen or 4 year old girl I will sleep like a baby sans illumination. A guy walked up and said he had just returned his copy and it was a really good movie and it's also a true story, so I guess if I could have convinced myself that it was a documentary, it really would've been freaky. I'm sure that some people truly were shaken up by this movie, heck, I know people who lock their car doors at intersections, and to you I say ""Congratulations, I'm glad you enjoyed it more than I did, and there are hundreds of movies out there that are going to scare the bejesus out of you."" I just wish I could find a few that could make a lasting impression without resorting to a comical amount of blood and bad dialog. This review is geared more towards someone with a higher threshold for horror. I also rented ""Mirrors"" and it honestly was more exciting before the opening credits than PA in it's entireity, not that it was great, but it had atmosphere and nice visuals. Watching the two movies back to back was like comparing the stick figure flip book that I drew in the margins of my calculus book to ""Citizen Kane"". I realize that PA didn't have much of a budget and it's not a fair comparison, I'm just saying that before you plunk down your hard earned cash, there are much better choices. Rather than waste 90 minutes watching this movie, you should have a friend hold a flashlight under their chin and tell you a ghost story, then use the time you saved to watch ""Stir of Echoes"" instead.",1262131200,20,3295,4.421052631578948
3998443,5,B002VKE1K2,"Though it doesn't quite live up to the spectacular degree of hype that was built around it, Paranormal Activity is regardless a truly frightening film that delivers the goods.  Created and directed by newcomer Oren Peli, Paranormal Activity gives viewers the bird's eye view (or in this case that of a handheld camera) into the supernatural happenings in the home of a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) who are being terrorized by a destructive, demonic spirit.  At first, the only activity is a moving door or moved car keys, but it isn't long before things escalate on a very dangerous scale.  There are definite ""jump"" moments to be had, but as the film reaches its closing stretch, the events become truly terrifying, and it's made all the more so thanks to Peli's POV-style presentation.  True, the whole POV thing has been done to death since The Blair Witch Project and everything to come after it, but here, it actually feels kind of fresh to a degree.  The fact that so many fans demanded the release of the film become more widespread (so much so that it even toppled the latest installment of the Saw franchise) is a testament as to how one can do a lot with a little, and the film as a whole is also a testament that one does not need to rely on buckets of blood, guts, and torture to truly get under an audience's skin.  All in all, Paranormal Activity is one of the most truly frightening horror films to hit mainstream America in a long time, and while the best environment for viewing it is in a movie theater, catching it on home video will give you the same effect regardless.",1262044800,2,1609,4.550173010380623
3998464,1,B002VKE1K2,"My husband and I could not wait to see this movie.  Too bad it was terrible.  We had high hopes, someone was a genius with the advertising.  Not so much with the film itself.  What a waste!  The only excitement was the anticipation and thinking ""somethings going to happen....""  but nothing ever did.  What a let down.  The worst part was the ending.  LAME!
Bottom line, if your an adult with good taste for classic horror flicks that scare the total crap out of you, don't waste your time.  If you're a teenage girl having a sleep over, this might be fun.  The only reason it's rated R is because the F-bomb is dropped a bunch of times.  So other than a 4 letter word every teenager has heard, there is no reason to not let them watch based on the rating.",1262044800,5,756,4.246478873239437
3998465,2,B002VKE1K2,"I just got back from a friend's house after viewing their copy of this ""Blair Witch Project"" wannabe.  I actually laughed at this movie instead of being frightened or scared by it.  The hand held camera was done first in the BWP and enough already.  It doesn't make the movie any better to watch when you see the floor with a quick movement to the ceiling then back to the floor again.  Stop it already.  The movie picked up at the end but let's face it, it had to do something to save it if possible.  Only the last 10 minutes really does anything but I was left with a feeling of having my time wasted by this whole thing.  The attempt to make you think that this really happened with the credits, sorry, what credits? just a blank screen after having the female lead's whereabouts unknown.  Just feeling jipped.  No major extras for the dvd besides a slightly different ending.  Remember BWP did it first and did it better.  Rent this first before buying or wait a few months and get this in the bargain bin if you must have it.  My suggestion is to pass on this and ""The Box"" as well.  You will be glad that you did.",1262044800,4,1120,4.251184834123222

Evidently, this is exactly what Paramount did to make a buck off this ridiculous piece of nothing.

3998467,5,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal Activity is a movie that play's on the viewer's fears and pushes the imagination over the edge. While I was watching this movie it was impossible not to think about sleeping alone with only the sounds of the night around me. I remembered those times where things felt...off. Time when I would wake up in the middle of the night with a strange feeling of being watched or footsteps in the hallway. Is it ghosts? Maybe. Am I the victim of my own imagination? Most likely. All I know is all of those things were in the mix as I found myself in Katie's and Micha's haunted home.

Paranormal Activity begins innocently enough with Micha purchasing a video camera to try to catch the strange disturbances in their home. On their first night they set camera up they catch their bedroom door moving on it's own. Micha feeling that he is onto something unique continues to interact with the demon despite a clear warning that to do so would be very dangerous.

As the night's go on the haunting become more malicious and more terrifying as it eventually gains enough power to haunt the couple during the day as well as the night. Each new attack continues to break down Katie and Micha. With each new attack I felt my own sense of dread rise. I began to fear the inevitable moment where the clock on the camera would slow and the demon made its next attack. I could feel the frustration and exhaustion from a lack of sleep and the sense of futility as their house became their prison and the eventual realization that there was nothing they could do stop what they had unleashed.

The use of the handheld camera was excellent as it seemed to reduce the line between movie and reality. Like the movie Cloverfield expert use of the handheld camera can heighten the viewing experience and brings the viewer into a nightmarish reality.

Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who is in tune enough to their surroundings and often wonders or worries about the things that go bump in the night.",1262044800,4,1992,4.555865921787709
3998468,3,B002VKE1K2,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw it three or four times while it was in theaters.  On first viewing, I immediately realized that this movie would have a completely polarized response, and it did.  Everyone who saw it was either completely creeped-out and liked it, or they were bored senseless and hated it.  My advice is to read Roger Ebert's review.  He really nailed this movie's appeal.  You can judge for yourself whether you'll like it or not just by what he had to say about it.

This is not the kind of horror film that's been coming out over the last ten years or so.  It is not gory.  It is a very subtle meditation on the sort of things that scare us when we're alone in the dark and our imaginations get the better of us.  There is no background score, only a deep, sustained rumble that ominously creeps in when the ""activity"" is present.

Everyone knows the plot by now.  A young, suburban couple has decided to film their lives in an attempt to prove/disprove and eventually deal with paranormal disturbances they have been encountering since moving in together.  The activity is most... well, active...  at night.  The camera is left on while the couple sleeps, and captures mild activity such as doors moving on their own and the sounds of what could only be footsteps.  I won't tell anything beyond that, but suffice it say that if you are willing to let yourself into the feel of this movie, it can be a fun and truly scary experience.  If you're waiting for something shockingly horrific to take place, stick with Saw sequels.

Now, onto the actual Blu-Ray...

I gotta admit, I was happy to own this movie, but I was kinda let down by the lack of special features.  The only thing on here other than the movie itself is an ""alternate"" version which is completely identical until the last scene of the movie.  The alternate ending is also available on it's own, so the need for two whole versions of the film seems extraneous.  No commentary, no deleted scenes, no interviews, no nothing.  The story of how this movie came to be released is actually very interesting, especially the involvement of Steven Speilberg.  There is even another ending (the original one) that could have been added.  Why did Paramount leave so much off of the release of one of the most talked-about movies of the year?  My guess is that this edition is just to tide us over while a more features-happy release is prepped.",1262044800,4,2421,4.559164733178655

There is nothing in the way of special features or options. There is no real main menu page. There is an alternate ending, but its not even the good alternative ending. It is totally unworth it. There were several endings shot for this movie and they decided to put the weakest of them as the alternate ending. There are much better versions that could have been added. Had they wanted to really expand this DVD, they could have. Instead they wanted to make a buck, and release this ASAP. Look at the Blair Witch DVD. We all know that its a fake movie, however the film is loaded with special features that keep pretending it really happened and it adds to the whole feel of the movie. For this DVD, there were infinite options for features beyond the movie. There are none. Everyone knows it is fake by now (hopefully) and its is also revealed that there is an alternate ending, why not go balls to the wall and do more?

And no, you will not see blood or guts; nor will 8 teenagers loose their clothing and then their heads. And finally, sorry, but no zombies will crawl out of the grave and try to eat everyone. If you have definite ideas about what makes a movie scary then you probably will not like this movie.

3998473,5,B002VKE1K2,"This is one of those movies that you just have to see atleast once, and not listen to other peoples opinion and decide for yourself if you like it or not. Ive noticed half the people i talked to about the film loved it, the other half hated it.  As you can clearly see by peoples ratings through Amazon that its about half 5 stars and half 1 star. Seeing it in the theater was truly an experience because people were really freaked out, i was too to be honest! But at the same time everybody was having alot of fun. There was alot of hype behind the film so the theaters were only showing it at midnight so it was packed from the front row to the very back, and had to buy tickets a day in advance.  The reason this movie stands out so much to me was because its setting was more like ""real life"" rather than a typical ""hollywood"" setting. Seems like the most recent horror/thriller movies made in the past decade have lacked uniqueness and creativity (The Unborn, The Haunting in Connecticut, The Grudge, The Messengers, etc) . They tend to  use more loud noises to scare the viewer, but Paranormal Activity was giving me the chills while it was completely silent.  Overall I haven't felt the chills during a movie since probably The Exorcist. There was a couple scenes in the movie that i would consider top 5 most frightening scenes in movie history!  Leaving the theater I was making fun of the girls that were in our group because they were still scared, but that night i almost didn't turn off the lamp in my room before bedtime! Oh yeah, for the record, I seen a couple reviews comparing it to The Blair Witch Project just because theres some motion in the camera, this is nothing like The Blair With Project.",1261958400,2,1716,4.383647798742138
3998474,4,B002VKE1K2,"THE MOVIE:  While I hated this when I saw it in the theater, oddly enough I found myself thinking about it a lot afterward, and now that I've re-watched it on DVD I've developed a kinder, gentler attitude towards the movie and even have a great regard for it now.  Sure, the characters are underdeveloped and at times irritating, and the narrative is languid, but the authenticity of the story is strong and convincing and the relaxed pace is mesmerizing, and allows the steadily escalating threat to creep up on you and throttle you when it needs to.  Overall, I'd say this is a worthy successor to ""The Blair Witch Project.""

THE DVD:  When played, the DVD goes right to a minimalist DVD menu with options to play the movie with the theatrical ending or a single alternate ending, so, to help keep the verisimilitude of the film intact, we're spared having to sit through a parade of movie trailers.  On the downside, I've heard that there were a number of alternate endings made, one of which I managed to catch online, so we may be hit with a double-dip that includes all of these somewhere down the line.  Apart from the alternate ending, the only other feature on the disc is a trailer for Dicaprio's new flick, ""Shutter Island.""

Fulfilling its promise to recognize the fans, Paramount has included a list of people who submitted their names to be included on the DVD, and the list can be accessed only after going through the movie itself.  The list runs for 15 minutes and seems to include thousands of names, so if you're looking for yours, have your Pause and Forward Frame buttons ready.

THE PACKAGING:  Lame.  The outer artwork for the DVD is decent, but the DVD itself looks like it has rental copy artwork, being coated in plain gray paint/ink with plain text.  As usual, there's no chapter insert, and as is becoming more and more usual, the plastic DVD case is an Eco Box, which means it has sections cut out on both sides of the inside.  So, be prepared to have another DVD case to replace this with.

FINAL VERDICT:  If you saw this in theaters and were disappointed, you might want to give it another chance and see if it grows on you.  Perhaps the biggest fault of this movie was the massive marketing machine behind it, which built up expectations for some people that it just couldn't reach.  The DVD treatment could be better, but it is surprisingly pretty good:  the menus look good, there's an alternate ending, and the list of fans is here.  However, the packaging is weak and there could always be a ""Paranormally Special Edition"" coming down the pike later this year with the rest of the alternate endings, so if you haven't been swayed yet, you might want to keep waiting in case a better DVD comes along (maybe without an Eco Box!  Grrr!).  Thanks for reading.",1261958400,2,2792,4.56425702811245

3998480,4,B002VKE1K2,"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY just opened here on the 24th as a nice Xmas present to any moviegoer. I didn't want to let one day pass before I saw this, specially after watching the trailer repeatedly.
Besides all every one can think or say about PA, be it vintage, modern or special-efx contemporary (overloaded) horror movie fans,
I can only say I didn't leave the theatre same as I entered. The sudden ending and lack of main and end credits, the very tense waiting for some expert to show up at the house, a ghost expert wanting to run away ""or whatever is inside could get really worse"" add up to well created edge-of-seat tension. I value this greatly compared to the cheap and massively abused special-effects overload of the last...say...10 years?
A great little device I loved here is the digital clock to the left of the screen shown during the sleep sequences, being  the only element that you can stick to when trying to judge how normal what the camera shows you every passing second really is. Accelerated display of passing time means a lot, too. Yes, it reminds of old great favourites of mine like the alarm clock close-ups on AMITYVILLE HORROR and other calendar or running clock time markers like in THE SHINING or the very great and must-see THE HUNTING , THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE or THE ENTITY (which great music score has just been issued on cd  after 27 years!)
Now, where I wanted to get to is you MUST make sure you see this either at the best sound-equipped movie theatre in your area or sitting in a well suited room for 5.1 or whatever the dvd sound format is. Sound post-production is possibly one of the most subtle and best accomplished I can remember and the grading of how the presence of the uninvited grows ""sonically"" more evidently each day is, to me, one of the best technical aspects of PA.
I would never change my beloved old THE EXORCIST as one of my Top 10 can't-stop-watching horror classics. But it's simply a different era in horror. PA might not become part of that top 10 list but it will keep me and many of you wondering for years to come, what really did happen in that house!. Now, I'm really worried about what will happen tonight, while I'm asleep. Do you have your handycam at hand?",1261612800,3,2226,4.507425742574258
3998481,1,B002VKE1K2,"I have finally got around to witnessing this much talked about movie.  I've heard and read many great things about it.  ""Scariest movie evar!!"" they said.  Not really - not even close.  About 10 minutes in I started getting that same nagging feeling in my gut that I had when watching The Blair Witch Project. It was that feeling like ""oh boy I am about to waste some time and walk away utterly disappointed"" - and I was.

This movie is not scary at all.  I see a lot of people's number one defense of this movie is ""you need a good imagination"".  I have a great imagination.  Was I wondering if it was the demon Pazuzu moving the sheets or having fun walking through the ingenious ""flour trap"" set by the heroic Micah? Not really. Would a demon have something better do to than follow around a chubby girl her whole life? I'm leaning towards probably.  But let's forget about the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" thing,  the gags themselves are not scary either.  There are things that could have been done, maybe with a tiny bit bigger budget, that would have produced some real chills.  A Ouija board moving by itself and then catching on fire was not one of them.  One of the more effective things in the movie was when the girl got out of bed and stood there for several hours - not exactly breaking the bank with that effect are we? They would have been better off stealing some of the effects from ""Ghost Hunters""(c'mon, you don't believe that show is real, do you?). Well at least they decided to include the paranormal staple of EVPs.  I think I heard the demon say ""I want a hamburger"" but I guess that's left up to interpretation of the garbled nonsense that's usually recorded.

Other problems were the acting and pace.  Acting is forgivable and I can look past it - I don't think they could afford Brad Pitt.  The pace of the movie sucked however.  You don't need money to fix the pace you need better writing.  Every ""night"" just left me more disappointed and I kept wondering when the movie was going to get good.  By the time something finally happened on the last night I really didn't care anymore, I was just thankful it was over.

If I was going to compare this movie to others in this sub-genre of demons and possession I would put this up against The Exorcist and Evil Dead.  If you really think this is better or scarier than those two movies you need to get your head checked(for demons possibly omg!)",1261353600,8,2424,4.424379232505643
3998482,5,B002VKE1K2,"In terms of a movie accomplishing what it set out to do, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY may be the movie of the year.  There are many, many flaws in it...but its goal is to give the viewer the willies, and it succeeds.  I seldom (and I DO MEAN seldom) notice my heart racing faster and find that I'm leaning forward in my seat when watching a movie.  I've seen it all, I feel like.

PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was a delightful exception.  I found it truly disturbing and agitating.  I actually felt dread.  The kind of feeling little kids get when watching a horror movie...the feeling of  having been shown another world that is really an awful place, and of not quite being able to separate it from reality.  While I never truly believed I was watching a true story...something about the film gave me genuine goosebumps.

In case you don't know, this is one of those ""found"" home videos that essentially shows how one couple who are being haunted used their camcorder to document the events.  The key moments come in the night, with the camera set at one end of the couple's bedroom, focused on their bed and the door leading into their room from the upstairs landing and hallway.  That's about it.  Katie & Micah are the couple, and aside from brief appearances by two minor characters, they are IT.  The whole thing was shot in a normal suburban house.  It was made VERY cheaply indeed.  (Yes, it is actually fiction...just like BLAIR WITCH.)

We saw it the night it opened in our city, and I can say that in the packed house, there were genuine screams of fright.  Most times we see a horror movie these days, the theatre is packed with teenagers who scream mostly to try to scare other members of their group or to elicit a laugh from the crowd.  There was some of that early on...but as the film developed a true silence fell over the crowd.  And it was only broken on occasion by screams that were NOT there to illicit laughs...they were genuine bursts of terror.  The experience made me fully realize how seldom we actually see genuinely scary stuff.

The thing that frustrates me (and is probably the reason I've waited so long to post a review), is that I honestly can't really explain why the movie works.  I seldom lack for an opinion and for support of that opinion...but I must scratch my head here.

The actors, also named Katie and Micah, are not actually all that great.  I assume they improvised much of their dialogue, and it has the feel of almost, but not quite, ""normal"" conversation.  Once in awhile, we have to wonder exactly WHY a character is insisting on carrying a camcorder with them...would you worry much about it if  you thought an evil entity was in your attic?  And it feels, on the surface, like a big gimmick.

Is it the fact that we can all relate to an ordinary suburban American house?  It may not look like our homes, but for most of us, it is in the ballpark.  Is it the idea of a ghost (or worse) coming into our bedrooms and crawling into bed with us as we sleep?  (Yes, that IS creepy, but why does it WORK so well in this film?)  Is it the fact that Micah and especially Katie look like real people, not stars (Katie is a perfectly normal woman who in comparison to the movie stars we see, looks positively pudgy)?  I'm simply not sure.  The execution seems far too simple.  It's not as though the director has used gadgetry or tricks.  Perhaps the lack of those tricks we so often see allows us to avoid the arms length feeling we get from glossier films.

I don't know, and I'm frankly tired of trying to figure it out.  I suspect the film will not play as well at home, unless you can get a crowd over and turn out all your lights.  It probably wouldn't hold up too well on repeat viewings, either.  But for me, it was truly, chillingly effective, and thus I have to give it very high marks indeed.",1261094400,4,3829,4.397435897435898

STARRING: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat and Mark Fredrichs

WRITTEN BY: Oren Peli

DIRECTED BY: Oren Peli

Rated: R
Genre: Horror
Release Date: 16 October 2009

Several movie advertisements have used this line for years and I have never found it to be even remotely true until now; so I'm going to use it: Paranormal Activity is the scariest film since The Exorcist. There, I've finally been able to use it!

Now that I have your attention, let me save half of you the three minutes that it will take you to finish reading this review and the roughly 90 it'll save you from actually watching the film. If you hated The Blair Witch Project because you thought it was stupid, then you will inevitably despise this film as well. There. See how nice of a guy I am? Now you can spend those 90 minutes doing something you enjoy.

For those of you still reading, I will take it that you appreciated the brilliant and unique style of The Blair Witch Project, as did I. You will most likely love this film as well.

The Blair Witch Project clearly inspired this film, as it has others and was a slightly better film. But Paranormal Activity is easily 10 times more frightening.

I'm told its entire budget was just 15 thousand dollars and it has already grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office.

NO; regardless of what you have heard, the film is not real. Neither was The Blair Witch Project or Quarantine or The Fourth Kind.

The film looks and feels real though, and that's why it's so terrifying. We are lead to believe that it is `found footage' by the police and that for whatever reason, they are allowing it to be released in theaters nation-wide.

The entire thing is shot with a home video camera, operated completely by the two main characters: Katie and Micah. They're a couple with a little more than a lump in the mattress causing problems in their relationship; a demon to be exact.

We learn in the first few minutes that for several nights they have witnessed strange `paranormal activity' occurring while they sleep. Micah buys the video camera and explains this to us as we meet Katie when she pulls up in their driveway. We follow them back into the house and with the exception of a scene in the backyard; we never leave the home again for the remainder of the film.

It is soon revealed that Katie has been haunted by this demonic spirit for several years, no matter where she goes. They agree to set up the video camera in their bedroom in hopes of capturing evidence of such said `paranormal activity'.

That's when it gets creepy. The camera is positioned in the same place every night and a little time dial lets us know what time it is. Every time you see the camera positioned in the corner of the room like that, you know it's about to get scary. And it does, trust me.

At first we just hear noises. Then the door moves all by itself. Then we start to see shadows and that's all I'm going to tell you.

This is not one of those movies that you will think is just so-so. You will either love it or you will hate it. You will either find it incredibly horrifying; leaving to your imagination what is causing all of this to happen or you will be completely irritated at how lame it is.

I think it is much more fun to leave it up to your imagination what the demon looks like. Yes; I know that it is just a guy downstairs making noise and turning on lights and what have you. But it's freaking scary in the movie! You let your mind believe that it's a demon and that's what makes it so fun.

The actors don't seem like actors. They feel like real people being themselves on a reality show. When the events begin to take a toll on them and they become scared, you believe that they are going through this for real. (Not literally; I mean you believe their acting performances. It's a movie people; that's all).

The only reason it's not a prefect film, is that just like in any horror movie; the characters do stupid things. Especially Micah.

You will want to strangle him by the end of the film. He is constantly being a testosterone-driven moron and challenging the demon; thus making it angrier.

Also, why didn't they ever leave the house? It's explained by a paranormal expert that leaving won't help anything but it's very obvious this is only in the movie because they wanted an excuse to be able to continue shooting in the same location.

When the paranormal expert won't help them due to the overwhelming evil presence in the house, why couldn't they have called in someone else? I'm sure he wasn't the only one around.

Regardless if you get slightly annoyed by this towards the end of the film like I did, they make it up to you in the last 20 minutes or so. Most of the film drags on and I can see how it can be boring. But trust me, if you can make it to the end you will be more than satisfied!

It is truly disturbing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Every time they go to bed and you see the little time dial, it's like listening to the tick tack of a roller coaster climbing to the top of the track; you know that something awful but exciting lies just ahead and you can't help but cringe and your heart is racing.

I know the film is fake but I am still amazed at how they were able to pull off some of the events that take place. There are no wires folks; there are no obvious bad computer graphics either. The filmmakers took their 15 grand and spent it very wisely. I'm glad to have given them my money. It was the best 7 bucks I've spent to be scared in a very long time.",1260921600,23,5559,4.326275264677575
3998504,4,B002VKE1K2,"We saw this movie in the theater, which was a really good way to see it, but I'm guessing that watching it in a dark house would be phenomenal!
The beginning of the movie had to establish the characters, so it was a bit boring. You really had to use your imagination through the first half of the movie, and I think it is more the IDEA that something could happen was more of the fear factor. That said, the movie was pretty intense in some parts, and I literally screamed LOUDLY at one point, which is not something I have done in a movie theater before.
There are a lot of comparisons between this and Blair Witch, and I can see that. However, Blair Witch had a lot more action in the evening scenes, and I was too afraid to actually scream out when I saw that one in the theater.
I love scary movies, and to find one that is unique and you don't know what is going to happen next, it is a real treasure. For those who are scary movie fanatics, this movie is a must-own.",1260489600,4,972,4.121052631578947
3998505,1,B002VKE1K2,"I have never in my life hated a movie or a video game or anything so badly that I gave it a ZERO. Paranormal Activity changed that. (Okay, technically I gave it a 1, but that's only because the scale doesn't go all the way down to zero. In my mind, I just gave it a zero because there's nothing good about this movie.)

The movie was absolutely terrible. I was bored out of my mind for the entire movie. Half the scenes in the movie were the two main characters (a couple) bickering (and no one pays for a horror movie to see people bicker--unless they die as a result of or shortly after they bicker). The other half of the scenes (the ones that were supposed to be scary) was just sitting around for a few minutes waiting for something to happen. And then something incredibly lame (on the order of furniture moving by itself) would happen. I actually found myself checking my watch every few minutes to see how much longer I'd have to suffer through this. (30 minutes into the movie, I considered walking out of the movie as a result of the excruciating boredom, but I decided against it since I was here with friends and they needed to give me a ride home.)

The ""scary"" scenes themselves were pretty underwhelming. Aside from the fact that they were so few and so short and so lame, they were completely predictable, completely cliche. Every ""scary"" thing that happened I could see coming from a mile away, and my reaction was more of ""seriously, that's the best they could come up with?"" rather than one of fear. The sole exception, the one time when something happened that I didn't expect, it actually amused me to the point that I burst out in laughter. Only the most sheltered of people would find this stuff scary. Either that or people who come in with the mindset of wanting or expecting to be scared. But someone in that mindset could also be scared by your friendly neighbor saying ""hi"".

The movie has been described to me by multiple sources as ""weird sounds in the middle of the night"". Yeah, I hear weird sounds at night every frickin' night, and I'm still not scared. Maybe if a monster jumped out and dragged me out of my bed, then I'd be scared. But I'd be scared of getting dragged out of my bed by a monster with or without this movie.

Maybe all of this garbage would have been worth it if there was a nice payoff at the end. But no, the payoff was literally in the last few seconds of the movie. And to top it off, that payoff was something I'd already predicted as soon as the movie began.

Now don't misunderstand me. I love horror movies. I even enjoy the really really bad ones. But even I hated Paranormal Activity. It was painfully boring, predictable to the point of cliche, and simply not scary at all. I'll even take a page from the book of Comic Book Guy and call it the Worst Movie Ever.

I don't regret it, though. I actually love writing reviews about grossly overrated pieces of entertainment where I just completely trash them. And Paranormal Activity gave me that opportunity.",1260489600,10,3018,4.419064748201439
3998506,3,B002VKE1K2,"= SPOILERS=

This low-budget thriller is occassionally effective, occassionally inane. Most of the film's problems stem from the male character, Micah. It is obvious that the story needs to be propelled, however, his actions often lack the authenticity the film so desperately relies on. Micah quickly becomes a caricature of skepticism and male bravado. He begins, understandably enough, as dismissive of his girlfriend Katie's story of a lifetime of haunting, but as the story goes on, his stubborn refusal to allow her to bring in outside help becomes unrealistic. Even after seeing irrefutable physical evidence of an entity around them, he continues to assert that he should be the one to protect his girlfriend. Even as he continues to profess a form of cynicism, he actively, and against his girlfriend's EXPRESS wishes, attempts to communicate with the entity, predominantly through juvenile taunting and a Ouija board. This Ouija board plot thread is completely pointless as it adds nothing to the story and actually serves to weaken it, as Micah attempts to explain that the 'demon' wants to inexplicably 'warn them'... about itself(?).

The dialogue is mostly improvised, and this fact is sometimes distractingly clear. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it resorts to the old 'The killer was never found!' trope to leave the audience's nerves on end as they leave the theater.

With that said, the film is very admirable in its ability to conjure tension and suspense with no latex or CGI beasties. The film has drawn a lot of comparisons to 'The Blair Witch Project' and many are valid. However, I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' a couple of months before it was released widely, and as such, had heard nothing about it. As I sat in the theater, I suspected it was fiction, but was never convinced. I imagine, even if I had heard nothing about 'Paranormal Activity', my disbelief would not have been suspended for nearly as long.",1260403200,7,1955,4.972477064220183

My wife wanted to see it cause everyone kept telling here bout all these reviews and how scary its supposed to be; i told her i did not want to waste my time watching this crap movie. Well i gave in cause my brother was even like 'its supposed to be the scariest movie in the last 20 years."" Wish i would have stuck with my gut feeling on this one. Theres nothing scary about this movie. period. a few footprints and loud thumps and doors closing. 90% of this movie feels like its being shot in the bedroom with the camera pointed towards the door. Most of the movie is filled with them just talking and going through there day. The end could maybe be freaky at most, but really, it wasn't even anything to write home about. PLease do not waste your time on this movie. If you like blood n guts or any kind of gore stay away. if you like movies like wickerman, cloverfield, and the blair witch project movies then watch this movie you might enjoy.

3998509,5,B002VKE1K2,"Low budget indie films have been a good way for amateur filmmakers to break out for a long time. Kevin Smith broke out with a black and white movie made for $67,000 called Clerks; El Mariachi, made for only $7,000, turned Robert Rodriguez into a big name rebel director in the 90's. Horror is a harder medium to make it in the low budget arena. A field dominated by gory and effects driven movies these days, horror saw a megahit in 1999's Blair Witch Project. Made for only $11,000, Blair Witch Project has often been duplicated, but the success was never repeated. Here we are, 10 years later, and a new phenomenon has come around with Paranormal Activity, a movie that doesn't try to be Blair Witch, but exceeds expectations. Made also for only $11,000, Paranormal Activity has made a huge splash in the mainstream breaking records in the process (in it's first weekend it broke $7 million in only 200 theaters), but is it really worth all the fuss?

After a series of ""supernatural"" events have happened in their house, Micah, decides to get a video camera to substantiate their claims of a haunting. Katie (who's engaged to be engaged to Micah) has had these supernatural events happen to her since she was 8, she wants them to stop, and while she's not entirely comfortable with Micah recording the events, she goes along with it. They meet with a psychic who feels they're dealing with a demon and suggests a demonologist to help them take care of their problem. Micah doesn't take it seriously, and believes they can get rid of their visitor without outside help. Despite Katie's warnings and worry, Micah keeps trying to provoke the entity. Tensions build, tempers flare, and the paranormal activity gets more intense till it finally reaches the breaking point.

Originally bought by Paramount with the intention of owning the rights to remake the movie with a better budget and bigger names, Paranormal Activity fares better without the higher production values of a big budget film. Shot with one handheld camera and without a score, the movie feels completely real. The use of unknown actors also gives the film a more authentic feel, and it helps that they don't really feel like they're acting as well. As each day unfolds, we find ourselves prisoners in the house, which adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. We learn every nook and cranny of the house, so we notice the moving shadows, and the changes that occur all the more later on in the film.

All in all, Paranormal Activity is a very well done horror film, stripping away many of the conventions we see in horror film, relying on real scares rather than gore or music cues to instill a sense of tension and fear in the audience. I highly recommend seeing this in theaters if you have the opportunity, the atmosphere of seeing this with others really helps with adding fear to the proceedings as large groups intensify the feeling among those in the group. For those of you planning on taking the children, there is foul language, but on top of that the film does start off slowly and the more nuanced scenes may be lost on a younger audience. Definitely give this film as a chance as it is worth the hype, even if only for the last scene of the movie!

3998510,5,B002VKE1K2,"After see this film i could easily say without a doubt
i was never more scared by a movie in my life.

I think mixed opinion is made on this movie
however i am writing to clarify a few misconceptions so many people made that possibly made them think the film was terrible

1. This was NOT A HORROR FILM
it was never categorized as one and did not need special effects or gore, the film was if you need to categorize it
more so a mockumentary of sorts
as the characters are regular people just like you or i
they weren't going to save the world or battle some undead zombie
because it was supposed to feel like they were regular people
and i very much doubt in alot of your own lives you battle zombies and save the world each day.

2. They intentionaly didn't have a script
this is something i see alot of people complainig about how there wasn't a seemingly made script, and the director said so himself he didn't want one
reasons being
that, for 1, while this film was originaly made just for a low budget film festival, the success of it plotted it to be taken to big time theaters, hence the kids had no idea this would be seen worlwide and become what is it today
also, not having a script works better at believing the characters are more realistic and seemingly are just a couple who moved into a new home, just like many of us are and do these days.

they were made to resemble people just like us
not super heroes
the entire point and concept of the film was to make you believe you weren't watching a film, but more so a recording a couple made of events in their home, that they had no intention of showing the whole world to.
or just like if you or your own friends went ghost hunting and filmed your experiences.

3. Childhood fears
a huge misconception in this film is that this is supposed to be some over the top special effects monster that walks into the house and jsut causes hell. No that was never the case, in fact the director
if you look on wikipedia has said that he wanted to make a film
about the childhood fears all of us have had about
the dark
creaking sounds in the night you hear when it is really late and everyone else is asleep

and all the images our imaginations ran with as a child of what is hiding in our closet, under our bed or in the dark in general

4. what happens when you are asleep
fact is NOBODY KNOWS despite what you say
no one really does know
this film is taking the camera and making you see everything that could happen when you are asleep and esentialy making you believe that all the stuff you feared as a kid in the dark
is indeed very REAL

5. Its all in what you believe spiritualy
many people on here are saying the characters are stupid
and didn't get help if all that stuff was happening
well fact is the psychic said so himself that no matter where the girl goes it will follow her. This film can be put in the category of similar films like the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose
as it is dealing with spiritual forces we can not see
can not fight with our fists and most of all cant just not believe they are there, i think until either creationism or evolution is finaly considered to be the one true theory, then the world will never trully know of what lies beyond this world, i believe there are spirits in the world, some good some bad, we cant choose which ones pick us much like the fate of the girl katie in the film.

so basicaly if you are an athiest who doesnt believe in any afterlife or spiritual forms then you probably will find this movie a bore.

6. Let down your guard of "" i know how this is done"" and view the film with the openness and wonder you had as a child

Yes obvioulsy this was just a film and mika and katie are on ET cover now, but thats beside the point the point of this entire film
is to let down your guard of how you think you know everything
and get a glimpse at the possiblity that everything you ever feared about being alone in the dark and monsters under your bed
COULD BE TRUE.

3998547,4,B002VKE1K2,"I couldn't avoid the massive hype before forking over my money to see the film that many called the scariest movie ever made. I sat down in my seat prepared to jump at least a few times before the end credits, but it only gave me one mild jolt at the very end. That's not to say that Paranormal Activity isn't creepy, it really is. It's neat how a few loud noises or a flick of a light switch in the middle of the night (there are a few more elaborate gags than these as the film progresses) creates more tension than any big budget horror film in years. I got goosebumps a couple of times and the less is more approach (whether due the whopping $11,000 budget or not) made it much more unsettling. The Jaws rule of the less you see, the scarier it is, definitely applies here. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project make sense. They are both horror films, shot dirt cheap (though Blair Witch had twice the budget) and have the same documentary like style. Only in this case, I was happy to find none of those frantic camera movements that made so many people want to hurl leaving the theater back in 1999. The two main cast members are unknown, but they were much better than expected. The dude got on my nerves a little at times and the arguing got tiresome in between the night scares, but they were successful in seeming like real people documenting the paranormal, not actors.

Paranormal Activity is slow moving, especially the first half, and it doesn't live up to the hype, but I envy those who just recently heard about this little movie. I saw it with a small crowd and I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable with a packed theater (unless it's full of stupid teens laughing at everything). I liked it quite an bit and unlike The Blair Witch Project, I can see this one becoming a minor classic.

I'm not sure how it will hold up on DVD and Blu-ray, because it was combination of the huge screen, the loud surround sound and the dark theater that made this thing work.",1259625600,,1981,4.365853658536586
3998548,5,B002VKE1K2,"Went to see this with my wife and we both loved it. It builds slowly and comes to a climactic, albeit un-Hollywood ending. I'm sure the home release will be great, especially if the other two alternate endings are included.

This film does have a lot of haters. Fortunately they're mostly wrong. The movie does build rather slowly, but it fits in with the flow of the story.

It pretty much boils down to the fact that the people who badmouth this film are either the type of people who think that the quality of a film has a direct correlation with the amount of gore in it, or people who simply lack the attention span to sit and watch a movie with an actual story, instead of explosions and boobs (see: Michael Bay).

I received the BluRay today.

I was happy to see that the elusive third version of the ending is included (which was only shown at one showing and features Katie walking up to the camera and, well, just watch it.)

I am very disappointed to say that the second version of the ending shown at most film festivals is absent.

Also, they found it fit to include a Spanish dub of their dialogue, but absolutely nothing in the way of extra features. They even put the trailer for Shutter Island in there, and yet no making of or extra features. The BlueRay transfer does look very good though. Much better than I expected considering how it was filmed.

I still give the movie 5 stars, but the BluRay version is woefully lacking.",1259625600,5,1445,4.409774436090226
3998549,5,B002VKE1K2,"The movie starts with no studio logos- instead of logos we get a title card from the producers thanking the local Police department and Katie Featherston/Micah Sloat's parents thanking them for the footage. From that point, you know you are going to see some amateur footage from Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, investigating a series of paranormal occurrences in their home involving an unwelcome presence of a Demon.

Paranormal Activity was made in 2006 on a budget of $15,000 by Oren Pireli. It was his debut movie and was shot in 10 days. It didn't get any screenings until 2007, and Steven Spielberg had been given a DVD screener to watch. He apparently got so scared that he couldn't watch the whole movie. However, nonetheless he enjoyed it and ended up finishing it.

I saw the screener copy that has been floating around the internet this past halloween, and invited a friend over. The movie made for some creepy fun, and I can guarantee you that this may be the creepiest movie I've seen, and certinaly the most intense movie I've seen in a while!

The first 10 minutes may bore you a little, as before we get to the creepshow, we get a bit of an introduction to Kaitie and Micah's life. The first time we see the ""in the bedroom"" shot, it's basically a demo of what we're about to see. After an encounter with a psychic, which offers some interesting insight into Katie's child life and history of being haunted by this presence, we then skip right into the night time scenes. Once the nighttime scenes come, you immediately are on the edge of your seat and unsure of what will happen. My favorite one was the moment the footsteps get louder and louder and the door shuts- a classic creepy moment. THe whole movie is intense, and about 3/4 of the way through, I was unsure if I could watch it anymore, it was so scary!

One thing the cut I saw is known for is its ending, which was changed for it's theatrical release by Steven Spielberg. I cannot see why he chose to do that- the ending, in my opinion, is one of the greatest endings ever filmed- extremely morbid, hopeless, devastating, and it stays with you. No such horror movie ending has been THAT effective.

I can see why people hated this movie, as it's not a real jumpy or gory or violent movie. There is zero violence in this movie, with the exception of a gunshot and the implication that someone has died. THere is no gore either, something I really liked. This is the scary that Hitchcock is famous for- intense, brooding, PARANORMAL. It's scary because of what little there is. My dad, who never gets scared, couldn't enjoy it because of how terrifying it was. Hitchcock would be proud of Pireli, and I'm glad this movie has been a huge, worldwide sensation... that said, this is one of the best, and most underrated horror movies ever made.

In short, if you are a hyper kid who needs tons of jump moments, gore, and ultra-violence, avoid this. This movie is for people who are patient people who let things come when they will, and for thinkers. And because I am one of those, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me. Kudos to Pireli for great direction, and kudos to Sloat and Featherston for their great performances.

Yeah, we get the occasional odd noise or whatever, but let's face it, 99% of supposed ""hauntings"" come from errant breezes slamming doors or clanking in the pipes. You start wondering whether there really is a haunting to be had here, despite the viral marketing campaign that made this this #1 movie on its opening weekend.

By now, of course, you know that it was also the #1 movie on its second weekend. Marketing doesn't do that by itself. Fifty-two minutes into Paranormal Activity, things get honest-to-god scary. First-time filmmaker Oren Peli uses all the banality he built up in the first half of the movie very well by throwing it back in our faces. Man, I hope his second movie is a family drama/chick flick kind of thing. Imagine what he could do with that. Because Paranormal Activity is the flat-out scariest movie to hit theaters in a decade. Maybe more. Why? Because Peli understands the concept that what happens off the screen is scarier than what happens on the screen, and he uses it, Val Lewton-like, to make us curl up into the fetal position and rock back and forth in our seats imagining what's going on. (Note: this is a good time to mention that at least three endings were filmed for this movie. Oddly, it was actually released in three different versions simultaneously. If the Val Lewton-ness of the picture breaks in the final ten minutes, find another theater, or rent it on DVD when you can. There's one perfect ending. If you saw it, you know it.)

As well, this is a scary movie because it's very well-written. You get to know and care about these characters. This is a very good thing considering the bulk of the movie is a two-person flick (and I have documented my affinity for the two-person flick in a number of past reviews). It takes above-average writing and acting to pull off the two-person movie, and Peli, helped out by Katie Featherston (Mutation) and Micah Sloat (in his first acting job), delivers in spades.

Simple, solid, and scary. What more can you ask for in a horror movie? See it. See it now. **** ",1259539200,3,2294,4.696517412935323
3998553,5,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal Activity has terrified and greatly affected the majority of the audience that has had a chance to view this astounding piece of work. Oren Peli, the director, has no professional experience whatsoever. Shot in just a mere seven days, using a minuscule budget of $15,000, the film utilizes a couple of relatively inexperienced leading actors, and a soundtrack of absolute silence. The hairs of nearly every viewer are raised each time the leading pair falls asleep. Unlike other recent horror films that boast screaming attractive women, two tons of fake blood and gore, a horrible, disgustingly cheesy script, and implausible explosions, this film works wonders with average looking actors, improvised screenplay with situational suggestions.

The basic premise of this shockingly simple haunted house tale is that successful day-trader Micah and English teacher Katie have recently moved in together after dating for some time. Prior to the first few moments of the audience sees, Katie tells a skeptical Micah that paranormal activity has been bothering her since her childhood and he reacts by purchasing a video camera to capture any abnormal activity that might manifest itself while they sleep to prove her wrong. The film follows the day-to-night-day-night life of the couple. The realism of the film is finely showcased with the mundane conversations and bantering of the couple during the day, to the slightly begging of using the camera to record sexual activities by Micah before night falls. The audience laughs during the day sequences at some of the hilarity; some recollecting similar humor in their own relationships. But then night falls. The audience suddenly grows silent. What follows after that are goosebumps, gasps of horror, some frightened audience members leaving the theater, and some audience members shaking in their seats.

The film is not like a Hollywood film. In fact, it is not but it was adopted by Paramount Pictures after they were astounded by its widely marketable potential. The marketing scheme has thus far worked superbly but it is unfair to view the film with those high expectations of perfection. The film has some outstanding flaws even with its best quality being its engrossing realism and is by no means, the greatest film of the year, nor is it the scariest film of all-time. Those expectations are not fair. While the film may not be scarier than the scariest film of all-time in your opinion, it is arguably the most psychologically affecting film of the decade because of how effectively it strips you of the mental securities of your safest haven: your own home.

Thus far, no other film has frightened me so, and still, I cannot deny how much I would love to see it again, because of how beautifully it has been made. Paranormal Activity is not just one of the scariest film of the decade, it is one of the best independent films of the year.",1259539200,,2909,5.031120331950207
3998574,1,B002VKE1K2,"The fact that any decent critics -- not to mention flacks in disguise like Roger Ebert and Peter Travers -- gave this highly unoriginal, amateurish film a high rating, that Steven Spielberg monkeyed himself out like a trailer-park idiot (on the level of Shrub choking on a pretzel) in reference to a ""possessed"" bathroom to help generate buzz for a project he was about to purchase, and the general public forked over more than $100 million precious recession bucks for this cardboard thrill ride is quite disappointing. This bland misogyny parable makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Last Broadcast"" look like ""Citizen Kane"" by comparison.

Yes, I think we all know by now that horror movies which don't succumb to tossing around buckets of gore or parading monsters before the camera every few minutes create more tension, but the studios don't buy into intellectual horror specifically because the money's in more meat-headed fare. Newsflash: Most of the general movie-going public are knuckle-dragging oxygen wasters. By god, the latest ""Friday the 13th,"" which cost a mere $19 million, scared up $65 domestically, and there's nothing more shocking about a Jason Voorhees slashfest than the Mandrill cage at the zoo right before feeding time.

Studios don't take gambles, period, and this is not intellectual horror anyway. The icing on the cake is the cheesy reworked ending that leaves room for sequel after sequel (and mark my words, ""Paranormal Activity 2"" is guaranteed to be a gorefest). Besides, the formula for this outing has already been successfully tested: Hype it and they will come. Throw in a few stories about people bolting from the theater mid-film (I wouldn't be surprised to find out people were paid to run from the aisles) and presto! No wonder a useless hamster cat-toy is the best-selling holiday item for humans this year. I'm a rat in a cage, indeed.

The acting, adequate at first, quickly turns annoying and unbelievable (this couple is too trailer trash to actually live in a nice area of San Diego -- the boyfriend is too much of a borderline personality to realistically be ""engaged to be engaged"" with anybody, and the girlfriend is like some latchkey kid who never grew up; I'm not surprised at all by how things turn out for the guy in the end. Like I said, it's just a supernaturally tinged exercise in personality disorders.

Even though there are no special effects, no manifestation of evil, this film still manages to go for cheap frights. Think of the black cat jumping out of the darkness in a Hammer film ... and nothing more complex. And if you actually think the scenes of the camera filming the bed ARE scary after the 10th time -- this thing is like ""Groundhog Day"" without any of its charm, for chrissakes -- you deserve to live in the bubble with which you surround yourself.",1259366400,8,2832,4.857142857142857
3998575,1,B002VKE1K2,"I honestly felt like a foreclosure victim once the credits begin to roll. I felt a disgust, then an anger at Paramount for basically jipping me out of my money to see this garbage. Allow me explain:

1) Incredibly dull. The first 45min are a complete and utter waste of time. The audience is treated to watching a young couple argue, eat cereal, brush their teeth, and watch a Ouija board burn.

2) Too lazy to even make it look like the ""mockumentary"" it's tries to be. For example, a psychic visits the house and the first conversation between himself and the couple is shamelessly edited. I thought this was supposed to be ""found"" footage.

3) Scary? Absolutely not. It's about as scary as watching a handful of cute puppies playing with fluffy kittens. It reduces the audience to cheap parlor-house tricks: slamming doors, broken glass, and loud banging noises- yes- the kind of tripe you'll find at your local neighborhood haunted house, although this time, you'll be paying a lot more to see it.

Honestly, this film really, really shook all confidence I had in ""professional"" movie reviewers and movie websites. I employ people to see ""user reviews"" not professional critics as you'll see the great majority of the public was disgusted by this farce.

**Also, an easy way to spot the fraudulent, studio reviews is they'll read overly professional. They'll also come across as movie experts citing several older, much better films trying to compare this garbage to them. I'm no movie expert and I honestly liked Blair Witch. This is not an assault on independent films at all.**

Paramount honestly should've given everyone who went to see this tripe a complimentary gallon of vaseline - because that's how much you'll need to survive the relentless gangbang the studio gives the viewing public. I haven't the slightest doubt hundreds of interns and temp workers were hired for the sole purposes of promoting this film through the internet - targeting younger audiences through facebook, twitter and other social networking sites. It really was disgusting.

LOL. Nice try with selling this DVD. I hope someone buys every copy in circulation only to return them after watching 10 minutes of this heaping sack of excrement.",1259366400,6,2227,4.938502673796791
3998576,5,B002VKE1K2,"I am a fan of horror films and suspense films. I've seen just about every kind from slasher movies like Nightmare on Elm Street to the classics like Psycho. I soon realized that it is the old classic movies, especially by Alfred Hitchcock, that truly could keep me awake at all hours of the night listening to every creak and groan.

Nowadays audiences don't see true suspense anymores, we don't have simple shadowy figures that haunt us or terrified thrill of anticipation. Horror has been replaced with gore, blood and mythic monsters like Jason or Freddy Kruegar which seem to me, too fantastic to be scary. While watching a person being decapitated may be disturbing, it isn't truly terrifying and often times these CGI effects are inaccurate and ruin the thrill.

Hitchcock knew that it was the anticipation and our own imagination that trully terrified us. It wasn't actually seeing the monster but just imagining it that would get the hair rising on the back of our necks. Anticipating and wondering what would happen next was what truly scared us more than actually seeing it in action. Because our imagination gives us a wealth of knowledge and we will draw upon our own fears, what scares one person will not always scare the next. Mythic monsters like Jason will only frighten those who ARE afraid of him...what about those who aren't. But if the monster has no face...then everyone will imagine the worst.

That is beauty of Paranormal Activity. I had truly believed I was done being frightened by ""horror"" movies because all of the monsters were alike. Then I decided to see this one...and I didn't sleep a wink the night afterwards.

There are no special effects, no CGI, no music and no gore, just actors the eerieness of night and the door swinging open, the rest is left to be filled by our own fears. We don't need to see the demon to be terrified, we just have to be left wondering what will happen next and then our own horror gives way to keep us chilled to our bones.

The sad thing is that too much CGI has robbed some people of truly appreciating their own fears. I remember arguing with someone after this movie was released who said, ""What is so terrifying about a door opening?"" My response was simple, ""There is nothing scary about a door swinging open, but it is the knowledge that something is going to happen, our own wonderings and fears about what will happen next...that is what is terrfying.""

I was shaking all the way home after seeing this movie, every whisper, every thump sent chills down my spine because I never actually got to see what was haunting this couple. Because of this, I was left wondering and this way I will never be disappointed because my own imagination can ALWAYS come up with something far scarier than Fredd Kruegar or Jason could ever be.

Fans of blood and gore will not like this movie, they do not want to take the time to let their imagination truly terrify them. Those who remember the classic Hitchcock films will celebrate that some people do remember that sometimes there is more to horror than just disembowling someone...sometimes it is simply what we cannot see that will haunt our nightmares.",1259193600,6,3166,4.673249551166966

It's not one of the best I've seen only because it's one of the scariest, it's also one of the most realistic! The mix of realism, suspense and tension is just perfect!

A lot of people say that it's boring and I really don't get it. It's WAY too suspenseful to be boring. I've been trying to understand why the people that thought that it was boring went to see it since it was released. Why does someone who get bored easily go see a movie about a couple filming in their house? Why does someone who hated The Blair Witch Movie go see a similar movie? While we're at it, why does someone expect to be scared in a theater full of people? The fact that there are idiotic teens that can't stop talking and laughing 90% of the time doesn't help. Personally, I can't imagine finding a movie scary with 30 persons around me. I thought that the movie was scary (compared to most movies), but I watched it alone in the dark with an headset. The fact that I believe (or want to) in ghosts/demons helped as well. Actually, I can't imagine someone who doesn't believe in ghosts/demons finding a movie about them scary. What makes ghost/demons movies scary is the fact that there's no proof that they don't exist.

Anyway, the first few minutes of the movie was the only time that I didn't feel uneasy! The atmosphere was simply creepy! Hell, even a few parts with nothing but the couple talking were creepy! I guess that it was the expectation that something really bad was going to happen. The movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and/or scary images and doesn't have any over-the-top scare, it's all about tension and suspense.

It's not for people who need action every 5 minute and over-the-top scares. It's not for people who take trailers seriously and go see movies with unrealistically high expectations. It's not for people who watch movies with a closed minded and try NOT to get scared.

Finally, if it wasn't hyped, it would be much more appreciated. Some people just HAVE to hate hyped movies. Some others are so naive that they believe the hype.

3998581,4,B002VKE1K2,"A well-written review of any film should never label its subject ""good"" or ""bad"".  Rather, it should give you an idea of whether or not you can expect to enjoy it, based on your own preferences and expectations.  Paranormal Activity is a particularly controversial film when it comes to the potency of its terror.  Most reviews either complain, with great disdain, ""I hated it - it wasn't scary at all"" or exclaim in total satisfaction, ""It scared the pants off me - I loved it"".  There seems to be little in-between.

I saw the film today, having read enough reviews to know pretty much what to expect.  But before I reveal my own reaction to Paranormal Activity, I would like to offer a few ideas that those who know little about this film may find helpful.

Alfred Hitchcock, the celebrated director who was known as ""The Master of Suspense"" held many interesting theories about what frightens an audience.  Hitchcock believed that, when properly stimulated, the viewer's imagination was far more powerful - and far scarier - than many direct images that may or may not frighten the average viewer.  Directly depicting a ghost, a monster or a demon for example, even with today's special effects, may scare many viewers, but that will depend solely on the quality of the effects.  And even if well done, many viewers may find the images unconvincing or downright laughable, for they may have other ideas about what a ghost, monster or demon should look like.

However, if the filmmaker merely implies that a supernatural event is taking place, and sets up the situation with enough skill, the viewer's imagination can take over and sometimes yield a far more frightening experience than any vivid imagery ever will.  After all, people go to horror films to be frightened, and what could be more frightening than unseen terrors from one's own imagination?  By setting the mood with dark rooms, low lighting, eerie shadows and other effects that many people will associate with their greatest fears, an innocent image of two people peacefully sleeping, unaware of what may be going on about them or to them, can become very frightening indeed, even if few special effects are used.  This is especially true if the moviegoer has developed enough empathy with the characters to place themselves in the same situation.

Many modern horror films rely on blood, gore and violence, with horrible creatures conjured up by special effects and vivid scenes involving battles with ugly demons or manic killers in order to provide thrills.  That can be a lot of fun, and certainly very scary.  But it can also be argued that, as CGI effects advance and become more vivid and frighteningly realistic, many viewers become inured to violence, blood and ""creatures"" while depending less and less on their own imagination, and in the process, they will sometimes forgo a far scarier experience.  I know that no special effect ever came close to my own nightmares, because my nightmares are stirred by the things I fear most, and not the things that I've been conditioned to find scary.  In short, no amount of vivid terrors can match the human imagination, provided that the imagination is properly stimulated.

Well, this is the basic idea behind Paranormal Activity.  Largely on a shoestring budget, the writers/director/actors of Paranormal Activity have managed to create an old-fashioned thriller that relies almost exclusively on the viewer's imagination.  Those who like their ""scary movies"" full of CGI, monsters, blood and violence are warned; you will probably be extremely disappointed.  But if you have enough respect for your own imagination, and can allow yourself to be frightened not by what you see, but by what you think is there, you just may find Paranormal Activity to be every bit as frightening and well done as many people say it is.

By the way, I saw it with a friend.  He did not find it frightening at all.  On the other hand, I definitely expect to have trouble sleeping tonight.  Whether or not you will agree may depend on how effective your own imagination can be.

3998582,5,B002VKE1K2,"I am a fan of paranormal shows. Ghosthunters, Paranormal State, Ghost Adventures, Supernatural, etc. I watch them all.

Paranormal Activity was good. It is certainly not as scary as the commercials make it out to be, but it is better than an episode of Ghosthunters. In fact, it is pretty much like Paranormal State.

You may get a kick out of the couple's interactions, especially with the boyfriend's obsession with capturing everything on camera and playing it back on his PCs (he has a few).

I won't spoil anything for you, but about midway through the movie, you grow a bit tired of the bedroom scenes. The ending is eventful, much better than the letdown that you get with the Blair Witch Project.

One more thing...it is somewhat annoying that the time is displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen and the activity happens in the upper-left. The clock often plays an integral role by showing you how time passes overnight, but you are forced to take your eyes off of either the activity or the clock at certain points. At times, you feel like you will miss something if you look down at the on-screen clock. It would have been nice if they were both located on the same side of the screen. Perhaps this is just an issue in the theaters and wouldn't be such a big deal at home?? Or perhaps this is a deliberate device used by the filmmakers to facilitate the shock factor when you are looking away at the on-screen clock and something occurs...

I watched this film in the theater early in the morning and by the time I went to bed, I was thoroughly afraid to sleep.  This film burns itself into your consciousness in a way no other film has.  I found myself thinking about it all day because the images it leaves in one's mind are so vivid.  At any moment, I expected to hear a loud bang or the lights to turn on in the hallway!

The good thing about it is it plays on your primal fears. It's not a ""blood and guts"" type horror film. If you watch it in a quiet and dark place, you will jump. I was at the movies and, during the movie, near the beginning, my cell phone vibrated in my pocket and scared the heck out of me, that's how tightly wound this movie keeps you. It's intense to watch as it has you strung up waiting for the next spooky thing to happen and the movie keeps building on that tension. You almost feel tired when the movie is over from being so tense and anxious the whole movie.

Yeah, it plays on the typical spooky tricks employed in most horror movies .. things jumping out at you, loud noises, etc. but it does so in a very good way. The story itself is interesting but not great. It's just a fun movie to watch with people. It will definitely spook you.

Either you will find the ""found footage"" and the way it tells the story terribly, terribly boring and you're going to laugh at the no effects and audio cues in the dark or you're going to look at it as your worst nightmare and freak.

Honestly, I wasn't sure how I was going to react to this movie. I think sometimes the concept works and sometimes it doesn't with Blair Witch Project being the prime example for the latter. Save for the last 10 minutes of that film, I found nothing about it scary and got irritated with the characters screaming at eachother. I suppose that's what the ""one star reviewer"" before me was feeling when they watched this film. But I felt like one of the main differences between this movie and that one was 1) the setting. Your home is supposed to be your safe place. The woods are something people usually get lost in. And 2) characters that you give a crap about. I just didn't care about anybody in Blair Witch and therefore, got irritated with their bickering. I kind of liked the characters in this movie, they were almost painfully normal and I think the filmmakers established the level of caring between them quite well. They just seemed like a normal couple who get hit with extraordinary, and extraordinarily bad, circumstances.

The main aspect that worked for me was the stationary camera in the bedroom. It made me nervous as hell. I felt like I was just waiting for something terrible to lunge out of the dark most of the time and sometimes, in its own way, it did. Only it wasn't overdone with CGI or Tom Savini effects. It was done with sound, slamming doors and the unseen. Personally, I've always been one who jumps at every noise at night when it breaks the silence, no matter how small. So this concept completely jived with what scares me.

Bottom line, this movie requires a lot of imagination and willingness to get to know the characters and their relationship. If you don't have the patience or the attention span for either of these things, you'll hate it. But if you get scared by things that go bump in the night and you wanna see something really scary, try to sit through this one alone with the lights out.",1259107200,9,2216,4.507462686567164

2) Too lazy to even make it look like the ""mockumentary"" it's tries to be. For example, a psychic visits the house and the first conversation between himself and the couple is shamelessly edited. I thought this was supposed to be ""found"" footage.

3) Scary? Absolutely not. It's about as scary as watching a handful of cute puppies playing with fluffy kittens. It reduces the audience to cheap parlor-house tricks: slamming doors, broken glass, and loud banging noises- yes- the kind of tripe you'll find at your local neighborhood haunted house, although this time, you'll be paying a lot more to see it.

Paramount honestly should've given everyone who went to see this tripe a complimentary gallon of vaseline - because that's how much you'll need to survive the relentless gangbang the studio gives the viewing public. I haven't the slightest doubt hundreds of interns and temp workers were hired for the sole purposes of promoting this film through the internet - targeting younger audiences through facebook, twitter and other social networking sites.

My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.

I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back.

The best part was that it was introduced to us as a whole through email (demand it) and face book along with other social networking tools.

3998663,5,B002VKE1K2,"Okay, I was wrong.

When The Blair Witch Project came out, the movie was suitably freaky. The ""what if"" premise was as much a part of the film's terror as the movie itself. Unfortunately, the hype was as artificial as the movie itself: friends of the producers spread rumors on the Internet that The Blair Witch Project was the scariest movie ever.  Sound familiar?

So you can understand my skepticism when Paranormal Activity released in a limited number of theaters, practically begging viewers on its web site to ask to see it.  The exclusivity was clearly meant to make people only want to see the movie even more.  Considering the numerous first-time posters on dozens of horror forums proclaiming it ""the scariest movie ever"" and...well, I didn't believe them.

I was wrong. Paranormal Activity, about a modern couple trying to survive a demonic haunting, does everything right.

* It takes the documentary medium a step further than Blair Witch, primarily used the style to make the film feel raw.  That unfiltered feel is also present in Paranormal Activity, but the film goes beyond that by playing with time stamps.  As the time stamp speeds up or slow down, the producers torque the tension.

* Never has a single open bedroom door been so disturbing. It conveys, by being open night after night, a sense of vulnerability, acts as a gateway between worlds, and symbolizes a violation of sanctuary. I couldn't take my eyes off the door the entire movie.

* Silence.  Paranormal Activity uses silence to freak out the audience.  Our own fears build and build in the vacuum of sound.  In fact, the silence was so deafening that the sound from the movies playing next door and the clicking of the film projector proved a distraction.  In that regard Paranormal Activity might be even scarier on a small screen.

* Whether it's propping up the false bravado of Micah or the dire predictions of The Psychic, there are no heroes here. And when someone a solution is finally identified as being capable of helping...it is tantalizingly out of reach.

This movie's plot isn't anything new. The same territory has been covered by The Haunting, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist. Paranormal Activity is simply a terrifying ghost story stripped down to its bare bones.

It may not be the scariest movie ever, but it comes damned close.",1258156800,3,2331,4.843434343434343

1) People with negative emotions towards a certain subject are naturally more driven to speak out about it.
2) It's perfectly natural for a movie of this type to divide the viewing public.

Whatever the reason for the negative reviews, I can speak from experience that this movie is well made and effective.

I am a fan of horror films/literature.  I don't consider myself an expert, but I've seen enough horror films and read enough horror novels to understand the genre.  This movie did not drive me to sleep with a light on, but then, it's hard to drive me to those measures.  This movie, though, DID creep me out.  It is very effective.

I saw it in a crowded theater, and while the audience did not react quite as dramatically as the audience in the trailer, there were many screams, and almost every person in the theater (with a pulse and/or an imagination) was visibly uneasy.

If you're not a fan of the horror genre, or you're not a fan of indy films, or you aren't blessed with a large imagination and a tolerance for the strange or different, this movie may not be for you.  If you buy into the hype too much, you're bound to be disappointed.

3998676,4,B002VKE1K2,"A well-written review of any film should never label its subject ""good"" or ""bad"".  Rather, it should give you an idea of whether or not you can expect to enjoy it, based on your own preferences and expectations.  Paranormal Activity is a particularly controversial film when it comes to the potency of its terror.  Most reviews either complain, with great disdain, ""I hated it - it wasn't scary at all"" or exclaim in total satisfaction, ""It scared the pants off me - I loved it"".  There seems to be little in-between.

I saw the film today, having read enough reviews to know pretty much what to expect.  But before I reveal my own reaction to Paranormal Activity, I would like to offer a few ideas that those who know little about this film may find helpful.

Alfred Hitchcock, the celebrated director who was known as ""The Master of Suspense"" held many interesting theories about what frightens an audience.  Hitchcock believed that, when properly stimulated, the viewer's imagination was far more powerful - and far scarier - than many direct images that may or may not frighten the average viewer.  Directly depicting a ghost, a monster or a demon for example, even with today's special effects, may scare many viewers, but that will depend solely on the quality of the effects.  And even if well done, many viewers may find the images unconvincing or downright laughable, for they may have other ideas about what a ghost, monster or demon should look like.

However, if the filmmaker merely implies that a supernatural event is taking place, and sets up the situation with enough skill, the viewer's imagination can take over and sometimes yield a far more frightening experience than any vivid imagery ever will.  After all, people go to horror films to be frightened, and what could be more frightening than unseen terrors from one's own imagination?  By setting the mood with dark rooms, low lighting, eerie shadows and other effects that many people will associate with their greatest fears, an innocent image of two people peacefully sleeping, unaware of what may be going on about them or to them, can become very frightening indeed, even if few special effects are used.  This is especially true if the moviegoer has developed enough empathy with the characters to place themselves in the same situation.

Many modern horror films rely on blood, gore and violence, with horrible creatures conjured up by special effects and vivid scenes involving battles with ugly demons or manic killers in order to provide thrills.  That can be a lot of fun, and certainly very scary.  But it can also be argued that, as CGI effects advance and become more vivid and frighteningly realistic, many viewers become inured to violence, blood and ""creatures"" while depending less and less on their own imagination, and in the process, they will sometimes forgo a far scarier experience.  I know that no special effect ever came close to my own nightmares, because my nightmares are stirred by the things I fear most, and not the things that I've been conditioned to find scary.  In short, no amount of vivid terrors can match the human imagination, provided that the imagination is properly stimulated.

Well, this is the basic idea behind Paranormal Activity.  Largely on a shoestring budget, the writers/director/actors of Paranormal Activity have managed to create an old-fashioned thriller that relies almost exclusively on the viewer's imagination.  Those who like their ""scary movies"" full of CGI, monsters, blood and violence are warned; you will probably be extremely disappointed.  But if you have enough respect for your own imagination, and can allow yourself to be frightened not by what you see, but what you think is there, you just may find Paranormal Activity to be every bit as frightening and well done as many people say it is.

By the way, I saw it with a friend.  He did not find it frightening at all.  On the other hand, I definitely expect to have trouble sleeping tonight.  Whether or not you will agree may depend on how effective your own imagination can be.

I'd think if they gave the same budget to a local Halloween haunted house pretty much anywhere in the country they could have made a better, scarier, film.

My only disappointment is that the way it was released made it not at all scary for me.  I'm sure the 4 inconsiderate jerks 2 rows up who complained about how bored they were and tried to be funny through the whole movie didn't help either.  I mean don't get me wrong I jumped and had several Holy moley exclamations and one cover my mouth in sheer OMG moment, but I was expecting to be scared the way I was after Blair Witch (I still refuse to go camping to this day).

This is a movie that in order to get the full effect you have to go in with no expectations, with as little knowledge about what you are about to see as possible.  The problem for me was that ever since I caught the first glimpse of this on line I wanted to see it and I read every article and watched every trailer I could find.  I wasn't lucky enough to be in a market to see this early.  I was able to see Blair Witch before they came out and said it wasn't real.  I actually waited through the credits just to see that little disclaimer at the end that says it was fictitious(sp?).

I give it 3.5 stars based on it being a really quality horror film with genuine scares throughout, but as far as it being marketed as the scariest movie ever made?  Not even close.  I think if they had just given it a wide release and didn't hype it to death I could have seen it without knowing much if anything about it and I probably would have lost some sleep over every little bump or step I heard in my apartment, but I didn't.  This has 5-star potential but just doesn't deliver on the lasting impression.  There was too much ""down time""  I found myself thinking ""He got the camera to record the strange things going on at night.  Why am I watching them eat breakfast and not even talking to eachother?""  There was never any sustained fright or tension.  There would be a really good tense scary moment at night and then 10 minutes of them complaining about not getting enough sleep or eating or Micah playing guitar or Katie and her friend making bead necklaces.  The night scene would get me worked up and a little jumpy and nervous but then time to relax and not worry about anything until they go to bed again and by that time I was completely relaxed and settled down again.

Over all I'd definately recommend seeing it if you want to see a well made documentary style horror movie, but don't expect to be scared out of your mind unless you've been living under a rock for the past few months.  And don't bother with the DVD/Blu-ray release unless you have a good surround sound system or if you are curious (as I am) about the other two endings they didn't use.",1257120000,,2748,4.227969348659004
3998681,3,B002VKE1K2,"I like to see the latest horror film at Halloween, the best of which in recent years has been ""The Ring""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000087RFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring (Full Screen Edition)</a>, the horrifying story of a girl buried in a well whose spirit comes back to haunt everyone. This was a mystery wrapped in a horror movie that ended cleverly with a way to exploit the inevitable sequel to come.

Another memorable film from recent Halloweenish releases was ""The Blair Witch Project""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, the film that kicked off the reality in filmmaking style that ""Paranormal Activity"" copies. Blair Witch was, by any standard, a monumental success. It reinvented the horror genre and was the first reality film that confused plenty of viewers into thinking the events in the movie may actually have happened. A cleverly-designed Web site was the only way to determine if it was real or just the movies.

Nothing about ""Paranormal Activity"" mimics the finer qualities of either of these predecessors from recent years. Like Blair Witch, this one takes place using a hand-held camera and is a cheapie made on the run by the filmmaker. The entire film takes place in a guy's home in San Diego.

The plot revolves around the guy and his live-in girlfriend, who has been followed by an evil spirit since a terrible event in her childhood years. She seeks the advice of professsionals to rid herself of the spirit, and the boyfriend sets up the camera in their bedroom to record any untoward activity that goes on at night. The camera becomes the focal point of the film, as it records everything that goes on in the house.

Spooky things do take place in this movie and sometimes they are effective. However, the movie takes at least an hour to really get going and, once it does, any horror film fan is going to guess what's going on through two clues the filmmaker's give about an hour into the movie. The action picks up after that but, since you already know how it's going to end, what's the point?

This movie is about average for its style, I'd say. There are some nice moments and the acting is OK throughout. It appears they worked from some kind of script since none of the actors stumble over lines or get tripped up wondering what they were supposed to say. The nighttime scenes that are meant to jar you into gooseflesh work only about half as well as Blair Witch, in part because of the confines of the house.

So chalk this up as another inspired attempt to scare the wits out of filmgoers at Halloween that missed the mark, in my view. It's a stylish attempt but one that needed more to go on the first hour to be effective and memorable. It also spoiled its own ending by giving that away in the final 30 minutes.",1257120000,2,2976,5.088114754098361

The video format, however, gives the story an immediacy and a verisimilitude that puts the viewer right into the story.  Events build slowly and culminate in one supremely creepy evening.  This film stayed with me longer than more spectacularly gory offerings.",1257120000,,798,5.007575757575758

3998704,2,B002VKE1K2,"I love the types of horror films that build up the suspense in a film. I love it when the only things you see & hear are slight shadows or knocking sounds. I liked the first Blair Witch film. So by all accounts, I really should've liked this film. But I didn't. I know that I'm going to get tons of negatives from this review because hey... some people don't like it when others don't share their viewpoints. (And I don't feel like I should have to write a fake review just to get people to agree with me.)

And if you are wondering, I generally don't like the films that are all blood & cheap spooks. I also didn't get a lot of the big media hoopla surrounding this film- the majority of what I'd heard about the film came from word of mouth from my friends & acquaintances. So it's not like I'm the type of person who only watches slasher films & it's not like I went into the film expecting this to be the 'Citizen Kane' of horror films.

The film follows Katie, a young student who has been followed around by an unseen presence since she was young. Her day trader boyfriend Micah treats her story with amusement & mostly disbelief. He decides to purchase a video camera & record the strange goings on that have started to happen in their ordinary home. As the nights progress, the occurrences become more & more pronounced.

I went into this film expecting to be entertained. I liked Blair Witch, so I figured that I'd be able to enjoy this film for the most part. I just didn't like most of the film. Why didn't I like it while so many others obviously did? Who knows? I saw this film with my mother, who describes herself as the most skittish person on earth & even she thought that this film was like watching paint dry on a wall.

The first thing that made me a little disinterested is that there's not a whole lot of personality to either Micah or Katie. We see them go about some daily activities, yet there's just not a whole lot of zing to them. I'm not expecting a Michael Bay explosion or for the lead actress to burst into the room wearing something out of a Victoria Secret's catalog, but I do expect slightly more than this. Perhaps that's why I just didn't connect with everything as much- I just really didn't care that overly much about the characters. I know that this was to show that they were normal people & to show their mental deterioration as the events escalated, but I just couldn't really get into either character.

The one thing I can say in defense of the film is that towards the end, the film did get better as the paranormal phenomenon got more pronounced & the script started picking up. The ending is pretty interesting, but it just didn't feel like it was worth sitting through the rest of the film for. It certainly wasn't worth the money it would cost to see in the theaters. The camera's shakiness wasn't as bad as it was in the Blair Witch film, but it still was bad enough to give me a pretty bad headache by the film's end.

But this is just my opinion. I've talked to a few people who really did enjoy this film & more power to them. I'm glad that they liked it. I just wish that I had. I was just incredibly bored by this film. I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch it, but I do recommend that most wait to see it when it comes out for rental with the alternate endings on it. (I'm assuming that they'll put them on the DVD, anyway.) In the meantime, I recommend some of the older classics out there such as 'The Changeling' & 'The Haunting' (the original one, not the remake). Those are films that build up the suspense slowly & really deliver. This film? I can safely say that I'll probably not rent it when it comes out or watch it again.",1257033600,4,3695,4.278969957081545
3998705,5,B002VKE1K2,"In an age when so many ""horror"" films rely on blood and gore in a sensory-overload attempt to scare people, ""Paranormal Activities"" stands way out from the crowd. It also goes to show that you don't need to spend millions of dollars or hire big names to make a bloody good film.

For people who have seen ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"", the style of movie will be familiar. It's a home-video style of shoot where the camera is being held by one of the two key players Micah and Katie or is placed on a tripod. Unlike either of the aforementioned movies, however, the camera control in this film is much better and there are few nausea-inducing moments that were more frequent in ""Cloverfield"". Also, the camera being on a tripod for a good part of the film helps keep things steady and allows you to concentrate on what is going on.

The story is quite simple. We start the film with Micah testing out his new video camera, purchased to try and record some weird things that have started happening at night in the couple's house. Katie has experience these ""happenings"" off-and-on since childhood and is scared. Micah thinks it's pretty cool and one gets the feeling that he's thinking ""reality show"" down the road.

The camera is placed in a corner of the room, the couple goes to sleep and...things start happening.

What is absolutely brilliant is that, whether you ""believe"" or not, you're sucked into the story and the action. Director Oren Peli doesn't beat you up with effects. He's taken the ""less is more"" approach that is so sorely lacking in 99% of current ""horror"" films and uses it, at first to give you goosebumps and, as the film progresses, scare the hell out of you. There are many scenes where the build up is worse than the fright. There is no music to let you know what's about to happen. This is, after all, ""home movie"", but what does happen us just plausible enough and, when mixed with the daytime interaction between Micah and Katie, that we end up thinking ""get out of the damn house"". Except they can't.

The only other actors in the film are a friend of Katie's who is really just ""there"" and a Psychic who tells the couple that they're not being haunted by ghosts but something he can't help them with...though he knows someone who can.

Anyway, without trying to give away too much, events get more freaky. The camera records a lot, sometimes fast-forwarding through the night until we get to an ""action"" scene. Peli uses the time indicator to excellent effect and one's eyes keep wandering to the lower right part of the screen, somewhat hoping that it's going to be dawn soon.

The ending is brilliant and perfect.

If you're looking for blood and gore, this isn't it. If you don't like the ""found footage"" style of movie, then this isn't for you either, though the way Peli has directed it makes it much easier to watch more believable that either ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"". There were parts of these films that left you thinking ""put the camera down, you can't have this conversation with a camera in hand"". In ""Paranormal"", the camera is put down, conversations happen out of frame, and all to good effect.

Using unknown actors in a film like this helps make it more believable. I couldn't believe some reports I read that Hollywood was considering a remake using ""named"" actors. The trouble is, they'd have ruined it because, for some reason, they feel the need to ""show"" rather than ""tell"". Movies such as ""The Haunting"" remake are very obvious proof of this.

I'm very glad this film was released ""as is"". It's surprisingly easy to suspend belief and get caught up in the atmosphere. I've never been so frightened, and I don't scare easily. Perhaps it was because of a theater full of people who gasped aloud when I did.

We all bought it for an hour and a half.

I hope that there are more true ""independent"" movies like this to come, where the art of film-making is not secondary to effects and big budgets.

3998706,3,B002VKE1K2,"This film is the definition of a ""slow build"" suspense film. Much like The Blair Witch Project, this is a movie filmed as if it were based on real events and shot with little production on a shoestring budget. There are only four people ever on screen; the characters are believable and the performances of the two leads, a couple who decide to film the strange ""paranormal activities"" going on in their house, really allow the audience to be sucked into their world. The only complaint is that this is still meant to be a horror film and the scares are few and far between. The ending, however, is absolutely fantastic.",1257033600,3,620,4.594594594594595
3998707,4,B002VKE1K2,"This movie had so much potential . . .
Here's where it went right and wrong:

RIGHT:
Overall storyline and concept is very good.
Micah offered great comical relief while at the same time antagonizing the demon.
Katie's agony and frustration over the whole experience was believable.
Good use of quiet thumps and BOOMS!
Generally slow, gradual build-up of suspense and tension. With each passing night you know it will only get worse.
Camera was jerky enough to seem realistic, but not *too* jerky. Fortunately at night the camera is stationary on a tripod.
A few good scenes that will make you wish you were a turtle or an ostrich with its head underground.
Little to no use of special effects.

WRONG:
Once again, the characters are stupid in response to the threat.
Not ""Scream-at-the-screen"" scary, as most of the terror depends on how vivid your imagination is.
Scarier things could have happened: The camera could have fallen over, blacking out the screen and paving the way for aural horror instead of visual.

OVERALL:
Instead of scaring me with ""Boo!"" this movie mostly made me go ""Boo-Hoo"", because although it does build suspense and tension really well, with a little bit of editing and common sense it could have been a whole lot better than it turned out.",1256860800,3,1268,4.807339449541284
3998708,2,B002VKE1K2,"I won't say this is a bad movie, or boring, but I will say to the people who are saying this is the scariest thing they have seen in years, and some even said ever... are you kidding me? There is nothing scary about this film, it's entertaining enough to keep you watching, but a few noises in the night and a door moving, or sounds played backwards to sound demonic isn't anything but old typical cheap tricks made in every other horror movie of the past. This one is just in a style that is shot on a home camera, so expect a Blair Witch type of thing; no music, no soundtrack, no edited footage like a normal movie. However, if you are someone who was scared by the likes of Horror House in 3D then this one may send shivers up your spine. However to an avid horror or thriller movie fan, you know going into this that NOTHING is based on a true story that ever happened in the real world, and know that the stories of this being based on a true story is a marketing scam for it to make money on a low budget film.

The visual effects in the movie are nothing special, so don't go in expecting to see some cool things happening and wondering how they did that? It's a very low budget film that was apparently made for about $11,000. The acting however is decent, there is very few actors in the whole movie, but the ones that are in it do a decent job of delivering the story and it's refreshing to see the leading lady isn't a stupid skinny bimbo who got the role cause she starved herself to death.

Overall I'm not saying to avoid the movie; I'm just saying, don't get your hopes up too high and believe the hype about it from those who rarely see a scary kind of movie. It's far from being in the top 100, even top 500 scariest movies of all time. It is a far cry from being the scariest movie since Poltergeist, even tho I disagree that one is the scariest of all time either, but for the time being, this is one of those movies that is currently in fashion to see, and it may do well when it's released on DVD, but I am expecting it to be remembered as just one of those films that got parodied to death. There is already is a large amount of spoofs on the web right now, and I expect Scary Movie 5 will be targeting this one heavily.",1256860800,9,2243,4.095454545454546
3998709,5,B002VKE1K2,"I just got back from watching this in the theater. I'm glad it wasn't as annoying an experience as watching
The Ring in the theater. Some people just ruin the whole ""horror at the movies"" experience for me. ANYWAY,
I love this movie! It's slow building, and it takes its time building up the tension and sense of atmospheric doom.
My favorite types of movies! I love slow horror over gory action-packed horror any day! I know a lot of people got
turned off from this movie because it was very slow and boring, but I thought the ""snail pace"" plot development just made
the grand finale all the more terrifying...I knew something VERY EVIL was about to happen, and when it did, I LITERALLY jumped back in the seat and SCREAMED! Believe the hype of this one. Don't expect a fast paced gory movie that keeps your attention every 5 minutes.
Go in and be PATIENT....FORCE YOURSELF through all the boring arguing and bickering and obnoxious behavior from Micah..lol...and
you WILL be REWARDED at the very end. After saying all that...this movie is still not bloody and gory. You have to use your imagination
to truly scare yourself silly. Just like The Blair Witch Project...suspense without the gore. I saw this knowing it was fake, and I still enjoyed it very much! The movie does NOT have to be based on real events to be terrifying. I still love The Blair Witch Project.
Paranormal Activity's actors did a wonderful job.

[SPOILERS]

Micah was so redonkulous. He sure did tick that demon off! By provoking it via name calling, threats, and the Ouija Board. And look what happened to him at the end! He got chewed up and spit back out by the very mad and vengeful demon. Don't provoke demons, people!
They can throw (or spit) your pathetic corpse clear across the room! I was actually ready for Micah to get what was coming to him.
He was so annoying.

In Conclusion, I would definatly recommend Paranormal Activity to anyone who enjoys slow paced horror that focuces on atmospheric moody suspence and dread over blood, gore, and carnage. Slow supernatural horror are my favorite type of horror films, and this one exceeded on all levels. Of course, if you are not patient and get bored easily, you will not enjoy this movie.  Peace, and Happy Halloween everyone!

Here's a quick rundown:

The Good

- The actors did a good job.
- There was a good funny scene, which was the only thing I remembered when I left the theater.

The Bad

- This movie wasn't scary at all. If you're one of those people who closes their eyes and covers their ears when watching horror movies, you might find this one scary...because you won't be able to see/hear that it's not!
- The movie was mostly boring. There was a little suspense, but not enough to make me care. I just wanted it to be over or for something interesting to happen. At least my first wish was granted. :)
- The ending. Could have been a lot better.

In conclusion, don't waste your money on this one. If you must see it, wait for the DVD and rent it.

Also: Blair Witch Project was better.",1256774400,5,953,4.174863387978142
3998711,3,B002VKE1K2,"I heard about this movie more than a year ago. I read about it in an independent filmmaker magazine. At the time the studio that bought the movie was thinking of shelving this flick and letting the director remake it as a mainstream horror film with a real budget. Thankfully they came to their senses and released it ""Blair Witch"" bare bones style aided by an underground marketing blitz. Obviously it worked as this $15,000 film is raking in the big bucks nationwide. I knew as soon as I read about this movie over a year ago that it had the makings of a Blair Witch type reception at the box office because people are deeply uninformed and can easily fall victim to the hype of real events or supposed true stories. The whole Blair Witch marketing scheme was based on lying to potential moviegoers and getting them to think that it was real footage of real events and real people died. Thankfully ""Paranormal Activity"" does not fall to such pathetic gimmicks in it's aim to make the big bucks.

I did not want to see this film until it was released on DVD but a friend that I had not seen in years suggested we attend a midnight screening of the movie. This was weeks before it opened nationwide. We waited for more than an hour in line, ( I have never waited for a movie before in my entire life and I'm a movie buff ), but the wait wasn't so bad as it gave us a chance to catch up and talk film. Upon entering the movie theater, it was packed wall to wall with people. I live in a well known college town so I knew immeadiately that the marketing gimmicks had worked and this movie was going to do blockbuster business when released coast to coast. The audience was full of drunks and stoners of all kinds. Films like this and Blair Witch should be watched in either of two ways... either with a bunch of drunks and stoners at a midnight screening or alone by yourself in an empty theater.

The film itself was exactly as I imagined it would be. Unpretentious, basic scares, very minimalistic design as ordained by budgetary concerns. I am a filmmaker myself and of course it's great to see a bare bones film like this succeed financially in a sea of disgusting mainstream slime like the ""Saw"" series. I was delighted that Paranormal Activity beat up on the latest Saw flick this past weekend at the box office. However, an underdog success story still does not make a good movie. This film is not even remotely scary, even though all the drunks and stoners kept jumping up at even the silliest scares! It was more about a communal atmosphere than a genuinely scary movie, which are very rare indeed.

The characters were your standard issue boring twenty somethings living together in unwedded bliss until a demonic presence begins to haunt their house. From then on all the horror cliches you known and are tired to death of start creeping into the movie. I couldn't wait for everyone to die. It's a long time coming. The film drags in the middle portion and we the viewers are never allowed outside of the house. This has nothing to do with the ridiculous plot device that the demon will follow the woman anywhere she goes. It has everything to do with the fact that the movie was made on the tightest of budgets and could only afford one location. Are these characters at all realistic? If a demonic presence was messing with you in your house, would you not skip at least a night or two in your home? Maybe go to a friend's house, hotel or something? Give me a break! Anyway, some of the effects shots were pretty sweet for such a low budget film.

How does this movie rank against ""The Blair Witch Project""? I really did not like Blair Witch upon it's release and I resented the fact that the marketing department had to lie to people to buy the product. I research things like this so of course I was not fooled but let me tell you... back in 1999 when Blair Witch came out, I was working in a video store and people came up to me all the time as they were renting Blair Witch and asked me, ""Is this for real? Did these people die?"" Yes, human beings are that gullible and idiotic and marketing people prey on that. After I watched Paranormal Activity, I went and saw Blair Witch again for the first time in a decade. I greatly enjoyed Blair Witch more the second time around without all the fuss. Blair Witch has a vital ingredient that horror films should absolutely have and that Paranormal Activity sorely lacks and that ingredient is atmosphere. Spending an hour and a half in a house with two idiots in their bedroom is far less atmospheric than a group of four trecking through the woods and getting lost for days. The location shooting is vital for Blair Witch, night time, daytime, surrounding the actors with nature and pitting them against the elements and the supernatural horrors around them. Plus that film not only had consumer grade camerawork but also 16mm black and white footage to give the film an artsy look. For my money, Blair Witch still keeps the crown for tiny budgeted horror films with over the top marketing hype! Paranormal Activity is an average boo and bump in the night flick. You won't miss much by waiting for the DVD release. Take care, movie fans!",1256774400,4,5196,4.460567823343848
3998712,1,B002VKE1K2,"Obviously most everybody knows that this movie has loads of hype behind it.  The commercials praised the fear-instilling nature of the film showing an audience jumping in fright.  Does it live up to the claims?  I went to the movie with my wife and we both expected it to be a flop.  Afterall, when there's loads of hype behind something it often times means it's going to be a joke.  Well, it wasn' a COMPLETE flop, but it wasn't scary at all.  My wife is a veteran horror fan and I'm a newbie horror fan.  Neither of us were scared once from this movie.  The sad part is that the only interesting part about the movie is the interactions between the two main characters which make for an interesting lesson in relationships.

The main characters are a boyfriend/girlfriend couple living together in the guy's house.  The film is completely viewed through the new camera the boyfriend purchased to hopefully catch footage of the alleged demon haunting his girlfriend.  It starts off extremely slow with some simple everyday activities of the couple, then they have a psychic come to their home to ask his advice.  The few ""scary"" scenes mostly occur while they are asleep in their room with the camera still rolling.  Unfortunately, nothing scary ever happens.  There's some weird stuff, but that's about it.  The only reason I didn't feel like I wasted my money was because 1) I didn't expect much of the movie in the first place, and 2) my curiosity was satisfied.

The audience we were sitting with clearly didn't think it was particularly scary either (apart from two girls who freaked out over EVERYTHING).  People were laughing rather than screaming, and nobody jumped like the commercials advertized.  The only part that really makes things interesting is the VERY END which still didn't do that much for me.  So, even if you don't go in with high expectations you MAY still be disappointed!  However, if you know you will like this kind of movie, go ahead and give it a shot.  Just because I didn't get anything out of it doesn't mean you won't.

The cast led by Katie Featherston (as Katie) & Micah Sloat (as Micah) is great! The directing and film editing by Oren Peli is excellent! The casting by Ricki Maslar is great!

Either way, though, Paranormal is a chilling movie that successfully raises one's hair. I liked that the scary scenes didn't totally dominate the film, so as to give more time to character development, which is something not appreciated by those who have short attention spans or for those who need a lot of action to compensate for bad acting.

Katie did a great job in drawing me into her emotional pain and physical discomfort. I really felt bad for her, and that's a good thing because if I don't care for the characters, then what's the point in sticking around. Katie's boyfriend, Micah, offered some good ideas and much needed scepticism to counterbalance Katie.

Even though I don't believe in spirits or the supernatural, this film made me pause and consider the ""possibilities."" It made me want to visit the local library and read up on those things that go bump in the night.

It's not one of the best I've seen only because it's one of the scariest, it's also one of the most realistic! The mix of realism, suspense and tension is just perfect!

A lot of people say that it's boring and I really don't get it. It's WAY too suspenseful to be boring. I've been trying to understand why the people that thought that it was boring went to see it since it was released. Why does someone who get bored easily go see a movie about a couple filming in their house? Why does someone who hated The Blair Witch Movie go see a similar movie? While we're at it, why does someone expect to be scared in a theater full of people? The fact that there are idiotic teens that can't stop talking and laughing 90% of the time doesn't help. Personally, I can't imagine finding a movie scary with 30 persons around me. I thought that the movie was scary (compared to most movies), but I watched it alone in the dark with an headset. The fact that I believe (or want to) in ghosts/demons helped as well. Actually, I can't imagine someone who doesn't believe in ghosts/demons finding a movie about them scary. What makes ghost/demons movies scary is the fact that maybe they exist.

Anyway, the first few minutes of the movie was the only time that I didn't feel uneasy! The atmosphere was simply creepy! Hell, even a few parts with nothing but the couple talking were creepy! I guess that it was the expectation that something really bad was going to happen. The movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and/or scary images and doesn't have any over-the-top scare, it's all about tension and suspense.

It's not for people who need action every 5 minute and over-the-top scares. It's not for people who take trailers seriously and go see movies with unrealistically high expectations. It's not for people who watch movies with a closed minded and try NOT to get scared.

Finally, if it wasn't hyped, it would be much more appreciated. Some people just HAVE to hate hyped movies. Some others are so naive that they believe the hype.

During the nights, Katie is plagued by nightmares and experiences a general feeling of dread; something that has been happening to her on and off since the age of eight. To ease his girlfriend's discomfort, but mainly to satisfy his own selfish curiosity and prove he is the alpha creature in the house, Micah procures a camera and begins to record their bedroom as they sleep. He also documents their daily conversations and frequent bickering about the unwanted guest. Is it a ghost, a demon, or the pervy kid next door? Whatever/whoever is after Katie, does not appreciate Micah's attempts at taking charge. Slowly, things begin to... take shape...

Paranormal Activity is the best case of BOO!'s I have experienced in a movie theater in over a decade.  With only a few brilliantly placed bumps, groans and innuendoes, the simple story fuels your own imagination to the point you are roasting in fear and tension. The entire film is shot with a hand held camera inside one house. Thankfully, there is little ""shakiness"", as the camera is either secured on a tripod or resting on a surface. Of the four actors involved, two appear on screen for mere minutes. All this adds to the viewer's feeling of isolation, entrapment and inescapable doom, fully justified by the ensuing events... Five star entertainment, no doubt! With that said, I believe this film is best appreciated at night, on a large screen, with a group of viewers (to feed of each others fears). I will be curious to see how it does on DVD. The action develops VERY slowly (purposefully so). If you have ADD, this may not be a film for you.

PS: I think by now, most know Paranormal Activity was made on a budget of $15,000. This further goes to prove that huge budgets can never substitute for true talent. I hope Mr. Peli (director, writer and editor) has a long and successful career.",1256256000,6,2187,4.6875
3998720,3,B002VKE1K2,"This movie is about a couple who have been experiencing weird noises during the night.  They use a video camera to capture anything out of the ordinary.  With each night, the noises are more apparent and things begin to happen even during the day.

It's surprising that a movie with such a low budget can be on level with movies that costs millions of dollars.

When the night scenes appear, it does build up a lot of suspense, as you never know what is going to happen.  It feels like you are there watching through the camera.  When the night scenes are over, however, the movie is very boring.

The ending provides a really big jump scare and then another quick scare that rounds out the movie pretty well. All in all it's not a terrible movie, but it is a bit arduous to get through it without being bored most of the time.",1256169600,6,827,4.3311688311688314
3998721,3,B002VKE1K2,"This movie is about a night invisible demon stalker. Young woman confides she has had previous experiences of paranormal activity in other circumstances at other locations, so this is not a haunted or possessed house story. Couple decide to catch the evil in action by letting the camera run at night when everyone is asleep in bed. There is an exploration of what the entity could be and how it is to be defined. But we never see it.  We do hear it and see it's trails, but the action is induced by the young couple and things that could easily be explained by effect work. There is no sighting of any kind, and the only clue is from an illustration in a book of research in demonology. The scares are there for those who want to be scared, but it does not drag you in, and unless you are in the mood, it probably will not scare you, whatever happens.
The concept is cool, but the filming looks staged rather than spontaneous true caught on tape photography we would hope. The major downfall is the lame ending, as if they didn't know how to end it, but give it one last bang by ultimate violence. The only thing that was slightly creepy to me was the demon tracks made in the night by powder carefully placed on the floor prior to sleeping.

Guys, I don't want to spoil anything for anybody, but this movie BLEW CHUNKS.  It was NOT scary; it was NOT creepy--even ""mildly"" as another reviewer put it.  It is a movie in the same vein as the original ""Blair Witch.""  I just think the hype got out on this movie BEFORE it was found out it was also a hoax.

Now, I will say that I found the acting very good and the few effects were pulled off very well.  It is rated ""R"" for language--and language ONLY.  Yet, you'll be surprised there's little of that, as well.  There is no gore, no ""body count"" to worry about, and no hockey-masked killer.  Unfortunately, it's all the time in between that will have you nodding off.  You wanna' talk silly:  these people lived in San Diego, CA, yet they would have you believe there's only ONE demonologist in southern California!  Hell; there's one on EVERY CORNER. When they finally decide it's time to get out of Dodge, they want the audience to feel it's too late.

And it was--too late for me or anyone else in the audience to give a hoot about this bomb of a movie.  All I read and heard about how everyone in the audience was freaked out, and ""good luck going to sleep tonight,"" and all that other hype is just that:  HYPE.  The ONLY thing that freaked me out about this movie was that it supposedly was shot over a 6-week period--and these two people NEVER changed their bed sheets!

Althought some ""hate"" this film, I think you need to go into it to be ENTERTAINED and not scared out of your mind, which certainly isn't going to happen.

It's VERY MUCH in the style of 1963's THE HAUNTING---sounds and suble things. No real ""cheat jump shocks""--a cat leaping up on a window, someone's arm touching someone's shoulder, closing the mirror or fridge door and the ""killer is there"" -- all the nonsense we've seen for years.

In a sea of pretty darn good horror movies over the last few years, Paranormal Activity is really nothing too special, other than that it is an American movie and that it is coming at audiences with the same combination of realism and mystery that another little-film-that-could did ten years ago;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>.  Not that the combination is particularly unique now or even ten years ago, it just appears that when it involves ghosts instead of for example zombies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B0013D8LA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Zombie-Diaries/dp/B001DJ7PU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Zombie Diaries</a>) or Belgian serial killers (1992's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Bites-Dog/dp/B00006FMCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man Bites Dog</a>), it makes a a lot of money considering its cost and gets a ton of mainstream attention.  This movies cost about $10,000 to make and has grossed over $30 million.

I saw Paranormal Activity Friday night and found it quite compelling, which if it wasn't the whole thing would've failed miserably.  The audience reactions were rumored to be quite positive, with some people screaming and peeing their pants and so forth, but the crowd around me was a little different.  In fact, given it was a packed theater and the film had previously only had limited release, I'm not too surprised.  Horror films are something you really have to want to enjoy, especially ones that require a more robust imagination like this one.  When it was in limited release the audience may have for the most part been seeking out the film because they are genre fans, but upon a wider release the casual movie-going riff-raff will see it, especially if it means showing their girlfriends that they ain't afraid of no ghosts.  Folks actually booed the film when I saw it and I even heard comments like ""I'm sorry but dude, that sucked"" and ""that wasn't scawy at all!"".  These are the same guys that will hold their bowels tightly when riding a roller-coaster, instead of throwing up their arms to accentuate the fun.  These are also the same idiots that will be seeing garbage like Saw VI in a few weeks, but I digress.

The film follows Micah and Katie, who have just moved in together.  Katie has experienced strange encounters her entire life and Micah, a laughably naive skeptic, documents their experience in their new home together.  In fact, Micah consistently antagonizes this ghostly force by shouting at it and even getting a Ouija board.  The activity itself gradually escalates as the film goes forward but there is far too much to give away, especially if you've found yourself enjoying movies like this in the past.

This is well done and uses almost all of the usual tools in the horror genre effectively with one notable exception; gore.  I understand the principal behind not using gore and maybe even why they wouldn't need it, but the movie does lend itself to moments where it could have been used very well. Nevertheless, this is still a very decent horror movie and is certainly creepy enough in flashes to recommend checking out.",1255910400,,3515,5.677480916030534
3998737,5,B002VKE1K2,"Great horror film. The only other theatrical screenings I've been to that were close to this are The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, & Alien.
This one starts slow, develops the characters well, and progessively gets more suspenseful until it ends with it's penultimate finale. Easily the best horror offering in the last 20 years. If you're into gore and blood like Saw and Hostel, you'll be disappointed. If you like an edge-of-your-seat thriller with excellent acting & direction, this is for you. Don't listen to the negative reviews by people that try to compare this to movies that scared them when they were children. This is the real deal for horror fans.",1255824000,6,669,4.929203539823009
3998738,3,B002VKE1K2,"Paranormal Activity is the perfect example of a film that is shown during Halloween and after its run, no one will remember it. A movie that doesn't stick with you and if you make the effort to go see it, then its just another way to spend Saturday evening.
There is nothing special about Paranormal Activity, you have your stupid stock horror character in Micah, played by Micah Sloat, who buys a camera to record strange events occuring at home.  Micah's use of filming his girlfriend Katie, played by Katie Featherston, by annoyingly having the camera right up in her face like an old MTV concert video, gets old quickly. Katie has a lot of patience to put up with be constantly filmed during such mundane activties such as brushing her teeth.  I never understood why Katie didn't punch Micah in the arm and turn off that damn camera.
Anyway, the camera is placed in the bedroom to record what happens each night. As can be expected in this type of film, doors shut by themselves, windows lock, lights turn on, footsteps are heard, and strange sounds occur. All elements of any haunted house movie. If you have ever seen one haunted house movie, then you are not really seeing anything different here. Nothing that adds to the genre.
A better example of a psychological, character driven Haunted House movie would be Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963) which does cause sleepless nights unlike Paranormal Activity.
This movie had a lot of potential to be entertaining or better, actually scary, but it just never gets there like the rollar coaster ride that starts out strong and fizzle out at the end.
The hauntings are caused by a demon who follows Katie from place to place and not a ghost bound to one location.  The whimpy psychic, Michael Bnyamin, makes this point when he shows up to find out why Micah and Katie are being haunted. He claims that he is not a demonologist so he can't really do anything. He's just a character giving information and he's not really effective combating the supernatural because its not really his job. Katie and Micah argue about calling a demonolgist to try to put a stop to demon activites and the demonologist never shows up.
That's my main problem with Paranormal Activites, there is no expert sent it to combat and fight the demon. This movie needs a Van Helsing or an Priest trained in exorcism to step in and actually do something about the problem.
Micah's lame attempts to fill that position through self education from demonology books and Internet information and trying to confront the demon through talking to it and shouting go nowhere. Micah never tries anything to battle the demon like holy water or any idea that might work. The demon has all the power and does whatever it wants to with Micah and Katie.  There is no specialist who does anything to try to stop it or information presented in the film to aid fighting the demon and forcing it to stop haunting the couple.
I won't spoil the ending, I will just say it was the best part of the whole drawn out experience and it probably caused the terrorfied high school kid, sitting in front of me, to wet himself. I haven't seen an auidence member jump like that in a long time.
If you have $9 to spend and you want to see something good with intelligent characters this Halloween, then go see Zombieland instead of Paranoraml Activity.
I really wish directors working today, would go back and research good horror movies that work and go see horror movies made in the 80's when these films actually worked and were made better.

3998739,1,B002VKE1K2,"Just saw this ""Blair Witch/Cloverfield/The Ring"" hybrid in a crowded theatre.  I heard no tears of people weeping.  No one ran from the theatre unable to witness anymore.  Instead there were laughs throughout the entire film coming from the whole audience.  And they weren't laughs to cover deeper fears. The sad and simply fact is that this is NOT a scarey movie at all!

The plot is trite, the actors obvious amateurs, the jolting scenes of terror are no more thrilling than going to a live Halloween scare-show and having a constumed employee jump out at you.

Hype has elevated this film higher than the recent Balloon Boy's hoaxed lift.  (There is even a scene in this film involving an attic crawlspace:  I hope law enforcement checks out to see if Richard Henne and his family saw this movie and got their idea for the hideout for Falcon and the hoax notion from it, as the film is prefaced with a caption indicating it is a true story - which it is not - just as the UFO balloon story was bogus.)

Don't fall for it:  Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" is 100 times spookier and scarey than this cinema verite garbage. The original ""Carnival of Souls"" is 100 times spookier and scarier. There are hundreds of  movies scarier than this - primarily because this movie just ain't scarey!  It has been so overly hyped that expectations will be naturally and unnaturally high, but the film is, alas, as empty as the balloon UFO once it came to earth.

I went into the theatre wishing to be truly frightened - and I, and the rest of the audience, found more to laugh at than to fear. A total waste of time.",1255824000,16,1602,4.482758620689655
3998740,5,B002VKE1K2,"That's a lesson the male character in this disturbing film learned just a little too late.

It's exceedingly rare that I see a horror movie that isn't god-awful bad, and less often still that I see one that I can say is excellent.  Paranormal Activity is one of those precious gems.  Virtually everything was done right:

1.) Gradually building sense of tension - the film starts out on a bright, sunny day, by introducing us to a pair of twenty-somethings that appears to have it all: money, good looks, a great house, expensive toys and even true love.  This cheery beginning gives way over the course of the story to uneasiness, foreboding, mounting fear and at last outright terror.  This is accomplished at a steady pace that is neither rushed nor deadly dull.

2.) Good character-building - before long you start to feel like you know this couple.  Not only that, but you can't help but like them, despite the boyfriend's general boneheadedness and his lady friend's mood swings.  You go inside their home, you see their personal belongings, and you experience a small taste of their daily routine.
Hence you are well primed to share in the overwhelming sense of horror that fills the climactic moments.

3.) Last but by no means least, ""Paranormal Activity"" makes splendid use of the ""less is more"" principle.
The demon that stalks this unfortunate pair is never actually seen.  It makes its presence known by crashing sounds in the middle of the night, by lights and appliances that switch themselves on and by disembodied shadows that glide along the walls of barely lit rooms.  What little use of special effects there is occurs at the exact moment it should, when the Thing from Hell makes its ultimate move.

This isn't a movie for those who can't imagine a horror film without chainsaws, buckets of gore and bad jokes.
The fear you'll experience is like that you felt as a kid, watching a late night monster flick or listening to a ghost story around a campfire.  It's the proverbial chill that creeps up your spine inch by inch, until that dark moment arrives when you turn around, and see that the monster you've created in your imagination is real, and is standing right behind you, its red eyes glowing in the dark.

Don't miss the chance to see this one in the theater.  Don't play with Oujia boards.  And if you're a guy who meets a cute brunette named Katie one night, you might want to think twice about asking her out.  She's got issues you don't want to deal with, trust me.",1255737600,17,2497,4.649202733485193
3998741,4,B002VKE1K2,"I couldn't avoid the massive hype before forking over my money to see the film that many called the scariest movie ever made. I sat down in my seat prepared to jump at least a few times before the end credits, but it only gave me one mild jolt at the very end. That's not say that Paranormal Activity isn't creepy, it really is. It's neat how a few loud noises or a flick of a light switch in the middle of the night (there are a few more elaborate gags than these as the film progresses) creates more tension than any big budget horror film in years. I got goosebumps a couple of times and the less is more approach (whether due the whopping $11,000 budget or not) made it much more unsettling. The Jaws rule of the less you see, the scarier it is, definitely applies here. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project make sense. They are both horror films, shot dirt cheap (though Blair Witch had twice the budget) and have the same documentary like style. Only in this case, I was happy to find none of those frantic camera movements that made so many people want to hurl leaving the theater back in 1999. The two main cast members are unknown, but they were much better than expected. The dude got on my nerves a little at times and the arguing got tiresome in between the night scares, but they were successful in seeming like real people documenting the paranormal, not actors.

Paranormal Activity is slow moving, especially the first half, and it doesn't live up to the hype, but I envy those who just recently heard about this little movie. I saw it with a small crowd and I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable with a packed theater (unless it's full of stupid teens laughing at everything). I liked it quite an bit and unlike The Blair Witch Project, I can see this one becoming a minor classic.",1255737600,,1805,4.388059701492537
3998742,2,B002VKE1K2,"Where to begin, where to begin. My first question is since we voted Paranormal Activity into a wide release in theaters, is there a way that we can vote it out? I haven't felt this let down by a film in a very long time. We're talking let down by epic proportions. I was so completely disappointed, I almost wanted to stand outside the theater door and warn people going in to save their money, don't believe the hype, go trade your ticket in for Zombieland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but wait a week and go see Saw VI. It has too be more entertaining than this.

Before I go on, let me get the one good thing about this movie out of the way. It won't take long, believe me. The movie does serve as a warning to people to not mess with the supernatural and occult which, in my opinion, is a very good position to take on the subject. A lot of movies make it look fun to play around with the occult and such, but this is definitely not one of them.

Now, on to the rest of the film. I guess I'll just start from the top and move down the list. I may have to abridge some of this since if I actually went into what all is wrong with this movie, I would have to start another website. We begin with the filming technique. The shaky cam is something that was first used as a horror gimmick for film in The Blair Witch Project. This film wishes it was The Blair Witch Project. Never mind the comparisons - it truly WANTS to be that film. I'm over it. Done with the shaky cam crap. I'm tired of leaving the theater feeling like I want to go blow chunks on the director. It was cool the first time. But to keep making movies like this for me to watch is like asking me to keep riding that rollercoaster that I know is going to make me want to barf half-way through it.

I don't know why Oren Peli is being praised for this thing. All he did was walk around with a video camera and shoot stuff. There is nothing even remotely artistic about this. You set a camera up in the corner of a room. People get in bed and out of bed. You use some cheap parlor tricks to make doors move and have somebody downstairs banging stuff. Wow. Now that is art. The rest of it is shot like a home movie, just focusing on a room or a certain person.

What you get with this film is 20 minutes of footage that has some very quick scares and then 50 minutes of people talking about what's going on. Honestly, I would have felt better and been more entertained if they would have just released the 20 minutes of bed footage and been done with it.

Scariest movie ever or of the year? I think not. This entire film is made up of cheap thrills and loud bumps to make you jump. It's like that bad remake or rip-off of The Exorcist you accidentally rented off of Netflix last week. The only people who will be scared from watching this movie are moviegoers who are completely unfamiliar with horror films and do not go see them regularly. I mean real regularly. There's no way if you've watched even two scary movies this year that this thing would get more than a cheap momentary jump out of you.

Paramount and everyone involved in this thing has done quite a number on the public. It makes me wonder if this wasn't planned from the very beginning. That it was somehow orchestrated from the get-go. All I can say, I got taken. If you don't feel like you've gotten taken when leaving the theater after seeing this, then they've truly done a number on you. I walked out not believing that renowned websites that I rely on for my movie news have actually been promoting this thing as truly scary and brilliant. Has everyone bought into a big lie? Not me. I do have to applaud Oren Peli, though. He has somehow taken an $11,000 heap of film project and used it to rise to the stature as of being the director of The Blair Witch Project of the 21st century. We saw how well that panned out for the original directors of that film.",1255737600,9,3900,4.172642762284196
3998743,5,B002VKE1K2,"The entire film was made using a budget of roughly $11,000. Almost all 86 minutes of the film take place inside one room of the house. It consists mostly of one camera position the entire time. 95% of the film consists of just two actors, one of whom has only one previous film to their name, and the other has none. And more or less, this is a just ghost story. Everything about this movie is simple and seems like it could have been made by just about anyone. And therein lies its brilliance; using a minimalist approach and a slow, yet deliberate pace, Paranormal Activity is a stunningly effective horror film that makes watching two people sleeping in a dark room some of the most suspenseful and terrifying moments you will ever experience while watching a movie.

  What makes this film so effective are the two main characters, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat). Everything from their conversations, to their facial expressions, and their body movements are so perfectly executed and believable that it makes us think this might be actual footage we are watching. You become emotionally invested in them (specifically Katie) that you can actually feel their sense of paranoia escalating throughout the whole film. They have no idea what is going to happen next, and neither do we.

  The premise of the film is very simple--Katie has been being haunted on and off since she was a little girl by what she believes to be a ghost. Moving into a new house with her boyfriend Micah, these ""hauntings"" start up again. Her boyfriend, not having known about this when they moved in together, becomes excited at first about the whole thing and wants to investigate it more. He goes out and buys a video camera and sets it up stationary on a tripod in their bedroom while they sleep in hopes of catching something, if anything on tape.

  One of the best things about this movie, and why you should see it at least once in theaters, is the audience and their growing sense of fear throughout the film. You could literally feel the tension in the movie theatre. As the days go by, the hauntings get worse. Each time the night footage started, you could hear nearly everyone in their audience rustling their seats, anxious and terrified about what might happen next. By the last two nighttime footages are playing, people in the audience were screaming before anything even happened. The film does an excellent job of playing on human being's fear of the dark and of the unknown.

  For being a horror film, up until the last scene, there is almost no violence at all. It uses atmosphere, setting, and mood to build up tension throughout the film.  It also does a great job of not showing too much on camera and letting the audience try guess for themselves what exactly is happening. In fact, one of the most frightening parts of the movies is a scene in which neither character can be seen on camera, but only their voices and movements can be heard coming from downstairs. With that, some people may not enjoy the slower pace and lack of violence and may be turned off when they see this.  Regardless, the last 20 minutes alone should be enough frighten those with even the thickest of skin.

  It is a movie like no-other and undoubtedly one of the best horror films to come along in years. Time will tell, but in my opinion, this could eventually be tagged alongside the likes of The Exorcist and Poltergeist as one of the scariest movies of all time. Once you see this, the creaking of floorboards and the droning of pipes at night may never sound the same.

In watching (most of) it again, I can certainly see a lot of irritating weaknesses (that I'll not discuss as they would be spoilers) that hadn't really bothered me as much as the first time I saw it. It's worth watching.",1525564800,,330,4.338709677419355

8382253,2,B002VKE1K2,"Hey lets use our house in the mid west.
Hey let pretend the house is haunted.
Hey Ill spend half a days pay on an oversized camera , so it looks professional.
Hey lets forget to use a time stamp and then add it in 7 minutes in and hope no one notices, oh poop its a digital time stamp and looks really fake... oh poop just keep it.
Hey lets make sure we edit the film so its super obvious the camera placement and the scenes are obviously not real or continuous.  Any one for a pool party? reel me in a finger from the middle.  Wow, pretty lame for a day trader.  I say we short this guy.
Hey honey you come to me at my computer and ask about a psychic and I will make fun of the notion, even though I believe in paranormal activity?  But  we need filler and neither of  us are good actors.

Man the hard cuts are so off putting you might actually like this garbage.

Painful to watch. This is the equivalent of a day time soap opera.  You know its fake, but for the fans, they really want to believe or its just a guilty pleasure...right Mike Stoklasa?

I shut it off after 20 minutes, it made me feel like the mental  equivalent of a Kardashian.",1525219200,,1147,4.030973451327434
