4712679,3,B005JH54NM,"Entertaining (in an artsy, boring, French kind of way), but ultimately forgettable story of a sexually curious 14 year-old girl who is home from school for a month. Her parents live way back in the country side. So bored with nothing to do she lays around half-naked and fantasizes about sex.

Wait!!! Don't get too excited just yet. Yea, that might sound like a set up for the hottest movie ever made, but unfortunately this girl's fantasies suck and not in a good way but in a mid-70's, unshaved, artistic kind of way. Tied up spread eagle on the beach some sickly chain smoking dude rubs earthworms on her private parts (yuck), her overweight father watches television with his wang hanging out (barf), the girl rams bird feathers up her bum and crawls around on all fours (huh?), hey, I feel like cramming a spoon in my [...] (what?). I don't get it. I just don't understand the meaning/symbolism of somebody puking all over herself then not even cleaning it up, but writing in her diary instead.

If you're looking for something artistic and hot then skip this dog and check out BELLE DE JOUR or maybe some Radley Metzger flicks.",1125705600,249,1134,4.63681592039801
4712680,1,B005JH54NM,First of all this movie's origional content is from the 70's and has terrible resouloution. The movie it self is in french with subtitles. This movie is very disgusting and the sex is so gross it makes you want to turn it off and never watch it again! I think I am permanently scared from theses images I cant get out of my head.

4712681,4,B005JH54NM,"All of us have gone though this phase on our journey from childhood to adulthood and few will forget it.  It is mysterious, puzzling, dazzling, intimidating, wondrous, discomforting, frightening, joyous, rebellious, moody and frustrating.  Its feelings -- often denied -- devolve deeply on the sensual awakening of our intimate body parts, but most film producer's skirt this issue; they don't want to show it.  Instead, they depict a series of mindless scenes that merely imply a connection between the emotional and physical being.
What's refreshing in this film, is that the director, Catherine Breillat, had the courage to show the anatomical elements involved in this living paradigm.  The story jumps around a bit with a few inane scenes such as the details of slaughtering a chicken for dinner (a common occurrence on farms).  However, the main character, Alice (played by Charlotte Alexandra) hues to the story line and is ultimately relieved to find that she too has made the awesome leap into an attractive adult, one who is capable of bringing about a successful sexual experience.
My only criticism of the film is the very poor quality of the DVD imaging.",1017446400,145,1167,5.0890052356020945
4712682,3,B005JH54NM,"...There are obvious places along the story that are rough (script, acting, and cinematography) but again, it is Breillat's first film and it is 100% French. I didn't find the sexuality quite as shocking ...I found it very honestly courageous. There is actually very little nudity in the film and, other than one very openly sexual scene and a couple of exposed penis scenes, there's no more nudity than would be normal for any European film of that period. If you have seen either of Breillat's most recent films (Romance & Fat Girl) and were intrigued, then this film is worth viewing (or collecting) as the first step in the development of Breillat as a film maker...",1015459200,25,670,4.735042735042735
4712683,2,B005JH54NM,"In 36 Fillette, Catherine Breillat sensitively examined a young woman's sexual awakening and withheld her signature graphic details, resulting in one of her best films.  In A Real Young Girl, all the nudity (quite extreme), dirty cinematography and voice-over can't help alleviate a sense that we're watching something voyeuristic and exploitative of its central character.
I admire lead actress Charlotte Alexandra for her boldness, but really, is all the explicit baring of body parts necessary?  The ""story"" is a typically contrived one for the Breillat oeuvre, filled with dream sequences and introspection, and as in Romance, Breillat's excessive use of voice-over serves to hinder rather than help our understanding of the main character.  It's never all that illuminating to hear a character talk about how s/he feels rather than see it, and the shallowness of the writing only makes the lead character all the less interesting.  In fact, I suspect the script may have lifted passages from Breillat's novel verbatim, because most of this movie feels like a bad book adaptation, unable to tap into what makes movies different from novels.
This was the first Breillat film I've seen that fails to move me in any way.  Intellectual, voyeuristic and very writerly, A Real Young Girl is strictly for the Breillat completist.  Good thing, then, that her filmmaking has progressed.",1015113600,36,1381,5.254545454545455

4712685,2,B005JH54NM,"Artsy French erotic drama is watchable but ultimately not very interesting and, worse, not very stimulating.  A young heroine, home for the summer from boarding school, is soon bored hanging around her parents' farmhouse and starts having all manner of erotic dreams.  As the film progresses, we see a mix of erotic dreams and actual erotic events, with the film leaving it up to the viewer which events are happening in the girl's head and which are actually taking place in her life.  Toward the end, it's pretty clear that most of the events are actually happening.  The trouble is, most of the girl's erotic dreams and/or experiences involve things like having earthworms rubbed into her nether regions and the girl playing with earwax, hardly the elements of classic erotica.  There are other things going on, and the movie's not a total loss, but really... if you've seen one allegorical French erotic drama, you've seen them all.",1165276800,6,936,4.936305732484076
4712686,3,B005JH54NM,"A conclusion is where you let your mind stop thinking.  This isn't a movie I'd have been comfortfortable watching next to my mother-inlaw in a theater.  It's a film that gives you something to think about and remember your own rights of passage.

Art isn't supposed to avoid offending you. It's supposed to make you think and feel in ways you haven't before.  Don't just think about the earthworms or bird feathers and then just stop thinking.  Think about yourself at that time of life and the things you did when you were curious or in wonder.",1161907200,5,545,4.577319587628866
4712687,3,B005JH54NM,"The director of this film, Catherine Breillat, is one of the greatest filmmakers working today.  Her films are blazingly sexual, and she is not afraid to show what other directors (especially American ones) would never even think of showing, both in images and dialogue.  Her films are very cynical and bleak, and neither sex is spared from her eyes.  However, this film is not one of her best.  It's a bit pretentious, overly artsy, but still interesting.  It was her first film, and generally, it's not very good, but you can see the themes of her later work (which is superior).  If you want great Breillat work, try Fat Girl, Romance, Anatomy of Hell, and Sex is Comedy.",1145145600,19,674,4.669491525423729

4712689,2,B005JH54NM,"Another Catherine Breillart examination of a weird-ass French chick.  I have a hunch that is a description of the writer/director herself.  At any rate, the real interest became a guessing game as to what inanimate object the heroine would insert in herself next.  A trying and boring distillation of everything that is absurd and exasperating with introspective, obsessive intellectualism. The young lady is lovely, and I hope she found better material for herself in her later career.

Whenever I am exposed to one of these extravaganzas of repulsive people doing shocking things, I always think of Elliot Gould as the photographer in Little Murders, who is embraced and lionized by the intelligencia when he starts photographing dog poo on the streets of New York.  And why not?  Isn't it nature?  Doesn't it symbolize and comment on the way we live? Yeah, right. Have fun.",1141603200,16,876,5.041666666666667

4712691,1,B005JH54NM,"I bought this movie because of Charlotte Alexandra. I had seen her in a really good movie with Charlotte Rampling called ""The Pool."" She was beautiful to watch and played well against one of my favorite actresses, Charlotte Rampling.

""A Real Young Girl"" on DVD was of low quality and didn't make sense to me. I can not recommend it. Some scenes were just gross. It was not even a little sexy. It was sophomoric.

I did follow Amazon's suggestion and also bought two other movies; ""Romance"" & ""Frivolous Lola."" ""Romance"" was good but a little dis-jointed and needlessly explicit in some parts and not explicit enough in other parts. The other characters were flat and empty.

""Frivolous Lola"" was hilarious, explicit, sexy, and fun even if it was a little dated. I will see this movie again with friends just to laugh.",1138665600,29,818,4.706293706293707
4712692,3,B005JH54NM,"...and social complacency, the search for sexual self and identity, class identity and conflict, the inescapable power transfers and compromises involved first in love then in (loveless) marriage, the ugly transition from the innocence of childhood to the enduring pain of adulthood, the slow death endured in relationships, ownership and possession, longing for self-worth, the fragility of life and love . . . well, you get the picture.

Though unrated, I'd argue this film is a tad beyond NC-17, but most definitely not XXX.  There are a couple of scenes with graphic nudity and explicit sexual contact.  These scenes are not overly long, but they do more or less come out of nowhere.

And lots fluids.  Use your imagination, and just about all of it's there, representative of simple physical being, our closeness to the animals, inescapable human coarseness and baseness, the crass, simple and arguably revolting circumstances in which life originates.

The symbolism was great throughout.  There's the horribly cracked coffee pot in the opening homecoming scene, with Mamere and her private, oversized cup.  I liked the interminable flies, everywhere, in everything, dying their quietly buzzing, horrible death on the fly strip above the dining table, a vile distraction and nuisance, but something inevitable, something to be endured, just like Mom and Dad's marriage, the crushing burden of adulthood, etc.  I especially liked the chicken scene, with mother and daughter bonding immediately, silently, both smiling in pure bliss as they cooperate to kill the cock, draining his blood into the cup with ""Momma"" on it.  Then pulling the feathers off gleefully, and feeding the vile entrails to the other hens in the yard, who greedily and without the slightest remorse gobble him right on down, squabbling over the parts.

I couldn't help but think that if this real young girl were acting like this today, she'd be trucked off to a special needs facility and medicated to the hilt, labeled self-destructive, probably manic-depressive, most definitely emotionally disturbed.  Through 21st century lenses, she's obviously clinical, in need of swift and intense professional help.  I guess back in the 1950s setting, even in 1975 when this was made, she still could just be precocious, frivolous, and immature.

The casting couldn't have been better, especially lead Charlotte Alexandra, who very much looked the part of a ripening schoolgirl, at once a pouty little kid and with a turn of the head or cant of the hip, a startling man-eater.  The casting was spot-on for the parents as well, right down to the apathetic driver and the snide shopkeeper.  While the casting was good, I found a number of the characters stock and predictable, except for the laughable 50s Vespa hoodlums, with their ridiculous hair and poseur biker jackets.

Right from the opening, the music is powerful, if overdone.  The overly loud opening song clearly sets the tone, despite the trite lyrics.  The yowling blues tune spewed by the heroin-thin singer on the TV was so overdone, both in the arrangement, tone, and his awful lip-syncing, that its effect was more comical than the intended erotic.  Some of the incidental music I couldn't help but think sounded an awful lot like Mark Mothersbaugh's incidental music most recently featured in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  I found those pieces much more well woven into the story, and much more effective in communicating motive and atmosphere, holding the film together.  The dubbing was atrocious throughout the film.  Yes, this film is subtitled, but the French dubbing, especially the re-recorded dialog was quite bad, sloppy.

And the actual film itself.  What struck me was just how bad the film stock was, how atrociously washed out a great deal of the exterior shots were, orangey-yellow, almost sepia.  It looks like a bad can or two of film, or bad developing.  I'm assuming this wasn't cinematic effect, given the inconsistent application and contexts in which a sepia-tinged view just didn't make sense.

And naturally, like any French film centered in sex, the ending is abrupt and final, with a violent death.  Ah, oui, that's the dichotomy, the unending tension, the delicious erotic similarity between petit mort and grande mort, right?

Bottom line:  If you're nuts for unpredictable, 70s Euro-experimental artiste cinema with healthy doses of dream, fantasy, raw nudity and overly artsy and confrontational sexual content, this will work for you.  This film is a good one to demonstrate your viewing diversity, a throwaway line for a future cocktail party.  But if you'd prefer a more linear story line with clear characterizations, a smoother production, defined boundaries between the real and imagined, and direct narrative paths, this film will grate.",1137456000,11,4815,5.1875808538163
4712693,2,B005JH54NM,"Technical stuff first - the movie was filmed in 1976 and set in the early '60s.  The writer/director's second film, it seems to be a commentary on the mixed emotions an adolescent girl has about her blossoming sexuality.  Only released in French with English subtitles an option on the DVD.

The acting is remarkably wooden with very stilted dialog - the frequent voiceover is essential to give story to the audience, and it still leaves much of the plot murky.  The cinematography is not awful - about what one could expect from a fairly new director in France in the mid-70s.

The amount of nudity, some pretty explicit, is going to shock people, particularly since it's done by an actress who is portraying a teen.  Her appearance (young 20s) is explained in voiceover, when she comments that she's very well-developed for her age.

So far, not so shocking - but this is one disturbed girl.  Walking about with her ankles hobbled by her underwear, performing autoeroticism with a spoon while at a meal with her parents, wearing her vomit to write in her diary - these early scenes are a mere warmup.  The earthworm, pulled to pieces and dropped onto or rubbed over her vagina while she's bound spreadeagle with barbed wire in a fantasy sequence underlines the disgust the protaganist feels toward herself.

This appears to be a statement from a facet of feminism that bewails the awfulness of being female - something that usually does not appear in real people until after the very late teens.

There are some ""real"" scenes in this movie, but Mme. Breillat's overstatement and drive to shock makes it a story well worth skipping.  I understand that her later work is much better and more accessable.",1136764800,11,1703,4.774744027303754

8475699,1,B005JH54NM,"I don't know what it is with Catherine Breillat's films, but they don't make any sense. If the lead role was supposed to be a Real Young Girl i.e. under 14 or 15 then the should have picked someone else to play the part. Okay her face said she was young, but she had the body of a woman. I think Catherine Breillat added some of the scenes for pure titilation. I mean if you want to show a woman's genitals, why have some guy cutting up worms and putting them inside her? The scene where her father was sat with his flaccid penis showing was supposed to indicate what? That he had incestuous feelings for his daughter? If that was the case, why didn't he do something when she was sat on his lap. If you purchase this film for pure titilation, forget it. I only paid $28, some others are being offered for 3 and 4 times that. If I had paid that much I would have been sorely disappointed.

Her sexuality is starting to emerge as she focuses on inserting objects inside her and experimenting with her bodily fluids as disgust provides a lucid moment during her moments of anger, frustration, and confusion.

8475703,5,B005JH54NM,"I never write reviews, in fact this is my first one and I felt highly compelled to write one after reading all the negative reviews.
First off this is not a porn, and is not suppose to be a ""hot"" movie. The movie was made in 1975 and was not released commercially  until 2000 or 2001 because of the nudity and sexual content.

The story takes place in the early 1960's and is based around the character, Alice. A 14 year-old girl  who comes home to a seemingly small provincial town from boarding school for summer vacation. Trapped in her small town she begins to lust after a new employee at her fathers sawmill. The whole movie is narrated by Alice and automatically we are taken into her head where reality and fantasy become blurred in a very honest, courageous movie of a sexual coming of age.

This is probably one of my favorite depictions of a young girl with an obvious and normal distain for society, her parents and what is ""sexual acceptable""; which she is just yet figuring out. While watching it is hard to tell what is in her head and what is actually happening in her life. An intelligent viewer will appreciate the ambiguity. An intelligent viewer will also realize that this movie was not made to shock and is actually a very real account of a young girl going through her sexual revolution as raw and ""disturbing"" as some may find it.

I highly recommend this film for any true film lover. And for the lot male or female who are completely tired of male dominated ideas of what is sex, sexy, real, disturbing, disgusting and abnormal. After reading the negative reviews I realized they were mostly written by men which is something to be said being a women and watching the movie made by a woman about a girl on the verge of womanhood.

8475704,5,B005JH54NM,I was hesitant to purchase this DVD film based on some of the negative reviews here. I mean I already know that some of Breillat's films can be pretty dull such as Fillette 36. I don't think this is the case with A real young girl. You have to remember that this is a Breillat film and a French film as well. Combine those two elements and you'll get one kinky film. I wasn't bored from beginning to end. I felt the movie had something insightful to offer. If you're a fan of this woman's work then please by all means buy this!,1232150400,,528,4.135922330097087
8475705,4,B005JH54NM,"At first, I really didn't know what to make of this movie.  It was literally hidden for twenty-five years after it was first released until it came out on DVD about 2002.  The first thing I need to say is that it was written and directed by a woman, so it isn't some dirty old man's fantasies.  Also, this is the most explicit movie you are likely to see in what is considered 'legitimate' (i.e., not porn) movies.  Within the first fifteen minutes Alice's pubic area is seen, and in later scenes she is seen urinating on the toilet, her fantasy boyfriend tries to push a worm up her [...] (spreading apart the labia majora), and later much of her genitals are seen as she exposes herself to the young man.  Nothing is left to the imagination.  I think most of the movie deals with Alice's fantasies; e.g. the scene with the worms has a parallel to sexual intercourse, but in her mind it would be less intrusive than the reality.

That said, in a way I can see why Alice would have such explicit sexual fantasies if for no other reason than to escape the emotional abuse her bitter, grouchy mother heaps upon her.  Why she turns to sexual fantasies is not clear. Maybe it is because of her father's abnormal sexual behavior.  At fourteen, she probably would have fantasized more romantic situations, but by seventeen she might have been more concerned with the physical aspects of sex, with the actuality ever more closer, so that rings true.  Still, to Alice, sex is something 'out there' and she can't really relate to the reality of sexual activity.  Touching is something she can understand because she can touch herself, but intercourse involves partially abandoning oneself to another, and this is a barrier she is trying to comprehend.  When she finally is actually with the young man, and he wants sex, she is faced with the physical reality of sex, and it isn't anything like she fantasized.  So, she resists, at least at first.

Men would probably be most interested in the exposure of female body parts only extremely rarely seen in cinema (other than pornography).  I would be interested to know just how common Alice's 'coming-of-age' is for most women.  It seems that Alice was completely oblivious to the love element (maybe because she doesn't feel loved at home?), which I  think would be the key for most girls her age to make sense of the reality demanded by their sexual urges.  For obvious reasons, this French movie isn't easy to find, and it certainly is not a movie for kids.  I think it would be of most interest to sexologists and psychologists who deal with adolescent sexuality as one small part of their library.",1198022400,3,2641,4.640860215053763
