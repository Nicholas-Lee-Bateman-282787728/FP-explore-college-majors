6202052,2,B00HRYH64A,Fields of the Dead is a low budget horror with a fairly thin (and often confusing) story line. What they did get right for the most part was the character interactions and dialogue (non-horror moments). Even the big budget films often have trouble with having lines ring true and come out naturally. FotD does a good job there and has some funny lines/scenes that keep it just this side of worth a watch.,1402963200,8,404,4.5479452054794525
6202053,4,B00HRYH64A,"While its a definately a no budget film, Fields of the dead is quite enjoyable. The story revolves around a group of college kids going to a haunted farm where one of them finds a women's diary. while reading the diary he learns of her having another man's baby which leads to murder. while entertaining, The film can be confusing at times and leaves u with unanswered questions. In closing, Fields of the dead is worth a look and I'm glad i purchased it. Thanx for reading.",1396656000,12,474,4.459770114942529
6202054,2,B00HRYH64A,"""The Wretched"" from 2008 is being recycled through Redbox/Amazon as a 2014 film ""Fields of the Dead."" A group of college kids working on a ""Thesis Project"" camp out on some haunted land. They find a book as one in the party become a possessed killer with a slight twist that didn't make any sense nor did the diary and its connection to anything. They tried to cram too much into the background.

What was good was the characters and the occasional campy dialog. In the beginning I had to laugh at the song lyrics...""Baby I wrote this song for you, F***ya, just you."" It was fairy lame, but the girl considered it sweet that he wrote a song for her.

The film also had a funny pot scene. At some point the dialog hit a rut and the rest of the film didn't have enough punch to carry it through. Too many slow scenes.

I was cracking up when the college student found the paper bound journal, written in the 1800's under a corn stalk without any covering or protection, as if it could have survived the elements for hundreds of years. I thought there was going to be a lesbian love story (which admittedly, would have added an extra star for me) but even with all of the hinting, never came to fruition.

6202092,2,B00HRYH64A,"One of the standard plot formulas for horror movies.  Nothing remarkable and nothing surprising.  The plot is a bit confusing, though.  Probably some of the story transitions ended up on the cutting room floor.  Certainly, however, it's better than a lot of other movies and that keeps it from getting 1 star.  And there's some potential here- the actors all did pretty good jobs.  They're rough in a couple of spots, but for the most part the acting is good.  The writing has some potential as well- the dialogue is good for the most part.  Maybe the people involved with this flick will improve their next movies.

I commend the makers for not sinking to the tired and hackneyed found-footage format.  It had to be discussed in preproduction:  College students out on a research field trip getting sucked into the haunted woods.  Of course, one of them will bring a video camera to document the research.  No better way to cover up bad camera work and bad acting.  The method was creepy good when I first saw it, but has now just become an annoying trick of third rate movies.

Listen to the ""song"" in scene 1.  I DARE you not to feel physically ill after listening to the abomination in its entirety.

After listening to this you will be able to identify yourself as either Person 1 or Person 2.

Person 1 enjoys the ""song"" and ""feels like they're really there"".  May God have mercy on your soul.

Person 2 hangs their head in their hands and laments the fact that nowadays anyone can make a movie.  There are great indie films in this genre.  The other 99.5% are like this one.

After a quick splash intro where we have a topless scene followed straight on by a double kill, we join our heroes, three college boys and four very pretty coeds. Out to do agronomy research. This is the first agronomy slasher I've ever seen. There's this whole back story about how the site they're researching on is where some settlers and Indians (Trent! Native Americans! Please?!?!) clashed and slashed and cursed, but we never learn too much about it, just see the grisly results. That's right, nearly no exposition to get bogged down in. It's slow paced for sure, focusing around the sex lives and inner struggles of the seven campers (a lot of campers for a slasher!).
