2245195,5,B0007UVXCM,Great pack. Only for those with the love for ultimate gore and horrible production. Any true zombie lover will want this pack on the shelf.,1168819200,2,139,4.6
2245196,4,B0007UVXCM,"At one point Anchor Bay was the place for horror flicks of the 70s and 80s. In recent years they have started putting out newly produced B-movies that are average at best. Worth watching once, but you aren't in a rush to see them again.

As much as I love Halloween and the Evil Dead flicks how many versions can really be put out before you think enough already?

Well Media-Blasters is the savior. They have put out a lot of cult classic horror films from Italy, something Anchor Bay used to do.

Zombie 3 was directed by Lucio Fulci who apparently at the time was sick and it shows. Claudio Fragasso & Bruno Mettei also directed a couple of scenes of Zombie 3, but are un-credited.

As much as I like Lucio Fulci he can be great with one movie than below average the next. While Zombie 3 isn't the worst film of his career it's far from the best. Overall though Zombie 3 is a fun silly movie.

Zombie 4: After Death was made by Claudio Fragasso and it's a weak movie that doesn't have enough gore and lets face it that is why we are watching these flicks. Bad movie? Sure, but fun? Yes.

And finally we have Zombie 5: Killing Birds, which was released before Zombie 3. It's not uncommon for flicks from Italy to have alternate titles and it's not uncommon when released in the States to have the movie billed as a sequel even if it isn't. Weird though Killing Birds is billed as Zombie 5 when it came out before 3 & 4, but oh well.

Claudio Lattanzi is credited as director, but Killing Birds was actually directed by Joe D'Amato.

Killing Birds might be the worst of the bunch, but I sort of enjoyed it for the simple fact this movie features some of the dumbest characters in a horror movie.

Bottom line is you aren't getting any of the all time greats with the Zombie Pack, and Lucio Fulci and Joe D'Amato have done far better work then what we have here, but you are getting some really cheesy and very fun movies with a decent amount of gore.

Each movie on their own goes for a little over $20, but here you get all 3 for a little under $20. Now that is one hell of a deal.

Right now I'm loving Media-Blasters they are putting out some great cult classics.",1159747200,10,2167,4.248175182481752
2245197,2,B0007UVXCM,"Now I love zombie movies and Zombie and Zombie 2 (which believe it or not are the same movie) were good but 3, 4, and 5 are terrible! Bad dubbing and terrible script! If these are sequels, how come they don't follow what happened in the first movie? There's so many plot holes as well, especially in Zombie 3 and 4 and for some reason the ""heroes"" in the movies keep finding random stashes of M16A1 assault rifles in the oddest places such as hotels and hospitals. Nothing makes sense in 3, 4, and 5. I reccomend not buying this, I mean the price is good but the movies are terrible... I heard some of the dumbest quotes ever taken from a movie in some of these films... for example from Zombie 3; ""Man this Blue Heart (local DJ) has some great music!"" - Soldier 1 ""Yeah! This music is making me horny!"" - Soldier 2 Wow... Great script writing there!",1152316800,4,850,4.285714285714286
2245198,5,B0007UVXCM,"I picked this up, because I figured, ""Well, I'd buy Zombi 3 for that much, why not get the other two as freebies?"" And yes, I'm quite happy.

Zombi 3, in case you haven't seen it or the reviews of it here on Amazon, is a nice little zombie romp. If you've seen Zombi 2, don't expect anything like that. I always like to say that this movie is much better if you put it with the likes Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness instead of Dawn of the Dead and Zombi 2. You'll have much more fun that way.

Zombie 4 is decent. The gore is lacking, and the zombies remind me of villians from Power Rangers, but if you've already seen a whole lot of zombie movies, you know that a good deal of them are utter filth. This one is still mostly trashy, but it's at least a few steps above utter filth. So, as far as I'm concerned, between that and Zombi 3, the package is already worth more than I paid for it.

And then we come to Zombie 5: Killing Birds. Of course, it's wrongfully titled Zombie 5(it came out a year before the official Zombi 3), and the ""killing birds"" are nowhere to be seen except at the very beginning and VERY end of the movie. In between we have the normal mess of college students camping out in an abandoned house and then panicking and acting like silly morons when a couple of zombies show up. There's some alright gore here, but nothing to save the movie.

But whatever. Killing Birds is practically a completely free movie at this point.

So yeah, you've got Zombi 3 which is a great little zombie romp, Zombie 4 which is a semi-dud, but not so much of a dud that you can't watch it once or twice, maybe three times, and then you've got Killing Birds which you can watch once and laugh about afterwards.

That's certainly worth the pricetag, I'd say.",1131148800,33,1763,4.201183431952662
2245199,5,B0007UVXCM,"5 stars for the price of the package! 2 or 3 stars for each movie! These zombie films are not the best zombie films ever made,but for the price you can't go wrong here.

2245225,4,B0007UVXCM,"I'm a fan of low budget or B Horror from the 70's and 80's, but not a great fan of Italian Horror, I got this pack thinking it would be super cheesy and laughable, and these movies have there moments, but overall Zombie3 and 4 (haven't watched 5 yet) turned out to be right entertaining and had what I consider a lot of blood and gore. I was also surprised to find the prints were quite good, not excellent but far above the typical value set, and there were lots of extras including interviews and commentary. Obviously these are not the best zombie movies ever made, but they are far from the worst, I enjoyed them, and I'm happy to have them in my collection.",1331942400,3,662,4.304
2245226,3,B0007UVXCM,"I should start out by saying that these three movies, although labeled as numbers3, 4 and 5 in a series, are completely unrelated except for the fact that they deal with zombies, although they're not even the same type of zombies.

  The first movie in the collection, Zombi 3, is probably most likely to appeal to general horror fans. It's got a good solid bloodiness, humor both inadvertent and advertent, and an actual cohesive storyline. The other two aren't as good and might only appeal to the serious zombie enthusiast.

  ZOMBI 3-Directed by Lucio Fulci as a kind of sequel to his hit, Zombi2. A scientist in the Philippines accidently creates a serum that turns people into zombies. It's stolen by terrorists and yadda, yadda, yadda, everyone is turning into zombies. Enter the gun happy military! Highlights include a funky narrative provided by a groovy DJ, zombie birds and a zombie birth! This one is good, honest, zombie-flavored fun.

  ZOMBIE 4:AFTER DEATH-The zombies in this one are more like zombie/demons and they are raised by a voodoo priest seeking vengeance after his daughter was accidently killed by some scientists who were trying to cure her cancer. 20 years later the only survivor of that zombie/demon attack teams up with some mercenaries to commit horrible acts against the Italian film industry. It's a so-so entry in the zombie movie lists, with some true 80'cheesiness, mediocre gore and acting and production values borrowed from a high-school film class.

ZOMBIE 5: KILLING BIRDS-Robert Vaughn (yeah, Napoleon Solo himself) must have really needed plastic surgery money to have taken this job. A soldier returns home after Viet Nam, sees his wife in bed with another dude and goes a little bit nuts, killing wife, the other guy, family , friends and everyone he can get his hands on except his infant son, who is given up for adoption. 20 years later the now adult son is making a documentary about an endangered Louisiana bird and so visits a Dr. Fred Brown, ornithologist and his real father. He brings an annoying film crew with him and at some point for some reason zombies attack! I think they were the bodies of the people Dr. Brown killed all those years ago but I'm not sure. With far too little gore, suspense, unintentional humor and atmosphere, this one is more like to evoke pity or resentment than laughs or screams.",1266537600,7,2366,4.84863523573201

zombi 3 is like a collab of Fulci, Mattei, and Fragasso but Fulci left during half the movie they obviously reuse zombie extras and the commentary is very strange (2 actors said that a cast member was actually shot at!)

zombie 4 has a lot look-alike actors in it and a barely there plot theres a lot of zombie shooting and stupidity that makes this really fun

joe d amato made zombie 5 and it has less of a plot then zombie 4 theres nothing here to like joe did a better job with zombie 6",1171497600,,588,4.140350877192983

Zombie 4: After Death was better.  If you like B Horror watch it.  3. Zombie 5: Killing Birds.  I have absolutely no Idea what the title has to do with the movie.  As far as Zombies there were two creatures at the end that were who know what, because prior to there appearance there was no mention of the undead.  The plot if there was one totally escaped me.

8052139,4,B0007UVXCM,"I received this collection as a Christmas gift. To be fair, I picked it out. I am a zombie movie fanatic. I've been watching and buying zombie movies, of all kinds, since I was in grade school in the early nineties. I e got over 20 years of zombie fanaticism under my belt. So trust me, when I say, this collection is not for everyone.
Zombi 3 is an excellent movie directed by Lucio Fulci. Basically, anyone who claims to be a true zombie movie lover, not one that came along in the last 10 years (Dawn of the Dead- remake, Zombieland & The Walking Dead, along with the hundreds of wannabes), will know and love George Romero, Dario Argento, and Lucio Fulci. True fans also know some of the best entries in the genre were made in the 1970's. Only fairly recently have movie production companies realized the $$$ to be gained by a good Zombie flick. Mind you, there have been a number a good flesh-eater movies made some nice 2000. But aside from a handful (like 28 Days Later) have captured the serious side of the zombie phenomenon. Most edge toward the ridiculous side like Zombieland, Dead Snow, and the like. There are a few that manage to straddle the line between horror and comedy like Evil Dead 2. Anyhow, I could discuss the merits of each type of zombie movie (Horror, comedy, and comedy/horror), but I've digressed enough. Let it suffice to say they all have a special place in my heart.",1482883200,,1399,4.46875

now zombie 4 hmmm what can i say err it has zombies kinda haha,,,  and then theres zombie 5 err well more like birds  but err well watch and see lol

These 3 films use the title zombi meaning they are parts 3-4-5 but in name only,, see zombi as we know it here in usa was over there called zombi 2 because over there dario who produced Dawnof the dead made a cut version with more goblin soundtrack  faster pace edits and released it as gues what zombi so for rap up to have the whole set you need..

1 Dawn of the Dead (Dario Cut version)  its known as Zombi
2 Lucio Fulci's classic know in usa as zombi, but over there its zombi 2
3 then Zombi 3
4 Zombi 4
5 Zombi 5
Then you can say i got the whole set :)

A ragtag group of tourists must fend off the zombies as well as the militia sent in by the government to shoot anything that moves.
