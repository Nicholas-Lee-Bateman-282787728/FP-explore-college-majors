8548316,5,B00A8MBQ6C,"Contains 2 individual films one about Mick & one about Keef  Both are enticing and entertaining and at about 3 hours overall which for this reviewer kept the attention and proved worthwhile throughout is asset worth investing in for Stones fans everywhere. No brand new interviews with either of the subjects unfortunately but plenty of archive footage both live and interview, and decent contributors throughout.",1385683200,,413,5.3538461538461535
8548317,1,B00A8MBQ6C,"DO NOT purchase this item.  It's a ripe off and this is why. KEITHY RICHARDS UNDER REVIEW is the same video as Keith Richards the Human Riff. The second DVD is The Roaring 20's. I don't know if Amazon knows what is going or not, but they need to be if it's being sold on Azom.com !!!!

Under whaT Makes a good review, what I would like to have wanted to know; it would have been these 2 disk were repackaged under a new title and sold as if was new.",1361836800,,449,3.923076923076923
8548318,1,B00A8MBQ6C,"I was looking forward to see 2 new DVDs upon title seemed to be interesting Mick vs Keith - When i umpacked the box DVD about Keith is UNDER REVIEW which was sold as single DVD since 2007 and the one about Jagger is The Roaring 20s Glory Years back from 2011 also sold as a single DVD - both single DVDs are good so far but the package leads to think, that it is something very new - NOTHING NEW, NOT AS ADVERTISED from 2013 !!! Quite a Rip Off, quickly returned the set as i owned both DVDs already - OLD STUFF NEW PACKED - THANKS A LOT !!!",1361404800,2,541,3.8828828828828827
