5724593,5,B00CJLW4ES,"Wildly inaccurate...on purpose. If you're looking for a serious, glossy Sorkin-esque drama, just walk away. But if you're looking for a weird, clever, and surprisingly insightful indie comedy with a pitch-perfect cast, stop reading this review and press play. Not only does this movie brilliantly parody other Steve Jobs biopics, it hilarious deconstructs the entire biopic genre. This movie knows exactly what it is. And what it is...is awesome.",1376870400,,446,5.478260869565218
5724594,5,B00CJLW4ES,"I can't say a bad thing about it! IT'S GREAT!!! I'm not one to be able to sit through a whole movie, I have now watched iSteve 4 times...",1376092800,,137,3.7586206896551726
5724595,3,B00CJLW4ES,"I couldn't really get into iSteve, as much as I wanted to.  I guess I didn't know what to expect from the film.  The overall premise and presentation is probably one of the funniest ideas I've heard in a long time, but there are just too many half baked concepts in the film that the whole thing falls apart by the end.

  iSteve portrays Jobs largely as a brilliant and gentle man.  Wozniak is not the lovable, brilliant sidekick that we know him to be.  Instead, he is portrayed as a mumbling buffoon, incapable of free thought or standing up for himself.  This role reversal is one of the more entertaining parts of the film, particularly in showing Woz's lot in life at the end of the film.

  Unfortunately, the film lost me about halfway through.  The concept of being a completely inaccurate account of his life only carries it so far.  Most of the jokes are in these inaccuracies, and depend on the viewer having knowledge of these real world events to ""get it"".  The dialogue is almost entirely void of humor.  There is some visual humor, such as Jobs' bathroom meeting with John Sculley.  By the time Steve has a drug fueled epiphany with another man in the 90's, which gives birth to his vision for the future of Apple, I found myself hoping that the movie was near an end.  It just wasn't funny.

  Like I said, the idea behind the film is really funny, but it just didn't translate well onto the screen.",1376006400,,1416,4.43579766536965
5724596,4,B00CJLW4ES,"I cannot wait to see how close ""Jobs"" comes to being EXACTLY LIKE THIS MOVIE! Seriously, this is right up there with ""Walk Hard"" for best biopic parody of all time.",1375056000,,164,4.32258064516129
5724597,5,B00CJLW4ES,"If you're a fan of quirky comedy AND Apple, you'll love it. Much better than pirate's of silicon valley. Loved it",1371772800,,113,4.428571428571429
5724598,5,B00CJLW4ES,"I didn't think it was possible to make a comedy about Steve Jobs but they pulled it off. The movie is part documentary, part complete parody, and 100% endearing. I felt like the movie did a great job of poking fun at the whole mystique of Steve Job's life. Some of my favorite characterizations were of (spoiler alert!) Wozniak as the overweight loser. In reality we all know he played a huge part in what Apple became but he's so often characterized as being slighted for being ""too"" nice. I think the movie does a hilarious job of taking that image to a whole new level. Makes you realize how ridiculously he's treated by popular media. Another favorite scene was when he has virtual sex with Melinda Gates in his oft depicted barren living room. It's ridiculous turns like this that keep you guessing what's next. In the end, it's not an accurate documentary of Steve Jobs - but a parody of all the ones we're about to be barraged with - and that's the most endearing way I can think of celebrating this man's life.",1367971200,2,1018,4.478494623655914
5724599,5,B00CJLW4ES,"Basically, this feels like a mockumentary about how a network TV company would produce a mini-series about Steve Jobs: extremely over-the-top, simplistic, and inaccurate interpretation that dumbs down history for the sake of ""mass appeal"" and more exciting dynamics.

If you love Christopher Guest movies and Walk Hard (The Dewey Cox Story), and know some actual Apple/Steve Jobs history, you will love this.",1367798400,2,408,5.476190476190476
5724600,4,B00CJLW4ES,"This movie is weird but awesome. It's not exactly a biopic since it is absurdly inaccurate in parts; it's not exactly a comedy since it is surprisingly dramatic in parts; and it's not exactly a spoof since it doesn't really follow the typical spoof formula. It's a combination of all three of these which makes for a refreshingly different kind of movie.

Justin Long (the guy from the PC vs. Mac commercials) does a great job as Steve Jobs. The best scene in the movie is Justin as Steve directing another actor, playing Justin Long, in the original PC vs. Mac commercial - super funny.

In general, the more you know about Apple and Steve Jobs the more you'll enjoy this movie. Be ready for a film that doesn't take itself too seriously though.",1367798400,,746,4.559701492537314
8582645,4,B00CJLW4ES,"There has been some million-dollar movies done about Steve Jobs. This is a low-budget, ironic, ""quick-and-dirty"" story, made some time ago.
Do not expect the serious, balanced, top-quality Hollywood block buster. But actually, it quite fun. At least for us Mac nerds...",1455148800,,269,5.428571428571429

8582650,4,B00CJLW4ES,"Well,iSteve prides itself about this: the first biopic of Steve Jobs. In my opinion,it should be considered the second considering the 1999 TV movie,Pirates Of Silicon Valley happens to be the first movie depiction of the late Apple Chief despite the fact that the Noah Wyle-and- Anthony Michael Hall-starrer happens to focus on the history of personal computers and both Jobs and Microsoft founder,Bill Gates. But to me,it will forever be the first comedic tribute of the Apple founder.

Justin Long stars as Steve Jobs,who acts as a narrator. It provides a funny and satirical examination of his life from the days of the garage when he and Steve Wozniak started building computers until his return to Apple as he leads it to become the most valuable in the world with the release of the i-products like iMac,iPod,iPad and iTunes.

Well,I have always believed in the saying that comedy divides people. Some people liked iSteve as they laughed a lot at the jokes. Others did not for they don't find it funny at all. I felt that the viewers watching it should have information on the life of Steve Jobs to fully appreciate it. If not,you won't find it funny at all. Others who are knowledgeable of Jobs' life took the film too seriously as they wanted 100% accuracy on the events did not appreciate it without realizing that it is a parody or events will be both laughable and fictitious. In the end,what group do you belong to find appreciation on the film?It is only then the viewer would know whether he or she will find the film funny or not.",1442620800,,1546,4.680147058823529
