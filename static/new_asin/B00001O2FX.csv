7914603,3,B00001O2FX,"The Great Events of Our Century DVD set is a 5-disc set, each disc comprising of 2 1-hour documentaries relating to a theme of the past century (actually, up until the late 90's).  While the documentaries are well-researched, the fact that each documentary is only 1 hour long necessitates just a very brief touching on the various subjects.  Still, the documentaries are diverse and talk about everything from human rights to entertainment, to wars to science.
The DVD's themselves are nothing special.  Full frame, no special features to speak of.  However, the fact that there are 2 episodes per disc ... makes this a decent set if you're a History-channel type.  The only thing I wish the set had was what happened in the last 3 years of the century (as we all know, there were a few very signficant events just in those last 3 years), but alas, guess we'll have to wait for the ""Ultimate Edition.""",997833600,15,902,4.6835443037974684
