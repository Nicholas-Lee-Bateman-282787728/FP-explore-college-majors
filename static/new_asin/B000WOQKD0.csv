2987876,5,B000WOQKD0,"This is the best Bean ever made. It is a very special, beautiful roadmovie, it makes you smile, giggle and laugh, it touches your heart, it makes you admire its beauty... it is slapstick with romance... it is romance with humor... it is great cinema.  Rowan Atkinson is better than ever, his Mr. Bean has reached the Olympus of art. Peter Sellers, Sir Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton will love him. But... Mr. Bean is alive and well.

Thank you, Rown Atkinson!
Thank you gvery much for this great movie!

2987877,4,B000WOQKD0,"Why was this movie entertaining?  The acting and casting was on track... this was not a collection of The Young And The Restless actors.  These people had real flaws... in their looks and their characters.

Rowan Atkinson's facial expressions are priceless.  He only uses three non-English words... two are French, and one is Spanish but he believes it is French (""gracias"").  Everyone around him is serious, even when Mr. Bean is totally nuts. And, yes, there is a story line throughout the slapstick, dancing, lip-synching, and psycho-oyster behaviors.

Now, what I don't know is how viewers would respond to Mr. Bean if they had never experienced him before.  He is an acquired taste.

Favorite scenes?  Hitchhiking, bumming for change, and staying awake while driving.

Worse scene?  Acting like a WWII German soldier as a movie extra (for a yogurt commercial).

Think of this movie the next time you eat sea turtle-friendly shrimp.",1188777600,,936,5.0855263157894735
2987878,5,B000WOQKD0,"Compared to recent American Comedies that consist of an endless series of explosions and fart jokes (when they're not burping), this British Film is a delight.

Although much of the film may be a bit slow for American tastes, the pace is well considered and the leisurely segments only make the manic episodes all the more enjoyable.

Like the Disney Hit ""Meet the Robinsons"", much of the movie doesn't seem to make sense, until the ending when everything comes together in a brilliant, laugh-out-loud conclusion.

A MUST SEE !!",1188777600,27,528,4.910112359550562

2987880,3,B000WOQKD0,"The long-awaited second Bean movie, Mr. Bean's Holiday, has a running time of only 83 minutes -- or about 80 minutes too long, as one wag put it at the screening we attended.
One is either a fan of Mr. Bean or one is not, and as actor Rowan Atkinson himself has pointed out, Bean is not a favourite of critics because the humour is too simple. Something like that, anyway.
In Mr. Bean's Holiday, our hero wins a contest and his prize is a trip to Cannes. Whatever can go wrong on his travels does go wrong; he is taken for a child abductor, among other problems, and he wanders through the landscape with a Russian child in tow, having mistakenly separated the child from his father. Mr. Bean's misadventures are many.
He loses his tickets and passport, gets tossed off a train, chases chickens (don't ask) gets locked in a shed, rides a bike, wanders into the filming of an advertisement and sabotages a movie screening at Cannes.
There are a handful of very funny moments in the movie, most of them dedicated to making fun of pretentious movies and their filmmakers (represented by Willem Dafoe.)
Mr. Bean's holiday footage gets inserted into Dafoe's ridiculous film, to great comic effect. The sequences in Cannes are mostly amusing, and Mr. Bean even gets to meet a girl: Sabine (Emma de Caunes). His amateur filmmaking helps make her a star.
Mostly, though, Bean mugs and grunts for the camera, and very quickly it all wears thin.",1188518400,,1435,4.609375

It has a great supporting cast too.  It's much better than bean:the movie, because it does in fact, have a plot.  It's exactly the oppisite of events strung together, as Bean:The movie was.  This movie has a wonderful story line that keeps the audience laughing and crying at the same time.
One of the best movie's i have seen in a very long time.",1188432000,4,513,4.473118279569892
2987883,1,B000WOQKD0,"I am a huge fan of the British Television series ""Mr. Bean"", created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis (who would go on to write ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and write and direct ""Love, Actually). The series, available on DVD and shown on PBS stations from time to time, follows the adventures of Mr. Bean (Atkinson), a largely silent, slightly bitter, single British man, who finds himself in various predicaments. Because the character is largely silent, he gets into a variety of situations leading to a lot of physical comedy. And he is largely reminiscent of great comedians like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton.

A few years ago, they made a film called simply ""Bean"", which was released in Europe before it came to the United States. A huge hit, the film was scheduled for release in later summer here in America and quickly flopped. It's easy to see why the character is such a draw in Europe; because he almost never speaks, it isn't a lot of work to translate his dialogue for foreign countries. Everyone understands physical humor. ""Bean"" was a dreadful film. The story quickly builds a pretense of getting the character to Los Angeles where he interacts with his host family and their two `adorable' kids and Burt Reynolds plays a supporting role. The film chose to replay a number of situations from the series and added two kids, who could, presumably, relate to the overgrown child in Bean. It didn't work.

When I first saw the trailer for ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", the newest film featuring the Rowan Atkinson creation, I was intrigued. It seemed to be a thinly veiled re-working of the Jacques Tati classic ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" with the Bean character taking the place of Mr. Hulot. Jacques Tati's films are also significant for their sparing use of dialogue and it seemed like the translation might lead to more success.

I was very nave.

""Holiday"" starts promisingly. Bean (Atkinson) speeds his little Mini Cooper to a broken down church barely making the announcement of the winner of their big raffle. As it is June in England, the torrential rain is dampening everyone's sprits and Bean is especially eager to win an expense paid trip to the sunny beaches of Cannes. He wins and he has a couple of amusing moments at the beginning of the journey. After he arrives in Paris, and finds the train to Cannes, he asks a gentleman to take some video of him boarding the train. The gentleman misses the train and Bean soon realizes the man's young son has been left behind on the train. Bean realizes he has to help reunite them and they set off on a trip across France, trying to get to Cannes. Along the way, they cross paths with an American film director (Willem Dafoe) who is also on his way to the Cannes Film Festival and the young French actress (Emma de Caunes) he is courting.

""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" misfires on just about every count. Even the amusing situations he gets involved in on the train to Paris, at the beginning of his journey, are just that, amusing. They aren't so funny you will forever remember them forever, or so funny they redeem the film, they only manage to create a smile. The best of these is when Bean wanders into a restaurant at Gare Du Lyon, because he has some time to kill before taking the train to Cannes, he decides to eat a meal. He inadvertently orders a Platter Fruit De Mer from the Maitre' D (Jean Rochefort, ""The Man on the Train"") and is shocked to find a huge platter of oysters and large prawns, complete with eyes, delivered to his table. Atkinson is a gifted comedian with an extremely expressive face and we instantly feel his pain when he eats his first raw oyster.

But this same gifted comedian can't help make other scenes more than slightly amusing. For instance, he tires to amuse the boy on the train by pasting pieces of paper on his eyelids and tongue and make them move around. This is just creepy. Later, he interrupts a screening of a film at the Cannes Film Festival in a protracted bit of unfunny business, which points to a very obvious joke.

Why do these films fall so flat? It seems a shame they attempt to make these films appeals to such a broad audience. In each, Bean is paired with precocious children in a blatant attempt to both appeal to this demographic and point out the obvious comparisons between Bean's character and the children. ""Holiday"" is rated G because it contains nothing that could be considered even slightly racy or daring. But I think little kids will be bored by Bean's relatively low-key antics.

One of the great things about the show is Bean was usually a little bitter about how put upon he felt. He felt entitled to certain things and when he didn't get them, he became slightly exasperated. In the films, the attempts to make him universally appealing have robbed him of this aspect of his character and simply serve to make him boring.

There are two very funny moments in ""Holiday"". At one point, Bean begins to karaoke or pantomime to an aria from an opera as people walking through a French market stop to watch. Later, Willem Dafoe's American director premieres his latest film at the Cannes Film Festival and we get to see snippets of the overly pretentious piece of crap he has created and is so clearly in love with.

But these moments are few and far between and it takes a long time to get there and a long time after they happen until the film finally ends. When the film does finally end, you feel a sense of relief. You no longer need to wait, hoping something, anything funny might happen. Sure, it is a wait in vain, but you never give up hope.

""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" isn't funny enough, amusing enough or clever enough to warrant your money or time. That's sad because Rowan Atkinson is a very funny guy and Mr. Bean has provided some hilarious moments on his television series. Rent that on DVD instead.",1188172800,11,5841,4.590604026845638
2987884,3,B000WOQKD0,"Oh Mr. Bean, what are we going to do with you? For years Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean character has been a worldwide sensation. You'll always hear that laughter may be the universal cure for sickness, but to find something that everyone would find funny...now THAT is the challenge! Somehow, being a man of few words, Mr. Bean has been the universal character that people all over the world love. It's not hard to see why. I always found it impressive that a character who speaks so few words (if, indeed, he speaks at all) manages to make me laugh so hard I want to bust a gut. Comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chaplin/dp/B0000A9D2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chaplin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buster-Keaton/dp/B00005QW5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buster Keaton </a>&nbsp;are not uncalled for. In fact, they are actually a very accurate way of describing Mr. Bean, and his new movie ""Mr. Bean's Vacation."" I must admit, humor is not the easiest thing to write about. Likewise, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is not a movie I can easily describe because there isn't much to describe.

There is no story in this movie. There are some connecting events, but outside the fact that Bean wins a trip to Paris and is attempting to get a lost boy to the Cannes Film Festival, there really isn't much in terms of story. Heck, there isn't even much in terms of dialog. Unlike the previous Bean film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bean-The-Movie/dp/B00007AJF7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bean: The Movie</a>,"" Mr. Bean has returned to being his clumsy, mumbling self. No speeches, no conversing in American slang, just Bean messing up in every sticky situation he gets himself in. There are moments when the film stalls, but there are much more laughs to be found then groans. In fact, I'd venture to say there were at least three scenes that had me laughing so hard, my stomach actually began to hurt. You know the feeling right? You start laughing. Then you continue laughing. Then you can't stop laughing.

Then you grab your stomach in pain, trying to catch your breath, but you just can't stop laughing. Yeah, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" can be like that sometimes. In a rare leap of faith, most the dialog that DOES make it's way through the movie is in French, with subtitles! This makes sense since Bean is traveling with a French boy he can't communicate with, which is the source of many of the misunderstandings in this movie that results in gags. But it's also daring because the characters must come to understand each other through their body language instead of their speech, which makes the language in this movie universal. Indeed, the few times the subtitles do show up it won't matter, because even if the kids can't read the subtitles they can read the body language, and thus they still get the joke.

One thing I would keep an eye out for is a scene involving Bean eating sea food, which is most likely the single funniest scene I've seen at the movies all year so far. Now, I'm going to be honest, this is an easy movie to stomp on. The art of Chaplin and Keaton is no longer appreciated by most of today's audiences, who prefer character say the f word every other word in order to gain a laugh. People also like jokes with very perverse suggestions (sometimes very perverse dialog to go with it). The idea of getting people of all ages, of all ethnic's, of all religions to one screening of ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" and having them all laugh must sound like a foreign idea. The idea of paying $10.00 to see a movie that essentially has no story must at the very least sound strange. But ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is a very unique film in these regards.

Yes, it has flaws. There are moments where the film just drags, and the skits aren't sown together as flawlessly as they could be, but these points are moot. The bottom line is ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is pure comedy. Not all of it works, but most of it does. It's something the whole family can see and not be offended by. In fact, it may even be smarter then most of the big star ""comedies"" that we've seen released this year. It's not perfect, but if you're looking for a comedy, and especially one that you can bring your kids to, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is a winner.

2987889,3,B000WOQKD0,"I am a big fan of this movie and own the standard resolution release, saw the film in the theater and know it well.
So I was very disappointed that this release has been mercilessly edited. Some of the best comedy bits, and even
straight scenes have been cut. Some sight gags have been swapped with previously cut material.
Also, some key music has been changed, maybe because of copyright issues (even
cellphone jingles have been changed!)

I can only guess that the scenes were cut due to their exhibiting some of Mr. Bean's poor behavior, but that is
a big part of the appeal of the character! It is as if the person/people responsible have no idea what the character is about.
I highly doubt Rowan Atkinson had any input in these decisions.

I am very glad I have the first (non Blu-ray) release of this film as it was originally shown in American theaters.

I am hoping that there are other Blu-ray releases available with the original content, as the one I have appears to
be created for multiple markets due to all the various logos on the box. It could be that the cut content was to appease
a different countrie(s) rating board to retain a G rating. Just a guess.

2987963,3,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson's curtain call as Mr. Bean seems like it should've happened ten years ago. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this movie, really, but it does often feel empty and spacious, like we're all just going through the motions one last time. There's a requisite number of repackaged old skits from the character's long history, interspersed within a lightly curvy, family-friendly plot. Bean's awkward natural charisma is still in attendance, despite his curmudgeonly exterior, and he plays well alongside his two costars: a nearly-mute foreign boy and a stunning French beauty. The language barrier plays well into both relationships, as many of the masthead characters' best adventures play like a silent film. It's fine, I guess, and it certainly entertained my two young boys (we've watched it dozens of times since it went up for streaming on Netflix) but there's nothing remotely essential in here and I doubt I'll remember any of it in a few weeks' time.",1451347200,,974,5.170886075949367

2988137,4,B000WOQKD0,"Taking place ten years after BEAN THE MOVIE, Rowan Atkinson returns to portray Mr. Bean one final time in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY (Atkinson announced that this MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY would be the last story that he would do as Mr. Bean). The movie opens with Mr. Bean rushing to attend a charity auction and raffle. It's the big day of the big raffle and the big prize is an all-expense paid trip to the beaches at Cannes, France. Mr. Bean ends up winning the trip and is giddy as a school boy. Bean accidently takes a taxi and is dropped off at the wrong location. Using his trusty compass, he walks all the way back to the train station. While there he has an hour to wait until his next train arrives and he gets into some mischief in a restaurant. Bean eventually gets on the train and finds himself in the company of a Russian boy. He and his father were inadvertently separated at the station due to Mr. Bean. Much of the rest of the movie involves Mr. Bean trying to get the boy back to his father and make it to Cannes. Along the way he mimes Puccini's O mio babbiono caro to earn money; beats some Tour de France bicycle riders; works as an extra in big budget movie; meets a beautiful actress; and happens to become a hit at the Cannes film festival.

MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE. BEAN THE MOVIE seemed to be more focused on tying a bunch of Mr. Bean sketches together in one film and then arranging the story around those sketches. Although there are several Bean bits (both old and new) in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY seems to have been written as a story first and then had the bits added along the way. MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is just a far better story and one with a whole bunch more heart than BEAN THE MOVIE. There are some really funny parts (such as Mr. Bean trying to eat unshelled scampi or miming opera), but the movie also has a real tenderness to it. Mr. Bean really just wants to get to the beach, but he's also protective of the Russian boy he travels with. In some ways, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is the story of when Mr. Bean began to grow up.

Overall, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a very funny, heart-felt movie. It's a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE and is a fine way for Mr. Bean to say farewell.",1394841600,,2249,4.227906976744186
2988138,5,B000WOQKD0,I grew up watching Mr. Bean! I loved his show and all the funny things he did! I LOVE this movie just as much as the show!,1394582400,,122,3.5555555555555554
2988139,4,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson ought to get a medal for keeping his Mr. Bean character up to snuff a full decade after the 1997 ""Bean"" movie. We see the same general mixture of goofy facial expressions, awkward body language, and unusual gestures (well-intentioned and ill-intentioned, successful and unsuccessful) that will either be regarded as childishly immature or wondrously childlike. We see him re-plot a lost course using just a compass and a relentless focus that borders on that of an autistic savant. We see him regard an ambitious platter of French seafood with all the appeal of a root canal and bury some of it in an innocent bystander's purse. We see him accidentally make his own short film - and have it looking not half bad.

This movie is slicker than the 1997 original, and perhaps not as overtly ""feel good"" (but this may simply be a mark of evolving direction tastes), yet it still has a happy - if ludicrous - ending, and is still meant to basically be a family movie. I would say that between this film and the original, the plot of the original movie is probably much easier for the younger viewers to follow and keep track of, but there's nothing strenuously hard to follow in the sequel, either. There is some unmistakable continuity in the screenplay since Robin Driscoll was still involved, so the general consistency in style might be due in equal parts to the production team and Atkinson himself.

Some of the camera work is a little artsy, but this could be an inside joke, especially considering the awkwardness of an immature Brit character in France. I was happy to see a general lack of hand-held camera shots (except for the parts Bean shoots with his new toy, of course). This jittery technique tends to be a detriment to comedies, so I was happy to see that the production team didn't ""jump the shark"" on that one and give in to the supposed consensus.

Some people will complain that the premise isn't strong enough and the comedy is not exactly anything new. It's true, the comedic styles are very, very close to the schtick Atkinson has always used with Mr. Bean, but my question is why mess with a good thing? It basically boils down to this: you either understand Mr. Bean or you don't. Some people obviously do still love this character if you consider the box office figures it generated ($229 million for a $25 million budget - respectable compared to some movies, and not too shabby for a 90-minute comedy).",1394496000,,2441,4.6720930232558135
2988140,3,B000WOQKD0,"First of all the movie, is silly and delightful.  The whole family enjoyed Mr. Bean's crazy antics.  But, I only gave it 3 stars because I ordered it on Prime and it was to supposed to get to my house on Tuesday, but didn't arrive until Thursday. My daughter needed for a high school film review paper that she had to write.  We watched it on Amazon Prime first because it did not arrive in time.

2988142,4,B000WOQKD0,"My husband had seen it before and insisted that I should, also. I am a fan of Rowan Atkinson from his Black Adder series where he actually talks, unlike in the Mr. Bean series.

So, I was hesitant to watch this, knowing how Mr. Bean gets into all sorts of trouble, and I am not one who laughs easily at others' misfortune or silliness.

The parts where Mr. Bean keeps missing all sorts of transport to get to Cannes (and keeping the poor little boy from also doing so) really made me feel frustrated!!!

Thankfully, things improve in the second half, the boy is darling, and all's well that ends well. :) Willem Dafoe is hysterical in his cameo role!  Hence the 4 stars.",1390435200,,670,4.379032258064516

About halfway through I realized that I was watching a live action Curious George movie- no matter what predicament Bean gets into it always comes out okay.  This movie may be of interest to children and Emma de Caunes is as cute as a button, but otherwise this movie is predictable in the extreme, unrealistically resolved and often boring.  There are literally places where you hit the ""status"" button on the DVD player to see how much longer this thing lasts.

Enjoyed it just as much the second time around.",1378425600,,280,5.108695652173913
2988195,5,B000WOQKD0,"Oh my goodness, this is one of my favorite comedies ever!  Rowan Atkinson is at his absolute best - a hilarious but lovable buffoon who wins a trip to the Riviera in a church raffle.  Brilliantly acted by Atkinson and the adorable Emma De Caunes.  Yes, parents, this one is safe to watch with the kids!  No nudity, suggestive content, or foul language.  It's clean.  So many family comedies these days are not funny or just plain stupid.  And who can stand another movie with anthropomorphized talking CGI animals, cars, planes, etc.?  Treat your family to something different.

There's not a lot of dialog in this movie - Atkinson is a master at expressing himself with body language, so few words are needed.  To get inside the head of the simpleton/savant Mr. Bean is a real riot.  The whole sequence where he loses his bus ticket and goes chasing a chicken through the French countryside on a bicycle is hilarious - even more so because a logical person would have realized that the bus has already left and so there's no point in chasing the chicken.  But not Mr. Bean - once he gets his mind set on something, a little thing like logic isn't going to slow him down.

It's actually a good thing that there isn't a lot of dialog in this film - you'll be laughing so hard you wouldn't hear it anyway!",1378166400,,1303,4.470338983050848

2988206,5,B000WOQKD0,"Iv recently become a big bean fan.
The tv show is hilarious, and both movies were good but not as good as the tv show.
The animated tv is funny and I surprisingly like it. I usually hate animated tv shows but this is different.
Only negative thing I will say about bean is they reuse scenes.
In the movie and the tv show bean puts a turkey on his head and cant get it off and runs around with it on. That's just one scene they used more than once, but there's more.

The whole bean-10/10
I loved this tv series, and I wish they made more episodes. I watch the entire series in a few hours, and loved very episode. One thing I don't get is why was there so few episode made? Why did they only make 1-2 episode a year?

Bean the movie-7/10
I really didn't like this movie that much. The plot wasn't good nor interesting but there was a bunch of bean moments which made up for the bad plot.

Bean the holiday-9/10
I really loved this movie. Unlike the first movie i enjoyed the story. Many scenes were great, and this is the closet thing to the orignal bean series.

Bean the animated series-7/10
I really didn't even want to watch this because of my dismay of animated series but I give it a chance and I do like it.
Many scenes in this series has been seen in the movies and the orignal.
Also each episode is only 11 minutes which I don't like.
Overall this is a great set for any beanies out there, but just a heads up you can watch both movies and both tv series on netflix.",1372204800,,1475,4.093425605536332
2988207,5,B000WOQKD0,Mr. Bean is everyman. We can all identify with his insecurities. This adventure in France is priceless. One of my favorite scenes is when he is serenading the public at an outdoor market. This film stresses the importance of communication on a visceral level. It is also a wonderful travel video and ad for France.,1370736000,,314,4.7272727272727275

2988211,5,B000WOQKD0,"Mr Bean's Holiday is light-hearted entertainment for persons who do not take themselves too seriously--and the musical numbers are painfully funny!

2988232,3,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean seemed truly hysterical and brilliant in the original TV series. Some of the funniest moments ever commited to film can be seen on the series. It's classic british comedy at it's best. However there is something about both Mr. bean films that just seem to fall flat in comparison. Somehow the films just don't seem to work as well. This second Bean film is certainly better than the first, but it never is as good as any of the TV episodes Atkinson made. There are moments in this one however that are truly hysterical, but there just seems to be something missing in these full length features. The obvious first thing that comes to mind is the absence of any studio audience chuckling and belly laughing to Bean's antics. The audience helps set the mood of this sort of comedy. I think the series also works well because of it's short 15 minute to 30 minute segments and it seems to work well that way. It's much more difficult to take a Bean episode and then lengthen one basic story into an 80 minute film and keep the good comedic ideas flowing well. In fact this film was funniest when it paid homage to Bean TV episodes from the past that might be familiar to some of us. The first full length feature was very odd. The way it turned out Bean seemed almost creepy and perverted rather than just innocently wierd. So over all though there were some good moments this film pretty much fails to convey the same classic comedy the original series had.",1367884800,,1480,4.485185185185185

Even if you weren't a fan of the original movie ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is a complete 180 in terms of style.  It's not by chance that this was given a similar title to ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" as this movie also relies more on sight gags and visual humor rather than dialogue.  Thankfully, this fits in very well with the Mr. Bean character as he rarely talks.  Those who enjoyed the Mr. Bean TV shows should like this movie as well since the style is very similar to the classic TV shows.

The documentary about how Mr. Bean started was especially cool to see.  **The warning to anyone who would like to know, especially maybe for parents, is that the documentary has shots of female frontal nudity that come up without warning.**  That footage is from an opening from a comedy series Rowan was a part of in his earlier career.

2988349,3,B000WOQKD0,"Those of you familiar with Rowan Atkin's Mr. Bean character will know that Bean is not a man of many words.  So how would you make a full-length feature film out of a virtually non-verbal man in a speaking environment?  The answer is to send him to a place where language, culture, and environmental factors allow him to interact by his own means.  In other words send him on a vacation from London to Cannes.

Although the English dialog left no difficulty for viewers to understand, a change of country made it easier for Bean to fit in.  So in a Borat-like manner he starts off for an adventure that would make even Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold look brilliant.  But unlike either character, Mr. Bean's innocence never varies.

That isn't to say that he doesn't wreak havoc along the way.  But even with his crazy antics and expressions, the film's beginning drags until he meets a young boy, about 11, whose father missed his train because he stepped on the platform to take a picture of Bean.  Of course the boy doesn't take to him at first, but they soon become unlikely buddies.  Although even these two become separated, but they somehow reunite, and Bean picks up a third party, a bit-part actress, along the way.

So you have a boy in search of his father, an actress in search of a career, and Mr. Bean in search of the ocean.  Naturally the climax occurs at the Cannes film festival where Bean alters an arrogant film-maker's entry, creating the funniest scene in the movie and a happy ending for one in all.  And how did this non-verbal man round off his vacation?  By leading the crowd into a song at the Cannes beach.

While the elements of a hilarious film, and even a hint of romance for Bean, were present, gestures that work in a half hour TV show can be redundant and predictable on the full screen.  The movie was definitely packed with action, and while it was not a laugh a minute, the dry commentary and ride to a conclusion somehow managed to hold my interest.",1285632000,,1984,4.5

2988373,2,B000WOQKD0,"How much you'll enjoy ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" will depend in large part on your tolerance for Rowan Atkninson, a rubber-faced comedian who, with his broad physical humor and near-wordless pantomime, harkens back - in style if not in quality - to the silent greats like Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, etc.

In this installment, the British Mr. Bean wins the top prize in a local raffle - an all-expenses-paid trip to the French Riviera.  The movie chronicles the havoc he leaves in his wake both on the way to his destination and in the South of France itself, culminating in a major ruckus at the Cannes Film Festival, no less (this is the best part of the movie, actually).

The problem is that none of it really plays very well as comedy.  After what feels like the longest credit sequence in motion picture history, Mr. Bean launches into a French restaurant bit that Lucille Ball had already done to perfection fifty years earlier.  Things don't get much better from that point on, as Bean races from one pratfall-ridden disaster to another throughout the course of the movie.  And, when all else fails, the filmmakers throw a hapless youngster - a boy who gets accidentally separated from his father at a train station - into the mix to turn this into Atkinson's own version of ""The Kid.""

Mr. Bean may be funny to some, but to me he's just annoying and creepy - the visual equivalent of nails on a chalkboard perhaps.  The grunting and groaning and monosyllabic muttering become unendurable over time, and the constant facial twitching and mugging for the camera don't do much to endear us to the character - or to the performer, for that matter - either.

As a source of laughter, this Bean character is certainly an acquired taste and I'm perfectly willing to concede that there is something in all this labored farce that I simply don`t relate to.  To each his own, I suppose.",1248566400,,1877,4.677811550151976

2988376,5,B000WOQKD0,"Whether or not you find this DVD hilarious or as thrilling as watching paint dry rather depends on how much a fan you are of Rowan Atkinson, the 1980s's British answer to Jerry Lewis. If you care about as much for either one as you would for having root-canal dentistry performed with a jack-hammer,  then you can skip this DVD entirely, and the rest of the review too. Although Mr. Bean, the near-to-silent, endlessly inventive, rubber-faced (and apparently rubber-limbed) every-schlub is a little quieter than Jerry Lewis, he is just as comically accident-prone.

After all, who else on earth could find himself with his foot caught on a tall clothing rack, above his head... on a French TV production set... while costumed as a WWII German soldier... because he was practicing a really, really enthusiastic goose-step... after being shanghaied as an extra. The film involved is a commercial for yogurt, by the way. What the logic is in that, I have no idea, although Mr. Bean subsequently manages to blow up the director.

The plot, such as it exists is gossamer thin, and in places reminiscent of the classic Mr. Hulot's Holiday, being almost entirely composed of sight gags and gentle pratfalls. Mr. Bean wins a charity raffle first prize; a camcorder and an all expense paid trip to the French Riviera.  He gets as far as Paris before the inevitable cascade of misfortune begins. In short order and in no particular order he manages to get his tie caught in a vending machine, fill an expensive handbag with raw oysters and causes a visiting Russian filmmaker to miss the train to Cannes. He also looses his bus ticket to a chicken, after miming a performance of  ""O Mio Bambino Caro"" in a French open-air market in concert with the young son of the aforementioned Russian filmmaker, and has his bicycle run over by a tank He does eventually manage to reach Cannes and the seaside that he has been dreaming of while his home movies of the trip win a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival ... don't ask me to explain how that happened, but be assured there is some gentle fun to be had in skewering self-indulgent movie directors. Don't miss Willem Dafoe's brief turn as an auteur filmmaker/movie star with a hilariously awful but artistic movie. Whatever else can be said about Willem Dafoe, he does have enough confidence to parody himself. And the locations, especially those shot in and around the South of France are beautiful, as gorgeous as an expensive coffee-table book.

Overall, Mr. Bean's Holiday is a gentle, old-fashioned comedy - the kind of family friendly comedy that is hardly ever made any more; it can hardly be more unlike something like ""Borat"" and still be on the same planet. Some bits that are funnier that others, but there is nothing mean, foul-mouthed or vulgar about ""Mr. Bean"".It will even bear watching over and over again. Extras include more than twenty minutes of scenes that were omitted from the finished film, and three aptly titled features: ""French Beans"", which followed some of the more elaborate set-pieces filmed in the Luberon locations, ""Beans in Cannes"", explained how the crew managed to film on location during the international film festival, and ""The Human Bean"" featured brief interviews and reminiscences with other cast members.",1241308800,3,3293,4.8819320214669055
2988377,5,B000WOQKD0,"Ever since a friend of mine told me to watch Mr. Bean on HBO back in the day, I have since loved every second of his hilarious mishaps. I was one of those people who didn't understand, when seeing commercials, what could possibly be so funny. The commercials kinda left out what the concept was. Someone earlier said american's tend to like fast comedies and bupring/fart jokes and whatever. I consider myself very critical of comedies. I don't care if it's ""dumb humor"" (humor that is dumb on purpose to make you laugh) I don't mind some gross humor, I don't care what kind it is, but as long as it's genuinely funny. So I love movies like Ghostbusters, Johnny Dangerously,Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Boy, My Fellow Americans, and Caddyshack. Even Rodney Dangerfield would be able to elevate a normally stupid movie and make me laugh out loud. Which, by the way, is the only way you should laugh. So in came Mr. Bean. I didn't know what to expect, but my friend up till then never steered me wrong. So I watched. At first I thought, this is a bit odd. And, then, even though I still had that same opinion, I realised I was laughing hysterically. He captured the silent clown comdey of chaplin, the classic facial expressions of someone like Lucille Ball, He also had his own style that is unable to be categorized. I was hooked. So anytime it came on I watched. Then the videos came out and i bought all the vhs tapes and eventually the Whole Bean on DVD which was upsetting because they edited out hilarious scenes. Not even sure why. They had plenty of room on the dvds to even add more:( but that's not mr. bean's fault that's the studio's. Anyway, the first mr bean movie wasn't really a mr. bean movie it's like they tried to make him mainstream. I would have preferred two hours of skits actually. Once u have mr. bean talking, u don't have mr bean, he would say stuff in the show but it was small stuff like his name or mentioning teddy etc.  He was not meant to be a mainstream character. He was meant to be someone who didn't fit in with the real world, hence the opening scene of the show in which he appeared to ""just fall to earth"". He was a boy in a man's body. He didn't act within the confines or rules of normalised society, we knew every thing he did was not appropriate or something a grown up man would actually do, that's what made it funny. As for Mr. Bean's holiday, even though it could have moved faster, it was still more true to the original. It's hard to say how mr bean should play out in a movie simply because he only did maybe ten or fifteen minutes at a time, and even then, it was random. Comedy, though doesn't need a plot to work. I hate when people say it does. All it needs is the setup. To say this movie doesn't make sense until the end, misses the point. It's all about Mr. Bean and the chaos he creates. This movie was more true to character than the first one though, and it shows. I would highly reccomend this one. Also I would reccomend mr. bean fans to check out ""the Thin Blue Line"" which is available on dvd in amazon, and ""Black Adder"" both are stylistically different than Mr. Bean but some of the best comdey I've ever seen come out of the uk and better than a lot of U.S. Released Stuff. Also, and no I'm not affiliated with Rowan Atkinson in anyway, LOL Buy the Rowan Atkinson LIVE DVD you will love it. IT's a mixture of standup and visual humor that will blow you away. Everyone I have watched it with me has been in tears by the end. Considering I only knew him as mr bean before watching this, I didn't know what to expect from a talking rowan atkinson, but he totally impressed me and, with comedy I'm not easily impressed.",1240012800,,3677,4.2982708933717575
2988378,5,B000WOQKD0,"If laughing really does improve your immune system, then this movie makes my family healthier every time we watch it. It's always hard to understand why, when you really enjoy something, everybody else doesn't enjoy it also. However, I have to admit that Mr. Bean is clearly not everybody's cup of tea. My husband and I have loved him for years and were thrilled to show this movie to our two young sons and see them laugh riotously all the way through. We just got the dvd out and watched it again last night, and even after about 4 viewings, all of us were still laughing. Every time I watch this movie I see something else that I missed. I suspect that folks who dislike this movie may not have watched it closely enough, because we find nuances to the jokes every time we watch. Yes, Bean is just plain silly, getting laughs from food and general idiocy. But many of the gags work on several different levels, and if you listen carefully to the soundtrack and watch the screen closely, you may see things that will surprise you and add to your appreciation of the movie. Just last night, my husband burst out laughing at a joke he hadn't noticed before because he hadn't read a sub-title closely before. So I recommend you give Mr. Bean's Holiday a chance. My family adores this movie and loves being able to watch a family film that is made by grown-ups for grown-ups and kids to appreciate together.",1239667200,,1405,4.4921875
2988379,5,B000WOQKD0,"This film is really delightful. It is both witty and silly at the same time. The acting is very good with Mr. Bean never saying more than 10 words during the entire film. He is joined bya cast of great commedians taht support the odd story. Mr. Bean expresses himself with mime and he is a true master of this comedy art form using and updating many routines seen in the work of Buster Keaton, the Three Stooges, and even Mr. Magoo comics. The soundtrack is a bright commentary on the action with opera and classic French popular music integrated with some American pop from the 1970s.  I found the European perspective was refreshing compared to many American films that are too fast paced and lack subtle humor integrted with the outrageously silly. I strongly recommend the film. I found that I came away from the film uplifted and fully entertained.",1239494400,,853,4.6490066225165565
2988380,4,B000WOQKD0,"Listen, if you can watch watch Mr. Bean's Holiday without laughing, smiling or at the least smirking, you're way too serious.  This film is fun! In the movie, an Englishman, equipped with his inseparable camcorder, wins an expenses-paid vacation to the south of France. Once there, he encounters language and cultural barriers (the ones he is unable to work through are the most fun!), makes new friends, and enjoys an unforgettable adventure.  The story is conveyed as much physical as verbally, and admittedly, some viewers will see some of Bean's antics to be a little bit silly.  In addition, the plot unfolds slowly, so be aware of that, too.  Otherwise, find your copy of this hilarious family comedy film today.  Thanks for reading.",1238803200,,739,4.975609756097561
2988381,5,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson ices the Mr. Bean cake with this charming film.  We meet an older, mellower Bean, without the moments of petty selfishness that brought an edge to his television shows.

However, even Mr. Atkinson could not weave an hour and a half of Bean sketches together without help.  His traveling companions carry the film from one moment of Bean mania to the next.  Young Max Baldry is brilliant as the lost child who can relate to Mr. Bean on his own level.  The audience is never certain who is rescuing whom.  Emma de Caunes is enchanting and provides an apt foil as the trusting starlet who befriends the hapless Bean.  I will watch this one again just to bask in her smile!

The story comes to a hilarious and satisfying conclusion as all the lives Bean has touched on his journey come together.

It might sound crazy for a film that's mostly mime, but you might want to watch this one with the subtitles on.  After all, most of the people are speaking French, the lost boy and his father speak Russian, and it's easy to miss some of the background humor if you're not a linguist.",1238630400,,1091,4.4646464646464645
2988382,4,B000WOQKD0,"I have always enjoyed Mr. Bean and so am happy to have the collection.  I was only disappointed with this set in that Mr. Beans Holiday was only the standard screen version, not the widescreen.  Mr. Bean the Movie has both versions, it seems ridiculous not to do the same with Mr. Beans Holiday.",1237939200,39,295,4.444444444444445
2988393,3,B000WOQKD0,"Well, overall I'd say that I enjoyed this movie and got enough laughs out of it to make it worthwhile, but I wouldn't watch it again. I think you can only take so much of Rowan Atkinson's ""Mr. Bean."" A newcomer to him (believe-it-or-not), I found him a lot of fun in the first half of the film but, boy, this guy is tough to take in longer dosages. I wonder if others feel that way?

It's weird; the film was entertaining.....but I found myself looking at my watch a lot during the last 20 minutes, hoping it would end.  Atkinson's goofy faces are very funny at first but get tiresome after an hour.

It was a ""cute"" story, anyway, and certainly one the whole family could watch. There is nothing, language or sex-wise, that would offend anyone. This is just old-fashioned, almost silent-film-type slapstick comedy.  Actually I probably laughed more at the ultra- corny lines delivered by Willem Dafoe, whose character pokes fun at film makers.

The film, though, belongs to Atkinson who is in about every scene and hams it up to the max. If you laugh at his contorted facial expressions and limber body (check out his karaoke work!), you'll love the film. It's very lighthearted comedy and I wouldn't knock the innocence of it.",1237766400,,1228,4.614678899082569

2988399,4,B000WOQKD0,"""Mr. Bean: The Ultimate Collection""  is a seven-disc box set featuring the antics of Rowan Atkinson's alter- ego, the long-legged, goofy-looking guy who manages to create comic mayhem wherever he goes.  Mr. Bean, whom Atkinson describes as a child in a grown man's body, was created when Atkinson was a student at Oxford University.

Borrowing from silent film techniques, Bean never speaks, relying instead on facial expressions, sight gags, and slapstick to milk laughs.  Atkinson is Chaplinesque in the way he sets up gags, plants them, and then illustrates his mortification at how badly things have gone.  We feel sorry for his sad-sack ineptness, but still manage to laugh at his constant penchant for getting into awkward, frequently embarrassing fixes. I was reminded of Buster Keaton and even Lucille Ball, two folks who knew how to incorporate and use props comically.  Atkinson cites Jacques Tati's earlier character, Mr. Hulot, as another influence.

The box set contains all fourteen episodes of the original series and the two feature films, ""Bean: The Movie"" and ""Mr. Bean's Holiday.""  In addition, the set contains the animated series ""It's Not Easy Being Bean"" and ""Bean There, Done That.""
Bonus features include deleted scenes, never-before-seen-on-TV sketches, the documentary ""The Story of Bean,""  the 20-minute featurette ""Making of the Animated Series, a music video, and French versions of the feature films.",1230422400,89,1431,5.352678571428571

and finally in response to the review and questions i have seen on here

hate to be the bearer of bad news so far it appears that it is the edited ver. even more so it looks to me as the set is a rehash the seven disc break down like this Mr. bean: vol 1,2,3 ( 3 discs ( thats the t.v. series ( looks to be the the whole bean because of the menus ),then you have bean: the movie( 1 disc ), Mr. bean's holiday( 1 disc ), then you have two disc from the animated series bean there, done that ( 1 disc ) and it's not easy being bean ( 1 disc ) so far I watched some of this the main missing scenes that people talked about from the whole bean being missing are m.i.a here too where he fights with the old lady over the chair in ""do-it yourself"" and where he guess the weight of the turkey in ""merry Christmas""

***Edit to point to the act that is rehash ever more so is vol 1-3 on this set have the same error in the order of episodes as The Whole Bean i am 99.9% sure that it is the whole bean but since I have never seen hat set myself I am still 00.1% not sure",1227398400,25,3173,5.45398773006135

In the train station he stops at nothing to get on without a ticket, and succeeds as a crawling sack of post - but on which train is he carried?

2988419,5,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson is brilliant in his Mr. Bean role. I have never seen the first feature length film, but I have seen most (if not all) of his TV skits, and this film is in keeping with that tone. I loved the skits, and this film provided some of the biggest laughs I have had watching movies in a long time. Yes, there are some groans, but that is to be expected from visual comedy--take that alongside the belly laughs and be grateful!

The best scenes, in my opinion, were the lobster-eating scene, the street improv dance, and the movie showing. The lobster scene had me laughing so hard I almost hurt! In any case, the humor is clean and funny. If you don't like the character of Mr. Bean then don't waste your time, but if you think Mr. Bean is funny, you should like this movie.

2988422,4,B000WOQKD0,"The affable bumbling simpleton from England is back, this time rollicking his way to the south beaches of Cannes, Fr., and boy does he score a home run with one!

Mr. Bean wins a church raffle lottery and a trip to lovely Cannes. He also wins a never-to-parted-with handycam as part of the package win. These are enough and off he sets. However, where there's Mr. Bean, how can trouble be far behind...

There are twists and turns, in typical Mr. Bean style, and he's able to separate a son from his father, miss his train, lose his passport, miss the bus which he had to take instead of the train, drive with his eyelids clipped open, drive an egotistical movie director nuts, win over the heart of a budding French actress... the list can go on and on.

But then, you aren't here to read the story and all the pranks. You'd much rather see them. And, IMO, that would be an excellent idea!

The child in Mr. Bean (rather, the child Mr. Bean!) takes over this movie, and he's been able to deliver an even better package than the original movie years ago.

What separates a Mr. Bean movie from other slapstick creations of the genre is that he takes amusement (of the audience) to new heights, hitherto maintained by the likes of Sir Charles Chaplin. Whoever says really funny gags require good dialogue delivery doesn't know Mr. Bean.

Atkinson has made unbelievably funny moments out of otherwise drab sequences.. like (trying to) dial all the possible nos. to reach the boy's father, lip-syncing an opera on a sunny afternoon in a suburban French town marketplace, eating a seafood platter... in short, really a commendable job.

Why not 5 / 5 - you ask? Well, some of the sequences seemed a bit stretched out to me, and seemed to be placed not to further the story or the plot but just because they had been thought of in the first place and had to be accommodated.

Highly watchable nevertheless!
My favorite scene - the opera in the marketplace!!

2988443,5,B000WOQKD0,"I truly enjoyed watching this film.  Having studied a number of foreign languages, I could understand almost all of the dialogue, and the use of different languages gave a lovely multicultural breadth.  The beautiful scenery added even more richness.

The casting I felt was particularly good.  You've got to have ordinary people whom Mr. Bean can play off of.  All of the characters were believable, especially the movie director and the young boy.  The young actress was too good to be true!  What a beautiful role she played!

Mr. Atkinson takes his work as a communicator very seriously, and the humor is only part of the equation.  For example, the lost bus ticket; what does it mean?  Is it merely a means to get him running after a chicken?  No.  I believe it represents the typically puny way we as human beings try to determine our existence, instead of trusting God to introduce us to the Sabines of this world and line up the bus roofs for us to walk on to the beach.

So, for the many who underappreciate this film, I would encourage them to watch it again, and purposefully look beyond the childishness.  The English tend to be quite subtle about things, and we Americans miss a lot more than we realize.",1214092800,,1217,4.6
2988444,1,B000WOQKD0,"Meh. I found Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean somewhat entertaining on the BBC (aired for me on PBS) in the early 90's, and even found the first film ""Bean"" with a few chuckles, but the silent well's run dry here. In it, Bean wins a contest to go to the Cannes Film Festival, yet only wants to go for the beach (?). Of course he goes on his usual unapoligetic destructive path and loses his tickets, way, and you know how it usually goes from there. But as with other road-movies, this one just seemed to go nowhere. And what bet did Willem Dafoe lose to have to appear in this one? Man, talk about career slumming, even though his character's movie-within-a-movie bit was a tad interesting (yet not funny either).

2988446,4,B000WOQKD0,"Last fall I was on an airplane on a 12 hr flight from Hong Kong. This was one of the movies playing. There were quite a few Chinese students on the plane. It was amazing how this little Englishman had those people nearly falling out of their seats laughing. Two Chinese men sitting beside me were nearly crying from laughter.

I have to say this comedy was far better than the American crap I had to watch going over (License to Wed, Evan Almighty, Knocked up. )I didn't hear any out loud laughter from any of those.

The great thing about Mr. Bean movies is the subtlety (sometimes) of the comedy. Mr. Bean is a one-man demolition derby whose actions start a cascade of destruction and chaos that he himself is completely OBLIVIOUS to! (And when Mr. Bean gets near vehicles with motors, WATCH OUT!)

 As in the opening scenes where he spills coffee into a sleeping train passenger's PC and the person in the other seat gets blamed and a huge fight ensues off the train in which cops are running in from each direction. Mr. Bean has no idea what he's started.

 The other hilarious scene was when he was locked in the little outhouse building on the side of the road. The only way to get out is to get hit by a truck. This was not shown. He carried the building out of scene onto the highway. You hear a huge truck's horn, then a tremendous crash, wood flying. Leaving it to our imaginations was far funnier than seeing the explosion. Atkinson's comedic secret is he gets into little stupid things that we ourselves get into, but hope no one's around to see it. There's  no projectile vomiting or extreme toilet humor that American comedy writers (I use that term loosely) stoop to incessantly.

However, I wish there'd been more scenes like this. I hope Atkinson sticks to Mr. Bean and makes another movie, but please, MORE very clever sight gags like the two above.",1213315200,,1867,4.486725663716814

There is one scene in the middle of the movie that is worth the entire BEAN!!  I cannot give this away as it would ruin it, but suffice it to say it takes place in a marketplace and involves street theatre.  When I saw this movie in the theatrical release, this scene alone almost made me wet my pants - and I wasn't alone.

2988493,3,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson plays the role of Mr. Bean, a middle-aged guy who behaves like a 9-year-old boy. Though Atkinson did an animated series of Bean 2002-03, ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" should be called the character's real comeback since the feature film in 1997, but I am afraid 10 years are too long for most of us.

""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" - the title is a reference to Jacque Tati's masterpiece ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" - is a series of comic sketches. These sketches are loosely tied together in a thin storyline about Mr. Bean who wins a ticket to Cannes and intends to see the beach no matter what happens on his way. It is partly a road movie that also involves a Russian kid, a French actress and a bicycle. Yes, it's Jacque Tati.

Though there are funny sight gags and clever jokes (Jean Rochefort eating a hamburger, or Willem Dafoe playing an egomaniac director, for example), some people might find these comic sketches not as funny as they should. I think I can understand their complaints (especially when they are avid fans of the original TV series) when these gags are done in a rather slack pace, or have been done somewhere else in a better form. You just don't find a tightly-constructed, ingenious script of the TV episodes, where funny things keep happening in the most unexpected way. I was not disappointed with the film very much, but I know ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is not the best of the Bean franchise.

Actually Rowan Atkinson did much funnier sketches on stage or in ""Blackadder"" and ""The Thin Blue Line."" Or the original ""Bean."" The film is not bad. It only reminds me of that fact, though.",1200700800,2,1600,4.607017543859649
2988494,3,B000WOQKD0,"There are many who know who Mr. Bean is. There are some who may not. Both would be pleased to see a movie featuring this character that is suitable for the whole family.

Actor Rowan Atkinson created the character of Mr. Bean for English television some time back. A hit overseas, the show became a staple much like Monty Python, winding up on PBS where enthusiastic viewers fell in love with the dimwitted character whose luck always seemed to turn out good.

In MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, we find Mr. Bean the lucky winner of the church raffle for an all expenses paid trip to the French Riviera, including a camcorder to record his trip. But just like the TV show, no trip for someone like Mr. Bean could turn out normal.

Along the way, Bean ends up accidentally separating a young boy and his father. To make amends, he attempts to help the two reunite. But again, we're talking Bean here, not a normal hero. The adventures of the pair as they try to make their way to Cannes where the boy's father is are hilarious. And all of them are captured on video as Bean shoots everything.

Atkinson is a great physical comedian, but not in a pratfall sort of way. He is one to put to use his entire body in emoting and drawing out an idea on screen. Bean is a character who sees the world through child like eyes, who never realizes he's done something wrong until afterwards. And yet this innocence is what makes him so endearing.

The idea of an Englishman stuck in France with no ability to speak the language helps rather than hinders the story. The strength of Atkinson's Mr. Bean has always been his physicality rather than wordplay and that strength if given a white canvas on which to paint with this set up.

While the laughs might be as funny as some found in the original series, there are plenty on hand. And these are jokes and situations that young and old alike can find something to laugh at.

Tolstoy it isn't but if you're looking for something to make you laugh, by all means give Mr. Bean a try. And once you get through this movie, check and see if the local video store has the series on hand as well. You'll be glad you did.",1200700800,2,2138,4.370277078085643

2988500,2,B000WOQKD0,"Whether you love him or hate him, Mr. Bean keeps doing what he know best--in this case, odd childish comedies. His formula feels dated, repetitive even preposterous, but despite all that, he has an international fan base that will never leave him, why would they? He brings more of the same in his new movie Mr. Bean's Holiday where our classic character has an adventure on his way to Cannes. It is a painful vacation experience for our friend, but satisfying at the end.

Brief Intro Story:
Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) wins a trip to Cannes (Southern France) and a small camcorder--courtesy of his local church. He is exciting and grabs his new prize at starts filming himself and things around him. As he travels, he meets a lost young boy who lost his father--who is also going to Cannes--for the famous film festival. As Bean travels with the boy, more crazy adventures awaits for them.

Review:
Unfortunately most of the drawbacks are created by Bean himself. We virtually watch more of the same sketches that we have seen since the creation of this character--actually his best work can be rented at your local video store. Also the scenes where Bean ""does his thing"" feel forced and sometimes just dead boring. How many times are we going to see a close-up of his face? Mr. Bean please stop recycling your own stuff. This vicious circle goes for about 80 percent of the film.

But not everything is lost for this British icon. Most of the Bean fans will probably appreciate the ""Nazi"" commercial sketch and last scene of the film which is the best of his peculiar vacation. This last theater reunion scene creates a moment of joy for the characters--especially for Bean--and probably for the audience as well. Willem Dafoe is quite entertaining as the egomaniac Actor/Director Carson Clay who sees ""talent"" in someone like Bean and praises his camera technique. In other words, most of the laughs are condensed in the last 15 minutes. It is shame that the audience has to wait until this moment to get some genuine laughs.

The Verdict:
Ten years is a long time to wait for a sequel--and it's predictable the way it was going to turn out. Mr. Bean's Holiday brings almost nothing new to the table after all this time. Few moments and a peachy ending did not save this new effort by the British star. It has some of his traditional work, but do a ""Bean"" search in YouTube and I guarantee that you'll have a much better time watching his classic early work on the internet.",1199664000,2,2477,4.648401826484018

Then we see him in Paris and he misses the TGV and must take the slower local train and gets off and can't get back on and has hilarious adventures before finally arriving at his destination, which coincides with the Cannes Film Festival.

2988542,4,B000WOQKD0,"I've always had a thing for slapstick, and British comedy too. This combines them both in the spirit of Benny Hill.

If you are expecting a lot of dialogue from the hero, forget it. Bean does with grunts, gurgles, and an occasional word, all to great comic effect. A child in a man's body, he just can't cope well with the real world.

As he plods along on his trip to Cannes, you can just see the gags coming a mile away. In fact, if they hadn't happened, I would've been disappointed. Yet, his bad luck was at times excruciating as you just know he's going to do... don't want to spoil the gags.

I enjoyed the first movie and this is no exception. I don't think you can really improve on this formula, and I look forward to the next one. Live on Mr. Bean!",1198454400,,758,4.178082191780822

2988544,4,B000WOQKD0,"Our family approached Mr. Bean's Holiday with little or no Bean foreknowledge, I must admit. I know Rowan Atkinson from the Black Adder series, as well as his bid for immortality as the voice of Zazu in Disney's The Lion King. Bean shows had been recommended to me for years, as I love vintage comedy and British comedy. Having seen this film, now I don't know why I waited so long.

Mr. Bean's Holiday was a total delight from start to finish. At this time, I can't speak for other Bean shows and the first film, but my entire family could not get enough of this film. A sure sign a DVD is a hit is when my daughter watches it again the next day. She particularly enjoyed the ending, when Bean invades the Cannes Film Festival, goes into the projection booth and ... I shouldn't tell you, you have to see it.

We particularly liked the scenes in which Bean lip-synched in the park, begged for money in a train station. It even has a grand finale with a cast of seeming thousands. Like so many fun comedies, it's loaded with memorable set pieces to watch again and again, linked with a simple story line.

There is almost nothing for parents to worry about with this G-rated movie if their kids watch with them (even though it takes place on the Riviera), with the exception of two ""d"" words (in subtitles) and an outtake in which the leading lady lies down in the street in despair (there are no subtitles in the deleted scenes, and like as Ed Norton noted about Ralph Kramden, I don't speak French). I think she's acting out a scene). Bean has a tendency to walk away from disasters he has contrived, much like Laurel and Hardy did when they destroyed someone's house or something like that. it's all very ""cartoony"" in fact, Atkinson's mumbles remind me of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons (which I HIGHLY recommend on the new Warner DVD).

There's no audio commentary (but that seems fitting for a film with so little dialogue) and there are a few short documentaries and deleted scenes.",1197849600,,1988,4.498614958448753

You can say that ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is kind of a throwback to the old school of Chaplin, Keaton, et al.  Rowan Atkinson's lovable Bean, with his his guttaral voice and his penchant for mishap is downright infectious.  Willem Dafoe's pretentious director was a hoot, too.  You haven't lived until you see his yogurt commercial as art film.  This film was released in the waning days of summer when studios routinely dump product on the market.  Don't be fooled.  This film is a real winner.",1197763200,,668,4.64957264957265
2988546,4,B000WOQKD0,"This is a normal Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) type movie, running approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes.  It begins with Mr. Bean's arrival in his little yellow Cooper-looking type car where the drawing will be held for an all-expenses paid holiday (what us Westerners call ""vacation"") to Cannes in the South of France, plus $200 Euro spending dollars and a Sony video camcorder.

Traveling by train from London to Cannes, Mr. Bean immediately begins causing havoc everywhere he goes.  One of the funniest scenes, in my opinion, was close to the beginning of the film when Mr. Bean eats a seafood platter consisting of raw oysters and langoustines.  But there are plenty more funny scenes as Mr. Bean, with little more than a word or two or a grunt, and an occasional ""Oui,"" coupled with gestures and facial expressions of a true comediac, makes his way through the challenges that only he can find in a simple all-expense paid holiday.  William Defoe also appears in the film as a Film Director, en route to the Cannes Film Festival.

Again, a typical Mr. Bean adventure.  If you have never seen Mr. Bean, he is pretty unique and is like watching a silent British comedy.  He does such goofy things and always gets himself into weird situations, and strange things happen to people around him.  From chasing a chicken, to an outhouse scene, to starting a brawl over a laptop, to eating a raw oyster, etc. etc. etc., Mr. Bean is a hoot!",1197504000,,1431,4.669322709163347

Johnny English was an enormous improvement. But Mr. Bean's Holiday is a joyous leap forward. The title recalls Mr. Hulot's Holiday and the film has the feel of a French film, which, as it takes place in France, makes it thoroughly delightful.

It's not simply a few Bean sight gags strung together. There's a gentle undercurrent that washes through the film, culminating, fittingly, on the beach at Cannes. The only movies that worked this well at a leisurely pace that I can recall are Vacation and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. This film manages to be simple and grand at the same time. Understated and clever (and when was the last time a film was understated?)

Even cartoons have forgotten what visual humor is about (for instance the vastly overwritten Simpsons Movie), but here, a classic clown remembers, and against all odds, takes us all on holiday.",1196726400,,1015,4.7942857142857145

2988550,3,B000WOQKD0,"We loved the slapstick elements of Mr. Bean's holiday...and perhaps Mr. Bean is an acquired taste. (For example, he tries oysters on a half shell at a fancy restaurant and pretends to eat them/like them for the snooty waiter. When no one's looking, he dumps the slimy stuff in a lady's purse without her knowing. When her phone, inside her purse, eventually rings--he panics.)

Some parts are a bit slow, but if you hang to the end, you'll find a surprisingly tight plot. I love how they tied it all together at the end (and Willem Dafoe was a marvelous sport!)

However, there was some cussing in the DVD, as well as scenes of faux war--including guns blazing. I'm not a prude--don't mind violence and language normally. HOWEVER, this movie is supposedly rated G, and so I figured there wouldn't be ANYTHING remotely objectionable about this movie...so I let my 9 year old son watch it. I didn't appreciate that those elements were in the movie; it should have been PG.

If you're a fan of visual comedy and the simpleminded wonderment of Mr. Bean, you'll likely enjoy this holiday movie. If it wasn't for the language and gun fights, I'd buy it for my son/the family--but quite frankly, I'm still undecided if it's worth the purchase.",1196640000,4,1236,4.686635944700461

The movie was brilliant and family friendly (not often in combination) and Rowan was hilarious.  Who knew Willem Dafoe could be so funny?

2988563,4,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson returns as Mr. Bean, who just wants to go to the beach. After winning a raffle for a vacation package to lightmarish Cannes, France from pleasantly rainy England, Mr. Bean takes his complimentary camera to film the trip, immediately experiencing various hilarious mishaps, including dumping coffee on a laptop..., to misplacing his passport, train ticket, and inadvertently separating a boy and his father; wherein the two eventually become friends and cooperate together to raise money to contact the father and travel to Cannes.

With his trusty camcorder chronicling the trip, Poor Mr. Bean experiences Murphy's Law at every turn, but somehow always manages to emerge from various predicaments all the better. Other scenes include a grueling raw shrimp sea food luncheon while under the gaze of a condescending Maitre'D, chasing a chicken on a bicycle across the French countryside, becoming stranded {getting confined in an outhouse}, and taking part in a film production wherein Bean dresses as a Nazi soldier {whose goose-stepping antics get him quite literally stuck}, dancing for coins, and even cross-dressing!

While hitch-hiking, he meets a cute French girl named Sabine along the way, who just so happens to have a part in director ""Carson Clay's"" {Willem Defoe} boringly pretentious and exaggerated self-aggrandizing production at the Cannes film festival, ending up, through Mr. Bean's efforts, providing appropriate exposure for Sabine.

Finally, through all the obstacles, a joyously blissful Mr. Bean reaches the beach, and the picture in the brochure comes to life. Towards the end, the film strangely becomes a musical, probably as an expression to convey the impression of an erstwhile European production, and actually manages to grant the viewer the sensation of being a tourist overall.

While not quite as amusing as his adventure to America in the first Mr. Bean film, Mr. Bean's Holiday is still a welcomed, hilarious voyage into this most entertaining character. The more the better, in My opinion.

The DVD also contains documentary material with interviews with the cast members including Rowan Atkinson. I was quite delightfully surprised to find a special package combination with the DVD, including a Mr. Bean bobble-head from the folks at Funko {who also brought us the hula devil girl and the Mr. Burns bank, among other whimsical items}, who has now taken his place by the viewing monitor.

This movie gets a one-star rating only because zero or negative stars is not possible. This movie's humor seems to center on Mr. Bean doing his thing, oblivious to other people and ignoring their reactions. At least his TV shows had him reacting with scared little expressions or actions after he'd pulled his blunders.

You can take your saintly aunt Jemima to this one, and you need not fear to let your children, or grandchildren view it either.  It is a G and deserves the rating; there is literally nothing in it that is in any way objectionable.  Why can't other films accomplish this?

When my wife and I went to see ""Mr Bean's Holiday"" it was pouring down with rain outside.  It was the first day of school too.  Maybe that was the reason why there were only six in the movie theater to see this gem?  We were three couples, yet for all the small number there was regular, hearty laughter throughout  the whole performance.

I don't know why some reviewers found it uneven or disappointing.  It managed to have a lot of brand new material in it.  The on-location European filming gave added interest.  We never lost  track of the plot or lost interest in the action.

We're ordering one for ourselves (the wife and I) and one for the biggest of Bean fans among our grandchildren.

2988568,5,B000WOQKD0,"The Dick Van Dyke Show. The Lucy Show. The Odd Couple.

What on earth do these wonderful old T.V. shows have to do with Mr. Bean's Holiday?

Well, not a whole lot thematically, but there is one very significant tie between them. The classic shows mentioned above were not children's programs. They were prime-time comedy series aimed at adults. They were clean as a whistle for the most part, as shows then tended to be, but the subjects of the shows revolved around divorce, marital troubles, problems at the office etc.

Unfortunately, modern entertainment equates ""adult"" with sex and violence. In other words, the word adult has been appropriated. Nothing could possibly be funny, clever, inventive or exciting if there isn't at least some sex or controversy right? It's a pretty sad state when ""adult"" has come to mean ""15 year-old boy"" :/

Now before you roll your eyes, I am as far from being a prude as you can get. I own and admire scores of R-rated films, and listen to music that would make most ""hipsters"" hair curl with shock and disgust. But there was a time when writers actually had to be clever to get a laugh, imagine that. Any idiot can walk into a theater full of adolescents, drop the F-bomb and get roars of laughter, and do, now that was easy. The industry has gone from using salatious material to be thought-provoking (Kubrick, Scorsese) to relying on it for an easy thrill.

Well just when you thought that the art of being funny without body parts and fart jokes was a lost art, along comes Mr. Bean. Rowan Atkinson reminds us with this funny, charming film, that funny is funny. My 9-year-old roared with delight throughout the entire film, as did my wife and I. And the added kick was, it was the first time in a long, long time we did it as a family, without my wife holding the remote with a death-grip to skip over something. It was a nice, and far-too overdue feeling.

Of course there are several references thoughout the movie that will sail over the heads of most children, a scene satirizing a pretentious, arty filmmaker for instance (which was hilarious), but the lion's share of the old, almost silent film-style sight gags and elaborately choreographed Buster Keaton stunts (The amazing walk over a busy highway was pretty impressive), will entertain anyone with a bit of wonder left in them.

A previous reviewer believed that today's children would be bored by Mr. Bean's goofy antics. Sadly, these days he may be right. There are no CGI thingies crashing into each other, no underdressed teen girls chatting on cell phones at the mall, and believe it or not, no fart jokes.

Rowan Atkinson's facial expressions are priceless.  He only uses three non-English words... two are French, and one is Spanish but he believes it is French (""gracias"").  Everyone around him is serious, even when Mr. Bean is totally nuts. And, yes, there is a story line throughout the slapstick, dancing, lip-synching, and psycho-oyster behaviors.

3222377,3,B000WOQKD0,"The long-awaited second Bean movie, Mr. Bean's Holiday, has a running time of only 83 minutes -- or about 80 minutes too long, as one wag put it at the screening we attended.
One is either a fan of Mr. Bean or one is not, and as actor Rowan Atkinson himself has pointed out, Bean is not a favourite of critics because the humour is too simple. Something like that, anyway.
In Mr. Bean's Holiday, our hero wins a contest and his prize is a trip to Cannes. Whatever can go wrong on his travels does go wrong; he is taken for a child abductor, among other problems, and he wanders through the landscape with a Russian child in tow, having mistakenly separated the child from his father. Mr. Bean's misadventures are many.
He loses his tickets and passport, gets tossed off a train, chases chickens (don't ask) gets locked in a shed, rides a bike, wanders into the filming of an advertisement and sabotages a movie screening at Cannes.
There are a handful of very funny moments in the movie, most of them dedicated to making fun of pretentious movies and their filmmakers (represented by Willem Dafoe.)
Mr. Bean's holiday footage gets inserted into Dafoe's ridiculous film, to great comic effect. The sequences in Cannes are mostly amusing, and Mr. Bean even gets to meet a girl: Sabine (Emma de Caunes). His amateur filmmaking helps make her a star.

3222380,1,B000WOQKD0,"I am a huge fan of the British Television series ""Mr. Bean"", created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis (who would go on to write ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and write and direct ""Love, Actually). The series, available on DVD and shown on PBS stations from time to time, follows the adventures of Mr. Bean (Atkinson), a largely silent, slightly bitter, single British man, who finds himself in various predicaments. Because the character is largely silent, he gets into a variety of situations leading to a lot of physical comedy. And he is largely reminiscent of great comedians like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton.

A few years ago, they made a film called simply ""Bean"", which was released in Europe before it came to the United States. A huge hit, the film was scheduled for release in later summer here in America and quickly flopped. It's easy to see why the character is such a draw in Europe; because he almost never speaks, it isn't a lot of work to translate his dialogue for foreign countries. Everyone understands physical humor. ""Bean"" was a dreadful film. The story quickly builds a pretense of getting the character to Los Angeles where he interacts with his host family and their two `adorable' kids and Burt Reynolds plays a supporting role. The film chose to replay a number of situations from the series and added two kids, who could, presumably, relate to the overgrown child in Bean. It didn't work.

When I first saw the trailer for ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", the newest film featuring the Rowan Atkinson creation, I was intrigued. It seemed to be a thinly veiled re-working of the Jacques Tati classic ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" with the Bean character taking the place of Mr. Hulot. Jacques Tati's films are also significant for their sparing use of dialogue and it seemed like the translation might lead to more success.

I was very nave.

""Holiday"" starts promisingly. Bean (Atkinson) speeds his little Mini Cooper to a broken down church barely making the announcement of the winner of their big raffle. As it is June in England, the torrential rain is dampening everyone's sprits and Bean is especially eager to win an expense paid trip to the sunny beaches of Cannes. He wins and he has a couple of amusing moments at the beginning of the journey. After he arrives in Paris, and finds the train to Cannes, he asks a gentleman to take some video of him boarding the train. The gentleman misses the train and Bean soon realizes the man's young son has been left behind on the train. Bean realizes he has to help reunite them and they set off on a trip across France, trying to get to Cannes. Along the way, they cross paths with an American film director (Willem Dafoe) who is also on his way to the Cannes Film Festival and the young French actress (Emma de Caunes) he is courting.

""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" misfires on just about every count. Even the amusing situations he gets involved in on the train to Paris, at the beginning of his journey, are just that, amusing. They aren't so funny you will forever remember them forever, or so funny they redeem the film, they only manage to create a smile. The best of these is when Bean wanders into a restaurant at Gare Du Lyon, because he has some time to kill before taking the train to Cannes, he decides to eat a meal. He inadvertently orders a Platter Fruit De Mer from the Maitre' D (Jean Rochefort, ""The Man on the Train"") and is shocked to find a huge platter of oysters and large prawns, complete with eyes, delivered to his table. Atkinson is a gifted comedian with an extremely expressive face and we instantly feel his pain when he eats his first raw oyster.

But this same gifted comedian can't help make other scenes more than slightly amusing. For instance, he tires to amuse the boy on the train by pasting pieces of paper on his eyelids and tongue and make them move around. This is just creepy. Later, he interrupts a screening of a film at the Cannes Film Festival in a protracted bit of unfunny business, which points to a very obvious joke.

Why do these films fall so flat? It seems a shame they attempt to make these films appeals to such a broad audience. In each, Bean is paired with precocious children in a blatant attempt to both appeal to this demographic and point out the obvious comparisons between Bean's character and the children. ""Holiday"" is rated G because it contains nothing that could be considered even slightly racy or daring. But I think little kids will be bored by Bean's relatively low-key antics.

One of the great things about the show is Bean was usually a little bitter about how put upon he felt. He felt entitled to certain things and when he didn't get them, he became slightly exasperated. In the films, the attempts to make him universally appealing have robbed him of this aspect of his character and simply serve to make him boring.

There are two very funny moments in ""Holiday"". At one point, Bean begins to karaoke or pantomime to an aria from an opera as people walking through a French market stop to watch. Later, Willem Dafoe's American director premieres his latest film at the Cannes Film Festival and we get to see snippets of the overly pretentious piece of crap he has created and is so clearly in love with.

But these moments are few and far between and it takes a long time to get there and a long time after they happen until the film finally ends. When the film does finally end, you feel a sense of relief. You no longer need to wait, hoping something, anything funny might happen. Sure, it is a wait in vain, but you never give up hope.

""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" isn't funny enough, amusing enough or clever enough to warrant your money or time. That's sad because Rowan Atkinson is a very funny guy and Mr. Bean has provided some hilarious moments on his television series. Rent that on DVD instead.",1188172800,11,5841,4.590604026845638
3222381,3,B000WOQKD0,"Oh Mr. Bean, what are we going to do with you? For years Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean character has been a worldwide sensation. You'll always hear that laughter may be the universal cure for sickness, but to find something that everyone would find funny...now THAT is the challenge! Somehow, being a man of few words, Mr. Bean has been the universal character that people all over the world love. It's not hard to see why. I always found it impressive that a character who speaks so few words (if, indeed, he speaks at all) manages to make me laugh so hard I want to bust a gut. Comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chaplin/dp/B0000A9D2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chaplin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buster-Keaton/dp/B00005QW5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buster Keaton </a>&nbsp;are not uncalled for. In fact, they are actually a very accurate way of describing Mr. Bean, and his new movie ""Mr. Bean's Vacation."" I must admit, humor is not the easiest thing to write about. Likewise, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is not a movie I can easily describe because there isn't much to describe.

There is no story in this movie. There are some connecting events, but outside the fact that Bean wins a trip to Paris and is attempting to get a lost boy to the Cannes Film Festival, there really isn't much in terms of story. Heck, there isn't even much in terms of dialog. Unlike the previous Bean film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bean-The-Movie/dp/B00007AJF7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bean: The Movie</a>,"" Mr. Bean has returned to being his clumsy, mumbling self. No speeches, no conversing in American slang, just Bean messing up in every sticky situation he gets himself in. There are moments when the film stalls, but there are much more laughs to be found then groans. In fact, I'd venture to say there were at least three scenes that had me laughing so hard, my stomach actually began to hurt. You know the feeling right? You start laughing. Then you continue laughing. Then you can't stop laughing.

Then you grab your stomach in pain, trying to catch your breath, but you just can't stop laughing. Yeah, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" can be like that sometimes. In a rare leap of faith, most the dialog that DOES make it's way through the movie is in French, with subtitles! This makes sense since Bean is traveling with a French boy he can't communicate with, which is the source of many of the misunderstandings in this movie that results in gags. But it's also daring because the characters must come to understand each other through their body language instead of their speech, which makes the language in this movie universal. Indeed, the few times the subtitles do show up it won't matter, because even if the kids can't read the subtitles they can read the body language, and thus they still get the joke.

One thing I would keep an eye out for is a scene involving Bean eating sea food, which is most likely the single funniest scene I've seen at the movies all year so far. Now, I'm going to be honest, this is an easy movie to stomp on. The art of Chaplin and Keaton is no longer appreciated by most of today's audiences, who prefer character say the f word every other word in order to gain a laugh. People also like jokes with very perverse suggestions (sometimes very perverse dialog to go with it). The idea of getting people of all ages, of all ethnic's, of all religions to one screening of ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" and having them all laugh must sound like a foreign idea. The idea of paying $10.00 to see a movie that essentially has no story must at the very least sound strange. But ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is a very unique film in these regards.

Yes, it has flaws. There are moments where the film just drags, and the skits aren't sown together as flawlessly as they could be, but these points are moot. The bottom line is ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is pure comedy. Not all of it works, but most of it does. It's something the whole family can see and not be offended by. In fact, it may even be smarter then most of the big star ""comedies"" that we've seen released this year. It's not perfect, but if you're looking for a comedy, and especially one that you can bring your kids to, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is a winner.

3222386,3,B000WOQKD0,"I am a big fan of this movie and own the standard resolution release, saw the film in the theater and know it well.
So I was very disappointed that this release has been mercilessly edited. Some of the best comedy bits, and even
straight scenes have been cut. Some sight gags have been swapped with previously cut material.
Also, some key music has been changed, maybe because of copyright issues (even
cellphone jingles have been changed!)

I can only guess that the scenes were cut due to their exhibiting some of Mr. Bean's poor behavior, but that is
a big part of the appeal of the character! It is as if the person/people responsible have no idea what the character is about.
I highly doubt Rowan Atkinson had any input in these decisions.

I am very glad I have the first (non Blu-ray) release of this film as it was originally shown in American theaters.

I am hoping that there are other Blu-ray releases available with the original content, as the one I have appears to
be created for multiple markets due to all the various logos on the box. It could be that the cut content was to appease
a different countrie(s) rating board to retain a G rating. Just a guess.

There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this movie, really, but it does often feel empty and spacious, like we're all just going through the motions one last time. There's a requisite number of repackaged old skits from the character's long history, interspersed within a lightly curvy, family-friendly plot. Bean's awkward natural charisma is still in attendance, despite his curmudgeonly exterior, and he plays well alongside his two costars: a nearly-mute foreign boy and a stunning French beauty. The language barrier plays well into both relationships, as many of the masthead characters' best adventures play like a silent film. It's fine, I guess, and it certainly entertained my two young boys (we've watched it dozens of times since it went up for streaming on Netflix) but there's nothing remotely essential in here and I doubt I'll remember any of it in a few weeks' time.",1451347200,,974,5.170886075949367

3222634,4,B000WOQKD0,"Taking place ten years after BEAN THE MOVIE, Rowan Atkinson returns to portray Mr. Bean one final time in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY (Atkinson announced that this MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY would be the last story that he would do as Mr. Bean). The movie opens with Mr. Bean rushing to attend a charity auction and raffle. It's the big day of the big raffle and the big prize is an all-expense paid trip to the beaches at Cannes, France. Mr. Bean ends up winning the trip and is giddy as a school boy. Bean accidently takes a taxi and is dropped off at the wrong location. Using his trusty compass, he walks all the way back to the train station. While there he has an hour to wait until his next train arrives and he gets into some mischief in a restaurant. Bean eventually gets on the train and finds himself in the company of a Russian boy. He and his father were inadvertently separated at the station due to Mr. Bean. Much of the rest of the movie involves Mr. Bean trying to get the boy back to his father and make it to Cannes. Along the way he mimes Puccini's O mio babbiono caro to earn money; beats some Tour de France bicycle riders; works as an extra in big budget movie; meets a beautiful actress; and happens to become a hit at the Cannes film festival.

MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE. BEAN THE MOVIE seemed to be more focused on tying a bunch of Mr. Bean sketches together in one film and then arranging the story around those sketches. Although there are several Bean bits (both old and new) in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY seems to have been written as a story first and then had the bits added along the way. MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is just a far better story and one with a whole bunch more heart than BEAN THE MOVIE. There are some really funny parts (such as Mr. Bean trying to eat unshelled scampi or miming opera), but the movie also has a real tenderness to it. Mr. Bean really just wants to get to the beach, but he's also protective of the Russian boy he travels with. In some ways, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is the story of when Mr. Bean began to grow up.

Overall, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a very funny, heart-felt movie. It's a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE and is a fine way for Mr. Bean to say farewell.",1394841600,,2249,4.227906976744186
3222635,5,B000WOQKD0,I grew up watching Mr. Bean! I loved his show and all the funny things he did! I LOVE this movie just as much as the show!,1394582400,,122,3.5555555555555554
3222636,4,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson ought to get a medal for keeping his Mr. Bean character up to snuff a full decade after the 1997 ""Bean"" movie. We see the same general mixture of goofy facial expressions, awkward body language, and unusual gestures (well-intentioned and ill-intentioned, successful and unsuccessful) that will either be regarded as childishly immature or wondrously childlike. We see him re-plot a lost course using just a compass and a relentless focus that borders on that of an autistic savant. We see him regard an ambitious platter of French seafood with all the appeal of a root canal and bury some of it in an innocent bystander's purse. We see him accidentally make his own short film - and have it looking not half bad.

This movie is slicker than the 1997 original, and perhaps not as overtly ""feel good"" (but this may simply be a mark of evolving direction tastes), yet it still has a happy - if ludicrous - ending, and is still meant to basically be a family movie. I would say that between this film and the original, the plot of the original movie is probably much easier for the younger viewers to follow and keep track of, but there's nothing strenuously hard to follow in the sequel, either. There is some unmistakable continuity in the screenplay since Robin Driscoll was still involved, so the general consistency in style might be due in equal parts to the production team and Atkinson himself.

Some of the camera work is a little artsy, but this could be an inside joke, especially considering the awkwardness of an immature Brit character in France. I was happy to see a general lack of hand-held camera shots (except for the parts Bean shoots with his new toy, of course). This jittery technique tends to be a detriment to comedies, so I was happy to see that the production team didn't ""jump the shark"" on that one and give in to the supposed consensus.

Some people will complain that the premise isn't strong enough and the comedy is not exactly anything new. It's true, the comedic styles are very, very close to the schtick Atkinson has always used with Mr. Bean, but my question is why mess with a good thing? It basically boils down to this: you either understand Mr. Bean or you don't. Some people obviously do still love this character if you consider the box office figures it generated ($229 million for a $25 million budget - respectable compared to some movies, and not too shabby for a 90-minute comedy).",1394496000,,2441,4.6720930232558135
3222637,3,B000WOQKD0,"First of all the movie, is silly and delightful.  The whole family enjoyed Mr. Bean's crazy antics.  But, I only gave it 3 stars because I ordered it on Prime and it was to supposed to get to my house on Tuesday, but didn't arrive until Thursday. My daughter needed for a high school film review paper that she had to write.  We watched it on Amazon Prime first because it did not arrive in time.

So, I was hesitant to watch this, knowing how Mr. Bean gets into all sorts of trouble, and I am not one who laughs easily at others' misfortune or silliness.

The parts where Mr. Bean keeps missing all sorts of transport to get to Cannes (and keeping the poor little boy from also doing so) really made me feel frustrated!!!

Thankfully, things improve in the second half, the boy is darling, and all's well that ends well. :) Willem Dafoe is hysterical in his cameo role!  Hence the 4 stars.",1390435200,,670,4.379032258064516

3222692,5,B000WOQKD0,"Oh my goodness, this is one of my favorite comedies ever!  Rowan Atkinson is at his absolute best - a hilarious but lovable buffoon who wins a trip to the Riviera in a church raffle.  Brilliantly acted by Atkinson and the adorable Emma De Caunes.  Yes, parents, this one is safe to watch with the kids!  No nudity, suggestive content, or foul language.  It's clean.  So many family comedies these days are not funny or just plain stupid.  And who can stand another movie with anthropomorphized talking CGI animals, cars, planes, etc.?  Treat your family to something different.

There's not a lot of dialog in this movie - Atkinson is a master at expressing himself with body language, so few words are needed.  To get inside the head of the simpleton/savant Mr. Bean is a real riot.  The whole sequence where he loses his bus ticket and goes chasing a chicken through the French countryside on a bicycle is hilarious - even more so because a logical person would have realized that the bus has already left and so there's no point in chasing the chicken.  But not Mr. Bean - once he gets his mind set on something, a little thing like logic isn't going to slow him down.

It's actually a good thing that there isn't a lot of dialog in this film - you'll be laughing so hard you wouldn't hear it anyway!",1378166400,,1303,4.470338983050848

3222703,5,B000WOQKD0,"Iv recently become a big bean fan.
The tv show is hilarious, and both movies were good but not as good as the tv show.
The animated tv is funny and I surprisingly like it. I usually hate animated tv shows but this is different.
Only negative thing I will say about bean is they reuse scenes.
In the movie and the tv show bean puts a turkey on his head and cant get it off and runs around with it on. That's just one scene they used more than once, but there's more.

The whole bean-10/10
I loved this tv series, and I wish they made more episodes. I watch the entire series in a few hours, and loved very episode. One thing I don't get is why was there so few episode made? Why did they only make 1-2 episode a year?

Bean the movie-7/10
I really didn't like this movie that much. The plot wasn't good nor interesting but there was a bunch of bean moments which made up for the bad plot.

Bean the holiday-9/10
I really loved this movie. Unlike the first movie i enjoyed the story. Many scenes were great, and this is the closet thing to the orignal bean series.

Bean the animated series-7/10
I really didn't even want to watch this because of my dismay of animated series but I give it a chance and I do like it.
Many scenes in this series has been seen in the movies and the orignal.
Also each episode is only 11 minutes which I don't like.
Overall this is a great set for any beanies out there, but just a heads up you can watch both movies and both tv series on netflix.",1372204800,,1475,4.093425605536332
3222704,5,B000WOQKD0,Mr. Bean is everyman. We can all identify with his insecurities. This adventure in France is priceless. One of my favorite scenes is when he is serenading the public at an outdoor market. This film stresses the importance of communication on a visceral level. It is also a wonderful travel video and ad for France.,1370736000,,314,4.7272727272727275

3222708,5,B000WOQKD0,"Mr Bean's Holiday is light-hearted entertainment for persons who do not take themselves too seriously--and the musical numbers are painfully funny!

3222729,3,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean seemed truly hysterical and brilliant in the original TV series. Some of the funniest moments ever commited to film can be seen on the series. It's classic british comedy at it's best. However there is something about both Mr. bean films that just seem to fall flat in comparison. Somehow the films just don't seem to work as well. This second Bean film is certainly better than the first, but it never is as good as any of the TV episodes Atkinson made. There are moments in this one however that are truly hysterical, but there just seems to be something missing in these full length features. The obvious first thing that comes to mind is the absence of any studio audience chuckling and belly laughing to Bean's antics. The audience helps set the mood of this sort of comedy. I think the series also works well because of it's short 15 minute to 30 minute segments and it seems to work well that way. It's much more difficult to take a Bean episode and then lengthen one basic story into an 80 minute film and keep the good comedic ideas flowing well. In fact this film was funniest when it paid homage to Bean TV episodes from the past that might be familiar to some of us. The first full length feature was very odd. The way it turned out Bean seemed almost creepy and perverted rather than just innocently wierd. So over all though there were some good moments this film pretty much fails to convey the same classic comedy the original series had.",1367884800,,1480,4.485185185185185

What a kick I got out of watching the series, including some episodes I'd never seen. This set has the odd thing of including some Bean cartoon episodes.  I didn't watch them. I feel like that was foisted upon me. Does anyone who orders the real Mr. Bean series want to see the cartoon? I doubt it. Seems like advertising to me.

Even if you weren't a fan of the original movie ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is a complete 180 in terms of style.  It's not by chance that this was given a similar title to ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" as this movie also relies more on sight gags and visual humor rather than dialogue.  Thankfully, this fits in very well with the Mr. Bean character as he rarely talks.  Those who enjoyed the Mr. Bean TV shows should like this movie as well since the style is very similar to the classic TV shows.  But unlike ""Bean,"" this movie is not the same gags from the TV shows thrown into a movie script.

Don't expect this movie to be a stereotypical comedy that spoon-feeds you the jokes.  The style in this film is unlike anything else you'll see in American theaters today.

3222846,3,B000WOQKD0,"Those of you familiar with Rowan Atkin's Mr. Bean character will know that Bean is not a man of many words.  So how would you make a full-length feature film out of a virtually non-verbal man in a speaking environment?  The answer is to send him to a place where language, culture, and environmental factors allow him to interact by his own means.  In other words send him on a vacation from London to Cannes.

Although the English dialog left no difficulty for viewers to understand, a change of country made it easier for Bean to fit in.  So in a Borat-like manner he starts off for an adventure that would make even Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold look brilliant.  But unlike either character, Mr. Bean's innocence never varies.

That isn't to say that he doesn't wreak havoc along the way.  But even with his crazy antics and expressions, the film's beginning drags until he meets a young boy, about 11, whose father missed his train because he stepped on the platform to take a picture of Bean.  Of course the boy doesn't take to him at first, but they soon become unlikely buddies.  Although even these two become separated, but they somehow reunite, and Bean picks up a third party, a bit-part actress, along the way.

So you have a boy in search of his father, an actress in search of a career, and Mr. Bean in search of the ocean.  Naturally the climax occurs at the Cannes film festival where Bean alters an arrogant film-maker's entry, creating the funniest scene in the movie and a happy ending for one in all.  And how did this non-verbal man round off his vacation?  By leading the crowd into a song at the Cannes beach.

While the elements of a hilarious film, and even a hint of romance for Bean, were present, gestures that work in a half hour TV show can be redundant and predictable on the full screen.  The movie was definitely packed with action, and while it was not a laugh a minute, the dry commentary and ride to a conclusion somehow managed to hold my interest.",1285632000,,1984,4.5

3222870,2,B000WOQKD0,"How much you'll enjoy ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" will depend in large part on your tolerance for Rowan Atkninson, a rubber-faced comedian who, with his broad physical humor and near-wordless pantomime, harkens back - in style if not in quality - to the silent greats like Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, etc.

In this installment, the British Mr. Bean wins the top prize in a local raffle - an all-expenses-paid trip to the French Riviera.  The movie chronicles the havoc he leaves in his wake both on the way to his destination and in the South of France itself, culminating in a major ruckus at the Cannes Film Festival, no less (this is the best part of the movie, actually).

The problem is that none of it really plays very well as comedy.  After what feels like the longest credit sequence in motion picture history, Mr. Bean launches into a French restaurant bit that Lucille Ball had already done to perfection fifty years earlier.  Things don't get much better from that point on, as Bean races from one pratfall-ridden disaster to another throughout the course of the movie.  And, when all else fails, the filmmakers throw a hapless youngster - a boy who gets accidentally separated from his father at a train station - into the mix to turn this into Atkinson's own version of ""The Kid.""

Mr. Bean may be funny to some, but to me he's just annoying and creepy - the visual equivalent of nails on a chalkboard perhaps.  The grunting and groaning and monosyllabic muttering become unendurable over time, and the constant facial twitching and mugging for the camera don't do much to endear us to the character - or to the performer, for that matter - either.

As a source of laughter, this Bean character is certainly an acquired taste and I'm perfectly willing to concede that there is something in all this labored farce that I simply don`t relate to.  To each his own, I suppose.",1248566400,,1877,4.677811550151976

3222873,5,B000WOQKD0,"Whether or not you find this DVD hilarious or as thrilling as watching paint dry rather depends on how much a fan you are of Rowan Atkinson, the 1980s's British answer to Jerry Lewis. If you care about as much for either one as you would for having root-canal dentistry performed with a jack-hammer,  then you can skip this DVD entirely, and the rest of the review too. Although Mr. Bean, the near-to-silent, endlessly inventive, rubber-faced (and apparently rubber-limbed) every-schlub is a little quieter than Jerry Lewis, he is just as comically accident-prone.

After all, who else on earth could find himself with his foot caught on a tall clothing rack, above his head... on a French TV production set... while costumed as a WWII German soldier... because he was practicing a really, really enthusiastic goose-step... after being shanghaied as an extra. The film involved is a commercial for yogurt, by the way. What the logic is in that, I have no idea, although Mr. Bean subsequently manages to blow up the director.

The plot, such as it exists is gossamer thin, and in places reminiscent of the classic Mr. Hulot's Holiday, being almost entirely composed of sight gags and gentle pratfalls. Mr. Bean wins a charity raffle first prize; a camcorder and an all expense paid trip to the French Riviera.  He gets as far as Paris before the inevitable cascade of misfortune begins. In short order and in no particular order he manages to get his tie caught in a vending machine, fill an expensive handbag with raw oysters and causes a visiting Russian filmmaker to miss the train to Cannes. He also looses his bus ticket to a chicken, after miming a performance of  ""O Mio Bambino Caro"" in a French open-air market in concert with the young son of the aforementioned Russian filmmaker, and has his bicycle run over by a tank He does eventually manage to reach Cannes and the seaside that he has been dreaming of while his home movies of the trip win a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival ... don't ask me to explain how that happened, but be assured there is some gentle fun to be had in skewering self-indulgent movie directors. Don't miss Willem Dafoe's brief turn as an auteur filmmaker/movie star with a hilariously awful but artistic movie. Whatever else can be said about Willem Dafoe, he does have enough confidence to parody himself. And the locations, especially those shot in and around the South of France are beautiful, as gorgeous as an expensive coffee-table book.

Overall, Mr. Bean's Holiday is a gentle, old-fashioned comedy - the kind of family friendly comedy that is hardly ever made any more; it can hardly be more unlike something like ""Borat"" and still be on the same planet. Some bits that are funnier that others, but there is nothing mean, foul-mouthed or vulgar about ""Mr. Bean"".It will even bear watching over and over again. Extras include more than twenty minutes of scenes that were omitted from the finished film, and three aptly titled features: ""French Beans"", which followed some of the more elaborate set-pieces filmed in the Luberon locations, ""Beans in Cannes"", explained how the crew managed to film on location during the international film festival, and ""The Human Bean"" featured brief interviews and reminiscences with other cast members.",1241308800,3,3293,4.8819320214669055
3222874,5,B000WOQKD0,"Ever since a friend of mine told me to watch Mr. Bean on HBO back in the day, I have since loved every second of his hilarious mishaps. I was one of those people who didn't understand, when seeing commercials, what could possibly be so funny. The commercials kinda left out what the concept was. Someone earlier said american's tend to like fast comedies and bupring/fart jokes and whatever. I consider myself very critical of comedies. I don't care if it's ""dumb humor"" (humor that is dumb on purpose to make you laugh) I don't mind some gross humor, I don't care what kind it is, but as long as it's genuinely funny. So I love movies like Ghostbusters, Johnny Dangerously,Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Boy, My Fellow Americans, and Caddyshack. Even Rodney Dangerfield would be able to elevate a normally stupid movie and make me laugh out loud. Which, by the way, is the only way you should laugh. So in came Mr. Bean. I didn't know what to expect, but my friend up till then never steered me wrong. So I watched. At first I thought, this is a bit odd. And, then, even though I still had that same opinion, I realised I was laughing hysterically. He captured the silent clown comdey of chaplin, the classic facial expressions of someone like Lucille Ball, He also had his own style that is unable to be categorized. I was hooked. So anytime it came on I watched. Then the videos came out and i bought all the vhs tapes and eventually the Whole Bean on DVD which was upsetting because they edited out hilarious scenes. Not even sure why. They had plenty of room on the dvds to even add more:( but that's not mr. bean's fault that's the studio's. Anyway, the first mr bean movie wasn't really a mr. bean movie it's like they tried to make him mainstream. I would have preferred two hours of skits actually. Once u have mr. bean talking, u don't have mr bean, he would say stuff in the show but it was small stuff like his name or mentioning teddy etc.  He was not meant to be a mainstream character. He was meant to be someone who didn't fit in with the real world, hence the opening scene of the show in which he appeared to ""just fall to earth"". He was a boy in a man's body. He didn't act within the confines or rules of normalised society, we knew every thing he did was not appropriate or something a grown up man would actually do, that's what made it funny. As for Mr. Bean's holiday, even though it could have moved faster, it was still more true to the original. It's hard to say how mr bean should play out in a movie simply because he only did maybe ten or fifteen minutes at a time, and even then, it was random. Comedy, though doesn't need a plot to work. I hate when people say it does. All it needs is the setup. To say this movie doesn't make sense until the end, misses the point. It's all about Mr. Bean and the chaos he creates. This movie was more true to character than the first one though, and it shows. I would highly reccomend this one. Also I would reccomend mr. bean fans to check out ""the Thin Blue Line"" which is available on dvd in amazon, and ""Black Adder"" both are stylistically different than Mr. Bean but some of the best comdey I've ever seen come out of the uk and better than a lot of U.S. Released Stuff. Also, and no I'm not affiliated with Rowan Atkinson in anyway, LOL Buy the Rowan Atkinson LIVE DVD you will love it. IT's a mixture of standup and visual humor that will blow you away. Everyone I have watched it with me has been in tears by the end. Considering I only knew him as mr bean before watching this, I didn't know what to expect from a talking rowan atkinson, but he totally impressed me and, with comedy I'm not easily impressed.",1240012800,,3677,4.2982708933717575

It's always hard to understand why, when you really enjoy something, everybody else doesn't enjoy it also. However, I have to admit that Mr. Bean is clearly not everybody's cup of tea. My husband and I have loved him for years and were thrilled to show this movie to our two young sons and see them laugh riotously all the way through. We just got the dvd out and watched it again last night, and even after about 4 viewings, all of us were still laughing. Every time I watch this movie I see something else that I missed. I suspect that folks who dislike this movie may not have watched it closely enough, because we find nuances to the jokes every time we watch. Yes, Bean is just plain silly, getting laughs from food and general idiocy. But many of the gags work on several different levels, and if you listen carefully to the soundtrack and watch the screen closely, you may see things that will surprise you and add to your appreciation of the movie. Just last night, my husband burst out laughing at a joke he hadn't noticed before because he hadn't read a sub-title closely before. So I recommend you give Mr. Bean's Holiday a chance.

He is joined bya cast of great commedians taht support the odd story. Mr. Bean expresses himself with mime and he is a true master of this comedy art form using and updating many routines seen in the work of Buster Keaton, the Three Stooges, and even Mr. Magoo comics. The soundtrack is a bright commentary on the action with opera and classic French popular music integrated with some American pop from the 1970s.  I found the European perspective was refreshing compared to many American films that are too fast paced and lack subtle humor integrted with the outrageously silly. I strongly recommend the film.

3222878,5,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson ices the Mr. Bean cake with this charming film.  We meet an older, mellower Bean, without the moments of petty selfishness that brought an edge to his television shows.

However, even Mr. Atkinson could not weave an hour and a half of Bean sketches together without help.  His traveling companions carry the film from one moment of Bean mania to the next.  Young Max Baldry is brilliant as the lost child who can relate to Mr. Bean on his own level.  The audience is never certain who is rescuing whom.  Emma de Caunes is enchanting and provides an apt foil as the trusting starlet who befriends the hapless Bean.  I will watch this one again just to bask in her smile!

The story comes to a hilarious and satisfying conclusion as all the lives Bean has touched on his journey come together.

It might sound crazy for a film that's mostly mime, but you might want to watch this one with the subtitles on.  After all, most of the people are speaking French, the lost boy and his father speak Russian, and it's easy to miss some of the background humor if you're not a linguist.",1238630400,,1091,4.4646464646464645

3222890,3,B000WOQKD0,"Well, overall I'd say that I enjoyed this movie and got enough laughs out of it to make it worthwhile, but I wouldn't watch it again. I think you can only take so much of Rowan Atkinson's ""Mr. Bean."" A newcomer to him (believe-it-or-not), I found him a lot of fun in the first half of the film but, boy, this guy is tough to take in longer dosages. I wonder if others feel that way?

It's weird; the film was entertaining.....but I found myself looking at my watch a lot during the last 20 minutes, hoping it would end.  Atkinson's goofy faces are very funny at first but get tiresome after an hour.

It was a ""cute"" story, anyway, and certainly one the whole family could watch. There is nothing, language or sex-wise, that would offend anyone. This is just old-fashioned, almost silent-film-type slapstick comedy.  Actually I probably laughed more at the ultra- corny lines delivered by Willem Dafoe, whose character pokes fun at film makers.

The film, though, belongs to Atkinson who is in about every scene and hams it up to the max. If you laugh at his contorted facial expressions and limber body (check out his karaoke work!), you'll love the film. It's very lighthearted comedy and I wouldn't knock the innocence of it.",1237766400,,1228,4.614678899082569

3222896,4,B000WOQKD0,"""Mr. Bean: The Ultimate Collection""  is a seven-disc box set featuring the antics of Rowan Atkinson's alter- ego, the long-legged, goofy-looking guy who manages to create comic mayhem wherever he goes.  Mr. Bean, whom Atkinson describes as a child in a grown man's body, was created when Atkinson was a student at Oxford University.

Borrowing from silent film techniques, Bean never speaks, relying instead on facial expressions, sight gags, and slapstick to milk laughs.  Atkinson is Chaplinesque in the way he sets up gags, plants them, and then illustrates his mortification at how badly things have gone.  We feel sorry for his sad-sack ineptness, but still manage to laugh at his constant penchant for getting into awkward, frequently embarrassing fixes. I was reminded of Buster Keaton and even Lucille Ball, two folks who knew how to incorporate and use props comically.  Atkinson cites Jacques Tati's earlier character, Mr. Hulot, as another influence.

The box set contains all fourteen episodes of the original series and the two feature films, ""Bean: The Movie"" and ""Mr. Bean's Holiday.""  In addition, the set contains the animated series ""It's Not Easy Being Bean"" and ""Bean There, Done That.""
Bonus features include deleted scenes, never-before-seen-on-TV sketches, the documentary ""The Story of Bean,""  the 20-minute featurette ""Making of the Animated Series, a music video, and French versions of the feature films.",1230422400,89,1431,5.352678571428571

His character doesn't have to say much at all in this movie to get the viewer roaring, his facial expressions and movements are hilarious on their own.

and finally in response to the review and questions i have seen on here

hate to be the bearer of bad news so far it appears that it is the edited ver. even more so it looks to me as the set is a rehash the seven disc break down like this Mr. bean: vol 1,2,3 ( 3 discs ( thats the t.v. series ( looks to be the the whole bean because of the menus ),then you have bean: the movie( 1 disc ), Mr. bean's holiday( 1 disc ), then you have two disc from the animated series bean there, done that ( 1 disc ) and it's not easy being bean ( 1 disc ) so far I watched some of this the main missing scenes that people talked about from the whole bean being missing are m.i.a here too where he fights with the old lady over the chair in ""do-it yourself"" and where he guess the weight of the turkey in ""merry Christmas""

***Edit to point to the act that is rehash ever more so is vol 1-3 on this set have the same error in the order of episodes as The Whole Bean i am 99.9% sure that it is the whole bean but since I have never seen hat set myself I am still 00.1% not sure",1227398400,25,3173,5.45398773006135

Mr. Bean is a creature both naive and in touch with the unconscious wisdom to be in the ""NOW"" and with ""the force"".

In the train station he stops at nothing to get on without a ticket, and succeeds as a crawling sack of post - but on which train is he carried?

hope this helps.

3222916,5,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson is brilliant in his Mr. Bean role. I have never seen the first feature length film, but I have seen most (if not all) of his TV skits, and this film is in keeping with that tone. I loved the skits, and this film provided some of the biggest laughs I have had watching movies in a long time. Yes, there are some groans, but that is to be expected from visual comedy--take that alongside the belly laughs and be grateful!

The best scenes, in my opinion, were the lobster-eating scene, the street improv dance, and the movie showing. The lobster scene had me laughing so hard I almost hurt! In any case, the humor is clean and funny. If you don't like the character of Mr. Bean then don't waste your time, but if you think Mr. Bean is funny, you should like this movie.

Oh, and I watched a few of the extras too. They are insightful and worth watching. I don't always watch extras, but I would recommend these.",1222732800,,924,4.304597701149425
3222917,2,B000WOQKD0,"I found this film to be annoying for the most part. The film seemed a poor attempt to capture the comedy of the ""Pink Panther"" movies. Atkinson is no match for Sellers. The film is silly, insulting, and just plain dumb. Sorry I wasted an evening viewing this stinker.",1222646400,,267,4.469387755102041
3222918,5,B000WOQKD0,"Brilliant film, all the cleverness of a silent film with gorgeous cinematography, hysterically funny scenes, and a warm feel good ending.  5 stars!!!  Very family friendly, also.",1219968000,,178,5.555555555555555
3222919,4,B000WOQKD0,"The affable bumbling simpleton from England is back, this time rollicking his way to the south beaches of Cannes, Fr., and boy does he score a home run with one!

Mr. Bean wins a church raffle lottery and a trip to lovely Cannes. He also wins a never-to-parted-with handycam as part of the package win. These are enough and off he sets. However, where there's Mr. Bean, how can trouble be far behind...

There are twists and turns, in typical Mr. Bean style, and he's able to separate a son from his father, miss his train, lose his passport, miss the bus which he had to take instead of the train, drive with his eyelids clipped open, drive an egotistical movie director nuts, win over the heart of a budding French actress... the list can go on and on.

But then, you aren't here to read the story and all the pranks. You'd much rather see them. And, IMO, that would be an excellent idea!

The child in Mr. Bean (rather, the child Mr. Bean!) takes over this movie, and he's been able to deliver an even better package than the original movie years ago.

What separates a Mr. Bean movie from other slapstick creations of the genre is that he takes amusement (of the audience) to new heights, hitherto maintained by the likes of Sir Charles Chaplin. Whoever says really funny gags require good dialogue delivery doesn't know Mr. Bean.

Atkinson has made unbelievably funny moments out of otherwise drab sequences.. like (trying to) dial all the possible nos. to reach the boy's father, lip-syncing an opera on a sunny afternoon in a suburban French town marketplace, eating a seafood platter... in short, really a commendable job.

Why not 5 / 5 - you ask? Well, some of the sequences seemed a bit stretched out to me, and seemed to be placed not to further the story or the plot but just because they had been thought of in the first place and had to be accommodated.

Highly watchable nevertheless!
My favorite scene - the opera in the marketplace!!

Overall score: 4 / 5",1215302400,,1973,4.535211267605634
3222940,5,B000WOQKD0,"I truly enjoyed watching this film.  Having studied a number of foreign languages, I could understand almost all of the dialogue, and the use of different languages gave a lovely multicultural breadth.  The beautiful scenery added even more richness.

The casting I felt was particularly good.  You've got to have ordinary people whom Mr. Bean can play off of.  All of the characters were believable, especially the movie director and the young boy.  The young actress was too good to be true!  What a beautiful role she played!

Mr. Atkinson takes his work as a communicator very seriously, and the humor is only part of the equation.  For example, the lost bus ticket; what does it mean?  Is it merely a means to get him running after a chicken?  No.  I believe it represents the typically puny way we as human beings try to determine our existence, instead of trusting God to introduce us to the Sabines of this world and line up the bus roofs for us to walk on to the beach.

So, for the many who underappreciate this film, I would encourage them to watch it again, and purposefully look beyond the childishness.  The English tend to be quite subtle about things, and we Americans miss a lot more than we realize.",1214092800,,1217,4.6
3222941,1,B000WOQKD0,"Meh. I found Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean somewhat entertaining on the BBC (aired for me on PBS) in the early 90's, and even found the first film ""Bean"" with a few chuckles, but the silent well's run dry here. In it, Bean wins a contest to go to the Cannes Film Festival, yet only wants to go for the beach (?). Of course he goes on his usual unapoligetic destructive path and loses his tickets, way, and you know how it usually goes from there. But as with other road-movies, this one just seemed to go nowhere. And what bet did Willem Dafoe lose to have to appear in this one? Man, talk about career slumming, even though his character's movie-within-a-movie bit was a tad interesting (yet not funny either).

Another ""watched off the TiVo"" expierence. And with the delete button, it now feels relieved.",1214092800,,802,4.531034482758621
3222942,5,B000WOQKD0,This was a gift for my brother who just loves to watch this man! Very funny,1213574400,,75,3.75
3222943,4,B000WOQKD0,"Last fall I was on an airplane on a 12 hr flight from Hong Kong. This was one of the movies playing. There were quite a few Chinese students on the plane. It was amazing how this little Englishman had those people nearly falling out of their seats laughing. Two Chinese men sitting beside me were nearly crying from laughter.

I have to say this comedy was far better than the American crap I had to watch going over (License to Wed, Evan Almighty, Knocked up. )I didn't hear any out loud laughter from any of those.

The great thing about Mr. Bean movies is the subtlety (sometimes) of the comedy. Mr. Bean is a one-man demolition derby whose actions start a cascade of destruction and chaos that he himself is completely OBLIVIOUS to! (And when Mr. Bean gets near vehicles with motors, WATCH OUT!)

 As in the opening scenes where he spills coffee into a sleeping train passenger's PC and the person in the other seat gets blamed and a huge fight ensues off the train in which cops are running in from each direction. Mr. Bean has no idea what he's started.

 The other hilarious scene was when he was locked in the little outhouse building on the side of the road. The only way to get out is to get hit by a truck. This was not shown. He carried the building out of scene onto the highway. You hear a huge truck's horn, then a tremendous crash, wood flying. Leaving it to our imaginations was far funnier than seeing the explosion. Atkinson's comedic secret is he gets into little stupid things that we ourselves get into, but hope no one's around to see it. There's  no projectile vomiting or extreme toilet humor that American comedy writers (I use that term loosely) stoop to incessantly.

However, I wish there'd been more scenes like this. I hope Atkinson sticks to Mr. Bean and makes another movie, but please, MORE very clever sight gags like the two above.",1213315200,,1867,4.486725663716814
3222944,5,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson had made a genius tribute to Jacques Tati.  This film is howlingly funny and manages to poke fun at the filmmaking community as well.  There are immortal sequences--Mr. Bean's lunch at a seafood restaurant, Mr Bean begging with a boom box, Willem Dafoe's rendition of a narcissistic film director.  I never quite warmed to the Mr, Bean character previously although I absolutely adore Atkinson as the hapless BlackAdder.  This is a great movie and it can be thoroughly enjoyed by children as well as film sophisticates.",1213228800,,534,5.034090909090909
3222945,3,B000WOQKD0,"Mr. Bean is a very strange character and right away I was thinking.....what do you get when you take an English Pee Wee Herman crossed with Charlie Chaplin and then throw in a little of Jerri Blank(Strangers with Candy)?.....Mr. Beans!....that's who! This movie while funny is a bit too much ""Beans"" for me and I believe he is better in small doses. It's hard to believe the rave reviews of this film!?? It's not bad, but 5 stars?......is really pushing it. It's a funny little family film, nothing more. I rate it 2 1/2 stars for having a quirky little guy who doesn't add up to much more than a hill of ......Beans!

3222946,5,B000WOQKD0,"I am not a Mr. Bean's Fan. But this movie is irresistible. Funny, entertaining, and original. It is about Mr. Bean's efforts to get to his destination for a holiday. Of course nothing goes well. Except the comedy.",1210896000,,213,4.631578947368421
3222947,5,B000WOQKD0,"For Mr. Bean fans, this is the ultimate Bean movie.  As usual, Mr. Bean's lack of what society would call appropriate responses to life's foibles earns him the respect of the most unlikely of characters and lands him in clover by the end of the film. Some of the situations he is faced with, and his reactions and plans to fix things are just too funny.  And of course, there is Mr. Bean's enchanting childlike forge-ahead with a happy heart aura. There is one scene in the middle of the movie that is worth the entire BEAN!!  I cannot give this away as it would ruin it, but suffice it to say it takes place in a marketplace and involves street theatre.

So I was surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie about Mr. Bean basically traveling throughout France, and creating fun mayhem around it, how much I laugh at it. The gag in the restaurant goes back to silent cinema, but it's still effective.

3222990,3,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson plays the role of Mr. Bean, a middle-aged guy who behaves like a 9-year-old boy. Though Atkinson did an animated series of Bean 2002-03, ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" should be called the character's real comeback since the feature film in 1997, but I am afraid 10 years are too long for most of us.

""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" - the title is a reference to Jacque Tati's masterpiece ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" - is a series of comic sketches. These sketches are loosely tied together in a thin storyline about Mr. Bean who wins a ticket to Cannes and intends to see the beach no matter what happens on his way. It is partly a road movie that also involves a Russian kid, a French actress and a bicycle. Yes, it's Jacque Tati.

Though there are funny sight gags and clever jokes (Jean Rochefort eating a hamburger, or Willem Dafoe playing an egomaniac director, for example), some people might find these comic sketches not as funny as they should. I think I can understand their complaints (especially when they are avid fans of the original TV series) when these gags are done in a rather slack pace, or have been done somewhere else in a better form. You just don't find a tightly-constructed, ingenious script of the TV episodes, where funny things keep happening in the most unexpected way. I was not disappointed with the film very much, but I know ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is not the best of the Bean franchise.

Actually Rowan Atkinson did much funnier sketches on stage or in ""Blackadder"" and ""The Thin Blue Line."" Or the original ""Bean."" The film is not bad. It only reminds me of that fact, though.",1200700800,2,1600,4.607017543859649
3222991,3,B000WOQKD0,"There are many who know who Mr. Bean is. There are some who may not. Both would be pleased to see a movie featuring this character that is suitable for the whole family.

Actor Rowan Atkinson created the character of Mr. Bean for English television some time back. A hit overseas, the show became a staple much like Monty Python, winding up on PBS where enthusiastic viewers fell in love with the dimwitted character whose luck always seemed to turn out good.

In MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, we find Mr. Bean the lucky winner of the church raffle for an all expenses paid trip to the French Riviera, including a camcorder to record his trip. But just like the TV show, no trip for someone like Mr. Bean could turn out normal.

Along the way, Bean ends up accidentally separating a young boy and his father. To make amends, he attempts to help the two reunite. But again, we're talking Bean here, not a normal hero. The adventures of the pair as they try to make their way to Cannes where the boy's father is are hilarious. And all of them are captured on video as Bean shoots everything.

Atkinson is a great physical comedian, but not in a pratfall sort of way. He is one to put to use his entire body in emoting and drawing out an idea on screen. Bean is a character who sees the world through child like eyes, who never realizes he's done something wrong until afterwards. And yet this innocence is what makes him so endearing.

The idea of an Englishman stuck in France with no ability to speak the language helps rather than hinders the story. The strength of Atkinson's Mr. Bean has always been his physicality rather than wordplay and that strength if given a white canvas on which to paint with this set up.

While the laughs might be as funny as some found in the original series, there are plenty on hand. And these are jokes and situations that young and old alike can find something to laugh at.

Tolstoy it isn't but if you're looking for something to make you laugh, by all means give Mr. Bean a try. And once you get through this movie, check and see if the local video store has the series on hand as well. You'll be glad you did.",1200700800,2,2138,4.370277078085643

3222997,2,B000WOQKD0,"Whether you love him or hate him, Mr. Bean keeps doing what he know best--in this case, odd childish comedies. His formula feels dated, repetitive even preposterous, but despite all that, he has an international fan base that will never leave him, why would they? He brings more of the same in his new movie Mr. Bean's Holiday where our classic character has an adventure on his way to Cannes. It is a painful vacation experience for our friend, but satisfying at the end.

Brief Intro Story:
Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) wins a trip to Cannes (Southern France) and a small camcorder--courtesy of his local church. He is exciting and grabs his new prize at starts filming himself and things around him. As he travels, he meets a lost young boy who lost his father--who is also going to Cannes--for the famous film festival. As Bean travels with the boy, more crazy adventures awaits for them.

Review:
Unfortunately most of the drawbacks are created by Bean himself. We virtually watch more of the same sketches that we have seen since the creation of this character--actually his best work can be rented at your local video store. Also the scenes where Bean ""does his thing"" feel forced and sometimes just dead boring. How many times are we going to see a close-up of his face? Mr. Bean please stop recycling your own stuff. This vicious circle goes for about 80 percent of the film.

But not everything is lost for this British icon. Most of the Bean fans will probably appreciate the ""Nazi"" commercial sketch and last scene of the film which is the best of his peculiar vacation. This last theater reunion scene creates a moment of joy for the characters--especially for Bean--and probably for the audience as well. Willem Dafoe is quite entertaining as the egomaniac Actor/Director Carson Clay who sees ""talent"" in someone like Bean and praises his camera technique. In other words, most of the laughs are condensed in the last 15 minutes. It is shame that the audience has to wait until this moment to get some genuine laughs.

The Verdict:
Ten years is a long time to wait for a sequel--and it's predictable the way it was going to turn out. Mr. Bean's Holiday brings almost nothing new to the table after all this time. Few moments and a peachy ending did not save this new effort by the British star. It has some of his traditional work, but do a ""Bean"" search in YouTube and I guarantee that you'll have a much better time watching his classic early work on the internet.",1199664000,2,2477,4.648401826484018

As he plods along on his trip to Cannes, you can just see the gags coming a mile away. In fact, if they hadn't happened, I would've been disappointed. Yet, his bad luck was at times excruciating as you just know he's going to do... don't want to spoil the gags.

3223041,4,B000WOQKD0,"Our family approached Mr. Bean's Holiday with little or no Bean foreknowledge, I must admit. I know Rowan Atkinson from the Black Adder series, as well as his bid for immortality as the voice of Zazu in Disney's The Lion King. Bean shows had been recommended to me for years, as I love vintage comedy and British comedy. Having seen this film, now I don't know why I waited so long.

Mr. Bean's Holiday was a total delight from start to finish. At this time, I can't speak for other Bean shows and the first film, but my entire family could not get enough of this film. A sure sign a DVD is a hit is when my daughter watches it again the next day. She particularly enjoyed the ending, when Bean invades the Cannes Film Festival, goes into the projection booth and ... I shouldn't tell you, you have to see it.

We particularly liked the scenes in which Bean lip-synched in the park, begged for money in a train station. It even has a grand finale with a cast of seeming thousands. Like so many fun comedies, it's loaded with memorable set pieces to watch again and again, linked with a simple story line.

There is almost nothing for parents to worry about with this G-rated movie if their kids watch with them (even though it takes place on the Riviera), with the exception of two ""d"" words (in subtitles) and an outtake in which the leading lady lies down in the street in despair (there are no subtitles in the deleted scenes, and like as Ed Norton noted about Ralph Kramden, I don't speak French). I think she's acting out a scene). Bean has a tendency to walk away from disasters he has contrived, much like Laurel and Hardy did when they destroyed someone's house or something like that. it's all very ""cartoony"" in fact, Atkinson's mumbles remind me of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons (which I HIGHLY recommend on the new Warner DVD).

Rowan Atkinson's lovable Bean, with his his guttaral voice and his penchant for mishap is downright infectious.  Willem Dafoe's pretentious director was a hoot, too.  You haven't lived until you see his yogurt commercial as art film.  This film was released in the waning days of summer when studios routinely dump product on the market.  Don't be fooled.  This film is a real winner.",1197763200,,668,4.64957264957265
3223043,4,B000WOQKD0,"This is a normal Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) type movie, running approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes.  It begins with Mr. Bean's arrival in his little yellow Cooper-looking type car where the drawing will be held for an all-expenses paid holiday (what us Westerners call ""vacation"") to Cannes in the South of France, plus $200 Euro spending dollars and a Sony video camcorder.

Traveling by train from London to Cannes, Mr. Bean immediately begins causing havoc everywhere he goes.  One of the funniest scenes, in my opinion, was close to the beginning of the film when Mr. Bean eats a seafood platter consisting of raw oysters and langoustines.  But there are plenty more funny scenes as Mr. Bean, with little more than a word or two or a grunt, and an occasional ""Oui,"" coupled with gestures and facial expressions of a true comediac, makes his way through the challenges that only he can find in a simple all-expense paid holiday.  William Defoe also appears in the film as a Film Director, en route to the Cannes Film Festival.

Again, a typical Mr. Bean adventure.  If you have never seen Mr. Bean, he is pretty unique and is like watching a silent British comedy.  He does such goofy things and always gets himself into weird situations, and strange things happen to people around him.  From chasing a chicken, to an outhouse scene, to starting a brawl over a laptop, to eating a raw oyster, etc. etc. etc., Mr. Bean is a hoot!",1197504000,,1431,4.669322709163347

Johnny English was an enormous improvement. But Mr. Bean's Holiday is a joyous leap forward. The title recalls Mr. Hulot's Holiday and the film has the feel of a French film, which, as it takes place in France, makes it thoroughly delightful.

It's not simply a few Bean sight gags strung together. There's a gentle undercurrent that washes through the film, culminating, fittingly, on the beach at Cannes. The only movies that worked this well at a leisurely pace that I can recall are Vacation and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. This film manages to be simple and grand at the same time. Understated and clever (and when was the last time a film was understated?)

Even cartoons have forgotten what visual humor is about (for instance the vastly overwritten Simpsons Movie), but here, a classic clown remembers, and against all odds, takes us all on holiday.",1196726400,,1015,4.7942857142857145

3223047,3,B000WOQKD0,"We loved the slapstick elements of Mr. Bean's holiday...and perhaps Mr. Bean is an acquired taste. (For example, he tries oysters on a half shell at a fancy restaurant and pretends to eat them/like them for the snooty waiter. When no one's looking, he dumps the slimy stuff in a lady's purse without her knowing. When her phone, inside her purse, eventually rings--he panics.)

Some parts are a bit slow, but if you hang to the end, you'll find a surprisingly tight plot. I love how they tied it all together at the end (and Willem Dafoe was a marvelous sport!)

However, there was some cussing in the DVD, as well as scenes of faux war--including guns blazing. I'm not a prude--don't mind violence and language normally. HOWEVER, this movie is supposedly rated G, and so I figured there wouldn't be ANYTHING remotely objectionable about this movie...so I let my 9 year old son watch it. I didn't appreciate that those elements were in the movie; it should have been PG.

If you're a fan of visual comedy and the simpleminded wonderment of Mr. Bean, you'll likely enjoy this holiday movie. If it wasn't for the language and gun fights, I'd buy it for my son/the family--but quite frankly, I'm still undecided if it's worth the purchase.",1196640000,4,1236,4.686635944700461
3223058,5,B000WOQKD0,"Having never seen Mr. Bean before (only seeing Rowan in Johnny English), 5 minutes into the movie I was sure it was going to be pretty dumb.  After 20 minutes I thought it was pretty good.  By the the end of the movie, I was sure it was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. The movie was brilliant and family friendly (not often in combination) and Rowan was hilarious.  Who knew Willem Dafoe could be so funny?  The supporting cast was just right with lots of sight gags for everyone and enough subtle intelligent jokes for the adults.  No wonder it did $250M+ worldwide.  It is rumored this is the last Mr. Bean show.  Let's hope not!",1196640000,6,646,4.289256198347108

3223060,4,B000WOQKD0,"Rowan Atkinson returns as Mr. Bean, who just wants to go to the beach. After winning a raffle for a vacation package to lightmarish Cannes, France from pleasantly rainy England, Mr. Bean takes his complimentary camera to film the trip, immediately experiencing various hilarious mishaps, including dumping coffee on a laptop..., to misplacing his passport, train ticket, and inadvertently separating a boy and his father; wherein the two eventually become friends and cooperate together to raise money to contact the father and travel to Cannes.

With his trusty camcorder chronicling the trip, Poor Mr. Bean experiences Murphy's Law at every turn, but somehow always manages to emerge from various predicaments all the better. Other scenes include a grueling raw shrimp sea food luncheon while under the gaze of a condescending Maitre'D, chasing a chicken on a bicycle across the French countryside, becoming stranded {getting confined in an outhouse}, and taking part in a film production wherein Bean dresses as a Nazi soldier {whose goose-stepping antics get him quite literally stuck}, dancing for coins, and even cross-dressing!

While hitch-hiking, he meets a cute French girl named Sabine along the way, who just so happens to have a part in director ""Carson Clay's"" {Willem Defoe} boringly pretentious and exaggerated self-aggrandizing production at the Cannes film festival, ending up, through Mr. Bean's efforts, providing appropriate exposure for Sabine.

Finally, through all the obstacles, a joyously blissful Mr. Bean reaches the beach, and the picture in the brochure comes to life. Towards the end, the film strangely becomes a musical, probably as an expression to convey the impression of an erstwhile European production, and actually manages to grant the viewer the sensation of being a tourist overall.

While not quite as amusing as his adventure to America in the first Mr. Bean film, Mr. Bean's Holiday is still a welcomed, hilarious voyage into this most entertaining character. The more the better, in My opinion.

The DVD also contains documentary material with interviews with the cast members including Rowan Atkinson. I was quite delightfully surprised to find a special package combination with the DVD, including a Mr. Bean bobble-head from the folks at Funko {who also brought us the hula devil girl and the Mr. Burns bank, among other whimsical items}, who has now taken his place by the viewing monitor.

3223061,5,B000WOQKD0,"Rumor has it that this is the final performance of this character, which is sad.  I must say I loved the movie more than the first one (regardless of the jerk who kept talking in the theatre through the whole movie).  If you want a fun movie to see, check this one out!  Now I hope that there's another Black Adder in the near future....",1196294400,,337,4.153846153846154
3223062,1,B000WOQKD0,"I saw this movie in the theaters with others. We agreed to walk out on the movie about 30 minutes into the show. It's the only movie we all had ever walked out on. Terrible! This movie gets a one-star rating only because zero or negative stars is not possible. This movie's humor seems to center on Mr. Bean doing his thing, oblivious to other people and ignoring their reactions. At least his TV shows had him reacting with scared little expressions or actions after he'd pulled his blunders. He's unrepenetant and unreactive about his actions here and that makes the movie NOT FUNNY! It's like a joke with no punch line. Boring at best, and irritating most of the time.",1196035200,2,671,4.553719008264463
3223063,5,B000WOQKD0,"I've been waiting for a long time for a good Mr Bean movie. The first one i admit was a flop and didn't reflect a true Mr Bean character. If you love the show you'll love this movie. Rowan Atkinson is a comedic genius. He has little to say in this film but when he says anything it's helarious. I guess some people don't find it too funny, but if you're a Mr Bean fan you gotta see this film!",1196035200,,392,3.9125
3223064,5,B000WOQKD0,"Finally!  This movie is clean but brilliant and sheer entertainment.  You can take your saintly aunt Jemima to this one, and you need not fear to let your children, or grandchildren view it either.  It is a G and deserves the rating; there is literally nothing in it that is in any way objectionable.  Why can't other films accomplish this?

When my wife and I went to see ""Mr Bean's Holiday"" it was pouring down with rain outside.  It was the first day of school too.  Maybe that was the reason why there were only six in the movie theater to see this gem?  We were three couples, yet for all the small number there was regular, hearty laughter throughout  the whole performance.

I don't know why some reviewers found it uneven or disappointing.  It managed to have a lot of brand new material in it.  The on-location European filming gave added interest.  We never lost  track of the plot or lost interest in the action.

We're ordering one for ourselves (the wife and I) and one for the biggest of Bean fans among our grandchildren.

By the way every one of more than a dozen grandchildren has been absolutely delighted with Mr Bean and have asked to see the episodes from the TV series again and again, as well as the movie ""Bean"".  This one caps the lot in my opinion.",1195776000,16,1274,4.422413793103448
3223065,5,B000WOQKD0,"The Dick Van Dyke Show. The Lucy Show. The Odd Couple.

What on earth do these wonderful old T.V. shows have to do with Mr. Bean's Holiday?

Well, not a whole lot thematically, but there is one very significant tie between them. The classic shows mentioned above were not children's programs. They were prime-time comedy series aimed at adults. They were clean as a whistle for the most part, as shows then tended to be, but the subjects of the shows revolved around divorce, marital troubles, problems at the office etc.

Unfortunately, modern entertainment equates ""adult"" with sex and violence. In other words, the word adult has been appropriated. Nothing could possibly be funny, clever, inventive or exciting if there isn't at least some sex or controversy right? It's a pretty sad state when ""adult"" has come to mean ""15 year-old boy"" :/

Now before you roll your eyes, I am as far from being a prude as you can get. I own and admire scores of R-rated films, and listen to music that would make most ""hipsters"" hair curl with shock and disgust. But there was a time when writers actually had to be clever to get a laugh, imagine that. Any idiot can walk into a theater full of adolescents, drop the F-bomb and get roars of laughter, and do, now that was easy. The industry has gone from using salatious material to be thought-provoking (Kubrick, Scorsese) to relying on it for an easy thrill.

Well just when you thought that the art of being funny without body parts and fart jokes was a lost art, along comes Mr. Bean. Rowan Atkinson reminds us with this funny, charming film, that funny is funny. My 9-year-old roared with delight throughout the entire film, as did my wife and I. And the added kick was, it was the first time in a long, long time we did it as a family, without my wife holding the remote with a death-grip to skip over something. It was a nice, and far-too overdue feeling.

Of course there are several references thoughout the movie that will sail over the heads of most children, a scene satirizing a pretentious, arty filmmaker for instance (which was hilarious), but the lion's share of the old, almost silent film-style sight gags and elaborately choreographed Buster Keaton stunts (The amazing walk over a busy highway was pretty impressive), will entertain anyone with a bit of wonder left in them.

A previous reviewer believed that today's children would be bored by Mr. Bean's goofy antics. Sadly, these days he may be right. There are no CGI thingies crashing into each other, no underdressed teen girls chatting on cell phones at the mall, and believe it or not, no fart jokes. But you know something, when I watched my daughter laugh and applaud at the end, I think ...maybe he's wrong.",1195603200,90,2727,4.656964656964657
3223066,5,B000WOQKD0,"Much, much better than the original Bean movie, in part because Atkinson is a lot funnier when people around him don't talk too much (unlike the first entry). In fact, every thing I disliked about the first Bean movie was corrected here. THIS is what I was hoping for the first time around.
It takes a while for the film to get going but a couple of the set-pieces had me laughing with tears as did the ending. I've watched the fantastic, final musical number countless times.
Not to say this is Citizen Kane but certainly a great time at the movies.",1193875200,27,550,4.401960784313726
