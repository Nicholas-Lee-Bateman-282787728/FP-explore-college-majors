8474873,5,B005IP8ARW,"The color is amazing, it even has a slight glitter to it when the light hits it right. Its easy to use and understand from the on screen direction and the instruction manual. I have an old AE-1 and the lenses obviously don't fit, I did buy an adaptor and its perfect! The camera uses the old lenses just as well as the new one!",1363219200,,327,4.046153846153846

8474875,3,B005IP8ARW,"Pentax has offered digital slr bodies in navy, white, red and black so when I saw the Canon had an entry system in red I purchased. Last week it arrived -- I charged the battery, loaded a memory card and put on the neck strap. It's been turned on but no photos taken. The camera feels cheap compared to my Pentax K-x. Both Canon and Pentax have a long history of providing all levels of photographers well-constructed cameras and lenses so I'm just disappointed.",1357776000,,462,4.511904761904762
