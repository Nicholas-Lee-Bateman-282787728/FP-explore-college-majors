This is not an all-encompassing telling of the Mahabharata, but it gets the job done.  There's a surrealistic quality about it that reminds me a little of The Wizard of Oz.  I've been able to watch it multiple times. Draupadi and Arjun look like they stepped right out of a classic Indian painting.  In fact, the casting and costuming is terrific. Truly, this is a Bollywood treasure, and a delight for vintage film fans!",1430006400,,573,4.989473684210527
