8561094,5,B00B1TJVVI,"A real pleasure to watch a master trapper at work. Mark is a great educator and this video sure did teach me a lot. I had a feeling I should be relocating the scat and Mark confirmed it. It's great that he shows the sets/assembly and then shows the catch the next morning in the same set/s, yeah he's a pro. I will buy part 2 and highly recommend part 1, happy Trapping!!!",1516406400,,372,4.109589041095891
