3019434,5,B000YABIRK,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one waiting for this short-lived, wonderful series to come out on DVD. This was a great show, unwisely cancelled as so many good series fall prey to. Why can't the producers release a DVD set for sale? Seems like many would profit from it and we the fans would have a worthwhile experience instead of the horrible programs that are pushed in our faces. If anyone in cable TV decides to purchase the rights to show this series in syndication that would suffice too!",1401321600,17,493,4.428571428571429
3019435,5,B000YABIRK,"I just don't get it, that this has still NOT been released.  There are some major crap shows that go to dvd before season finishes & we can't get this brilliant (decent) show on dvd.  Anyone got any idea who we can hassle?????",1392422400,2,226,4.232558139534884

3019437,5,B000YABIRK,"Wathed this show lots of times when being aired on HDTV and i love it. Its rare that you get such a great feel good tv-show.
I wish they would release the two seasons as a complete Blu-ray series boxset.",1391904000,4,203,4.1
3019438,5,B000YABIRK,"I want to see it again. It was one of those cancelled shows that I still miss and wish to see again.

3019439,5,B000YABIRK,Please put this on DVD already! There's almost nowhere to watch this series and I'm dying to watch it again; it was so good!,1372809600,11,124,4.208333333333333
3019440,5,B000YABIRK,"I can't believe some of the crap that has come out on DVD and this series still hasn't.  What is wrong with these people!!  Bad enough they cancel one of the best TV series ever, but then they won't let the loyal fans buy their own DVD and mourn appropriately in the privacy of their own homes.",1362268800,14,294,4.140350877192983

3019472,5,B000YABIRK,"When is this wonderful series finally going to come out on DVD?  (Legitimately.)  I found a website selling copies out of China (bootleg), which I decided against, because the site was not secure, and I did not want a crap copy.  Warner Brothers.....WAKE UP!  People want to see this show on DVD!",1357603200,7,296,4.634615384615385
3019473,5,B000YABIRK,"Seriously, this is a 'to whom it may concern;' please put this series on DVD. Even though the ending was a cliffhanger, who cares? It wouldn't be the first time. It seems like every other damn show makes it to DVD one season or not ergo - put this one out already! I'm with another reviewer who says she still misses the show. These characters (and actors) were so great.
And I never come on here to chime in for C----t's sake.",1348790400,14,427,4.219512195121951
3019474,5,B000YABIRK,"You have to wonder about our viewing public. With the growing number of ""Reality TV"" programs, I'm finding less reason to sit in front of the ""Tube"" each evening. Fortunately the cable channels are doing a decent job of putting out quality programming. Maybe they could bring back ""Men in Trees"", please!",1345680000,6,304,4.865384615384615

I absoulutely L O V E - the idiot$$$ (cuz its about the money) make a stupid decision. You root for every character and you want to see them happy. I absolutely
love Ann Heche's character (Marin) and her questions that fits into the story line from her radio show....sigh - Oh Well - Like we say here in St. Croix ""chuups""",1344211200,5,401,4.025
3019476,5,B000YABIRK,"This show was so interesting.  I liked that the story went back and forth between Alaska and New York City. I loved all of the quirky characters in Elmo, Alaska.  Please, give us the DVD's.",1326326400,10,189,4.371428571428571

3019478,5,B000YABIRK,Several of my friends and myself watched Men In Trees faithfully while it was on the air and have been checking and rechecking ever since it was cancelled to purchase the dvd...only to find that it has still not been realeased on dvd.  We are still very hopeful that someone in charge of dvd creations will have the good sense to release this show...it took way too long for Ally McBeal to be made into dvd and we are hoping it won't be the same case for Men in Trees.,1322697600,6,468,4.2
3019479,5,B000YABIRK,My friends and myself have been waiting since Men In Trees was taken off the air for it to come out on dvd...we really enjoyed this show and couldn't believe it when it was cancelled.  Please release it on dvd so we can purchase the set.,1322697600,6,237,4.1521739130434785
3019480,5,B000YABIRK,"I loved this show & everyone in it.  It was such a breath of fresh air.  Loved everything about it.  What a good looking cast to boot!!!  When this was pulled off the air I was in shock!  The one show I couldn't wait to see and loved watching with great stories and beautiful scenery was dropped?  Are you kidding me???  What 107 people reviewed it and everyone gives it 5 stars.... Yeah, that's a show to dump and lets keep Cougar Town on.... Yeah, some good thinking there.  Well anyway, I can't wait till it comes out on DVD because I'll be the first online to buy it.  Lets keep our fingers crossed they put us out of our misery soon!  Can't wait to lay my eyes on Plowman again....  ; )",1322438400,8,691,4.120300751879699
3019551,5,B000YABIRK,"It is really unfortunate that ABC was willing to dump a well written, thoroughly entertaining show like Men in Trees.  But to leave fans of this show waiting for so long to see it on DVD is ridiculous.  Men in Trees encompassed the perfect combination of talented writers and great actors who had true chemistry together. Hopefully we will get to see it on DVD soon.",1321747200,10,366,4.53030303030303
3019552,5,B000YABIRK,"Just really surprised it was cancelled.  It was well on the way to being another 'Northern Exposure' success story.

DVD please - we've waited too long!",1321747200,6,152,4.8076923076923075

3019554,5,B000YABIRK,"Hi, I'm from Australia.  What a great show, light,funny and just plane enjoyable. I have been waiting patiently for this to come out on DVD. What is the holdup, Why is it taking so long??????? I just don't understand, as there has been other shows that have come after it, and you can buy it on DVD.  Can someone just say, yes or no that it will be released on DVD.

I've seen less written and acted shows that get DVD's out right away.  What's going on?  A wonderful show that was well written and well acted by great actors and no DVD....To the powers that be Come on and make it happen!!!",1309737600,,352,4.208955223880597
3019557,5,B000YABIRK,I couldn't agree more......I just wish the net work would release it on dvd already!!!!!!!!!!!! What's the hold up people. They obviously didn't know when the had a good thing going! Why is it that I can buy a t.v. show that's 30 years off the air or more and I'm still waiting for the Network to bring out MIT - which is only four years off the air! Comon already! Put the series on DVD!!!!!!,1301011200,2,393,4.184210526315789
3019558,5,B000YABIRK,"Seeing as how I am currently overseas, this was the only item that I requested for Christmas this year from my family.  All seasons...and  what do you know, still waiting!  I don't understand why it is taking so long for ABC to get this out in DVD form for all of the world to get there hands on.  It was the best show ever!!!  I am thirty something and loved watching this show!  The relationships made, the setting, EVERYTHING was amazing!!!  What more do we, the public, have to do to get this show out there?",1291852800,2,512,4.270833333333333
3019559,5,B000YABIRK,"I can't understand why this is not being released on DVD. It was a very light-hearted, funny and highly entertaining show. How much longer will we have to wait?",1291075200,,160,4.551724137931035
3019560,5,B000YABIRK,"Bring this back !! Figures they'd take off the best show on tv. Gee, no exploding heads , no zombies !! take it off !! we need action !! How about a show that has people actually involved in real life situations and have to work them out by TALKING ABOUT IT in person ! There's a novel idea.",1277769600,3,291,3.9491525423728815
3019591,5,B000YABIRK,"I'm surprised Lifetime or one of the satellite networks don't run MEN IN TREES as reruns, like they did Felicity for years.  I had a Tivo with a DVD back then and have a couple episodes saved, and it's great to watch the few I have. But would give anything to see the series again, even better would like to see it picked up and continued by Showtime or HBO. Please release the DVD's, or rerun them in the Summer  on one of the Networks.",1275436800,4,437,4.129411764705883
3019592,4,B000YABIRK,"That's what I just did. I complained to them about this. If you want to see this series on DVD one day, I suggest all of you do the same. Together we are strong. ;)",1274140800,2,164,3.7142857142857144
3019593,5,B000YABIRK,"Good grief, it's now 2012 and this show is still not available on DVD!!! Other canceled shows, like Life on Mars, appeared immediately.  Where is this one??? They booted it all over the schedule, so I couldn't find it half the time, then canceled it and added insult to injury by not releasing it. Could it be because it's a subtle, quirky relationship-driven drama, rather than action or shock driven? There's nothing like it on television since either. A whole audience is being ignored by the powers that be.  Get with it!  I'll buy it!",1263254400,6,539,4.652631578947369
3019594,5,B000YABIRK,"Why is it taking soooooooooooo long to release this awesome show on DVD? Seriously, it's ridiculous!",1252022400,,100,5.3125
3019595,5,B000YABIRK,"I really, really want the DVD of both seasons--anyone know when they will be available????  Please hurry-my birthday is in July, and if I could have ANY PRESENT I wanted--it would be Men in Trees on DVD - both seasons.",1240444800,,218,4.45
3019596,5,B000YABIRK,"OK, I'll be honest up front... it's a bit sappy at times. It's a bit simple when it needs to be. But this comes from a GUY who LOVES television! And while I understand that networks do certain things for certain reasons, I will NEVER understand why Men in Trees was ever given the boot. It didn't perform as well as ABC would liked it to have. But, that given - ABC never gave it a fair time spot.

The point is, ABC, this was one of your more clever, well-written shows, and you cancelled it! Oh... that's right... You, ABC, didn't own the rights to it.

Enough said.

At least give fans (and your money belt!) the opportunity to purchase Men in Trees as a whole, as it was meant to be.",1237248000,2,687,4.150375939849624
3019597,5,B000YABIRK,I was so disappointed when MIT was cancelled. I looked forward to it every week. I am tired of all the crime and reality shows that fill up the airwaves. My only consolation will be to own the DVD's when they are finally available. I just wish there were more seasons to enjoy.,1236816000,,277,4.245283018867925
3019598,5,B000YABIRK,"This show should have never been cancelled. It was a charming show that I always looked forward to watching. The characters were lovable, and the stories were interesting. It was funny, well written and a joy to watch.",1235865600,,218,4.7631578947368425
3019599,5,B000YABIRK,"Just another bad decision by ABC. It is as if good shows with excellent writing are trash?! I can't believe how many friends of mine loved this show as well as myself, how could they can it???? As soon as the dvd comes out, I am in line for it!
A wonderful story of a town full of interesting characters.",1234742400,2,304,4.083333333333333
3019600,5,B000YABIRK,Finally not one of those fake reality shows. Touching story. Excellent script. And they CANCELLED it. Go figure. Really want to see it again and again.,1231891200,2,151,4.846153846153846
3019641,5,B000YABIRK,I was so very sad that this show was canceled.  Loved the characters.  I am still waiting for a DVD of episodes.,1230336000,,112,4.045454545454546
3019642,5,B000YABIRK,I faithfully followed this show for every episode. It made me laugh every week and I loved it.  The show had many followers and ABC messed up when they cancelled it.  I'll buy the DVD as soon as it's released.  ABC may realize they messed up when they see the sales..but doubt it..they don't make their decisions based on their viewers preferences--clearly.,1229472000,,357,4.725806451612903
3019643,5,B000YABIRK,I WAS REALLY UPSET WHEN MIT WAS CANCELED & NOW BOSTON LEGAL IS IN IT'S FINAL SEASON. ABC MUST BE REALLY CRAZY TO CANCEL THESE 2 ADULT SHOWS!,1227830400,2,140,4.035714285714286
3019644,5,B000YABIRK,"Why????????  It was the best show on TV!  These characters were warm, funny and sweet...I just can't believe it!  I hope it comes out on DVD so I can watch it over and over!  Dumb move ABC!  Makes me want to boycott their other shows, but they wouldn't even care! Idiots!",1224201600,3,271,4.235294117647059
3019645,5,B000YABIRK,"Once again the powers that be at ABC, cancelled another great and most enjoyable show.  Men in Trees was somewhat similar to 'Northern Exposure' with all the quirky characters that you grow to love and associate with.  Perhaps the higher ups at ABC will bring MIT back.

I was shocked and in dis-belief at the news of ABC cancelling a great show like MIT's.. goes to show you the type of people they have running their network.. or lack of ability.. I wish HBO had been the network.. they can handle interesting qwirking entertainment.. ABC is looking more for the 20 year olds.. lets make a rad car and drive really fast kind of show..

3019649,5,B000YABIRK,"With the growing interest in all things Alaskan, this seems like a good time to consider bringing back Men in Trees.  Of course I think any time would be good time to bring back a great show.  It isn't as though ABC offered any other quality programming in its place.  Men In Trees was an intelligent funny show replaced by lazy reality TV that required no writing or plot.  Presumably it costs more to make a show that requires acting, but then you get the added benefit of having people actually watch, enjoy and appreciate your show.  I loved this series.  After MIT's cancellation, I stopped watching TV.  I didn't think there was anything else on TV that compared.  Please release a DVD of MIT's two seasons.  I'd rather rewatch the original shows than do without it.",1220227200,3,772,4.576642335766423

Wonderful glimpses into complex yet beautiful relationships between people.  I would often laugh so hard during the episodes that tears would stream down my face.  My friend Kirsten and I talked about and reviewed each show even though we are thousands of miles apart.  Since the show has been cancelled I refuse to watch the mindless, senseless and plotless shows on TV currently.  I get my news from the newspaper now thank you ABC for that.  Please release Men in Trees on DVD.  At least let me have access to one of THE BEST TV shows EVER!!!  By the way, Scott Elrod AKA 'Cash' you are one of the MOST beautiful men I have ever seen!

3019706,5,B000YABIRK,"SO SAD its been cancelled :-( Maybe if the network had kept it on the same night and time instead of constantly moving it around they would have had the ratings they 'require' to keep one of the best shows ever on the air!!

ABC dug the grave for this show with all the schedule changes.  Well, at least I don't have to pay another cable bill.  Hopefully we can buy the series...I'd be happy to watch these episodes over and over.  Thanks to the writers and actors for bringing us such great TV!!

3019709,5,B000YABIRK,"This was the best series on television! It is the only thing besides the news I watch. I hope ABC really comes to regret this decision. It is not often you find a show with the wit, character, sweetness, and hilarity of Men in Trees. With its memorable, believable and very likeable characters, its beautiful camera work and a quick wit that has not been seen on television since the end of Frasier, Men in Trees will truly be missed. 10 to 1, chances are ABC will decide to replace our beloved show with another worn out, pointless and insipid reality TV show. I certainly wish someone else would pick up the show, but until then we're stuck without.",1215388800,11,651,4.4789915966386555
3019710,5,B000YABIRK,"This one of the best series I have ever seen. The characters and the stories are very well written. The cast is just amazing.
It's really bad ABC cancelled the show. I wish they created the dvds now. I wanna buy them.
They are showing MEN IN TREES in Italy too and a lot of people felt in love with Merin and Jack and the rest of the group.
DVD please now!",1215129600,4,356,3.9583333333333335
3019751,5,B000YABIRK,"Men in Trees is a show of high caliber which unfortunately, has been cancelled.  I was saddened and baffled as to how a show that is so well-written, with a cast of obvious talent, has been taken from viewers.  I have been a faithful viewer of the show since its beginning (although it was hard to keep track of with so many changes in its schedule).  I am very much looking forward to the release of the DVD as I now find (again) nothing worth watching on network television.  I'm sorry, am I to think that Super Nanny (which is now on MIT's Wednesday night timeslot) is a viable replacement?  Please network executives, realize that your viewer population is not completely dumbed down by reality TV, and that many of us refuse to watch it.  Your taking of MIT off the air was a huge mistake.  It could have brought your network many accolades if only you had provided a consistent time slot for it.  Thank goodness for DVD players, as now my only way to watch quality television is on disc.  How sad.",1213747200,4,1003,4.407608695652174

Unfortunately, ABC switched it around so much I think I missed half the episodes because I never knew when it was going to be on....thank goodness for DVD's!!

People are so sick of blood, guts, murder, sex, etc. but I guess that's what these networks need to rake in the money. So sad that all the clean, wholesome and entertaining programs are gone. Cancelling ""Friday Night Lights"" is another one of ABC's mistakes.  We are absolutely heartbroken that they cancelled MIT. We understand that the Execs at ABC liked MIT but apparently did not have the guts to save it.  Too bad, so sad.  And we wonder what is wrong with the world today.  Greed and money driven.  HOW SAD!",1213574400,4,670,4.6752136752136755
3019754,5,B000YABIRK,I have been searching for a Men In Trees DVD for a year now - ever since I missed just one episode (sob). I will be checking back often for a DVD set. I don't like many shows on TV these days. Men in Trees will be sorely missed.,1213574400,3,228,3.673469387755102
3019755,5,B000YABIRK,"I fell in love with this show from the first airing and just watched the ""Series Finale""  The premature ending of this show is a loss for quality television.

""Men in Trees"" was a combination of two of my favorite shows, ""Northern Exposure"" and ""Sex and the City.""  You wouldn't think it would work, but it did and the contrasts were what made it so lovely.

It is interesting with the recent success of the ""Sex and the City"" Movie and the sudden (duh!) awareness that there is an audience out there of women want to see good stories about relationships and experiences we relate to, that the powers that be at ABC wouldn't give at least a little pause about the cancellation of this show.  This shows future unfortunately was doomed when it was put on it's first hiatus for no apparent reason other than putting a lesser quality show on.

I love good reality tv (hello Amazing Race!) as much as anyone, but honestly commercial television is becoming such a wasteland.  This was one of the few outposts of quality and it will be sorely missed.

I really hope they at least have the sense to put this on DVD.

Last but not least, I want to say a something about Anne Heche.  I wasn't a fan of hers prior to this show, but I became one.  I know, like a lot of people out there, I was definitely influenced by her perceived public behavior.  But you know what? I really liked her as Marin and I really like the chemistry between her and James Tupper.  It wasn't surprising that they fell for each other.  Who knows the truth and really, it doesn't matter, because she is an interesting actress and I look forward to seeing what she does next. ,",1213401600,4,1642,4.376237623762377

I can't see wasting my money on a place of my own when I spend a lot of time with my family.)  ANYWAY, My family is very traditional and there are not many shows that we watch together, since most shows are reality - most of which we can't stand anymore.  All the other shows are based around the same content: sex, murder, bad/foul language, crime, etc.  Most are riddled with off-color jokes or people in bed and it has just gotten real old.  I remember being a little kid and how I couldn't wait to get older so that I could stay up late to watch tv with my parents.  Now I avoid it like the plague.  Until the last few years, when Men in Trees and a few (very few) other shows came on that weren't pushing the envelpoe in every episode.  We were able to keep up with the schedule changes because the TIVO god made sure that we didn't miss an episode.  The day I found out that this show had gotten cancelled I called my mother and we cried.  It was like we were losing a friend.  This show had created a bond between my mother and I that we had lost some time ago.  We didn't have to argue with my father about watching the show, since he enjoyed it too.  He would never admit it, but he always paused or rewinded the TV to make sure my mother didn't miss a second; even though he was the one leaving the room at the time.  I remember reading an article not long ago about how the iPod was going to change the way we watched tv.  How consumers would be able to pay for individual episodes of their favorite shows.  I would not hesitate to buy episodes of Men in Trees every week.  Hopefully the producers of the show will keep this in mind and we'll all be able to see MIT again real soon!

3019850,5,B000YABIRK,"Each show was an extremely entertaining hour of television that packs a talented cast, who work very well, collectively, together with intelligent writing and sometimes humorous scenarious, to result in a clean television show.  It had been labled a ""dramedy"", by TV Guide.  It was a show that really made the hour seem to pass in only 15 minutes.  Some scenes are more adult in nature, and some dialogue is too, so I would not let the kids watch it, but definitely a show you could sit and watch with a friend or spouse and just enjoy.  It's not tawdry, nor cheap, rather, it's how real life might actually be in a small town in Alaska.  Lots of variety in the types of characters in the ensemble as well as the story lines that the writers give them.

The Networks continue to fail to produce/support intelligent television. Well written, produced, and acted, the network only had to support the new show with a decent time slot and advertise it to the public and it would have produced the ratings the network was looking for.  The fan base was huge.  But starting the show out following Grey's Anatomy (Thursday @ 10) was a good start they chose to tinker with.  They took it off for a while for October Road, moved the time slot, moved the night, etc... and the audience couldn't keep up with where to find the show next because ABC didn't advertise it.

Never the less, there would be a very small amount of redemption in the network's poor decision, if they were to release this on CD; all shows.  There were some shows that writer Jenny Bicks said were ""in the can"", from season 1, which, she said in her blog, would be shown in Season 2.  MIT fans know how that never happened.  So bring all the shows onto CD and, like the title of the Kinks disk says, ""Give The People What They Want"".  Watch it if you can.

With its memorable, believable and very likeable characters, its beautiful camera work and a quick wit that has not been seen on television since the end of Frasier, Men in Trees will truly be missed. 10 to 1, chances are ABC will decide to replace our beloved show with another worn out, pointless and insipid reality TV show.

I was saddened and baffled as to how a show that is so well-written, with a cast of obvious talent, has been taken from viewers.  I have been a faithful viewer of the show since its beginning (although it was hard to keep track of with so many changes in its schedule).  I am very much looking forward to the release of the DVD as I now find (again) nothing worth watching on network television.  I'm sorry, am I to think that Super Nanny (which is now on MIT's Wednesday night timeslot) is a viable replacement?  Please network executives, realize that your viewer population is not completely dumbed down by reality TV, and that many of us refuse to watch it.  Your taking of MIT off the air was a huge mistake.  It could have brought your network many accolades if only you had provided a consistent time slot for it.

Cancelling ""Friday Night Lights"" is another one of ABC's mistakes.  We are absolutely heartbroken that they cancelled MIT.

3254252,5,B000YABIRK,"I fell in love with this show from the first airing and just watched the ""Series Finale""  The premature ending of this show is a loss for quality television.

""Men in Trees"" was a combination of two of my favorite shows, ""Northern Exposure"" and ""Sex and the City.""  You wouldn't think it would work, but it did and the contrasts were what made it so lovely.

It is interesting with the recent success of the ""Sex and the City"" Movie and the sudden (duh!) awareness that there is an audience out there of women want to see good stories about relationships and experiences we relate to, that the powers that be at ABC wouldn't give at least a little pause about the cancellation of this show.  This shows future unfortunately was doomed when it was put on it's first hiatus for no apparent reason other than putting a lesser quality show on.

I love good reality tv (hello Amazing Race!) as much as anyone, but honestly commercial television is becoming such a wasteland.  This was one of the few outposts of quality and it will be sorely missed.

I really hope they at least have the sense to put this on DVD.

Last but not least, I want to say a something about Anne Heche.  I wasn't a fan of hers prior to this show, but I became one.  I know, like a lot of people out there, I was definitely influenced by her perceived public behavior.  But you know what? I really liked her as Marin and I really like the chemistry between her and James Tupper.  It wasn't surprising that they fell for each other.  Who knows the truth and really, it doesn't matter, because she is an interesting actress and I look forward to seeing what she does next. ,",1213401600,4,1642,4.376237623762377

I can't see wasting my money on a place of my own when I spend a lot of time with my family.)  ANYWAY, My family is very traditional and there are not many shows that we watch together, since most shows are reality - most of which we can't stand anymore.  All the other shows are based around the same content: sex, murder, bad/foul language, crime, etc.  Most are riddled with off-color jokes or people in bed and it has just gotten real old.  I remember being a little kid and how I couldn't wait to get older so that I could stay up late to watch tv with my parents.  Now I avoid it like the plague.  Until the last few years, when Men in Trees and a few (very few) other shows came on that weren't pushing the envelpoe in every episode.  We were able to keep up with the schedule changes because the TIVO god made sure that we didn't miss an episode.  The day I found out that this show had gotten cancelled I called my mother and we cried.  It was like we were losing a friend.  This show had created a bond between my mother and I that we had lost some time ago.  We didn't have to argue with my father about watching the show, since he enjoyed it too.  He would never admit it, but he always paused or rewinded the TV to make sure my mother didn't miss a second; even though he was the one leaving the room at the time.  I remember reading an article not long ago about how the iPod was going to change the way we watched tv.  How consumers would be able to pay for individual episodes of their favorite shows.  I would not hesitate to buy episodes of Men in Trees every week.  Hopefully the producers of the show will keep this in mind and we'll all be able to see MIT again real soon!

3254347,5,B000YABIRK,"Each show was an extremely entertaining hour of television that packs a talented cast, who work very well, collectively, together with intelligent writing and sometimes humorous scenarious, to result in a clean television show.  It had been labled a ""dramedy"", by TV Guide.  It was a show that really made the hour seem to pass in only 15 minutes.  Some scenes are more adult in nature, and some dialogue is too, so I would not let the kids watch it, but definitely a show you could sit and watch with a friend or spouse and just enjoy.  It's not tawdry, nor cheap, rather, it's how real life might actually be in a small town in Alaska.  Lots of variety in the types of characters in the ensemble as well as the story lines that the writers give them.

The Networks continue to fail to produce/support intelligent television. Well written, produced, and acted, the network only had to support the new show with a decent time slot and advertise it to the public and it would have produced the ratings the network was looking for.  The fan base was huge.  But starting the show out following Grey's Anatomy (Thursday @ 10) was a good start they chose to tinker with.  They took it off for a while for October Road, moved the time slot, moved the night, etc... and the audience couldn't keep up with where to find the show next because ABC didn't advertise it.

Never the less, there would be a very small amount of redemption in the network's poor decision, if they were to release this on CD; all shows.  There were some shows that writer Jenny Bicks said were ""in the can"", from season 1, which, she said in her blog, would be shown in Season 2.  MIT fans know how that never happened.

3254504,5,B000YABIRK,"'MEN IN TREES' examplifies a show that makes you reflect on life after each viewing. The show's format is not overly intense...it is warm, lighthearted and oftentimes funny but touching and meaningful. Its colorful blend of characters alone is entertaining but the way these Elmo, Alaska residents (and guests) handle life's challenges is what makes this show tick. I look forward to each episode's ""lesson"" in life.

I look forward to the release of the DVD!!!!!!!!",1195948800,96,466,5.131578947368421
