8482947,3,B005Q477RY,"The collectable poster art clearly sets the critical priorities here: this is genuine three-strip 1948 Technicolor (closely supervised by Natalie Kalmus and the Seattleite Morgan Padelford), fully saturated and eye-poppingly gorgeous, particularly on the Great Smoky Mountains locations in North Carolina and Tennessee. Winton C. Hoch (SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON) and Lionel Lindon supervised the cinematography, and further links to John Ford will pop up in the credits. The scenic Appalachians notwithstanding, the setting is ""Lebanon Valley"" in Jones County, Mississippi, unique in seceding first from the Union and then rebelliously seceding yet again in neutrality from its CSA parent state.

James H. Street found this ripe material for a novel, and this film's diffuse screenplay was ginned up by Alan Le May, soon to write the source novel for Ford's masterpiece THE SEARCHERS. Le May was particularly sensitive to outcast and anomalous social groups, and this script is packed with droll references, usually voiced by journalist Van Heflin, to ""you people"" or ""those people"" of the neutral County of Jones. I'm not sure secessionist folks spoke in quite this vernacular, but the disrespect implied by marginalizing ""you people"" or ""those people"" continues to ring frighteningly true today. The film is unusual in being entirely about moneyed Southern Anglo elites and blithely skirts the complex slavery issue, and its real companions are not GWTW but the 1957 oddities BAND OF ANGELS and RAINTREE COUNTY.

It is kind of a weird place, this Mississippi-in-the-Smokies, since the cast list enumerates Heflin, Susan Hayward, Boris Karloff, Julie London and Ford mainstay Ward Bond, in that order. More familiar Ford regulars, the ancient Russell Simpson and Arthur Shields, drift aimlessly into and out of the storyline, as regrettably so does wonderful Julie London who gets too little screen time. The large cast's sole African-American is the intriguing Ruby Dandridge, tetchy stage mother of Dorothy. By Universal standards this is a huge and expensive cast, and the very routine director of record George Marshall (an almost exact contemporary of John Ford but with a lesser poetic pedigree) cannot control it effectively. The final reels' battle scenes are very well managed, however, and this classical Technicolor is so luscious you could eat it with a spoon or bathe in it, as Miss Hayward revealingly does in the waterfall sequence. ""These people"" may be stubbornly different but they are terrifically photogenic, poster Southerners subject to larger forces (such as Kalmus Technicolor) beyond their control.",1464912000,2,2623,5.426470588235294

8482949,4,B005Q477RY,"film version of the second of author James Streets 4 novels about the civil war/Dabney family.  Was a BIG movie in 48.  Fast moving, well done, and entertaining. Van and Susan doing pretty good ""Clark and Scarlett."" Picture quality lacking since it's a VHS transfer. It crys for a blu-ray,  but that ain't gonna happen. BTW, it's directed by George Marshall.",1416614400,,358,4.836065573770492
8482950,2,B005Q477RY,"I was hoping to receive this movie for a long time, because I remembered it from about fifty years ago. The film is as good as I remembered it. But,and here it comes. The picture quality is unbelievebly bad, not to say rotten. It contains numeros stops. And on the lower left corner I have seen at least ten time the TNT sign. My guess is, that it is a lousy copy from a TNT TV-showing. I am not blaming you people of Amazon.com. ButI want you to know what happend to me in clear plain words and how I feel about it. And believe me, I am not exagerating. The picture quality is realy lousy !!! And just the same it would be a< very interesting moivie if the picture quality would only be bearable. It`is a good thing you are outof copies. Don`t buy from the same source anymore is my advice.",1348704000,16,791,4.142857142857143
