8518348,5,B007JJTM3Q,"This 66-minute DVD features just some of the performances at the 2009 Rockwell benefit concert from the 02 Arena in London, England. The concert benefits music therapy programs in the UK.

There are 14 performances by a diverse roster of music artists. The lead off act - the band Razorlight - was new to me and I enjoyed them though they are your basic rock band with a male lead singer. But next up is the highlight of the DVD (at least for me) and enough reason to get this disc for the three songs alone: Robert Plant. This is not the Led Zep Plant or the Alison Krauss-partnered Plant. As he says in his intro. ""It's experimental"" and ""at least out on the edge"". Starting off with ""Black Dog"", Plant is supported by an African ""banjo"" player and an African drummer, who get the song into a ""groove"" with the electric bass player. Next up is the 1932 blues ""Fixin' to Die"", this time with an African ""fiddle"" and then Plant joining in on blues harp!. Last up in Plant's set is the Led Zep classic ""Whole Lotta Love"" with that African fiddle again, but this time there's a Chinese sound. If this sounds unique, it is, and it's wonderful!

Following Plant is Joss Stone, who belts out two soul numbers as though she was born black  in Memphis (rather than being born white in Kent, UK). Another soulful singer from the UK - though twice as old as Stone - Tom Jones performs his hit ""It's Not Unusual"" and then ""Sex Bob"" (though I think he's a bit old for that last number) . Stone returns to join Jones for ""It's your Thing"", making like British Otis and Carla.

David Gray changes the pace with his hit ""Babylon"" accompanied by an attractive female string quartet ( Escala), who - unfortunately - are barely audible in the sound mix. He then goes solo.

The ""Finale"" is the Beatles' ""Let it Be"" sung by many in the cast -though Plant and Gray are missing. And there are a few performers I couldn't identify who must have been at the concert but are not included in their solo gigs.

The credits state that the concert was a production of ""ABC Productions"" and hint that it may have been recorded by a German company. There are also credits for the ""Interview Segments"", though this DVD has no interviews. It's possible that the DVD is an abridged version of a longer concert recording, and I, for one, would love to have seen the rest.

The camera work is well done and the sound is great. The image is sharp. What more could you ask for? (WE, as I said, the full concert.)

There's a lot to like on this DVD which seems to have gotten very little coverage. As more me, I love it!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
