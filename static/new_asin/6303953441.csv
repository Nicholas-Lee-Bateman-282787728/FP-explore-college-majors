752352,5,6303953441,"Universal Pictures presents ""SASKATCHEWAN"" (30 March 1954) (87 mins/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Alan Walbridge Ladd was an American film actor appeared in dozens of films in bits and small roles, including Citizen Kane --- These barely kept him and his household afloat --- He had married a high-school acquaintance, Midge Harrold, with whom he had a son, Alan Ladd, Jr

Ladd married his agent/manager and former movie actress Sue Carol in 1942 --- It was at this point that Carol found a vehicle which made Ladd's career, ""This Gun for Hire"" --- His performance as a hitman with a conscience made him a sensation --- Ladd went on to become one of Paramount Pictures' most popular stars --- A brief timeout for military service with the United States Army Air Force's First Motion Picture Unit did not diminish his popularity --- None of his subsequent films of the 1940s were as notable as ""This Gun for Hire"", but he did appear to good effect in Raymond Chandler's story ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946) alongside the similarly diminutive Veronica Lake (5'2"" or 1.57 m), with whom he had been paired in ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942) --- His Captain Carey, U.S.A. (1950) was notable for its soundtrack containing Nat King Cole's classic song, ""Mona Lisa"".

He formed his own production companies for film and radio and starred in his own syndicated series ""Box 13"", which ran from 1948 to 1949 --- In 1956, Ladd proposed a television series based on his radio series ""Box 13"". The idea didn't sell. Ladd himself had played his ""Box 13"" character Dan Holiday in the ""Committed"" episode of ""General Electric Theater"" (1953) on television. In 1963, Ladd said he hoped to reunite several of his 1940s era co-stars, including William Bendix and Veronica Lake, for a big screen version of ""Box 13"" --- He and Veronica Lake made seven movies together: ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946), ""Duffy's Tavern"" (1945), ""The Glass Key"" (1942), ""Saigon"" (1948), ""Star Spangled Rhythm"" (1942), ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942) and ""Variety Girl"" (1947). ""In Variety Girl"" (1947), ""Star Spangled Rhythm"" (1942) and ""Duffy's Tavern"" (1945), they appear as themselves.

Ladd became most famous for his title role as a gunslinger in the classic 1953 western ""Shane"" --- Ladd made the Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll 3 times, in 1947, 1953 and 1954 --- Alan Ladd has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street --- His handprint appears in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater, in Hollywood -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

752353,4,6303953441,"Saskatchewan follows Ladd as a Canadian mountie who has an Indian half-brother, and has to deal with a foolish commanding officer, a beautiful wagon train massacre survivor, played by Shelley Winters, and a vengeful marshal, played by Hugh O'Brian, who has taken Winters prisoner. All of this is buttresed by renegade Sioux Indians from the states hoping to force the Canadian Cree Indians into an alliance.

The movie moves along nicely with plenty of action and romance, but the lushly rugged Canandian scenery is as much the star of this film as Ladd. This film will prove to be a pleasant diversion for any Western lover, Ladd lover, or Canadian Rockies lover.",1147996800,18,664,4.928571428571429

752474,5,6303953441,"I remembered this movie from my earlier years.  I couldn't remember the name but I knew it took place in Canada.  So when I saw the movie Saskatchewan being advertised on Amazon, I decided to buy it.  And to my glee, it was that movie from my past.  It's a wonderful movie that doesn't rely on excessive violence to tell the story.",1443916800,,331,4.290322580645161
752475,5,6303953441,"I have waited so long to see this released on DVD and my VHS version was all but worn out.  This allowed me to see it the way I remember with all the full color and details.

752477,5,6303953441,"I am a great lover of western movies and a collector of them. Saskatchewan I saw in 1954. It has been the SINGLE most influential movie of my life. I have never seen it since 1954 when I saw it as a ten year old boy. Then I bought this movie in this review and it was not cheap! I kept a notebook(diary) since 1953 and having looked carefully at that and my notes on Saskatchewan which I had spelled wrong as a ten year old...I decided I had to have this movie! I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The DVD is sharp and the soundtrack intact. I really appreciated every aspect of the film. I cannot recommend it any higher! This is a lovely story, well done all the way around and makes the Canadian Mounted Police look good and is I believe a Canadian treasure! The scenery alone is awesome. The storyline is also excellent. With Shane I think this movie is an absolute must for a western movie buff! I do think this movie is somewhat more positive in mood than Shane. The movie I bought and thought I was reviewing was the DVD!!!  I had no difficulty with the DVD on my player! This is a perfect storyline to me! I have quite studied the Raoul Walsh who directed this movie in the life of Pancho Villa....and the portrayal of the young Pancho by Raoul Walsh. So I think this movie is very special.",1433289600,4,1286,4.227642276422764
752478,5,6303953441,"Saskatchewan"" is one of Alan Ladd's best roles as a Canadian Mounted Policeman. Great scenes with much beauty and also action packed! I highly recommend A+++++",1433116800,,159,5.153846153846154

752519,5,6303953441,You have to understand the reason this movie is so important to me is because my father had a bit part in it and until now I couldn't find it on DVD. The other movie he was in with was much easier to find so when I saw it at amazon I immediately ordered 3 copies for my family. PS if you like old westerns it is a pretty good movie shot here in the Canadian Rockies.,1422403200,,366,3.7662337662337664
752520,5,6303953441,Excellent movie from the 1950's. Its American and Canadian Indians against Alan Ladd and his Canadian Mounties. Its a rip roaring western that no movie lover should miss. Story is fast paced. The color is beautiful. Well worth the money and time spent.,1420848000,,252,4.883720930232558
752521,3,6303953441,"I was glad to be able to get the movie, and as usual the transfer of the picture was good, but the old time pan and scan for a cinemascope movie does not work well. the background which is spectacular is damaged by this process.",1417392000,,228,4.088888888888889
752522,4,6303953441,"I've always been an Alan Ladd fan since I first saw Shane.  This is a pretty rare movie not seen too often. Others have commented on the scenery as beautiful (I agree especially since this movie is in color). All in all, this was a nice movie that pits ""street smarts"" against ""Military training"".",1417305600,,297,4.5

752598,1,6303953441,"This is a really cool movie I saw years ago. Recently, I bought this and 3 other westerns from Amazon, and could not get them to play in my DVD/Blue Ray entertainment system. I returned them and Amazon sent me a replacement, but that one didn't work either. All other movies I've bought from Amazon play perfectly. Quite a disappointment, because I would like to see this again someday. The good news is that Amazon was very prompt in having the movies returned and my account credited. Would still like to see them, though!",1404086400,4,524,4.585106382978723
752599,5,6303953441,"Great western and the scenery was spectacular.  This is one of those Royal Canadian Mounties movies where the Indians should win but don't.  Alan Ladd is great, Of course.  If you like westerns get this one.",1404000000,,207,4.694444444444445

752601,4,6303953441,"These Manufactured DVD's on Demand are hit and miss. I tried to watch this in one of my later purchased DVD players and it would not play, was rejected. I was lucky enough to have another more recent, bluray player to use and it played fine. I seem to always be taking a chance with these On Demand DVD's. I have had trouble with a few of them in the past. I almost had to return this one, but since it played fine in one out of my two players I will keep it. As for the movie itself, With the video portion, a bit shaky on the credits and in the first part of the movie but it did clean up nicely as it went along. I would recommend this for purchase but maybe after a price drop. Another issue with these On Demand disc's is that they seem to be a bit pricey than they should. I was willing to pay the $20 because I had seen this movie many times before and liked it. I wouldn't take a chance on a blind buy at this price and get stuck with some movie that I didn't like. All in All, a good purchase, but be warned that it did not play in one of my two DVD players. Maybe you will have better luck with that.",1393977600,13,1110,3.8728070175438596
