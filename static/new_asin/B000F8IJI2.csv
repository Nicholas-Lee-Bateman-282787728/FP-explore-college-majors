8119040,3,B000F8IJI2,"AMERICA'S BASEBALL LEGENDS is recorded in SP mode and HiFi sound. Most of the vintage film, kinescope and TV videotape clips used here are at best of ""fair"" quality; quite a few are pretty awful-looking. An anonymous narrator quickly runs through a list of prominent ballplayers while heavy-on-rhythm upbeat synthesized orchestrations play underneath. (Not available on DVD)
Total running time: 58:30
