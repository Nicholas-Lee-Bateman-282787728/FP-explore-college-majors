8020784,5,B00022PYNO,"l had this Marilyn Monroe biography on VHS, recorded off TV when it was aired some eight years ago. I had watched it so many times that it was falling to pieces. I was overjoyed when I found it on DVD, so I ordered it. This is the ultimate Marilyn biography. It is very informative, hitting all her career highlights, and discussing her personal life in detail. However, I do wish there had been more discussion concerning her earlier movies, the ones prior to 1951. Other than this, I have absolutely no complaints. Whenever I'm bored I can always count on this DVD to entertain. I love Marilyn, and I love this biography!",1448668800,,623,4.522123893805309
8020785,5,B00022PYNO,"There are only a handful of good video biographies on Marilyn and this is definitely one of them. Labeled ""The Official Studio Biography"" from 1996, it does a great job of presenting Marilyn in a forthright and accurate portrayal. Her successes and flaws are talked about here by fellow actors and people who knew her, including her first husband Jim Dougherty, Eli Wallach, Don Murray, James Haspiel, Hugh Hefner, Gloria Steinem, Sheree North, Susan Strasberg, and her stand in, Evelyn Moriarty.

The documentary itself is about 91 minutes long, and then you have 20 Theatrical Trailers that are pretty good in image quality.
Included is also some snippets of her last film ""Something's Got To Give"" with Dean Martin.
The DVD quality is good, better than most on the market today. I give it high marks for well done. Even the menu is great with music and easy selections. I've taken some photos of it below ~",1426377600,4,909,4.789808917197452

8020789,5,B00022PYNO,"Best and well made of many documentries.  I bought 4 others recently, they just look like garage edited 3rd rate copies of most stuff already available in many other works.  This REAL FOX release is just great.  It only lacks ""slant""  on the possible homocide of Marilyn.",1141516800,9,271,4.702127659574468
8020790,4,B00022PYNO,"Rather than ramble on about Marilyn Monroe's tragic rise and fall, a story that many know very well, I'll keep my comments to the documentary presentation itself.  This ""official studio biography"" of Marilyn, distributed by 20th Century Fox, deserves credit for presenting a much more forthright biography of this carefully crafted show business creation than one might expect from a studio that held her contract for so many years.  Fox was fairly balanced in presenting Marilyn in many different lights:  glamorous, vulnerable, ambitious, beloved, exploited and sadly insecure.  There are many interviews with Marilyn's friends, fellow actors, columnists, and other celebrities of the time.  Narrator Peter Graves does an excellent job.  Given the numerous television tributes available, this documentary still had a number of things that I either wasn't aware of, or had never seen before.

Here's are the elements of the biography which I found most noteworthy:

- Interviews with Marilyn's first husband James Dougherty

- A video snippet of Marilyn's first movie appearance

- The story behind the 1949 nude photo that made it into the first issue of Playboy

- Much of the song ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" from ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""

- Newsreel-type video from her performances before American soldiers in Korea

- Film footage from Marilyn's divorce press conference

- Interviews with Evelyn Moriarty, Marilyn's stand-in

- Film footage of the ""Happy Birthday"" song for JFK, an event to which Marilyn was so late that it took numerous introductions by actor Peter Lawford (JFK's brother-in-law) before she finally shuffled onto the stage

- A sequence of outtakes that showed Marilyn repeatedly flubbing her lines in scenes with Dean Martin in ""Something's Got to Give""

Total run time is 91 minutes (I was hoping for more).  Also, there's a bonus feature of 20 theatrical trailers; watching them all takes 55 minutes, but they're great.  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone.",1114905600,37,1994,5.253164556962025
