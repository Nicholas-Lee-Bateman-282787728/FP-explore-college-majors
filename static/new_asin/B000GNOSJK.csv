8133698,5,B000GNOSJK,"I found this film to be very funny and poignant, exploring male-female relationships, family interaction and cultural clashes - all from a Jewish point-of-view, of course.  At times it reminded me of Woody Allen's work (think ""Annie Hall"" in Tel Aviv) - just the right blend of clever scripting, visual humor and familial angst.  Highly recommended!",1321401600,,349,5.214285714285714
8133699,4,B000GNOSJK,"This light-hearted comedy from Israel gives us a three young men trying to come to terms with adulthood.
The movie begins at the wedding of Omer, who like many young Israelis is obsessed by his army service and would like to run his entire life with military discipline. His realization that this won't work in his marriage leads to a monumental meltdown.
Uri is also struggling with commitment issues and is tugged between his lovely girlfriend Tali and his very traditional, domineering and totally unreasonable North African father.
Zidane, who follows strange Far Eastern religions, longs for love with a Colombian girl he once exchanged longing glances with, but his true soulmate may be closer to home.
The movie doesn't go very deep, being mostly concerned with generating laughs, but it does have an interesting take on the cultural and religious splits in modern Israeli society.
It's interesting how many contemporary movies, both in the United States and elsewhere, concern themselves with the reluctance of young men to grow up. This Israeli take on the subject, for all that its plot is ramshackle and unbelievable, tackles the issue with a light hand and considerable wit.",1250208000,2,1186,5.087179487179487
