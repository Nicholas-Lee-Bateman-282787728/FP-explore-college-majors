Even though I could only get this on VHS, I was happy to recieve it. I had been taping the series when it was on. But one of my kids taped over it! I so upset! This VHS is only of the first show and doesn't have any of the other shows that were aired. I would love obtain them if they ever become avaiable! It was a good series, I don't know why it was cancelled! I loved the 2 main characters and have seen them on other shows but I liked them in their role on this show!",1378166400,2,589,3.7580645161290325

So far no luck.
Every nonsense gets a DVD release, why not such a suspenseful TV series?",1372291200,2,172,4.088235294117647
