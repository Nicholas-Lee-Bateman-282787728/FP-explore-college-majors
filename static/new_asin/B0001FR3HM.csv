1995705,3,B0001FR3HM,"This Remake, like most remakes, did not live up to its original. The original movie, Can't Buy Me Love was much better filmwise and the acting was better than Love Don't Cost a Thing. In trying to update the movie they took away some details that would have made the movie flow more easily and connect scene to scene. If you really want to see a movie with better acting, better directing and better storyline that even includes a message that is sent to the audience in a very interesting way the skip this flick and rent the first one!",1075420800,,537,4.38
1995706,3,B0001FR3HM,"This film gets a mixed review at best from me. I check out films like this with my goddaughter who is 11. I loved Drumline and thought Cannon was pretty good in it. I believe he does some cable stuff on TV and I thought that I would be okay taking an 11 year old to this movie.
The film has a good message and predictably marches along its path. Nick Cannon's transformation is kind of abrupt. From Poolboy to trendsetter the events that transformed him seemed kind of abrupt. The big deal for me was there was an ongoing condom theme in the flick that caught me off guard. I don't think it was in the promos and I felt somewhat misled. I would not advise any parents to let their young kids watch this movie unless kids understand what condoms are and I wouldn't watch this with your kids unless you are prepared to have that discussion.
I have mixed feelings about that being a major joke in a PG-13 movie. On the one hand, I think adult themes should go under the radar and not be easily understood by kids or have questionable language. On the other hand there are far too many PG-13 movies that have borderline explicit sexuality without addressing safe sex. I don't know whether I should be thankful to this movie for catalyzing that discussion or angry at it for sneaking it under the radar.
Outside of that, I was mildly entertained in a predictable flick. The themes were positive and there are good messages about friendship and the dangers of popularity for teenagers.
I believe there are better urban flicks out there for the 9-13 age bracket and I'll be on the lookout for them. This probably a good flick for teenagers in high school.

1995708,5,B0001FR3HM,"This is based on the screenplay, Can't Buy Me Love, from 1987. Almost 17 years later, set in 2003 the story holds up and this film is true to the messages on loyalty, friendship and the price of popularity. This movie is funny, charming, and sweet without being corny.
Nick Cannon is great as the lead character: An outsider/nerd looking to belong to the in crowd. He is a natural actor and is sure to have a great career in the future.
Christina Milian as the female lead is more than just a pretty face, she brings a surprising depth to her character. She shows us an introspective and vulnerable person underneath her popular cheerleader exterior. It is her sweet side that will make Christina a major star.
It is very satisfying and funny. Both the original and the remake have a lot of appeal and are worth seeing.",1071273600,9,819,4.503355704697986

1995714,3,B0001FR3HM,"2004 saw the release of this updated version of 1987's Can't Buy Me Love, a teen comedy about a guy who just wants to be accepted and liked.  It's funny when comparing these movies that so many things change, but just as many stay the same.

Following the plot of the original in 1987, a smart but socially awkward teenager named Alvin longs to be popular and accepted by the popular clique.  He has been mooning over Paris, one of the gorgeous beautiful people whose swimming pool he has been cleaning for years.  One day, when Paris is in a fix after getting into a fender bender with her mom's SUV, Alvin makes her an offer she can't refuse.  He offers her a large wad of cash to repair the car if she will pretend to be his girlfriend for two weeks.  He is sure that just her being with him will make him popular, and she agrees.  Sure enough, when they show up on Monday morning to walk down the popular kids' hallway, he is met with obvious confusion and hostility.  Thanks to Paris's presence and intervention, soon the other popular kids accept him.  After they stage their break up, Alvin's street cred is intact and he becomes popular like he always wanted.  Unfortunately for him, he becomes vain and proud, drunk with power, and when the truth is revealed, he is left all alone.

This movie speaks to so many things within us, but quite honestly the 1987 version did it better.  This one was updated with hip hop music and diversity because that's what so many are about now.  However, these changes are only surface things.  The things that others will and will not see are that we always want to accepted and popular.  Power corrupts, as it does with Ronald in 1987 and Alvin in 2004.  Alvin went from Eurkle to Kanye West in about twenty minutes, and the example of the dancing at the beach party was not as innovative as the one at the school dance in 1987.  People are followers, and if you are in the right position to do so, you can make them follow you for your innovation.  People will also do anything for money, anything for power, and anything to be liked.  This movie shows you so.  It also shows you how shallow people really are and who the true friends are and are not.  Sad but true.  And it's just as sad but true as an adult.  Unfortunately we have to learn this, that high school never ends.",1456012800,,2323,4.363636363636363

1995757,4,B0001FR3HM,"Love don't cost a thing is a great hillarious comedy. It's about some kid named Alvin Johnson, who struggles to find social acceptance amongst his peer groups. He then meets a strikingly beautiful woman, Paris Morgan, his schoolmate, the envy of all her female schholmates due to her sex appeal. After Paris wrecks her mother's expensive car, Alvin leverages this opportunity & offers to assist her financially to repair the car. But only on one condition, that she pretends to be his girlfriend for a month, though Paris persistently settles for a month.

And after the deal is prosperously struck, Alvin starts garnering recognition amongst his schoolmates but it's easier said than done, as unexpected challenges come to the fore. To aggravate matters, Alvin doesn't even realise it when Paris falls for him. But his father, portrayed brilliantly by comedian Steve Harvey, appreciates his son's newly found playboy image, while his sister & mother think he's hallucinating.

This comedy will have you laughing till you drop. 7/10 is my personal rating of the movie & I recommend it to everyone.

Thank you Amazon for your shipment. I will forever remain indebted to thank you.

1995759,3,B0001FR3HM,"You now the scenario; boy meets girl, girl is out of boys league BUT boy has something that girl wants so she takes what she wants and gives him what he wants only to find out that he USED to be everything she ever wanted.  This same concept has been used and abused for years.  In fact, this very film is a remake.  That said; this movie has some serious charm, which really works to its benefit.  Not that I'm a huge fan of Mr. Mariah Carey, but he has some nice comedic timing, and his faux swag (I say faux only because he is far more believable as a nerd) is entertaining.  Christina Milian is a cutey, and she really comes through as the popular girl lost in a sea of popularity she kind of resents.  The message presented, about being yourself and not formulating to the molds of teenage society, is a nice one (albeit an overused and underdeveloped one), and the bouncy infectious teenage quality to the film is nothing short of enjoyable.  I kind of loathe Steve Harvey, so his mug gracing the screen was a turn-off, and his ridiculous attempt at emulating Eugene Levy's iconic `American Pie' father role was a total misfire; but you have to expect a film like this to have its downs to balance out the ups.  There is absolutely NOTHING new here but overall it's a fun film and if you are looking for this breed of rom-com you could do far worse.",1284508800,2,1355,4.32806324110672

1995763,4,B0001FR3HM,"I was set against watching this movie for it looked generic and stupid, but it was a lazy day Saturday and it was on TV so I gave it a shot and much to my enjoyment it wasn't half bad.  I've always felt Nick Cannon was funny, but it was Christina Milian who really impressed me.  She's a very talented young girl, with her acting as well as her singing, and she brings the best of both here in this film.  I will say though that I am not a fan of Steve Harvey and I don't really think he'll ever do something I enjoy...his character to me was nothing special and would have preferred he be played by anyone else, but alas, he didn't take away anything from the film so he was tolerable.

The film itself is a remake of the '87 comedy `Can't Buy Me Love', which I've never seen but probably will rent just for kicks.  It's a story about Alvin (Cannon) who's the super smart nerd in school who wishes that just once he could experience popularity.  When Paris (Milian), one of the most popular girls in school, damages her mother's car and needs help in a hurry Alvin is there is offer his assistance in exchange for a chance to be cool.  Paris agrees to fake a two-week relationship with Alvin in order to get him in with her crowd and then they'll split up publicly and continue with their newfound lives.

Over the course of the film the predictable plot thickens, for we all know that Alvin and Paris will fall in love and end up together, but how this happens of course will have it's twists and turns and they will try and make us believe they won't get together but we all know how it will end.  That said, it's still a fun ride, with great chemistry between the two leads, Cannon showing great comedic range and Milian giving us warmth in what could have been a very generic role.  Bottom line is, while it's nothing new, it's still a fun way to spend an afternoon.",1156723200,,1871,4.245070422535211

1995766,1,B0001FR3HM,"These days, the name of the game in making movies is to either milk the jokes, to give the people what they want and only what the small amount wants or just handing them a mirror (art imitating life imitating art), and to follow the same rules your mom gave you about your food as a child: you can't get the goods until you finish what is in front of you. That is what Holly Would Not is doing for us: the very last one. Not only are they handing us a pointless remake, but they are doing an Afro-American Version that kind of makes it a lot worse than the original.

  There will always be the geek who never gets the girl in a high school because, well, he is a geek and she is a self-proclaimed ""beauty"". (Stuff like that is the reason I never wanted to go to High School in the first place.) You can see that anywhere and it is further nauseating to see that a geek is acting as obnoxious as the ""beauty"" as days roll by. (Notice that the geek doesn't look half bad. All he has is an nfro and a unibrow. The beauty wears a lipgloss and clothes from a magazine and music videos.)

  This movie is not trying to push the fact that it is cool to be obnoxious and rude to people who just want friends and just want you to know their name, but that is exactly what it seems like.

  Pretend you were a child right now. The movie is full of undercooked broocoli and chitlins served night after night (scene after scene). Be careful if you do watch this movie. Chances are you will get a negative believe that black people are the biggest animals, Even out of BET.

I think you would be hard-pressed to find any ""unpopular"" (whatever that is) teenage male in high school who would be willing to pay a girl $1500 to pretend to be his girlfriend for two weeks so he could be popular. That is plain ignorant.

The story was unbelievable, the acting was below par. I didn't see any redeeming values of this movie. All it does is once again portray young teenage blacks as vain, shallow, overly sexed hedonists. Even I can appreciate a movie where the dialect is ""from the streets"", but even the so-called hip-hop dialect used in this movie is grossly over-exaggerated.

This was a horrible movie and not worth the time it takes to watch it.",1101686400,,897,4.4573170731707314
1995785,5,B0001FR3HM,"I was bored one night and I wanted to tune into something just to kick back. I found out this movie was on Cinemax OnDemand so I watched it. As I'm watching it, I'm thinking this movie isn't too bad. Then the following day, my opinion changed on this movie. The movie went from a not too bad movie to watch occasionally to a must have movie. The movie is great because of the chemistry between Nick Cannon and Christina Milian. Cannon plays Alvin, a really smart guy with two part-time jobs but is a social outcast. Milian plays Paris, the most popular girl in school and the girl that every guy in high school dreams of dating. Alvin is one of those guys and when Paris takes her mother's Escalade in for repair, Alvin buys the parts to fix it and they make a deal that they have to pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend. She turns him into a cool person and everybody likes him. But his ego gets in the way of his future and his original friends lose respect for him, his family is concerned about him, and Paris comes to like the old Alvin instead of the new Alvin. I really like this movie. Alvin is awesome because he's someone we can relate to and Paris is sweet and hot. This movie is a combination of two movies I hate. Those movies are Class Act and Can't Hardly Wait. I hate each movie for a different reason. I hate Class Act because it's off-key and I hate Can't Hardly Wait because JLH is in it. But this movie has a better script and everybody plays their part well here. Kenan Thompson does a great job as one of Alvin's friends and Steve Harvey is hilarious as Alvin's dad. This movie further exposes how biast movie critics are and how political The Oscars are. This movie has great laughs, great characters, great chemistry, and a great ending and all that equals a great movie!",1100995200,3,1797,4.319526627218935
1995786,1,B0001FR3HM,"You know Hollywood?s hard up for material when it starts blowing the dust off movies from as recent as the 1980?s to rehash and remake (films that weren?t any good to begin with, I might add).  ?Love Don?t Cost a Thing? is a pointless update of ?Can?t Buy Me Love,? the tale of a high school nerd who hires the hottest babe on campus to pretend to be his girlfriend.  His hope is that, through his association with her, he will gain entree into the ?cool? crowd at school.

The stereotypes of adolescents that the film presents weren?t fresh twenty years ago and they?re even less so today.  The story is utterly hackneyed and predictable what with Alvin being first an object of scorn, then - after some utterly unconvincing ghetto-?Pygmalion? makeover scenes - finding acceptance in the upper echelon of with-it kids, while at the same time turning his back on and rejecting the fellow nerds who used to be his friends.  True to the formula, Alvin eventually learns a lesson or two about what being true to oneself really means.

There are virtually no funny moments in the film and the scenes between Alvin and his sex-obsessed dad begin to border on the creepy.  ?Love Don?t Cost a Thing? may seem clever and fresh to audiences not old enough to have seen many movies, let alone the original on which this film is based.  The rest of us with somewhat longer memories will gladly take a pass.  What next?  A remake of ?Howard the Duck??",1090454400,3,1439,4.56420233463035
1995787,2,B0001FR3HM,"Love may not cost a thing, but this movie does and its not worth it.  The male character goes from erkel to puff doody overnight and is never likeable.  Why the hot chick goes for him after all the stupid stuff he pulls is beyond comprehension.  Stereotypes abound in this movie and none of them add anything to the humorless wreck.  At the end I felt sorry for the nice selfless cheerleader (one non-stereotype anyway) who ends up with the goofy jerk in the end.",1088553600,4,463,4.411764705882353

1995789,2,B0001FR3HM,"Love Don't Cost A Thing is a pointless retreat of 1989's Can't Buy Me Love, a far superior, much more entertaining comedy. At first, the idea of a remake bothered me. Then, I saw the trailer and thought it could be a good urban twist on the familiar story, and I decided to give it a chance. Good casting saves the lackluster script, which really brings nothing new to the story, journeying into familiar territory where we have gotten lost countless times before. Christina Millian, Nick Cannon, and Steve Harvey are all terrific, but the film is slow moving and often boring. A rushed ending does nothing to help it and tops the pizza with an unneeded extra slice of cheese. This could be fun for anyone who hasn't seen the original, but take my advice and rent that one instead. I only recommend this to die-hard Christina, Nick, or Steve fans. Others are better spending the evening with Patrick Demsey.",1086566400,,907,4.6397515527950315

I don't know any remakes that are as good as the original, but this one was bad.  I only went to see it b/c I was outnumbered by my friends (I'm mad about my $6).  Anyways, the 80s version is multiple times better.
I'm so glad that the original is on Oxygen's favorite movie list.",1085011200,,443,4.226190476190476
1995793,4,B0001FR3HM,"This was a good movie, and clean.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it had a good message and the unfolding of the story was well done.  Real situations and good for the family to watch.  Enjoyable!!",1084924800,,194,4.333333333333333
1995794,4,B0001FR3HM,"This movie started out slow, but it managed to pull it all together in the end.

This is another high school flick making an attempt at uncovering the uselessness of trying to be someone you're not.  Alvin Johnson has never quite fit in; he has a nerd-crew he hangs with, but it is his dream to get close the elitist of the elite, Paris Morgan (played by Christina Milian).  When Paris wrecks her Mom's car, the mechanically inclined Alvin takes advantage of the situation, offering to fix Paris's car and pay for the parts.  The only catch, Paris has to hang with Alvin for two weeks.  Well, he wanted a month, but they settled for the two weeks.  After all, he is kind of a geek!
Alvin and Paris end up becoming friends and she tries to change his image, and this is where the movie gets really good.  Christina Milian is an excellent actress; she manages to make the scenes in this predictable sequence (her finding him clothes and a new hairstyle) work really well.  She doesn't over act at all, and this makes the movie a breath of fresh air.
There is a great scene in this film, one that should become a classic:  Alvin and Paris are talking to each other (really listening too) and Alvin mentions that he almost had a college scholarship because of his mechanical abilities, but he wasn't able to get the final part for their automobile engine.  When Paris presses him for more information, she learns that he used all of his money (that  was supposed to be for the part) to fix her car, she truly begins to care for him, seeing the side of him she has ignored.
As I have said, this movie starts out slow but finishes strong.  I liked it a lot.  Christina Milian is one of the most beautiful girls on the screen right now.  She is also a great actress (LOL, you're not going to believe this - I had never even heard of her before this movie!...told ya you wouldn't believe it).
Now, is this movie for younger kids?  Nope, not unless you want your kids to see a Dad explaining to his teenage son how to put a condom on and score with the ladies.  Sixteen and up, only, in my opinion.
Enjoy the show.
See ya next review.

I just have to say that when it comes to the facts of a remake this one is way low on my scale. I mean the guy pays the girl 1500 hundred dollars plus labor for two weeks of being popular. In the other film it was only a thousand dollars, and a month's worth of being popular. The only parts I liked was that it was funny, but it definitely was not a true remake.

But also this movie teaches u that u aint got to change just to be ""ONE OF THE ELIETS"" or meaning on of the kool people. This is just a wonderfull movie tO watch.",1082764800,,530,3.871559633027523
1995798,4,B0001FR3HM,The story has lots to laugh out loud about. I find it very entertaining.,1081296000,,72,4.214285714285714
1995799,4,B0001FR3HM,"""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is a remake of an 80's movie ""Can't Buy Me Love."" The thing that saved this movie was Steve Harvey. He was probally in this movie for about twenty, twenty five minutes, and he stole every scene that he was in. It was also kind of sweet and you feel bad for the main character Alvin, played by Nick Cannon. Cannon was in the hit ""Drumline"" last year, which I missed, but I'm sure he did fine in that movie, because he did well in this. The story of this movie is the same as ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and unlike that movie, this one works. Cannon is joined by Christina Millian, who probally could have been replaced by somebody a little less cute, because she wasn't that right for the role.
""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is about Alvin Johnson, a nerdy kid that is usually invisable to the other students at his high school. He works in a local auto shop, where he is quite good at what he does. When he's not hanging out with his friends Walter, Chuck, and Ken, he is working on making a car for a science competition. He also gets embarrassing sexual advice from his father Clarence, played by Steve Harvey. Steve Harvey has a comedic talents where you can't help grinning because he is grinning, and you know that something funny is going to come out of his mouth. He has a crush on a girl, Paris, but so does everybody else in the school. His luck changes when Paris wrecks her mother's car. Her mother is away for the weekend, but Paris needs it fixed before she gets home. Alvin makes a deal with her. He could fix the car before her mother comes home, and she will pretend to be dating him so that he could become popular. She agrees. The next Monday at school they pretend to be dating, to the shock of the school, including her crowd of friends. With advice from her, he begins to change his image. From nerdy Alvin, to cool Alvin, much to the dismay of his friends who begin to not like him because she is not being himself. Alvin and Paris begin to fall for each other, and that makes Alvin question weather he should go back to his normal self, or continue with the image that everybody else thinks is cool.
The chemistry between Alvin and Paris is well done. You could feel for these characters and throughout the movie you are always hoping for them to get together with each other, even though they might not, because she already has a boyfriend. It was a good movie, but its problem is that it has scenes that are useless. Useless scenes ruin many movies, and ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is one of them. Worth an afternoon theatre ticket, but for an evening show you should see something else.
ENJOY!
Rated PG-13 for sexual content/humor.",1075507200,,2670,4.342
