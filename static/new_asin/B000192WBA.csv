8008321,5,B000192WBA,"David Lynch is not for everyone, but this short series is one of the most creative examples of TV sitcom I have seen. It's a good example of postmodern television aesthetic. Blinky, a television technician who sees the world from the perspective of a person with Bozeman Symplex, is especially engaging, as are the Hurry-Up Twins.",1394755200,2,330,4.910714285714286
8008322,5,B000192WBA,"David Lynch's second TV project after his phenomenal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks-The-First-Season-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks - The First Season (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;is one I really enjoy. Within the eight episodes presented here (all that was produced and only three of which,including the pilot aired on TV in my area) revolve around a television network called ZBC's (stands for Zyblocknic Broadcasting Company)attempt to put on 'The Lester Guy' show and the utterly surreal slapstick that occurs. A few people I know who saw this show,set in New York in 1957,thought that it was weird for weird's sake but....here's my take on it.'On The Air' had some of the potentially (and sadly unrealized) TV characters to come along since I Love Lucy or even something as recent as Seinfeld. First there is the character of Lester Guy,played by Ian Buchannan (who I always thought looked somewhat like a very charicatured version of The Manhattan Tranfer's Alan Paul)-Lester is the walking embodiment of the washed up movie star/Hollywood showbiz phony stereotype and,in this series it's ""his"" show (or rather presense in it) that always ends up in a source of embarrassment for him. Although in the weirdest episode of this I've seen Lester abruptly shows an allience to beatnicks and avante garde culture (a typically odd Lynch twist).The mastermind of all this is Buddy Budwaller,played by the always distinctive Miguel Farrar who reacts to everything far more harshly then he should. His assistant,who has a twisted crush on Lester Guy is the completely demented Nicole Thorn. David ""Squiqy"" Lander portrays......the directer whose name (and much of his dialog) I cannot pronounce-all of his gags come from the fact that he has no grasp of the english language and Ruth,the only sane rational one in the group and (unsuccessfully)the always helpful but frightfully anxiety prone Dwight McGarnical try to translate his words into plain english. There is also another ""Thorn"" in Lester's side when (as seen in the pilot) his co star Betty Hudson unwittingly steals the show. Now Betty is a young blonde,sweet and kind as they come but is completely mindless and oblivious to the world around her. Some of the characters are mainly sight gags such as The Hurry Up Twins,characters who only appear in one cameo per episode but are apparently so important it is ALWAYS verbally announced when they appear on screen. Another bigger part is engineer Blinky,who suffers from a disease where everything is repeated again and again in his eyes,surrounded by a series of bizzare hallucinations. Another character who sadly got to appear twice is the utterly extraterrestrial looking (that includes his toupe) Mr. Zybloknic himself,who turns out to share his director cousin's shoe fetish. Some of my favorite episodes include the great pilot,an episode where Betty's Joan Crawford-like sister visits and tries to upstage the show from her,a gypsy magician whose bag of tricks include being able to transform himself into a vagrant until he witnessess the ""dog of transformation"" (we never find out whether or not he WAS really a vagrant or not) and the final episode where,at Lester's insistance a group of Beatnicks guest on the show with subplots surrounding fetishs and voice disintegraters (including a whispered mention of the word ""reefer"" which I am sure prompted some areas not to show this episode). My father worked in local television as an engineer for nearly 20 years and was still while this show came on. And while this depicts big city TV fiascos I know the TV station my father worked at would probably also be able to spawn an 'On The Air' series of it's own.",1188000000,3,3767,5.290484140233723
8008323,5,B000192WBA,"ABC TV ordered seven episodes of this Lynch series as TWIN PEAKS was near it's final days. I saw the first broadcast (in 1992?), which I believe was the only episode to air in the States. The remaining episodes eventually aired in Europe. Lynch and Mark Frost created a fictional TV network (Zoblotnic Broadcasting Co.) set in 1957, and their main staple was ""The Lester Guy Show"". Lester Guy was played by Ian Buchannon, and Miguel Ferrer played the network boss Bud Budwaller. Tracey Walter and David Lander are also regulars. Chuck McCann and Freddie Jones appeared on two seperate episodes. Everything that could possibly go wrong during a live TV broadcast in 1957 seems to happen to Lester Guy. But in spite of all the problems that occur, ZBC discovers they have a hit show on their hands. Thanks in large part to co-star Betty Hudson, who is a sweet but brainless woman. She saves the first show, and immediately moves Lester to second bananna status. All seven episodes are collected on one VHS tape, which has a 1993 issue date on it. Running time approx. 168 minutes. If you love David Lynch, you have to check this show out.",1171065600,7,1136,4.656716417910448
