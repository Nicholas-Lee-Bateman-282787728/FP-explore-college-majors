3875417,1,B0028YW37E,This film is a complete ripoff of DECENT. Not a good rip-off either. It contains some of the worst dialogue ever put on film. Kind of scary that films like this continue to get released to the viewing public.  zero stars if there was an option.,1281139200,,244,4.304347826086956
3875418,4,B0028YW37E,"Having just suffered through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reborn/dp/B002NPY7G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reborn</a>, I don't know what possessed me to turn around and watch another Craig McMahon movie - but I'm glad I did because The Crypt is a deliciously creepy little film.  Unlike the utter nonsense of Reborn, The Crypt has a decent storyline, atmosphere, suspense, and even subtlety.  It's hard for me to believe the same man wrote and directed both of these films.  I was actually talking back to the screen during this film's final ten minutes of action.  I wouldn't say the ending is unconventional, but I certainly didn't expect things to play out the way they did.  Clearly, Craig McMahon has some talent and potential, after all.

It was supposed to be an easy job.  There are a bunch of rich, Depression-era dead people buried in a maze of crypts underneath the city, just waiting for some enterprising young criminals to come down and relieve them of their riches (the dead folks apparently thought the government was going to try and take their treasures, so they took them to the grave with them).  Of course, we all know from the film's opening scene that grave robbing can be a dangerous pastime down in the Crypt - but the modern-day characters in the story don't know that.  Still, when Gina (Abra May) first broaches the subject with her friends, none of them are enthusiastic to say the least - but the lure of those buried riches soon changes their way of thinking.  Soon after the six criminals make their way into the crypt, it starts to become clear that something is very wrong down there.  At first, it manifests as shadows in individuals' peripheral vision, but as soon as they rake in their first haul the whole edifice seems to rock and shift, blocking the way out in the process.  The six soon become separated into three groups, and that is when the underground monsters come out to play - and to punish those would dare steal from the very coffins of the dead.

The lovely Sarah Oh shines in this film as the most reluctant member of the group, but I thought the acting was pretty good all the way around.  The special effects are also well-done, making the inhabitants of the crypt genuinely creepy in appearance.  I also thought the pacing of the film was quite good, which necessarily contributes to the overall creepiness of the whole experience.  If you're as claustrophobic as I am, all of the time spent in the crypts is even more unsettling.  It is not nearly as intense as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent-Original-Unrated-Cut-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent (Original Unrated Cut) [Widescreen Edition</a>](a film which might well have inspired The Crypt), but it's there - and you can feel it.

Given the way the film ends, it's clear that Craig McMahon put some real thought into the story - with the exception of one scene early on.  It's a great scene, actually, but it really has no purpose in the context of the overall story and is quickly brushed aside.  That is obviously a problem, but it did little to temper my enjoyment of The Crypt.  I didn't think Craig McMahon had it in him, but this is a darn good horror film.",1279065600,9,3312,5.0626151012891345

I'm glad I did with this one because it kept my attention throughout the whole flick.  The story is very entertaining and I LOVE what the creator(s) have done with the ghostly zombie concept!  Those glowing eyes are crazy!  I think this is the first flick I've ever seen ghosts depicted like that.  Not loaded with gore but it didn't need that.  Most horrors these days tend to go that route.  There are some scenes in this flick that did manage to spook me slightly haha.  So for that, being that its a low-budget  zombie-like ghost flick, it deserves a five star rating in my opinion.  My favorite part would have to be the 'car scene'!

3875426,2,B0028YW37E,"Oh, boy.

So first, spoilers abound. Second, this movie reminded me of Shutter Island in that the only thing that was good about it was the setting. In fact, this movie probably would have worked a lot better if, instead of using terrible CG monsters that are more funny than scary, they had simply made this a human vs. environment story. The best (meaning most horrific, stomach churning) death in the film has nothing to do with the monsters, and between the earthquakes and collapsing tunnels and corpse-infused flood water, there's more than enough environmental hazards to kill off 4 moronic, absolutely useless characters and 2 believably capable ones.

But in terms of what doesn't work about this movie from a craft standpoint, where do I even begin?

The first, most noticeable problem is that the editing is incoherent. After the extended opening sequence, the viewer is treated to a barrage of ""scenes"" in which a man is picked up from prison by his girlfriend, three girls steal a car and get one girls' little brother killed in the process, and then all of those characters, whom we know nothing about other than what we've seen in these two ""scenes,"" meet up with another character about whom we know nothing and have a conversation about robbing a crypt. Because each ""scene"" just jump-cuts, with no establishing shots or contextual explanation of how it fits in the movie, there's no way of telling how we're supposed to interpret these scenes within the chronology of the story. Did they all happen at the same time? Was the one with the 3 girls stealing a car a flashback? Or did they all go to meet with the crypt lady immediately after, with the kid's corpse still in the car, covered by a windshield shade? I mean, what is going on here??

That brings us to the characters. It would be kind to call these characters flat or 1 dimensional. To me, they seem totally unreadable because they're completely inconsistent and none of their motivations are the least bit clear. For instance, immediately following the scene in which they first discuss robbing the crypt, a conversation in which they unanimously decided that it's a horrible idea and that they aren't going to do it because they don't trust the person setting up the heist, we get a series of scenes in which one character says he doesn't like his job and another does a Google search, and suddenly all six characters are robbing the crypt. What?? Then there are characters who are there who CLEARLY do not want to be there, like the girl who's only role in the film, aside from getting her head crushed, is to complain about, among other things, not getting cellphone service in the underground crypt. I guess the other thing she does is ask the girl who's brother got shot in the head...at some point an indeterminate amount of time before the heist...if she's OK, like 9 times.

Furthermore, the movie absolutely can NOT settle on a protagonist. At first, because of the way his first scene is shot, it seems like it'll be Perry. But the movie is a free-for-all perspective-wise. There are at least 4 different characters who seem at different points like the protagonist of this movie, because everything about the way the scenes are being filmed seems designed to make you think that they're the protagonist.

Part of the problem is that no one is given an arc here: stuff just happens. They choose not to do a thing, then they choose to do it, then while they're doing the thing, an earthquake happens, the thing they're doing floods, and then there's also this kind of other story about corpses murdering thieves for revenge. At first, it seems like it'll be about the competition of the two female leads over, for god knows what reason, Perry, but that storyline fizzles out when it simply never gets brought up again and Perry gets choked to death. Then it seems like it could be Paige getting revenge on the leader character (I can't remember her name), but that doesn't happen either. And of course, because there's a leader character, you'd think she'd have an arc - nope. She is the definition of a static character and she makes maybe the most obvious horror movie mistake I've ever seen a character make.

I guess one character does make it out alive, but surviving a bunch of happenstance isn't exactly a story arc. Oh, also, see if you can guess which character lives. It's like, insanely easy to figure it out. You can do it without ever even playing the movie.

Look, everything is bad here. The writing is ridiculous. The characters routinely say stuff that just isn't relevant or doesn't make any sense instead of just speaking to one another like humans would, and the actors read the lines as if they've never met other human beings before. The monsters, once they're shown for anything longer than 2 seconds, are mercilessly cheesy. There's literally a scene where one stands feet away from another character with his hands up in the ""I'm gonna getcha!"" position for like a solid 5 minutes of screen time. Even the camera work is wack. There are times where you can that two different cameras are being used to switch between shots during conversations between two characters because they look AND sound totally different.

The Crypt is a masterclass in what not to do when making a movie, and it's worth watching for that reason alone. This is such a good example of what not to do that I seriously feel like I learned about filmmaking watching this movie.",1489190400,2,5461,4.703974895397489

But the ""performances"" by the cast made the movie unbearable and I just could not finish it.
Amateur actors don't necessarily ruin a movie-- many people have natural charisma onscreen that makes up for their lack of acting experience.
Unfortunately, that's not the case here.

3875441,1,B0028YW37E,"I'm going to start by saying this movie is garbage. I'll go on about why down below, but if you're just quickly looking to see whether you should watch a movie or not, I tell you now to run and never look back.

The Crypt is a movie that takes any kind of promise from its setting and plot and destroys it right at the beginning. After a somewhat interesting intro, we're fast-forwarded to the ""present day"" where we meet out band of unfortunate victims. I'm not going to lie, I don't think any of the characters were hired for their acting skill. From the moment the gang all gets together to hear about their big score, it's stilted dialogue and awkward characterization all around! I'm not even sure we learned all the characters names at any point during the movie. To top that off, their reactions to various things tend to just be something along the lines of ""stare at it dumbly and move on"". Even when one of the characters is stuck in a room, with a broken ankle, and sees a ghost, she doesn't scream, doesn't freak out. She just calmly mentions that she's not alone in the room. Yes, that actually happened.

There's also a huge problem with scene transitions in this movie, in that they're pretty much non-existent. The film will jump randomly from one point to the other, with little to no explanation of how or why characters are where they are or what they're doing. There are also a couple of times where the screen just goes black, long enough that I actually wondered if my tv had turned off somehow.

The story itself starts off promising, if a bit cliched, but quickly turns into a series of decisions that cannot be explained made further aggravating by the cast's lack of emotion/reaction to 90% of what's going on around them. The absolute worst part is the last 10-20 minutes of the film, where the characters actually go back to the crypt for no pay off whatsoever.

The final frustrating aspect of this movie is the special effects, which goes from well done when it comes to the gore/blood scenes, to outright terrible when it comes to the ghosts, who look like they picked up their costumes at the local Halloween store with some gray grease paint.

All in all The Crypt is a horror movie that you just can't buy into. Worst of all, it's not a bad movie that knows it's bad and runs with it. The Crypt is a bad movie that actually takes itself seriously, and that's all the more pity.

Save yourself the time and brain cells, find a different movie.

They just hired the wrong people for the job and the people obviously do stupid things for idiotic reasons that you wouldn't do in real life.  This story needed some tweaking and it could've been great.  It had great potential.  The characters are obviously super stupid just by the first scene.  Then we have a time jump that doesn't really explain itself.  The characters flip-flop so much!  They have a really idiotic motivation to go into ""The Crypt"" in the first place as well.  Have these people heard of real jobs?!  One person mentions his job, but it seems the others say nothing about going to get a job.  This movie is heavily reliant on jump scares for ""horror"".  The one person I felt some sympathy for just basically disappears.  The one chick who wanted them to go there in the first place acts like she isn't scared at all and it kind of explains it, but it's a stupid explanation.  The sound quality is also terrible and the captions were going ahead when I watched it.  Also, who gets out of that situation and doesn't call the police?  They don't try things to help themselves and they don't even call for their friends most of the time.  Hewie from Haunting Grounds (video game) is more responsive than these people.  The one that turned out to be the ""main"" character was not who I would've picked by the way she acted and her idiocy.  The ""ghosts"" have nice make up though :/",1481500800,6,1571,4.373702422145329

3875503,2,B0028YW37E,"I got sick of other reviews saying this movie has a good story. It had a glaring critical loophole. We all know the kind. That one loophole that throws the whole movie into question. The type of loophole you can't ignore. Where the movie has started showing off the ""rules"" by which it will work; then immediately reverses those rules.

 For example, they start the movie by showing the crypt sealing itself up with an attempted grave robber inside. This would be our first ""rule:"" removing items from the crypt will result in death. Then our story picks up with Plot Device Girl A suddenly having the ring that the grave robber was stealing. Towards the end of the movie, Plot Device Girl A admits to going into the crypt before. If that is the case why didn't the ghosts kill her for trying to take the same ring as the last grave robber? I know they didn't let her go just to draw in other grave robbers. At no point do they bother explaining how she got the ring, or more importantly, how the ring made it out of the crypt that sealed itself.

Almost 10 minutes into their expedition into the crypt and our band of grave robbers suddenly realize they have to open tombs to get the goods. Was that not an established point when they agreed to rob a Prohibition-Era crypt?
Most discoveries or plot advances are made through luck (dropping things.)
Girl will a broken ankle suddenly develops a complication that makes her cough up blood (only for a quick moment in a scene that no one notices so don't worry, she dies moments later from unrelated issues).
Girl with an open compound ankle fracture can put weight on it in some scenes but not others.
Lack of funds (I assume) leads to only three on-camera deaths.
Two people are ""squeeze the skull"" kills.
One is a neat contortion artist kill.
One person is dragged off screen with no death confirmation.
Plot Device Girl A dies deep-throating an arm.
Despite being grabbed repeatedly while in the water, girl continues to place herself in positions to be ripped from ledges instead of climbing in.
Only after being ripped off a ledge does character finally show restraint (yay! character development)
Despite crawling. rolling around, and swimming, girl still has a loose fitting bracelet on her wrist
The side story of this weird romance circle between the women and one man felt very forced.

Characters realize that jewelry is basically cursed and ditch it to escape. This makes the ghosts back off. Only we learn later that Plot Device Girl A had a hidden bracelet in her bra the whole time. So why did the ghosts let them leave? Why bother sealing the crypt if you can just kill everyone that takes a piece anyway. These are the most inconsistent cursed items I have seen so far.
If she was going back to retrieve her love interest (who she didn't seem to care that much about) why did she need an empty backpack? Or better yet, why wear booty shorts with a warm jacket when you plan on swimming in underground crypt water? On top of that, why go back at all? It is already the next day.
Despite shaking his head to indicate ""no"" to the question of if there is more jewelry, girl drags guy out of tomb. At this point she understands how the curse works, she acknowledged his head motion. She willingly got him murdered by ghosts.
Film will then attempt to save itself using Lara Croft outfits, a gratuitous amount of eye candy shots and jump scars that to me felt very off (awkward sound effects / cut to and back from the jump scare / telegraphed).

To be fair, this was made by a small crew of people (less than 5, I think) so costume design, props, effects and such are not things I was too worried about. (Like one character pulling the antenna out of her cell phone for better reception or pristine jewelry being in a tomb or the switch back and forth between Prohibition-Era and Modern-Era jewelry)

Movie gives an amazing example of how not to perform a splint. Anyone caring to know, you do not ever, and I do mean EVER, tighten a belt down directly over the break. That is a great way to produce some extra internal bleeding or possibly knock the two fragments out of alignment (if they weren't already.) You also shouldn't poke the bone sticking out but that is just common sense.",1480636800,,4246,4.5149544863459035

3875520,3,B0028YW37E,"The Crypt is about a small group of people who discover there is a maze of crypts underneath the city, where a bunch of tombs lay of people who where buried with their personal valuables because they thought the government was going to steal them or something. It's no spoiler to tell you that the place is haunted, and the ghosts do not want their jewels and things taken, and will defend. You can just hear the screams of ""this is a movie about the group of them trying to get back out, right?"" ... yup. It sure is.

The acting of the movie is not too bad, especially judging by the trailer, I thought it was going to be very bad. The visual is kinda dodgy in the beginning of outside shots, but once in the crypts, it's a decent enough visual atmosphere with acceptable lighting. The sound is good, the score fits well, and the plot of the whole thing is OK up until towards the end of the movie. There is a scene where a ghost is staring at them under water... and from here on in until the end, the whole thing lost the plot and went lame. The ghost looked stupid and the events that followed where ridicules, and then the very end it made me think ""What? Is that it? Why did they even bother to do that?"" just like in the very first 5 minutes of the movie, a scene happens to a guy in a car, and after the film was over, I kept thinking to myself, ""what did that have to do with anything? Why was it even written, shot, edited and put into the movie at all?, it had nothing to do with anything""

Rent it if you are interested, or D/L it, but I really recommend you see this before thinking about purchasing it. I can't see it being something anyone would watch over and over and over again based on the assumption they think it's a good movie worth seeing more then a couple of times.",1308614400,,1790,4.140804597701149
