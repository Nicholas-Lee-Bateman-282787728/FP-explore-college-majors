5737641,5,B00CSALPOU,I will be glad when the 3rd Season comes out so I will only have one more to get and then I will start on one of the other collections I half to finish.,1387843200,3,152,3.5
5737642,3,B00CSALPOU,I had to pay another 15 for this DVD because the sender didn't tick the right box on the parcel. So all in all this DVD has cost me around 50. Not Happy!,1377820800,,153,3.6666666666666665
5737643,5,B00CSALPOU,"Never thought i would see this series on dvd.go buy it. picture and sound quality 5stars. I have Maverick, Cheyenne, and i just wish they would bring out Bronco. and Lawman all these western series are great. Hope they bring out series two in Sugarfoot' pretty soon.",1377561600,7,266,4.680851063829787
5737644,2,B00CSALPOU,While the quality of the episodes was Great - MANY episodes on Multiple discs would not play through often freezing or skipping within the first minute!,1377043200,2,152,4.884615384615385
5737645,1,B00CSALPOU,"Not for the first time have I received a defective product from Warner Brothers on Demand. Their product control must be non existent. Chapters in wrong places, disc freezing and backdown, item missing.
This is extremely disappointing as I was so much revisiting this much loved western.
In addition, to return the product cost me twice as much as the Amazon allowance....pathetic.
BE WARNED....The DVD plays up and in my case one of the four discs wasn't even packaged...When you pay top dollar as your do with Warner Bros. by demand you expect and deserve much better",1375747200,5,569,4.876288659793815
5737646,5,B00CSALPOU,"It's great to see Warner Brothers finally releasing their classic TV westerns from the 1950s, we can only hope they continue and release the other great series like Lawman, Colt 45 and Dakotas with Larry Ward & Jack Elam. Jack is great in this dark, gritty western series that was well ahead of it's time and well worth viewing.",1374624000,5,328,4.576271186440678
5737647,3,B00CSALPOU,"I was too young to watch ""Sugarfoot"" when it was new, but I remember watching it in reruns as a kid.  It was what got me hooked on Sarsaparilla!  So I was very excited to see it released on DVD ... except that this price is pretty high, especially for just 20 episodes.

OK, so I can stop looking forward to it coming out on DVD and can now start looking forward to it becoming reasonably priced.",1374105600,4,396,4.116883116883117
5737648,5,B00CSALPOU,"FINALLY WB HAS PUT OUT THE SECOND OF THE BIG THREE WESTERNS OF THE 50'S...CHEYENNE WAS FIRST...NOW SUGARFOOT HAS BEEN ISSUED....WAITING FOR BRONCO...AS FOR THIS FIRST SEASON OF SUGARFOOT IT IS GREAT  TO SEE THE UNCUT VERSIONS ...IF YOU LIKE THE WB/""ORR"" WESTERNS GET THIS FIRST SEASON OF SUGARFOOT... I SHOULD HAVE SAID THE SECOND OF THE BIG FOUR WARNER BROTHERS WESTERNS...MAVERICK, CHEYENNE, SUGARFOOT, AND BRONCO...!!!",1370822400,10,421,5.378787878787879
5737649,3,B00CSALPOU,"Will Hutchins portrayal of Sugarfoot coming across as a wide eyed innocent trusting everyone during the first season did not wash with me.  I hope, after all the varmints he was forced to gun down, he comes across as a more astute hombre in subsequence seasons.",1461196800,,261,4.673913043478261
5737650,5,B00CSALPOU,"Will Hutchins was perfect as the clean cut, young tenderfoot know as 'Sugarfoot'. His sometime nave innocent style often led the 'bad guys' into a sort of false sense of security when dealing with him, but if riled enough Will, or 'Tom Brewster' as his character was called, could out draw or punch with the best of them!  Only certain kinds of actors could play this role convincingly, and Will Hutchins fit the bill just right! In the 40's it could have been James Stewart, Robert Cummings or Fred MacMurray! Heard Will Hutchins in an interview decades later, call his character 'Sweet Toes'!",1458777600,,594,4.766990291262136
5737651,5,B00CSALPOU,A great western. Well acted sugarfoot. Good stories,1453420800,,51,5.5
5737652,5,B00CSALPOU,A time capsule of my youth. I am my 60's now and that young in his 80's I am sure he feels the same. This show was the only one he starred  I'm sure Will Hutchins holds this show in high esteem.,1436313600,,194,3.619047619047619
5737653,3,B00CSALPOU,"There are always two ways to review products like this one:  the physical product and the content.  I found the DVDs to be very well done and am thoroughly satisfied with the package...no complaints.  So, I'll write a few lines for fans of old TV westerns out there and you all can take my remarks for what they're worth to you.

Granted, this series was shot during the late 1950s, but it displays a level of corn-pone writing and acting from the lead character that would make even Jim & Margaret Anderson shake their heads.  Acting from the side characters is usually pretty good (as is the case with all Warner westerns), but Will Hutchins' lead, Tom Brewster, should have waited for ""Little House on the Prairie.'  He's a blond version of James Best (even *talks* like him!), but without Best's awesome acting ability.

Most of the stories suffer from having to twist the plot around Brewster's over-the-top do-gooderness, and most pay the price for it.  He's shown to de-tooth even the most hardened criminals just by laying one of his 'mom and apple pie' speeches on him.  ""The Bullet and the Cross,"" with Charles Bronson is particularly embarrassing.

I guess this series is a 'must' for any serious collector of 1st-gen TV westerns, but it is in no way in the class of ""Cheyenne,"" ""Lawman,"" or ""The Rifleman.""",1433635200,5,1318,4.716157205240175
5737654,5,B00CSALPOU,"Oddly enough, this old black and white television series actually keeps your attention.  The plot revolves around an annoying, sometimes bumbling, socially inept wanderer.  He supports himself with odd jobs as he drifts across the West and is studying to be a lawyer through a correspondence course.  He normally shows up in a town to take a test or get his course work from the post office.  He doesn't carry a gun, but has the ability to utilize it whenever needed surprising all gunman who challenge him.  The acting is top notch and some episodes actually keep you riveted to the television.  I was surprised by the quality of this show as I had never heard of it before.  The quality of the shows visually is excellent.",1420761600,4,724,4.653543307086614
5737655,4,B00CSALPOU,"watching as a kid we would wait for the theme music to begin to see if it was ceyenne, bronco, or sugarfoot .... if it was sugarfoot we
would whine and go out to play. I've since grown up and learned a good western isn't all about guns and Indians.
very good show with great guest stars and future great stars. if you've seen any recent hutchins interviews he pretty much played himself in the series. I got bronco the same day and I alternate discs like when it first aired, keeps the show from getting stale.",1410134400,,510,4.268041237113402
5737656,5,B00CSALPOU,Not only did he play in this series but he played in two of Elvis movies.  I would liked to have seen him in more movies but this is a good series to showcase his talents.,1401235200,,171,3.75
5737657,5,B00CSALPOU,"Sure, it has an occasional light episode (like most Westerns including Bonanza and Gunsmoke) but for the most part Tom 'Sugarfoot' Brewster deals with the same kind of serious situations that the others do. The difference, of course, is that he is clearly not a man used to the tough ways of the West, though he does learn how to take care of himself, even with guns or fists if he has to, though he clearly doesn't like to. All in all, a good show.",1392854400,9,449,4.294117647058823
5737658,5,B00CSALPOU,"I could only remember this with fond memories of watching with my grandpa so I ordered both season one and two. This show is so good, can,t wait until season three is release. I wish they could still make westerns, but we either don,t have very good actors they try to over act, or the writers  don,t have it. Either way I am glad I was born in the era of good TV",1392508800,5,363,3.9726027397260273
8585734,5,B00CSALPOU,It brought back many memories! I enjoyed it !,1527465600,,45,4.111111111111111
8585735,4,B00CSALPOU,"It's been 60 years since I first watched the Sugarfoot series, and the stories are all fresh and new to me now! I love seeing all the old westerns from back in the day and I look forward to adding the rest of the seasons now available. As such I rate the series quite high, but I do have to take issue with the quality of the DVD,s. While the image on screen is clear enough, there were numerous pauses or video freeze-ups that could not be resolved. In fact, 3 episodes had to be skipped over entirely due to their incapability to be watched. I don't know if this is because this product was made "" on demand "" , but for the money we spend on these old shows the quality should be good enough to allow you to watch them more than once before you encounter problems. I don't know if other seasons of Sugarfoot can be bought through other sources, but I will at least investigate how the videos are produced before I buy .",1523750400,,921,4.150837988826815
8585736,5,B00CSALPOU,I bought this because a number of stories were written by or based on Louis L'Amour stories. Sugarfoot had never screened in New Zealand so this is my first exposure to this 1950's TV series.  Have watched one episode so far and find it a nostalgic experience.  DVD Set arrived well packaged and within expected timeframes.,1520812800,,323,4.75
8585737,5,B00CSALPOU,"I watched these when I was a kid and had a crush on Will Hutchins, he is so cute. Glad to have them in my house to watch whenever I want",1496361600,,136,3.4193548387096775
8585738,5,B00CSALPOU,"I grew up watching all the TV westerns during the 60's and 70's and decided to check out some of the older ones like Maverick, Cheyenne, Bronco, and Sugarfoot. I love all of them more than the ones I watched as a teenager, but I have to say that Sugarfoot is by far my favorite. Will Hutchins plays such a lovable cowboy, always helping others in need, presenting a naive if not innocent persona, yet he can be as tough as any cowboy when he's provoked enough and no one is faster at the draw. What makes Tom Brewster such a standout actor in this role are the layers of personality traits he portrays so effortlessly. This is never so true as when he is also playing the Canary Kid, his look-a-like cousin who show up on a few episodes. And finally Will Hutchins is as nice and humble in real life as his character Sugarfoot...a gem of a person. Check out Western Clippings where he has written several articles under the name a Touch of Hutch. He is quite a story teller!",1493251200,4,973,4.3224043715847

8585742,5,B00CSALPOU,excellent good simple stories,1472947200,,29,6.5
8585743,5,B00CSALPOU,"I watched this show as a child, and wondered how it would ""wear"" after all of these years.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I haven't watched the entire season yet, but so far every disc has played fine.  Perhaps typical of the 1950's or the genre, every episode has a happy ending.  I would recommend both this and Cheyenne, another favorite of my childhood.  I looked up both Will Hutchins (Sugarfoot) & Clint Walker (Cheyenne), and was happy to learn that both are still living---",1470700800,,480,4.666666666666667
