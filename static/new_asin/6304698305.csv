917725,5,6304698305,"Yep it is the grumpy duo (Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon) at it again only this time they are ""Out to Sea.""

Herb Sullivan (Lemmon) widower, is reminiscing his wedding anniversary. He seemed a little down. So his good friend Charlie (Matthau), yeah sure, invites him on a FREE cruse to cheer him up. Now I am not saying that Charlie has something up his sleeve but is cosigning up to Liz (Dyan Cannon); she appears to be a wealthy and attractive co-passenger. And soon Herb finds out what FREE really means.

The story is not as important as the one liners and some good acting from quite a few veteran actors that can really put on a song and dance performance.",1504483200,,662,4.418032786885246

I now have a useless DVD that will not play in my region and have no time to jump through my a$$ to get it back to the company that sold it to the US without question as to why I would order something I couldn't possibly use here.

918249,5,6304698305,"This film might better be titled, ""A Cruise for Geriophiles.""  Dyan Cannon, at age sixty, give or take a year, is the eyecandy in this film, as is, perhaps, Hal Linden, at age sixty-five, approximately.  Other stars include Gloria DeHaven, a dozen years Dyan's senior.  Walter Matthau was five years Gloria's senior, and Jack Lemon was her age. Golden Girl, Rue McClanahan, was in her sixties at the time this film was released.  Perusing the list of cast members, I discovered one man, Sean O'Bryan, born in the 1960's, but I don't remember his character from watching the film.

If frisky senior citizens nauseate you, this film is not for you.  If you can look past the wrinkles and gray or thinning hair, et cetera, and enjoy the sometimes vulgar humor (especially in the bloopers at the end), as well as the romance, nostalgia, luxurious settings, and exotic locations, then this film is for you!",1469750400,,901,4.780645161290322

919073,4,6304698305,"***This review may contain spoilers***

As another Amazon reviewer has already noted, Out to Sea (hereafter OTS) is basically a melding of Grumpy Old Men (or The Odd Couple, take your pick) with a typical Love Boat episode.  Before you groan and decide this is something you might want to skip, I wish to assure you that comic and acting (and sadly, now departed) legends Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon effortlessly turn on the smooth, wacky, exasperated, and cunning charm to make OTS a laugh-filled, satisfying, if somewhat predicatable romp.

The frantic fun begins when Matthaus character Charlie Gordon, a shifty gambler in hock with several bookies and loan sharks, persuades his despondent, widowed brother-in-law Herb Sullivan (Lemmon) to take a cruise with him on-board the Holland America liner Westerdam presumably to cheer him up.  When Herb protests that neither of them can afford a cruise, Charlie assures him that he managed to wrangle free tickets.  Herb grudgingly agrees.

Of course theres a catch.  Only after they board the ship does Charlie inform Herb that in exchange for the free room and board, they must serve as dancing partners and escorts for unattached women passengers.  Though Herb is understandably agitated with Charlie for this con, he figures he and Charlie can make the best of it.  After all, cruises have all sorts of amenities and benefits, and the Central America/Mexico itinerary is enticing. Besides, Herb is a good dancer. But, of course, there are other catches.

One, while Herb can trip the light fantastic, Charlie cant.  In fact, Charlie has all the dancing grace of the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.  Two, their boss is the despotic, brown-nosing, and smugly irritating martinet Gil Godwin (Brent Spiner, in a role as diametrically opposite to his unemotional, rational role as Data the android from Star Trek  The Next Generation as a role can be). Gil is the cruise director from hell with a soul of a drill instructor.  He warns all the dance partners that dancing is as far as it goes with the women passengers.  Any kind of relationship, even the most casual, is strictly forbidden.  Naturally, Gil keeps a haughty eye on Herb and Charlie  especially Charlie, who spends much of the movie shirking his dancing duties and dodging and disobeying Gils edicts.

And so OTS launches into a comedy of deception, mistaken identity, and screwball antics.  Besides avoiding Gil, Charlie keeps busy by playing poker against the snobbish, wealthy card expert Cullen Carswell and doggedly wooing the apparently glamorous, well-to-do Liz LaBreche (a still stunning Dyan Cannon), traveling with her ornery, cantankereous mother Mavis (Elaine Stritch) who wants her to marry someone worthy of her social station and who instantly disapproves of Charlie.  Meanwhile, the more subdued Herb finds his own romantic interaction with Vivian (Gloria DeHaven), a fetching widow traveling with her grown daughter and son-in-law.  They are mutually attracted to each other.  Problem is, Vivian, through Charlies interference, believes Herb is a doctor.  Herb is actually a retired Gimbels sales clerk, but is afraid to tell Vivian the truth because he doesnt want to disappoint her.  Besides, Herb still stubbornly yearns for his deceased wife of 46 years, Susie.

Again, the plot is straight out of any Love Boat episode, but Matthau and Lemmon are consummate, confident pros who can squeeze laughs out of the most outlandish doings.  Through both physical slapstick and quick and sharp dialogue, Matthau and Lemmon seem to be having a ball in OTS and therefore let us have fun, too.  And yet, good comedies always have a core of emotion and pathos.  Both Matthau and Lemmon have it in OTS and so we hope that they can rise above the sticky deceptions and white lies they have built and find love and fulfillment.  Do they?  Well, think about any Love Boat episode and how it turns out that Herb and Charlie aren't the only ones harboring secrets in the movie, not least Gil and his shameless flattering of ship owner Ellen Carruthers (Rue McClanahan) in order to secure a promotion, and rest assured that poetic justice comes into play.

P.S.:  Although I have been on several cruises with several cruise lines, including Holland America, I have never been on the Westerdam.  OTS showcases the ship well and Im sure Holland America was grateful for the publicity.  I would love to take a trip on the Westerdam someday.",1418774400,,4454,5.006793478260869

I laughed and laughed watching this oh so funny movie. Walter and Jack may have been in their twilight years when making this film but they certainly weren't slowed down much. Same goes for the rest of the mature cast. Not only is it hilarious, there are also some good messages to be learned too including NOT writing off people of a 'certain age' as past it! These golden guys and girls were also mover-groovers! Loved those dance sequences.

The captain showed up with some of the other crew (including the Head Chef) at 1:00 am in the lounge/disco and we taught them also. Wow, what a cruise.

This movie is terrifically funny and brings back fond memories. Lemon plays the straight man and Matthau is so funny that I will wager that it took many takes because the caste probably couldn't stop laughing.

Jack portrays a widower and his unique self depreciating style makes him very believable.  Walter, just like his ""Oscar Madison"" character, is always conniving, trying to make money.  It really is almost a spin-off of the ""Odd Couple"" as to how they both interact.  Instead of the ""Pigeon Sisters"" this time we have Gloria DeHaven who was a perfect choice for Herb's romantic interest.  Dyan Cannon looks like she's having a blast as she's torn between Charlie or Edward Mulhare as Cullen Carswell.

The music is great.  ""Commander Data"", Brent Spiner, is a good choice for the ""cruise die-wreck-tor, his pronunciation.  Rue McClanahan plays the very concerned for the passengers owner of the ship.

The story is about two friends, widower Herb (Lemmon) and his care-free scheming brother-in-law Charlie (Matthau), who end up with a free cruise when they pose as dance instructors.  The only catch is they have to dance with the single women on board.  Herb, the one who doesn't even want to be there, is the only one of the two that takes this job seriously, and in the process falls for Vivian (Gloria De Haven), a recently widowed woman who's tagged along with her daughter on her honeymoon.  Charlie on the other hand has his eye on the younger, wealthier Liz (Dyan Cannon).  All the while their plans of romance are thrown off by the high-strung cruise director Gil Godwyn (Brent Spiner) who's vying for a promotion.  There are plenty of funny spots here, and not a dull moment, and as a nice touch it ends on a very happy and somewhat heartwarming note.  Great fun and loads of laughs all on the seven seas!",1152576000,10,1144,4.524271844660194
920179,4,6304698305,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are considered one of the great film teams.  Their partnership created 11 films (one film Walter starred in Jack directed and two films they both appeared in but were not the costars) over 32 years and created the one of the most beloved pairings, Oscar Madison and Felix Unger.

Out to Sea was the 10th film and it is a rehash of many of their other films (together and apart).  Herb (Lemmon) is a widower.  Charlie (Matthau) is his brother-in-law.  Just as Oscar and Felix, Herb and Jack are opposites.  Charlie has gotten into some trouble with loan sharks and needs to get away for a while.  He decides to take a cruise and takes his brother in law along.

The thing that he doesn't tell him is the reason it is free is that they are to be dance hosts.  And there is one strict rule that they are not to fraternize with the paying guests.  But Charlie is planning to catch himself a rich widow.  And on the airplane Herb meets a beautiful widow (Gloria DeHaven).  But Charlie introduces Herb as his doctor.  Herb runs into her, of course, on the boat and tries to keep up his cover.

Charlie stumbles into a state room and meets an heiress (Dyan Cannon) and her mother (Elaine Strich.)  Of course Charlie goes after the daughter.  And the cruise director (Brent Spiner) is trying to catch the boys.

There is a lot of deception going on but it is not just the boys.  In the end the boys get the girls and we have a happy ending.

Jack and Walter are masters of their craft. And while this film is as creaky as they come, the cast make it work.  Dyan Cannon gives one of her best performances (probably since her Oscar nominated work in Heaven Can Wait.)  And it is great to see Gloria DeHaven back in front of the cameras - and looking fabulous!  Donald O'Connor gets to show he still can dance as one of the host along with Hal Linden.  Golden Girl Rue McClannahan also makes an appearance as the owner of the ship.

As I have said before a bad Lemmon Matthau film is better than most other films.

Finding this out, Jack has to entertain old ladies and women that are alone on the cruise line. All while trying to overcome the loss of his wife, Jack decides to try out the dance thing. Little did he know, Walter is ""cruising chicks"", and has his eye on Diane Cannon, who thinks Walter M. is a rich guy. The scams and jokes played on this movie will make you laugh. This is a funny movie, but does have some bad language, so I wouldn't recommend this for kids under 13. I must say, for old guys they sure can crack up the younger generation.

920183,4,6304698305,"You've got a number of stars in this comedy! Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon star as a pair of friends who go to sea as Gentlemen Escorts to find new romance. In essence they are free dance partners for the many single woman on board.

Jack promptly falls for Vivian (Gloria DeHaven) as a true romance, while Walter Matthau schemes to seduce a younger woman (Dyan Cannon) who appears wealthy and single. The ship is the Holland Westerdam, an actual luxury cruise ship. You get to see a lot of scenes on the ship - from the pool area, the restaurant, the ballroom and the deck.

I really loved the smaller parts played by Hal Linden and especially Brent Spiner. The ""Data"" from Star Trek really shines here as the commanding cruise director.

What makes the movie so special is that, in its release year of 1997, you had Lemmon being 71 years old, and Matthau being 77. The two men are still great actors. It gives you a great sense of how vibrant old age can be, if you keep your mind and body healthy. Sadly, both have since passed away, so this movie is a collector's item.

What was even more surprising to me is how young Dyan Cannon looks. I loved her in Deathtrap, and while I watched this movie I thought she was a great actress but way too young for the Matthau character. I kept thinking of him as a cradle robber. Actually, she was born in 1937 - so she was 50 in the movie! In comparison, Gloria was 72.

So in general, this was a cast with a lot of experience, that shows a great movie can be made without having to rely on teen starlets or the latest handsome face.

Matthau is a great comedian and Lemmon is heartbreaking as a man who never thought he could fell in love again. As a team they are perfect, as usual. But the real stars in this movie are the supporting actors. Brent Spiner gives the performance of his life as cruise-director. His show-numbers alone are worth watching this film. And there is Donald O'Connor in a small but wonderful part (you don't believe his age if you see him dance - just amazing!). The soundtrack is lovely. It's a very funny film.

920235,3,6304698305,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau work well together. They are amusing and seem to be able to sense how to react together without having to think about. That quality is present in ""Out to Sea"" but it is not enough to carry the weight of the entire film.

The premise is one of two elderly genltemen without wives. One is a batchelor and schemer and the other is a widower who is straight laced. Neither are what could be called wealthy. The schemer cons his friend (and former brother in law) into taking a cruise. The htich is that he has signed them up to work as professional dance partners to dance with the ladies. When this comes to light, Mr. Straight hits the ceiling and is ready to leave. Unfortunately the ship has already left and he is stuck working or paying a huge bill. The schemer has a reason for his deception, however. He is looking to get a wealthy wife. His friend has no such ambitions.

The plot is one with much potential for comedy. Indeed, there are plenty of moments for smiles and laughs. So too are there more tender moments that can tug at the heartstrings. The problem is that it just doesn't hold together was well as it could. Though each of the stars does a good job, more could have been done with the script.

Jack makes small talk with a lovely mature lady, the first who has caught his eye since his wife died. Meanwhile Walter eyes the wealthy ones ... Walter leads Jack to the upper class suites, where they plan to unpack that is ... until the cabin steward leads Dyan Cannon and her mother to the room. Both Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon go to their lower deck cabin. Later, they 'suit up' to become ""dance hosts"" which is how they earn their free cruise. They meet Brent Spiner, the ambitious Cruise Director, whose management style is 'total control' as he aims to influence Rue Mchalanahan (owner of the ship) to advance his career.

As luck would have it, Walter Matthau selects Rue as his dance partner, and shows her moves with his feet and hands like no other dance host on board ... the other dance hosts stare in awe and amazement, as the Cruise Director seithes with anger, while alter essentially paws his dance partner during dips and twirls. She is thrilled with the experience to the chagrin of the Cruise Director ... Walter manages to feign a foot injury, and gets into a card game with Wall Street businessmen. He wins a few hands of poker and receives an $18,000.00 check from the loser, impressing Dyan Cannon, who appears to be wealthy young woman but is a ""gold digger"" ... looking to find a ""sugar daddy"".

Afterwards, Walter separates Dyan away from the Wall Street mogul and he escorts her on a land tour in Mexico. The Cruise Director follows him,  trying to prove he faked injury and thereby make him pay for the cruise, at double cost. The chase is on ... with marvelous scenes including a plane ride by the lady passengers, whom Walter and Jack are trying to win over. Needless to say, using clever ploys each man wins the lady of his dreams. Brent Spiner is tricked into ""performing"" in ways he never imagined, to influence Rue to select him for career advancement. Overall, this film is filled with unforgettable funny moments from beginning to end. There is superb acting by many well known male and female entertainers who engage in comedy routines and clever antics ... Most highly enjoyable.

One of the best performances came from Brent Spiner as the cruise director from hell Gil Godwyn complete with English accent and everything. If you have only seen Spiner as Data in Star Trek then you are in for a nice surprise.
It is nice to see a movie though, that does not rely on big budget SFX. Nice to see actors acting for a change.",1085011200,6,474,4.277777777777778

While the story is simple, they go on a crusie and pretend to be dance hosts and fall in love. But it is matthau and lemmon make this film shine. Along with some great supproting performances Brent Spiner, Donald O'Connor,Rue Mchlanahan, Dyan Cannon and Elaine Stritch delievers some the of the best lines in this film.

This movie has a great character performance by Brent Spiner (Lt. Cmdr. Data on Star Trek The Next Generation). He plays a flamboyant cruise director who drives the two men crazy!
He's funny and his boss is Rue McClanihan steals the show with her arogance and pride. Diane Cannon has some very funny moments to.
The bottom line is Walter is a con-man, and Lemon is a Widower that was dragged on this cruise and both get more than they expected. A cute and funny film.",1024531200,,563,4.371428571428571
920242,3,6304698305,"I don't really want to repeat what other reviewers have already stated. For a Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon pairing, I thought this movie was somewhat average. Nothing great. Seeing some of the older stars who haven't appeared in recent movies was a nice addition. I would still recommend their older movies over this one.
However, Gil Godwyn was the one nice touch to the movie. Seeing Brent Spiner (Lt. Commander Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation) in this type of role was wonderful. My parents hated the movie but felt Spiner stole the show. I love to see performers play different types of roles, and I feel Spiner excelled here.",1012694400,,639,4.714285714285714

920305,2,6304698305,". . .and a hideously weak plot.
My wife and I are both fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau.  Together, they have produced some hysterical films, most notably ""Grumpy Old Men"".  This film, I'm sad to say, is merely a shadow of what it could have been.
The basic plot -- an elderly (yet charming) con-man tricks his recently widowed brother-in-law into taking a cruise.  Enormous humor could have been derived from this basic premise -- but unfortunately, enormous humor was NOT the result.  The plot was shallow and predictable, and the humor muted.  While there were a few points at which I laughed, it is certainly not the comedy classic ""Grumpy Old Men"" was.
I can't imagine ever caring to see this film again.",996624000,2,714,4.634920634920635

Once on the cruise they meet the tight ass cruise director Gil  Godwyn who is always out through the whole movie to get the two in trouble.  Lots of great fun, and comedy!  And even a little romance.

This time,they are posing as  ""dance hosts"" aboard a luxury cruise liner.  There's a few  problems, though.  First of all, Charley, (played by Walter Matthau), is  REALLY in search of a babe with a big bank account, and Herb, (played by  Jack Lemmon), does NOT know how to dance!  although there are moments of  extreme silliness, all in all, I thought this movie was a riot; packed full  of funny, laugh-out-loud moments!  In addition,Brent Spiner is an absolute  scream as the sadistic cruise director!
