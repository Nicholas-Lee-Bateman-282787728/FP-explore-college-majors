I originally found this movie in a bargain box at Big Lots and gave it to my brother as a funny gift.  He lost it and I found it here, so I re-gifted it to him for Father's Day.  I haven't watched the movie, so don't take this rating as quality film rating.",1501027200,,354,3.9577464788732395
8113734,5,B000ERVK62,"This movie is the more clever Spanish version of the film Amelie. I love it. It's witty, it's romantic, it's fun. Great acting, great price.",1316390400,,140,4.64
8113735,3,B000ERVK62,"OK, so this is not the best comedy I have ever seen, but my girlfriend and I still really enjoyed it.

True, it drew heavily from other foreign films we have enjoyed. Right off, I noticed clear elements of Amelie and maybe some references to Wings of Desire (with the flying trapeze). Also, some of the subject matter of the comedy involved things that in the real world might have been seen as tragic and very unethical, but the movie makes it clear from the start that its intent is to be a lighthearted comedy so questionable acts slide by as being simply ridiculous (like bits in some US comedies); strangely enough I was more forgiving of their humor in this film.

We liked it enough that we picked up an extra copy for co-worker from Spain that works in a lab (NOT a fertility lab).",1292544000,,789,4.397260273972603
8113736,2,B000ERVK62,"Many articles say American comedies don't do well abroad, unlike action films.  Comedy is culturally-specific.  I can relate now.  This work was supposed to be funny, but I just wasn't feeling it.
At first, this reminded me of ""Forest Gump"" in that important world events coincided with events for the main character.  But really this may be a Spanish ""Amelie.""  The visuals, characters, and facial expressions will remind you of that film greatly.
The film has an important message that you never know what life is going to throw at you.  However, the main character does two things here that are highly unethical.  It's not really a laughing matter.
This work was hard for me to embrace, though I'm sure the makers had good intentions.",1239580800,,737,4.848
