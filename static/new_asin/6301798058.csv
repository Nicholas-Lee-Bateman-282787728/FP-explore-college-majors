362830,5,6301798058,"There is so much good stuff in this movie! In addition to enjoying the stunning performances, you can see actual live footage of Jim Europe's 369th ""Hell Fighters"" Infantry Band in their triumphal march in  New York after World War I interspersed with the movie's footage. Jim  Europe, one of the founding fathers of jazz, was killed in 1919, so they  had to use an actor to portray him in Stormy Weather. Much of the music  featured at the beginning of the movie was material performed by Jim  Europe.  Another fun detail is that the middle sequence of the movie, in  which Gabe (the bootblack) arrives as an angel to save the show from the  balkiness of the chorus girls, is based on an incident that actually  happened to Eubie Blake. And notice how the sequence with Cab Calloway  starts out: Cab invites Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson to participate  in a benefit for the soldiers. When Cab and Bojangles first met in real  life, Bo was trying to get Cab to participate in a benefit performance. Cab  didn't want to do it, and they got into a fight. Cab finally did go along  with it, and he and Bo became friends after that. The scene where Bojangles  punches Chick Bailey is right in character, too. Bojangles loved to fight.  Fats Waller's parting line, ""One never knows, do one,"" was  unscripted. It was one of his favorite lines, and he ended his recordings  with it frequently, squeezing it in at the last second. Now, this isn't  exactly a movie review, but these are details that have added enormously to  my enjoyment of this movie.",961718400,20,1541,4.595588235294118
362831,5,6301798058,"First thing...If this is what Harlem was like in the 40's it was jammin.  First of all Lena Horne has to be the classiest woman alive (then and now).  Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson is great, giving just the right amount  of humor and entertainment.  And of course, nobody I mean NOBODY, was as  bad as Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers (who Fred Astaire by the way  fancied some of his tap dancing moves from - I saw it on numerous PBS  specials that he was a major fan of theirs).  Although it may have some  stereotypical parts in it, it is wonderful to see a movie where black  people were respectful to one another, classy dressers and had good times  with one another.
The best part of this film?  In a way it is very hard  for me to pinpoint...I love when Fats Waller and Ida Wells start signing  ""Having  yourself a Ball"".  My grandparents used to sing it and  lord knows Fats and Ida are singing the hell out if it!  But the absolute  BEST part has to be the finale when Cab is signing ""Jumpin Jive""  and the Nicholas Brothers dance on that staircase.  This was a fantastic  all-black hollywood musical.  Thank God for video and DVD!",960940800,88,1142,4.358851674641149
362832,5,6301798058,"I'm only a 13 year old  girl, and I think Stormy Weather is fun and outstanding! I love all the people in it too. I also relized that some of the people who play in this movie, star in some of the Betty Boop cartoons.  But, I really, really admire this movie, and I will always treasure it for  being one of the best movies at the top of my movie shelf! So, if your a  fan on classical movies, you should really buy Stormy weather. It was made  in 1942.",955670400,4,453,3.934065934065934
362833,5,6301798058,"This movie gives a good incite on the state of affairs in the black world in that time period.  Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, and Bill Robinson gave a wonderful performance and so did the supporting cast. I really enjoyed it.  A black movie where the characters didn't have to curse and be vulgar to be  recognized.",924739200,2,311,4.517857142857143
362834,5,6301798058,"Maybe it's true that the plot of this movie isn't all that great, but that's not what Stormy Weather is for. To a large extent, this movie is Bojangle's biography. Bojangles does a spectacular job not only dancing,  but also acting and singing, and I think he's reasonably convincing as  Lena's love interest considering that he was 70 years old when this movie  was made. (He looks like he's in his thirties.) Then there's Fats Waller...  any footage of him is to be treasured. His performance with Ada Brown is  absolutely classic Fats. The saddest thing about this movie is that we lost  Fats immediately after the filming -- he died on the train on the way home  at the age of 39. The end of this movie is so rousing, we feel like  climbing through our television screen and onto the set to join in the  dancing. Cab Calloway is in fine form in his famous zoot suit!",916531200,10,870,4.421383647798742

The movie contains many great stars.  I love Lena Horne, Bill Robinson, and Cab Callaway.  Lena Horne singing ""Stormy Weather"" is wonderful. However, I need to add that there is a dance act by the Nicholas Brothers that may be my personal favorite dance performance ever.",1474761600,,466,4.679012345679013

363073,3,6301798058,"STORMY WEATHER is a very unique film in a few respects. Given the time period it was made in, having an all-Black cast was probably pretty rare. It also affords a look at Black entertainers that few other films of the time had done. Still, there are extremely racist depictions that might not sit well with modern audiences. That aside, though, STORMY WEATHER has some amazing musical and dance numbers which may be enough to make you temporarily forget how much of a minstrel show the film really is. My personal favorites were Lena Horne's opening number ""No Two Ways About Love,"" the title song, and ""Jumpin' Jive,"" which has some of the best dancing ever recorded on film, courtesy of the Nicholas Brothers. The plot is nothing to write home about, but in a lot of ways, that really isn't the point. It's a showcase of Black talent, for better or worse (there is a scene where two characters put on blackface for a very racist/stereotypical vaudeville sketch), and talent on display is top-notch.",1457654400,3,1000,4.72

This is a great movie, but hard to find. It currently is not available in Movies Unlimited or TCM catalogs. Besides being one of the best Hollywood musicals, it is one of the few places you can see a lot of the great black musicians and performers of the 1930's and 1940's. Here's a short list of my favorites, but there are more: Lena Horne, Bill Robinson, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Fayard and Harold  Nicholas. For those who may not know, the Nicholas brothers were two of the best dancers ever.

363209,4,6301798058,"This is probably not a  well known movie.  It was produced in 1943 and stars notables like Lena Horne, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Cab Calloway and a whole cast of talented comedians and dancers.  What's really significant about this film is that all of the players are African Americans, including the orchestras, choruses, and chorus lines.

The story line  goes like this:  Bill Robinson is relating his showbiz experience to a group of children who call him ""Uncle Bill.""  The story starts from the early days of post WWI where Bill has returned from the war---complete with uniform and comes to a nightclub with his buddy and a girlfriend.  He is introduced to his future love Lena Horne---who has another name in the film.  As the movie progresses this romance starts to bud, but the reality of being on the road all the time, the pressures of even getting a job in a club are great, and it becomes apparent that these two are not destined for the alter.

Nevermind the plot, what is awe inspiring is the talent here.  There is the famous Nicholas Brothers who also were seen in Sun Valley Serenade---they demonstrate in their gymnastic/acrobatic capabilities as well as  their talented feet what the human body can endure!  The comic team of Miller and Lyles who started their career as a vaudeville attraction capture the art of quick response and synchronization in their funny repertoire.  Fats Waller is at the piano and sings his famous Ain't Misbehavin' and also showcases Ada Brown singing ""That Ain't Right.""  The ""Hi-de-ho"" man Cab Calloway in all his zoot suit spendor and energy accompanied by his amazing band  contributes some memorable numbers like 'Gichi Joe.""  Bill Robinson proves his talent in one number where he taps his way from drum to drum in a Caribbean number.  And of course, the beautiful songstress Lena Horne's big number complete with artificial but realistic thunderstorms----Stormy Weather---really hits it out of the park.

If you're a music fan and want to go down memory lane to hear all these great people who brought the melodies of that era alive, this is a film to see!",1435795200,2,2114,4.838440111420613

It's a shame we didn't have more films like this from these stars.  I realize roles for Black Actors were scarce but something should have been written for them or made into vehicles for them, so we could enjoy more of their vast talents. Lena Horne stars with Cab Calloway & The Cotton Club Orchestra, The Nicolas Brothers, ""Fats"" Waller, Bill ""Bo Jangles"" Robinson, Dooley Wilson, Ada Brown and Katherine Dunham and her Dance Troupe and many uncredited singers and dancers.  Even ""Stymie"" makes an appearance as a stagehand and Nick Stewart, known to many as Nickodemus, Nick O'Demus and ""Lightnin'"" from the Amos & Andy TV show of the 1950's is on hand as well!

363778,5,6301798058,"First I would like to note that it is NOT Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, but Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson that's the star of this film alongside Lena Horne who is my all time favorite black actress and singer from the past.  I'm not sure who at Amazon messed that up, but it's a HUGE mistake.  Rochester is no where in the film.  Bojangles was in this film and also danced alongside Shirley Temple in many of her films.

Lena Horne's voice is sweet and beautiful and the song Stormy Weather is one of the greatest songs she ever song and one of the greatest songs from the forties.

I'm a fan of classic black and white films from the 40s and 50s and I recommend it to anyone who shares that same interest.  There aren't many classic black films like this left nowadays because they destroyed or lost many of them.  The fact that we still have a film like this nowadays is a true treasure that should be shared for as many generations as possible.",1398556800,,941,4.373563218390805

The cast, people such as Cab Calloway, are all great performers.  I was too young to remember ... about 2 1/2 ... when I met Mr. Calloway, as he and his wife were friends with Mother.

363960,5,6301798058,"This is a brilliant and entertaining film with spectacular production numbers and literally and all star cast from the 1940s. The opportunity to watch Lena Horne, Fats Waller, Cab Callaway and -- of course! -- Bill Bojangles Robinson on screen is a lifetime experience! There's an incredible dancing duet performed by the Nicholas Brothers that literally has to be seen multiple times to be believed. Of course the title song is performed with a ballet sequence midway through, and Lena Horne's voice is so much stronger than my aging memory had predicted.

For some reason or other, Amazon lists this as an Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson film. Mr Anderson is not in the film, and despite his many talents this is a film with so many wondrously good cast members that his absence is not at all significant to the film's enjoyment.

Yes, many stereotypes are portrayed in the film, includinge a vaudeville routine performed in black face (burnt cork) and white lips. That's what was going on in the 1940s, and the two actors who perform it are troupers.

If you like bebop, see it! If you like the blues, see it! If you can remember hearing, but never seeing Fats Waller or Cab Calloway perform, see it! And if you never witnessed the artistry of Bojangles or young and vibrant Lena Horne, by all means see it.

363964,5,6301798058,"Stormy Weather is a classic, filled with stars from the era and a movie plot that still works. However, the most outstanding part of this film for me is: Lena Horne's singing. Bill (Bo Jangles) Robinson's dancing. Fat' Waller's and Cab Calloway's performances; even the costume design electrify my senses. (I have a fashion design  background and I'm a jazz vocalist, as well).

This film also includes an unforgettable tap routine by the Nicholas Brothers that is a part of dance history. In fact, I read the following awhile back about this dance number: ""Fred Astaire once told the brothers that the ""Jumpin' Jive"" dance number in Stormy Weather was the greatest movie musical sequence he had ever seen.""

This movie is a must-see. Did I mention earlier it has an ""all-black"" cast? No? Maybe because to me, even though during that time period it was a very important part of Hollywood history -it's the whole dynamic of the movie that makes it compelling to watch -not skin color alone.

The plot, such as it was, was thin and simply involved a romance between Lena Horne and Bill `Bojangles' Robinson. Released by 20th Century Fox in 1943, it was in black-and-white. We also had Thomas `Fats' Waller singing and playing his own `Ain't misbehavin'', Cab Calloway with his orchestra doing his frenetic thing with `Geechy Joe' and `Rhythm cocktail', some acrobatic dancing from the Nicholas Brothers, and a full supporting cast of other singers and dancers. Dooley Wilson also appeared but he wasn't given anything to sing or play. The high spot of the film was Lena Horne's singing of the title track by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler, who also had a hand in the screenplay.

Actually, Bill Robinson may have been a little past his best - in the final number, it feels as though he's just warming up, and then he's finished. I'm not saying that he's bad, but based on his reputation, I'd hoped for a little more. But then any performer would have been overshadowed by the Nicholas Brothers' dancing: an incredible mixture of energy and acrobatics - if I saw it in a film today, I'd assume that there'd been some digital manipulation.

However, these great performances are stitched together with a dull plot. We're not given characters we can care about, and the romance is perfunctory - as though the actors aren't even trying to be convincing. Lots of classic moments, but it all adds up to a good film, not a great one.",1311120000,2,849,4.66

One of several ""race films"" produced by the major studios in the early 1940s (this one by 20th Century Fox), Stormy Weather offers a showcase of black entertainers. It features the incomparable Leana Horne, Fats Waller, Cab Calloway, Ada Brown, and Emmet 'Babe' Wallace singing. The dancing is also a treat, with headliner Bill Robinson (Mr. Bojangles), the Nicholas Brothers, and the Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe.  My favorite song is actually sung by the uncredited Babe Wallace--his creamy baritone rendition of ""African Dance"", a song with lyrics by Langston Hughes (!), is offered as a front for Robinson's wonderful dance across the tom-tom drums, but what a front it is. The stairs dance by the Nicholas Brothers is a marvel--Fred Astaire called it the single best dance routine ever captured on film. The plot is quite thin, even in a day when musical films typically had thin plots, but at least by setting Stormy Weather smack in the middle of the entertainment business, it provided ample opportunity for superb music and dancing. Production values are solid. The DVD offers an excellent version of the film, although the DVD commentary loses sight of the magic of the film and its performers with misplaced social commentary. Story Weather offers top flight entertainers in top flight club settings. If you love music and dance, you owe it to yourself to give it a whirl.  (Note that while the thumbnail for the cover notes that the film included Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson, it does not; his scenes were left on the cutting room floor.

364142,5,6301798058,"Stormy Weather is a larger than life collection of an all-singing, all-dancing biographical showcase of the very best of black entertainment in 1943- promoting music & dance & how the related importance & contribution is significant to the American Culture at large. It is classified as a historical treasure, & undeniable agreed to be within the top 5 of all-time best Black Films. Filmed & produced during World War II when segregation was pretty much legal in most cases- the movie represents a ""time capsule"", emblematic as a historical archetype with its problematic stereotypical racism indicative of the society of the time with its dehumanizing representation of Black People as an accepted tradition. The comical representation (of people) , conniving personalities, minstrel entertainment ""Miller & Lyles (i.e.-""Amos 'n' Andy type mentality), hyper obese (jolly) individuals, ""forced Africanism"", & vaudeville entertainment, were strictly addressed (& denoted) only to Black Folks.

Stormy Weather is an All Star Cast showcasing quality black performers. The narrative of the film is to set up the performances of the stars. The scene set-up is only secondary to the performance showcases themselves, so instead of only snippets of great Black music & dance- the movie offers a plethora of excellent Black art. It may be understood that Stormy Weather perhaps may be viewed as a ""music video within a video"", thus the narrative is the vehicle to aid in the music videos only, & thus the plot is essentially unimportant. Accordingly then, the story is a bit illogical whereas the film set-up is from the perspective of Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson looking back & sharing his life, career & accolades on his porch with the neighbor children, or perhaps (it might be) a love story between the characters on screen played by actors Bojangles & Lena Horne.

There were more than 20 musical numbers in the film, undoubtedly a ""gem of a musical"" offering such a wonderful range of performers of different genre. Notably- the divine Lena Horne, Mr. Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson (Fred Astaire called Mr. Robinson the greatest dancer of all time {additionally in four minutes eight seconds Robinson tapped 1,984 taps- that's eight per second a noted record breaker}), Cab Calloway & his Band is a major contributor to the quality of this movie (Mr. Calloway {IMHO} has more charisma than Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, & Armando Desante TOGETHER {some of Cab's most brilliant archival footage is right in this film!!!!!}), The Nicholas Brothers did an incomparable stereo & synchronized tap dance # to Cab's ""The Jumpin; Jive"" including ""leap-frog"" full splits (almost raggedy-Ann like) & returns (across dining tables, throughout the bands tables, down a staircase) in a brilliant artistic fashion (smiling nonstop), right into a chorus finale of 55 men & women dancers/singers doing ""My My, Ain't that Somethin'"" (Reprise). Other notables are Thomas ""fats"" Waller ""Ain't Misbehavin',"" (he's got real cool {and exaggerated} facial expressions on film), Ada Brown singing ""That Ain't Right"" to Fats Waller Bluesy Piano Band. Katherine Dunham's dance troupe of 10 doing ""Stormy Weather Ballet"" (Katherine Dunham led a world-famous dance troupe) was graceful & spectacular. Of Course Lena Horne doing ""Stormy Weather"", is a hit, but she did 3 other numbers that included some smooth & beautiful dance steps.

Stormy Weather is just what it was intended to be- diverting entertainment in a wartime world. Perhaps the stereotypes are bothersome, the story a bit illogical, but the talent and passion of the performers and the caliber of the music make it all worthwhile- then & now. So much of quality is lost in today's world. It was a pleasure to view this movie 10 times this week. :-)",1243555200,4,3775,5.185245901639345
364143,4,6301798058,"Music, not story, is the name of the game here.

""Stormy Weather"" provides an avenue for black singers, dancers and musicians of the mid-1940s to show off their talents. Too bad it was that way but at least putting these acts on screen in a movie format wasn't just black folks ""preaching to the choir."" This film gave a lot of white people a chance to see some great talent they might never have seen and, hopefully, helped some of these entertainers in their careers.

Bill Robinson and Lena Horne are the stars of the film, or should I say the main entertainers. Robinson is wonderful to watch throughout. He's not just a great dancer but an extremely likable guy. He comes across that way, anyway, and has in every film I've seen him. Horne has a good voice and a pretty face that became famous for almost never aging.

Since I prefer a little more up-tempo, Fats Waller, Cab Calloway and The Nicholas Brothers filled the bill nicely. They were awesome.

Also wanted to see beautiful Lena Horne, but disappointed that they didn't have her in beautiful gowns.  So, other than the Step Brothers dancing, I was bored.",1238544000,,480,4.678571428571429
364145,4,6301798058,"""Stormy Weather"" is a musical extravaganca that still enthralls today after  more than 65 years after its' intial release. This picture also has turned into a valuable musical historical treasure,showcasing some of the best black talents of the 20th Century. It is like an animated museum piece but there's no dust or relics here,brother. This film is still alive and vibrant and each performance still gives out and has as much to say now as it did in 1943.
The plot is a trifle to be sure. The star Bill Robsinson is sitting on his front porch with some young relatives reminiscing about his career,which is told in extended flashbacks. Each flashback is filled with various musical numbers by his co-stars and/or himself. This continues unabated until the pictures' closing moments.
The producer and director give all acts ample time to showcase their talents throughout and in most cases are given at least two numbers each;in Bill Robsinsons'and Lena Hornes' cases it is multiple numbers. Of course we all know the legend of Bill Robinson,his superior terpsichorean abilities and the inspiration he gave(and still gives)to so many dancers throughout the years,both black and white. Lena Horne was just coming into her own and she is showcased beautifully throughout the film with several numbers to her credit. Each song is sung in her intimitable style along with the famous title song.
Several other acts appear here,some well known others not. The vaudeville team of Miller and Lyles puts in a funny appearance doing their broken down car sketch. The background group of dancers are the Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe. Katherine herself sings and leads the troupe visibly in every number. Legendary Fats Waller drops by to sing a song with famous songstress Ada Brown and one with his band. After witnessing Bill deck a rival for Lena's hand,Fats utters his famous line""One never knows do one"".It's a delight. Cab Calloway is on hand to lend some ""jumpin' jive'"" to the proceedings in his patented zoot suit and his band is definitely hot. Near the end of the film come the dancers with no peer The Nicholus Brothers. And as usual they absolutely astound with their acrobatics on the dance floor. A phenomenon and a force of nature;when they're on they literally stop the picture. Throughout the film Dooley Wilson, fresh off  his high profile appearance singing ""As Time Goes By"" in Casablanca,is on hand as Bill Robsinsons' old friend.
Technically the print used in this transfer does have its' flaws and in some spots more than others and could have used a bit better clean up. But all in all it's more than adequate.
Included with this is an audio commentary and two things you are not told about elsewhere. First is a folded insert by tv writer Sylvia Stoddard on the film and four 5""X7"" repro lobby cards,a nice touch.
In concluding this is a film that will appeal to many,many different people on several differents levels. If you are a dancing fan you will love Katherine Dunham and her troupe along with the Nicholas Brothers and its star Bill Robinson. If you like good music there is Lena Horne,Cab Calloway,Ada Brown and Fats Waller. If you like musicals this has everything you could ever want.""Stormy Weather"" is 77 minutes of pure dynamite and a lasting testament to the talent involved.

Cab Calloway was always VERY entertaining with his band; you can't help but to tap your foot to the beat of his band when he performs.

364151,5,6301798058,"I first saw ""Stormy Weather"" in the early 70's in a weekly program of ""Race Movies"". I used to get my kids on weekends back then and I took them to lots of events like this.

The film is loaded with great music and dancing and manages to hang a slim plot in there somewhere. Don't watch it for the story, just the music. There is music from Lena Horne, Cab Callaway and the great Fats Waller, and possibly the greatest dance performance ever filmed. I had never seen an early Lena Horne film and when she first came on screen I almost hyperventilated. ""Extraordinary beauty"" falls very short of what I saw. Whew! She delivers a fine rendition of ""Stormy Weather""

Fats Waller co-king of stride piano along with the venerable James P Johnson, just tears up the screen. He was one of the truly great performers of the 20th century. I just sit in awe whenever I get to see him on film. Cab Calloway seemed to have more energy than the rest of his band and everyone in the room. Harnessing his energy might have lit an entire city. His band really puts out the sound.

The biggest treat of the film comes when the Nicholas Brothers do a dance performance that is simply unbelievable. And when you think it might be over it just keeps going. They were light on their feet and beautifully physical. It was as if each brother possessed the talent of both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. At the end of the routine there was a lot of spontaneous applause, something I had never witnessed in a theater.

Fayard and Harold Nicholas appeared in many ""Race Films"" and finally made it to the ""big Screen"" in a Gene Kelly film, ""The Pirate"". They were good, but deferred to Kelly. They were not going to get a shot at the mainstream because the movie industry already had its' stars and knew the brothers might well show them up. They went to Europe for many years, where the public flocked to see them. I think they returned to the States because of Harold's health problems.

The dedication of the National WWII Memorial in April, 2004 included a WWII reunion. People who had proudly served the USA came by the thousands. That also included USO performers. As you might suspect, blacks entertained only blacks and whites only whites. At the entertainment stage there were many USO films, which often included the Nicholas Brothers. AS I was watching, a Smithsonian escort was helping a small black man to a seat and somehow I recognized him as Fayard Nicholas. I went over and chatted with him for a while. It was one of the great moments in my life. I can now point to my right hand and say, ""Shook hands with both Fayard Nicholas and Ted Williams""(note the order).

364171,2,6301798058,"Let's be frank: This is a terrible movie.  Racial stereotypes, as one might expect from 1943, abound, and they are demeaning to say the least. The plot is so weak it barely exists.  The acting is dreadful.  The choreography is lousy. And the heart of the love story is between a 65 year old man and a 25 year old woman.  As for Robinson's dancing, well, the Nicholas Brothers are the stars in this regard.  And what exactly were Cab Calloway's talents?  There is a positive side to the movie: It is Lena Horne.  She's a delight, and there are three standard songs in this film.  Horne deserved better, and in time her great talents would be recognized.  Stormy Weather should be seen in its historical context: Blacks were needed in the war effort, and this was a very rare nod to some of their entertainers by a major studio.",1191801600,,826,4.453333333333333

The negatives include the generous display of stereotypes, the poor screenplay, unimaginative direction and non-existent acting (everyone ""smiles"" their role which given the absurd dialogue, may have been the only solution).

What really makes this DVD special beyond the acts themselves and the excellent print is that it contains a superb low key commentary which explains the context of the performers and the roots of their performances - an invaluable history lesson. By the way, was Lena Horne at her peak the sexiest woman alive?  Wow.",1189987200,2,802,5.2421875
364173,5,6301798058,"Yeah, there's not much to the plot. But who needs that when you have that era's largest array of the dimensions of Black talent on film?

To deal with some controversy head-on-the Blackface scene that only one reviewer alluded to. These were oldschool comedians Johnny Lee (Calhoun from Amos & Andy) and veteran comic Flournoy Miller (who appeared in the legendary ""Shuffle Along"" in 1922 and wrote for A&A) doing a classic old black comedy routine called ""Indefinite talk."" People today don't know that in those days, Black comedians in Blackface appearing in Black theaters was as common as profanity is today (which is why I often say that profanity is the blackface of the millennium). So view it in that context.

We even get a rare (if unbilled) look at Stump and stumpy, the comedy team that was said to have inspired Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. They're the ones clowing with Bojangles during the boat scene.

Speaking of Bojangles, his dancing is somewhat reserved compared to his earlier films (he was in his sixtes at the time). Lena Horne is as pretty and classy as ever, but her songs are a tad dragging by modern standards. (BTW-I met Lena's daughter Gail a few years back. She told me that Lena could not stand working with the gun-toting Bojangles).

Fats Waller is also restrained here, but quite funny in his few scenes. However, Cab Calloway is at full throttle at his prime, Hidehoing and dancing away-ALMOST stealing the show (we'll get to who does that in a minute). The ""Jumping Jive"" is much fun. The Katherine Dunham dancers was probably the classiest black dance act of its era, so this folk art was quite rare for films of that time.

NOW ON TO THE NICHOLAS BROTHERS-as everyone knows, this is the highlight of the film (and perhaps their career). The legandary stair dance scene makes me ache as a man to watch it-watch these hard splits and you'll see what I mean!

SIDENOTE-This is loosely based on some real people. Only hardcore jazz and black history fans know that there WAS a Jim Europe who led the 15 Infantry Jazz Band in World War I that the first part of this film is based on.

With that said, watch this and enjoy a full dimension of the era's black talent. The zoot suit scene at the end is a hoot!",1186617600,3,2240,4.571072319201995
364174,5,6301798058,"Stormy Weather gives us magical performance after magical performance after magical performance. The plot may be loosely based on the life of Bill Robinson; but the plot nevertheless remains rather thin--you watch this movie for the more than twenty musical song and dance numbers it contains. We see some of the greatest performances on film by Fats Waller, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, Bill Robinson, Dooley Wilson and the Nicholas Brothers. WOW!

The story begins when Bill Williamson (Bill Robinson) tells his life story in flashback to a group of children on the front porch of his home. Bill starts his story when he and his friends were much younger soldiers just back from World War I service overseas. Immediately Bill falls for Selina Rogers (Lena Horne) and although Selena likes Bill she certainly doesn't want to settle down. We also meet Bill's fast-talking friend Gabe, so ably played by Dooley Wilson.

Selina continues in New York City show business as Bill goes down to New Orleans where he works in a club on Beale Street. It is in this club that we get such special moments: Fats Waller performs ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" and Ada Brown sings beautifully, too. Just by chance in walks Selina with her manager Chick Bailey (Emmett 'Babe' Wallace) and Selina convinces Chick to give Bill a part in their show opening in Chicago. Well, Bill gets the job all right--but it doesn't exactly last.

The story moves along, telling how Bill and Selina go their different ways in show business. The remarkably thin plot, even for a 1940s Hollywood musical, gives the producers of this movie just enough reason to showcase incredible, stunning performances by Cab Calloway and his band. We also get Lena Horne singing ""Stormy Weather;"" and the Nicholas Brothers dance up a storm with a dance number the likes of which I simply never saw before in my life. Lena also sings ""I Can't Give You Anything But Love"" and we get so much more, too.

Of course, the ending is somewhat predictable. However, even the happy ending is subordinate to the way they deliver the happy ending. There is so much levity with Cab Calloway, Bill Robinson and Lena Horne that you just couldn't be blue watching THIS ending!

The stunning choreography never stops nor do the dancers ever miss a beat. The cinematography works wonders in the numerous scenes in which dozens of dancers on the stage are all pictured in one screen. Excellent!

Stormy Weather was filmed in glorious black and white. I think it enhances the artistic quality of this motion picture.

The main DVD extra is an optional audio commentary by Dr. Todd Boyd, Professor of Critical Studies at USC. You get a couple of previews for other films on DVD as well.

Stormy Weather remains one of the greatest musicals of the entire twentieth century. No matter how many times I watch this film something new always pops out at me that I never noticed before. I could watch the Nicholas Brothers dance a million times over and never be bored. Moreover, Bill Robinson and Lena Horne turn in flawless performances.

I highly recommend this film for fans of classic musicals from Hollywood's golden era; and people who are fond of African American cinema will be delighted with this masterpiece.

364176,5,6301798058,"I use this movie as a teaching tool in dance classes in public schools. It shows the roots of every dance form we practice today and proves the point that there is no such thing as a truly ""American"" form of dance. Tap and hip hop originated from African dance/drumming and how it was used in communication from one plantation to another to help one another escape. Katherine Dunham combined AFrican and CAribeean techniques to create well excuted and smart jazz and modern choreogrpahy. Calloway showed us he is the grandfather of hip hop vernacular, Lena Horne the queeen of style, Bill Robinson, a master craftsman and Fats Waller and Ada Brown true talents that were grown out of singing in churches and learning songs passed down from generation to generation. NO one surpasses the Nicholas Brothers in grace and style, and Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly openly admitted they were greatly influenced by them. Please note that there are other small appearances by Noble Sissle and other trailblazers in the film. If you are student and watching the film, notice the first dance scene about the cake walk  - look it up and learn about its history. To me, this movie proves we are all one.

The Nicholas Brothers were known as a ""specialty dance act"" during their time - they were supremely athletic and did things no one else attempted, but the knock on them was that they were not as sophisticated and graceful as other top dancers. Of course, their act must be considered in the context of their times. The chances of them getting a lot of work by doing what all the other dancers did, even if they were able to do it better, were slim indeed. So they did things no else did, thereby ensuring that no white performers could replace them. Regardless, look at them go in this movie, and then tell me that they didn't belong in the top tier of dancers. Man, they are just incandescent!",1149638400,5,906,4.496969696969697

We see Cab Calloway in his prime, younger audiences catching up with him years later in ""The Blues Brothers"". The dancing by the original ""Mr Bojangles"", the Nicholas Brothers and the renowned Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe is beathtaking. Lena Horne is beautiful and her gowns accentuate her beauty.

364207,4,6301798058,"When STORMY WEATHER was re-released in a new DVD format, I had to add it to my collection. I had never seen the complete film before, only the well known excerpts such as the closing scene where the Nicholas Brothers tap their hearts away and Lena Horne singing her famous ballad ""Stormy Weather"" from which the film gets its title.

The plot of the film is not all that strikingly different from other Hollywood musicals of the time. It has a straightforward story, loosely based on the story of Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson. The film begins as Robinson returns home a hero from World War I and longs to get into show business. He is in love with his buddy's sister played by the young Lena Horne. Like all Hollywood musicals, the two are destined for each other, go their separate ways, but eventually are reunited. The film is also like other musicals of the era. It is set in 1943 so patriotic fervor is great and there is no hint of the racial tensions or the great divide between white and black that was so true at the time. Viewers in 2006 will wince at some of the blatant stereotypes and caricatures in the film, but it was a daring film for the time.

Though the story may be contrived, for musical lovers this is not a problem. Not thinking too much about the story gives the viewer more time to enjoy the stuff that makes the film great-the phenomenal musical numbers. ""Stormy Weather"" is but one of the great numbers. We also have Cab Calloway singing ""Geechy Joe"" Fats Waller performing ""Ain't Misbehavin"" and Ada Brown singing ""That Ain't Right"" just to name a few great scenes.

For the musical numbers alone, STORMY WEATHER belongs with the great Hollywood musicals, but one can only wonder.

Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, the Nicholas Brothers, etc.  Everybody's at the top of their game in full knowledge that the opportunity to strut their stuff in a major Hollywood production wouldn't be afforded very often.

364210,5,6301798058,"This delightful film is like a revue of song and dance numbers, held together by a thin plot, which is there simply as a frame for the wonderful music and fabulous talent, notably of Lena Horne, Fats Waller, Cab Calloway, and the protagonist who has the most screen time, Bill Robinson.

Among the others that are remarkable are The Nicholas Brothers and Ada Brown. There are several styles of music represented, from blues, the sultry ballads sung by Lena Horne, to scat singing and big band dance numbers. There's a priceless comedy routine where two men finish each other's sentences, and another treat is to see Katherine Dunham dance in two pieces along with her troupe; she was very popular decades ago, but sadly, not many remember her now.

The dances are staged by Clarence Robinson, and they are numerous, some corny, but all entertaining. Of the singers, Lena Horne is extraordinary. She could make a lame line of dialog sound convincing, make any song worth listening to with her mellow, lovely voice, dance with the best of them, and her sensual beauty has rarely been equaled. The songs she sings are:

""There's No Two Ways About Love, Baby""

""Digga Digga Doo""

""I Can't Give You Anything But Love""

""Stormy Weather"".

The legendary Fats Waller sings his ""Ain't Misbehavin'"", and other songs include ""Rhythm Cocktail"", ""That Ain't Right"", and ""Rang Tang Tang"".

Directed by Andrew Stone, it has marvelous cinematography Leon Shamroy, and though not great in every aspect, it's a historical film that showcases the fantastic black talent of the mid 20th century, and as such it gets my highest rating.

This is an old Black and White, originally copyrighted in 1943, copyright renewed in 1971 by Twentieth Century Fox from a screenplay by Frederick Jackson and Ted Koehler.

Lena Horne was young and beautiful, playing a singing star who met a soldier returning from the First World War (Robinson), and they fell in love, but she doesn't want to give up her singing career to get married and settle down.  They go their own ways. The story continues through the beginning of the Second World War, when they finally finalize their dreams.

No one ever sang Stormy Weather like Lena Horne.

This film is great for the music and dancing, and because of the energy the cast puts into it.  It is an out-and-out musical, with an all black cast.  Fine entertainment.  If the film were made today political correctness would prevent some of the language, because of ""ebonics"" rather than epithets or bad language, and the minstrel scenes with colored people using blackface in their acts would never be tolerated today, although they, too, were innocent.

Too bad we've gone so far that we've lost our sense of humor in our attempt to placate the super-sensitivity of a few.

Lena Horne has to be one of the great singers of the last century.

The all-black cast delivers an incredible number of great numbers: highlights include Cab Callaway's terrific orchestral jive, the amazing Nicholas Brothers, and of course the title song in a remarkable ballet dream sequence.

Because movies of the 1940's featuring black artists playing actual characters and not specialty acts were still a rarity (America was still a segregated nation at the time, and southern theatres regularly omitted black performers from their screens), this production has found a kind of mythological status over the years- even though it is more review than story. Wonderful- brilliant- as Bill Robinson is, it's a little unnerving to see him cast as Lena Horne's love interest when there is a forty-five year age difference between them. But his performance still dazzles, especially his mind-boggling tap dance on an orchestra of bongo drums. The aforementioned songs from Calloway, Waller, Ada Brown, and so on- not to mention Horne's electrifying title number- are all marvelous. And the 'zoot-suit' finale with Calloway and the elegant Nicholas Brothers- in death-defying leaps and splits down a gleaming white spiral staircase- is the stuff musical dreams are made of.",1037923200,10,1023,5.2439024390243905

As a story, it is pretty slim stuff... but as a collection of musical turns by some of the early 1940s best black talent, it simply can't be beat.
Robinson was, of course, one of the truly great dancers of his era.  Made late in his career, this film doesn't really manage to capture the scope of his talents, but he remains a constant joy to watch.  A very young and remarkably beautiful Lena Horne also offers several enjoyable songs, including one that she would go on to perform with increasing sophistocation and ultimately make entirely her own: the title tune ""Stormy Weather.""  In addition to Calloway and Horne, STORMY WEATHER offers great performances by such under-filmed artists as Cab Calloway, Katherine Dunham, Fats Waller (performing his signature tune, ""Ain't Misbehaving""), the brillant Nicholas Brothers, and Ada Brown, as well as the popular comic actor Dooley  Wilson.
