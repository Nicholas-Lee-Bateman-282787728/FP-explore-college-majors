8162328,1,B000LMPLPG,"Fans of Cynthia Khan who are searching for a great martial arts movie showcasing her at her best will be deeply disappointed with what constitutes an inept director's attempt to make a martial arts movie that features poorly choreographed martail arts action. Furthermore, this doesn't really qualify as a martial arts flick because there is very little real action. Stay away at all cost.",1378857600,,389,5.09375
8162329,2,B000LMPLPG,"This looks like a poor copy from VHS. Brightness and contrast vary greatly. Subtitles are often white on white, making the plot hard to follow for a non-Chinese speaker - most irritating. There are no set-up options.",1288396800,,216,4.864864864864865

Sweetheart Moon Lee plays a psychotic police inspector who gets jealous of her best friend Cynthia Khan because she is going to get married to Moon's secret lover.
Moon Lee completly gets out of control as she kills that guy and acuse her friend of the murder...

A very hard to find flick finally turns up on a DVD released by Tai Seng.
But unfortunately Tai Seng didn't put a lot of effort into this release and just put in on a DVD-R like a lot of other movies of lesser quality. The source print must have been either a VHS or a VCD because the quality is not DVD-worthy.

I was looking for this film many years and I was very happy to finally find it here on DVD but I was a very dissapointed by that low quality. Sure its watchable but the price is too much for a ""self made"" DVD.

A final word to Tai Seng:I can also copy VHS or VCD's myself on a DVD-R,I don't need to buy them !!
Battling babe flicks have a very large cult following,so releasing these films in a proper quality will also guarantee high sales,this release is, altough a good film,definitively not the way to do it !!",1224288000,9,1199,4.273127753303965
