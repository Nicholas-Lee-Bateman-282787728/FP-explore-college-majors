2687999,3,B000KB48DO,"Okay, April Monique Burril is hot in her special, I'm a trendy goth kind of way.  She's good in the movie.

Gunner Hanson and Hershell Gordon Lewis aren't in the film for collectively more than three minutes, which is disappointing. They're not a real reason to see the movie.

The gore is spread thin, yes.  I did like the mentality of the film; it really tried to satisfy the gorehound's out there, but the budget restrained it.

What is good about this movie is the weird characters, especially Sally and her roommate.

This is probably a rental, though I'll say it's been one of the better movies on the Shock-O-Rama label lately.",1174089600,10,634,4.616071428571429

2688001,1,B000KB48DO,"I'm sorry, but this is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.

I purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be. In reality, it's nearly everything that's WRONG with low-budget films.

First off, the camera work is horrible. Secondly, I've seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays. I mean, these actors make Keanu Reeves look like Denzel Washington. And finally, the story was absolutely horribly done. I admit, the premise itself had some promise--But the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor I might have had.

Plain and simply, this film was unwatchable. I turned it off 65% through it. And I would've turned it off earlier but I was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen.

If you care at all about quality, in any sense, DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PIECE OF TRASH!",1173830400,5,910,4.777070063694268
2688002,5,B000KB48DO,"Long has Hollywood been trying to create a cult classic film, ever since the 1950s, when Hollywood last produced their great low-budget classics.  Hollywood has tried many times to create a cult classic horror film.  Their most recent attempt was in Snakes on a Plane, which was disappointing at best.  Big name stars simply don't appear in Cult Classics.  Additionally, Cult Classics aren't made for the sake of being Cult Classics.  A true Cult classic is made by an independent filmmaker, pouring his/her life and soul into a film, and creating a masterpiece, with a negligible budget, and a passion for filmmaking.  It is this special recipe that we find in Chainsaw Sally.

Chainsaw Sally is truly a cult classic, even being a new release.  Writer/Director Jimmy-O Burril has truly created a masterpiece of fine cinema, in his quirky tale of our heroine, Chainsaw Sally.  Mild-mannered Librarian by day, and psychopathic chainsaw killer by night.  This film is a tale that will last for generations.

While it doesn't have the special effects eye-candy that mainstream horror films have, it still has a generous dose of gore, very well done, without all the CG that is common in large budget films.  The story carries the film far more than any effects do.

I had the pleasure of seeing this film about six months before the official release, and was highly impressed.  I've always been one to enjoy low-budget horror films, but this one struck me as being completely unique, among all of the films I've seen.

Jimmy-O has written and directed a masterful film, filled with incredibly talented unknown actors (not to mention cameos by Gunnar Hansen - Leatherface himself - and Herschell Gordon Lewis - iconic classic horror filmmaker) that will delight and horrify audiences the world over.

In the horror film community, this film has generated a lot of buzz and interest in the two years between the film's completion and release.  This film is a must-see for any horror fan, and likely to be enjoyable by dark comedy fans as well.

This is definitely a Must-See!",1172707200,7,2070,4.899425287356322
2688003,5,B000KB48DO,"Meet Sally, quiet, mild-mannered librarian of the Porterville library, she lives with her extremely strange cross-dressing brother Ruby. Likes quiet nights in front of the tube watching the latest horror marathon, fudgesicles and small but deadly chainsaws. Dislikes greedy land developers, loudmouth miscreants who can't keep quiet in the library, misogynistic pool-playing chumps, and people who have problems spelling ""malt."" Watch Sally and Ruby cut a path to greatness, all the while showing their small community the meaning of ""family values.""

Chainsaw Sally has a fairly standard plot line; brother and sister watch mom and dad get brutally murdered by maniacs (but not before Dad (played by Leatherface himself, Gunnar Hansen) exacts his vengeance and tells Sally to take care of the family). Add in a greedy scumbag land developer looking to raze the land and develop condo's where Sally and Ruby's home rests. Sounds like your run-of-the-mill horror plot? Wrong!

What sets Chainsaw Sally apart from many other indie horror flicks is that sure she's a cold-blooded killer, but this is a movie where the killer is the hero of the story, and I don't know how else to put it, but Sally is dare I say, almost adorable when she's laying the chainsaw smackdown on her well deserving victims. She's just so damn likeable!

The gore runs regularly and is pretty well done, I doubt you will ever be at a loss or think, ""you know, this movie could have had a bit more gore."" I enjoyed some of the kills more than others because given the title I expected to see only gritty chainsaw action, but I was wickedly surprised. Sally can do the Leatherface shuffle like no one else, other than the master Gunnar Hansen, you can tell she possesses the genes to swing a Stihl in true TCM style.

The acting was just a bit tedious at times, but I never thought so of most of the main characters, and in one scene the blood was a bit too watery and clear which worried me, but I was reassured in the next death sequence and let's just say I don't think I'll ever look at sparklers in quite the same way.

I also enjoyed the rockabilly and at times L7 like soundtrack that I think really added to the flick and gave the scenes just a bit more attitude.",1171670400,10,2242,4.680203045685279
2688004,5,B000KB48DO,"chainsaw Sally is a great little low budget movie that cleverly avoids all the typical pitfalls of modern low budget flicks.

There isn't much blood in the movie, but I even gore hounds are treated with enough blood to keep them interested.

April does a magnificent portrayal as Sally, and JimmyO directs the movie with a secure hand.

Overly a great little movie that you shouldn't pass up on!",1169164800,9,395,4.695652173913044
2688005,5,B000KB48DO,"As one of the honoured few who have seen this prior to release I have to tell you that you're in for a treat.

Sickness and depravity reign supreme as you watch a mild mannered library assistant gone rabid in a small town. WITH A CHAINSAW!

'Sally' takes schlock to an all new level with Burill giving us reason to believe the heart of horror is alive and well.

Theres some slang in there you might not get first time round, (I'm british), but you'll be more than happy to watch it again.

The effects were very well done and in all I appreciated having something new to watch.

I wouldn't be surprised to see this become one of the biggest indie film releases of the year.

Support new horror! Get your hands on Chainsaw Sally, she bites, but you'll love her anyway.

2688015,2,B000KB48DO,"I saw this flick advertised in Fangoria.
First thought that occured to me was,
""A hot, freaky chick with a chainsaw, this movie has gotta be sick.""
2 hours and 1 lesson later, I was swallowing those thoughts.
It goes to show ya, you can't judge any-dang-thing by it's cover.

Now it's time for a List of Everything that is Wrong with this Movie:
- Pornographic Lighting
(The minute you turn it on, you'll think you're watching a porno)

- Pornographic Acting
(Any minute you'll expect people to start taking their clothes off)

- Unbelievable Characters
(These are not people you know, or can even associate with)

- A Long-winded, Go-nowhere, Story
(You'd think there would be alot of action and gore to drive the story along, but it just never happens)

- Almost no blood and gore what-so-ever
(Spraying red corn syrup at a wall is in no way horrific)

- Terrible Sound Effects
(A chainsaw should sound like a monster with a voracious appetite, not like a kitten with an attitude problem)

- Local-Band Soundtrack
(Does nothing for the movie itself, sets no mood, invokes no tension)

With all that being said, this movie has almost no redeeming value.
Gunnar Hansen gives a disappointing performance,
something akin to a ""loony toons"" death.
Hershel Gordon Lewis's performance was the only breath of fresh air in the entire movie.
Which is pretty sad considering he isn't even an actor.

All in all;
I guess you could file this movie under the ""so bad, it's good"" sub-genre.
But it marginally qualifies even as that.
Horror patrons will label this as an instant classic.
Fans with a keener eye though, will instantly zero in on this flicks incompetence.

8155453,1,B000KB48DO,"Chainsaw Sally (Jimmyo Burril, 2004)

Man, I should have loved this movie. I should have loved everything about it.  I mean, come on--it's a SEXY LIBRARIAN SERIAL KILLER MOVIE. This is one of those concepts that's so ridiculously amazing that I can't believe no one thought of it before this. And yet, as far as I can tell, Chainsaw Sally is the first, and only, sexy librarian serial killer movie. What a terrible, terrible thing that is; someone could really make a good one, if they set their mind to it, came up with a killer script, and cast the right folks. All things that Jimmyo Burril seems to have overlooked in this attempt.

Plot: do you need a plot? Sally (April Monique Burril) is a quiet, timid, bespectacled... oh, stereotypical... librarian with a secret: she's severely emotionally damaged, thanks to witnessing the brutal murders of her parents. And in lieu of therapy, she's come up with an alternative means of treatment:  attempting to track down the murderers and introduce them to her chainsaw-themed brand of justice. Meanwhile, she's taken it upon herself to raise her younger brother, who if anything is even more messed up than she is...

The movie has any number of problems that keep it from being watchable, most of the big ones mentioned in the first paragraph, but the movie's biggest shortcoming is that Burril never seems quite sure whether he wants to play the movie straight or for laughs. The compromise is that he switches between the two on a frequent basis. When done correctly, and on a much more limited basis, this can work (The Evil Dead being the classic example), but it's far too frequent here to have (what I assume is) the intended effect, leaving us with heads spinning, and not in the good way. While it's developed something of a cult following, this is one you can safely give a miss. *",1367452800,,1840,4.701863354037267
