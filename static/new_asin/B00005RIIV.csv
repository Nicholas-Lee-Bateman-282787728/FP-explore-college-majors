7952303,5,B00005RIIV,"I have ordered this tape because I have seen the show on the National Geogrphic Channel and was very impressed with the bravery displayed and insight gained by both journalists into Massoud's struggle.

As a result I have been very impressed with Massoud's achievements, his nature and charisma and have been deeply sadend by his murder. One of the unparalleled individuals in history.

So if you want to learn more about Ahmad Shah Massoud and the historical run-up to his struggle, this documentary is very good.",1116806400,3,514,4.965116279069767
7952304,3,B00005RIIV,"If you are looking for a National Geographic Special about the people, land or culture of Afghanistan...this ISN'T it. Instead, this is an interesting take on the endless war of Afghanistan, and the ultimate martyrdom of a great leader, Ahmed Shah Massou, the 'Lion of Panjshir'.",1108512000,4,279,5.086956521739131
7952305,3,B00005RIIV,"Before I begin, I want it to make it clear that there is some value in this video and, in spite of the shortcomings, it isn't worthless. It has a great deal of value in some ways, which I will outline at the end of the review.

First, I found that this movie didn't do justice to the richenss of the history of Afghanistan. It very briefly covered some of the history, but it seemed to be just rushing that part so that it could spend as much time as possible to cover Massoud and the Northern Alliance vs. Taliban struggles. For a movie supposedly ""revealing"" an country with a rich history, you'd think the ancient history would have been covered a little more thoroughly. Sure, there are time constraints, but at least a better effort could have been put forth.

Second, the little bits of history covered seemed to be covered in a very frail and almost deceiving way. For example, the video strongly emphasized Massoud's role in the mujahideen that liberated Afghanistan from the Russians, but failed to mention that Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban were also part of this movement. One wonders why they it wasn't even mentioned that the civil war between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance happened when those two groups competed for power from within the mujahideen. One almost could have gotten the impression from the movie that the Northern Alliance alone was essentially the mujahideen. Every documentary video clip of Afghanistan war history, even 10 second ones, seem to mention that Osama was part of the mujahideen, so I fail to realise why this drawn out documentary wouldn't even mention this?

Third, I found that the video should probably have given more information about the Taliban itself. It gave some details, but they were rather sketchy. Where did they orignate from? Who were their leaders? Etc.

This movie was still somewhat interesting, and I would recommend it if you are seeking a documentary on the recent civil war, the humanitarian crisis, and the activities of Massoud. However, if you are looking for something more general, something that will give you a rich understanding and appreciation of Afghanistan and the wars it fought, go elsewhere. I'm sure you can find a better  information-centric documentary overview of the current civil war, too.",1104796800,3,2286,4.866323907455013
7952306,5,B00005RIIV,"I strongly recommend this video to anyone that would like to learn about what was going on in Afghanistan prior to September 11th. Author Sebastian Junger & the famous photographer Reza are both in this film.  We are introduced to Ahmed Shah Massoud-Afghanistan's last hope, who was mortally wounded a few days before America was attacked by the terrorists.  Mr. Massoud tried to warn the world of what was to come, but no one cared to listen.  I was deeply moved by this
documentary.",1030406400,13,484,4.738095238095238
