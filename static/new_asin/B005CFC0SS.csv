If you want to take the cheaper way out, YouTube offers most all the Degrassi series for free views.",1494288000,,210,4.275
8465269,1,B005CFC0SS,Didn't have all the episodes it is missing the last 8 of them. Waste of money and total scam. Don't buy this!,1474243200,,109,4.0
8465270,5,B005CFC0SS,"I started watching degrassi on teen nick around 2008, I know late bloomer. I grew to really love this show thanks to a few friends who were talking about it at school I decided to give it a chance. I bought season 10 part 1 on black Friday last year and I really wanted the second part so of course I googled it and it sent me to amazon. Now I can watch all of season 10 without commercials, and anytime I want. This is the first tv series I decided to buy and it hasn't disappointed me yet and I don't see it disappointing me in the future. I will recommend this to my friends specially the ones that got me interested in the show to begin with.",1369872000,,646,4.015503875968992

8465272,5,B005CFC0SS,"I bought this 2 weeks ago for my daughter and she loves it ,but i would have rather bought the full season pack for 17.98 then buying the 2 disc sets separtely which adds up for total of 21.93. Just money saving tips.",1341792000,,217,4.069767441860465
8465273,5,B005CFC0SS,"This DVD came came just how I expected it to be.  It holds the second half to season 10 of Degrassi.  One benefit that the other half of the season did not have is that there are more episodes per disc (2 discs total).  I really like that because I don't have to worry about smudging the discs since I don't have to flip them over, like I did for Season 10 part 1.

If you are a degrassi fan, this product is for you!",1335398400,,417,3.8705882352941177
8465274,5,B005CFC0SS,"Again, I received this item but it is a christmas gift.  It is in excellent condition and I'm sure my daughter will enjoy watching it.",1319673600,,134,4.36
8465275,5,B005CFC0SS,"This a really good dvd, I enjoyed it thoroughly. the setting out for it is really easy to understand and there are great extra features attached to the product as well.",1318377600,,168,4.451612903225806
8465276,2,B005CFC0SS,This was ok but it didn't have the features I wanted! Was hoping to see deleted scenes or un aired cast interviews! Waste of money!,1318291200,,131,4.28
8465277,3,B005CFC0SS,"I love Degrassi and am at an age where I probably shouldn't, but it is such an addiction that I can't be rehabbed of. I own every season of this show and continue with it, having gone back to the 80's original show that my sister used to watch and wishing that the new series would once again re-incorporate those old characters into the new show. My own show suggestions aside, the Degrassi: TNG home video releases have gone from great (Seasons 1-6), to moderately okay (7-9), to downright rubbish (Season 10 Part 1). I don't know why we get the cheap dual disc format here in America, but for some reason Epitome Pictures or the rubbish company Echo Bridge thinks that consumers prefer this. Not me! I had to order my season 10 from Canada because unlike America they have the actual 4-disc box set that I prefer, rather than having to delicately handle some dual disc release from the States. As it would appear that this release of Part 2 looks to be of the same format, I am left with no other choice than to spend a few extra $$ on yet another Canadian release as well as possible from here forth if this continues to be their distribution process, stateside. Don't wast your money here if you prefer a semi-better quality (hey, they still aren't Blu-Ray, but who cares) much the way I do.",1314144000,7,1296,4.449579831932773
