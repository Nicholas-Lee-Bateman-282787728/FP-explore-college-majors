8247488,5,B0012RD3ZE,"It's been a while I wrote any reviews and what better way to begin than reviewing an anime series I have been watching from the very beginning, Kanon.  This volume continues from the last DVD, where it left off from the school dance and Mai is facing trouble from the student council as they are trying to expel her from school for the damages caused at the dance.  She escapes being expelled and is given one last warning as another incident will not be overlooked.  Yuicihi is very concerned about Mai and decides to take up training in order to help her fight against the spirits that dwell within the school.  Mai and Yuichi are working together and through this event, Yuichi finally learns something important about his past and his ties with Mai.  The arc ends in this DVD and the only thing you know for sure is, Mai won't be re-visited in the series for a while and the focus of attention is now shifted towards Shiori, who's mysterious disease is preventing her from going to school.  At the end of the DVD, a shocking news is revealed to Yuichi by Shiori's sister as it turns out that...well, that is for you find out by purchasing the DVD.

Overall, I am well pleased with how the ""Mai Arc"" finished.  So far, the series is very much focused on Yuichi finding out his past, but with the addition of Shiori at the end of the volume, the series is taking a step forward with the developing relationship between Shiori and Yuichi.  Not much information is revealed about Nayuki and Ayu, though there's a sense that these 2 characters have much more to reveal later on.  A great DVD volume for a great series.  Should not be missed by anyone who has been watching from the beginning.  Watch for my review of Volume 5 real soon (I'm almost done watching it)",1212969600,2,1764,4.461059190031152
8247489,5,B0012RD3ZE,"Let me explain that statement. After a while Kanon became about Mai to me. That was and is my favorite character in the series. Ever since the last episode on the first dvd when she was standing there holding that sword I wanted to know what was her deal. The other women well, the uguu girl I kinda want to know what she's looking for, the sick chick who visits the school I don't really care if she dies or not, Makoto the fox girl was mildly entetaing, and the the other girl with the blue hair who lives in the house I don't think she has a story. Mai was the only character with a darkness to her. Her bland I don't care about anything or anyone attitude was cool to me. Unfortunatly her story is done. I will buy the rest of the series but the excitment won't be there for me. Peace",1210982400,2,788,4.090322580645161
8247490,5,B0012RD3ZE,"Volume 4 contains episodes 13-16 and the rockin' end to Mai's part of the story. You can expect more nighttime visits to the school, more secrets from Yuichi's past unveiled, and more Uguu~.

Episode 16 starts Shiori's arc, and answers a a couple of burning questions: What is Shiori's relation to Kaori and What is the nature of her illness?

Like the other volumes, volume 4 is another stunning addition to the series. And like the other volumes, the ending of episode 16 will leave you eagerly awaiting volume 5.",1208563200,6,515,4.711111111111111
