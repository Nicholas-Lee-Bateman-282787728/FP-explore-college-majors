7969783,3,B00006IXD1,"Intrigued to see a film by the director who comes with such accolades from the master Ray...and there are parallels with the Ray's Apu...subject, location, the presence of the train behind the lovers, & family struggle. I enjoyed the film BUT felt it would have improved with editing by about half an hour. That's likely the result of my being conditioned over the years to swifter narrative development. And the camera hanging on the heroine's three-quarter dreamy head became laughable on the third occasion....cliched subsequently, reducing drama to melodrama. There are some wonderful things...photography, singing, plausible characters, particularly the old mother (with some though, the director's hand is felt and too studied). Probably a song or two too many from the aspirant singing brother, but one thrilling lament by a trio of Bauls, almost worth the movie alone.",1433289600,,876,5.355072463768116
7969784,5,B00006IXD1,Ritwik Ghatak was a master filmmaker who unfortunately died much too early. Not as well known in the West as the OTHER great Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray. This is probably his greatest work. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of picture and sound. Loved it - thanks Amazon.,1383004800,,276,4.8936170212765955
