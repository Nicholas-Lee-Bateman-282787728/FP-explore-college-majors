8502187,3,B006OSQNHG,"Watching Disc 1 took me way back to the 50's.  What a wonderful time to live and raise children. We will never get that back again.  The actors, producers, directors are not interested in good quality films.  They like garbage.  Even cable TV has trash movies being shown. One day people will become tired of 'nothing to watch'...........I've said it everyday.  One day I will pull the Cable plug and hit the 'reading of good books' once again.",1466553600,,444,4.641025641025641
8502188,3,B006OSQNHG,"This set is okay! There are no on screen bugs! I hate those. The visual quality of the shows is pretty bad, about how they looked on my black and white TV that I originally saw them on after school. The shows themselves are pretty good! Some good actors. The price was right. The packaging is pointlessly over sized in a stupid embossed tin box, but that is okay too! okay?",1335916800,3,373,4.267605633802817
