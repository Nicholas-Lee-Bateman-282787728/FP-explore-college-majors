8036324,5,B0004Z32UQ,"This is a brilliant piece of cinema. I've watched it numerous times and it always makes me laugh and cry. It's beautifully shot and directed and tells the story of a porn star who has an amazing life, who reconnects with his family after the death of his father, and who eventually gives his heart to a small boy. This is a wonderful movie. I think you will love it as much as I do. Most highly recommended!",1388880000,4,407,4.230769230769231

8036326,5,B0004Z32UQ,"This was actually a very touching story. The movie has subtiles, I think it is an Italian Language Movie. Its about this guy ""Ricardo"" who leaves his family to become a pornstar. But he is not only a pornstar, he is a STAR.  Everyone loves him, he makes great money and he is gorgeous. There is bit of confusion -at least for me -when this lady gets into a car accident and she dies, leaving her son to be raised by his grandparents. Ricardo loves the boy and visa versa and he is allowed to play the ""dad"" role to the child until... well I don't wanna ruin it, but the movie is very touching and I would definately recommend it.  I love it.",1306540800,2,641,4.161290322580645
8036327,5,B0004Z32UQ,"When I initially slipped this French/Italian DVD into the player, I had relatively little foreknowledge what to expect. Sure, the words ""GAY PORN"" conjure up stereotypical conceptions here in North America, but viewing this gem the first time around found me warily adrift in unfamiliar territory. ""ADORED .."" pertains to experiencing serious Euro gay porn DRAMA, and drama it is; serious, unpredictable, gorgeous and heart-rending. Production values shine and the cast is superb; the lead (Marco Filiberti) is a ringer for my last college roommate (how many decades ago was THAT?!) and don't think for a moment that this DOESN'T affect my 5-star rating (even after all these years). I am being unabashedly sentimental with no apologies. ""ADORED .."" touches all the bases and drives the message of love and tolerance forcefully home. ""ADORED .. Diary of a Porn Star"" is a winner by any standard. Trust me. It's not the flick you expect.",1266883200,4,936,5.084415584415584
8036328,1,B0004Z32UQ,"Big disappointment. The previous reviews must have been written by the producers. There is no excitement in this story, and the feeble attempts to make the main character likeable by having him interact with children is lame. He may be a porn star, but not from what is viewed in this conglomeration of a story.",1178928000,11,311,4.672727272727273
8036329,5,B0004Z32UQ,"""Adored"" is a fabulous tale of a gay porn star trying to balance his

""adored,"" and very lucrative, work life with a reintroduction to being

part of a family and wanting a life outside of porn. The story is

touching, flawless, and sexy, with a provocative message about life in the

sex industry combined with family, love, and timely desires.

Riki is seemingly happy with his life. He is extremely attractive and

lives in a gorgeous apartment in Rome. He lives a life removed from his

family, and has sex for a living. Everything seems perfect to him. Then,

when he has to go home to deal with his father's death and the

subsequential estate money, his simple life away from home and his family

is put to the test. Riki's brother, Federico, a more conservative and

straight man, decides to return to Rome with his brother, and has no idea

what he is in for. He has no idea what his brother does for a living, and

when he finally figures it out, he is blown out of the water. Soon enough,

however, the brothers open lines of communication and begin developing a

remarkable relationship neither saw coming. Then, when an adorable,

charming, smart, open-minded orphan child comes into the picture, both

brothers find themselves craving a family they never thought they'd have.

""Adored,"" while showing a brilliant and sex-positive glimpse into the gay

porn world, is about far more than just sex and money. It is a beautiful

and fascinating story about family and love, and about stepping outside of

your comfort zone and opening your eyes to new ideas. It's an astounding

film with excellent acting, phenomenal character development, some sexy

scenes, and ultimately, a clinching story that will, no doubt, resonate. A

must-see.",1132185600,10,1748,4.808080808080808
8036330,5,B0004Z32UQ,"ADORED (or ""Poco piu di un anno fa"") is a superb film that smacks of brilliance on every level. The fact that this is the writing, directing AND acting debut of Marco Filiberti should alert the cinema world that a major talent has arrived. This is a film about a very lovable young man who just happens to be a gay porn star and how that choice of career affects his life, his family, his philosophy, and his impact on all those around him.

The film opens with some odd commentators who we find are being utilized for a documentary in the year 2014 on the life of Riki 'Kandinsky' (Marco Filiberti). The men making the film are steered by one 'Pietro'. We discover that Riki Soldani was born in France to a wealthy, stuffy family, but fled to Rome when his mother died, leaving his brother Federico (Urbano Barberini) and his father behind. In Rome Riki Soldani becomes Riki Kandinsky, the most sought after male porn star in Italy, lusted after for his muscular good looks, his infamously grand sexual equipment, and his scintillating sexuality. Riki is not a hustler, though he does frequent bars and bathhouses for his gratification. His friends include a fellow porn star Claudio (Claudio Vanni) and a loopy female named Luna ((Rosalinda Celentano). He lives in a splendid home, is obviously making a lot of money, and yet he is not partnered: Riki believes relationships, even with men, are too transient and are doomed from the start.

We are in the year 2002 and when Riki's father dies, he goes back to France to his home, where his family cannot accept his lifestyle. He returns to Rome, convinced he is alone in the world except for his extended family in the porn industry. Soon Federico follows him to Rome to implore the wealthy Riki to help resolve the fact that their father's death left mountains of debt, the family mansion being the only viable asset. Federico confronts Riki about his 'disgusting life', but to Riki's credit he brings Federico to a point where Federico is not only accepting, but embracing Riki's friends and occupational life!

When Riki observes an auto accident that kills a Lesbian mother, leaving her young son an orphan, Riki is at last touched by a 'fellow-traveler': young 'Plapla' (his real name is Pietro) understands the gay world despite his young years and longs to have Riki as his foster parent, much to the chagrin of his grandparents who barely know this son of a lesbian daughter. Federico assists Riki in his efforts to obtain guardianship, but the attempt is unsuccessful.

The film's conclusion is unpredicted and the life of Riki Kandinsky is the raison d'etre for the documentary we observed at the beginning of the movie. And you must see this magical film for yourself to tie all the threads together!

Though many will find aspects of the film bordering on the surreal or pushing credibility over the edge, Marco Filiberti has produced so much food for thought, tender discussions about acceptance of who we are, our need for connection, and a 'fabulous' look into the gay porn industry, that those who are not moved by this film will be few. The cinematography, costumes, set decor, music, and above all, the acting is all of the very highest caliber.

Filiberti has a unique method of storytelling that gives notice of a true creative mind on his initial venture. Not only is he a fine writer and a very fine director, he is a feast for the eyes and an actor whose magnetism in front of the camera is impossible to ignore. By all means this is a film to see and purchase, as it is one of the 'sleeper giants' of the year. Grady Harp, November 2004",1099353600,27,3612,4.662480376766091
