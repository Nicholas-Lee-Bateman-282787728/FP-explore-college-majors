8520856,4,B007PXYV4Q,"Time of the Wolf is a solid but slow moving film about a boy going through hardship at the death of his mom and having to live with his great aunt and uncle. His aunt and uncle are childless after they lost their own two boys. The aunt is against him living with them at first but her hard shell comes off the more she gets to know Aaron as he reminds her of their own boys.

Burt Reynolds, playing the uncle here seemed miscast as a farmer as the movie began, but you really see him in the role as he fleshes it out and shows great compassion for his nephew and his struggles. His understanding of Aaron's need for release of the pressures through escaping by way of hanging out at the nearby ridge (where Aaron secretly brings his wolf food) and his conversations with his wife about how much Aaron needs that release as much as he needs them for his family are some of Burt's greatest acting moments in his whole career in my opinion.

He has to endure fitting in at a new school where of course, there is the usual bully ready with what bullies do best. There is a satisfying scene where Aaron fights back, but that only fuels the bully fire further as Josh the bully now will do anything to get even with Aaron who gets him suspended as a result of the fight.

Of course it is named Time of the Wolf for the reason of Aaron secretly befriending a wild wolf that's being hunted by the bully and his father. The usual obligatory shots of ducks flying in V formation, the boy-in-peril scene needing rescue and other wildlife shots are there, as are the life lessons for the boy, and a very difficult (and heartbreaking) decision he must make regarding his future. You may have seen all the elements before but Time Of The Wolf is a sizable cut above the usual low budget family film and is worthy of your permanent film collection. 4.5 stars",1405209600,,1843,4.305475504322766

8520858,2,B007PXYV4Q,"I bought this to show to my students. It has too many swear words for me to even finish it. I am sorely disappointed! I bought the DVD in a pack of 8 and this movie said family rated. I would NOT rate it this way, but then maybe ""family"" means different things to different people. It seems like a good movie. My students were enjoying it, but as soon as we started hearing the ""h"" word, the ""a"" word and the ""d"" word I didn't feel good about continuing to show it. I am just so frustrated. Grrr!",1398124800,2,496,4.02020202020202

8520860,4,B007PXYV4Q,"I think this is a good movie for anyone over eight years of age.  It has pretty scenery, and proves how a person and animal can form strong bonds and give support to each other.  The boy in the movie learns a lot of lessons about life (both good and bad).  The boy has determination which helps him in many situations.  Overall, a good older movie and well worth the reasonable price I paid for it through Amazon. I wish they made more good wholesome movies like this movie.",1376265600,5,474,4.292134831460674
