7984891,3,B00008K79E,"""The Last Warrior"" borrows heavily from ""Heaven Knows Mr. Allison"" (1957) and ""Hell in the Pacific"" (1968) to tell the story of a lone American soldier and a novice nun who find themselves in a strategic position in the Pacific during WW 2, and are hunted by Japanese soldiers. It stars Gary Graham and Maria Holvoe with Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa.

Gary Graham is primarily a TV actor who is probably best known as Detective Sikes from the ""Alien Nation"" (1989-90) series.

This was Maria Holvoe's last of 3 films she made. All she's required to do in this film is show fear and occasionally her ample bosoms, which she does adequately. One senses she could do more, but the script doesn't give her a chance.

You may not recognize Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa's name, but you will know his face from over 100 films and TV shows. He's been in films like ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001), ""The Last Emperor"" (1987), and ""Rising Sun"". He's probably best known as Shang Tsung from ""Mortal Combat"" (1995) or as Lt. Shimamura from the ""Nash Bridges"" series.
This was the only film directed by Martin Wragge and the last of 3 that he produced.

The acting by Graham and Holvoe is good, and Tagawa's intensity is the scene stealer. The action is a little slow, as one might expect from a film with only a few characters who wander around a small Pacific Island. Photography is good.

This is certainly a good film, but personally if I want to see an American fight a Japanese in WW 2 I prefer Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune in ""Hell in the Pacific"".",1302220800,2,1517,4.521897810218978

Otherwise it's an unbelievable plot that could have used some direction to try to salvage it.

Rent it, watch Maria Hovoe, and then move on.",1262563200,,216,4.512820512820513
7984894,5,B00008K79E,"I really enjoyed this film, but I spent a lot of my time thinking that it had to be a misrable shoot.  A huge amount of this film was shot in a jungle, a big fight scene was done in knee high water...Well you get the idea.
The two princable actors were wonderful, and did a fantastic job kicking each other's butt through the whole film.  A good gift for a guy.  A lot of fighting, a nice view and of course some gratious female nudity. lol
