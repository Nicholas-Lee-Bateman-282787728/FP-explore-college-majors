7158896,5,B00X5ZSONM,"The X-Men belong in Singers hands. Why did X3 fail so hard? Because Rush Hour and the X-Men are nothing alike. I really hope Fox tries their best to hold on to the franchise. I'd hate to see the serious tone turn in a 'fun time for the family' if they become apart of the ridiculously child friendly MCU. Singer knows how to capture the fond memories of comics in the 90's and transfer them onto the big screen. Much like he did for Superman Returns, apart from all the negative reviews/responses. It was exactly what he set out to make it, a homage to the Reeves' era. Any who, super excited to see the Rogue cut as the only thing that was missing from the theatrical release was more screen time for the future mutants.",1434758400,7,721,4.3088235294117645

7158923,4,B00X5ZSONM,"Best X men since X2. I wish I'd seen it in the theater, but I kind of stopped caring. It's a clever story, and a nice way to pave the way for a series that takes place in the past. But it also actually has heart and isn't too much of a CG mess. It is full of stellar acting, necessary in stories this far-fetched. Singer finally got a chance to fix what was broken in the third X-Men movies and he did pretty much everything I would have wanted him to do. I actually teared up a bit at the end. If you watched the first X-Men series, and like the first two (and especially the second film), I think you're guaranteed to love this one. Extra props to Fassbender and McAvoy who are brilliant in every scene they have together.",1514937600,,724,4.105633802816901
7158924,5,B00X5ZSONM,"X-Men: Days of Future Past is one of the best comic book movies in existence.  It has great action, tension, characterization, a well-crafted and perfectly paced storyline and amazing visuals and scoring.  I was a bit scared for this cut, since I felt it might ruin the film's pacing, but luckily, my fears didn't pan out.  This is the definitive version of the film.  That being said, it is only ever so slightly, so unless you're a completionist or really curious, if you already have the theatrical version of the film, this one is practically unnecessary.

The plot of the film isn't changed, but the extra scenes add some interesting bits of story and characterization that fit the tone of the film and help the movie feel more cohesive.  They also address a couple of minimal plot holes from the original, though sadly they still don't bother to explain stuff that left casual audiences confused, such as Professor Xavier's return after his death in X-Men III (which was addressed elsewhere) and Kitty Pride's new, unexplained consciousness-time-travel powers (which were never addressed).

There are also a couple of new extras that are far more interesting that the ones included in the original version, so that's definitely a plus.  The one thing that puzzles me, though, is the decision to call this extended edition ""The Rogue Cut"".  Yeah, Rogue is there now, but her screen time is absolutely minimal and her role in the film ends up largely unjustified (she's supposed to be there to replace Kitty Pride after she's injured, but the movie never makes it look necessary by, saying, having Kitty die from her injuries at some point later).

So yeah, if you don't already own any version of the movie, this is the one to go, but if you do own the theatrical version it's certainly not a priority.",1514332800,2,1807,4.8

The X-Men movies aren't Fun like MCU, PERFECTLY keeping in conjunction with the comics. They are completely separate vibes and I hope it stays that way. I don't want Disney doing X-Men, nor do we need perfect continuity. We want good movies period, Ive loved and read comics all my life. Enough with perfect representations and costumes. We need movies that capture the heart of the comics. The X-Men are grit, and Wolverine is the most complex mainstream character in comics history.

7158948,5,B00X5ZSONM,"Days of Future Past is one of the top-tier X-Men films in my book, coming in only behind Logan. This film does a comendable job of trying to connect both the original trilogy and the First Class cast into one film. Even though this is the film that really screwed up the timelines, and makes it hard to watch the X-Men films in anything other than the release order, it still comes through with solid acting and a decent script. The action set-pieces are great and everything seems to click. The Rogue Cut is a nice, longer version that completes the narrative a bit, though it's not really necessary.

My Blu-ray came in great condition, and exactly as shown in the listing, no slipcover/O-Ring. My digital copy has an expiration date of 07/14/18. Overall, I'm pleased with this version and Blu-ray of the film.",1503014400,2,812,4.638888888888889

7158956,5,B00X5ZSONM,"I love X2: X-Men United and First Class, but I consider this the best of the franchise. It does a great job bringing together the original cast with the prequel cast. In the year 2023, older Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Logan (Hugh Jackman) back to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels, which are deadly robots who wipe out mutants and any humans who help them. The movie does a great job setting up the dystopian future, with haunting imagery that recalls the Holocaust that happened in Germany. It seems fitting, since Magneto, a Jew who survived the Holocaust, always feared humans would do to the mutants what the Nazi once did to Jews. To me, the stand out performances here are by James Mcavoy and Patrick Stewart as the younger and older Charles Xavier. This movie shows us a darker side to Xavier we've never seen in any of the previous movies. He's lost everything---not only the use of his legs, but also his adopted sister, Raven, his friendship wit Eric/Magneto, and his teachers and students to the Vietnam draft. So when Logan meets him, he's a mess and has no interest in helping him. Logan eventually gets him out of his depression to help him find Mystique, but even then, he doubts himself. So Logan lets younger Charles talk to older Charles through him via psychic link. Older, wiser Charles convinces younger Charles to hope again. It's an amazing scene between the two actors. The Rogue Cut is worth it because it explains things better than the theatrical  cut. For instance, it makes much clearer how the Sentinels were able to track down the place where the X-Men and Magneto were hiding. It also explains how the Sentinels could copy the mutants' powers. Mystique can copy mutants' appearance, not their powers. However, Rogue being captured and being used in their experiments makes more sense, since she can actually absorb mutants' powers. A great movie worth adding to your superhero movie collection.",1500336000,,2037,4.870317002881844
7158957,5,B00X5ZSONM,"As a relatively new fan of the X-men series, I've been a bit bored with the prequel series. However, Days of Future Past is a pivotal film in the series and brings things back to form, with the return of Director Brian Singer. After The Last Stand and Origins: Wolverine's questionable quality and First Class and The Wolverine's changes of form, it was nice to see the series return to its roots as well as prep itself for more films to come and in a way erase the unanimously worst two films of the series. That being said, as long as you've seen the first two films, you will know what's going on, though seeing all of them (In release order is best) certainly helps.

Now, The Rogue Cut obviously brings the titular character back, and offers more of a sequel to the first three films, including a redemption arc for Magneto in its additional 15+ minutes. That being said, it doesn't drag on like some Extended Editions do. This is the definitive version of the film, and even if you own the original cut, I'd say it's worth throwing out in favor of this cut. If you end up hating the added scenes, the original version is included as well, on the same disc in the blu-ray version.",1498089600,,1185,4.410958904109589

that's going for about $53 as of this writing (6/16/17) however I wanted this Rogue Cut of DOFP, which ruled out that collection that only contains the Theatrical Cut.  Plus, I noticed that you can get all six of the films cheaper on Amazon if you get them individually, which I plan to do eventually.

That said... the five or so bucks I paid extra to get this Rogue Cut edition was well worth it.  The extra footage adds more depth to the story and Rogue actually plays a bigger part, compared to the lightning quick cameo at the end of the theatrical cut.

The differences helped make the film easier and more fun to watch. The audio in this also seemed different, as I was able to hear slight changes in pre-existing scenes.

About the film itself, it was the best of the most recent trilogy, in my humble opinion. The acting felt more natural, not to mention that there was a larger cast of characters that neither felt over or under whelming to the plot. The plot itself was definitely a cliches time travel, save someone from commuting a grave mistake, but made its own way through, feeling fresh. It was a different take on the comic version, so fans be warned, but this version specifically paid tribute to the elements from that now iconic comic.",1486598400,2,814,4.652777777777778

However, this is an issue with Amazon streaming itself.  The voice track was at least a half second behind the video track, very annoying when viewing and disappointing after purchasing this video rather than renting.

I've never liked the use of time travel to make a story work.  The problems with paradox make it hard for me to stop thinking about the problems, and just enjoy the story.  Some stories handle it well (Dr Who is amazing, and Looper surprisingly handled it pretty well), but this movie just outright depended on it, and while I do like the movie, I'm trying to warn people reading this review that if logic is a concern for you, you might have trouble relaxing enough to just enjoy the movie.

Now with that warning out of the way, I do like this movie.  Mystique was never a character I thought a lot about when I was reading the comics.  She just wasn't that important, and shape changing never seemed that important.  But this movie does a really good job of turning her into an interesting character... which is really far more important than a list of powers.  Jennifer Lawrence does a good job with her part.  Not much more to say about that.

Finally, this movie has my favorite treatment of the power of super speed I've ever seen.  Maybe there are physics problems or nitpicks that can be found (like the music not keeping up or something), but Quicksilver is flat out awesome in this scene.  So... while character depth is usually the most important thing for me, this neat special effects scene steals the show for me in this movie.",1471910400,,1361,4.514285714285714

That notwithstanding, it's a great movie and a nice follow up to First Class. If you're a fan of the movies and see no problem with the license that they take with established comic lore, you won't be disappointed.

I saw the ads for this film and found it interesting and foolishly thought it would actually be quite different form X-Men DOFP theatrical version. However; i now feel completely stupid for renting this movie. The claim that it is a completely different movie is a bunch of bull! This movie contained Maybe 4-5 minutes of footage that differ from the original, which i thought was okay , but like most of the X films  was a bit of a let down. Brian Singer and the studio that came of with this marketing ploy should be ashamed of themselves for making these claims. I wasted 4 bucks that could have gone towards buying candy at a movie that I HADN""T ALREADY SEEN! One big star and that is because there is no negative star ratings. Disgusted with all those involved and refuse to watch anymore of the X-Films.",1465257600,,852,4.420382165605096
7159172,5,B00X5ZSONM,"I'm going to be honest, this movie was very surprising to me. All the previous X-Men films that I've seen thus far, even the good ones, had some issue with them. X-Men 3 and Wolverine: Origins are easy targets, but even the first X-Men film felt ponderously slow to me, and the predecessor to this movie, First Class, had some issues with what I felt were some clumsy character interactions and writing. The Wolverine was just watchable but not remarkable. This, though, was quite an amazing film, and really shows that if Fox really, really tries they can surpass their competition at (ironically) Marvel.

The movie essentially takes place in two different time periods at once. There's the grimdark future where mutants and even many humans are being mercilessly hunted down by incredibly deadly Sentinels against which they have virtually no chance of defeating, and there's the past, which despite the wars of the time, was a picnic by comparison. But the heroes and villains of this era are blithely unaware of their impending doom in the future, and it's up to Wolverine to travel back to the past and warn them in a desperate bid to prevent their grim fate. Personally, I think the past was the stronger part of the movie, as the future is mostly just a depressing slaughter.

What makes the film so good? I'd start with the performances, for one. The real standout, in my mind, is Michael Fassbender, who coldly exacts what he sees as the mutant agenda, and refusing to allow anyone to get in his way. His posture and bearing truly sell the character of Magneto, as do his precise gestures as he manipulates metal. Peter Dinklage appears in the film as Bolivar Trask as well, and as with his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, does an excellent job of conveying his character's brilliance as well as his casual disgregard for ethics, but anyone expecting hilarious quips isn't going to get them from the terminally serious Trask. The other actors were quite good as well, and if I had one complaint it would be that it seemed like they used some sort of prosthetics on the guy playing Nixon that made him look almost like a living cartoon character.

The film has quite a lot of action in it, so you're certainly not going to be let down in that regard. The future has a small army of mutants throwing everything they've got at the Sentinels, with some of the most impressive effects of the film occurring there. The past is not to be outdone, however, with some remarkable sequences, particularly one involving Quicksilver, and you just know Marvel has to be kicking themselves over the fact Fox outdid them on that character. And one neat touch is the Zapruder-esque footage captured of the mutants in action, which would no doubt serve as fodder for conspiracy theorists for generations. One letdown, oddly, is Wolverine, who gets to be violent and brutal exactly once before he's reduced to basically accomplishing little in the film beyond serving as a plot device. I guess they didn't want Hugh Jackman to overshadow the ""new"" generation?

It's not quite perfect, though. Probably the most glaring issue is the plot hole involving Professor X still being alive in the future with no explanation whatsoever. It's not enough to say they ignored the events of X-Men 3, because this movie contains clips of that film, and also acknowledges the death of Jean Grey. So... what gives? Additionally, I haven't seen the original cut, but I can safely say that anyone concerned that the new scenes might ruin the movie needn't worry. On the other hand, the reinsertion of Rogue into the film, while it gives the future people more to do, is kind of wasted, because Rogue doesn't get to do all that much. I mean, it's nice to see her again, I guess, but, well... ehhh...

I would say that even if you are getting tired of superhero movies, this film is so good that you may want to watch it anyway. And if you're a fan, then you'd have to be out of your mind to avoid seeing this movie.",1465171200,4,3986,4.672364672364672

Now, as far as the differences between this edition and the original theatrical release -- the extra scenes in this cut of the film are totally unnecessary, and I can understand precisely why they didn't make it into the theatrical film.  Imho, the original is better, if only because it's shorter and more concise. Of course, if you are an X-Men aficionado, you are going to get this anyway.

There is so much going on that it made me wonder a few times if the movie would have an entirely different ending. Right afterwards, I went and saw the newest movie of the series, X-Men: Apocalypse. Seeing this version also made certain points of that movie much more clear than with the other version. Definitely recommend the Rouge Cut highly.",1464652800,,456,4.6419753086419755

7159192,4,B00X5ZSONM,"The Rogue cut is nothing special. I actually prefer the original cut. Days of Future Past treats the characters like they are in a world of their own and not another Wolverine show. Although Wolverine is in it, his role is to move forward the intense friction of a shatter friendship between Charles and Eric also known as Professor X and Magneto. Wolverine returns to the 70's with a message of dread of what horrors awaits the world. Professor X and Magneto must unite to stop the Sentinels, giant mutant killing robots, before they even become a threat. It's a solid film. Killer robots, mutants, time travel, and an all star cast.",1464652800,,634,4.669642857142857

Because I guess the Blu-Ray player that I have on my 18 month old computer is just obsolete at this point and requires an upgrade to play this.,1464566400,,408,4.177215189873418

7159204,3,B00X5ZSONM,I read the comic books when I was younger regarding this leg of the X-Men saga. This movie was decent. My wife and I both agreed that the best part was Quicksilver and wished there was more of him. I guess our wish was granted in the new installment of X-Men that is due out soonish. What I really didn't enjoy is the complexity of the whole situation and that they are bringing in so many more mutants just how Avengers are bringing in more heroes. The core of X-Men that were set in First Class was good enough for me and it gets too complicated and in your face with adding more characters that only have 1 liners.,1464307200,,617,4.19327731092437

7159251,1,B00X5ZSONM,"I'm actually very hypercritical of comic book films to begin with so I really didn't have high hopes that the first comic book arc that I ever read was being made into a film.  I actually put off watching it right away because I needed to mentally prepare myself for the disappointment.

Sure enough, this story was NOTHING like the original arc of the same title in comic book form.  It was an aged Kate Pryde  that went back into time into young Kitty Pride's body in the original.  In the past of the original, Colossus, Angel, Nightcrawler, and Storm were all there.  The rest of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants was also missing from the film.

Also, the past is the wrong year where Professor X looks like a strutting around Brooklyn hipster instead of the bald head Charles Xavier who had a well established school.  The Sentinels looked nothing like the comic book.

This movie got it ALL WRONG!  This is a botching to the nth degree far worse than anything I could have imagined Hollywood coming up with.  Had they named it anything else but ""Days of Future Past"", would have given the movie a C-.  However, with that title and the aforementioned botching, I can't rate this movie higher than an F-!",1459382400,,1207,4.537037037037037

I can however tell you what it did for me. It answered a few plot holes that bugged me the first time I watched the movie, and I really enjoyed it. There really was no need to have cut out Rogue's part in the original version of the movie. If they had left it in, so much of the ending would have made sense and had been more plausible. Instead they needlessly cut out, in my opinion, important character issues like Kitty being hurt and how did she survive long enough to keep Wolverine in the past. That just didn't seem plausible in the original edit of the movie, and with this cut they explain what should have happened to Kitty and to Bobby. Although these are minor issues in the grander scheme of the story plot, it was a much more plausible and interesting version of the movie. I liked it and think it should have been the original version.",1457568000,,1021,4.268041237113402

7159287,5,B00X5ZSONM,"Comic book movies are probably the last genre of movies that rarely produces extended editions or directors' cuts.  Classics of every other genre, such as Amadeus, the LOTR franchise, Oliver Stone's JFK, even the original Star Wars trilogy, have had alternate cuts, directors' cuts or extended editions produced.  For comic book movies, we only have the multiple cuts of Superman II, and more recently, the extended edition of The Watchmen... But the three big recent franchises; the Avengers movies of Disney, the X-Men movies, and the Batman franchise of Warner Brothers, all were left unaltered from theater to home video.  Until now!  2014 saw three big releases by Marvel, with two from Disney and this X-Men classic.  Probably one of the most popular comic book movies of all time, along with one of the greatest ensemble cast movies of the past decade or so, the X-Men Days of Future Past film was rumored to have undergone major edits before being released.  And so Bryan Singer and the studio gave the fans what they've always wanted, a home video release with both the theatrical version and a different, director's cut.  Both are amazing movies, but the Rogue Cut; i.e. the director's cut, is clearly the better version.  Longer, with a slightly bigger cast, and additional scenes of romance, comedy and tragedy, the Rogue Cut is a must watch for any fan of the X-Men universe.

Besides the two movies, this package also provides numerous interviews of the cast and crew that dive into the history of this movie, explaining how the theatrical version was arrived at, and what led to the release of the Rogue Cut.  Overall, two great movies in one package.",1456099200,,1666,4.875886524822695

7159299,5,B00X5ZSONM,"Its amazing how similar and yet how different the Theatrical version is in comparison to The Rogue Cut yet both are Xmen at their best. After X3 and Xmen Origins Wolverine both being huge steps back , Xmen :First Class allowed a Reboot of sorts and I like The older Prof X & Magneto but I love McAvoy s take on Xavier more (even if Stewart is closer to cannon) and Fastbender showed us Magneto and continues to be my favorite character in DOFP. The Rogue cut has actually quite a few totally new scenes and while the extra 12-15 min scared Fox fearing a long movie, The Rogue ties it all together better and I wish all ""Super-Hero Genres"" considered doing what Singer did.
I paid $14.99 and while seeing it for only $9.99 stings a lil, i hope it leads to more blu rat sales to make the MCU and DCU take a page out of this playbook because after hearing Age of Ultron was over 3 hrs of movie, only to shave  40 min off then offer a subpar ""special features"" on the blu ray  proved that the MCU is great but Rogue cut proves they can do more",1454371200,,1039,4.138613861386139

Good action and acting. However, there's a reason the 'Rogue Cut' was not released in theaters. The Rogue subplot feels like filler and doesn't add much to the movie aside from an unnecessary love triangle dynamic and a known character that feels shoehorned in. Unless you're a big fan of seeing more of Rogue, you'd do just as well to just purchase the theatrical version with its tighter storytelling.",1454025600,,561,4.91578947368421
7159303,5,B00X5ZSONM,I loved the extended edition more than the theatrical because it gave the movie a lot more meat. I felt that the theatrical didn't give us enough of what was happening in the future with the older characters. The addition of Rogue herself doesn't bring a lot to the movie but it just adds more urgency to an already exciting movie. Feel free to trade in your theatrical copy.

The Rogue cut could have simply been deleted scenes or and alternate version because it's not much different from the theatrical release. While I love Rogue and missed her in this movie, I totally understand why her scenes were cut out. It didn't really add to the movie or help move the story along at all! I won't give away what happens in her like 2 scenes, or the other 2 added scenes with other characters, but again I will say they were not needed.

My first issue is not with the movie itself but the disc. Upon putting it in my Sony Blu-Ray player, it said it could not play and my player needed an update in order for it to work. First time I've ever had this problem with my player so I know it's the disc itself. Luckily my wife has a blu-ray player as well that it worked on. What I was hoping to see though was a fresh version of the movie with lots of added things that would make it even better. Nope. A few small things tacked on here and there that really don't contribute to the plot at all. The only good thing I can get from this is it definitely made sense to find Rogue and have her switch places with Kitty after she was injured by Wolverine. But I really don't like the fact that it came with the cost of sacrificing Bobbie much earlier in the movie.

8715135,4,B00X5ZSONM,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. DON'T READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE THEATRICAL VERSION.

The theatrical version of the movie is pretty good, if you disregard the unintentional timeline inconsistencies rife across the X-Men cinematic universe. There are some elements which seem forced and needed further explanation to make sense.

I bought the Rogue Cut version despite already owning the theatrical version, because I love those little extra bits and pieces--and the Rogue Cut does have some scenes which weren't in the theatrical release (which are not in the deleted scenes on the theatrical bluray and which have nothing to do with Rogue). For example, we find out that Peter Maximoff actually has two sisters, while the theatrical version only shows/mentions one. There's a scene with Raven and Hank at the mansion. A few little alternate things here and there that add a little something the theatrical version doesn't have.

Bringing Rogue in is... awful. Ridiculous. Pointless. Unnecessary. It adds nothing to the film and just feels forced and awkward.

Ultimately, if you're the kind of fan who likes to see all those little extra details that otherwise you wouldn't get to see, it's worth replacing your theatrical copy with this one (it has both). If you don't really care about those things, don't both with this.
