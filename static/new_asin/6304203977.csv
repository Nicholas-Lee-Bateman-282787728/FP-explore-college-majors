  Scott, Robin, Lea, Jason,Sabrina, & Jackie were funny as sin. But the highlight for me was the Sesame Street riff by Rob. I still refer to it 12 years later.",1200182400,2,353,3.9577464788732395
8326418,5,6304203977,"ok, this is the coolest movie I have ever seen. I could follow the humour because I've been watching The Kids In The Hall since I was 4 year old, now I'm 16. And I still love it! It's something I can't get sick of no matter what because I grew up watching it. Scott Thompson is like, my hero. I love him so much, and I love all of the kids, but I love Scott's Buddy Cole character more then any of them. Buddy Cole is so sexy...So is Scott (same person) but still, you know what I mean...these men have made scetch comedy ""COOL"" once again. AND THEY ARE CANADIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!...",1024790400,2,578,4.169642857142857
