8186135,4,B000OPPA1K,"This is a South Korean kid's movie about the son of gangsters and the son of the President of South Korea attending the same classroom (fifth grade is my guess).  It's just a bunch of stupidity, with all the cast putting in an honest effort at this type of comedy.  The entire cast is upbeat and fairly charming.  Production value is good with scenery locations and props. Gag Concert fans are probably familiar with all this.  Another Galgalri Family movie had a vampire plot, but this isn't the one, though some plot descriptions mistakenly mix up Galgalri 2.  It's not painful to watch for an adult who likes The Three Stooges.  Kids will probably love it.",1262131200,,659,4.637931034482759
