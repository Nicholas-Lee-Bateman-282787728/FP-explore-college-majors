461855,5,6302413435,"This is an excellent film, boasting the best courtroom scene of any movie. Dietrich gives a marvelous and richly-textured performance. This is her finest screen work since ""Der Blaue Engel"" in 1930. But the film  belongs entirely to Charles Laughton, who gives a performance for the ages.  Along with Spencer Tracy, Laughton is probably the greatest screen actor  and he proves it beyond any doubt here.
Laughton brilliantly mixes comedy  with drama as Sir Wilfred, aided by his real-life wife, ELsa Lancaster. His  interplay with her is hilarious.
The ending is one of the greatest  surprise finales ever done. The only criticism is Tyrone Power, who is  completely outclassed in the acting department by both Dietrich and  especially Laughton. Notice his over-acting and screaming as he stands  accused in the witness box.
Watch Laughton throughout the movie for a  tutorial on positively memerizing acting talent. A great film with a  stand-out performance.",962928000,7,960,5.25
461856,5,6302413435,"Other films have had courtroom scenes, but ""Witness for the Prosecution"" soars above them.  Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Elsa Lanchester show what acting is all about.  Laughton's crafty  barrister is matched by Dietrich as the ""witness.""
But, what  surprised me the most upon first viewing of this film was the performance  by Tyrone Power.  I had long dismissed him as one of those ""pretty boy  actors"" of whom millions of American women fantasized.  He turns in an  Oscar-caliber performance as the defendent who is on trial for the murder  of his matronly ""friend.""
A well-written and supremely acted  motion picture that deserves shelf space in a videophile's collection.",959472000,4,687,5.2110091743119265
461857,5,6302413435,"Fans of mystery will love this gem starring two of Hollywood's greatest, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester (did anyone think I was going to say Tyrone Power?).  This is one of the few films that Laughton did with Elsa,  his wife (along with ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"") and the  warfare between Laughton's character, an aging barrister, and Lanchester's,  that of a nagging nurse, is alone worth the price of the video.  The plot  centers on aging British lawyer Sir Wilfred Robarts, who must defend a man  accused of murder (played by Power, who is adequate) while trying to figure  out his enigmatic, vindictive wife (played by Dietrich).  Both Laughton and  Lanchester were nominated for Oscars (I don't have to tell you they lost -  90% of the time the great performances do).  Definitely the best Agatha  Christie adaptation to film, rich with great characterization and a  startling ending.  Highly recommended viewing (rent or buy this one,  instead of ""Star Wars: Episode One"")",956707200,8,993,4.963414634146342

Dietrich and Laughton spar brilliantly, the whole script is beautifully crafted and the acting of a very high standard throughout. I've watched this film a  dozen times and still love it. There's one unintentionally funny moment  that I'm astonished wasn't picked up by the continuity department: When  Tyrone Power leans forward in the witness box and is filmed from behind you  get to see the outline of the corset he is wearing to give him a figure.

Sir Wilfred promised not to take on any strenuous case. However in exchange for a chance to pilfer a forbidden cigar he soon gets intriguingly involved in a murder case. You can tell that Leonard Stephen Vole is being actively accused of murder based on circumstantial evidence. Sr. Wilfred after giving charismatic Leonard the eye-glass test is sure that he is innocent and knows if he does not take an active part in the trial that Leonard is doomed. To make matters worse Leonard's wife Christine Helm Vole (Marlene Dietrich), his only alibi, is some sort of cool character and looks suspicious her self.

Will Sir Wilfred take on the case? And if so will he die trying?
What is Christine's secret?
How will it turn out in the end?

461978,5,6302413435,"This is a brilliant masterpiece. I am surprised there are relatively few reviews. It is one of the best movies ever made. The 1957 black and white film is based on Agatha Christie's highly acclaimed world-wide stage success. Charles Laughton is perfect in the film as the barrister, the defense attorney in the English court. It is a pleasure to watch him act. Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich are also superb, especially Dietrich. The screen play was written by Billy Wilder with another, and he directed the film. The film is filled with suspense, but it has lots of humor.
The story takes place in England in 1952. A man is arrested for killing a somewhat elderly woman. He claims he is innocent and looks like it. His barrister is convinced he is innocent. The police claim that he made the elderly woman like him so that he, who is poor, will have her leave him her huge wealth. She does change her will and does leave him her wealth just before she is killed. It is clear that the woman was killed after 9:30 PM. He states that his wife will substantiate that he came home at 9:25 PM. However, she becomes a witness for the prosecution and states that he did not come home until 10:10 PM. Her husband cannot understand why she is lying. He had saved her from squalor in Germany and brought her to the US as his wife. And he loves her more than anything.",1498089600,,1360,4.422310756972111

The story by Agathe Christie is gripping as usual, with it's endless twists and totally unforseen ending. The acting is excellent. Tyrone Power is good but not extraordinary. Marlen Dietrich gives us a superb performance, very authoritative and totally believable. She really was a superb actress. In my opinion the real star of the film is Charles Laughton, both witty and funny at times and at the same time very serious when the role demands it, giving one of his best performances ever.
The blu-ray transfer is excellent, providing a very crisp and clear image, even when projected to fill in a large 5 X 3 ft screen.

That, in itself, is sufficient to recommend, but what I wish to focus on here is the film's penultimate moment.  Sir Wilfrid, stunned by what has happened is deep in thought; his always pesky nurse/nemesis has at last surrendered to his brilliant tenacity when she lifts his wig into frame at precisely the right placement (meaning we can still see Sir Wilfred's steely gaze in profile).  However, in the briefest of time, when he sees that she is holding his treasured wig, his eyes widen in astonishment followed instantly by a hint of smile.  In just the merest of gestures, Laughton communicates a tremendous amount  of significance.",1493251200,,758,4.929133858267717

462041,3,6302413435,"Witness for the Prosecution (1957).  Set in Great Britain, 1953. In this well-known, considered classic film, screen legends Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester, supported by legions of well-known transatlantic actors, star. It is based on one of the most famous works of Agatha Christie, British mystery author, bestselling novelist worldwide of all time.  The work was honored first as an iconic 20 page short story; then a hit theatrical play that enjoyed long runs on both sides of the Atlantic, written by Christie herself; then this hit all-star Hollywood movie, based on the play, with script written by Harry Kurnitz, and the brilliant European director in exile Billy Wilder who also directed.

Returning  to work following a heart attack, Sir Wilfrid Robarts, (Charles Laughton), known as a barrister for the hopeless, (barrister: a lawyer permitted to practice in that countrys courts), takes on a murder case, much to the exasperation of his medical team, led by his overly protective  private nurse, Miss Plimsoll, (Elsa Lanchester).  Plimsoll is determined to prevent Robarts return to his hard living ways - including excessive cigar smoking and drinking, particularly brandy  odd, that, two of famed British wartime prime minister Winston Churchills favorite vices-- while he takes his medication and gets his much needed rest. That murder case is defending American war veteran Leonard Vole, (Tyrone Power), a handsome young man, out of work, a struggling inventor who is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely, wealthy widowed acquaintance, Mrs. Emily French, who is presented in a particularly stereotyped way, as a foolish middle-aged woman. Initial evidence is circumstantial but points to Vole as the murderer. Mind you, Vole was seemingly happily married to East German former beer hall performer Christine Vole, (Marlene Dietrich), whom he met during the occupation of Germany at the end of World War II.  Yet he fostered that friendship with Mrs. French in the hopes that she would finance one of his many inventions to the tune of a few hundred pounds. He is now accused by Mrs. Frenchs longtime devoted housekeeper of the murder of Mrs. French; he does, indeed, stand to profit from the vast fortune the victim had left him in her will.  Soon enough, he finds himself standing in the dock at the Old Bailey, on trial for his life. But he is not fighting these charges alone:  Leonard is adamant that the testimony of his wife Christine will prove his innocence.

This glossy black and white film, which was entirely made in the studio, evidently threw money at the screen.  The named characters are many, well-cast; there are many extras, vehicles, interiors are lush, etc. The movie introduced the character of Miss Plimsoll: shes not in story or play.  This was done so as to give the part to Elsa Lanchester, Laughtons real-life wife, give husband and wife a chance to trade cute barbs.  The film was set in 1953, a few years before it was made.  As the European theater of World War II had closed in 1944, not much is made of that conflict in the film, though its principals must have been affected by that war. Whether they suffered, as we now know it, Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder, (PTSD) that influenced their actions, we are never to know. The popular star vehicle is also evidently set among the upper crust of society, Tyrone Power as Vole may be poor, but he is clearly of smooth upper class origins; in fact the film is largely what would have been called back then a drawing room comedy that contains an incidental courtroom drama.

The picture was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Laughton) and Supporting Actress (Lanchester). Many, if not most, people will be acquainted with the courtroom drama at the core of this movie.  If its new to you, however, be ready for its famous triple shock ending.

Tyrone Power is in a fix. Hes charged with murder and the evidence is stacked against him. The only thing he has going for him is his wife. But shes German and its just after WW2 and the jury doesnt like her one bit. Only his imminent barrister, sees some hope.

This film is based on the Agatha Christie novel. Accordingly, there are twists aplenty. Please note it is a film of its time, so it features the British social strata with its courtroom pomp, societal formalities, servants and the death penalty. Its also in black and white.

Now, I found it quite fascinating but I watched it with a room full of fifteen year olds, who were not so engaged. Sure some of the characters seemed completely archaic but it worked well enough for me. The various twists were well delivered and I was genuinely surprised at some developments.

Tyrone Power looks the part and has charisma, but he's out-acted by Laughton and Dietrich (and really, there's no shame in that).

462443,4,6302413435,"Cinema icons Marlene Dietrich, Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, and John Williams lead this excellent courtroom drama that left filmgoers riveted from its unexpected turns and surprising climax. Directed by the legendary Billy Wilder (whose list of noteworthy credits include such Hollywood classics as Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Ace in the Hole, Stalag 17, Some Like It Hot, and The Apartment) and adapted from Agatha Christies runaway play, Witness for the Prosecution has never lost its power to captivate audiences until the last, spellbinding frame.

When rich widow Emily French is found slain, her acquaintance Leonard Vole (Power) is the prime suspect. Voles only chance for acquittal is the testimony of his wife Christine (Dietrich), but his defense falls to pieces when Christine brings to light some shocking revelations of her own. Witness for the Prosecution was nominated for 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (Laughton), and Supporting Actress (Elisa Lanchester).",1456963200,,1021,5.62987012987013

462480,4,6302413435,"Some excellent background provided in prior reviews, but I have several important points to add. Before beginning, let me say that this film should be required viewing and belongs on everyone's DVD shelf or playlist. That said, there are some serious script issues. Marlene explains to Laughton after Power's acquittal that she got the idea to appear as a witness for the prosecution AFTER visiting Laughton when he pointed out no jury would believe the testimony of a loving wife. But from the moment she enters his chambers, it is evident she has already chosen her strategy. A much more serious issue is her timing: Laughton rests his case for the defense and it is that evening she calls him offering new evidence. Many lawyers would not have leapt for the dangling fruit. And since even the Crown's most experienced prosecutor did not believe there was precedent for re-opening the case for the defense, it is surprising a German immigrant would feel her letters would be admitted. My other issue is the scheming character played by Power. He learns he is to inherit the 80,000 upon the woman's death, mulls it over for a week, and his great plan is: bonk her on the head and run home with no alibi. His protestations of his innocence made ME want to strangle him -- it gets REAL annoying. Finally, there's talk about her probable perjury trial. Perjury? She actually tells the truth on the stand. She doesn't know a Max; her husband was guilty; she wrote the letters. The only untruth she utters is that she doesn't love her husband. Oh well. All this aside, still a great film, and it is pure delight watching Laughton, who was gay, and his wife Elsa Lanchester, who plays his overbearing nurse. She is a pure joy to watch; every clap of her hands to punctuate her commands are perfect.",1451433600,,1793,4.677215189873418

Saw this for the first time when I was in 12th grade and thought I had taken a class I could go to sleep in; Film Studay.  I had worked very hard in school up until my senior year, and had done well in very advanced classes so I could get into a good college.  It didn't matter now what I took since my applications had already been sent out.  Well it turned out I had an amazing teacher, and it was the most interesting class I ever took in high school as he introduced us to so many black and white classes that I never would have watched at home.  On the Waterfront, Chinatown, Citizen Cane, Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi and my favorite, Witness for the Prosecution.  From the minor laughable things, like Laughton constantly trying to outfox Plimsoll (his nurse) over whiskey and cigars (and then that surprise ending about that), to the inside of an English courtroom from another era, to the incredible acting by Laughton and Dietrich and of course an ending very few people I think could have guessed, this movie had me so engrossed, I came home from school the day we finished watching it  (this was in the VHS era well before the Internet) trying desperately to figure out how I could get a copy of the movie and watch it ten more times.  It is amazing how much older Laughton looks than he really is here (43).  Maybe that is why he died at only 63, and even more of a shame for Laughton was that he had to hide his private life from  then intolerant public.  Just a fabulous movie, with all of the smaller parts performed wondrously. You don't want to rent this you want to buy it.",1447027200,2,1664,4.321543408360129

462640,4,6302413435,"Beautifully acted by Laughtin, Dietrich and Tyrone Power still it came off to me, at least, a bit like a High School play.  Towards the end of the film, Laughtin the Barrister, complains that his success is simply too neat, too symmetrical.  Therefore, we are informed that there is a twist to the case.  In my opinion, the solution to the 'twist' produces a result that is more 'too neat' and more 'too symmetrical' than was the original 'solution.'  This might have been handled better had some of the terminal action occurred outside the court room.  In anything even approaching real life, it is extraordinary unlikely that everyone would confess in the very courtroom within minutes of absolutiontoo much of a suspension of disbelief.",1440201600,,739,4.92741935483871

add to my already large collection and sorry I didn't get it sooner! It's one of my favorite movies and probably one of the best 100 movies
ever made. I agree Laughton is exceptional as usual and Power gives a great performance as well but I think Dietrich over acts in spots
but she's still very good. The movie starts off great right from the start and never lets up until the surprise climax in the court room. The
great John Williams TV actor and in many Hitchcock productions is here too. This is a must have for classic movie fans.",1437955200,,681,4.08955223880597

Virtuoso performances by Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester, Tyrone Power, Una O'Connor and in fact every single performer--the actor playing the judge, the man playing the prosecuting attorney and all the rest of the lawyers and police officers.  Astonishing plot twists toward the blockbuster ending (or better stated, ""endings,"" because there are at least two more astonishing plot twists just when you think the movie has ""ended."")  The cabaret scene in wartime Berlin is a bit longer than it's worth; otherwise not a second is wasted in this masterpiece.  In my opinion this is the best film ever based on an Agatha Christie story.

463122,5,6302413435,"This terrific courtroom drama from 1957 is based on the hit play by Agatha Christie, and it's been called ""the best Hitchcock movie not made by Hitchcock."" That pretty much sums it up. It's a gripping, surprising story of a man on trial for his life (Tyrone Power), the eminent defense attorney trying to free him (Charles Laughton), and his mysterious wife (Marlene Dietrich) whose shady agenda is unclear. And it has a shocker of an ending that only Agatha Christie could have imagined.

This new DVD version of WFTP is excellent, a big improvement on the earlier MGM DVD. It's been remastered in high definition, so it looks and sounds much better than before. (I can't speak for the new Blu-Ray version, but I'll assume it's at least as good as this DVD--why wouldn't it be?) This is a real upgrade of a classic thriller with Billy Wilder's excellent direction and career-best performances from Power, Laughton, and especially Dietrich.

463292,5,6302413435,"This is one of the all time GREAT old movies, a true classic. Several of Sir Charles Laughton's movies fall into that category. This 1957 movie features an all star cast: Sir Charles Laughton, as Barrister, Sir Wilfred  Robards, nicknamed Wilfred The Fox, and known as a barrister for the hopeless, his real life wife, Elsa Lanchester, as his talkative nurse, Miss Plimsoll, Tyrone Power, as Leonard Vole, Marlene Dietrich as Mrs. Christine Vole, John Williams as Solicitor Sir Brogan-Moore, a young--and gorgeous--Ruta Lee, as Diana, Philip Tonge is Chief Inspector Hearne, Henry Daniel is Solicitor Mayhew, you may remember him from the Errol Flynn movie, The Sea Hawk, in which he played the part of the traitor, Lord Wolfingham. Ian Wolfe is the butler, Carter, and Una O'Connor is the crusty maid to Mrs. French, played by Norma Varden. The English are known to have a virtually limitless supply of character actors, people you've seen a hundred times, but can never recall their names. Several of them appear in this film.

The movie opens as Sir Wilfred, having been released from the hospital ""on probation"" is on the way to his offices, with Miss Plimsoll insipidly chattering away non-stop. He arrives at his office to discover that they've put his wig in mothballs, and apparently intend the same for him. He's to handle no more stressful criminal cases.

Leonard Vole shows up in the company of Sir Brogan-Moore, who thinks Mr. Vole needs a Barrister. There's a nice exchange in which Sir Wilfred--they don' call him Wilfred The Fox for nothing--appropriates a cigar from Brogan-Moore, intending to sneak it past Miss Plimsoll, if he can, but she's ever on the alert for his tricks.

He is apologetic in informing Brogan-Moore and Mr. Vole that, although he has taken their cigar, he cannot take their case, and prepares to submit himself to Miss Plimsoll, Hot Cocoa, and an afternoon nap. Presently, Mrs. Vole (Marlene Dietrich) shows up, shocks all there, and Sir Wilfred finally agrees to take the case on, come Hell or Miss Plimsoll.

The trial goes forward (I don't want to spoil any of the details for anyone who has not already seen the movie.) with enough twists and turns to satisfy--not to mention confuse--the most avid fan of courtroom drama. At one point, Miss Plimsoll, observing from the balcony, by now cheering for her patient, exclaims: ""Wilfred The Fox; that's what they call him, and that's what he is"". But there are even more plot twists to come. This should keep you on the edge of your seat, even after the verdict is in, and you think it's all over. They even post a request at the end of the film, asking that you not divulge the denouement. It's a thriller right to the end; you won't be disappointed.",1412121600,,2740,4.796610169491525

They requested that i return it yet i had said that i wouldn't.  when the price came back to what i originally paid, i bought it again and just after i had done so, i got an email from amazon stating that they would recharge me for the original again.  so i paid twice for the item.  i have purchased thousands films, books and CDs over the many years and often they come damaged but you put up with them unless they are really bad.  my track record has been excellent and that must show on my profile but after this i will no longer buy anything else from amazon.com.

463518,5,6302413435,"""Witness for the Prosecution"" is the latest Billy Wilder film to receive a Blu-ray upgrade this year following Criterion's ""Ace in the Hole"" and Warner's ""Sabrina"" and Universal's ""Double Indemnity"". Through an arrangement with MGM, Kino Lorber has licensed a large number of film titles mainly from their United Artists catalog for release on Blu-ray, an arrangement similar to the one like Twilight Time. One of it's first releases is ""Witness for the Prosecution""(1957) which is not only one of the best courtroom dramas ever made but one of the best films Wilder directed during his long career. Coming right before his two year back to back classics, ""Some Like it Hot""(1959) and ""The Apartment""(1960), ""Witness for the Prosecution"" has Wilder working at the top of his craft. Based on the story and stage play by Agatha Christie it doesn't get any better when it comes to suspense, betrayal, courtroom theatrics and ultimately the surprise ending of all time. Ever the master filmmaker, Wilder withheld the final pages of the script from the actors during the climactic ending in order to get the best performances possible. And what performances. Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power(his last role) and Marlene Dietrich are superb in their roles and are given excellent support by a who's who of British actors including Elsa Lanchester, John Williams, Henry Daniell, Una O'Connor and Ian Wolfe among others. The verbal bickering between Laughton and Lanchester(married in real life) is one of the joys of the film. All this is brought out even better on Blu-ray. The video is nearly flawless with only a few scenes exhibiting any softness(mostly during the transition from present to flashback scenes). The stunning B&W cinematography by Russell Harlan is a wonder on Blu-ray(Bitrate: 21.00) and nearly every detail of Alexandre Trauner's set decoration is brought to new life on this Blu-ray presentation. That is most apparent in his re-creation of the ""Old Bailey"" where most of the film takes place. Blacks, whites and grays are balanced with a pleasing contrast throughout. There are no vertical lines, specks, torn or damaged frames and anyone purchasing this new Blu-ray from Kino Lorber will be pleased. The Audio(DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0) is crisp and clear and free from any noise artifacts. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is 116 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.66.1) and is in English only. Special features include a short interview with Billy Wilder discussing ""Witness"" and the Original Theatrical Trailer. The Blu-ray itself is housed in a sturdy Blu-ray case(not one of those eco-cutout cases). It doesn't get any better than ""Witness for the Prosecution"" and now that it's finally on Blu-ray, it should be an essential part of any film collector's library and comes highly recommended.",1406851200,13,2794,5.197339246119734
463519,5,6302413435,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.  Good acting especially by Charles Laughton who obviously felt comfortable in a role he was aged right for.  A good moral values movie too that actually put lawyers in a positive light, seemingly impossible in the more recent past.  It also highlighted how easy it could be, at least in a fictional movie plot, to manipulate a justice court system with a judge and jury.  I'm thinking of OJ and the ""if the (shrunk from being washed) leather glove don't fit...."" scenario as a real life comparison.  What a scam!",1406764800,,550,4.6875

Charles Laughton is perhaps a little too mannered for my taste but is an undeniable presence. This murder mystery is justly noted for it's surprises and twists.
I have never been an admirer of Agatha  Christie and her red herrings and manipulative plots. Wilder helped adapt this movie from the play and made several character additions which I am sure  added to the texture of the movie. Still, the story seems too clever by far and the ending, while pleasing to many, left me frustrated.

463599,5,6302413435,"I saw this movie on TV MANY years ago when it was put on as one of those special presentation by one of the major networks (as they did with many blockbuster movies) and I really enjoyed it.  This BD copy is excellent.  Picture and sound are really nice, KL did a good job.  Good source material and nice transfer,  it is in ""Glorious B&W"" which to me makes it more effective.  Packaging is good, thin case so it is compact.
Charles Laughton is great as the crusty old barrister, pulling out all the stops and giving an excellent performance.  Elsa Lanchester (his real life wife) plays off him very well as his nurse (many will remember her as Mary Shelley and the Bride in Bride of Frankenstein)and there are some subtle comic moments in their ongoing battle to guard his health.  Marlene Dietricht does an excellent job as the distraught wife and later as her character morphs (she looks great and her costumes are excellent making her look sexy for an ""older woman"").  The only one I would have changed is Tyrone Power, I would have cast Ray Milland for the part but Power did a really good job in the part so there are no complaints on that.  John Williams and William Daniell turn in their usual top notch performances as the quintessential English barrister and solicitor (or Detective or aristocrat, etc. as they played them all in so many pictures).
This is an Agatha Christie play that Billy Wilder turned into an excellent movie.  Since it was a play the acting reflects the original writing to dramatize the situations but Wilder makes good use of it.  Being a Christie story it is full of twists and surprises.  It takes place in 1952 so we get the full ""Old Baily"" treatment in the courtroom with wigs and robes,etc. Although there are only three major sets (and a couple of minor ones) for the action Billy Wilder photographs it so it never looks stagey.  He keeps the action moving along at a good pace, which is hard to do with a courtroom drama.  If you do not like English courtroom dramas or old style settings and acting skip this as you will be disappointed, remember it came from a stage play so there is no real action outside the courtroom other than a few flashbacks.
You cannot say much about the plot without spoiling things for those that have not seen it as there are several plots twists that occur.  Basically Powers is accused of murdering a lonely widow for her money and his wife is his only alibi.  She wants Laughton to handle the case as she believes he is her husband's only hope.  Laughton just out of hospital is not suppose to take any criminal cases...can she convince him to take it and if he does can he get him off and how would he do it?  More than that would reveal one of the many twists to the plot.",1406160000,,2749,4.431411530815109

463731,5,6302413435,"Note: I saw this film viz XFinity On Demand.

Witness For The Prosecution boasts an impressive cast led by Academy Award winner Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich. The plot is taken from a popular play by Agatha Christie, and the result on film is nothing short of perfection. The dialogue is sharp and witty, particularly between the barrister (Laughton) and his nurse (Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's real-life wife). The acting, of course, is first-rate. To say anymore concerning this motion picture would be a capital crime. I shall therefore, conclude by repeating Mr. Laughton's words from the trailer: 'The verdict is usually the end of a courtroom picture, but here, it is only the BEGINNING of a SERIES of climaxes, which I DEFY you to guess.'

I highly recommend this film.

But it doesn't matter.  It's fun, it holds the viewer's attention, and has a powerful emotional arc, resolving neatly just seconds before the end.  It's the perfect example of a 1950s Hollywood movie, perfectly paced, brilliantly directed and edited.  Elsa Lanchester and Charles Laughten are wonderful, have perfect comic timing, and steal the show.",1394064000,,562,5.021505376344086
463794,5,6302413435,"If you have never seen this film, I advise you not to ask anyone who has seen it to tell you about it. Just see it. This film has everything you could possibly want in a courtroom drama: a feisty but lovable defense attorney, known as barristers in Britain; a defendant equally as likable; and a heinous crime at the center of the plot. The immortal Charles Laughton seems born to play Sir Wilfrid, a cantankerous but lovable barrister regarded as one of the best defense attorneys in London. His doctor and nurse try to dissuade him from taking anymore clients, but when he receives an intriguing case, he can't resist. He loves trials as much as cigars and brandy. Part of the fun concerns his nurse constantly trying to keep his cigars and him far apart.

Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power in his last film), an American and former G.I. who decided to stay in Britain after the war, is in trouble. He is accused of murdering a wealthy widow, Mrs French, for her money. His wife Christine is a German he literally saved from the rubble towards the end of the war. Wilfrid listens and believes Vole's story about how he met the widow and about their friendship. In the end he claims their relationship was only platonic and claims innocence; Christine is his devoted wife, not the widow.

Wilfrid agrees to take the case. After Vole is arrested for murder, his wife Christine Vole (played by the incomparable Marlene Dietrich) calls on the barrister. She seems strangely detached from her husband. Wilfrid decides against calling her as a witness. During the trial, the prosecution paints Vole as a hard-up inventor who dreams of having the money he knows will be bequeathed him from the widow in the event of her death. He even stops at a travel agency and looks at all the cruises and vacation spots. But then a surprise witness appears: Christine comes to the courtroom as a witness--for the prosecution. Apparently in Britain, wives cannot be called to testify against their husbands but in some interesting legal maneuvering, Christine is able to testify.

A compelling film from start to finish. If you have never seen this film before, the ending still holds up as one of the greatest twists in a courtroom drama. It makes sense that the original play was written by Agatha Christie whose twists are always the ones completely impossible to predict. While Power is certainly convincing as the young defendant, Laughton and Dietrich steal the show. This is really their film. And after you see it, please, as the film asks, do not reveal the ending to other would-be viewers.",1394064000,,2575,4.7305122494432075

For two elegant, beautiful human beings (in their prime) they are not beautiful to look at together here.  She is too old, for one, and she simply can NOT sing and never could.  Mr. Power looks, at times, like a cross between Bela Lugosi and a thinner Raymond Burr.  The two have no chemistry together.

The courtroom scenes are most engrossing, the famous plot twists startling, and almost every line, gesture, and expression of Laughton's deserves an accolade. One of my personal favorites occurs when the corpulent Laughton first rides his electric stair chair (to ride up and down stairs for the poor of health). He jokes about the ""barrister falling off the banister,"" a most amusing bit of wordplay. Said chair is used on multiple occasions for comedic and tongue-in-cheek dramatic effect-just one of many great aspects to this masterful film.

464359,5,6302413435,"Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is wonderful due to skilled stage actors, especially Charles Laughton, allowed to ""do their thing.""

It's a movie presentation of a stage play.

Stage actors are wonderful, but different than most movie actors.

Stage acting is different than movie acting, and oddly, worth seeing when presented in movie form.

Stage acting as a big business has largely disappeared (2012) and isn't seen often in the present age because stage plays have almost disappeared and are only a memory supported by a great film like this, and that's a shame.

Camera tricks, movie magic, light shows, special effects and pyrotechnics, virtuoso editing never contributed to good stage acting and good stage presentations.

Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is good because writing and the acting are allowed to dominate the movie in a setting (mostly a British ""Old Bailey"" large courtroom) which is well designed and plausible, but which doesn't change, and certainly never becomes the star of the movie.

The actors and the story carry the movie. The script allows actors to declaim at length, and with actors as good as most in Witness For The Prosecution (1957), that'a a treat.

The only actor who doesn't carry his part of the movie is Tyrone Power (1914 - 1958), then only one year away from his early death from a heart attack at age 44, and obviously overweight and in bad physical health and without energy or power his part called for.

He was used anyway because he was ""good box office"" in spite of his obvious bad health and need to avoid movie stardom pressures and challenges.

Heartless Hollywood strikes again, as so often in movie history.

He turned the lead role of ""Leonard Vole"" in the movie down at first, then accepted when he was offered $300,000 plus a percentage of the movie's profits. He is seen with his top suit coat button attached to hide his pot belly and protruding stomach, since a normal front middle button attachment wasn't possible.

Every other actor in the movie shines, except Tyrone Power, and the others are so good, and the script is so good and allows great actors to perform without interruption, one wonders why the success formula wasn't repeated much or ever after Witness For The Prosecution (1957) was made.

One answer may be that the times changed..... ""the theater"" (i.e. the world of dramatic stage plays performed by skilled actors) disappeared, sadly.

The actors seen in The Witness For The Prosecution (1957) were mostly older actors trained before WWII in England at a time when ""the theater"" was still alive and well there, and actors were taught their trade with the expectation there would always be a place and need for good actor work on the stage.

This expectation was never the case with the movies. Movies don't depend on good actors the way the stage always did, just as movies don't depend on good writing which isn't needed for ""good box office"" due in part to the low tastes of many younger moviegoers whose money supports the movie industry. The young audience can be served video game type light shows with no need for a logical, dramatic, or culturally meaningful script...sad but true.

464360,5,6302413435,"Via Agatha Christie, this is arguably the greatest courtroom drama ever captured on film. A man (Tyrone power) is accused of murder and defended by barrister Laughton. Wife Marlene Dietrich should be providing him with an alibi, but instead appears as a witness for the prosecution. To reveal any more would be a crime in itself. Wilder's brilliant direction maintains the tension superbly while bringing out the best in all his actors. Power has his best role and Dietrich, who was always more of a personality than actress (at least whenever she worked with an director other than von Sternberg) gives her finest performance. Lanchester provides some wonderful comic relief, but towering above it all is Laughton's magnificent performance, dominating every scene he is in. Without a doubt, a film not to be missed.",1347235200,,816,5.097014925373134
464361,5,6302413435,"- ""Touching, isn't it? The way he counts on his wife.""
- ""Yes, like a drowning man clutching at a razor blade.""

Tyrone Power was 43 years old when he acted in WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, a dynamic 1957 courtroom whodunit which proved to be his final completed film. Not too long after, Ty Power would suffer a fatal heart attack while shooting a scene with George Sanders for the upcoming sword & sandal drama SOLOMON AND SHEBA. But if one were looking to put a cap on a heck of a cinematic career, then WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION will do nicely, thanks ever much. Ty Power goes out on top.

The high-powered cast doesn't let you down. We're treated to three powerhouse performances. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION boasts Billy Wilder as its director and as screenplay co-writer, this screenplay, by the way, adapted from Agatha Christie's stage play. Charles Laughton is magnificent, his patented bombast put perfectly to use. He plays Sir Wilfrid Robarts, London's preeminent barrister but one who is also a convalescing cardiac patient. As such Sir Wilfrid is banned by his physician from undertaking criminal cases. But when a murder case is brought to his doorstep - something about a middle-aged widow whose head had been bashed in - Sir Wilfrid sees something likable in the accused, Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), and so decides to defend him in the upcoming trial, his health be damned. He promptly steps into a viper's pit.

Ty Power wasn't the first actor to be offered his role, except that other leadings stars like William Holden and Kirk Douglas were already neck deep shooting in other films. And who knows how Holden or Douglas would've interpreted the part of Vole. But they would've had to work hard to match Power's magnetic presence here. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION would've been so much less had Power not been able to play his role so convincingly. If you assumed he was nothing beyond his swashbuckling roles, think it over. His Leonard Vole is equal parts shiftless and charismatic, a bit seedy but so ingratiating. When Sir Wilfrid makes up his mind to defend Vole, it's because he's persuaded of Vole's innocence, and Power had to really sell that quality.

This is inarguably one of the greatest courtroom dramas in cinema. There are so many twists and turns here that even pretzels may get whiplash. At the end of the film, there's even a voiceover that urges the movie audience to keep mum about the shocking climax. The ageless Marlene Dietrich should've probably been nominated for an Oscar, but the film studio execs were so determined to keep the film's big reveals on the hush that she wasn't properly promoted. Still, Dietrich submits a riveting performance as the accused's icy and calculating German wife.

Balancing the many taut moments are the comedic flourishes brought by Laughton and his real-life wife, Elsa Lanchester, who plays Sir Wilfrid's nagging personal nurse, Miss Plimsoll. It should be pointed out that their lighthearted interactions weren't drawn from Agatha Christie's original play, that they were instead written in by the screenplay writers. I thought that these scenes work remarkably well and went a ways in humanizing Sir Wilfrid. Sometimes, it could be a chore relating to the always mannered Charles Laughton. Did I mention how very good Laughton is in this one? It's a lot of fun watching him perform in the courthouse. When not in the courthouse, he tones down the theatrics, except that Charles Laughton is nothing if not always on. Even his subdued moments carry flash. This is one of his best roles, and one of his most sympathetic. In fact, no one sucks here.",1346025600,,3630,4.867313915857605

464363,4,6302413435,"I hereby congratulate all the friends who have mentioned this movie without spoiling the ending for me. I will attempt to do the same here, in case there's anyone even slower than me to see it.

The man accused of murder is played by Tyrone Power, his defense attorney is Charles Laughton, and his wife -- the title role -- is Marlene Dietrich. You will NOT guess how it comes out.

Leonard Vole met Christine while he was in the Army stationed in Germany and she was singing in a rather seedy cabaret. He fell in love with her (not to mention falling into bed with her), married her and brought her back to London with him after the war.

Vole is charged with the murder of a silly old widow he had befriended, and who rewrote her will to leave him the bulk of her estate. Sir Wilfrid has recently had a heart attack and has just come home in the charge of an over-protective nurse (Elsa Lanchester, who was Laughton's wife) when he is persuaded to defend Vole. Sir Wilfrid meets Vole's wife Christine, and decides she makes an unconvincing witness for the defense. She turns out to be quite a bit more convincing as a witness for the prosecution.

The title gave you that much, but how the courtroom drama plays out is the heart of the matter. And I would be far less fair than my closed-mouth friends if I gave that away. Just remember the story was written by Agatha Christie, and don't be taken in by all the twists and turns of the plot.

Power is slick, handsome, and though he appears too old to always be called 'young man' by his lawyer, he's very good. Laughton is the real star of the show and gives an outstanding performance full of wit and passion. He was rightly nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.  His scenes with Elsa Lanchester are quite funny. Dietrich is mysterious until the very end, the epitome of an icy, cool, and calculating female. This is a very British story, with most of the action set in a courtroom. The dialogue is spirited and the pace is quick.

464424,5,6302413435,"I love Billy Wilder.  He was such a powerful filmmaker who understood all sorts of genres and how to mold them into his signature style, creating films that are still so genuine and entertaining today.  His comedic timing is probably what he is best known for, since films like `The Apartment' and `Some Like It Hot' are considered masterpieces and probably the first films you think of when you hear his name.  But, Wilder was also very adept at creating stirring dramatic fare.

`Sunset Blvd.' anyone.

That brings me to `Witness for the Prosecution', a beautifully crafted courtroom drama starring Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and a ravishing Marlene Dietrich.  Adapted from an Agatha Christie play, `Witness for the Prosecution' tells the story of a London barrister preparing to retire when he gets sucked back into the game by an intriguing case he can't pass up.  Charged with the murder of a rich widow, Leonard Vole needs the best to prove his innocence.  His wife, Christine, may be his only hope, but shockingly she has other plans.

Dark, moody and intense, Wilder brings so much passion to this film.  He also directs his cast to stunning results.  Laughton is superb (thus, the Oscar nomination) and Power is convincing, but it is Dietrich who steals this whole movie with her cold stare and determined ambiguity.

Wilder is mostly remembered for his comedies. But this film proves he was adept at drama, too. And his talent for comedy and snappy dialogue gives this courtroom thriller some nice touches of humor, mostly from the curmudgeonly lead played by Laughton, but also through the governess played by Laughton's real-life wife, Elsa Lanchester ( the grouchy old maid is pretty entertaining, too).

This movie is just working on all cylinders from start to finish: great cast with solid perfomances from the leads and the supporting actors, a fast-paced script adapted by Wilder from Agatha Christie's play, and Wilders direction which adds a light tone to a murder mystery played out in a courtroom.

is nearly perfect, except for the casting of Marlene Dietrich  as
leonard Voile's wife. It's near impossible imagining Tyrone Power married to
someone as plain, or outright ugly, as Marlene. In addition, Marlene is
a very poor actress and brings the film's quality  down whenever onscreen.
Power died just weeks after this film was completed and it certainly is his
finest work. His casting was perfect, as was Laughton and John Williams.
Lanchester (who was Laughton's wife at the time) was also capable, although
she tended to overdo her role as keeper of Sir Wilfred's health. But, of course,
the distinction of this story lies at the ending, or actually after the courtroom
trial ends. I would never reveal this matter, as it would totally destroy any new
viewer's enjoyment of the conclusion, and that's what this story is all about.

While it is understandable that a movie is different from a play, this one changes much of the fundamental focus of the original drama, making it more about the defense lawyer than about the cunning con artist he is defending. In so doing, it becomes more Billy Wilder Hollywood than Agatha Christie theater.

The interaction between Charles Laughton and his real life wife, Elsa Lanchester, as the aging, hypertensive defense attorney and his nurse, is hilarious and not to be missed!  They steal the show.  There is plot twist after plot twist, and after you think you have it all figured out the plot twists yet again.  And again, right up until the closing credits.

Leonard's wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich) is his alibi, but she's not very believable when she talks to Sir Wilfrid, and indeed she ends up as a witness for the prosecution.

Even though I knew the plot, including the twists and turns, from reading Witness in Death, the movie itself was more than just the sum of its parts. The drama of whodunit and how and why was interspersed with humor, much of it coming from interactions between Sir Wilfrid and his nurse (Elsa Lanchester, who I remembered from Mary Poppins and That Darn Cat).

464610,5,6302413435,"A labyrinth of deception is expected in an Agatha Christie mystery, and those unfamiliar with Billy Wilder's 1957 adaptation of the venerable writer's classic courtroom drama are in for a treat. Even if you already know how it all ends, there are still joys to be had from the star-studded cast and the master filmmaker's craftsmanship. Along with fellow screenwriters Larry Marcus and Harry Kurnitz, Wilder has imbued Christie's absorbing story with enough of his trademark humor to make the compelling film a genuine entertainment in the old Hollywood tradition. The plot centers on master barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who decides to take as a client Leonard Vole, an unemployed kitchen-gadget inventor who is charged with murder. Robarts is in ill health and must tolerate the constant pestering of Miss Plimsoll, a nurse assigned to make sure Robarts slows down and takes his medications. Through a trick he employs by having sunlight reflect on his monocle, Robarts believes Vole to be innocent of the charge of killing wealthy, lonely matron Mrs. French. Naturally, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that points to Vole being the killer.

Enter Vole's cold German wife Christine, a former wartime chanteuse several years older than her husband and now his only alibi the night of the murder. The first surprising twist in the story occurs when Christine ends up playing the title role and kick-starts a series of revelations that lead to its somewhat unexpected conclusion. As Robarts, Charles Laughton has the best movie role of the latter phase of his lengthy career, displaying the character's sharp wit and cunning deductive skills with aplomb. His real-life wife Elsa Lanchester plays Miss Plimsoll with her familiar dotty manner and sing-song dithering. In his last completed role, Tyrone Power capitalizes on his seemingly effortless charm to play Vole but unfortunately tends to overact during key moments. Marlene Dietrich is ideally cast as the morally ambiguous Christine, showing off her legs in a wartime flashback and playing quite against character in the train station scene. You may be amused by a voiceover during the end credits that asks viewers not to reveal the surprise ending. A long trailer featuring Laughton is the only extra that comes with the 2001 DVD.",1220313600,,2298,5.160857908847185
464611,5,6302413435,"Though Thomas Wolfe advised against it, sometime heading home is a good thing. And what creates home more than those films you saw during your formative years? My first Marx Brothers, my first time with Bogart, my first gigantic plot twist all clank around in my brain even now.  Sometimes, as with The Ipcress File, a return visit is massively disappointing. Sometimes though, a trip back is more exciting than imagined. Such a trip is Witness for the Prosecution, a film I loved when I first saw it, probably on TV way back when, and a film that looks even better today, especially in this lovely print.

How could anyone dislike this film? While others here praise Power and Dietrich, I find their performances somewhat stilted and artificial. The plot conclusion muddies those waters, but they do not carry this tale. I'm happy to be in the minority, as they cannot sink this battleship. While Billy Wilder makes a wonderful captain, steering and choosing and selecting with a deftness not often seen, it is Charles Laughton, in what is certainly one of the finest performances on screen, who elevates this tale from the mere plot-driven supriseroo (like Ten Little Indians) to the realm of classics. He is extraordinary, moving from condescending, arrogant, sneering, scowling, and cranky, to overwhelmed with his own ignorance and staggered by how badly he is mistaken. Breathtaking in the smallest mannerisms and slightest vocal inflections. Elsa Lanchester, who often played the dithering wacko, is the perfect blend of subservience and skill. The supporting cast is all excellent. Familiar faces from a hundred films walk in, do a great job, and depart. But watching the aging Laughton, a man who no one could have seen as a box office draw, triumph, is a treat.

464694,5,6302413435,"If I could remember who suggested I watch this film, I'd thank them publicly here. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is one of the funniest and most fascinating stories I have watched. Leave it to Billy Wilder and Agatha Christie to concoct a story that'd keep viewers on the edges of their seats.

Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) is known as the 'champion of lost causes.' He's the barrister's barrister and the fox.  He's also just recovering from a heart attack. The old curmudgeon is also stuck with a nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster), who continously talks babytalk to him.

""Just roll up your mouth, you talk too much. If I'd known how much you talk I'd never have come out of my coma,"" he tells her--and worse.

Doctors have ordered Sir Wilfrid to rest, stop smoking, drinking, and only try civil suits. When he hears about the case where gigolo Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is accused of killing Emily Jane French a wealthy older woman, he cannot resist to try the case.

Everything's going well til Christine Helm-Vole (Marlena Dietrich) takes the stand and unbeknowst to Sir Wilfred beforehand testifies for the prosecution.

Can the old fox still get his client off?  This story has more twists than a pretzel factory. The dialog, particularly Sir Wilfrid's, is some of the best I have heard. The end literally had me up and out of my seat.

My only reason for a half-star deduction is because the black and white rendering on the DVD is very dark and makes it occasionally difficult to view without doing some contrast adjustments.

TP was the last known person to see the demised alive, has a shaky alibi-and is in the lady's will for big bucks! TP turns in desperation to big shot London lawyer Charles Laughton. In fact, Scotland Yard busts him in CL's office! Most have already commented on the lively courtroom drama but this reviewer admired the out of court sparring too as Laughton and his colleagues prepare for trial. Just out of the hospital, CL is perfect as the curmudgeonly and crafty barrister, even if he does tear up most of his scenes. His tart banter with his nurse (Elsa Lanchester) is softened by the knowledge that she was his real life wife. There are at least 3 huge plot twists to WFP, leading this observer to write a concise review in the interests of not divulging the ending. That leads us to female lead Marlene Dietrich: She is central to those twists- watch her closely! MD played 30 movies from 1930-1965; was she ever better than here? Hollywood took notice of WFP: It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Laughton) and Best Supporting Actress (Lanchester), though winning none. Dietrich was ignored by the Academy but nominated for Best Actress by the Golden Globes. How many times were husband and wife nominated together? WFP is filmed is beautiful black and white-a lost art-and features true economy of sets, perhaps reflecting its' stage origins.

464699,5,6302413435,"Witness for the Prosecution is an outstanding film with a number of great performances.  I've seen some criticism of Tyrone Power but I can't agree.  Far from wooden, he alternates between suave man-about-town and frantic defendant depending on the scene.  Marlene Dietrich is also very compelling as his wife although I'm not sure I see her appeal as a sex-symbol which she used to enjoy.  By far the best role, however, belongs to Charles Laughton as the defense attorney (or barrister) and he nails it beyond belief.  His character is a classic curmudgeon but he plays it with such charm and humor that he is one of my favorite characters of all time from any movie.

464701,5,6302413435,"Dietrich never had much good to say about this film; she didn't like the set, thought Power inadequate and was generally turned off by it.  I think probably she was disappointed that the public didn't respond with the praise she felt she deserved, in her ""transformation"" scene.  We can look back on it now and see that she did a good, professional job.  But then, that's what makes this courtroom whodunnit drama so fine: the high level of performance by all the actors involved.  You can count them all one by one: Agatha Christie for the story; Billy Wilder for at least half the screenplay; Charles Laughton in one of his best roles and supported by his wife the excellent comedienne Elsa Lanchester; the best English character actors in the business, and Dietrich in probably her least sympathetic -- and therefore most remarkable -- performance.  As to Tyrone Power? He played the part of an ex-RAF guy, drifting from job to job and mostly living off his wife; a sleaze-ball seller of novelty egg-beaters, door-to-door who preys on lonely women.  In other words, the kind of guy who could only get by on his looks.  Power had much more than his looks to get by on, and here, the rest is acting.  Marlene probably just had somebody else in mind for the role of Lawrence Vole.

This play was a hit for a very long time for Patricia Jessel, in London, and one can only imagine the intrigue Dietrich must have resorted to to get the role for herself.  Billy Wilder's wife is reported to have called Dietrich ""a whore,"" (how many Hollywood wives must have said the same?)but in all probability it was only because both Marlene and Billy came out of Pre-War Berlin and Vienna and as expatriates spent a great deal of time talking intimately about the project, in German.  After von Sternberg, Dietrich considered herself not merely an actress and star, but a participant in the artistic creation of the enterprise.  Probably it was their artistic intimacy (and their understanding about sexuality) that produced A FOREIGN AFFAIR too.  But this film is remarkable in two telling ways; it is witty not just in dialogue, but in camera use, and most of all, in pace.  Unlike many English films of the period, the story is told with terrific speed.  A sense of urgency permeates the story.  The surface of WITNESS crackles with a dry, ironic electrical tension.  They really don't make movies like this anymore.  They can't.",1172966400,39,2419,4.719047619047619
464702,5,6302413435,"This 1957 classic is usually billed as a courtroom drama, but like most Billy Wilder films, it's also a comedy, full of witty dialogue, and Charles Laughton, Elsa Lanchester, and Una O'Connor provide ample humor. (I'm assuming the Agatha Christie play on which the movie is based was equally witty.) This is one of those captivating movies that make you appreciate the OLD Hollywood, an incredible team effort that did the old studio system proud.

The last time I saw this, I was conscious of how cleverly sex was conveyed in old movies. In the scene where Tyrone Power meets Marlene Dietrich, they are oozing sex out of every pore, but because this was 1957, it had to be slyly hinted at instead of blatant.  Call me old-fashioned, but I think it's better for the subtlety.

Although Tyrone Power (a rather wooden leading man) got top billing in this, Dietrich and Laughton (as the almost-retired defense lawyer) get all the good scenes, especially in the courtroom. In our health-obsessed age, it's fun watching Laughton do end-runs around his fussy nurse (Lanchester) in order to keep himself supplied with cigars and brandy. They come to a meeting of minds at the film's end, but I'll say no more abou that. The tomfoolery makes a nice contrast with the stiffness of the English lawyers in their wigs.

I wouldn't dream of giving away the ending of this, but will say it is one of the best twist (really, double twist) endings of any movie ever made, also providing that sense of moral rightness that makes fans of murder mysteries and courtroom dramas sigh with satisfaction.",1172361600,10,1581,4.78021978021978

464778,5,6302413435,"This film is a remarkable, unforgettable work of art in so many ways. Director Billy Wilder and a brilliant cast of actors gave ""Witness for the Prosecution"" every element of a superb movie. The film is a highly suspenseful courtroom drama, saturated with plot twists and surprises which do not let up until the very end. I have never seen another movie in which the element of suspense is so brilliantly done-the plot twists leave the viewer captivated and perplexed until all the loose ends come together in the film's unforgettable climax. Aside from the drama, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" has numerous bits of comedy interspersed throughout the storyline, which complement the film's enjoyability very much and do not in any way detract from its dramatic impact. The performances of the actors and their interaction with each other are done flawlessly. Charles Laughton leads the cast, starring in one of his last film roles as Sir Wilfrid Robarts, a crotchety old English barrister, who agrees to defend Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Power, who also died shortly after the film was made) on a charge of murder. The case against Vole seems open-and-shut, as even his own wife (played by Marlene Dietrich) agrees to testify against him. But as we learn in the course of the film, there is much more to Leonard Vole and his wife Christine than first meets the eye, and just when you think you know how the story will end, the plot veers off in a new direction and the viewer is kept guessing until the final credits roll. For quality of acting, a great storyline, suspense, and great entertainment value, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" simply can't be beat. Every element of a great film is present here in abundance. Suffice it to say that, in my humble opinion, this movie represents the pinnacle of filmmaking, and was never surpassed before or since.

Charles Laughton is brilliant as the ailing,older defense attorney and Elsa Lancaster provides comic relief as his nurse that is miraculously not annoying.  I did wonder how Tyrone Power could play a British citizen with such an obvious American accent.  I'm surprised they didn't provide a back story that he was an American living in England instead of  trying to pass him off as a native.  Marlene Dietrich (in her mid 50's but still charismatic) is really not in the movie  that much but she makes a real impact when she does appear and of course her genuine German accent fits right in to her part.  There are no extras to speak of on the DVD and close captioning is not in English just French and Spanish which I always find disappointing but the accents are not difficult to follow.",1154304000,6,972,4.514285714285714

The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power's character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.

Otherwise, it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich.

Laughton, who plays Power's defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.

Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton's nurse. She, too, demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.

464855,5,6302413435,"As strongly advised by the narrator in the movie, we viewers are not to disclose the ending of the plot. And you'll be guaranteed a big twist and surprise that is beyond your imagination!

Charles Laughton is the renowned persistent barrister with an even more persistent nurse and watchful housekeeper. He, against the advice of his doctor and his nurse, acted as the defence lawyer in an apparently hopeless to win trial. Tyrone Power was the accused murderer with a beautiful foreigner wife Marlene Dietrich. The time was a few years after the World War II ended and the place London when the public was still at large unsympathetic to Germans.

The three stars acted superbly with impeccable lines. To top it all, the movie is given an ending that is wonderful, unexpected and at the same time serves the justice well. It can only be said that the punishment fits the crime and human nature (or weaknesses and prejudices, to be more specific) as portrayed in the movie is still highly relevant nowadays. To me, this is the most intriguing work by Agatha Christie.

This movie can hardly be remade and deliver as much impact. There simply is not another trio who could play against each other so well. The conversations when Charles Laughton first inquired of the testimony of the husband and wife, separately, at his apartment were already as exciting as the subsequent court room drama. Credits must also be given to the director Billy Wilder (Sabrina, the Apartment, Some Like It Hot) who was a master of portraying characters, dialogues, wit and detail. No one could impress more than Marlene Dietrich as the intelligent wife with an unmistakable German accent. There is also a rare scene of her showing her legs. Tyrone Power grabbed the audience's attention with his plea for his innocence. And Charles Laughton is Charles Laughton - a big boy who pursued the case, as well as indulged himself in a few drinks and cigars, ferociously and fervantly. He is also the brain of the movie and the truth first dawned on him only till the end.

It might also interest you that the nurse, Elsa Lanchester starred in the Bride of Frankestein and played as Charles Laughton's wife, Anne of Cleves, in the Private Life of Henry VIII. Another barrister in the movie, John Williams, actually assumed the role of Audrey Hepburn's father in Sabrina.

The trial builds up to an acquittal, but the real action occurs during the last 10 minutes AFTER the trial, when we witness a cross, then a double cross, and then a triple cross!

Laughton is superb (it's one of his best performances after his role as the Hunchback of Notre Dame), as is Dietrich, though there have been more powerful courtroom dramas produced for the screen than this one. As the end credits were shown, audiences were asked not to reveal the ending to others, and indeed the whole picture seems merely a prelude to that 10-minute ending.",1131235200,,749,4.8062015503875966
464858,5,6302413435,"I, myself, am not a fan of Agatha Christie's or of any of her followers; I rarely find the strength to keep up with all the clues and the various witnesses, lawyers, cross-examinations and objections which all lead up to the inevitable conclusion that, well, The Butler Did It. I can certainly understand the appeal in this kind of puzzle-movie; it just never appealed to me. To me the main problem with this kind of stories is that usually, more emphasis is put on the clues than on the characters - and so, when the real murderer is finally revealed, I say: ""well, how about that?"" - I simply don't care.

But in every genre there are always some creations that transcend the genre. Witness for the Prosecution stands as a true masterpiece among the Whodunit murder mysteries, one that will be pure ecstasy to fans of the genre, but is also a fantastic creation on any level and in any standard. This one proves just my point, that a clever story with a lot of characters and a lot of clues and misguiding clues just isn't enough; Christie's play is masterful, of course, and the twist at the end is one of the great classic shockers of cinema, one that matches modern classics like The Usual Suspects and Memento, if not transcends them; but it took more than the story to make that ending work. The reason it all works so well is because the characters are so captivating. That is thanks to two elements - first, Billy Wilder's (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd., The Seven Year Itch) masterful direction, and an ensemble of fantastic actors, all of whom bring their characters to life; Charles Laughton is beyond brilliant as the aging, ailing, wily solicitor, and Tyrone Power is electrifying and fascinating as his client. Most of all the diva Marlene Dietrich grants a truly show-stopping performance, and steals the show from the rest of the cast - proving just how great she really was.

By far the greatest trial drama ever made, and one of the greatest murder mysteries, it took the combined talents of Christie, Wilder and the fantastic cast to create such amazing drama in the courtroom alone; Witness for the Prosecution is basically an ensemble piece that is no more than a theatre production, but Wilder uses the full powers that he has at his disposal as a film director - close-ups, music, cinematography, lighting - to their full potential; and thus once again it is proven that he is one of the most underrated directors in history. This is a classic that deserves to be remembered with the very best films of all time.",1130371200,7,2537,4.623059866962306
464859,5,6302413435,"Seriously one of the great courtroom dramas of all time.  A taut, unpredictable mystery...one of Agatha Christie's finest twists, and she was the master of the unguessable ending.  Accompanied by terrific characters (all colorful and over the top, but highly entertaining) played to the hilt by some truly fine actors, many of whom were reaching the ends of their serious careers (Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power) but were also at the very top of their games.

I won't trouble you with all the details of the plot.  It's a seemingly simple murder mystery / courtroom drama that just gets more and more complex as the layers of the plot are peeled away.  If you want a movie with deep, realistic characterizations...this is not it.  If you want vivid, larger-than-life people engaged in a series of high-stakes cat-and-mouse games, you'll be very satisfied.

Yes, the movie is nearly 50 years old, but it has aged unbelievably well.  The direction is spot-on from the peerless Billy Wilder.  His filmmaking is so clean and unpretentious, and yet powerfully effective.  He knows when to use the closeup, when to pan back.  They are technically unremarkable...except it is so difficult to make a movie this unobtrusive in its artistry, that I admire Wilder for that ability.

Charles Laughton, as the attorney hired to represent murder suspect Tyrone Power, has NEVER been better.  He might have gained more awards for his HENRY VIII and more lasting fame for HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME...but this character has it all.  Bombast, cynicism, a real heart, great intelligence and a desert-dry wit.  If his were the only memorable turn in the film, it would be enough to recommend it.

But you've got to see the legendary Marlene Dietrich.  She's past her height as a sex-symbol, but instead we get a rich performance that musters all her hard-won lessons over the decades.  If anyone ever thought she was just a charismatic figure...they need to see this.  She has charisma to burn, true, but skill as  well.  Tyrone Power is a dashing scoundrel, who may or may not be a murderer, and he is well-suited to the role...he's a mix of tough guy and romantic lead.  Elsa Lancaster has a small role as Laughton's assistant, and she's simply a hoot.  Throughout the film are many other recognizable British character actors of the `40s and `50s.  It's a top-notch production from beginning to end.

And the ending is a doozy as well.  When the final twist is revealed, we're left to marvel at Agatha Christie's skills.  As a youth, I read all her books (literally all) and I can say this:  Agatha Christie may not have had the best writing skills (serviceable but not exactly Nobel Prize material) but her ability to craft an amazing and yet credible plot twist was and is unsurpassed.  Much of her work has been imitated over the decades.  Many of her twists still show up on everything from Murder She Wrote to CSI.  But she consistently came up with great ending after great ending.  For nearly 90 novels, and countless short stories.  And WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (based very closely on her stage play, which she based on a short story of hers) has one of her better twists.

I can't recommend this movie highly enough!",1128902400,4,3227,4.807272727272728

The irascible Sir Wilfrid has just returned home after a two month convalescence following a heart attack.  He arrives attached at the hip with nurse Miss Plimsoll played by a chatty Elsa Lanchester. Sir Wilfrid has been prohibited from drinking, smoking and practicing law in any stressful high profile cases.

Laughton is visited by a solicitor friend seeking advice in a case involving Tyrone Power playing sketchy playboy type, Leonard Vole.  Vole has been implicated in the bludgeoning death of an elderly and wealthy widow Emily Jane French.  The married Vole had been wooing the widow hoping for financial backing for his invention.  Initially Laughton's inclination is to follow doctor's orders and refer the case to his trusted associate played by John Williams.  After interviewing Power, he is intrigued convinced of his innocence and decides to take the case.  His contention that Power has no motive for the killing is dashed when he discovers that the widow has left him 80,000 pounds.

Power's only alibi is the testimony of his German born actress wife Christine played by Marlene Dietrich, that he was home at the established time of the murder.  Laughton questions Dietrich and learns that her marriage to Power is illegal and that she is actually a bigamist, being already married,  Her cool demeanor and abrasive personality forces him to dismiss her as a potential witness for the defense.

In the courtroom, compelling circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecutor, English character actor Torin Thatcher makes things look grim for Power.  Much to the surprise of Laughton and his associate Mr. Brogan-Moore, Dietrich is called as a witness for the prosecution.  She skewers Power by failing to corroborate his alibi, dooming him.

Miraculously, later that evening, the night before the closing arguments, Laughton is tipped off to the presence of incriminating letters written by Dietrich which will exonerate Power and cast suspicion on her.  With letters in hand, Laughton tears apart Dietrich on the witness stand and everyone now anxiously awaits the verdict.

The verdict, however doesn't signal the end of the Agatha Christie inspired flick, as numerous plot twists at the conclusion enhance the reputation of this film as a timeless classic.",1117756800,8,2447,5.2979274611398965

464922,3,6302413435,"I agree that this movie is a prototype for countless future courtroom dramas, but that said, it wasn't too terribly exciting.
Marlene Deitrich- icon at large- has always been a bit creepy to me- she's so cold- even when she's not supposed to be & don't get me started on her singing!
I still like to watch films she stars in, because I believe one day I'll crack & understand what made her deeply sought after.
If I had seen this in 1957, I'm sure I would have ooohed & aaahed at the twists aplenty, but they were lackluster in comparison to the many mystery books & movies I've read & seen.
Most of it takes place in the courtroom- so I found I could just listen to it in the background without really paying attention to the screen.
If you're interested in watching a film that helped make courtroom dramas what they are today, then you should check it out.  I'm glad I watched it.  Just don't expect to be thrilled beyond compare.",1080345600,8,933,4.35632183908046
464923,4,6302413435,"When I first saw this movie as a teenager I loved the courtroom drama and attendant plot twists.  But Wilder also has a rare genius for creating fully-fledged comic characters with a few deft, witty lines, and that's what delights me now.  Charles Laughton is hilarious as the acerbic barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, battling with a fussy nurse, a cranky elderly witness, and a sarcastic judge, and the film has several laugh-out-loud moments.  I still think the plot is entertaining, but it does have some mighty creaky sections.  The screenplay is based on a short story and play by Agatha Christie, and Christie's plot twists are perhaps more notable for their ingenuity than their plausibility.  Incidentally, the short story has a different and to me preferable ending.
It's true that Tyrone Powers is pretty hard to watch, but that's not all his fault -- he's given some terrible lines to work with, and after the past decade of seeing stony-faced defendents on Court TV, it seems crazy when Powers starts emoting all over the courtroom.  As for Dietrich, her performance varies wildly.  At times such as the flashback scene to Germany, she's very naturalistic -- interesting, even fascinating to watch.  At other times, you can almost hear Wilder yelling through a megaphone, ""Now let's see some ACTING"", and Dietrich, like the British soldiers in the trenches of Ypres, goes bravely over the top.
Overall, however, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is great.  Itt belongs to the set of films that I will always stop and watch while flipping through the cable channels late at night.",1070582400,3,1585,4.973484848484849

Laughton plays a lawyer who is ordered to ""bed rest"" by his doctor.  Upon returning from the hospital, Laughton's character is confronted with an puzzling criminal defense case of an ""inventor"" who is charged with the murder of a rich elderly lady he has befriended. The courtroom scenes are fantastic and filled with tense moments, high-styled drama, and tremendous twists and turns.  This is one of my favorite ""black and whites"".

464925,4,6302413435,"A highlight in Billy Wilder's impressive oeuvre. The story hinges on the abilities of Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power to tell two different stories with equal conviction. Their performances and the story are anchored by the fussy, but brilliant barrister played by Charles Laughton. Wilder does an excellent job weaving the story without telegraphing the plot twists that accompany an Agatha Christie mystery. The only fault I find with the film is the pacing. The movie takes a little long to get started, how the defendant met his wife is not really important to the story. Then the ending concludes incredibly quickly. Followed a year later by ""Anatomy of a Murder"" these two classics can hold their own against any recent court room drama without needing any special forgiveness from the audience for their age.",1051920000,6,817,5.059259259259259
464926,3,6302413435,"Part of the problem with MGM DVD releases of late is that they weren't the studio responsible for producing the original feature film.  Their disinterest shows.  Most MGM DVD's have been mastered (and I use the term loosely) from second, third or fourth generation prints instead of original camera negatives.  Many are bare bones in the way of extra features and almost all of the newly released classic line of catalogue titles don't even come with a color insert that lists chapter breaks.  ""Witness for the Prosecution"" can bear witness to all of the above.
Basically, this is an overdone courtroom drama - think of an episode of ""Law and Order"" transported to a British locale and stretched to feature length running time and that's basically the idea behind this movie. Charles Laughton is a barrister defending Tyrone Power, who is accused of killing his employer one stormy night.  There's plenty of melodrama and some really bad acting by Marlene Dietrich in the second half as she tries to impersonate a cockney waif in order to throw Laughton off course.  The one salvation of the film is Laughton's performance - it's brilliant!
As pure cinema, this movie would play as moderately entertaining if it weren't for the fact that MGM has once again given us the short end of the stick.  A non-anamorphic print, riddled with aliasing, edge enhancement and pixelization.  The gray scale is rendered properly (a small comfort)and the audio is amply provided for (another small comfort) but we basically get a forty year old print that's been run through the projector once too often and presented for us with no attempt to clean up the original camera negative before rushing things out to DVD.  Of course there are no extras.  From a studio that can't even give you a slip of paper inside to tell you how many chapter breaks there are - was there ever any doubt about extra features?!?",1049587200,30,1891,4.808641975308642
464927,5,6302413435,"Elsa Lanchester is brilliant as the nurse for the acerbic barrister, newly home from the hospital after suffering a heart attack; nevertheless, he continues to smoke cigars and drink brandy whenever he can be skillful enough to hide them from the ever watchful Miss Plimsill (Lanchester). Tyrone Power is superb as the charming, disingenuous ne'er-do-well, unable to settle down after the War, and inventing egg beaters that beat AND separate the yolk from the white, and other dubious household necessities. Marlene Dietrich makes a Grand Entrance, and promptly puzzles Sir Wilfrid beyond speech, with her apparent cool, collected behaviour upon hearing her husband is going to be charged with the murder of Emily French, a rich older widow befriended by Power when he assisted her in the selection of a hat. The trial is the real action and centerpiece of the movie. but I enjoyed the byplay between Sir Wilfrid and Miss Plimsill even more...upon emerging from the car when he first comes home, Miss Plimsill reminds him to ""Take teeny weeny steps, Sir Wilfrid, remember, we had a teeny weeny heart attack..."" to which he replies: ""Oh shut up."" And his threats (after she confiscates some cigars he was smuggling in his cane) ""I'll do it some dark night when her back is turned; I'll plunge her thermometer between her shoulder blades..."" There are many unexpected twists here, and the ending is a real shocker, a complete surprise, and quite satisfying. Great performances by an exceptional cast, and as always, IMHO, Laughton steals the show.",1048118400,63,1546,5.04296875
465008,5,6302413435,"Billy Wilder had a well trained eye for a story.  The director co-adapted with Harry Kurnitz the successful stage drama ""Witness for the Prosecution"" by Agatha Christie to the screen with brilliant results, keeping audience members wondering to fadeout.  Recognizing he had a spellbinder, director Wilder inserted a message in the closing credits requesting that audience members not divulge the film's ending.
Charles Laughton gives perhaps his finest film performance along with the highly saluted ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" as a garrulous British barrister who, after a near fatal heart attack, returns to work with the injunction to take things easy.  He quickly defies the ardent medical request by becoming involved in the murder trial of Tyrone Power, an American living in London who is accused of murdering wealthy heiress Norma Varden for her money.  He also spurns the efforts of faithful nurse Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's wife in real life, to take daily naps and refrain from drinking.  He puts brandy into a thermos jug purportedly containing hot chocolate.
While Laughton skillfully employs his bag of courtroom tricks in an effort to secure a not guilty verdict for Power, he experiences nagging concerns that there is something eluding him, that he does not see the case in totality and has failed to find a missing ingredient which would clarify everything.  His cross examination skills are brutally trained on Marlene Dietrich, who announces that her presumed marriage to Power is not legal and she will serve as a witness for the prosecution.  As the dramatic action see saws audience members wonder just who is the film's culprit.  Is it Power or Dietrich?  Is the skilled conniver one or the other?  Just who has been victimized in this complex relationship?
The swirling tide pool of emotional duplicity represents Wilder in his familiar orbit as master cynic, the same creative mind who stirred us up while watching ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""The Apartment"".  Sit back and allow yourself to be absorbed in the details and the superb plot twists.",1044144000,,2106,5.1647058823529415
465009,5,6302413435,"Quite probably, this film is the most ingeniously entertaining of all ""Courtroom"" dramas. At any rate, WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION will definitely please viewers who like movies with a ""twist"" ending! At the mellow age of 55, Marlene Dietrich seems peerless in her playing of Christine: this is more than likely her finest dramatic performance. As the weak-hearted (literally) Sir Wilfred, the gruff barrister, Charles Laughton is perfection and as his nurse, Miss Plimsoll, Elsa Lanchester is memorable: there is a genuine chemistry between the two, they being real-life spouses for 25 years. Tyrone Power is fine as Leonard Vole who gets his comeuppance in a most unexpected manner. Norma Varden does well in her role as the rich old woman whom Leonard charms. The actress is who plays the frumpy brunette Cockney streetwalker is a unique fascination...Directed by Billy Wilder and based upon the Agatha Christie story, this film really couldn't miss.

465010,5,6302413435,"What a great movie.  First of all, it's somewhat astonishing that this is a Billy Wilder film.  The only thing it has in common with his other classics like ""The Apartment,"" ""Sunset Boulevard,"" or ""Some Like it Hot"" is its intelligence and sophistication.  Otherwise, it is an entirely different kind of experience--a courtroom drama, a twisty mystery, an excursion into what is most British, and a vehicle for great performances by Charles Laughton, Elsa Lanchester and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton is especially wonderful as a barrister with a bad heart, who duels throughout with his scornful, but ultimately devoted, nurse who tries vainly to keep him away from cigars and bad food.  Laughton survives this bodily assault, because in the end, he is shown to be essentially a servant of truth.  The cynicism of American jurisprudence is absent here--Laughton's character does not give into easy rationalizations about his role(and to say more would be unfair to those who haven't seen it.) Laughton strives for nobility.  And yet, despite the wig and the courtliness, he is very alive in this role.  I just loved this film.",1037577600,6,1124,5.076086956521739
465011,5,6302413435,"With a number of excellent reviews for this classic court-room film, there is not much for me to add. You expect Charles Laughton to be superb, and he doesn't let you down--this is another one of his great roles, and he attacks it with relish.
However, as another reviewer notes, the surprise here is Tyrone Power--his performance is low-key at first, but it builds to a shattering climax--he was much more than just a great-looking man. Sadly, this turned out to be his last film--he succumbed to a heart attack during his next film, ""Solomon and Sheba"" ( to be replaced by Yul Brynner ). However, with ""Witness for the Prosecution"", Mr. Power certainly went out ""on top"".
What else can you say about Billy Wilder--a great director at the top of his game !
This is one film where revealing too much of the plot would be unthinkable, and the finale is one of the great ""surprise endings"" in the history of the motion picture. In fact, in the 50s when this film was released, audiences were asked not to reveal the ending to their friends. I wonder how closely such ""advice"" would be followed today !? I remember when the ""secret"" in ""The Crying Game"" was spoiled for many viewers, even by film ""critics"". ( Late note dated 10 August 2003--well--guess what ? Some guy named ""Nick"" in Windsor, Ontario--who is not so impressed with the film--his privilege, of course--doesn't hesitate to spoil one of the film's key surprises for anyone who has yet to see it. It's like sitting in a movie theatre, and having someone talking behind you, telling you what's going to happen next--well done, Nick ! )
As for the DVD, for a 45 year old movie, the black and white picture is excellent. Highly recommended.",1031270400,,1698,4.625827814569536
465012,5,6302413435,"Although this film is filled with a bevy of excellent actors and actresses, and although he did play the part of Gracchus in SPARTACUS a couple of years later, and an excellent supporting role in ADVISE AND CONSENT a couple of years after that, this is the last truly great performance in the career of perhaps the greatest character actor film has seen. Charles Laughton was in no sense a leading man: obsese, unattractive, unathletic, awkward. He nonetheless managed to put together an astonishing career. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION was released in 1957, but until that moment, the 1950s had not been kind to Laughton, whose greatest success came in the 1930s and 1940s. He had directed the remarkable THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER in 1955, but his acting parts in the decade, apart from David Lean's HOBSON'S CHOICE, were for the most part undistinguished and not among the finest of his career. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is Laughton's glorious return and, because of declining health, last great role. If WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION had nothing else to recommend it, Laughton's performance would make it well, well worth seeing.
Luckily, this film has far more than Laughton to recommend it. Ironically, it was also the last great role for Tyrone Power, for whom WITNESS was also a part of a comeback (he also excelled in THE SUN ALSO RISES). I have to say, for anyone who had seen Power in films in the 1940s, his physical appearance in 1957 is shocking. Much like Errol Flynn, he had lived a hard life, and it shows. He would die of a heartattack a year after this performance, and looks much older than 43 years old. Nonetheless, the remarkable thing about Power is that while not a particularly great actor during the heyday of his career, when he looks carried him from role to role, near the end of his life he grew considerably as an actor. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is one of his better performances, by far. Unlike Laughton and Power, both aging and in poor health, but similar to both in that the 1950s had up to that point not been one of her most active decades, Marlene Dietrich appears barely to have aged since the 1930s. The kinds of parts she was best suited for were far too subversive for the staid 1950s. Her natural cynicism and sexuality were far too threatening at that time even for the darkest of film noir. So, WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION was something of a comeback (or the continuation of a comeback in the case of Power) for the three principles. The cast was rounded out by some stellar characters actors, including the always amazing Una O'Connor, the frequently villanous Henry Daniell (though not in this one), and John Williams (who had played Audrey Hepburn's chaffeur father in Wilder's SABRINA, playing Laughton's law partner in this one).
Unlike the three leads, Billy Wilder was not suffering from any kind of lull in his career when he made this film. He had, first as a screenwriter and then as a director, been marching from triumph to triumph for the previous twenty years, and would continue to do so for another ten years. The movie was untypical Wilder, however. Along with Preston Sturges, Wilder is arguably the greatest writer of comedy scripts in the history of film (he had cowriters, but their primary function was to correct his Germanicisms, to polish his rough English; Wilder supplied the ideas and action). In WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, however, although adapting an Agatha Christie original, and adding a huge number of Wilderian touches, he largely is working from someone else's work. Wilder virtually always wrote completely original stories.
A lot of people love the plot of this one, and especially the twists, but I have to say that I find this somewhat artificial, and some of the least appealing parts of the film. What I do delight in is the interplay between the various characters, the chemistry between the actors and actresses, the dozens of little touches and transitions that Wilder makes while working within the limitations of someone else's story.
But most of all, this film is great because Charles Laughton was able to find one last, great role before his career came to an end.",1030924800,113,4161,4.7885952712100135
465013,5,6302413435,"I have owned the VHS version of this film for several years and was delighted to purchase it in DVD.  If one has the choice, go for the DVD.  It's widescreen, the transfer is flawless, and the sound is better.  It's funny, but I enjoyed the VHS version for years until I saw how much better it became on DVD.  I had to cut the contrast on my television by a couple of notches to get the right tone of grays, as happens often with these B/W films.
This is indeed one of the best transfers of a Christie work to film.  Unlike so many of her books, there is no hidden clue or plot twist that leaves one feeling cheated at the end of the film.
It's the cast, of course, that makes the movie for us.  Laughton and Lanchester take to their parts like they were born for them, filling their roles with obvious relish and enjoyment.  It reminds us how liberating roles can be when the actors aren't young and trying to appear sexy!
Marlene Dietrich plays her part to near-perfection.  Considering she was 'way up in her fifties when this movie was made, she is effortless in her grace, if not also her beauty.  Who could play this part at that age in today's films?  No one I know.  Ms. Dietrich always knew her best wardrobe and lighting, and she uses it to great advantage here.
..., Tyrone Power has never seemed to fit so well with the rest of this cast.  I've always felt that he acted too 'young' for his part, for, like Ms. Dietrich, he is very obviously middle-aged, and not aging as well as she.  While still a handsome man, he seems a good ten years too old for his part.  He does his best, though, and certainly doesn't ruin the overall impression of the movie.
As the movie requests, I won't go into the plot or the surprise ending, leaving that for the viewer.  I will say that the courtroom scene is one of the best ever made re British courts, as enjoyable as that in ""QB VII"", being so different from our American system.
This is a movie to treasure and watch over again whenever one feels the need for a 'feel good' film with good guys and bad ones, too.  As always, we are so fortunate to be able to preserve these on digital media to enjoy for many years to come.",1029628800,8,2174,4.227602905569007
465014,5,6302413435,"Lawyers Charles Laughton and Henry Daniell get quite flustered when Marlene Dietrich hurls that line at them, after Laughton suggests that an older murdered woman doted on Dietrich's husband (and prime suspect) Tyrone Power as a son. The victim changed her will in his favor, you see, shortly before her murder and Power doesn't seem ever to have mentioned that he was a married man. He seems a likeable enough fellow, for all that, so Laughton decides to take the case, although as a heart patient he really ought to be resting. Well, at least his nurse Elsa Lanchester will do her part and coax and cajole him into compliance (or so she thinks). But when the prosecution shows up with a surprise witness, Laughton has to chew a lot of pills and use all his wits to try to secure an acquittal of his client.
""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a great story, and why wouldn't it be, since it stems from the mind of Agatha Christie herself. Everyone is turning in a top-notch performance; my only criticism concerns Mr. Power. It's much like my complaint against Richard Basehart in ""Moby-Dick""--too many pointed references to the youthfulness of the character when the man before us is obviously not a whippersnapper. The vanity implied  makes it a bit absurd, you see. Anyway, the extreme youth of Power's character isn't really the operative point; he's younger than the murder victim, and that's enough. The real firework displays come from Laughton and Dietrich. Both give Academy Award-calibre performances in their adversarial roles. Proof of the pudding is in the eating moment: During his first viewing of it, my generally hard-to-please brother calmly turned to us and said that it was the best movie he'd ever seen!
The verdict is in: You're to be taken to a VCR where you should see ""Witness for the Prosecution"" as soon as possible.",1028851200,3,1842,4.8107255520504735

This plot of this film, which was based on a play by Agatha Christie, is your basic courtroom drama: a series of witnesses testify about the murder of a wealthy widow.

This film has some terrific, very surprising, twists and turns, so to say any more about the plot would give too much away!

The Agatha Christie short story, on which this movie is based, is only 24 pages long and spends only 2 pages on the trial! The Charles Laughton character, Sir Charles, appears briefly with only a few lines. Billy Wilder wrote the screenplay and it expands a throw away Christie story into a powerful courtroom drama.

Laughton in general is great here--switching from faking frivolity to grave seriousness.  And Dietrich wonderful in this late time of her career; her legs are still amazing at that age.
But the real star of the film is Wilder's direction of the taut script.  A device that I love of his is that he includes details that seem to be incidental, but later turn out to be crucial information.  Only then does the viewer realize that they were supposed to notice them earlier.

Since this film is a combination of both, it's hardly a surprise I enjoyed it so much.  Tyrone Power is accused of murdering an older woman he was involved with, and it's up to barrister and heart patient Charles Laughton to defend him.  Power's best hope for help is his wife, Marlene Dietrich, while Laughton is forever being babied by his nurse, Elsa Lanchester.  There are a series of surprise revelations that take the viewer on a winding road to the truth, and the trip is a lot of fun.  The performances are all excellent.  Laughton gets to ham it up, and he does so with relish and style, while Power is surprisingly impassioned and convincing.  Both Dietrich and Lanchester give their usual quality performances, and it's fun to see an older Una O'Connor as the dead woman's maid.  O'Connor was a very distinctive character actress that added a lot of humour to many a film.

If you liked the corny humor of such duos as the two jokers in ""Stalag 17"" you won't mind her, but she didn't make me laugh even once.  In addition, the courtroom scenes are laughable as far as realism goes, which I can occaisonally handle, but this film went overboard.  Laughton's character should amaze us with his courtroom abilities, but instead Wilder just wrote a smattering of flowery lines for him to spout and allows him to steam through the trial nearly unopposed by the apparently incompetent prosecutor.

465081,5,6302413435,"This movie is incredible!  As a huge fan of Agatha Christie, I had no problem getting it...but when I saw it, I was still blown away!  This movie grabs you from beginning to end, and the final plot twists (there are several) make sure you never see the ending coming!  If you're a fan of the Hitchcock/Suspense genre, this is one you'll enjoy too!",985132800,,347,4.390625
465082,5,6302413435,"This is another example of the Dietrich brilliance. Dietrich is peerless as Christine Vole who is her husband's only chance of acquittal. Charles Laughton plays the barrister who defends her husband played by Tyrone Power. Elsa Lanchester is on hand as the barrister's nurse. The film was directed by Billy Wilder and it is based on the play by Agatha Christie. It grips you from the very beginning and it never releases its tenacious grasp. The film is a complicated blend of comedy, romance, courtroom drama, and murder mystery. Most importantly it has Marlene Dietrich.",972172800,4,572,5.031578947368421
