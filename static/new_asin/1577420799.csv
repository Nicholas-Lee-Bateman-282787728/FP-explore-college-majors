7799029,3,1577420799,"Family reunions are ghastly affairs. You meet relatives that you never
thought you had and indeed didn't want. Ah, but what can you do? Dear,
dear Bess comes across a relative only she can see. He's been dead for
a few centuries ( like five) and is determined to make a come back if
his little cousin will invite him into her world.
 Say hello to
Walter, a charming ghost with an old score to settle with some humans
who impoverished his family and is about to do the same to young
Bess's. Walter is not some run of the mill ghost but is Sir Walter
Raliegh, himself, explorer, would be pharmacist and pain in the
butt.
 Enjoy this little comedy as you see Walter mess things up for
Bess and cause havok throughout his visit. The acting is average and
the plot okay. My Friend Walter is a good view for a rainy day. Kids
and grownups alike will enjoy the affairs of this duo.",978220800,2,874,4.259036144578313
