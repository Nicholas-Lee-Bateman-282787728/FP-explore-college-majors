Having a good or even fairly good script would have been a big help.  Don't waist your money on this one!  Sorry Sonny!",1333065600,,261,4.0588235294117645
7935622,1,B00005ASOK,"I think it's great that older women can get leading roles in crime thrillers.  However, ""V.I. Warshawski"" did poorly decades ago and this movie does nothing to change that trend.

This movie substitutes rudeness for violence.  You never see people die; you only hear about it after the fact, and often.  Still, cops arrest the main character and they push her around when they could be civil.  A Chinese mafioso threatens violent acts upon her even though she shows him no disrespect.  She is hidden at a country woman's house and the woman greets her with a shotgun.  The rudeness and hostility seemed so unnecessary.  This film kept adding characters probably to make the plot more complex.  However, it does nothing but extend the monotony of this dull work.  The film does include a strip humiliation scene that is humorous, tighty-whitey comment and all.

The cast is diverse in terms of race and gender.  They even have Bently from ""The Jeffersons"" in it.  Cutie Sonny Landham appears here.  However, his character meets the same fate that all of his movie characters do.",1152057600,2,1077,4.846153846153846
