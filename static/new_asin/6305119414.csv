8470790,4,6305119414,"Kyle Webb is exemplary in demonstrating various East & West Coast Intermediate Swing steps and combinations in an easy-to-learn.  The patterns are of the 60s variety, however, these steps are seen often in clubs around the country.  Although not extremely flashy, such as steps used by Frankie Manning or Marcus Koch, the average person can learn these movements and look presentable on any dance floor.  Style is obviously missing, however, each person should develop his or her own anyway.
The combinations are danced, broken down into steps, then danced again to music.  Leading is particularly emphasized by presenting the steps from different vantage points with associated hand placements.  I have found this type of instruction lacking in some of the more expensive dance tapes.
The video is of good quality with ample lighting and sound.  Considering the cost of the video, it's a bargain.",1010966400,,897,5.194444444444445
8470791,2,6305119414,"If you've just gotten into swing dancing b/c the moves you see people doing are so cool don't get this tape. I bought the series and it almost made me stop dancing, b/c it's so boring, and instructors are complete dorks! You learn some basic moves, but dancing is not about moves but style! A monkey can learn the step and do it on the floor but it's going to look funny. I would recommend checking out Paul Overton and Sharon Ashe, I bought their East Coast tape series close to a year ago and I've still to learn all the moves on them and I dance every weekend! For lindy hop, you just need to take classes, I have tapes for Lindy Hop but when you first start out, you absolutely need an instructor to teach the mechanics of the dance, ie styling!",970617600,2,749,4.208333333333333
8470792,4,6305119414,"This tape was easy to learn from.  The explanations of each move are clearly demonstrated.  First, there is a dance segment that shows the viewer an example of the blended moves.  Then each move is broken down and  explained.  Finally, the move is put together again.  The instructors are  somewhat wooden and humorless in their verbal explantions, but they get the  job done in their demonstrations.  My husband, a reluctant dancer at best,  enjoys these videos and dances with me.",941760000,23,482,4.9125
