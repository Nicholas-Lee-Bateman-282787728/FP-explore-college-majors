8441581,5,B004UITSCY,"Last night I did all my cross-training on various machines to the Bike-O-Vision Cycling Journey - South Carolina Backroads.

After 15 or maybe 30 minutes, I was ready to come in and write a review that said, ""Beautiful back roads, lots of green trees, but rather boring, not my favorite Bike-O-Vision trip.""

Right after thinking those thoughts, the trip changed. We went up King Mountain. We went to little resort towns. Then, my beautiful little town of Beaufort where I've only lived in my imagination, but love it anyway! Then more towns that are just a joy to bicycle through.

Don't give up and think that the long, L-O-N-G, roads at the beginning are all of it. They saved the best for last!  Next time I think I'll go straight to the Beaufort part. Loved it!",1309132800,,766,4.610294117647059
