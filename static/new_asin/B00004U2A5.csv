7923401,3,B00004U2A5,"HIT-MAN IN THE HAND OF BUDDHA (1980) is one of the highlights of Tai Seng's new line of Martial Arts Theater releases. It was produced, directed by, and stars Hwang Jang Lee (spelled Wang Chin Li in the credits), the Korean kickboxing champ who made his name in Hong Kong and Taiwanese kung fu films in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is the first film I've seen in which he plays the hero. He's clearly at his peak here and is seen executing his famous ""triple kick"" maneuver, in which he leaps up and delivers three consecutive kicks to his opponent, all without wires or trampolines. He does stick fighting in addition to his trademark kicking. The fights are all well staged and nicely photographed on locations (probably in Taiwan) that are a welcome change from the standard Hong Kong sites.
The portly comic actor Fan Mei-Sheng plays a sly Fagin-type character (out of Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"") who directs a band of kids to steal food and pick pockets for him. He becomes Hwang's friend and is instrumental in getting him to a monastery for the extra training he'll need to defeat the bad guy. Eddy Ko plays Tiger, a greedy rice merchant seeking to control the market, who causes the death of Hwang's sister and her husband. Ko has the final fight with Hwang. I've seen Hwang Jang Lee as a bad guy in many films, but few which showcase his skills as well as this one. The one that comes closest is HELL'S WINDSTAFF, another unsung kung fu showcase.",983923200,,1460,4.555133079847908
