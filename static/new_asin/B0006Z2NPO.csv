A few moments when everybody involved hit their emotional marks with finesse.",1509926400,,252,4.270833333333333

8044167,2,B0006Z2NPO,"This movie started out well enough, with a mother and her moody teen daughter escaping for the summer to a rented house, where the daughter soon meets a young man that only she can see.  She also goes to her shrink because she had made a suicide attempt.  Then she appears to be a sort of magnet for the spirits of the dead, including a woman she used to know, some old guy, some older woman.......
By that point it gets so hard to follow that there really isn't much point in going on.  Too bad, because the actors were good enough, and the photography and visual effects were quite good for a low budget feature.",1274140800,2,614,4.275862068965517
8044168,2,B0006Z2NPO,"This is a ghost story, a supernatural drama. It is not a thriller. It is not science fiction.

Langley (X-Files), Diana Troy (Star Trek Next Generation) and Commodore Ross (Space Above and Beyond) are the ""stars"" used to get you to watch the film. David Hedison is from Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. That is on DVD but don't rent it. Watch a clip on Youtube and then just leave it be.

These actors will appeal to Science fiction fans which is why it is listed as a science fiction movie.

The dialog and acting are pretty weak. The whole movie is After School Special dull. I found the story telling and pace to be fair. The way they handle the ghosts was novel enough. This is a 2 of 5 star movie that I did not mind watching.",1273622400,,731,4.170212765957447
8044169,3,B0006Z2NPO,"I was a bit disapointed in this movie, however I bought this because of Marina Sirtis and Linda Park. I'm a fan of both of these women, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi from Star Trek the next generation, and Linda Parks from Star Trek Enterprise. The Star Trek ladies are the reason for this purchase. This movie is still OK. If you are a star trek fan then you should buy this movie.",1210291200,,381,4.232876712328767
8044170,2,B0006Z2NPO,"Did you ever watch a movie where it's so evident that everyone involved is trying their darndest to make it a winner, but it's a lost cause? That would sum up ""Spectres"", a low-budget film that plays out like a Lifetime Television take on a supernatural thriller. The plot revolves around a mother (Star Trek the Next Generation's Marina Sirtis) and her daughter, and the strange events that plague them after a retreat to a summer home for an extended vacation.

What unfolds seems to revolve around the young daughter's suicide attempt and some convoluted mess wherein a single soul shared by a variety of dead souls enters her body while at the same time causing paranormal activity in the house? I end that with a question mark because I just didn't get it, and I'm not stupid. It's just poorly written.

The problems with this movie all walk hand-in-hand to form a disaster. The script is a complete nightmare, with every mother-daughter cliche only exacerbated by Sirtis' desperate attempt to make their interactions seem genuine. They don't, and it's not for want of talent on her part.

The movie can't decide what it wants to be, and it does a poor job of blending genres. You know how sometimes you're with your friends and you say ""I have this great idea!"" This is what would happen if someone made the poor choice of turning it into an actual film. It reads like the writer said ""Wouldn't it be cool if...""

Watching the bonus making of featurette on the DVD is almost painful because everyone is SO into what they're doing - the director uses the word ""Compelling"" about a thousand times - it's so sad how horrible it turned out.

In short, it just misses the mark on every level. It isn't scary, or even slightly creepy. It isn't emotionally moving. It just isn't anything at all.",1143072000,7,1794,4.628930817610063
8044171,2,B0006Z2NPO,"I had really looked forward to this movie, but for the first half hour or so I was lost, whafted back and forth in confusion, until it started to reveal the story for what it was. It tried, oh it tried, it could've been a winner, but it wasn't.

I think they should have given 'William' the ghost more of a part than a piano playing ghost who had about 10 lines in the movie near the end. And the premise of William could have been a story in itself...but no, he simply tried to explain all the ghosts haunting the place as being one soul...really dumb.

Don't get me wrong, I like all the talent in this movie. Well acted, by all, but the story, oh the story, if only, if only, if only....",1114560000,3,690,4.103703703703704
