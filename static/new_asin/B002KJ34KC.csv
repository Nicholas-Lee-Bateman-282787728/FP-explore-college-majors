8372015,4,B002KJ34KC,"The plot itself is nothing very complicated. Henry IV is confronted to a rebellion from the Scots, from the House of York and Yorks archbishop, and finally from Wales. We are fully engaged in the War of Roses and Henry IV has to postpone his crusade to Jerusalem to stop the rebellion that had reached the point when they were dividing the country into three shares as if they were sure to win.

He decides to go to war but he has to chastise his son, the Prince of Wales, first before going because the Prince is having a very sorry life, low life actually with some thieves and dissolute people among whom Falstaff, Sir or no Sir, is a flamboyant and out of proportion character.

And off they go to war. The main leader of the Scots, Hotspur, is killed by the Prince of Wales after the prince had saved his father from the rebel, and the other rebels are taken into captivity, but not for long since they are all sentenced to death except Archibald, Earl of Douglas. Then half of the army goes to York to pacify them and the second half under the Kings and the Prince of Wales command go to Wales to clean up the place.

But the play is remarkable because of elements that have little to do with the plot or story, or even history. It is the invention of Sir Falstaff, a character that has become an opera of his own due to his Shakespearean fame. He is a marginal character, fat and constantly under the influence of sack, some alcohol common in those days, and permanently eating. When he is not eating or drinking he is sleeping and snoring. He is the main companion of the Prince of Wales who spends a lot of time in a tavern with a band of shady people, half thieves, half anything illegal that pays. These scenes in this history are comical scenes, pure farce indeed with tremendous wit in the language, popular wit that is not for childrens ears, though in Shakespeares time that was not a problem at all, children learning about bees, birds and moss quite early in life and with their own eyes, at times hands.

Thats the first element of interest, in fact a genial invention or innovation: mixing farce into a history that is supposed to be dramatic, and whats more that farce is the darker side of the Prince of Wales. That first element has an equivalent among the princes, on the rebellions side: their wives are entertainers and the Welsh wife of one sings them, and us, a Welsh song to put their husbands to sleep, though in fact it does not achieve such an aim since they are suddenly called by military duty.

The second innovation is to send these people to the war, Sir Falstaff at their head. He is not a valiant soldier but he knows how to die with courage and enough simulation for everyone to believe it is true. He also reveals another side of these wars: the survivors picked the pockets of the dead, nobles or not.

That is well shown but television is not the best medium for battles. It is perfect for tavern scenes that are locked up in small spaces but not for a battlefield. It was already true in Shakespeares time who only had a very limited stage. No army could be seen on the stage and no army is really shown on the screen. This TV adaptation centers on individuals, on fights between two people at the most and whats more centered on close-up images that erase the fight really and we only have two bodies more or less entangled into some struggle to the death.

The problem that is clearly experienced by the King is the fact that he did not receive power in a pure feudal way. In fact he seized it. He forced Richard II to abdicate and give him his crown, hence going against the sacred nature of kingship, and then he suggested he be killed and he was, even if later on Henry IV condemned the killer and thus denied his desire and yet a Kings desire is a command, as is well known. A king with pangs of conscience is rare, isn't it, but yet the play is kind of hollow as Richard II as often been qualified. And the production is just wrapping up that hollowness.

8372016,5,B002KJ34KC,"When William Shakespeare's history play, ""The History of Henrie IV"" (later renamed ""The History of Henry IV"" Part 1 to distinguish it from its sequel) entered onto the literary stage towards the end of the 16th century, both figuratively and metaphorically, one of the most famous and popular of Shakespeare's characters made his debut: Sir John ""Jack"" Falstaff. As far as we know, Falstaff was an immediate sensation, attested by the numerous quarto editions printed prior to the so-called Shakespeare First Folio of his collected works which appeared in 1623. Sir John Falstaff, possibly loosely based on Sir John Oldcastle, a knight and friend of Henry V until he rebelled against the king, is an old knight whose ""vassals"" are a bunch of drunken lowlifes who congregate with him at his ""court"", a tavern far removed from real court life among the nobility. Although, one frequenter of the tavern and friend of Falstaff is Prince Hal, son of King Henry IV.

Three different groups of characters form the play ""Henry IV Part 1"". There is the king and his immediate group of advisers, a rogue group who have designs to overthrow the king, and Falstaff and his group of ""courtiers"" at his tavern. Prince Hal moves within the circles of two of the three groups, until, by play's end, all three groups converge in the climactic scene. While the play is named ""King Henry IV Part 1"", much of the stage-time is devoted to the relationship between Prince Hal and Sir John Falstaff. We never know why Prince Hal congregates with these drunkards, but we learn at play's beginning, he's been doing this for a long time.

The play begins circa 1400. It's been approximately one year since Henry of Bolinbroke, now King Henry IV (Jon Finch), deposed his inept and unresolved cousin, King Richard II in one of the most famous coups in English history. However, even after a year, there is still uncertainty in the court regarding King Henry, mainly among the nobles and barons that he has no legitimate claim to the throne. And there had been an outbreak near the Scottish and Wales border at the play's beginning, involving King Richard's chosen heir, Mortimer.

Edmund Mortimer, brother of Henry Percy Hotspur, is being held ransom by a Welsh traitor, Owen Glendower. Hotspur insists Mortimer fought valiantly against the rebels, but the king, based on his own intelligence, doesn't believe Mortimer to be as loyal and brave as Hotspur propagates and refuses to pay the ransom for Mortimer's release. The Percy's also hold in their charge prisoners from the rebellion, and the king wants them turned over to him, but they refuse to comply because of Edmund Mortimer. This compels Hotspur and other members of the Percy family, notably his uncle Thomas Percy, to raise an army and rebel against the king. The Percy's had backed Henry during the coup allowing him to become king.

On another front is Prince Hal (David Gwillim) who has been commiserating with Sir John Falstaff (Anthony Quayle) and his congregation of drunkards at a tavern, presumably in the seedier side of London. Most of the cronies are far older than Prince Hal, save one, Poins, who appears not only to be the same age as Hal but probably more intelligent than the others. Poins convinces Hal to play a trick on Falstaff and his drunkards. Through conniving, they convince Falstaff that he and some of the other bar-flies should rob money from some wealthy traveling tradesmen/travelers. Unbeknownst to them, Hal and Poins in turn plan to rob the money from Falstaff and friends, knowing that when they return to the tavern, Falstaff will boast that they were set upon by 20 to 30 vagabonds. Their predictions prove right, but Falstaff exceeds expectations, claiming he was set upon by 100 vagabonds who he fought off valiantly!

Eventually, a messenger is sent to the tavern summoning Hal back to the court at the king's behest. In a brilliant scene, Falstaff and Hal re-enact Hal's return to the king, with Falstaff playing the king and Hal himself, then reversing the roles. However, when Hal does confront his father back at the castle, neither of the play-acting scenes mirrors the confrontation. The king, in perhaps the most famous scolding in Shakespeare, reprimands his son for commiserating with the barflies at the tavern, reminding him he is to be king one day, and his behaviors shame him and his noble-royal family. He reminds Hal that they have serious matters to attend to, notably to confront Hotspur and the rebellion. Even though Hotspur's behavior has turned treasonous, the king admires Hotspur's military resolve, not convinced Prince Hal has the same metal.

This is a wonderful production of perhaps William Shakespeare's best fusion of drama and comedy in a play. Jon Finch makes a compelling King Henry IV, his resonant voice echoes the words of Shakespeare of the late 16th century portraying a medieval king of the early 15th century. David Gwillim makes a good Prince Hal, who must juggle his desire to hang out with Falstaff and friends and yet do his duty as prince to the king. However, Anthony Quayle nearly steals the show as Sir John Falstaff. Quayle makes the lines of Falstaff his own, the old knight constantly telling stories of passed exploits in which the details are just a little bit bloated. In an interesting turn, when Prince Hal rhetorically puts Falstaff in a corner after the old knight claimed he was set upon by 100 vagabonds, and Hal admits it was only he and Poins, Falstaff in true Shakespeare fashion comes up with a quick-witted response!",1471392000,,5556,4.880296610169491
8372017,4,B002KJ34KC,"I tend not to like taped versions of live performances (they remind me of the Seventies, when all the sit-coms were ""taped before a live audience,"" like ""All In the Family""), but this 2015 attempt is much better than the 2012 Globe Theatre's taped live performance, which is just awful. Now I own them both, but I play only one for my college Shakespeare students--and this is the version I show. Hotspur is sub-par, even bizarre, and Hal is not quite how I'd play him, but fun nonetheless. King Henry is fantastic. And as for Falstaff--quite remarkable: A Falstaff who is melancholy and downcast yet still able simultaneously to come across as the greatest comic character in western literature. A lovely performance.",1465171200,,718,4.89344262295082
