1846978,3,B00008HCA1,"2003 so far as not been a excellent year for the wwe, but the ppv was not that bad!  Again, this is the first time in half a year since we've seen the Austin, the Rock, and Hogan in the ring.  ...  Here's the list of what you will see and my opinion of the matches.
1.  Jeff Hardy vs Y2J
  Even thought this was supposed to be Test's match instead of Hardy's, this was still a good match.  As you would expect, it was high-flying and very fast-paced match but Hardy losing streak continued as he tapped out to the walls of jericho.  HBK comes in to make the save.  I have to admit I had to stop and hear the crowd's reaction where he came out to see how they would treat him after the last ppv held there.  Good match
2.  RVD and Kane vs William Regal and Lance Storm
  A match made up at the last minute and was not as bad as what other people make it out to be.  RVD and Kane work really well as a team.  The ending was a little disappointing as Storm messed up Kane's mask, causing him not to see and accidentally chokeslamming RVD and allowing storm and regal to pick up the victory.
3.  Undertaker vs Big Show
  I wasn't quite for sure if this was going to be a good match since Big Show's matches aren't usually that good.  However, this was an exception.  It was the first time that I can remember where the undertaker had to rely on submissions and techincial wrestling to win a match.  Because the big show was too big for the chokeslam, last ride or tombstone.  Believe it or not, big show did put on a good wrestling match.  People may not like the big show or a-train but since they've been working with Paul Heyman, they have shown some major signs of improvement.  Taker used a triangle choke to seal the deal.  After the match Taker tries to get retribution for what Show did to him last October, but A-train came in and delivered the derailer (formerly known as the baldo bomb) and talked trash to Taker afterwards.  Good match.
4.  6 man tag  Edge, Lesnar, and Benoit vs Team Angle
  This was a very disappointing match-up.  First, Edge was attacked and could not compete and the match itself was not as good as you would expect from these fine performers.  It just looked like it was planned out very well.  Benoit made Shelton Benjamin tap out to the crossface.  Brock F-5ed Angle as he was trying to break the hold.
5.  Mattitude Version 1 vs Billy Kidman
  Matt had to lose some weight to compete in this match and after losing to kidman week after week on smackdown, he was out to seek revenge and this was his solution.  Shannon Moore, Matt's little follower didn't really play that much of a role expect he was the beat up guy as he usually his.  Matt nailed a regular twist of fate but couldn't pick up the win but later nailed it from the top rope and became the new cruiserweight champion.
6.  HHH vs Big Poppa Pump
  A rematch from a disappointing effort from the Royal Rumble, once again did not show much improvement.  Steiner bottom line is not ready to be main eventing and to improve his wrestling ability.  The crowd even acknowledged that.  The evoultion also known as eviloution(Flair, Orton, and Batista) helped interfere in the match which allowed HHH to hit the pedigree and remain champion.
7.  Austin vs Bischoff
  This is one of the matches that you just had to sit back and get a good laugh out of.  The PPV's title was appriorate for this match was it was No Way Out for Bischoff.  Austin just beat the hell out of Bischoff giving him not one, not two, not even three but FOUR Stone Cold Stunners as his employees from the raw side watched on in laughter.  Again, it is nice to see Austin back, God knows the wwe needs him.
8.  Hogan vs Rock
  Not an improvement from WM 18, but a good effort considering that neither one has stepped foot in a wwe ring since August.
It was obvious who the fan favorite was this time around and Hogan despite his age still put on a good performance which ended up in another Monteral screw-job, but a more creative one as that.  The referee come to find out is wrestling trainee who was in cahoots with the rock and Vinne Mac.  As Hogan dropped the big legdrop and went for the pin the lights went out and when they came back on here comes vince, the referee brought steel chair to the ring and helped screw hogan out of the victory.  This was basically a way to lead up to the big hogan vs mcmahon fight at wrestlemania.
This No Way Out is not the best one in the whole series that started in 1998, but it was still a good show.",1047427200,2,4506,4.241460541813899
1846979,4,B00008HCA1,"Here's my review of the WWE's most recent Pay-Per-View, No Way Out. And now, the matches and my rating out of 5 *****
Chris Jericho v.s. Jeff Hardy
A pretty predictable match, but it turned out to be a really good opener to quite a show. Jeff and Jericho have many great spots during the match, and HBK even makes an appearance. ***1/2
World Tag Team Title: William Regal, Lance Storm v.s. Kane, RVD
A very predictable match as it was a match sorta put together at the last minute on RAW. Match was okay, but the ending really stunk. **3/4
Cruiserweight Title: Matt Hardy v.s. Billy Kidman
Yet another predictable, not-so-great match. Sorry, but Matt Hardy just isn't quite a cruiserweight so this match was pretty basic and didn't even resemble a cruiserweight match. Oh well I guess. **
Undertaker v.s. Big Show
This match is almost all Big Show so it moves really slow. This match also made Undertaker look like a real weakling (which he's not!) when he was trying to pick up Show so many times and he couldn't. A cool spot was when 'Taker did his unbelievable no-hands swan dive over the top rope onto A-Train (ugh) on the outside. Match was about *3/4 because of Show's slow offense.
Brock Lesnar, Chris Benoit v.s. Kurt Angle, Team Angle
Edge was supposed to be in this match but was taken out prior to it (because he needs neck surgery) so this ended up being a handicap match. In my opinion, WWE really needs to can this whole Team Angle thing with Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin. Too many reasons to follow that statement. Anyway, the match wasn't too bad, some pretty nice moves though when Angle and Lesnar get in there it becomes so dull as Angle applys a rear-chin lock (which the announcers seem to think is a choke hold ((jeez))the whole time on Brock for at least FIVE MINUTES! AAAHHHH! Anyway- **3/4
World Title: HHH v.s. Scott Steiner
Not too much of a match. Scott is a little slow and HHH was still kinda injured. Here's another angle that needs to be canned: The Evolution. Pretty much a recycled D-Generation X but not nearly as cool. Match was about **1/2
Steve Austin v.s. Eric Bischoff
STONE COLD RETURNS!! Oh, sorry, it was an exciting moment! Even though the match is only about six minutes long, it's a great match just because of Stone Cold. It's so great to see him back finally! ***3/4 for the excitment of seeing Austin back alone!
Rock v.s. Hogan II
Not exactly an improvement from last year's WrestleMania match-up between the two but it's still pretty good. The ending was pretty unique as Vince McMahon gives us: The Montreal Screwjob II. I guess one screwjob in Montreal wasn't enough for 'ol Vinnie Mac. Match was about *** Hopefully Rock will stay longer this time around, but that looks pretty doubtful.
This years No Way Out PPV wasn't bad but some matches needed a little more work. Although it's also rather historic as it has STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN'S RETURN MATCH! JOY!",1046304000,,2917,4.590038314176245

1846981,5,B00008HCA1,"no way out 2003 was alot better then the royal rumble 2003. here are the matches:
Match 1:Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy-9.5/10-it was suppose to be test instead of hardy but him and stacy didn't show up to a raw before this show so the wwe took them off of the  card. anyway, the match was great. jericho was awesome. jeff hardy did his best, which resulted in a really good matchup.jericho won when he makes jeff tap to the walls of jericho. shawn micheals and christian make a quick appearence after the match.
Match2:raw tag titles-kane/rvd vs. regal/storm-7.5/10- i thought that it could have been better. but for what it was it was good. regal and storm won when storm pulled kanes mask over his eyes and then he chokeslammed rvd on accident. regal/ storm then pinned rvd.
Match3:Cruiserweight title-matt hardy vs. billy kidman-10/10- after matt finally lost his ten pounds he was able to beat kidman in this fantastic cruiserweight battle. matt won on a top rope twist of fate!
Match 4:the undertaker vs the big show-10/10- this was suprisingly awesome! it had a scientific ending where taker made the show pass out in the triangle choke! the taker kicked out of the show's huge chokeslam.the taker even did his famous plancha over the top rope onto paul heyman and a-train. i thought this would be a 5/10 match, but it wasn't. it was GREAT!
Match 5:3 on 2 handicap match:team angle vs. lesnar and benoit-8.5/10 too bad edge wasn't in it. it could have been longer and better, but it was still good. benoit and lesnar won when benoit made charlie hass tap out to the crippler crossface
Match6: world title: triple h vs. scott steiner-5/10-just horrible. it was even worse then their match at the rumble. atleast the canadien crowd gives them what they deserve- alot of boring chants and alot of boo's-hhh won with the pedigree.
Match7:stone cold vs. eric bischoof-10/10. i gave it a 10 because of the moment not the match. stone cold won after a bunch of stunners. atleast he is back!!!
Match 8:Hulk Hogan vs. the rock- 9/10- the match was okay and the ending was awesome. hogan hit the legdrop and then the lights went out and when they came back on the ref was knocked out and vince was there. hogan and vince started to talk trash, and then the ref woke up and gave the rock the chair. the rock hit him with it and finished it off with a rock bottom!
overall no way out 2003 is a highly recommeneded pay per view. buy it as soon as it comes out!",1046131200,,2453,4.524774774774775

NO WAY OUT 2008.

RAW ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH *Winner gets a WWE Title match at WM24*
Triple H def. Jeff Hardy, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, JBL, and Umaga.
- In what was a great main event, this match entertained. Very brutal. Last chamber with blood. If you don't count the hard way. Lots of cool spots in this one. Triple H pins Jeff Hardy after a Pedigree onto a steel chair, which would be the second Pedigree.

SMACKDOWN! ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH *Winner gets a World Title match at WM24*
The Undertaker def. Batista, MVP, Finlay, Khali, and Big Daddy V.
- Pretty good match here. Once Khali and Big V are out the way. By the way, Batista had a huge spinebuster on Big Daddy V. Awesome spot. And then MVP being on the wrong end of a huge chokeslam! Undertaker gets the win after a tombstone on Batista.

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
Edge(c) vs. Rey Mysterio
- Rey was injured, so was limited in this match. But it still was good. Edge wins after a nice looking spear. After the match, Big Show returned and targerted Rey. But, Floyd Maywether made the save and broke Big Show's nose.

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
Randy Orton(c) vs. John Cena
- Cena returned at the Rumble match and won, but he couldn't wait till Wrestlemania for a title shot. Orton took Cena out and his now the WWE Champion. Lots and lots of history between these two guys. Nice match here, Orton was on a roll and Cena looked good since returning. Cena has had him at every cornerr in this match, so Orton got himself DQ'ed. Cena hit the FU after the match and locked in a sick STFU on Orton.

ECW CHAMPIONSHIP
Chavo Guerrero(c) vs. CM Punk
- This match was a nice opener, and didn't really disappoint. Chavo has had Punk's number. And tonight was not different. Chavo defeated CM Punk, yet again.

CAREER THREATENING MATCH
Ric Flair vs. Mr. Kennedy
- Flair was on a roll since the ruling that if he would lose a match, he'd be forced to retire. And tonight, he continued that streak. By making Kennedy tapout.

No Way Out 2008 was a good event and 2008 was a good PPV year. 7.5/10 stars.",1389571200,,2124,4.456185567010309

1846992,5,B00008HCA1,"This right here was a overall, pretty nice ppv, i was happy with the turn out.

ECW championship
Chavo Guerrero vs. CM Punk
This was actually good for its short time, but at least these two put on a descent opener to a great ppv. I wasn't to surprised that Chavo won after cheating to steal another match, but i was surprised he won the title. 3/5

Elimination Chamber match for a shot at the World Heavyweight championship at Wrestlemania 24
Undertaker vs. Batista vs. Finlay vs. MVP vs. The Great Khali vs. Big Daddy V
WOW! This was actually a better turn out to a chamber than i thought it would be. This match was just a show, thsi had brutality, chokeslams, ddts, and everything else you can think of in a chamber match. But each one of these men were on the run to a title shot a wrestlemania 24. This match had some nice moments like a ddt on the steel to big daddy v, the triangle choke hold and making khali bleed from his mouth, a chokeslam off the pod to MVP, a chokeslam on the steel to finlay, and the winning tombstone to Batista to give taker his first win in the elimination chamber, and getting a shot to the world title. 5/5

Career Threatening match
Ric Flair vs. Mr. Kennedy
This was actually a good match. I liked that Flair won to stay in the wwe, but i was upset to see flair go at wrestlemania only from the help of shawn michaels. This may have been short and boring at times, but was good. 3/5

World Heavyweight championship
Edge vs. Rey Mysterio
Why. These two are some of the best superstars in the buisness here, and they make this a freakin crappy five minuet match. The match was slow only because of information of FM_ALEX, Mysterio had a injury and slowed down the match. This rivalry carried to No Way Out is because Mysterio kept beating the crap out of Vickie by accident. But, i thought these two would have a descent match like they did at the rumble, but this match sucked eggs. 2/5

WWE championship
Randy Orton vs. John Cena
This match was only twelve minuets long, but this match was pretty descent. These two always put on some good matches with each other and this was almost one of them. They really had a good build up to this match and only let Cena win by DQ, is because he won the rumble, so it carried on to wrestlemania. But other than the ending, this was actually a nice match. 3.75/5

Elimination Chamber match for a shot at the WWE championship at Wrestlemania 24
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. JBL vs. Umaga vs. Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy
This was maybe one of the best chambers i have ever seen. Each of the three ppvs with chambers ever since 2008 had great chambers, but this match took some of the cake, this was just a bloody, hardcore match. There were some huge moments like jericho getting a codebreaker out of nowhere, JBL going chair crazy, four finishers on umaga including a swanton from the top of the pod, and a pedigree on a chair to get a title shot for the game at wrestlemania. 5/5

Well, this ppv had two five star chamber matches and was very enjoyable. Well, goodbye No Way Out, hello ELIMINATION CHAMBER! I recommend picking this one up.",1279152000,,3119,4.339622641509434
1846993,1,B00008HCA1,"This PPV is crazy. I mean nothing about this show makes sense. Like Wrestlemania 9,WWE Survivor series 1993 & WCW Greed it's the kind of PPV that they would show to Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange to break his mind. The ultimate lowpoint was the barbed wire steel cage match for the WWE championship between JBL & Big Show which was just as bad as the movie:Barb Wire. Get it? The only good matches were the Cruiserweight open and the Kurt Angle-John Cena bout which both stole the show but that's still not enough to save this pile of trash. The rest were second to third rate. I give this ""PPV"" a 2 out of 10.",1277942400,,616,4.318965517241379

The worst matches and thats saying alot were the HHH-Scott Steiner rematch which was shorter but still just as bad as their Royal Rumble encounter,the Steve Austin-Eric Bischoff match was horrible no matter how much Jim Ross(who returned at this PPV) & the rest of the fans in the arena liked it and the Rock-Hogan rematch which failed to live up to their Wrestlemania 18 bout with VKM's interference making it worse. The rest were duds. I give this event a 1 out of 10.",1277856000,,577,4.5576923076923075
1846995,3,B00008HCA1,"ECW Championship Match: Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. CM Punk
The build-up to this match was interesting, and the match itself was interesting, too. Both superstars put on a great performance with lots of kicks, suplexes, and fast-paced action. Chavo really proved he is a great wrestler to this day, and the crowd turned on CM Punk half way through the match for using one of Eddie Guerrero's taunts and then attempting to do the Three Amigos on Chavo. This led to Chavo getting momentum in the match, and the finish came in a cool fashion when Chavo countered a super hurracarana attempt by Punk by hanging onto the ropes. Chavo then took advantage of the situation and nailed the Five-Star Frog Splash for the victory. Winner: Chavo Guerrero. Match Rating: 4/5

#1 Contender's Elimination Chamber World Heavyweight Championship Match: Batista vs. Big Daddy V (with Matt Striker) vs. Finlay vs. MVP vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh) vs. The Undertaker
A phenomenal Elimination Chamber, which is something I didn't expect considering The Great Khali was a part of it, as well as Big Daddy V, plus we have seen Batista and Undertaker so many times that it's not even funny. Still, I was blown away with the proceedings as the entire match was solid and the crowd was into it the entire time. The first two men in the ring were, expectedly, Undertaker and Batista. They put on a great showing and performed some solid wrestling, taking each other out by hitting each other simultaneously with a big boot and then Big Daddy V got involved. I expected the match to slow down at this point, but it played out well. Big Daddy V nailed some sick slaps to the chest and dominated for a bit, even knocking Undertaker into the Elimination Chamber door, which sent him falling down the steel steps and onto the concrete outside. Big Daddy V nailed some powerful moves on Batista and was actually doing quite well for himself until Batista nailed a Spinebuster, followed by Undertaker hitting a DDT on Big Daddy V on the steel. This eliminated him and then Khali entered the match to ""You can't wrestle"" chants. Khali proved them right by hitting basic chops but also nailing some power moves. Batista got thrown onto the steel by Khali, and then Undertaker knocked Khali down. Khali's manager started to distract the referee, so Undertaker big booted the steel, causing it to hit Khali's manager. Undertaker then locked Khali in a Hell's Gates submission hold, and Khali tapped out! WWE played this out well. It's entertaining to see Khali and Big Daddy V, as long as they are taken out of the proceedings quickly, which is what happened here. Finlay was next and he entered the Batista/Undertaker fold nicely, nailing some power moves. He even hit a Celtic Cross on the Undertaker. MVP dominated the match after he entered, even using his chain as a weapon, busting Undertaker and Batista open. MVP retreated to the top of a chamber at one point and nailed the pursuing Undertaker with his chain, but Undertaker grabbed him by the throat and nailed a SPECTACULAR reverse Chokeslam off the top of the chamber. Finlay made the cover and eliminated MVP, but Finlay was then eliminated when Undertaker nailed a Chokeslam on Finlay onto the steel. Undertaker and Batista then pulled off some pretty sweet moves, with Undertaker kicking out of a Batista Bomb and Batista kicking out of the Last Ride. They did a number where Batista was ramming Undertaker head-first into the steel, and then Undertaker grabbed the steel, pushed backward, and both men flipped over the ropes, putting Batista in the position for the Tombstone Piledriver! Undertaker nailed the Tombstone and pinned Batista for the win! Winner: The Undertaker. Match Rating: 5/5

Career Threatening Match: Mr. Kennedy vs. Ric Flair
This match was quite ""blah"" throughout most of it. The beginning was a clone of the Flair/MVP match at the Rumble, and then the rest of the match Kennedy worked over Flair's leg and then locked on a Figure Four Leg Lock using the ring post for some excitement. The Figure Four was used multiple times by Kennedy, but when Flair finally got it locked on, Kennedy submitted. It was an okay match that moved at a steady pace and it was short enough that you wouldn't get insanely bored by it. I feel that one of Flair's last matches should have been given more effort though. Winner: Ric Flair. Match Rating: 3/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (Champion) vs. Rey Mysterio
Gah. This match was overshadowed by the previous month's title match between these two, which was simply phenomenal. Edge focused on Rey's injured bicep throughout the whole match, and Rey stole the show by hitting a moonsault and still managing to do his usual thing. The ending was almost exactly like last month's match. Rey hit the 619, but his injury wouldn't let him capitalize. He went back into the ring and went for a springboard cross body, but Edge hit a Spear in mid-air and pinned Mysterio. Disappointingly short and unoriginal match, all thanks to Rey's injury. Winner: Edge. Match Rating: 2/5

WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. John Cena
Wow, this match was just bad. Considering the buildup went all the way back to No Mercy 2007, I went away pretty disappointed. Orton and Cena just did their regular routine throughout the entirety of the match. It's amazing that the crowd got into it as much as they did. Almost nothing noteworthy happened until Orton feigned injury and nailed an RKO on the outside of the ring. Cena still managed to get back in the ring, and then Orton disqualified himself by slapping the referee across the face. Disappointing match that was too long and uneventful for its own good. There were a couple of good moments, like Orton countering the FU and when Orton didn't tap out to the STFU like everyone thought he would, but besides that, John Cena still has a long way to go. Winner: John Cena. Match Rating: 2/5

#1 Contender's Elimination Chamber WWE Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs. JBL vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Umaga
What an awesome way to end the night. The match started off fast-paced with Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels in the ring first. Considering the epic matches these two have had, this was a brilliant move by the WWE. They had their own little amazing match for a while, but then Umaga got into the mix and started wearing them down. JBL was in next, and the match was kind of all over the place, with JBL beating mostly on Chris Jericho and Umaga beating on Shawn Michaels. JBL got nailed with the Codebreaker out of nowhere and was eliminated, after Triple H had made his entry into the match. JBL brought some chairs into the ring to get revenge and nailed Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Jericho with the chair. He then acted like he was on Umaga's side, but then smashed the chair on Umaga's head. The second elimination came when Shawn Michaels nailed Umaga with the Sweet Chin Music, Jericho hit the Codebreaker, Triple H slammed him down with a Pedigree, and then Jeff Hardy finished him with a Swanton Bomb off one of the holding cells! As you can tell this match was very exciting throughout the entire thing. After Jericho and Michaels were eliminated, both of whom were busted open, Hardy and Triple H had their own personal match-up. Hardy went for a Swanton Bomb, but Triple H rolled out of the way. Triple H then nailed a Pedigree, but HARDY KICKED OUT!!! A frustrated Triple H brought one of JBL's chairs from earlier into the ring and went for the Pedigree on top of the chair. Hardy countered by hitting Triple H in the groin and he then went for the Twist of Fate! Unfortunately, Triple H countered by tossing Hardy on top of the chair. As Jeff got to his feet, Triple H hit him with a Pedigree to get the win! An exciting and adrenaline-pumping match! Winner: Triple H. Match Rating: 5/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS

Flair's speech after his match was entertaining; John Cena's beating of Randy Orton following their match was pretty slick as well. Big Show's speech and sudden heel turn where he attacked the already injured Rey Mysterio was lame since the fans were behind Show as a face before this incident. Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather coming to Mysterio's rescue and punching Show in the face was a plus, as was seeing Shane McMahon hold Show back just like the good 'ole days. An interaction between Shawn Michaels and Triple H was also a plus, if not a bit corny. The WrestleMania XXIV commercials were entertaining, but Maria's trip to the Playboy Mansion was unnecessary and lame. Rating: 4/5

EXTRAS

The only extra to speak of is an interaction between Michaels and Flair following the Elimination Chamber. This extra sets up WrestleMania XXIV nicely, though I wish there was more here. Rating: 3/5

OVERALL EVENT

The opening match was very solid, and both Elimination Chambers were EXCELLENT with great performances. The Flair/Kennedy match was ultimately disappointing, and both championship bouts were crap.

About a year ago this event took place and made history, it was the first event that would showcase two elimination chambers, one for each brand. Also I believe that this was the only event all year that featured no tag matches, could be wrong.

1.[ECW CHAMPIONSHIIP]-CHAVO GUERRERO VS CM PUNK-regardless of what other people say I enjoyed this feud, I thought these two were pretty entertaining sure the gulf thing was crazy but eh. I liked Chavo as the ECW champ because I think he would have fit in easily in the company, his uncle and Rey did. This was a pretty good opening contest to the event, both came to win and had a good match. It was pretty much a back and forth effort by both, but Chavo takes it after a frog splash. 3.5/5

2.[SMACKDOWN ELIMINATION CHAMBER]-BATISTA VS GREAT KHALI VS BIG DADDY V VS MVP VS FINLAY VS UNDERTAKER-the winner of this match would go on to get a title shot a Wrestlemania 24. The Undertaker and Batista kick things off nicely, kinda a rematch feel going between these two. Taker and Batista mainly turn this into a brawl early as the two big men try to take the other out early. Big Daddy V from ECW is the next to enter the chamber and goes right to work on both his opponents. He really starts to destroy both Batista and Taker even throwing Taker through the door and out onto the floor. But Taker would soon eliminate V but only seconds before Khali comes into the match and starts is destruction of these two, I hate when the fans start chanting at Khali. But Taker eliminates Khali after Taker applies a triangle choke I believe, it's cool that he does that. Finlay is next to enter the chamber but is quickly put down by Taker. But Finlay would soon start to mount some offense of his own, and gives things a little better pace to the match. He even slams Taker through one of the doors, but is then attacked by Batista. MVP is the last to enter but is met at the door by a flurry of angry Taker hands. MVP eventually mounts an offense and even brings in his own weapon but is soon tossed off the top only to get pinned by Finlay. Finlay though is taken out a little later after a vicious choke slam onto the steel. So  it was down to two, the two that started the match. The two would battle hard and would even survive each others finishers, surprised Batista kicked out of the Last Ride. Taker though wins the match after hitting a nice tombstone piledriver, and is off to Wrestlemania. 4/5

3.[CAREER THREATENING MATCH]-RIC FLAIR VS MR. KENNEDY-I have to say I was little disappointed with this match, not by much but I expected these two to really deliver a near classic. Sure Flair was older and was on his way out but I really felt like this was going to be something, Kennedy is one of my favorites and I thought he would tear it up with Flair. But while this match was a classic it was not bad either although it felt a little to slow and rushed all at the same time. Kennedy dominated pretty much the entire match really doing a number on Flair's legs, even doing the figure four on the post like Bret Hart once did. But Flair makes Kennedy tap to one of his own right in the middle of the ring. 3.5/5

4.[WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP]-EDGE VS REY MYSTERIO-this one had a pretty good storyline going into it, and looked like it could be really good. This match is pretty good and goes back and forth for most of the bout, kinda like the first match. This however is not the best match either one of these two have ever had, still it is good and entertaining. One problem with this match is that it seems way to short for a title match, like maybe it should have been on Smackdown and not a pay-per-view. Edge wins this one after he gives Rey a nasty spear, sorry Rey but you lost this one fair and square. 3.5/5

Big Show comes out after this match making a long awaited return to the ring, I for one was extremely happy that he came back. After addressing the crowd he goes right out after Rey and throws him in the ring. Of course Floyd Mayweather comes in and hits Show, but it don't matter I hate Mayweather and that guy would get smashed in MMA with out a doubt.

5.[WWE CHAMPIONSHIP]-RANDY ORTON VS JOHN CENA-these two had a great rivalry going on going into this match, Orton had injured Cena earlier and took his championship. This match is possibly the best non Chamber match of the night and not based purely on action, but also because these two tell a story in the ring instead of just doing moves. I found this match to be entertaining and since I like both these guys it is no surprise to me. This match is back and forth with plenty of close calls including a nice double count out that almost makes the ten count, and  an even closer one for Cena. But it does not matter since right after that Orton does the greatest thing I have ever seen to get disqualified. The ending alone makes this one a classic, maybe not technically but suspense and ending wise oh yeah. 5/5

6.[RAW ELIMINATION CHAMBER]-TRIPLE H VS JEFF HARDY VS SHAWN MICHAELS VS CHRIS JERICHO VS JBL VS UMAGA-HBK and Jericho starts things off and these two are no strangers to each other at all. These two go at it like it was just them in the match, and Jericho even blocks HBK's elbow off the top, never seen that before. Much like their Wrestlemania match they almost know every move the other is going to make which makes it interesting. Umaga is the first to be released and he comes in and just takes it to both guys, even giving a double Samoan drop. Umaga eventually ends up in a double submission with Jericho putting him in the walls of Jericho and HBK putting him in a cross face, but JBL comes in and saves him. JBL goes to work on everybody until Triple H is released and starts to destroy everybody. Not to long after Jericho eliminates JBL with a code breaker from no where after JBL hit Triple H, then JBL lays every one out with a chair. Once Jeff is finally let out things pick up quickly as he is all over the place until Umaga puts him down. Umaga is taken out though not to long after that as all of the others deliver their finishers, then right after Y2J feels some sweet chin music to be eliminated. Of course JBK gets eliminated by his best friend Triple H, so that leaves two. Triple H and Hardy go at it tooth and nail for a while just trying to kill the other, Hardy even kicks out of a pedigree. But it is another one onto a chair that does him in, but you can tell were the company was headed. Triple H won because he is a reliable draw for Wrestlemania but you could tell Jeff's time was coming. 5/5

This was pretty good event not the best ever and not the worst ever, the special features have a backstage confrontation that is a lead into HBK vs Flair at Mania.",1231891200,,6735,4.2745098039215685

#1 Jeff Hardy vs Chris Jericho
Very good opener for No Way Out. Chris Jericho took the win at 12 min and 59 sec. 9/10

Another good match and Hardy wins the title at 9:31. 7/10

This match is great. Just great. Stone Cold (of course) creams Bischoff at 4:26 after THREE Stone Cold Stunners. 10/10

Smackdown chamber - in my opinion this was the worst chamber ever. but it was still pretty good they like never had more than 3 people in the chamber at one time. some cool spots like when MVP got chokeslamed of a pod

edge vs. rey myestrio - okay match was short cause of rey's injury

1847011,4,B00008HCA1,The selling point to me was the two elimination chambers I knew the raw one would be good but the smackdown turned out better than I thought. Undertaker winning the smackdown one was kind of a let down to me but I think Him and Edge put on way better matches than Batista and Edge to me anyway. The Randy Orten vs John Cena Match was a classic to me just because Orten was up to his heal tricks The way the match ended got lots of heat. Then the Edge vs Ray was ok considered Ray was hurt but all in all I would recomend it I thought it was a pretty Good Show and a Great way to determine who would wrestle at mania for the Gold,1214179200,,628,3.875968992248062
1847012,4,B00008HCA1,"The DVD for this ppv has arrived. No Way Out is always an odd ppv. In January, the Royal Rumble begins the road to Wrestlemania. No Way Out is just the middle of the journey. Championships rarely change hands, and the show often feels more like hype for the March ppv.

This year, the show was fairly enjoyable. It had some good moments that are worth seeing. Again, there were matches that felt unexciting because we know what many of the Wrestlemania matches are likely to be.

THE SHOW
* ECW Championship: Chavo Guerrero (c) vs. CM Punk. This is just another bout between these two from the ECW roster. Having Punk as the only contender for Chavo's title continues to remind me how bare the ECW roster is. Are there no other people who could challenge for the belt? What about Shelton? Dreamer? Kofi? Morrison? I've enjoyed Punk ever since his days in Ring of Honor, but you can only have the same match so many times. As for the match itself, its a good opener. The crowd is hot and provides an extra sense of excitement. Notice the crowd turn on Punk when he tries to do Eddie's ""Three Amigos"".

* Mike Adamle interviews Rey Mysterio. A decent interview, with Mysterio admitting the injury he recently suffered. We get our first look at boxer, Floyd Mayweather, here.

* Smackdown Elimination Chamber: Undertaker vs. Batista vs. Finlay vs. Big Daddy V vs. MVP vs. Great Khali. This match was set to decide who would challenge the World Champion at Wrestlemania. The biggest problem with this match is that there are so many big men. Their size really slows down the match. Undertaker, Batista, & Finlay do what they can to energize the match, but they can only do so much on their own. MVP provides some good comedy when its his turn to come out. It really seems like only Undertaker or Batista belong in a match to determine the #1 Contender.

* Edge reacts to the Smackdown Elimination Chamber Match. Another segment that reminds people why Edge is the best heel in the business right now.

* Party at the Mansion. Weak segment, promoting Maria's playboy shoot.

* Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs. Mr. Kennedy. As the end of Flair's career comes closer, he faces off against one of the hottest young talents: Mr. Kennedy. They have a fairly decent match. Flair continues to elevate his game and Kennedy does his best to stand toe-to-toe with a legend. Nothing amazing here, but still an entertaining bout.

* Mr. McMahon visits Finlay in the Training Room.

* World Championship: Edge (c) vs. Rey Mysterio. This is one of those matches that loses something because you already know how it'll end. Mysterio is injured, slowing his performance down. Despite it, though, he still delivers better that most on the roster could. Edge plays his role perfectly and delivers a solid performance.

* Big Show's return. Following the match, Big Show makes his return for the first time since December 2006. He looks great! Show quickly turns heel and gets into a confrontation with Floyd Mayweather. Check out those punches!! A fun segment that ended with Show getting his nose broken. Welcome back. Ouch!

* WWE Championship: Randy Orton (c) vs. John Cena. The crowd doesn't seem to know what to do here. They boo Orton for being a heel, but they also want to boo Cena. They seem conflicted! These two give a great performance. Cena is always entertaining and there are some good spots. The ending to the match was perfect. I usually hate disqualifications, but this one did a great job of making Orton even more hated.

* Triple H talks with Shawn Michaels about the Elimination Chamber Match.

* Raw Elimination Chamber Match: Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Chris Jericho vs. Umaga vs. JBL. Like the EC match from earlier, this is set to determine who will challenge the WWE Champion at Wrestlemania. There are many more talented people in the Raw EC match than the Smackdown EC match, creating a much more entertaining main event. Umaga and JBL do what they can, while Jericho & Jeff provide a lot of fast paced action. Jeff continues to receive a much deserved push towards the main event. In the end, we have a new contender, and despite losing the match, Jeff still looks strong.

EXTRAS
* Shawn Michaels congratulates Ric Flair. A nice little backstage segment that teases a match between these two.

Overall, No Way Out doesn't have any title changes or big ramifications, but it is a strong prelude to Wrestlemania. The World title matches were enjoyable and the main event was a solid fight. Its definitely worth watching, but only hardcore fans should spend the money to buy the dvd.",1212019200,2,4615,4.6802469135802465
1847013,3,B00008HCA1,"I watched the Rock-Hogan Smackdown promo first, It was decent but both men have done hundreds better. Rock was on his way to Hollywood anyhow.

Rey Mysterio VS Jamie Noble: This was Sunday Heat match was a quick. It was alright but its Heat, meaning nothing speical.

Jeff Hardy VS Chris Jericho: This was a hell of an opener. This two worked well together and the last few minutes of this match were awesome. Loved the ending to the match. After, HBK comes out to save Hardy from a beating by Jericho and Christian. HBK gives Christian a superkick.

RVD and Kane VS Regal and Storm: Both teams were on there game during this match. RVD starts off with dazzling moves then Kane comes in and botched a elbow drop. The ending was perfect.

Billy Kidman VS Matt Hardy: A short but good contest. Im glad Shannon Moore didn't interfere and anther awesome ending. 3 in a row, unheard of for a PPV.

Brock Lesnar and Chris Benoit are backstage and its chaos because someone knocked Edge out of the match tonight. Boo hoo, I hate Edge anyways.

Big Show VS Undertaker: After three awesome matches, they had too have one bad match. This was it; A slow, decnt brawl between the two big men. The aftermath with Albert hitting the derailer was dumb and he should have done it on the chair instead.

Brock Lesnar and Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, and Charlie Haas: At this point in time, Smackdown had some of the greatest talent in the world. Paul Heyman was also in this match, too bad I hate hearing his voice. This match was good but the ending was fast paced confusion.

Scott Steiner VS Triple H: I liked there Royal Rumble match, even though alot of people hated it. Fans are booing and Lawler says its because there are alot of Triple H fans. Either that or this match sucked. I choose the latter. What a snorefest! I skipped this match, it sucked beyond belief.

Eric Bischoff VS Steve Austin: I skipped this. JR at the end of this match was funny; JR acted like Austin won the world title, let alone something much bigger. Calm down Ross, jeez.

Rock VS Hogan 2: I didn't think there WrestleMania match was all that great but I will admit, they are both two of the greatest showman of all time. This match sucked and the ending was stupid.

Overall, the first three matches were awesome. The last three matches were beyond bad. Id still buy the ppv but the last three matches ruined the event.",1211241600,,2406,4.457858769931663

Three world titles are on the line and Ric Flair puts his career on the line one again. This event is decent, but without the Chamber matches this wouldn't be anything worth picking up. The cover and DVD menu's are well done.  Also, I really like the theme song.

ECW Championship Match
Chavo Guerrero(c) VS CM Punk
Why is Chavo the ECW Champion? I have no idea. Either way, this is a solid match. Nothing amazing, but nothing horrible. You probably will only watch this match once.
RATING-7/10

Mike Adamle interviews Rey Mysterio and it is reveals that Mysterio has a torn bicep. Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather makes an appearance as well.

Smackdown Elimination Chamber
Undertaker VS Batista VS Finlay VS Big Daddy V VS MVP VS Great Khali
Four of the wrestlers in this match are big men wrestlers, so expect a slower paced match. The match starts with Batista and Undertaker and honestly doesn't get good until the 3rd man enters the match. There are some nice spots including BDV being hit with a DDT on the steel and MVP being thrown off the internal chamber.
RATING- 8.5/10

Career Threatening Match
Ric Flair VS Mr. Kennedy
Flair has been having many of these matches lately due to his new storyline. Vince McMahon says that if Flair loses any one-on-one match then he has to retire. This match is your average Raw match at best.

RATING-5/10

After the match, final Mysterio is being helped from ringside, Big Show's music hits. Big Show makes his return and tells us how he's lost 108 pounds and will be champion again. Then, he goes out of the ring and attacks Mysterio. He brings him back into the ring and sets him up for a chokeslam. Floyd Mayweather takes it upon himself to enter the ring and confront Big Show. What happens next will go down in history for years to come.

WWE Championship
John Cena VS Randy Orton(c)
Cena returned at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Royal-Rumble-2008/dp/B000ZIZXAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Royal Rumble 2008</a>&nbsp;and went on to win the Rumble match.

The crowd already hates Cena and that always makes for an interesting dynamic. You get a lot of punch-punch and kick-kick and your Cena/Orton moves, and that is all. The ending and a RKO on the floor make this only a little bit more interesting than the previous two matches.

Raw Elimination Chamber (Match of the DVD)

1847021,3,B00008HCA1,"No Way Out 2008 was a good event to begin the road to Wrestlemania 24 unlike the rumble. The 2 Elimination Chamber Matches were the highlights of the night and also the return of the Big Show.

1. Ecw World Championship
Chavo Guererro vs. Cm Punk
a good decent match to start off no way out. cm punk is a good competitor and chavo is a guererro so you can't go wrong with him. i'm glad the fans booed punk when he tryed to pull off the 3 amigos, punk shouldnt have tryed to pull that off but still a decent match to watch. 3.5/5

2. Smackdown Elimination Chamber Match
Undertaker vs. Batista vs. Great Khali vs. Big Daddy V vs. MVP vs. Finlay
a great elimination chamber match. i loved how undertaker and batista started it off and ended the match, that was good. it went kind of slow at first with the big guys entering the match but then it really got picked up when they got eliminated. great match. 4.5/5

3. Ric Flair vs. Mr. Kennedy
an alright decent match. kennedy is getting better and flair always makes his matches entertainable no matter how old he is. decent match. 3/5

4. World Heavyweight Championship
Edge vs. Rey Mysterio
not your typical edge and mysterio match due to rey's injury. it went slow and it was short, not a lot of high flying impact moves except for the end where edge speared rey out of mid-air for the win, other than that nothing exciting. 2.5/5

Big Show makes his big return back to show how much weight he lost and he also confronts Floyd Mayweather which leads to their match at wrestlemania.

5. WWE Championship
Randy Orton vs. John Cena
this wasn't their best confrontation they had but they did gave something to watch on the other hand. it had some good brawling between them too and some good outside action where orton rkoed cena on the floor. this match wasn't great but it's pretty watchable though.it was  a little unexpected in the way it eneded. 3.5/5

6. Raw Elimination Chamber Match
Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Umaga vs. Chris Jericho vs. JBL
this match was one step further than smackdowns ec match, this match was unbeleiveable. it started out with some good wrestling between jericho and hbk. once umaga and triple h got in there, it got pretty violent and they brought some furiousness into the match. some chairs got introduced and they used some/what. it came down to triple h and hardy. hardy would have been a good candidate to become # 1 contender but i guess it wasn't meant to be, but nevertheless amazing match all the way. 5/5

no way out 2008 was a pretty good ppv. i would buy to see the elimination chambers match if i was yall, they were really something. its worth the purchase on dvd.",1207440000,2,2675,4.442857142857143
1847022,4,B00008HCA1,"ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero vs. C.M. Punk - Good opening match as it was fast paced from start to finish with the only drawback being that it was less than 10 mins.  One interesting highlight was the fans who were behind Punk started booing the his attempt at the ""Three Amigos"" suplex.  Chavo retains the title & keeps his No Way Out winning streak at 4-0.

Elimination Chamber Match: Undertaker vs. Batista vs. Finlay vs. Big Daddy V vs. Great Khali vs. M.V.P. - Taker & Batista started it off & continued their ""on again/off again"" feud that been going on for the past year throughout the match with everyone else being bodies for Taker & Batista to go though throughout the match & keep them strong.  Big Daddy V & Khali were the first two from pods to come out & didn't even make it to the next period with the only thing memorable about their time in the match was Undertaker falling out of the chamber after a Daddy V headbutt that didn't look planned. Other moments to look out for were Hornswoggle creeping out from the bottom of the chamber to hand Finlay the weapon (sorry, cam't remember how to spell it), M.V.P.'s interaction with Undertaker from Taker waiting for his pod to open to his elimination via a chokeslam off the top of the pod, and the final moments with Taker finally getting the victory.

Ric Flair vs. Mr. Kennedy - Flair came into the match with an injured knee & Kennedy worked on that throughout the match including various versions of the figure four including the one around the turnbuckle pole that Bret Hart used to do.  Kennedy dominated the match with Flair getting the figure four on at the last minute to win.  As another review said, this was ""Cena/JBL WrestleMania 21"" all over again.

World Champion Edge vs. Rey Mysterio - This match was around 5 mins. but seeing how Rey had a serious injury that was made public on WWE's interview & pre-match interview, you could see why it was kept short.  Nothing really noteworthy here past that fact.

Afterwards, Big Show returned to WWE after over a year & looked in the best shape that anyone has seen him in years (he lost 108 lbs.).  Anyways, this lead to a confrontation between Show & Floyd Mayweather that resulted in Show bleeding from the nose & spitting blood after a series of punches.  It's Bam Bam/L.T. all over again.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena - This feud picked up where it left off in October but this match just seemed real slow & never got past first gear unlike their previous encounter at SummerSlam (that ""Unforgiven"" crap doesn't count).  From the start, the crowd was split & Cena was trying to score the quick win before Orton got control & focued on Cena's previously injured pectoral muscle before Cena countered.  The rest of the match was mostly each guy countering the others holds before Orton pulled off the same tactics that he's done to retain his championship throughout his title reign (Cyber Sunday for example) resulting in the ending which most didn't expected just based off the comments & predictions from this website's reviews alone when Cena won the Royal Rumble.  In the end, this match was just to continue the setup towards the WrestleMania title match.

Elimination Chamber Match: Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Umaga vs. J.B.L. -  Jericho & Michaels started until Umaga entered & dominated with moves such as a double Samoan Drop on Jericho & Michaels hitting his Samoan Wrecking Ball to Jericho through one of the pods later in the match.  Other moments to look out for here was the old school Jericho/Benoit ""Walls Of Jericho/Crossface"" combination done by Jericho & HBK onto Umaga, what J.B.L. did after being eliminated, Umaga's elimination before Jericho & Michaels got eliminated back to back, and the final minutes between Triple H & Jeff Hardy before Triple H finally got the victory with a pedigree on a chair.  Unlike the other chamber where everyone else was just a body to put over Taker & Batista, Umaga was re-established as a ""Samoan Bulldozer"" & Hardy was still put over strong in defeat.

The only DVD extra is Shawn Michaels meeting up with Ric Flair back in the locker room...which everyone knows by now was a tease for their upcoming Mania match.

In the end, the Chamber matches saved this show as the only good undercard match was the ECW Title match as the others should have been left off the card (Kennedy/Flair), had a guy who was injured & couldn't do much (Edge/Mysterio), and the only one that went over 10 mins. wasn't that good (Cena/Orton).  The whole event is watchable & it's not like any of these matches I wouldn't watch again but I recommend this for a rental for you to see for yourself & then decide from there if you thinking if it's worth getting.",1207180800,5,4768,4.616568047337278

Undertaker vs. Big Daddy V vs. Finlay vs. MVP vs. Great Khali vs. Batista: The reason why I wanted to watch the ppv.

Overall, a good card. Elimination Chambers are well worth it, espeically the ending the Smackdown Chamber match.",1206489600,,1312,4.553191489361702

No Way Out is a stop on the road to Wrestlemania and this year it is here that we find out who will win the elimination chamber matches and go forward to wrestlemania with a title shot for their respective brand. We will also find out if Mr. Kennedy can be the one to retire Flair, and if Cena can regain the championship that he never lost.

ECW Championship Match
CM Punk Vs. Chavo Guerrero (C)
This was a pretty good way to kick off the pay per view. It was a little short for me, I wish they could've given these guys at least five more minutes but it was still a good match. Rating 4/5

Elimination Chamber Match For World Title Shot At Wrestlemania
MVP Vs. Big Daddy V Vs. Khail Vs. Finlay Vs. Batista Vs. Undertaker
Elimination chambers are usually good and this one was no different. I was worried going into this match that Big Daddy V and Khali would drag it down but I think they actually served a pretty good purpose in this one. This was pretty much exciting all the way through I won't ruin it for those who haven't got a chance to watch yet but it keeps you guessing until the very end. Good match!! Rating 5/5

Career Threatening Match
Ken Kennedy Vs. Ric Flair
This was a good match, but I wish they could've gone about ten more minutes. I've seen better from both wrestlers but it wasn't a horrible match by any means, I just don't think it had enough time to develop into a classic. Rating 3/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Rey Mysterio Vs. Edge (C)
This match was way too short and a bit disappointing for me. I understand Mysterio is injured and I applaud him for going out there regardless. After the match Big Show makes his long anticipated WWE return and possibly sets up a wrestlemania encounter between him and the boxer Floyd Mayweather. Rating 3/5

WWE Championship
John Cena Vs. Randy Orton (C)
This was on its way to being a great match until the ending totally ruined it. It was still a good match but I would've preferred a clean finish, I'm not gonna spoil it for those who haven't watched yet but you will see what I'm talking about when you see it for yourself. Rating 4/5

Elimination Chamber Match For WWE Title Shot At Wrestlemania
HHH Vs. Umaga Vs. JBL Vs. Jeff Hardy Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Shawn Michaels
Great main event for the pay per view before Wrestlemania. Jeff Hardy is crazy and I can't believe he keeps putting his body on the line like he does sooner or later its going to catch up to him but for now its sure entertaining and fun to watch. The drama was nice leading up to the finish I won't spoil this for the peeps who haven't seen it but the winner doesn't surprise me thats for sure. Rating 5/5

No Way Out was a good pay per view I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to any WWE fan. Both elimination chambers were pretty good especially considering they had 2 of them in the same show. Man now I can't wait until Wrestlemania, should be interesting to see what kinds of twists and turns raw and smackdown hold in the coming weeks leading up to the big show.",1203379200,2,3086,4.286941580756014
1847025,5,B00008HCA1,"This year's No Way Out was a damn good PPV.

1) CM Punk vs. Chavo Guerrero for the ECW Championship- 6 out of 10- I've seen the two have better matches, but it was what it was- a curtain jerker to get the crowd going somewhat. Punk shouldn't have tried the Three Amigos, and the crowd let him have it for it deservingly. Chavo's paying homage to his uncle every time he does that. As a face, CM Punk could have mocked Chavo better. Chavo wins with Eddie's Frog Splash.

2) Undertaker wins the Smackdown! Elimination Chamber- 9.5 out of 10. Brutal match. Undertaker looked legitimately injured a few times in this match. If you liked Batista and Undertaker's matches in 2007, it's that plus two monster jobbers, a TO-rip off, and an Irishman who loves to fight. If for nothing else, check out this match for the last 6 minutes alone.

3) Ric Flair vs. Mr. Kennedy- 7 out of 10. The less said about Flair's wardrobe malfunction, the better. Good match, but it could have been better. Ric Flair wins for the 9,999th time with the Figure 4 Leg Lock. (That's not being sarcastic. That man's probably wrestled that much.)

4) Edge vs. Rey Mysterio- 4 out of 10. This was a PPV match? It even had a similar ending as the Royal Rumble match. The stuff that happened afterwards between The Big Show and Floyd Mayweather was great however.

5) Randy Orton vs. John Cena- 8 out of 10. Orton carried John Cena to a pretty decent match. Good drama, ring psychology, and timing by both men. Randy Orton has evolved into one hell of a wrestler and a heel. Randy Orton deserves this push, and it's a great swerve to allow him to keep the title heading into WrestleMania. As for Cena, am I the only one that thinks turning him heel would make more $$$ in the long run?

6) Triple H wins Raw Elimination Chamber- 9.5 out of 10. This was equally as brutal as the first. The MVP of this match was Umaga who took some pretty intense punishment. Jeff Hardy should have won, and if you notice the crowd reaction after Triple H wins, people were upset. Jeff is the one guy the new and old fans agree on. Give him the damned title! Otherwise, great match.

(Cena vs. Orton vs. Triple H will suck. Here's a quick spoiler: Randy Orton will be the jobber. And in all likelihood, Cena makes Orton tap out to the STFU to end yet another WrestleMania. How original. No matter how hard they push him, Cena doesn't draw like Austin, Rock, and doesn't even touch Hogan or Flair.)

I highly suggest this DVD for the sheer fact that there are two great Elimination Chamber matches on this.",1203206400,9,2553,4.40552016985138
1847026,4,B00008HCA1,"Chavo vs C.M Punk: Since Punk had some victories over Chavo for the last few weeks it was obvious he wasn't gonna win here. However this is still a pretty good opening match. I hope Punk is in the ECW Title match at WM. Maybe they could have Chavo vs Rey vs Punk vs Jeff Hardy at WM. Might as well give Jeff that belt since there's a bunch of glory hogs on Raw and Smackdown and since the main one just returned at the Royal Rumble. Anyway back to the match, Punk is in control on the top rope until Punk is knocked off and Chavo hits the frog Splash for the win. Winner and still champion: Chavo

  Smackdown Elimination Chamber: Starts out with Taker and Batista and then Big Daddy Useless comes in after awhile. Taker gets rid of him but I missed how, I closed my eyes quick I guess lol. Great Khali then comes in and after a few minutes he's gone too after Taker's new submission move ""that he beat Big Daddy V with on Smackdown"". Finlay comes in and hits his move on Undertaker after awhile but Taker kicks out. MVP is the last one in but not very long. He gets choke slammed off the chamber by Undertaker and Finlay gets the pin but basically just because Taker was too worn out to crawl over and make the pin. After awhile...yes Taker eliminates Finlay as well with a Chokeslam on the chamber floor. He goes at it with Batista for awhile until yes he hits the tombstone for the win. If it sounds like Undertaker owned the match then it's because he did basically. Still at least it's his first time winning and that he didn't win a few already unlike Triple H.

  Mr. Kennedy vs Ric Flair: Flair wins with the Figure Four, that's all I remember lol.

  Edge vs Rey: This one was shorter, yes shorter than Cena's match...much shorter. It sucks that better wrestlers from Smackdown have to have shorter World Championship matches than Cena when they are capable of better and longer matches than him. Anyway this one just isn't that long and Edge wins with no help at all. A slimmer Big Show returns and talks as a face and turns into a heel instantly when he man handles Rey. Then a little boxer that's friends with Rey runs in and punches Show when Show kneels in the ring thus busting Show's nose. It's gonna be incredibly silly if Show has to put this guy over at WM, I hope Show destroys him honestly.

  Cena vs Orton: I admit I was into the match eventhough I'd prefer if Cena was just still gone. But I was just into it because I was hoping he'd lose and that Jeff Hardy would actually get a World title push. Orton trys to get himself counted out and the ref won't count, then he hits the RKO on Cena outside and the ref takes forever to start counting. Cena comes back at 9 and Orton smirks and then punches the ref to get DQ'd. But don't worry the Poor Man's Stone Cold and the Rock will still be in the Mainevent at WM no doubt.

  Raw's Elimination Chamber: Starts out with Jericho and HBK. Then Umaga comes out and gives both an impressivle double samoa drop. The strength is impressive but that's about it lol. JBL then enters, then Triple, then Jeff Hardy. No one is eliminated until everyone is in the ring, then people start dropping like flys. Jericho gets rid of JBL first with his knees to the face move. Umaga is second after Jericho crawls over and pins him after Jeff hits a swanton bomb. Jericho is then nailed with Sweet Chin Music and Jeff pins Jericho. Triple H gets rid of HBK with the Pedigree. Triple H and Jeff go at it and Triple H hits the Pedigree and Jeff kicks out. Jeff should've won but no he loses when Triple H hits the pedigree on a chair just so he can hog the mainevent spot at yet another WM. Triple H vs Orton vs Cena is gonna suck as a WM mainevent.",1203206400,2,3701,4.229787234042553
1847027,5,B00008HCA1,"Today WWE makes history tonight as they will have 2 elimination chamber.

ECW championship match
Chavo Guerro vs CM Punk

This was a very nice opening match. Punk hit Chavo with some nice kicks. I liked how the crowd booed Punk when he tried to do the three amigos. Chavo s really showed how good of a wresatler he is and shows the he deserves to hold the belt. Overall 8/10

Elimination Chamber
This one is Smackdown and Ecws match. I really liked this one better than the main event. Undertaker got some good cheers in here. Big Daddy V showed how unstoppable he is. MVP was good in here to and took a nice fall frome one of the pod. Khali did his usual thing and the rest did good also. You'll also see hornswaggle. Good match, and match of the night for me. Overall 10/10

Ric Flair vs Mr, Kennedy

Pretty much a let down . Very average match. Kennedy worked on Rics leg. Boring. Overall 4/10

World Heavyweight match
Rey Mysterio vs Edge

They couldn't do much thanks to Reys injury but they tried. Wasn't much but they tried. Overall 5/10
WWE championship match
John Cena vs Randy Orton

This match was also a let down. Orton looked very stiff and cena did his usual things with a elbow drop in there. Orton really disappointed me not Cena. Two things why. Orton got himself dq and didn't really do enough to impress. I'm saying Cena didn't impress to but he is okay in entertaining. Overall 7/10

Raw Elimination Chamber

Pretty good Chamber match. Not as good as all the others but good. JBL got some good chair shots in their. HBK bled a lot. Hardy kept the crowd into him thru out. Umaga destroyed everyone and even slamed Y2J thru the glass with his butt The reason I thought smackdown and ecw chamber match was better because I think they used the chamber a lot better than raws match. Also because I thought it was a lot more funnier than raws but overall there both good . Overall 9.5/10

Overall good ppv and I'll add some more points because of the big shows return or should I say Paul `The great"" Whight",1203206400,,2021,4.362666666666667

70-66%-good

1. Jeff Hardy vs. Chris Jericho- This was the right choice to kick off the ppv. I would say that both men have good chemistry and a good fast pace match to kick off the ppv was good. Jericho controlled a lot of the early being with lots of solid wrestling and the crowd loved it 100%. Hardy fought back and even hit the Swanton bomb on Jericho but he ended up escaping that as well. A good battle with hardy tapping to the walls of Jericho which was cool. Winner Chris Jericho. Match Rating 7.5/10.
2. William Regal and Lance Strom vs. RVD and Kane for the world tag team titles- This was a decent tag team match. It almost seemed like a filler but I passed pretty well. RVD and kane controlled most of the match early but than reagl and storm fought back. There was some great tag team wrestling by storm and regal with some sick suplexs on RVD by regal. Kane got the tag but when storm and regal went to rip off the mask kane accidentally chock slammed RVD. Match Rating 6.5/10.
3. Billy Kidman vs. Matt Hardy for the cruiserweight title- This was yet another solid match. This was nothing but a nice 10 minute fast pace match. Not a lot to say here just some solid high flying moves and great cruiserweight wrestling by both men. Winner and new wwe cruiserweight champ Matt Hardy. Match Rating 7/10.
4. The Big Show vs. Undertaker- This had a great storyline behind it with big show taking out taker 3 months back and taker came back for revenge. I usually am not a big fan for the big man matches but this was a really good one. Big Show controlled a lot of it but taker fought back. Even A-Train tried to come down and interfere but was stopped by taker. He got back in the ring and was chock slammed by the big show but he reversed it into a sick chock hold and he chock out big show. Sweet stuff right here. Winner Undertaker. Match Rating Rating 7/10.
5. Brock Lesnar, Chris Beniot, Edge vs. Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, vs. Charlie Haas- This ended up being a 3 on 2 handicap match because Edge was taken out back stage before the match. With Edge out this match it became a huge technical wrestling match. In this match tons of suplexs and tons of mat work. This match flowed really well as sometime handicap matches don't go so well but this one was awesome with tons of near falls. Winners Brock Lesnar and Chirs Beniot. Match Rating 8.5/10.
6. HHH vs. Scott Stiner for the World Heavyweight Title- This was a good match. A lot of the crowd was against stiner in this match and were even chanting boring but it was not boring. This started out with stiner working on the leg of HHH. Than it turned into a little bit of a brawl with lots of shots to the steel steps. There was interference by evolution that led to a shot to the head by HHH on stiner but he kicked out. Winner andstill WHC HHH. Match Rating 7.5/10.
7. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Eric Bishoff- This is not really a match. This was more of Stone Cold coming back to ppv and kicking Eric Bishoffs A**. This is more of a segment some what entertaining but not really need on the card. Winner Stone Cold Steve Austin. Match Rating 3/10.
8. The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan 2- This was not as good as there first match at wrestlemania 18. I was not expecting this to be better but I was hoping it would still live up to the hype. This was still a good match but seemed a little rushed. There were a lot of near falls and a weird but kind of smart ending with a Vince screwjob which set up Hogan Mcmahon for wrestlemania 19. Winner The Rock. Match Rating 7/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give NO Way Out 2003 a grade of 54/80 which is a 68% which means this is a good ppv. I would recommend this DVD if you could get it off Ebay for a cheaper price. Not a bad dvd and a lot of solid matches. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1184889600,,3929,4.230359520639148
1847036,4,B00008HCA1,"For the first time since Survivor Series '97, WWE returned to PPV in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with it's last stop before WrestleMania XIX for No Way Out...and you can bet your money that someone is going to get ""screwed"" before the night is over.

Jeff Hardy vs. Chris Jericho - It was originally suppost to be Test but Hardy replaced him less than a week before the event.  This was actually Jeff Hardy's last WWE PPV event & this match had Jeff actually putting in a good effort against Jericho who had the canadian crowd on his side.  Good opener but the real highlight was the aftermath involving Shawn Michaels & the crowd reaction to HBK coming down to ringside.  Boy, these canadian fans don't forget anything...even if it's over 5 years later.

World Tag Team Champions Lance Storm & William Regal vs. Kane & RVD - This match looks mismatched on paper with all the different styles between the four men involved but actually came off pretty well.  The ending was a little cheap (Kane gets his masked twisted around) but it didn't take away from an above average match.

Crusierweight Champion Billy Kidman vs. Matt Hardy - Taking away the funny storyline of Hardy losing weight to qualify for the title match...the match was fast paced & not boring without it being a spotfest as Matt Hardy won the Crusierweight title.

Undertaker vs. Big Show - Anyone who says this match is boring is probably just not a fan of a ""big man vs. big man"" match as they actually had a good match with Undertaker pulling out some new moves that you would see in mixed martial arts federations like UFC.  Big Show held his own here as a monster as well.

Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit vs. Team Angle - WWE knew that Edge wasn't going to be able to wrestler in this match but they went ahead & advertised it anyway but had someone take out Edge backstage (and we still don't know who did it to this day) making this a handicap match.  A great match here with all five participants as it build up the tease of what to expect from Angle/Brock WM main event even more.  This is mostly highlighted as the match that started to give Kurt Angle neck problems as you see during one point where Brock drops Angle on the top turnbuckle & Kurt went down for over a minute.  Nobody in this match missed a beat eventhough Edge couldn't participate.

World Champion Triple H vs. Scott Steiner - Boy, the crowd gave this match the most heat of the night.  First, they were booing Steiner & then eventually turned on the match itself.  It was better than their match the month before at the Rumble only because it didn't go as long but this match was just to further establish Triple H's group of Evolution as they cost Steiner the belt in the end.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Eric Bischoff - You've heard Austin say that he's gonna open up a can of whoop-ass plenty of times...but here's what he means when say that.  Austin completely destroyed Bischoff with Jim Ross (who was injured by Bischoff the week earlier on RAW) on commentary yelling non-stop.  And Austin gave Bischoff stunner after stunner.  The Rattlesnake was back!

Hollywood Hogan vs. The Rock - This is a match for those to watch that says The Rock is a horrible wrestler because The Rock carried this match as Hogan didn't do much as he did limited moves to offset The Rock's offense & get the crowd to pop.  This match just like the previous Triple H/Steiner match was just a backdrop to further develop a storyline in which Mr. McMahon ended up using a referee to screw the hero (Hogan) out of a victory in Montreal, Canada...sounds like deja vu doesn't it?  Overall, this was an entertaining match thanks The Rock's efforts but if your expecting the same type of match they had a WrestleMania then don't get your hopes up.

Overall, there really wasn't a bad match on this card as all the matches on here were solid & none were below average.  I recommend.",1181001600,,3900,4.490084985835694

1. Basham Brothers vs. Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio(WWE Tag Team Championship)

This was a great tag team match. Eddie and Rey can steal the show one-on-one, and apparantly they can do it as a tag team. There was a good mixture of fast-paced high-flying action and slow-paced pure wrestling. 9 out of 10.

2. Booker T vs. Heidenreich

This was basically a filler,and it showed. It had the potential to be decent,but it just lagged on too much and the DQ ending hurt it. 5 out of 10.

Paul London vs. Akio vs. Spike Dudley vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Shannon Moore vs. Funaki

This was a good Cruiserweight match with big moves, but it just felt like some people got eliminated too quickly. 8 out of 10.

4. Luther Reigns vs. Undertaker

This was a typical big man match, with power moves and slower action. I think that Luther should have gotten a bigger push because he had potential. 7 out of 10.

Rookie Diva Contest

Joy Giovanni vs. Rochelle Loewen vs. Michelle McCool vs. Lauren Jones

This was a contest throughout the night. You could tell that Joy would win because of the crowd's reactions. There was an evening gown contest,talent contest and a swimsuit contest. 10 out of 10.(Just because of the hot girls)

5. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle(Winner becomes #1 contender at Wrestlemania)

This was an excellent match. These two have good coordination together in the ring, and it shows in this match. I also liked what Eddie Guerrero said to Cena earlier in the night. It was inspirational. Outstanding performance between these two great competitors. 10 out of 10.

6. First-Ever barbed wire steel cage match(WWE Championship)

JBL vs. Big Show

This was a good attempt at a first-ever match, and I think they should have more of these matches. It was brutal. When JBL looked for an opening through the barbed wire, his wrist got cut open.

The ending was very unexpected and I liked what happened after the match. The match was highlited by a chokeslam through the ring off the top rope. It wasn't a perfect match, and I think that they could improve on this type of match. 9 out of 10.",1140220800,3,2248,4.633838383838384

-What did Teddy Long do to deserve being Smackdown GM? If you guys still remember the night he was announced as GM, everybody hated him. He hasn't done one good thing for SmackDown. Now the upcoming pay per view is No way out, sm has no good talents so they have to take Kane to be the main eventer with that stupid champ Batista. This batista is not the batista we had seen in Evolution. The changed, not an animal anymore. And hes got a back injury, he cant carry smackdown.

1847068,3,B00008HCA1,"No Way Out Opener:

No Way Out opened up with a video package looking at the Barbwire Steel Cage Match between JBL and the Big Show for the WWE Championship. Tonight, there is No Way Out. The fireworks then went off in the arena as Michael Cole and Tazz welcomed us to the show.

1st match: The Basham Brothers (C) vs. Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Tag Team Championship:

The Finish:

The Basham's took control with a double spinebuster for two and then went for a double suplex but Rey broke it and Eddie got a small package for two. Eddie went outside and grabbed a belt and then Rey stopped him. Eddie went for a the frogsplash on Danny, and then tried to fool Danny into thinking he crashed and burned, and then rolled up Danny for two. Danny tossed the belt to Eddie, who then tossed it to Doug and then Eddie got the other belt from Mysterio and knocked down Doug with it. Rey then hit Danny with the 619 and Eddie covered Doug for the win!  A decent enough match which pretty much made Smackdown! until October.

Winners via Pinfall: Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero

Rating: 6/10

Backstage:

Carlito threatened to get Teddy Long fired and Long said he was trying to get Batista.

2nd match: Lauren Jones vs. Michelle McCool vs. Joy Giovanni vs. Rochelle Loewen in the Rookie Diva Contest - First Round Evening Gown Competition:

Tony Chimel said voting is now open on [...] as the Diva's paraded in their Evening Gowns and Round Two is coming up! Nice waste of five minutes. Really, why?

3rd match: Booker T vs. Heidenreich:

Booker sent Heidenreich into the steps but Heidenreich picked up a chair and sent it into the throat of Booker T for the Disqualification.  I wasn't expectating much from the match and I didn't get much.

The Finish:

Chavo went for a neck breaker but London held onto the ropes. London hit a Dragon Suplex for two. London got his second wind and hit a back body drop and then the dropsault for two. Chavo came back and sent London into the buckle and London got a small package but Chavo reversed and grabbed the ropes for leverage for the win!  A cheap finish.

5th match: Lauren Jones vs. Michelle McCool vs. Joy Giovanni vs. Rochelle Loewen in a Talent Contest:

Second round time, as Tony Chimel introduced the Diva's again. Torrie got on the mic and welcomed us to round two. She said each Diva is going to show us their very special talents. Joy said her talent was massage, and she would like to massage Torrie. Joy started to massage Torrie and Dawn looked on in disgust. Torrie thanked Joy, and then Dawn got on the mic and said that she can give a better rub than that. Rochelle was next and told a couple of jokes, and she was horrid. Dawn stole the mic off her and told her she stunk. Lauren was next and did a dance. I am so glad this show was free in the UK. Dawn said Lauren shouldn't quit her day job. Michelle was next and said her talent is a bit more physical. She said that she is tired of Dawn running her mouth, and then gave her a bodyslam! Torrie laughed and Chimel told us to go vote.

Taker hit the Chokeslam on Reigns and then looked to the crowd and called for the Tombstone but Reigns slid off the back and then hit the Roll of the Dice for two! Reigns went to work with mounted punches on the mat and went for it again but the Undertaker reversed into a DDT. The Undertaker then hit the Tombstone and made the cover for the win.  Another match I knew the outcome.

Joy was first, followed by Rochelle, then Lauren and finally Michelle. The crowd is pretty dead through all of this by the way. Michelle did a back flip and stuff. Torrie said while the votes are tallied on [...], she is going to poll the audience. Michelle got the biggest pop from the crowd. The [...] votes show Joy as the winner.  The biggest waits of time....EVER!!!!

Winner via votes: Joy Giovanni

Winner via Pinfall: John Cena

Rating: 7/10

Main Event: John Bradshaw Layfield (c) vs. The Big Show for the WWE Championship in a Barb Wire Steel Cage Match:

The Big Show looked down at JBL's lifeless body and then climbed down. Show went to the door and started kicking at it and then hit pulled off the padlock! Show opened the door and started to climb out and Big Show is out of the cage!!! The Big Show is going to WrestleMania! Tony Chimel then announced the JBL is still WWE Champion, and JBL was shown on the outside! How did JBL get out? Cole then said that JBL crawled through the hole in the mat, under the ring to the outside and JBL has retained his championship!  A bad ending.

Winner via escape: John Bradshaw Layfield

Rating: 6/10

The Aftermath:

The Big Show grabbed JBL and knocked him down but the Cabinet hit the ring and kicked away at the Big Show. The music of Batista then hit in the arena and he ran down the aisle and took down the Basham's and then hit a spinebuster or Jordan, and then bother Basham Brothers.

Cena hit the FU on JBL through a table and through steel beams. The music of Cena then hit in the arena and Cole said it's going to be a triple threat match between these three men at WrestleMania! Cena and Batista then stared at each other as the show went off the air.

Match of the Night: Cena vs. Angle

Worst Match of the Night: Booker T vs. Heidenreich

Best Move of the Night: The Chokeslam through the ring!

Overall: Despite all the ripping of this event, I think it is worth a buy.  It is better then SummerSlam in my opinion.  Get this one!",1127692800,3,7577,4.388809182209469
1847069,2,B00008HCA1,"This is a pretty average ppv that shouldnt get 5 star reviews from any reasonable fan,

I was live in my hometown of Montreal to watch it, i thought it reeked of awesomeness, however when i bought the dvd i saw just how bad/average it really was.

Hardy vs. Jericho- Definatly Match of the night. Jeff Hardy gave a great preformance(which is rare for him) the only time ive seen hardy give 100% other than here was vs. Bobby roode at Unbreakable but nevermind about that, I liked the pace of the match and these two work well together. 8.5/10

Storm and Regal vs. Kane and RVD- Awful match, mainly due to Regal getting injured and Kane's subpar inring ability and the lack of Van Dams offense, And the end is just stupid. 4/10

Kidman vs. Hardy- good match, nothing specacular but nothing bad either, Kidman impresses here and i think Hardy did alrgiht too. 7/10

Undertaker vs. Big SHow- Man, even with the live excitement i found this awful, just like when i saw the dvd. Why they didn't make this a Casket match i shall never know, Cause when you got two guys with very low in ring ability, a stipulation is usually your only hope, 3/10

 (now the event skyrockets!...downwards that is)

Lesnar and Benoit vs, Team angle- Pretty good match, if they just subed Eddie with Edge than we couldve had a great mat match, Honestly Haas is so underrated and it makes me excited to see what he can do in a TNA ring. 8/10

HHH vs. Scott Stiener- Umm how about no, lets leave this match at that, No. 2/10

Austin vs, Bishoff- well, are you expecting a Mat classic? 1/10(WHy people are giving this 10000/10 is beyond me, even if it was fun to watch)

ROck vs. Hogan II- meh, i didn't care for the match, basically it was a brawl with about 3 wrestling moves, Rock winning was a pleasent surprise.  But this match getting such high reviews is an honest to god joke. 6.5/10

This PPV gets 40/80 50%, which in any books is a failiure, However The dvd does have some good extras so i would say a rental or a buy if you can find it under 15 dollars.",1127520000,2,2035,4.323684210526316

1847080,3,B00008HCA1,"No Way Out has always been a middle of the road PPV (with maybe the possible exception of 2001's edition which ended a few rivalries). The 2005 No Way Out felt like a below average PPV which really just serves as a road block.  However, the action was alright, with a few notable matches.

1) Eddie and Rey versus the Bashams- 8/10- It was a good opening match with some good tag team action. The stuff with Rey and Eddie towards the end is pretty good. The Bashams aren't exactly the greatest tag team in the world, but they did what was necessary to have a decent match. Watch for some typical Eddie stuff in the match.

2)The Divas segments-2/10 (2 for eye candy)- I kept thinking to myself how much better the matches would have been if the time for these rediculous segments would have gone into WRESTLING! If you want to see this stuff, please buy the latest SI swimsuit video or something.  The support for this crap is rediculous. If these chicks could wrestle, then this might be an acceptible thing. But they can't.....therefore it's not!

3)Heidenreich vs. Booker T- 4/10- I feel sorry for Booker. 2 months before this, he was in the WWE title hunt on 2 consecutive PPVs. This match just shows to me how Booker and RVD are being underutilized on TV. Please Vince (I'm sorry....Triple H), push these guys. Heidenreich's gimmick is stupid enough to pair him with Eugene. Actually, that might not be such a bad idea.

4) The 6-Man Elimination Cruiserweight Title Match- 8/10- Excellent match.....this coming from a guy who hates the cruiserweights. This was actually a good contest. The pace was quick, the moves were pretty cool, and the match served a purpose for storyline sakes. My only complaint is that......well, I won't spoil it. But if you watched Smackdown right after this aired, you already know what I mean.

5) Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns- 6/10- I usually love any match the Deadman is in. His match with Heidenreich the previous month was great.  But this one really was bad.  Not as bad as Heidenreich/Booker T but just bad. Even Taker couldn't carry Luther Reigns in the ring and Taker's carried a lot of dead weight (no pun intended) in his past matches.

6) Kurt Angle vs. John Cena- 8/10- Good Match. I think these two have had better matches between each other (No Mercy 2003 comes to mind). But Kurt Angle is great as usual. Cena was pretty good as well. I thought the ending was pretty weak, and a stronger one could have made Cena look better in the eyes of the fans. This ending just makes Cena a winner by lucky circumstance.

7) JBL vs. Big Show- 8/10- Why such a high rating? One, I actually thought the match wasn't that half bad. Two, JBL took some shots in that cage. Three, the spot that occurred during the match. And fourth, because The Big Show and JBL both couldn't ""lose"" this match.  The Big Show is the biggest athlete ever in WWE and the most agile at his size. Andre couldn't even move faster than a turtle, let alone fly off ropes. JBL was the champ who had a face waiting for him at WM 21.  The ending was a copout in order to secure both men's statures: JBL as the winner by lucky circumstance (I'm using that a lot if you notice) and The Big Show as the dominant man who in all that's right should have won. The ending with Batista and Cena joining the frey was great, but it really didn't add anything to Batista as he went on to face/destroy HHH at Mania.

No Way Out was an ok show. There were some good matches, but there were also 2 bad ones and a stupid divas segment that should have been replaced by a match. If you look at the final total, I gave it a 44/70 which comes out to a rough 63%. I can't say this is a great PPV or anything like that, but I think it's worth a look. I'd just skip the 3 things I just got done describing.",1119312000,2,3793,4.376955903271693

1 - 10 - Abysmal. An appalling PPV - This is just a waste of time.

NO WAY OUT 2005:

2005 Diva Rookies Competition: 1/10

This was really a waste of time. This took up so much time that a great match could have been added instead of it. Pointless.

Booker T vs. Heidenreich: 3/10

This was really like a boring smackdown match. This match was clearly just thrown in to pass the time. The worst match of the PPV.

WWE Tag Team Titles Match

The Basham Brothers vs. Eddie Guerrero & Rey Mysterio: 5/10

An average match. Nothing special from any of the wrestlers, I've seen them all perform much better matches on smackdown. Slow-paced and bad as far as tag team matches go.

WWE Cruiserweight Title Elimination Match

Funaki vs. Paul London vs. Akio vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Shannon Moore vs. Spike Dudley: 6/10

I expected a lot more from this. With cruiserweights I expected a fast-paced, high-flying match but this match was a disappointment. One or two good spots but overall a disappointment. Each wrestler was eliminated way too fast.

WrestleMania WWE Title Shot On The Line

Kurt Angle vs. John Cena: 7/10

Probably the best match of the night and it was nothing special. It just didn't feel like a ppv match, i personally don't think that both men gave it their all. Had a few good spots but once again i expected more from a ppv.

The Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns: 5/10

Once again a horribly average match. Nothing great about it at all. Just felt like watching a smackdown mid-card match. Another match just thrown in to pass the time of this terrible ppv.

WWE Title Barbed Wire Cage Match

John Bradshaw Layfield vs. The Big Show: 6.5/10

Don't get your hopes up, the barbed wire is NOT used and the cage is barely used at all. If you take out the barbed wire this was still a lousy cage match. Two big guys, a slow match, most of the moves were just chops and punches. The JBL spot through the ring did surprise me but that was the only exciting part of the match.

SCORE: 33.5/70 (48/100)

According to the key i have rated this PPV as 'Mediocre', a dull PPV and perhaps you should take a look at this if you get a chance, I don't recommend it though. I agree with this. Nothing special about this PPV.",1118793600,,3004,4.224956063268893

Holly is improving & is getting the fans behind him. Haas & Holly make a good tag team. this one should have been on the ppv instead of the divas.

WWE Tag Team Championship

Basham Brothers vs Eddie Guerrero & Rey Mysterio 8.5/10- a much better match than anticipated. Guerrero & Mysterio carry the Bashams to a very good match. a great ending is what really helps this one.

great interaction between Carlito Carribean Cool & Theodore Long.

Rookie Diva Search 2005

Evening Gown, Talent & Swimsuit Competitions

Joy Giovanni vs Rochelle Loewn vs Lauren Jones vs Michelle McCool( Hosts: Torrie Wilson & Dawn Marie) 3/10- a basic waste of good ppv time. the only interesting thing was Marie's critical comments & confrontation with McCool.

Wrestlemania 21 Trailer- Pulp Fiction spoof with Eddie Guerrero & Booker T was hilarious.

Heidenreich vs Booker T 2/10- horrible, boring snoozefest. these 2 don't work well together. Heiden only works well with the Undertaker. Booker looked tired & disenchanted. sorry ending didn't help either.

great backstage gathering with Rey Mysterio, Eddie Guerrero, Charlie Haas, Hardcore Holly & John Cena. a must see conversation between Guerrero & Cena.

WWE Cruiserweight Championship

6 Man Elimination Match

Funaki vs Spike Dudley vs Paul London vs Akio vs Chavo Guerrero vs Shannon Moore 7/10- a good concept but pinfalls happened too quick. this whole thing was over in 10 minutes. a great performance by one of the guys. they should have held the guys in the back until their turn instead of all of them being at ringside. Moore's "" Prince Of Punk"" gimmick is lame & London's Indian heritage is overdone. he sort of acts like the Ultimate Warrior. screwjob ending hurts this one.

Wrestlemania Recall: Gimmick Battle Royal @ Wrestlemania 16.

great interview by JBL. reminds you of Stan Hansen.

Luther Reigns vs Undertaker 6/10- not a very good match. nothing spectacular. Mark Jindrak is thrown out by the referee. an average match.

Wrestlemania 21 Trailer- Basic Instinct spoof with Stacy Keibler, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Christian, Mae Young & Fabulous Moolah is funny.

Tournament Final- # 1 Contender's Match for WWE Championship

Kurt Angle vs John Cena 9/10- a great match between these 2. the best of the night. Cena had to beat Orlando Jordan & Booker T to get here. Angle had to beat Rey Mysterio & received a bye into the finals.

WWE Championship

Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match

WWE Smackdown Presents No Way Out 2005
February 20, 2005
Mellon Arena
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

1. Basham Brothers vs. Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio
WWE Tag Team Championships
This match was a pretty good opener. Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio showed a great performance in this match. The best part was when Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio won the Tag Team Titles. 4/5

2. Booker T vs. Heidenreich
This match was a waste of time. When I bought this DVD, I skipped this match. I watched the match after and it was so boring, I fell asleep. 1/5

3. Six Man Cruiserweight Championship
Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Spike Dudley vs. Shannon Moore vs. Akio vs. Funaki
This match was one of the best matches on the card. Paul London probably showed the best performance in this match with lasting four of the five guys that he was against. He defeated Funaki, Spike Dudley, Shannon Moore and Akio. Chavo sucks and won the match. Although it was a good match. 4.5/5

4. Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns
This match was an okay match. I thought that it was a little boring for a while, but it started to get better once it started going on and going on. Undertaker won the match and that was the best part. 3.5/5

5. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle
Winner gets a shot at Wrestlemania 21 for the WWE Championship
This was the best match at the Pay Per View. John Cena and Kurt Angle both showed some astonishing performances in the match. When John Cena got the F-U on Kurt Angle, I thought that the match had ended. Although, Kurt Angle kicked out and got John Cena with the Ankle Lock. John Cena held on and didn't tap out and got to the ropes. John Cena got another F-U on Kurt Angle and finally won the match. John Cena will face either Big Show or J.B.L at Wrestlemania 21. 5/5

6. Rookie Diva Competition
Joy vs. Rochelle vs. Lauren vs. Michelle
This competition was prettty good. Joy and Michelle were the hottest girls there. Joy won the Competition and is the Rookie Diva of the year. 3/5

7. 1st Ever Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match
WWE Championship
JBL vs. Big Show
This match was pretty good and one of the best ones on the card. They never really used the barbed wire, but getting thrown through the ring was the best part. JBL won another damn match. After, John Cena came out and kicked JBL's ass. Now, it will be JBL vs. John Cena at Wrestlemania. 5/5

Overall, the Pay Per View was 26/35 which equals to 74% in total which adds up to be a pretty good Pay Per View for No Way Out.",1115683200,2,2628,4.32520325203252

CHRIS JERICHO defeated JEFF HARDY: Good opener that was an improvement on their Raw match from 2 weeks ago, mainly because it was given more time. Nothing really special happened, but it was entertaining enough to watch. The correct man won, and while it would have been interesting if HBK interfered during the match, the aftermatch free-for-all involving Michaels & Christian was sufficient. Bring on WrestleMania for what could be the defining moment in Chris Jericho's career. Match Rating...7

LANCE STORM & WILLIAM REGAL defeated ROB VAN DAM & KANE to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: Good tag-team bout that ended when Storm rearranged Kane's mask so that he couldn't see clearly, thus resulting in him choke-slamming RVD. Interesting idea, as it leaves plenty of room for flexibility & unpredictability in the RVD-Kane storyline. I'm not as critical of the Storm & Regal teaming as most people are, but I can't see them in their current personas holding the titles until WrestleMania. Give them the microphone for goodness sake. Match Rating...7

MATT HARDY defeated BILLY KIDMAN to Win the CruiserWeight Title: Hate to be boring folks, but this was another 'good' match, that was nothing special. It threatened to spark into a great cruiserweight bout at various times, but never really did. Kidman did his job, as did Matt. But something between the 2 just didn't click. Maybe it was the lack of animosity or a feud. The ball is with the entertaining Hardy now. Let's hope he can run with it, so that some much needed enthusiasm can be planted into this division. Match Rating...7

THE UNDERTAKER defeated THE BIG SHOW: Here was the surprise of the night. This match was genuinely 'good'. There's that word (& rating for that matter) again. I had no idea of TBS' injury prior to this match. The story that was told was excellent though, as The Undertaker consistently failed to lift TBS in a number of different ways. The crowd was right behind the freshened up Taker, and he seemed invigorated by it. The arsenal of moves varied sufficiently enough, resulting in a decent ending involving a triangle choke. Match Rating...7

CHRIS BENOIT & BROCK LESNAR defeated KURT ANGLE, CHARLIE HAAS & SHELTON BENJAMIN: It's so easy to get complacent watching these guys perform. At the end of the day, this was still the match of the night. A little strangely paced at times, it was slightly hurt because of the absence of Edge. But all 5 performers did what they had to do very well, resulting in an overall very good match. Benoit is almost there as a main-event face, and it is for this reason that I really fear Austin going to SmackDown. Match Rating...8

TRIPLE H defeated SCOTT STEINER to Retain the World Heavyweight Title: Here I go again, calling it the way I see it & probably being in the minority. The Royal Rumble match between these 2 was better than this one. There was just no entertainment value to be found here. So what if Steiner is a little fitter now and this match was a little shorter. At the end of the day, I got a few laughs out of their initial encounter, while this bout was almost a duplicate, and added nothing but confusion from the crowd. While it may end the feud, nothing was furthered here. A further point off the rating for not having Booker T run in at some point. Match Rating...4

STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN defeated ERIC BISCHOFF: This wasn't so much a match, but rather a segment. Why on earth Vince made the stipulation before the match that anyone who interfered would be fired is beyond me. It would have been more entertaining if Austin stunned numerous wrestlers, rather than just squash Bischoff. The return was effective I suppose, and the crowd ate it up. It will be interesting to see if Austin tweaks his character a little when handed the microphone. Match Rating...5

THE ROCK defeated HOLLYWOOD HULK HOGAN: A very hard match to rate, this started off strangely with that weird helicopter intro that Rocky now has. I've never been a huge fan of The Rock's wrestling repertoire, but he basically carried Hogan in this bout. I like the way he's added just enough of a twist to his previous heel character. This results in freshness, even if it is only a perception. The match itself was pretty average, but entertaining enough. I didn't mind the screwjob ending involving a new referee & Vince McMahon. It made sense & adds to The Rock's heel persona, without really taking anything away from Hogan. Vince came out afterwards to show us his muscles & hype his match with Hogan at WrestleMania 19. Match Rating...6

PPV RATING (51/80) = 64

Looking at the key, I have basically given No Way Out a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'worth a watch'. I'm happy with that overall grade & comment. You see, No Way Out's position on the calendar should never make it a stand-out pay-per-view. This is because that properly setting up feuds for WrestleMania will predominantly mean that some matches at this event will not have an opportunity to deliver the quality that us fans always expect. Having said that, this was a solid show that is definitely worth watching. It succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do. The only real things it lacked, was a standout match to boost the rating, and appearances from the always entertaining Rey Mysterio & Booker T.",1114732800,,5829,4.687866927592955

EDDIE GUERRERO & REY MYSTERIO defeated THE BASHAM BROTHERS to Win the WWE Tag-Team Championships: Solid & generally entertaining 15 minute opener. The Bashams dominated the first half of the bout & disappointingly didn't really step up their offense. They were solid, but just too unspectacular. The innovative hot tag from Rey to Eddie obviously got the pace picked up. And from that point onwards, there was a very good mixture of wrestling, spots & storytelling. Clever, and even unpredictable, win to the faces capped it all off nicely. The bout achieved it's purposes as an opener, and even makes us look towards WrestleMania 21 with some optimism as it pertains to a tag title match. Match Rating...7

BOOKER T defeated HEIDENREICH by Disqualification: Plodding 7 minute match which almost felt like it was between two 7 footers. Standard offense for the entire duration of the bout. Nothing actually too terrible, but so unimaginative that it showed out way too clearly. When the most entertaining thing about a match is listening to Heidenreich babble to himself, you know something is wrong. I was thinking about passing it, but the weak DQ ending made sure I didn't. Match Rating...4

CHAVO GUERRERO defeated PAUL LONDON, AKIO, SHANNON MOORE, SPIKE DUDLEY & FUNAKI in a Gauntlet Elimination Match to Win the Cruiserweight Title: Where do I begin with the bad booking here? 5 pins in 10 minutes pretty much says it all. It must be remembered that being a guantlet match, it basically meant that each pinfall was gained in a singles bout. Just a whole bunch of poor booking decisions because of this; (a) The reigning champ being pinned in a 2 minute singles match. (b) Neither Funaki, Spike or Moore could last 2 minutes in a singles match. (c) The soft elimination of Akio. And (d) when they still had heaps of time, only 3 minutes was given to what still could have been a great London vs Chavo finale. Obviously, the pace was still great & there were a couple of neat spots. But if anything, some of the little touches from London saved this. Thankfully, I think we can look forward to what should be a great Chavo vs London feud. Match Rating...5

THE UNDERTAKER defeated LUTHER REIGNS: What the hell was I doing predicting a Luther win here? I must have been out of my mind. Disappointing 12 minute match & I'm almost tempted to just write ""See Comments for Booker T vs Heidenreich Match, except for the DQ ending"". In fact, I just did & have nothing much further to add. Oh yeah, Jindrak got himself kicked out of the match before it started & it almost looked like it was intentional... So could a possible face turn be coming for Jindrak? If anything, the rating is kind. Match Rating...5

JOY GIOVANNI Won a Rookie Diva of the Year Contest: This was split up into 3 separate contests throughout the night & 15 minutes was used up in total. That is just far too long, especially considering that (a) not a great deal happened, especially in the first 4 minute segment, and (b) what could have been a great cruiserweight match was only given 10 minutes. Joy wins because the fans didn't know who the other 3 ladies were. Match Rating...2

JOHN CENA defeated KURT ANGLE to Become the #1 Contender for the WWE Championship: It was interesting to note that Cena did not show us his freestyling skills before the bout. I presume this was due to fears that he would get booed in Angle's hometown. The match started off well with Kurt schooling Cena in the first few minutes, but Cena working back into the bout with his more generic professional wrestling style. This then transitioned well into a good combination of both by the 2 men. While Angle did carry the match, Cena held his own & even added a couple of new moves to his repertoire (a top-rope legdrop & a slam variation). Things wisely changed direction at the 14 minute mark when Kurt kicked out of the F-U & went to town on Cena's knee & ankle. But when he got a little carried away thinking about using Cena's chain, a 2nd F-U at the 19 minute mark got the job done.

Solid & well put together match, which came off really naturally. As with most bouts that come off naturally (EG: WM12 Iron Man match), it did need something spectacular to cap it off, but unfortunately that didn't come. While Cena does need to further improve in the ring, he proved that he can still have a great match with a quality opponent. It was also pleasing to see a clean win with no HBK run-in. That rating may be a tad kind, but this was genuinely good. Match Rating...8

JOHN BRADSHAW LAYFIELD defeated THE BIG SHOW in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match to Retain the WWE Championship: As expected, this was a rather slow-paced, bloody & prototypical cage match, and if anything, the barbed wire actually restricted the combatants further. Standard stuff where I don't really have much to say other than concerning the clever ending; JBL was chokeslammed through the mat from the top rope, and while TBS was breaking the padlock on the door, JBL (being out of camera-shot) crawled underneath the ring to the floor. 15 minutes in total, but no more than 12 in actual action. More of a tv main event, rather than a ppv. Match Rating...6

PPV RATING (37/70) = 53

Looking at the key, I have basically given the 2005 version of No Way Out a 'D' grade & said that it was 'mediocre & disappointing'. I'll stick by those comments. A case can be argued that it was neither due to being either better or worse than that. But I thought that the event as a whole definitely wasn't bad enough to receive a failing grade, but was disappointing in that it could have been a fair bit better. At least 3 matches could have rated 2-3 rating points higher. This may be a record, but for the 3rd time in this review, I really don't have much more to say. And I think that probably says a lot about the event.",1114732800,,6418,4.538062283737024

No Way Out Card:

2/10

3. Heidenreich vs. Booker T

Velocity quality match, only 6 minutes, Booket T wins by DQ after Heidenreich hits him in the throat with a steel chair. Booker T deserves a better opponent. Heidenreiech is a boring and terrible wrestler.

0/10

4.6-man elimination match for the WwE Cruiserweight Title

Funaki vs. Shannon Moore vs. Spike Dudley vs. Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Akio

This is just like the cruiserweight open match at Wrestle Mania 20.

London rolls up and pins the cruiserweight champ after spike interferes

2. Spike Dudley vs. Paul London

Funaki comes in immediately and knocks out Spike with a super kick and London pins him.

7. The 1st ever Barbed-Wire Steel Cage Match in WWE for the WWE Championship

The Big Show vs. JBL

The Bashams and Orlando Jordan interfere, but are thrown out by Theodore Long. JBL hits Show with Clippers that The Bashams brought in to break through the cage. I think the Barbed Wire was never even used, which ticked me off. Very bloody and brutal match though. JBL gets chokeslammed from the top turn buckle and amazingly goes trough the ring, but crawls out before Show can get out and JBL retains. After, Batista comes out and beats the crap out of The Bashams and Orlando Jordan while Cena beats up JBl.

Smackdown tries to revolve around the same guys: Angle, Guerrero, Cena, Bradshaw, Taker and the Show.

Of Course their matches are good, but the rest of the show its just a once to watch, then just look at the match you like. (usually the main event)

Im sick of seeing the same old matches, I think Angle has fought the Big Show like 150 times!! And has had 200 title shots, failing to be WWE Champion!!

Anyway, if you are a Smackdown fan, the show is enterteining, getting better than last year, but still way far from RAW's PPV's.",1111104000,,655,4.425
1847122,2,B00008HCA1,"CAN SMACKDOWN! PUT ON A GOOD PPV??????  PLEASE!!!!!  Here is the order of what I think the card should be.

BOOKER T vs. HEIDENREICH

On this night, Heidenreich only added to his reputation as an unstable lunatic.

After a fairly even match spilled outside of the ring and near the announcers' table, a frustrated Heidenreich took a steel chair and brutally rammed it into the throat of Booker T, leading to the obvious disqualification of the insane poet.

The bad blood between these Superstars started simply enough on the last SmackDown! before No Way Out.

After Booker was defeated by John Cena in the semifinals of the No. 1 Contender's Tournament, he noticed Heidenreich laughing backstage. Booker T took issue with Heidenriech's good mood, ultimately leading to this last-minute addition to the pay-per-view card.

And considering how their match ended in Pittsburgh, this rivalry may have just started.

ROOKIE DIVA 2005 COMPETITION

After all the votes were tallied, Joy Giovanni was selected as SmackDown!'s top Rookie Diva.

Joy earned 65 percent of the vote, while Michelle earned 18, Rochelle got 11 and Lauren earned 8 percent, respectively.

Joy outshined the others in an Evening Gown, Talent and Swimsuit competitions, although Michelle made a spalsh in her talent competition by slamming veteran Diva and competition co-host Dawn Marie.

CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP ELIMINATION MATCH

It looked as if Paul London was about to put the finishing touches on a heroic performance at No Way Out.

But Chavo Guerrero got his hands on the ropes and London was left wondering what could have been. Guerrero became the new Cruiserweight Champion by winning a six-man Elimination Match.

Until the final moments, London was the story. He defeated former champion Funaki, then pinned Spike Dudley with the help of a Funaki kick. Next was Shannon Moore, who was finished after a 450 splash.

London and Akio would have an exhausting battle that ended with Akio being countout. London himself barely made it to his feet.

Meanwhile, a fresh Guerrero was watching all of this unfold, patiently waiting his turn to pounce. Still, London found enough energy to get Chavo on his back, only to have Guerrero reverse a roll-up, use the ropes for leverage, gain the pin and the championship.

REY MYSTERIO & EDDIE GUERRERO def. THE BASHAMS

On paper, Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio seemed like a dream team.

And in the ring, that's exactly how it played out.

Guerrero and Mysterio, two of the greatest Latino Superstars of all-time, defeated the Bashams for the WWE Tag Team Championship at No Way Out.

Eddie and Rey ultimately outsmarted the Bashams. With the referee focused on taking one of championships out of the ring, Eddie got his hands on the other and wallopped Doug Basham while Rey gave Danny a 619 before he could break up the pin.

It was an especially sweet win for Mysterio, who along with former partner Rob Van Dam, lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to the Bashams on SmackDown! With RVD injured, Guerrero proved to be a brilliant replacement.

 NO. 1 CONTENDER'S TOURNAMENT FINAL: JOHN CENA def. KURT ANGLE

John Cena punched his ticket for WrestleMania 21 in dramatic fashion.

In arguably the greatest win of his career, Cena fought off an injured ankle to defeat four-time WWE Champion Kurt Angle in his hometown of Pittsburgh at No Way Out in the final of the No. 1 Contender's Tournament.

Angle had the upper hand for much of the match, working Cena over with some strong mat wrestling. Cena rallied, but Angle once again went after Cena's ankle, as Cena could barley stand on two feet.

But late in the match, with refereee Charles Robinson briefly down, Angle went to a corner and grabbed Cena's steel chain. Angle wrapped the chain around his fist as he prepared to put the finishing touches on Cena.

But just as Angle turned around, Cena somehow found the energy to lift himself off the mat and stunned Angle with a shoulder block to the midsection. Moments later, Cena connected with the FU to secure the emotional win.

Cena now automatically gets a chance to wrestle the WWE Champion, and possibly Batista, at WrestleMania 21.

UNDERTAKER def. LUTHER REIGNS

Luther Reigns might not have been scared of Undertaker, but he still wasn't able to defeat him.

After Mark Jindrak and Luther Reigns cost Undertaker a chance of advancing the No. 1 Contender's Tournament earlier this month, the Deadman wanted revenge.

And Undertaker would get it at No Way Out in a physical and grueling match. Reigns was able to connect on one swinging neckbreaker,but before he could apply another, the Deadman reversed the finisher with a DDT.

Moments later, it was Tombstone city and Reigns was down for the count.

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP: JBL def. BIG SHOW

JBL escaped one painful problem, but may have crawled right into another.

JBL retained his WWE Championship in a bloody Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match against Big Show at No Way Out in unusual fashion.

Big Show chokeslammed JBL off the top rope and the force actually collapsed the ring canvas as JBL basically plummeted to the floor.

Show then managed to break the steel chain that was locking the door to the cage and marched right through, raising his hands in apparent victory.

But what Big Show couldn't see was that the resilient JBL had escaped through the bottom of the ring and crawled out moments before Show had left via the more conventional door.

Show, shocked that he wasn't leaving Pittsburgh with the championship, went after a battered JBL before the Cabinet stormed the ring to save their boss.

Suddenly, the men had more company as RAW's Batista arrived and destroyed the Cabinet. Next, John Cena, who had previously earned his spot in the WrestleMania main event by defeating Kurt Angle, came out and attacked JBL.

Cena actually hit JBL with a spinbuster off a scaffolding near the ramp area. The night ended with Cena and Batista staring at each other from across the arena.

The most overrated Main Event EVER!  If you like my card better then the WWE's select that it was helpful if not put not helpful.",1111017600,,6104,4.869186046511628
1847123,4,B00008HCA1,"It's a great thing I saw this for free! Like the title says, the Divas really destroyed this from being a solid PPV! Let's begin...

Match #1 Eddie Guererro & Rey Mysterio vs. The Bashams for the WWE Tag Team Championships: CRAP! Eddie and rey were suppose to lose resulting in a heel turn for Eddie, leading to him and Rey at WM21. It's 20 days until WM21 and I don't know how they plan on building this match up at all. Anyways Eddie and Rey beat the horrible Bashams and win the tag titles. Decent opener. 7/10

I'm not gonna get into the Diva segments at all because they were a waste of time. They could have gotten rid of these and atleast had one more match in there, like Cena working two matches and the other involving the US title.

Match #2 Booker T vs. Heidenreich: UGGH, poor Booker T...one of my favorite wrestlers ever, and he is getting such a raw deal here, it's disgusting. Book wons by DQ after a chairshot to the throat. I'm so glad Book got his revenge twice on Smackdown! and maybe they'll give him a good feud now, because even Book couldn't make Heidenreich look good...5/10

Match #3 6 Man Guantlet for the Cruiserweight Title: A majority of the fans suck because they never give the cruiserweight s the respect they deserve. their matches are ruined by Divas and they get little to no recognition. paul London started this match and went the whole way only to get cheated by Chavo. Funaki walked in the champ and was the first to be eliminated, WOW! Chavo becomes new champ and we get to see Chavo vs. Paul London at WM21. I see this opening the show and it will be awesome! 10/10 even though this match was short!

Match #4 Taker v.s Luther Reigns: Taker made reigns look good in a match that I was sure would stink the joint up, but was better than I expected. Taker wins, obviously. 6/10

Match #5 Kurt Angle vs. John Cena for the #1 Contenders Slot a WM21: Match of the night by far! This was a war. I thought Kurt broke Cena's neck when he german suplexed him into the turnbuckle, CRAZY!!! I thought HBK would interfere here, but I'm glad he didn't cuz it would have made Cena look weak. Cena wins clean with the FU and is going to WM21!!! 10/10!

Match #6 Big Show vs. JBL (c) in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match for the WWE Title: Kind of slow at times, but a great match! With the ""lack"" of outside interference (yes there was still some), it made the match good, and JBL won CLEAN! Big Show chokeslams JBL through the ring, Big Show rips the chain off the door and as he is about to win JBL's music starts to play...JBL crawled out through the bottom of the ring!!! AWESOME! The Cabinet comes down to attack Show, but then Batista comes in and cleans house of the Cabinet! Then Cena spinebusts JBL through some stage and he and Batista have one of the longest stare downs ever to end the show. 9/10!

Besides the diva crap, this was a decent PPV. It was better then No Way Out 2004. The only other bad thing about this was the the barbed wire never came into play during the whole match. At least find a reason to watch this, but don't buy it if you can avoid it.",1110758400,2,3097,4.255102040816326

WWE Tag Team Title Match

The Basham Brothers (c)s vs. Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero

Its hard to beleive that at the 2004 edition Eddie Guerrero def.

Brock Lesnar to become WWE Champion.  Great opener with some good spots I also love the finish where once again Eddie cheats to win.  At least Eddie and Rey got some gold.  6.5/10

Booker T vs. Heidenreich

turnwd out better than I thought with Heidenreich getting disqualified after hitting Boker with a chair.  2.5/10

Six man Elimination match for WWE Cruiserweight Title

Funaki (c) vs. Spike vs. Akio vs. Chavo vs. Paul London vs. shannon Moore

Good action but I still remember wcw and how great their cruiserweights were.  London defs. Funaki, Spike, Moore, and Akio

before getting rolled up by a rope grabbing Chavo who wins the match and wins the title.  5/10

The Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns

Good match and effort from both men.  'Taker pins Luther with a tombstone to win the match.  5/5

#1 Contender for WWE Title at Wrestlemania 21 Tour. Final

Kurt Angle vs. John Cena

Best match of the night with Cena getting his win back from No Mercy 2003.  Cena wins with a F-U.  7.5/10

Barbed Wire Steel Cage WWE Championship Match

JBL (c) vs. The Big Show

A real good solid 15 minute match from these two.  The finish has got to be the best Cage Match Finish ever.  Big Show chokeslams JBL through the ring.  As Show rips through the chained up door JBL climbs out from under the ring and wins the match.  Afterwards JBL's cabinet attack Show and Batista runs out and destroys them while Cena spinebusters JBL off onto a platform by the entrance way to end the show",1109462400,2,1963,4.480113636363637

Three of the matches were good, two were ok, and one was just terrible (the diva contest isn't even worth any true critique).

Bashams vs. Eddie/Rey- One of the three good matches, solid tag-team action.

Booker T vs. Heidenreich- Horrible match, worst of the night.  John needs to go back to OVW asap.

Cruiserweight Elimination- Could have been so much better if 1. WWE let the cruisers go all out and 2. If London had won.

Undertaker vs. Reigns- Decent big-man brawl.  Only truely enjoyable if you are a big fan of Taker's.

Angle vs. Cena: #1 Contender's Tournament Final- MOTN.  A great effort by both guys made this match great and probably the best match I have seen from either one in a long time.

JBL vs. Big Show: Barbed Wire Steel Cage- Second best match of the night.  Didn't live up to the hype, but the ending alone made it a match to remember.",1109030400,,1031,4.368421052631579
1847128,2,B00008HCA1,"Another dissapointing smackdown ppv. Here's how i rate the matches of last night's ppv:

Rookie Diva 2005 Competition: 1/10

This was really a waste of time. This took up so much time that a great match could have been added instead of it. Pointless.

Booker T vs. Heidenreich: 3/10

This was really like a boring smackdown match. This match was clearly just thrown in to pass the time. The worst match of the ppv.

WWE Tag Team Championship Match: 5/10

An average match. Nothing special from any of the wrestlers, i've seen them all perform much better matches on smackdown. Slow-paced and bad as far as tag team matches go.

Cruiserweight Championship Elimination Match: 6/10

I expected alot more from this. With cruiserweights i expected a fast-paced, high-flying match but this match was a dissapointment. One or two good spots but overall a dissapointment. Each wrestler was eliminated way too fast.

Kurt Angle vs. John Cena: 7/10

Probably the best match of the night and it was nothing special. It just didn't feel like a ppv match, i personally don't think that both men gave it their all. Had a few good spots but once again i expected more from a ppv.

Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns: 5/10

Once again a horribly average match. Nothing great about it at all. Just felt like watching a smackdown mid-card match. Another match just thrown in to pass the time of this terrible ppv.

Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match - 6.5/10

Don't get your hopes up, the barbed wire is NOT used and the cage is barely used at all. If you take out the barbed wire this was still a lousy cage match. Two big guys, a slow match, most of the moves were just chops and punches. The JBL spot through the ring did suprise me but that was the only exciting part of the match.

Overall, a very dissapointing ppv. There is NOTHING special about this event.

Save your money, don't bother watching this, i'm sorry i did.",1108944000,,1897,4.584569732937686
1847129,4,B00008HCA1,"No Way Out 2005 will be remembered for the incredible one on one match between two of Smackdown's best superstars, Kurt Angle and John Cena. However don't think that was all that happened, there were two other matches worth watching, including the main event....

Heidenreich vs. Booker T

Seems like Heidenreich is still with the WWE. After his horrible feud with the Undertaker it is back to square one. The match was typical big man style.

Booker is great but Heidenreich tended to stick to weird facial expressions and bad wrestling. Heidenreich slams a chair into Booker's neck and gets disqualified. 7/10

WWE Tag Team Championships
Basham Brothers [champions] vs. Eddie Guerreroe and Rey Mysterio

A good tag team match, Eddie and Rey work well as a team. The Basham Brothers are improving, but definately not that good compared to other teams of the past. Lots of high flying by Mysterio. Eddie and Rey win after Eddie hits Doug, or Danny I'm not sure, with the tag belt. Good match. 8/10

Rookie Diva Competition

Ughh, so much valuable time is wasted with these girls. If they invested their money on women who can actually wrestle, maybe more people would watch, my opinion. Joy wins with practically 70% of the votes from the people at home. No score

Crusierweight Championship
Funaki [Champion] vs. Paul London vs. Chavo Guerreroe vs. Spike Dudley vs. Akio vs. Shannon Moore

Great high flying match. Maybe the WWE is finally wising up and giving the crusierweight divsion more attention. Paul London shined in that match, he literally faced all five other competitors.

His match with Akio is the best, both men took some great flying moves. And he even gave a neckbreaker to Akio off the top rope, great match. 9/10 Chavo wins after pinning london.

Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns

Now this is typical big men type match. Lots of power moves and huge spinebusters and tackling in this one. Reigns was just another small victim for the Undertaker leading into WM 21. Okay match and the Undertaker wins with a tombstone. 7.5/10

Finals of the #1 contenders tournament
Kurt Angle [in his hometown] vs. John Cena

Like their other two one on one matches together, this is definately great to watch. Both men really wrestle each other.

With Kurt giving three German Suplexes to Cena, and Cena with his ""street fighting"" and levelling Angle's head on the announce table over and over, great stuff.

Angle locks on the Ankle lock at least four times. I was expecting HBK to show up but he didn't. They are probably saving that for the show when Batista makes his contract signing. Great match. 9.5/10 Cena wins with the FU.

Barb Wire Steel Cage Match
WWE Championship
JBL [champion] vs. The Big Show

Very short, but very bloody. Big Show gets busted open almost immediately, JBL bleeds not long after that. As for the barb wire, not even used once. JBL did managed to get some wire cutters and tired to cut through, but Big Show stopped him.

Best moment of the match was when Big Show chokeslams JBL off the top rope and JBL goes right through the mat! Big Show walks out of the cage and thinks he has won, but JBL crawled out under the ring through the hole and retains his championshio. 8.5/10, just for the blood and the great chokeslam.

After the match Batista comes and destroys Jbl's cabinet members, then Cena comes out and takes out JBL.

This was definately a good ppv, maybe not worth 35 bucks, but well worth the 20 bucks when it comes out on DVD.",1108857600,6,3471,4.685337726523888

Funaki vs. Spike Dudley for the Cruiserweight Championship.  This match will be made because Spike has a rematch in his contract.  The match is boring and Funaki retains after he hits the Rising Sun at 6:11.

JBL vs. Undertaker for the WWE Championship.  This match was made because the match at the Rumble between Taker and Heidenreich became a #1 contender's match.  The match ends when Heidenriech comes and hits Taker with the belt then JBL hits a Clothesline From Hell at 14:44.

Lance Storm & William Regal vs. RVD & Kane for the World Tag Titles.  This match was very good but I believe that Kane could see that RVD was there and then chokeslammed him.  Regal & Storm win because Kane is a loser. (7/10)

Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit was supposed to have Edge on Lesnar & Benoit's team but I still like that it was a Handicap Match.  Benoit & Lesnar just kill those 3 losers. (8/10)

Triple H vs. Scott Steiner for the World Title.  There match at the Rumble was at least worth watching but this was just horrible.  Steiner can't wrestle & HHH retains in a huge disappointment. (4.5/10)

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Eric Bischoff was the return of Stone Cold.  Bischoff just got his a$$ kicked by Austin.  This match was hilarious.  Of course Stone Cold wins. (7/10)

The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan was a total screw job but it was pretty interseting.  Vince just screws HulkaMania once again when he had the ref in on the match.  The ref is a member of La Resistance currently.  The Rock steals one from Hogan. (6/10)

This DVD can't get 2003 out of the bottom.  This is only worth seeing for the Handicap Match that is not all that good.  BYE!!",1102464000,,1866,4.443786982248521

  This was a great match.  Kane starts to turn heel in this match.  Regal & Storm retain the gold in a great match. 9/10

  This was a fun match to watch.  Why did you have to give Hardy the Cruiserweight Title.  Kidman could beat him anyday. 5/10

Undertaker v. Big Show

Team Angle v. Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit  3 on 2 Handicap

  This was a very good match that showcases Lesnar & Benoit's abilities.  Edge was gonna be on Lesnar and Benoit's team but he broke his neck.  Brock and Benoit still pick up the victory. 7/10

  This was a boring and slow match.  Scott Steiner wishes every night he could wrestle.  HHH makes him look worse then he already does.  HHH retains the gold in fashion. 3/10

Stone Cold Steve Austin v. Eric Bischoff

  This was a very dominated match by Stone Cold.  Bischoff kicked him once and Austin just beat Bischoff like a mule after that.  Austin is back with a purpose. 7/10

1847160,4,B00008HCA1,"Although ""No Way Out"" 2003 did not have the best matches as far as quality goes, it marked the return of some of the biggest stars and featured some surprises.

1. Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy

Good way to kick off the show.  Probably the best match of the night.  It is one of Jeff's better straight up wrestling matches.  Interestingly, this was supposed to be Test/Jericho, but Test and Stacy were penalized for missing a flight a couple of weeks earlier.  Good match with a lot of near falls.  Christian makes an appearance.  Good post match action.  Shawn Michaels makes an appearance.  Surprise, considering it is in Montreal.  (8.5/10)

2. Lance Storm & William Regal vs. Rob Van Dam & Kane (World Tag Titles)

Okay match.  Nothing too exciting.  It started the long downfall of Kane as a face and began to show a start of a fued with RVD.  (7/10)

3. Billy Kidman vs. Matt Hardy (Cruiserweight Title)

Good match, although nothing too exciting.  It was about what would be expected from these two.  Matt should not have been a cruiserweight.  (7.5/10)

4. Undertaker vs. Big Show

Very slow and boring match except for the sick Suicide Dive by Taker over the top rope.  A-Train and the F.B.I. make appearances in this match.  (6.5/10)

5. Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, & Charlie Haas vs. Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit (Handicap Match)

This was supposed to bea six man tag match, but Edge injured his neck about a week before.  Good match, although I did not think it was as good as everyone thought.  It was a bit disappointing to me.  (7.5/10)

6. Triple H vs. Scott Steiner (World Heavyweight Title)

Steiner was given another chance after the Rumble disaster and he ruined it.  It wasn't as bad as the Rumble match, but not good by any means.  Steiner just doesn't have it anymore.  The crowd was bored and cheered for the match being over.  Triple H did his best to carry Steiner.  (6/10)

7. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Eric Bischoff

This match marked the return for Austin after being out the business for 8 months.  It was awesome to see him back.  The crowd went crazy for the match.  Austin is pretty funny in the match.  (8/10)

8. Hulk Hogan vs. The Rock

This was the overhyped rematch from Wrestlemania 18.  Not the best match, but a great Montreal finish.  No one can do it like Vince.  (7.5/10)

This is not the best PPV, but it is decent.  It is not essential to add to your collection, but it couldn't hurt.  The DVD extras feature Austin's surprise appearance after RAW went off the air a couple of weeks earlier.

1847161,3,B00008HCA1,"Match1: Jeff Hardy Vs. Jericho.
Outcome: Jericho wins by submision.
1 to 10: 8. Good match considering that this was the last PPV apperence that Jeff Hardy ever made untill his ROH and TNA apperences.
Match2: RVD and Kane(c) Vs. Un Americans for world tag titles.
Outcome: Lance Storm pinned RVD to win the titles.
1 to 10: 6. The match had a shocking ending wich fetured Kane chokeslamming RVD. After the match, questions raced through my mind weather or not Kane had intentionaly chokeslamed RVD or not.
match3: Matt Hardy Vs. Billy Kidman(c) for Criuserwieght title.
outcome: Matt Hardy pinned Billy Kidman after TOF to win title.
1 to 10: 7.5 I didn't like the match itself, but I liked the aftermatch confrontation including Jeff and Matt. Jeff got pissed after Matt was talkin about how his fate would be had he got out of his Imag-I-Nation phase, maybe he wouldn't be such a loser. Jeff kicked his ass.
Skip the next two matches.
Match6: HHH(c) Vs. Scott Stiener.
outcome: HHH retains title due to interferance by Evolution.
1 to 10: 3.5. The reason i gave it a 3.5 rating is because of the blood,and Triple H retaining the title.
Match7: Eric Bitchoff Vs. Stoned Coned Steve Asshead.
outcome: Asshead pinned Bitchoff after 3 snow cone stunners.
1 to 10: 5.5. Overall an ok match. I just wish I would stop making fun of everyone.
Match8: The Rock Vs. Hulk Hogan
Outcome: The Rock pinned Hulk Hogan after Vince pulled the Montreal Screw Job AGAIN!!!
1 to 10: I didn't really like this match but I'll give it a 5.1. Only because I don't like The Rock(he made a mockery out of Jeff Hardy and made him quit!) Vince McMahon(he is another person that had to do with Jeff Hardy retiring because he told the medics to not give him medical attention.) And I don't like Sylvester Greenhair(or Slvain Grenier) (WELL DON'T WE ALL LOVE TO HATE THIS FRENCH POPCORN FART?!?!)

Just not world championship match quality. Scott Steiner would be a worthy champion, and he would have won if Batista, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton didn't interfere, but I don't think the wwe wants him as champion.
7. Eric Bishoff vs. Stone cold Steve Austin 6/10
Obviously Eric Bischoff got his ass kicked with the no interference stipulation, but I rather watch the Steiner-HHH match which wasn't very good.

Good match, not the best match of the night, but a good one.
Hogan gets screwed which makes me happy. I like the heel Rock more than the face one anyway.

Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy (Last PPV before he was fired) 7.5 since the match was pretty entertaining, except it wasn't high quality.

Cruserweight Championship match: Billy Kidman (Champion) vs. Matt Hardy (w/Shannon Moore) 8 since the match was pretty good, plus there were a lot of high flying moves.

1847168,4,B00008HCA1,"No Way Out is usually a decent event as it leads up to Wrestlemania and serves as a hype center. This year was no exception.
Jeff Hardy vs. Chris Jericho-This would prove to be Jeff Hardy's last match in the WWE for quite a while and man was it exciting. Jericho shows how good he is by feuding with practically the entire RAW roster. He goes back to his high flying cruiserweight WCW days and doesn't look back. Jeff Hardy manages to put on his best match in recent memory. A good opener and a solid match. 8 out of 10 stars.
William Regan and Lance Storm vs Rob Van Dam and Kane for the World Tag Team Championship-Lance Storm and even  RVD to some extent are two of the best athletes that the WWE has. But even they cannot save this match. William Regal does absolutely nothing for me. The last match I can remember him having was against Austin and that was just him getting beaten down. Crap match with a crap ending. 6 out of 10 stars.
Matt Hardy v. 1 w/Shannon Moore vs Billy Kidman for the Cruiserweight Championship- The Crusiwerweight Championship is only on PPV when it changes hands. The last time was Survivor Series when it changed hands from Jamie Knoble to Billy Kidman and now it's Billy Kidman passing it on. Good to see Matt Hardy getting a push and good to see him holding a title that's not with a partner. Decent match. 7 out of 10.
The Undertaker vs The Big Show w/Paul Heyman-The Undertaker finally gets his hands on The Big Show after Show put Taker on the shelf for three months. An entertaing match and a match that shows that the Undertaker can still go. The leap over the rope on to The Big Show and A-Train gets the adrenaline pumpping everytime and reminds us that we are still watching a legend at work. 9 out of 10.
Brock Lesnar and Chris Benoit vs Team Angle(Kurt Angle, Charlie Haas, and Shelton Benjamin)-This was originally supposed to be a six man tag match, but Edge was taken out backstage and Lesnar and Benoit decided that they would make this a handicap match. It would have made sense for Team Angle to win, but since Lesnar and Benoit decided to go it alone it must be a portent that they would win. A solid, techinical wrestling match that was really only hampered by it's outcome. How many times is Lesnar going to get the better of Kurt Angle before Wrestlemania? 7 out of 10 stars.
Scott Steiner vs HHH w/Evolution(Batista, Orton, and Flair) for the World Heavyweight Championship-People feel the need to criticize the Steiner/HHH matches and while they might be justified some of it it unwarranted. Sure neither of them are good matches, but people nit pick at every little detail to make them seem worse. This match is better than the Royal Rumble match, but with that said this isn't Bret Hart and HBK. Nothing spectacular, but nothing totally horrible. 6out of 10.
Eric Bischoff vs Stone Cold Steve Austin-This match marks Austin's return to the WWE since his walk out the previous summer and what better way to return than against his former boss. The match itself is awesome just for it's entertainment aspect. Austin does not appear to have lost anything and play to the crowd like the Austin of old. Bischoff had no chance of winning like anyone even cares, yet he manages to ""kick out"" of a couple pinning situations. Like I said this match rules for the entertainment values(i.e. watching Bischoff get massacred). 9 out of 10.
The Rock vs Hulk Hogan-Part 2:Hollywood vs Hollywood-This also marks the Rock's return and somewhere between here and last year's Summerslam The Rock decided that the fans had turned against him. He returns sporing a new bald head and an even more impressive new tattoo. The match itself was nowhere near as good as their Wrestlemania X8 match, but it was still good. Sets up Vince and Hogan at Wrestlemania and to a small extent Austin and The Rock. 7 out of 10 stars.
The DVD itself contains some cool extras including Austin's return to RAW that took place the night Vince made the Bischoff/Austin match and the confrontation between Hogan and The Rock on Smackdown. A good ppv with some exciting matches.",1066089600,3,4094,4.5625
1847169,3,B00008HCA1,"This edition of No Way Out wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Let me start from the beginning of the card:
Jeff Hardy Vs. Chris Jericho - A surprisingly good match considering that Y2J has gotten the better of Hardy in the past. Good exchanges and cadence to the match. Jericho was decidedly cheered though he was a heel (this PPV was in Canada and Jericho is Canadian) but the crowd also gave Hardy his due as well.
RVD/Kane Vs. Lance Storm/William Regal - WWE ""RAW"" World Tag Team Championship
This match was pretty much one sided until Storm pulled off an illegal but smart move on Kane. I won't give away what it was but it was ""simple but effective."" Great exchange between RVD and Storm which was a throwback to their matches in the old ECW.
Billy Kidman Vs. Matt Hardy w/Shannon Moore - WWE Cruiserweight Championship
As typical, the cruiserweights put on a good show. Not great but it definitely didn't suck. The ending of this match has to be one of the more ""face cringers"" I've personally have ever seen (Face Cringers means moves that make you go AHHHHH!)
Chris Benoit & Brock Lesner Vs. Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Sheldon Benjamin, Charlie Haas)
With the combined experience and pure wrestling talent of Angle, Benjamin and Haas, you'd think it would be impossible for even THREE men to beat them much less two but if any two men could beat them it is Benoit and Lesner! This match wasn't too flashy but a lot of holds and counter holds and awesome suplexes and slams!
Undertaker Vs. The Big Show
Slow, boring match but it DID reveal a new style to the 'Taker as he displayed more submission type holds during this match.
Scott Steiner Vs. Triple H - ""RAW"" World Heavyweight Championship
While it is an improvement from their Royal Rumble encounter, it still sucks! Steiner isn't the Scott Steiner from 10 years ago when he combined power and agility. He isn't even the Steiner from WCW just a 2 short years ago when he went to brute power and intensity. HHH, on the other hand, isn't the same man that once gave consistently good matches with The Rock, Steve Austin or Mick Foley. He hasn't been the same since his quad injury (though I give him props for having the guts to come back at all from that injury).
Anyway, it isn't that great.
Stone Cold Steve Austin VS. Eric Bischoff
CAN YOU SAY TOTAL ELIMINATION!? Bischoff wasn't even close to beating Austin! Even Vince McMahon did better than Uncle Eric! In a nutshell, Austin slaghters Eric Bischoff!
The Rock VS.Hulk Hogan
Nowhere near the classic that their WrestleMania 18 encounter was though The Rock in full heel persona DID make it watchable! To quote Vinnie Mac, ""THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL"" and there certainly was no chance in hell of Hogan winning that night! This was a great set up for Vince Vs. Hogan at WrestleMania 19 the following month.

Chris Jericho def. Jeff Hardy This was a good match with a lot of action by both men but the one on RAW was a little better
6/10 stars
World Tag Team Champions Regal & Storm def. Kane & RVD This was also a good match but the ending was a little messy, but it was
still a good tag team match 7.5/10 stars
Cruiserweight Championship: Matt Hardy def. (c) Billy Kidman This match wasn't exactly all high fliying like it was suppose to be and the ending was offul 5/10 stars
Undertaker def. Big Show via submission This was a little boring from the super slow paced action by the Big Show but Undertaker put on a good fight but it was stupid whe he tried to chokeslam Big Show twice! 6/10 stars
Chris Beniot & Brock Lesnar def. Team Angle This was an awesome match! All 5 men put on a great fight! 10/10 stars
World Heavyweight Champion Triple H def. Scott Stiener This was a great match with a super terrible ending but despite the interfearence by Evolution it was a great match 8/10 stars
Stone Cold Steve Austin def. Eric Bischoff This was a hilarious match but Austin made it a little short but I loved the ending! 9.5/10 stars
The Rock def. Hulk Hogan Booooooooo! Mr. Mcmahon and the referee Sylvain Granie wrecked the match. The ending was trash but the rest of the match was pretty good. I'll only give this match 6.5/10 stars
This ppv over all rating is 58.5/80 stars This is a must see ppv. If you are a great wrestling fan, you'll want to get this",1063065600,7,2025,4.357142857142857

Good opener, i really enjoyed this one, both superstars performed well throughout,with good offence from both, the crowd were good also. 7.5/10
RAW Tag Team Titles
-RVD/Kane vs Storm/Regal
This was O.K, but i have seen better from these guys. The crowd were into it again, the best performance coming from RVD. 6.5/10
Cruiserweight Title
-Kidman vs Matt Hardy
The match was quite gd, but the cruiserweight division is exteremley interesting and exciting, but these two guys didn't show it. Mattitude is boring, the Hardyz toghether were better, no more TLC! NO! What will happen when Lita returns? ... 6/10
-Taker vs Show
Two big guys figthing it out, they always seem to wrestle well against each other, however this wasn't good! Crowd were vey quiet, the ending was poor! A-Train was involoved, ... 5.5/10
-Team Angle vs Lesnar/Benoit
Originally Edge should have been involved, but he gets attacked! The match was good, but i would have liked to have seen the title on the line instead or the tag titles. I don't like Lesnar as a face, he is better as a heel! Angle is the best wrestler in WWE, ... However, he doesn't show he is any good in this. 7/10
World Heavyweight Championship
-HHH vs Steiner
The crowd were behind the game all the way through. The match at Royal Rumble was boring, but this was a better beginning, middle and end, however way too short. 7/10
-Bischoff vs Austin
Finally Austin returns, and better than ever. Crowd, as well as me enjoyed this, of course it was all AUSTIN! Several stunners to Bischoff, ..., you'll like this. 7.5/10
-ROCK vs HOGAN II
This was way too short, but in the time it had, it was good, but not as good as wrestlemania X8. The ending i really enjoyed, i love the ROCK as a heel, he is so funny, HOGAN of course was good, and i enjoyed this. 8/10
Looking back at this event, it was good, though i have seen better! It is worth seeing! The ROCK/HOGAN match was the best, and made this event good. All in all i give it a 7.5/10",1062892800,,1998,4.506887052341598

Y2J VS. JEFF HARDY
(A very solid opener but Jeff can't break his loosing streak and falls short once again)
Big Show vs. Undertaker
(Like watching paint dry!. Very sleep inducing stuff with Taker winning the match after making Show submit to the triangular hold)
(World tag team championship)
Kane & RVD vs. Lance Storm & William Regal
(A good match with Kane & RVD really taking it to the champs but Kane messes things up again)
(WWE Cruiserweight championship)
Jamie Noble vs. Billy Kidman
(Yet again the cruiserweights amaze us with bewildering high-flying manouvers. Kidman finally takes Noble's title away)
Eric Bischoff vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
(The rattlesnake returns to the ring!. Austin looks in fine shape and slaughters the raw general manager. Finishing him off with three stone cold stunners!)
3 on 2 handi-cap match
TEAM ANGLE vs. Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit
(Despite Edge being taken out before the match. Benoit & Lesnar still hold their own and amazingly pull off the upset)
World Heavyweight championship
Triple H vs. Scott Steiner
(An absolutely abysmal match that doesn't pick up at all)
Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. The Rock
(This was nothing more than a screw job from start to finish.
Believe me this is not a re-match from wrestlemania x8.
Vince,The Rock and the referee all screw Hogan)
Extras - For a dreadful ppv this dvd has some really meaty extras including lots of interviews and Stone Cold's return to Raw just after Raw went off the air)
Overall - The ppv never really picks up and I can safely say failed to live up to the expectations but if you buy the dvd simply for the Hogan/Rock re-match think again as it was an awful match. The dvd extras do save the dvd though I wouldn't recommend buying this.",1057104000,4,1867,4.677811550151976
1847177,5,B00008HCA1,"Of the 3 big head line matches, I liked 2 of them. The one I was a little disappointed with was the rematch of hogan vs. rock because of what Vince McMahon did to Hogan. But the Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Eric Bishoff match was great and extremely funny! I laughed so hard at what Stone Cold did to Bishoff that I fell off the couch! It was great! Big Poppa Pump did an excellent job of holding his own against the World Champ Triple H. Unfortunately, something happened that gave Triple H the advantage to retain the title. But also the Undertaker vs. The big Show, WOW! Talk about two of the biggest power houses in the business other than Brock Lesnar. And while we are talking about Brock Lesnar I must mention the AWESOME two on three handicapped match Brock Lesnar and Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle and his two side kicks collectively known as ""Team Angle"" Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin. Wow! This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of the

What can I say the openning match [was great],
Chris Jericho vs Jeff hardy. Lots of high flying maneuvers and an a good ending to it.
Well, The most unique team of the RAW roster lost again
Kane & RVD vs William Regal & Lance Storm.(world tag titles)
Good match, with RVD performing some high flying action.
Kane always messing things up.
Matt Hardy vs Billy Kidman.(cruiserweigth champioship)
Matt work [very hard]  to enter the cruiserwegth division and he did it. After all that work, finally paid off as he became the new Cruiserweigth champion.
Undertaker vs Big Show.
A match where two mammoths collided. Once teacher and student , Taker took Big Show to school. Great Win for Big Evil.
Great six man tag match.
Team Angle & Kurt Angle vs Lesnar, Benoit & Edge.
Too bad Edge got injured befor the match. Still it was one of the greates match of this pay-per-view.
A boring match between Triple H and Scott Steiner.(world heavyweigth championship)
No chemistry in the match at all.
Stone Cold's return was the best part of this pay-per-view.
Eric Bishoff got [beaten]by the Texas Rattle Snake.
The Rock vs Hogan.
a better match than the one they had at wrestlemania 18, with a very interesting ending to it. Finally the Rock turn heel(bad guy) after 4 years.
The DVD extras are awesome. Specially Stone Cold's Return to RAW after RAW went of the air!

  Stone Cold Steve Austin VS. Eric Bischoff (10/10)
  Everyone who watched Eric Bischoff kicked J.R.'s ass the previous Monday, will be happy to see the rattlesnake kick the crap out of Eric Bischoff.  A Texas-sized ass whumping as J.R. tells us at the end of the match.
  The Rock VS.Hulk Hogan  (1.5/10)
 This is no rematch from last year's WrestleMania.  This was sooo against Hulk Hogan it wasn't funny.  First, the lights went out and the Refferre is down.  Vince McMahon comes to ringside to distract Hogan. Meanwhile, the Refferree pushes the steel chair to The Rock and the rock wins with the help with the chair.

This match was no classic, however, Eric does get the living daylights beaten out of him, and even recieves four stunners! The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan 2 turned out to be a much better bout than the one they had at Wrestlemania 18 last year. Keep your eyes peeled on The Rock, as he finally turns heel (bad guy) for the first time in four years. Triple H vs. Scott Steiner was a dud. Triple H has become such a boring wrestler. He used to could have a good match with anybody, but as of late ""The Game"" has gone down hill big time, and this dull match proves just that.
Get this video if you're a true WWE fan. It's worth adding to your collection. It's got some pretty good matches, and it's got some pretty lame ones, too, but it's still a good PPV.",1050537600,,858,4.1437125748503

1. Stone Cold vs. Eric Bischoff
*****
-This match isn't about style or scientific wrestling, just a great nostalgic return of a true legend.
2. Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy
****1/2
-It's just so ironic that this match is the opener and steals the show. This match had every other match beat as far as the ""wrestling"" goes.
3. World Heavyweight Championship:
Triple H(c) w/ Ric Flair vs. Scott Steiner
****
-Way better than Rock/Hogan II, a vastly improved match compared to their ""oh so bad"" match at Royal Rumble. Lots of run-ins on Triple H's part and just an all out street fight.
4. Part II:
The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan
***1/2
-On paper this match looks like a spectacular sequel to their Wrestlemania battle. Unfortunately, there were a few things missing since last year's match. This match came right after Austin's return, so the crowd was not as lively, also, this was not in front of 65,000 plus like Wrestlemania X8. Its not saying this match was bad, but just a letdown.

7984105,4,B00008HCA1,"NO WAY OUT 2005 REVIEW
 Ill admit it; Im a sucker for any WWE DVD. So when I came across this one for a bargain, I picked it up. Im a fairly new fan, so I had never seen nor heard of any of these matches. Based on the reviews, I didn't expect much. In fact I almost anticipated a letdown, but I was pleasantly surprised with the final product. Here is my match-by-match review of No Way Out 2005.

Under *- Almost unwatchable
*- Poor
**- Mediocre
** - Average
***- Solid
***  - Very Good
****- Great
****  - Match of the Year quality
*****- Instant Classic

Match 1- Rey Mysterio & Eddie Guerrero VS the Basham Brothers
 Even though I haven't a clue who the Basham Brothers are, they seemed like a good match for Eddie and Rey. After about 10 minutes of Mysterio being pretty much dominated, Eddie found a way to swindle his team to a victory. Nothing special, but a solid opener, and it was nice to see Eddie Guerrero lying, cheating and stealing again. R.I.P Eddie.  RATING- ***

Match 2- Booker T VS Heidenreich
 This actually could have been another solid match, if it went a little longer. Some nice brawling until Heidenreich hits Booker T with a steel chair, ending the match by DQ after only 6 minutes.  UGH.  RATING- *

Match 3- Six Man Elimination Match for the Cruiserweight Title
 For a bout lasting a little fewer than ten minutes, this contest sure had a lot of action. From the instant it started, it didn't slow down until Chavo Guerrero won the championship. Plenty of high flying moments and some good spots; overall it was a good, solid match.  RATING- ***

Match 4- Undertaker VS Luther Reigns
 Sadly, Luther Reigns is NOT Roman Reigns long lost brother. Instead, hes some jobber that didn't deserve to be in the same ring as an all-time great like the Deadman. Taker carried the whole match, and it was apparent. After a decent 11 minutes, Undertaker tombstoned Luther and got the pinfall victory. I only recommend this bout to a big time Taker fan like me.  RATING- **

Match 5- John Cena VS Kurt Angle #1 Contender Match (Match of the Night)
 Back before Cena was unanimously hated, he was the fan-favorite, street fighting rapper that wasn't invincible. This bout showcases the skills of both talented superstars, Cena especially. Mix in some drama, a heaping dose of technical wrestling and a pinch of brawling and you have a recipe for a fantastic contest.  RATING- **** 

Match 6- Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match for the WWE Championship- JBL VS Big Show
 Wow. What a chaotic bloodbath. Both men get busted wide open early on, and then they proceed to maul each other for 15 minutes. A definite OMG moment towards the end, but I won't spoil it for you. All I can say is that JBL retains his belt in a in a way only he can.  RATING- ****

Overall, I would certainly recommend this to any fan of TV-14 WWE. A good, high quality PPV.",1447200000,,2854,4.4423076923076925

7984107,5,B00008HCA1,"Great ppv,fast shipping!!!",1416787200,,26,8.0
7984108,3,B00008HCA1,"While several pay-per-view later in the year could claim hat their main events delivered but were failed by lackluster undercard matches, No Way Out 2003 was the exact opposite; had the last three matches fell off the face of the Earth, this would be a very good show! It almost has a WCW like quality with the good undercard and bad main events... And, wouldn't you know, Hogan's in the top slot!

Nah, I'm not going to bag on the Hulkster here. Out of the three main events, his rematch with the Rock was by far the best. It's not even close to the WrestleMania X8 match--it's not even close to a good match--but it was fun nonsense with the Rock working over time. The other two, Austin/Bischoff and Triple H/Steiner, were both simply abysmal.

The undercard, on the other hand, is exceptional. Chris Jericho and Jeff Hardy had a great opener while other bouts like Big Show/Taker, Kidman/Hardy and the Tag Team Titles match were strong additions. The best match was a handicap tag team encounter with Brock Lesnar and Chris Benoit taking on Team Angle without the benefit of their third man, Edge. It's a great, nearly four star encounter between five guys that simply went out an wrestled to create drama and tension when nothing was really on the line.

No Way Out won't be remembered as a great card... Or be remembered much at all to be honest; however, it's a wonderful cross section of wrestling styles that just needed one good match at the end of the show to put it over the top.",1410220800,,1491,4.5353159851301115
7984109,3,B00008HCA1,"""No Way Out"" was the last stop before one of my favorite WrestleManias, and I thought it laid the groundwork nicely for the Smackdown half of the card while still being able to deliver compelling matches and moments. The big stories going into the match were that JBL was being put in yet another ""no win"" situation against the Big Show and the tournament to crown the next contender to the WWE Championship.

Not Worth Watching: There were a few bad matches on the card, but nothing was offensively bad past Heidenreich and Booker T. The Undertaker and Luther Reigns had a disappointing hoss match that exposed Reigns as still being too green for that big of a match.

Worth Watching: Eddie Guerrero and Mysterio made the opener quite memorable and had hints at their WrestleMania clash and eventual feud. The main event was a surprisingly good barbwire cage match with an awesome, memorable ending. I really enjoyed this one and maybe one of the few that liked JBL as champion.

Match of the Night: John Cena and Kurt Angle have clashed numerous times, but I contend that this is the best of that lot as they really put on a show. The crowd was really into the story during the match and John Cena got the unanimous reaction from fans you never see anymore.

While it's not great, this edition of ""No Way Out"" was a fun watch with a forgotten classic on the card. Worth looking into if you want to revisit the rise of WWE's current cash cow.",1409443200,,1443,4.517241379310345
7984110,4,B00008HCA1,"Again, for about 1/10th of what this cost to watch in 2008, you can add this classic WWE Pay Per View to your collection.

Featured matches included TWO Elimination Chamber Matches. The Main Event Match featured Triple H defeating Jeff Hardy, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Umaga, and JBL in match that guaranteed a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XXIV. The other Elimination Chamber Match had The Undertaker defeating Batista, Finlay, MVP, The Great Khali, and the late Big Daddy V in a match that guaranteed a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXIV

The Undercard had John Cena defeating WWE Champion Randy Orton disqualification, Edge retaining the World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio, Ric Flair defeated Mr. Kennedy in a match that had Flair's career on the line, and Chavo Guerrero defeated CM Punk and retained his ECW Championship.

Classic WWE that combines the best of the action with great storylines from back in the day when blood was a common thing. AND TWO ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCHES!
