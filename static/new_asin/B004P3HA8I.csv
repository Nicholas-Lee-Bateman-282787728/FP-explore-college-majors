4443820,5,B004P3HA8I,Arrived in timely fashion.  Waiting to watch after I get through watching other purchases. Great way to spend the holidays watching.,1356825600,,132,5.285714285714286
4443821,5,B004P3HA8I,"Excellent!  A futuristic pulp fiction.  As Blade Runner set a new high water mark, and so this TV show continues, sets a new pace, and a new very high standard of excellence!  Intense, edgy, suspenceful, intelligent, and more - all superlatives!

Wikipedia has a very good article on the series.",1356220800,,295,4.84
4443822,4,B004P3HA8I,I love Sci-Fi and this series was a good one.  I liked the characters and the storylines.  My only problem was that it didn't last longer than one season.,1356048000,,154,4.275862068965517
4443823,3,B004P3HA8I,"I purchased the Total Recall series because I liked the first movie (not the remake, which was not good), and I liked the Tekwars series, which came out about the same time. The Total Recall series was a lot of talking and not enough special effects. I'm not talking about the new type of special effects that are over down now a days,with green screen, but the old hand made computers,  flashing lights and backgrounds that made it look futuristic and cool. I know when I started watching it, it didn't hold my attention and I watch a lot of SCI-FI, both good and bad, and old and new.",1355443200,,586,4.376146788990826
4443824,3,B004P3HA8I,"This is a bit dated (or was cheaply done) in the special effects, and the DVD transfer is really bad. Maybe it came from a VHS tape?  The story does fairly well. I have only seen the first 4-5 shows so I will have to add more later. So far I would not call it earth shatteringly good. Just decent enough to watch.",1354579200,,313,3.9682539682539684
4443825,4,B004P3HA8I,"Didn't realize this was 13 years old when I ordered it but it caught me pretty quick and am now hooked, a bit repetitive on the street scenes, same people carrying the same bags etc to cut to the CDP, when watching it all I could think of was Blade Runner meets Max Payne, definitely has a 'Max Payne' flavour - cool!!",1343606400,,318,4.145161290322581
4443826,5,B004P3HA8I,"""Total Recall 2070"" is a very well written well made Showtime TV show, from start to finish.  Made in 1999, it has good charcters.  Starring Michael Easton, from ABC soaps, ""Port Charles"" and ""One Life To Live"", showcases his ability to portray the somewhat disgruntled cop.  Don't let the title fool you, it is really based on ""Blade Runner"" but they couldn't the rights to title the show ""Blade Runner 2070"".  It captures the feel of the Blade Runner world very well.  The effects are not top notch, very early CGI looking, like the ""Babylon 5"" show, but gets the job done in a great overall arcing story for the whole season.  Very good charcters, acting and great continuity writing, made this one of the best scifi shows no one saw.  The actor Karl Pruner, that plays Easton's partner, Favre (Yes, like Brett Favre), does as good as job as an andriod as Brent Spiner did as Data.  Too bad it was only on Showtime and couldn't find an audience.",1327968000,24,948,4.535294117647059
4443827,4,B004P3HA8I,"This little noticed show was underrated and only lasted one excellent season. Well conceived and executed, good acting and directing leaves one wanting more. Unique, very enjoyable. One trip to Mars, not much in common with the movie.",1312934400,16,234,5.184210526315789
4443828,5,B004P3HA8I,"Total Recall 2070 is about a dystopian near feature. The world is run by powerful companies who can do about anything to anyone. David Hume is a detective at the Citizen's Protection Bureau, when his partner is killed by a rouge android he is partnered with Ian Farve who happens to be the first Alpha android. The show is a science fiction cop show and most of the episodes is based around some atrocity one of the huge companies is doing and David and Ian fighting it, there is also plenty of sub plots including allot of them based around David's wife Olivia. The overarching metaplot of the series is trying to find out where Ian comes from and sorting out all the threads in a huge conspiracy.

This series have great characters. The setting is close enough to ours to be recognizable but it is darker, a warning of what might happen if cooperations who only think about money and profit is allowed to run loose and unchecked. The science fiction elements of this show blends very naturally into the setting and do not feel forced. One thing I could nitpick on is that almost all of the street scenes is shot with the same set and also the commercials on the billboards and on radios and such are always the same, this is a minor thing but it would have given a greater sense of realism if things where changed up a bit now and again.

The actors in Total Recall do a great job and at the end of the series one really care about these folks. Now talking about the ending, do not worry I am not going to spoil anything. However I just wanted to say that with shows that get canceled after only one season such as this one there is often not a real ending. I think they did a good job here. There is certainly plot lines that do not get a proper conclusion however all in all the ending felt satisfying, even if I would have loved to see more seasons.

Total Recall 2070 comes in a jewel case box, it is no bigger than a regular DVD cover and houses six DVD's inside with all of the 22 episodes. I love this as it saves space and is very practical. There is not really much extras on here, but the episodes themselves is presented in great quality. I also have to mention that I love the music of this show, it fits perfectly with it's general Cyberpunk themes.

If you like Cyberpunk, if you like science fiction or if you like cop shows then I think you will like this one. There are some very minor gripes I have with the locations detailing but other than that this is an amazing show and I really, really recommend it.",1307145600,55,2526,4.2782426778242675
4443829,5,B004P3HA8I,Yet to get to the end it but enjoyed up it the episode Im up to at the moment would recommend it to anyone,1378512000,,106,3.4583333333333335
4443830,5,B004P3HA8I,"you will love this science fiction show, its a bit complex, but not if u pay attention to what you are watching, I loved it",1375574400,,123,3.96
4443831,4,B004P3HA8I,"I became involved with this series by watching the pilot on a collection of sci fi movies. I found out it was on tv first back in 2000. I probably missed it because the series was on cable which I still do not have.
The show has a good premise, that in the future corporations call the shots on society whether it be law or politics.
Robots and recall memories and virtual reality are all explored. The show is good sci fi entertainment and really deserves a look.
I have been following sci fi for many years and was quite surprised this show was not heard from while on cable at the time it aired. I believe that more fans might have enjoyed it, if it saw sydication or a regular network slot. It is a good show and I do think the writing is up to par with other shows with much larger followings.
Give it a try I hope you will enjoy it.",1373500800,2,838,4.084848484848485
4443832,5,B004P3HA8I,I have to be truthful & say I haven't watched any of this but I bought it cause  friend recommended it to me. so guess I will see it was fast getting here & a new set,1371600000,,166,3.4864864864864864
4443833,5,B004P3HA8I,"I watched this show when it first aired, but never got the see the end. I've waiting and waited for it to come out on DVD. Finally, my wish was granted!

The discs: 22 episodes on 6 disc, 4 per except the last, which has 2. They're all in a compact case barely thicker than a single disc's case, plus a slipcase. Don't look for in-depth interviews and ""making of"" extras. Video and sound quality are both very good.

The show: Looks to me like someone dipped into PKD's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" (the novel basis for the movie ""Bladerunner"" [the title came from an unrelated story by Alan E. Nourse about a blackmarket dealer in medical supplies]) to flesh out this show based loosely on his short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale."" Mars is here mainly as a reference -- there's only one trip to Mars -- and we don't have a hero who regains his memory of saving the world. We also don't have the action sequences of either Arnold's or Colin's movies, and that's not a problem for me. This is more police procedural, with conspiracy theory and the existential ""who am I and where do I come from,"" so there's more thinking and less fast action. The look overall is very dark, in keeping with the worldview and situations.

Some stories work better than others. The repeated use of the same crowd scenes is annoying, but this wasn't a high-budget show. The acting... some is better than others. None of the main cast were/are A-list actors, but they all did a creditable job; their characters were believable even though I didn't always quite believe in what the script had them doing. I wouldn't mind seeing them in something else. The minor characters, particularly the one-offs, were a mixed bag; performances ran the gamut from wooden to good.

I think the casual SF viewer will probably not be drawn into this show. I know that anyone looking for action a la Arnold is not going to be satisfied. But hardcore SF fans will find much to like. At the current price, it's certainly worth adding to your video library.",1366934400,7,2038,4.544959128065395
4443834,5,B004P3HA8I,"A bit dated but still good storytelling.  Some episodes really well done, even today.  Goes in-depth on the ideas of artificial intelligence and what really defines what is human.  The episode with the Martian artifact was intense and probably the best if also the darkest one.  A good legacy to the original Philip K Dick storyline.",1364083200,2,333,4.892857142857143
4443835,4,B004P3HA8I,I loved the movie Total Recall and thought this was a good shoot off from the film. The series almost reminded me of Blade Runner (another of my favorites) with its back drop surroundings. I feel anyone who liked those 2 movies would enjoy this series.,1363392000,,252,4.5
4443836,5,B004P3HA8I,"Love it, love it, love it. This is a box set of DVDs from an original Showtime SciFi series based on the storyline/mythology of the original movie Total Recall.  The series was outstanding but was unfortunately cancelled after 1 season (like so many other good quality SciFi shows sometimes).  The writing is great.  There is plenty of action.  It keeps in-line with the original story.  And lead actor, Michael Easton, is a terrific actor and makes this series a Total Success.  Michael is known for Sci Fi work on VR5, Two, and others although he is best known today for his career on daytime dramas.  He is a super attractive, very compelling, very believeable actor.  I am so glad this whole series finally came out in box set.  I just wish there were more episodes.",1363046400,3,770,4.644444444444445
4443837,4,B004P3HA8I,I watched this series when it came out and had to get it on DVD when I saw it had been released.  It expands on the world created by Phillip K. Dick and is more of the Bladerunner world than either Total Recall movies.,1362268800,3,218,3.9545454545454546
4443838,5,B004P3HA8I,I watched the show when it was on showtime and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm so happy its available on dvd after not thinking it would happen after so long. Great screen quality. Good short lived series.,1358640000,,200,4.583333333333333
8437443,5,B004P3HA8I,"An excellent series that briefly hit mainstream TV in the  wee small hours. Thankfully I am a night owl and got to watch it. Yes, it has more of a connection to Blade Runner overall - but it does use the Recall concept quite elegantly. What I particularly liked was Ian - the incredible artificial life form more human than human - and the medical examiner which was a wonderful character that pre-dates our popular forensic shows like CSI. It didn't need a lot of fancy gizmos to sell the story because the stories were strong and the direction spot on. It just worked! Gone too soon, though and hard to find now.",1466812800,,614,4.433628318584071
8437444,5,B004P3HA8I,It is Great!,1450396800,,12,3.3333333333333335
8437445,5,B004P3HA8I,An excellent S-F series. It only lasted one season. But is complete as a good mini-series as far as it went.,1445040000,,108,4.190476190476191
8437446,5,B004P3HA8I,Good dvd,1440288000,,8,3.5

8437448,4,B004P3HA8I,I'm so glad I got series got see the whole show to bad it didn't have very writing but good  CGI effects,1429401600,,104,3.727272727272727
8437449,5,B004P3HA8I,"I love this series. I saw it one TV several years ago and really enjoyed it. This series reminds me more of ""Bladerunner"" instead of the ""Total Recall"" effort. This show has normal looking characters and kept my interest more than the 'Arnold Effort' of Total Recall. The characters in 'Total Recall' looked like they should have died during a nuclear war. Towards the end of the movie, it became silly and took off into left field and didn't fit into the first part of the film.
""Total Recall 2070"" has a more consistant story line and doesn't sway from the opening plot.
I would recommend this series to any Sc-Fi watcher.",1412380800,2,624,4.580357142857143
8437450,5,B004P3HA8I,The ultimate sifi. Why oh why was this series never carried on? BIG MISTAKE,1412208000,,75,4.428571428571429
8437451,5,B004P3HA8I,"Forgotten masterpiece of Scifi. Too small budget and some cheesy scenes, but very nice atmosphere and some very nicely written episodes!",1408492800,,136,5.523809523809524
8437452,5,B004P3HA8I,"Haven't viewed all the dvds, so I can't comment on the overall technical quality- so far so good.
For the content of the shows, that's a matter of personal taste that should be left up to the viewer:  I'm a fan, but that's a personal taste.",1405641600,,240,4.217391304347826
