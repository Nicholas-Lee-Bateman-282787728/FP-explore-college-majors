8025886,1,B0002C80XA,"I first got to start off saying I really wanted to be able to support my Christian peoples.  We watched this video and I said all the way through this I am missing something.  Mario had a lot of blame placed his way and I just didn't understand where it came from.  It hurt me to say this, but it was terrible.  It looked bootlegged.  I don't mean someone bootlegged the original and sold it to me, I mean it actually looked like it was taped bootlegged.  I understand they were trying to send a message of God, but they really missed the mark on this one.  So in so many words don't waste your time.",1132876800,28,600,4.120689655172414
