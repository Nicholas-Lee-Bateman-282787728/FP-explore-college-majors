2156790,5,B00061LKAC,"Ms. Rose, (this is her first feature documentary attempt funded by herself and her husband)  comes off here like a real ""patriot"" in the purest sense. The questions Ms. Rose asks require us to self reflect . Her point is simple and direct. A nation gets the government it deserves. In ""Liberty Bound"" we are reminded that we probably deserve better. As Howard Zinn states, with all the power we have, to have used it to benefit the few in the way that has happened is just disgraceful. After seeing ""Liberty Bound"" it's hard to disagree.",1097798400,12,537,4.59375
2156791,5,B00061LKAC,"You have to hand it to Christine Rose.  She saw the problems developing in our country since 9-11 was exploited for political purposes and decided to make a movie about it.  Travelling across the country, she has great interviews with Howard Zinn, Michael Parenti, and others.  She finds people who have been victimized by the Patriot Act.  Altogether a very accomplished film from a first time director. Was very popular when it was shown in France.

 One of the most harrowing segments is a real time voice recording of the air traffic controllers trying to contact the doomed flight that crashed in Pennsylvannia on 9-11.  The screen is blank except for the captioned voices of the controllers and finally, a terrorist voice is heard.  That section will haunt you.  This movie shows what one determined person (working with friends and relatives) can accomplish.  Bravo!",1097798400,14,873,5.0
2156792,5,B00061LKAC,"This is a Grassroots film already receiving fantastic reviews in France.  Americans in Paris have had TRUTH before we in America have.  Our news/reviews/and promotional outlets are now being exposed as untrustworthy, This is A ""TWO THUMBS UP"" for TRUTH exposing the lack of respect police & government employees have on the people of the United States of America.  These police/gov't officials are also your kin, your friends and your neigbors.  WAKEUP America, this film documents TRUTH you ignore. Continue to ignore and liberty is lost for ""None are so hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free"" {Quoting Johann W.

2156793,5,B00061LKAC,"Feel safer after the creation of the Department of Homeland Security? Feel okay about the USAPATRIOT Act and what it could be used for? Do you believe you really know what your government is doing? If you answered ""no"" to any of these questions then this film is for you.

First time filmmaker Christine Rose has created a powerful documentary about the post-9/11 state of the nation. She starts out traveling the country in search of the truth about our post-9/11 increased security measures and individual liberties. What starts out as a simple set of questions turns into a damning indictment of the heavy-handed reaction of the Bush administration to the 9/11 attacks.

Rose tackles issues about 9/11 and the new powers of the FBI and Homeland Security Department that Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 911"" barely touched upon. The questions asked are excellent food for thought. How do we live in a more secure state without giving up our liberties? Is the Constitution still relevant? Can we trust the investigative powers of the FBI and CIA after the complete failure of the system on 9/11 and the run up to the Iraq war? Moore indicts Saudi Arabia and its close ties to the Bush family, but Rose suggests that there may be more to the story. My take? There's always more to the story when it comes to politics and policy.

Rose makes excellent use of interview material with respected historian Howard Zinn, author Michael Parenti, and investigative journalist Michael C. Ruppert. It should be noted that Rose completed her film before the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission, but that does not make any of her or her interviewee insights irrelevant. The conclusion of the film is sobering and thoughtful. Rose dares to raise disturbing questions about fascism in the U.S., secrecy in government, and the loss of our liberties. The questions raised should provoke hours of discussion with your friends and family and should generate a few letters to your Congressional representatives. I look forward to Rose's next documentary.",1095638400,21,2029,4.979351032448378

8036373,5,B00061LKAC,"Without hesitation, this is the best documentary that explains the American condition in the last 10 years.

It is totally sincere. I cannot express enough my appreciation for it.

I grew up less than 35 miles from where Christine Rose did.

It was quite an experience.

This film is pure American spirit.

I don't care about your short-term politics during this-or-that politician's term in office.

This is from the heart.

Although a new administration might seem to nullify this film, it doesn't. It only reinforces it.

The truths contained within remain true to this day. Nobel prizes notwithstanding.

I watch this film a few times per year, and it literally brings tears to my eyes. I'm speaking as a male.",1256169600,,714,4.883333333333334

8036375,5,B00061LKAC,"Even in this post 9/11 age, when much has been said in print and film, this movie asks questions and explores possibilities that some of our most courageous filmakers and journalists have yet dared to venture. The writing and editing are superb and the movie flows with the use of archived footage and original cinematography mixed with interviews from a wide variety of sources to create a very compelling piece of work. Howard Zinn and others speak their minds freely and give us much to think about regarding the future of our country. We're given a lot of information and a new way to look at the world and the U.S.A. as it is today and what direction it might be heading in the future if we're not careful.",1199318400,2,711,4.51937984496124

8036377,5,B00061LKAC,"I was introduced to Liberty Bound when it first came out about 5 years ago, and I have just recently rewatched it, and felt moved to write this review.  At that time, I was still uncertain what had actually happened on 9/11, but I felt that our government wasn't telling us the whole story.  I remember watching in horror, as so many people did, as those huge towers came crashing down.
What Ms. Rose has accomplished, with a video camera and an incredible desire to speak, film and record the truth, is astonishing.  Even though this work is not as polished as Michael Moore's film, I believe it is just as important, if not more so.  Christine didn't have any particular connections or a large film crew or a big budget, but her film is easily as biting, and in some ways more so, that Mr. Moore's.  The one scene that will live forever in my mind is when President Bush is told that the plane has hit the second tower, and the look on his face.  It is at once unreadable and extremely chilling, what was this man thinking?  Only history will give us that answer.
I recommend the film highly to anyone who has followed the tale of woe that this US government has perpetrated on it's own people.  It was the first, and in my opinion, the best documentary on the subject from the perspective of pure, innocent inquiry - What really happened? And what is going to happen now??",1195948800,5,1375,4.407114624505929
8036378,5,B00061LKAC,"Liberty Bound was my introduction to a wave of politically driven documentaries giving insight to the 9-11 tragedy and the Bush Administration.  I found this film to be a very informative catalyst of deeper thought...it has led me to ask questions I had never thought to ask before, such as ""are we truly safe?"", and ""who is the real enemy?"".  The audio recording of the interrogated man on the train is particularily haunting, and something I never thought could happen in our country in this day and age.  Are we truly a nation that should take pride in our right to free speech, religious, and racial tolerance?  These questions, and more, will emerge in the minds of Liberty Bound viewers for years to come.  We must remember that to grow and gain a better understanding of the world around us, we must never stop asking questions.  Even if we are set in our opinions and beliefs.  We are all eternal students of life.  Christine Rose has done a wonderful job as a teacher, of sorts, by bringing this knowledge to the public to aid in our quest for understanding why things are the way they are.

Hopefully this film will stand as an educational tool for future generations learning about the history of our nation, and remind them of ALL the struggles our nation faced after the devastation September 11, 2001.",1194998400,5,1315,4.658008658008658

8036380,5,B00061LKAC,"There have been dozens of documentary films released in the last two years chronicling the state of America and its place in the world today.  Films such as OUTFOXED, UNCOVERED, BUSH FAMILY FORTUNES, HIJACKING CATASTROPHE, UNPRECEDENTED and MARTIAL LAW cover issues such as the state of Civil Liberties, our entry into the War in Iraq, the state of the media, the business dealings of the Bush family and making a case that at the very least, the government knew about 9/11 and failed to act.  LIBERTY BOUND is the best of the bunch.  I bought this DVD knowing nothing about it and I was pleasantly surprised.  The film has a raw and personal quality to it that most documentaries fail to capture.  The narrator/director travels far and wide to explore the state of post-9/11 America.  In the process she assembles a unique sampling of testimonials from American's who have had their constitution rights violated as well as activists and historians such as Michael Ruppert and Howard Zinn respectively.  Zinn's commentary in particular is strikingly surreal and non-partisan as always.  The director also manages to make a convincing comparison between our president and a certain 20th century German dictator by reminding the viewer that Hitler was a politician before he was a dictator.  He was able to usurp power by staging a terrorist attack and subsequently asking people to give up their liberties in place of security in the ""homeland.""

I can't recommend this film enough to anyone, liberal or conservative, who is concerned about the state of US affairs.",1112313600,9,1564,5.003861003861004
8036381,5,B00061LKAC,"This film responds to the suspicions of millions who have woken up and started to wonder if our civil liberties are being eroded and if major media is reporting the entire truth about what our government is really doing. You'll hear from people who have been interrogated by the Secret Service and threatened with arrest for doing such benign things as sending an email, turning around during a Bush speech, and having a philosophical discussion on a train. Through Ms. Rose's interviews and research of archived footage, Liberty Bound explores unanswered questions surrounding the attacks of 9/11, the government's reasons for going to war, and if recent occurrences in our country are signs that we are moving toward becoming a fascist state.  As the saying goes, the truth will first make you miserable, but it will set you free.",1097884800,15,832,4.985611510791367
