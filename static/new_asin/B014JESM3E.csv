8730982,5,B014JESM3E,"This is an amazing quality bootleg Bluray of a really great broadcast. For those of you with diamond screens and thousand dollar audio set-ups, you'll likely find problems. However, for a fan of Foo Fighters who just has a Bluray player plugged into a TV - this will bring great clear Bluray enjoyment. Also, this IS the show where Davie Grohl stops during ""Skin n Bones"" to kick out an audience member who started a fight.",1532822400,,423,4.578947368421052
