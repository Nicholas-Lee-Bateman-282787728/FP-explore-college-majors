4123510,4,B003H05VUY,"I had never heard of this riot, and am glad I have another piece of history related to gays during the 20th century. This puts the Stonewall riots in perspective.",1362182400,5,162,4.433333333333334
4123511,4,B003H05VUY,"The ""riot"" portion of the film lasted all but a minute or so, not much really and not really a riot by today's standards either. The film, in my belief, would be better described as a documentary about the rights of transsexuals in 1960's San Francisco. Low budget but definitely informative and contains a bevy of neat vintage footage of drag queens and transsexuals, both in video and photograph form. Since there is not a whole lot in the way of gay documentaries from that era, I think it is a must see for any homosexual person interested in gay civil rights from days past.",1354147200,9,579,4.523809523809524
4123512,5,B003H05VUY,"I live in San Francisco's Tenderloin, the neighborhood featured in this documentary and pass by the corner of Turk and Taylor where the riots took place nearly every day. I always stop and pay respects and homage to the events that took place there and those that came before me so that I may live free today. There is no evidence of the revolutionary riots that kickstarted the modern gay rights movement in the city. The events featured in this film predated the Stonewall riots by 3 years but is seldom or never recognized. Stonewall and the New York queers get all the credit for the outburst that made history but some tired-on-their feet working ""girls"" of the Tenderloin in San Francisco were pushed beyond their limit on a hot August night in 1966 when cops raided Compton's Cafeteria and started harrassing the transgender girls for their self-expression. Dressing across your gender was against the law and grounds for arrest which meant that queens could go to jail for wearing mascara. If you're gay in the US, you are conditioned to revere Stonewall but how many knew about Compton's before seeing this film? That area of the Tenderloin was decimated and completely changed by the crack epidemic of the 1980s and the gay presence made up by the marginalized trannies and queer rebel youth of Vanguard filtered away. The Aunt Charlie's drag dive bar is one of the oldest in the city and still sits across the street from the Compton's site but other than that the area is devoid of queerness. The Bulldog Bathhouse is a few doors down from the former Comptons's site but is a private residence today reconditioned as a live-work loft. Although the neighborhood is part of my daily stomping grounds and regular route, I will never become desensitized to the events that took place there To think that it used to be against the law to dress in drag or even in flamboyant boy drag is unimaginable today. A world without mascara is a world not worth living in so these queens were the original martyr mavens of queendom. The documentary features real footage from the 1960s and interviews with the last surviving trannies who witnessed real history take place. I am fortunate to be able to have met and actually know a couple of the queens featured in the film because of where I live.  The T in GLBT has been silenced for too long.  The T is for transgender and Tenderloin and totally terrific.  This film is part of San Francisco queer history and should be viewed along with Vicki Marlane's Forever's Gonna Start Tonight. She was a headlining chanteuse at  Aunt Charlie's and activist before her recent death.",1349308800,14,2620,4.726477024070022
4123513,4,B003H05VUY,This film has pretty low production quality but the content is great and very informative. I strongly suggest taking the time to check it out.,1345939200,7,142,4.72
4123514,5,B003H05VUY,Our collective history is so important. This was enlightening. New chapter for me as I thought the LGBT movement chapter at Stonewall was the first riot. It wasn't!,1464739200,,164,4.892857142857143
4123515,3,B003H05VUY,"While I still can't quite fathom why people want to change their sex, the film shows the depth of suffering endured by those who do. They are persecuted by the police, in league with the cafeteria owners and a broader clientele of 'normal' people. They have trouble finding jobs as anything but street walkers who live very dangerous lives. Most of them do not seem well-educated, so their possibility for economic advancement is severely limited. The film covers all of this quite well and in terms of some interesting case studies. Still, I could not relate to anything but their suffering and the injustice behind it. The basic sexual aspect continued to pass me by.",1457222400,,669,4.826086956521739

4123517,3,B003H05VUY,Definitely new information that I had not previously known. I guess I was expecting a little more on LGB as this was focused heavily on the Transgender community.,1439596800,,162,4.821428571428571
4123518,5,B003H05VUY,An informative and well-told story about a riot that took place before the more well-known Stonewall Riots of 1969 that was led specifically by transgender and queer activists. I personally have never heard about this riot which took place in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco and so I am grateful for the research that it took to make a film about this event in history that is seldom spoken about when one discusses U.S. history. I feel that most people are not educated enough about sexuality and gender therefore I think this is a perfect film for those who are looking to understand further the history of transgender people in the U.S. looking specifically at San Francisco.,1437350400,,687,4.830508474576271

4123530,5,B003H05VUY,This movie examines an incident in San Francisco in 1966 that pre-dates Stonewall.  I had never heard of this event in LGBT history.,1392595200,,132,4.739130434782608
4123531,5,B003H05VUY,"I wish there was a companion book. The interviews are amazing, especially Amanda St James. And it's great having the first hand commentaries filmed.
 Not much vintage footage, but plenty of pics.
Great doc!!",1392422400,,207,5.088235294117647
4123532,4,B003H05VUY,"I recommend this documentary to anyone interested in broadening their knowledge of queer history. The Compton's Cafeteria Riot was an important first step in queer activism, and yet gets forgotten in favor of the more famous Stonewall riots. This documentary does a fantastic job of explaining the culture and mood of the Tenderloin before and after the 1966 riot, with a great mix of testimonials by people who were there at the time and additional context. I was particularly impressed with the frank and respectful way that this film dealt with prostitution and police brutality.

My students and I very much enjoyed watching Screaming Queens, and we all learned a lot.",1391904000,9,672,5.054054054054054
4123533,4,B003H05VUY,Learned a lot about the West Coast uprising similar to Stonewall Inn. I didn't even know that this happened. Good historical record of  an event that helped us reach the point we are at today. Always nice to learn more of our gay history...,1391731200,3,240,4.454545454545454
4123534,5,B003H05VUY,"a great and enlightening film. I was required to watch it for a gender and women's studies course in college, and I really enjoy the history about a LGBT militant movement about which I've never heard.",1382140800,,201,4.611111111111111
4123535,5,B003H05VUY,"I love this documentary. It gets to the heart of the issues surrounding problems that those who are Transgender still face today. Susan Stryker and company put some significant effort into the telling of this story. And it is a story that needed to be told because it was a significant victory for the community. This event ""The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria"" predated the infamous Stonewall riot and it got very little press. Both of those riots had a huge Transgender presence despite the notion that Stonewall was about Gay rights. I would suggest some further reading on Stonewall in the book by Martin Duberman. It has a very comprehensive view of the riot from the perspective of the lives of some of the key players, including Sylvia Rivera. Remembering Compton's, which was really a lost history prior to this documentary, is essential for those who are Transgender because it reveals the lives of the transwomen of the Tenderloin and demonstrates that we have come a long way since then, but we still have a long way to go to achieve the rights that other Americans take for granted.",1381449600,,1090,4.772486772486772
4123536,5,B003H05VUY,really opens your eyes to the travels taken by those to get equality and love to prevail in the us to where we are today with it.  which is still no where close to where we should be but each day....it is closer.  Thank you to all in the movie.  love it.,1379203200,,254,3.8461538461538463
4123537,5,B003H05VUY,Being a history buff this story was never talk about and I didn't know that it happen before Stonwall in New York. So I really enjoy the movie.,1377388800,,143,4.142857142857143
4123538,5,B003H05VUY,exceptionally well done video.  it was great to learn more about the history of the TS struggle here in San Francisco,1373414400,,117,4.571428571428571
4123539,4,B003H05VUY,"I'm not sure a general audience would find it as interesting, but if you're a modern history or LGBT history buff I think you'll find a lot you didn't already know.",1370563200,3,164,4.32258064516129
