7812474,5,6301481011,"I just ordered all four of the original (with original dubbing) Pippi movies. Pippi Longstocking, Pippi in the South Seas, Pippi on the Run, Pippi goes on Board. I cannot wait to get them!! No one could understand how absolutely OBSESSED I was with these movies as a child and how much they mean to me. Anytime my Grandma wanted to get some work done and I was getting in the way, she'd pop in the tape we recorded from the tv. I'd sit there all day watching them. I could watch them over and over again everyday! I wanted to be Pippi, I annoyed everyone with the songs (still do...), and to this day she is still my hero. An amazing rolemodel for children, believe it or not with all her crazy shinanigans. She was strong, confident, and forever free. Something we all need to take in. The bad dubbing doesn't bother me a bit, infact I prefer it, because it's what I remember as a kid. I didn't even notice how their mouths looked ""weird"" because they don't match the voices. I also can't wait to bring my cousins over to watch them with me again lol and to introduce them to my little brother who has heard me ramble on about her but has never seen them.",1312934400,,1156,4.259090909090909
