7861511,4,6304066074,"While not my favorite movie, initially purchased due to Kevin Smith, it isn't one I intend on throwing out.  The use of color and lighting, and particularly the actress' dresses, serve as a visual eye candy.  I confess I wasn't entirely sure what was going on until a third way through the movie when Micheal Hurst (a pleasant surprise!) showed up, but then I didn't care.  To me, it is a fun movie that I'll pull out once or twice a year and cuddle up on the couch to watch.  That being said, the plot isn't something for children or, I think, anyone under thirteen.

The movie starts out with our heroine, Dorthea Brook, in a splash of vivid red driving a coach (I think?  It could have been just a horse.  Odd camera angles...) to meet a ship that has just made port.  She is searching for an unattached man -Enter Kevin Smith as Lawrence Hayes- to woo her pregnant sister, who is addicted to both opium and her supplier.  In theory her baby sister will fall in love and leave the drug dealer/wanderer, and that is Dorthea's plan.  But, as everyone knows, things rarely go according to plan.

The cast of main characters also includes Anne Cooper, who is Dorthea's aide and (non-graphic, for those who are squeamish) lover, Fraser the Opium Dealing Traveling Man, and Iolus... I mean William Poyser a nobleman who is sadly lacking in the purse strings.  Dorthea loves Anne and likes, possibly loves Lawrence, yet she marries Poyser for his name like the shrewd business woman she is.  Lawrence loves Anne but marries Rose (the little sister) because a business arrange is a business arrangement.

Also, two of the above mentioned persons die though as I do not wish to spoil the ending -Which was a delightful twist to me.- I will decline from saying who.  All in all, Desperate Remedies was a delightful little romp if you have the time and inclination.  If you're looking for action or mystery, look elsewhere.  If you want Drama flavored with Harlequin Romance, this it is.",1366243200,2,1979,4.6085714285714285
7861512,5,6304066074,"Kevin Smith pre Xena!  Not as funny as the ""Down on the Farm""  of Xena but no missing the comedic talent he always displayed later on .  This is mostly a drama with some great views of young Kevin Smith",1355616000,,202,4.0
7861513,5,6304066074,"Rekindling an interest in Xena Warrior Princess, Hercules and Sinbad, three shows that I loved to watch with my friends when they aired in syndication, I found out that Kevin Todd Smith and Michael Hurst, the actors who played Ares and Iolas, did in 1993 a New Zealand movie called Desperate Remedies. It was with this movie that Robert Tapert discovered the production values of New Zealand and found some of the actors for his Greek mythology Universe in Hercules and Xena.

Not a very popular movie in North America, the only available copies I could find were a VHS tape Miramax released and a Region 4 DVD in the Amazon Marketplace. As the tape's a cut-and-crop version of the Widescreen original, I didn't get the same atmosphere I found when I saw clips of the movie on YouTube and on the Web. Fortunately, an Amazon Marketplace seller sold the uncut and complete copy of the movie on DVD. But as it's a Region 4 movie and since I don't think it will be in Region 1 or 2 for a long time, I encourage anybody to look on Amazon Marketplace to find copies of this movie. There are Amazon sellers selling this product at the right time, and there is on the Web  good software (i.e:VLC Player) that allows you to watch this movie on your computer.

Though the descriptions at the back of the region 4 DVD say that the story is 4.3 Full Screen, the image format I saw on the movie was Widescreen; for there were black bars at the bottom and top of the image and wider details to see. However, the movie is anamorphic, if you do intend to watch it on television with a region-free DVD Player. The soundtrack is Dolby Digital and the special features I found were the trailer, along with a commentary track from the directors. Not only that, I was pleased to find out the DVD had an extra scene that wasn't in the VHS tape. Indeed, it is a short scene where Lawrence Hayes knocks on a door and tries to meet with an ancient fellow. Under the dark lighting and camera angle used, the scene subtly answers Anne Cooper's suspicions that Lawrence Hayes is, as she says, ""a wild card"".

OF the story, we witness Dorothy Brooks, played by the perfect Jennifer Ward-Lealand, trying to stop her sister's addiction to opium and to her dealer by finding for that girl a future husband in Lawrence Hayes, a foreigner who just arrived from Birmingham and a character played by the late and gorgeous Kevin Todd Smith. As the same time, she has to deal with her closeted romance with Anne Cooper, a wedding with a businessman, played by her Husband Michael Hurst, while the New Zealand Wars occurs in the background.

Of the production values, I was marveled by the splendor of the sets and costumes of the actors. Indeed, some of them made me think l was watching a movie done in the 1920s, except in color and shot in FujiStock Film, which gave the images a grainy and wild look, reinforced by visuals and lighting effects closer to what German Expressionists and silent movies used at the early ages of cinema. Of the soundtrack, I loved how the filmmakers used Verdi's La Forza Del Destino as a leitmotif throughout the movie. It was the perfect tune to the opening credits and to the scenes where Dorothy and Lawrence Hayes meet for the first time. With the rest of the soundtrack and other tunes from Strauss, Berlioz, and the composer Peter Scholes, the movie has the perfect music for its excellent story.

As for the characters, I found their dilemmas absolutely convincing and well-written and their dialogues more powerful than I expected. The story was so good that, just like Ken Russell's movie Women in Love, I wished that the story didn't end and that I didn't had to leave those characters. Though I wish the story had a public reception as wide as the Piano, another excellent New Zealand that was released in 1993 and which I recommend to anybody who loved this movie.",1349913600,,3872,4.540114613180516
7861514,4,6304066074,"Overblown, overwrought and over-the-top.  That's what I was thinking early on.  And that's what I was still thinking at the end, but by then I had caught on that everyone involved was having a great deal of fun with the melodrama.  Whatever you may think of this film, I don't think you'll find it boring.  Quirky, fascinating performances; exceptional set design; bold use of colors; beautiful (if relentless) musical score.  It all adds up to a unique viewing experience.",969753600,4,473,4.936708860759493
7861515,4,6304066074,"An absolutely dead-on parody of the whole bodice-ripper genre, with performances so nuanced, earnest and perfectly-pitched that you're left completely breathless, trapped between howling over how utterly over-the-top it all is and yet so caught up in the fantasy fulfillment aspects that you find yourself moved and thrilled almost in spite of yourself. I shudder to think what would have happened if this film had been made in the U.S. -- smothered under realistic sets and costumes, with the actor's constantly winking and nudging you to make sure you know they're in on the joke. A brilliant -- and brilliantly used -- cast. Staggeringly inventive, wonderfully stylized design work. Drop dead costumes. This film is a major hoot in a way it would never have been if it had been filmed ""realistically"" or without actors fearless enough to play it completely, unashamedly, straight. Several people we've shown the film to have been utterly baffled by it, so you should be aware of that too. It's a difficult film to know what to make of. But if you enter into its world as wholeheartedly as everyone involved in its production seems to have, it's a wild ride, quite unlike anything else you're likely to see, ever.",965952000,14,1215,4.931707317073171
7861516,4,6304066074,"Guys: ever wondered what story was between the covers of those books in the romance section of a bookshop (have you ever been in a bookshop?), where the dashingly brooding hero is holding the beautifully swooning  heroine? Gals: want to see one of those stories on the screen? Folklorists  and storytellers: here is a reflex of the motifs and style of the genus of  stories exampled by that Lost In Space episode about the fifth dimension -  think of an atmospheric dreamscape (which is what any story really is, when  all is said and done).
The costume (millenary, actually) is superb. The  language is Historical Romance, in the mouths of all the characters, yet  never out of place. The scenery is evocatively suggestive (though never  actually external - just like historical romances are never actually  historical). The camera-work and soundtrack augment the atmosphere. The  acting is delightful, with the actors obviously enjoying themselves and the  story in the multi-layered plot and dialogue (for example, watch Anne  Cooper [Lisa Chappell] embroidering while conversing with William Poyser  [Michael Hurst] while they wait for Dorothea [Jennifer Ward-Leland]), and  there are several winks and nods to the audience (the film even ends when  the fat lady sings).
After seeing this film, some people may be like the  William Poyser character and never see (or at least comprehend) what is in  front of their face, while trying at the same time to continue imposing  their conformities on others. Other people may be like Anne Cooper, whose  heart ends up singing.
Tightly structured societies may feel this film  comes from a different planet (the story, after all, is about a woman,  Dorothea, who desperately sacrifices everything, including her happiness,  to help her sister. The only person in the whole world who brings something  to Dorothea, rather than taking from her, turns out to be a woman...), and  non-Australasian audiences may not pick up on the couple of tongue-in-cheek  jokes that poke fun at the traditional friendly rivalry between Australia  and New Zealand or satirise the world view of the newspaper barons, but  those are minor quibbles.
This is a beautiful film - a ballet of the  heart. And a multi-layered foreshadowing of what would come to be in  Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess (and beyond).
The multi-layeredness of it is almost as if it were a film version of  DVD's multiple-angle feature, centred around what happens to the  rubies.
In summary - this is a richly lush Dickens-Shakespeare-Cartland  film: Dickens in setting, Shakespeare in mood, Cartland in style (and Kiwi  in presentation).
I only wish there were more things in the world with  Lisa Chappell in them.
By the way, I bought the video locally for the  usual price of an ordinary video. I would like to see it on DVD.
