7884684,5,6305121303,"My dad is featured in this. A 34 year veteran of the Navy, and Master Chief SEAL, he knows truth from fiction, and this is not fiction.  From the reviews of those who weren't ""entertained"" enough, they probably saw the Hollywood version one-too-many times.  Excellent and realistic portayal of the U.S. Navy SEAL.",1119916800,10,313,4.886792452830188
7884685,4,6305121303,"This is a two-part video--one part on SEAL history, training, and tactics, with some actual footage of some Special Warfare operations...from UDT Frogmen at Normandy Beach, to SEAL snatches of the enemy in Vietnam, and  SEAL participation in Panama, Granada, and the Gulf War.  The second part  is an in-depth presentation of the role of the Stoner 63A light machine gun  in Vietnam...with its capability of giving a platoon of SEALs the  equivalent firepower of an infantry company!  Awesome firepower  demonstrations are supplemented by the expert testimony of retired SEAL Lt.  Cdr. Michael Walsh on the Stoner's capabilities (for more first-hand  accounts of such action...the reader is heartily referred to Walsh's book:  SEAL!).",936230400,24,734,5.415929203539823
