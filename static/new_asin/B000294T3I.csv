2069336,5,B000294T3I,"Whenever I go to a recital of opera I watch some videos that will be presented, so I prepare for the show. In my collection contained two versions of Gluck's Orfeo and Eurydice. A theater of San Carlo Napoli, DVD version without subtitles and another from Glyndebourne Festival Opera, recorded on VHS version and with subtitles in Portuguese. I watched the English version and had a pleasant surprise.

Traditional show, which refers to classical Greece. Parade Greek gods, nymphs, beautiful boys and evil beings. The costumes are classic and conservative scenarios cleared. Interesting is the descent of Orpheus to Ades, demonic figures dance and provoke a disorderly fashion. Highlight of the show, neither seems to be a production of 1982, the modernity of the scene. The long dance numbers were performed in a simple manner.

The image and sound are good, nothing to compare digital recordings and blu-ray today, but considering the period, we have video and audio quality.

Janet Baker was the star of English opera in the '80s. Your Giulio Cesare In Egitto from Handel's magnificent penalty be sung in English. His voice is crystal clear, his Orpheus is dramatic. Angelic voice of small and mezzo-soprano is not always combined with a male character. Compensates for this with great theatrical performance. Elizabeth Speiser is one that plagues Euridice Orpheus until he shows you the face. Beautiful voice, pure lyricism and beautiful tone for a singer of the 80s that I know.

The end is in fellowship, all danced happily alongside the Greek gods. Interesting version of Gluck's opera, libretto well written and inspired by the poet Ovid's Metamorphoses. I hope that the recitation of the San Pedro has that same level.

Sempre que vou a uma rcita assisto alguns vdeos da pera que ser apresentada, assim me preparo para o espetculo. No meu acervo constam duas verses do Orfeo e Eurdice de Gluck. Uma do teatro San Carlo de Napoli, verso em DVD sem legendas e outra do Glyndebourne Festival Opera , verso gravada em VHS e com legendas em portugus. Assisti a verso inglesa e tive uma grata surpresa.

Espetculo tradicional , que remete  Grcia clssica. Desfilam deuses gregos, ninfas, belos rapazes e seres demonacos. Os figurinos so clssicos e conservadores , os cenrios limpos. Interessante  a descida de Orfeu ao Ades, figuras demonacas danam e provocam de forma desordenada. Ponto alto do espetculo, nem parece ser uma produo de 1982, pela modernidade da cena. Os longos nmeros de dana foram executados de forma simples.

A imagem e o som so bons, nada que se compare as gravaes digitais e em blu-ray da atualidade, mas considerando-se o perodo, temos udio e vdeo de qualidade.

Janet Baker era a estrela da pera inglesa nos anos 80. Seu Giulio Cesare In Egitto de Handel  magnfico, pena ser cantado em ingls. Sua voz  cristalina, seu Orfeu  dramtico. Voz angelical e pequena de mezzo-soprano que nem sempre combina com um personagem masculino. Compensa isso com grande atuao cnica. Elizabeth Speiser  uma Eurdice que atormenta o Orfeu at que ele lhe mostre a face. Bela voz, puro lirismo e belo timbre para uma cantora da dcada de 80 que eu desconhecia.

O final  de confraternizao, todos danam felizes ao lado dos deuses gregos. Verso interessante da pera de Gluck, libreto bem escrito e com inspirao nas Metamorfoses do poeta Ovdio. Espero que a rcita do So Pedro tenha esse mesmo nvel.

2069338,5,B000294T3I,"Janet Baker has the most luscious voice I have heard.  It is here.  Moving, touching, the sound of devotion and love.  Please, please -- do I sound like an aria -- buy this, you will love it. If you can find her recording of the Brahms Alto Rhapsody get it! I admit there is something to what Mr. Weaver says.  But get it nonetheless. So many things get dated in one way or the other don't they?  And almost everything has its filler for fun.  Blame the French for that.  Gluck was making a living as well as a masterpiece. Baker is wonderful. That's what it is about.",1253750400,9,568,4.203703703703703
2069339,5,B000294T3I,"Yes, this is a beautiful no-nonsense traditional setting and Dame Janet Baker is a world-history-class singing actor working with an outstanding conductor.  My only complaint is there's an awful lot of blue--blue light, blue scenery.  I started to think I was under water.

I resisted learning this piece until recently because there are no men but one cannot understand Mozart nor Wagner without it.  Nor Haydn's CREATION.  Nor FIDELIO.

Note to fans of the piece: you can obtain a DVD of a low-budget performance in English with an amazing charismatic up-and-coming coloratura-capable countertenor by contacting the Brooklyn Repertory Opera.  I'll bet money this is not the last time you will hear/read the name Nicholas Tamagna, Countertenor.  The chorus is great too, especially the basses....;-O))))",1243555200,4,804,5.42741935483871
2069340,3,B000294T3I,The music of this production is good and Janet Baker who sings Orfeo is wonderful. The angel of love is a little corny but sung well. The problem with this production is the last half hour consists of a boring contra dance and it all seems very dated (the production is 25 years old). The first hour and a half is very artistically done with beautiful coloring in the costumes. The production is worth seeing because of Baker.,1232409600,7,426,4.4743589743589745
2069341,5,B000294T3I,"This is the opera adaptation of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, as described by Ovid in the Metamorphoses.  Preceded by Moteverdi's La Favola di Orfeo and by several other reinterpretations of the same myth, Orfeo ed Euridice by Christoph Willibald Gluck is considered by some as the first opera in the modern sense.  It is the oldest opera in the standard repertoire, its first performance dating back to 1762.
The story - although lacking many of the original details -  is reasonably accurate.  Having lost his wife Eurydice to a snake bite, Orpheus is allowed by the gods to descend into Hades and bring her back.  As in many life situations (in this case,  ""beyond life situations""), there is a condition for the mission to be completed successfully: he should never look directly at his wife until they are back into the world of the living.  Unfortunately Orpheus does  look at her and this is where the Greek myth and the opera diverge.  Orpheus loses his wife forever, in the myth.  He is allowed to go on living with her, in the opera.  In fact, the final scene, set in the temple of Amore, consists of solos, choruses and dances in praise of love and of the couple whose love was sufficiently strong to defeat all obstacles, including death.
This particular interpretation of our opera - which incidentally only includes three main characters - was filmed in 1982 as  part of  the Glyndebourne Festival Opera performances.  It is sung in Italian - by mezzo soprano Janet Baker (Orfeo), soprano Elisabeth Speiser (Euridice) and soprano Elisabeth Gale (Amore) - with the accompaniment of the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus - which also performs the ballet segments.  Optional subtitles are available in English, Spanish, French and German.
Both the music and the ballet scenes are captivating.  Particularly unforgettable are the descent into Ades - where disgusting creatures, in a predominantly reddish environment, dance disorderly around Orpheus thus hindering his journey - and the depiction of the Elysian Fields - where the turmoil dies down,  the predominant color turns to blue,  and the Blessed Spirits move in an orderly manner while performing the famous dance.
The  celebrated  aria ""Che Faro' senza Euridice"" (What Will I do without Eurydice) , which Orpheus sings, following Eurydice`s second death, is touchingly beautiful.
My only objections - of minor importance - are: the stage is probably too small and not so well suited for the ballet performances. While in the Elysian Fields, Orpheus sings ""Che Puro Ciel, Che Chiaro Sol"" (What a Clear Sky, What a Bright Sun), but the environment is a deep blue, same as the one where the Blessed Spirits perform their dance.  British mezzo-soprano Dame Janet Baker sings like an angel, but is unconvincing as a man (yes, the opera  calls for a contralto or mezzo-soprano for the part and this is usually played by a woman).  Despite the makeup and clothing, there is no doubt that we are looking at a woman and not a man.  But then again, Dame Baker may take this as a compliment rather than a criticism.",1205366400,26,3117,4.904580152671755
2069342,5,B000294T3I,"It seems to me that the only filmed ""Orfeo"" anyone ever talks about is the one from Covent Garden with the modern setting, while this one is all but ignored. I don't see why. This is a wonderful performance. Dame Janet Baker's acting is near perfect. The last time I watched this video, I was completely blown away.",1043884800,7,315,4.448275862068965

8024157,5,B000294T3I,"Dame Janet Baker and Glyndebourne Festival Opera produced this captivating beautiful opera.  I am sorry that I am only just now discovering Dame Janet Baker after she retired with this performance. She is a marvelous Bel Canto mezzo soprano and plays this heart rending part to perfection.  This is a beautiful production in a small theater that is known for its high standards. Elizabeth Gale as the goddess of love was also outstanding. The quality of this DVD in picture and audio is also top notch.  .  I was also not familiar with the works of Christoph Gluck the composer.  I now know that he wrote about 30 operas.  This one must be his most famous.  I understand that this opera has always been in the standard repertoire.

8024161,5,B000294T3I,"Celebrate the composer's 300th birthday with this Janet Baker Orfeo from Glyndebourne, by far the finest and most traditionally-staged of all of Gluck's operas currently on DVD.  And if you consider the state of opera DVDs in the world today, with their updated settings, trench coats etc ... it's absolutely amazing this was even recorded at all.  Sure, it is one of the pivotal compositions in music history, but that's no guarantee it would be popular today.  It's not loud and flashy like Tosca, or fast and witty like Marriage of Figaro.  It's just simple, tender, and beautiful.  It's amazing we have it recorded, and even more amazing in a traditional production.  I recommend it most highly.",1396656000,6,699,4.931623931623932

8024163,4,B000294T3I,"This is a very good production of one of the most beautiful operas ever written.  You can't go wrong here.  Janet Baker is the best ever singing and acting.  However, I prefer a male singing Orpheus.  Orpheus was a man.

in French - ' J'ai perdu mon Eurydice'.  When a man sings this aria it is usually in Italian, 'Che faro senza Euridice'.  Pavarotti sang this aria and more recently, Roberto Alagna sang it in French.  I am more accustomed to hearing a woman sing it and that is great.  But, Orpheus is a male role and really should be played by a man and not a woman or countertenor.",1386547200,,587,4.263636363636364
8024164,5,B000294T3I,"Peter Hall's 1982 production of Gluck's ""Orfeo ed Euridice"" at Glyndebourne was Dame Janet Baker's last appearance on the operatic stage.  Read her autobiography, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Circle/dp/0531098761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Circle</a>"" for a touching description of what this production meant to her.  Glyndebourne was also the stage where she first appeared in an opera--as Rosa in Smetana's ""The Secret.""  I believe this role as Orfeo to be one of her most moving portrayals, and her two soprano colleagues, Elisabeth Speiser as Euridice and Elizabeth Gale as Amore lend beautiful musical support.

Gluck's music is absolutely ravishing.  After Orfeo's confrontation with the Furies, the scene with Euridice and the Blessed Spirits plays so tranquilly on the senses, it makes me wish for an Elysian Field in my own life.  Alas, it is only a musical interval before Orfeo attempts to lead Euridice back to the Outer World and back to life.  When he is finally forced to turn and look at his wife and she returns to death, his lament,""Che Faro Senza Euridice"" is the saddest aria in all of opera.  I broke down and cried the first time I heard Janet Baker singing it in this production.  If my husband should happen to die before me, I'll never be able to listen to this operatic DVD again.

The final deus ex machina is a definite anti-climax, but perhaps it was necessary for eighteenth century audiences to paper over the raw wound of Euridice's second death with a falsely happy ending.  I also own the made-for-TV film of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monteverdi-L-Orfeo/dp/B000JJSRMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monteverdi - L'Orfeo</a>,"" directed and designed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, that was based on a 1975 production for the Zurich Opera House, and the contrast between the two endings could hardly be greater.  Monteverdi's Euridice stays dead and his Orfeo ascends to heaven with Apollo.  Both, of course stray from the original Greek story where Orpheus returns from Hades without Euridice and is eventually torn apart by the Bacchantes.  I'd like to find a DVD of Haydn's version of Orfeo's story as it most resembles the Greek legend.

This production is not as visually stunning as Ponelle's, but it perfectly fits the music and the dance.  I was particularly taken with the animalistic Furies crawling up and down the iron gate that barred (temporarily) Orfeo's entrance into Hades.  The languid movements of the Blessed Spirits and their pale blue costumes made the Elysian Field scene appear as though it were being played under water.  It worked perfectly for me.

Highly recommended",1376956800,11,2712,5.444976076555024
8024165,5,B000294T3I,"Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice is a truly wonderful opera, a bit different than the operas that followed Gluck in the Opera Seria and Bel Canto periods. The performance is extremely well done. The emphasis on instrumental as well as voice music is beautifully performed and the ballet parts integrate perfectly in the production.",1307664000,2,324,5.132075471698113
