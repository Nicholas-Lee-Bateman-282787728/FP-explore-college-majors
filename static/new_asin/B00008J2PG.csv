1849482,5,B00008J2PG,A fantastic movie; Peck is great as is Plummer. A little known story that needs to be retold. If you are a  World War 2 buff and/or a person of faith you will love this movie.,1510790400,,175,3.861111111111111

1849485,4,B00008J2PG,"The story of Monsignor O'Flaherty is a fascinating one. Like many such people that had the courage to resist the vile nazis,helping to get Jews and POW's out of occupied Italy  in 1943-4.,it is a story that needed to be told. And is acted with great aplomb by my all time favourite US actor Gregory Peck. Throw in the equally superb Christopher Plummer as Gestapo chief Herbert Kappler. And you have a real humdinger.

And to think it is all based on real events. As an aside,Kappler was saved from the hangmans rope by the timely intervention of Monsignor O'Flaherty and was commuted to a life sentence. Interestingly enough,O'Flaherty baptised Kappler into the Roman Catholic faith in 1959.

It is an old cliche,but this film is about the triumph of the human spirit,and the power of faith over the obscenity that was nazism.",1509062400,,827,4.769230769230769

1849500,1,B00008J2PG,"The Scarlet and the Black in itself is a movie well worth the purchase price as I remember it. However, this DVD recording (Feb 13, 2007) was worse than some of my old VCR recordings.

1849514,4,B00008J2PG,"I have a personal connection to the story, so I found it quite appealing and Gregory Peck's role in it very satisfying.  I do however feel that Christopher Plummer was miscast in the role of the German Commander.  I've read one of the books written on Monsignor O'Flaherty's exploits and I also have insight from my mother who knew O'Flaherty in Rome.  The movie was a made for TV drama that briefly glosses over all that was taking place prior to the allies actually liberating Rome.  I would have liked to see a more in depth retelling of the actual events.  I believe that it was a great story of a very pivotal historic moment during WWII and therefore give it 4 stars.",1494806400,,673,4.439024390243903
1849515,5,B00008J2PG,"A little background for this extraordinary film. The book is called, ""The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican,"" a reference to the Baroness Orzy book and the 1934 Leslie Howard film. The original Scarlet Pimpernel is set during the French Revolution and our hero acts like a spoiled count but secretly disguises himself in order to help his friends, the French Aristocrats escape the guillotine. His ever-changing methods and inventive disguises enable him to help hundreds leave France and safely come to England, much to the frustration and dismay of the French soldiers and their leaders. This story with Gregory Peck is set in the Vatican and he is Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, a fiery Irishman who uses his strength and ingenuity mixed with his resolve and compassion to help shelter escaped allied prisoners during World War II from the Nazis who are occupying Rome. The actually raise money from wealthy sponsors who support their cause, and rent apartments all through the city of Rome in which they secretly shelter thousands of escaped allies. Christopher Plummer is the Nazi Commander which he drives slowly crazy, because Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty and his team have the Lord on their side and their genius enables them to constantly be one step ahead of the military might of the arrogant illegitimate despot. This is a true story. It's great value lies in the wrestling of action versus inaction--and the thought process that goes into deciding what it is that we need to stand up for-- and what are the ramifications for our lives and the lives of others, if we don't. The Scarlet and the Black is a very thoughtful movie that will inspire you to stand up against evil--but not fight evil on its own terms, using Force. There is a better way with the help of the Lord. There is a genius way of still getting around being captured by the enemy, resulting in Victory!",1493078400,,1874,4.841121495327103

1849517,5,B00008J2PG,"I just saw this last night on TBN & was totally captivated by it.  I had never heard of this before.  I will be now purchasing it for my library.  The acting was superb.  I did have ""trouble"" though watching Christoper Plummer in the role as the brutal Nazi officer after associating him so much with ""The Sound of Music"", which took place in the same era!  This is not a ""fault"" of any kind; just different to see him in such an opposing role, which he does portray very well, though.",1489968000,,485,4.228260869565218

1849537,5,B00008J2PG,I first saw this made for tv film when it was shown in 1983.  I have fond memories of watching it with my parents when in high school.  Gregory Peck and Christopher Plumber were terrific in their roles.  This is a true story of a priest in Italy who hid Jewish people and passed them to safe houses so they could gain their freedom form the Nazi regime.  It is adventurous with many clever disguises that the priest uses to fool the Nazis right under their noses.  It is a profound story that I would recommend everyone to view at least once in their lives.,1482624000,,557,4.266666666666667

The story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty is fascinating as is his interaction with Pope Pius XII.  These two men are largely unsung heroes of World War II involved in efforts to save the Jews from Nazi persecution.  Hopefully this movie will encourage more people to study the historical record and correct it.  Wouldn't it be fun if some young person who sees this movie is inspired to write a doctoral dissertation on a topic related to it!",1480204800,,640,4.578947368421052

It also demonstrates the quiet bravery of the Italians who, unable to attack their enemy, do what they can in rescuing and guiding to safety those pursued by the Abwehr and Gestapo.

The movie, touted as based on a true story, has superb acting from Gregory Peck as the protagonist, Monsignor Hugh O' Flaherty and Christopher Plumber as the antagonist German SS Colonel, Herbert Kappler.  As a frequent visitor to Rome many of he sites and streets in the film were familiar to me for the movie was shot on location.  The film illustrates the chess game that occurred between the Third Reich and the Vatican in which the Vatican through moral courage assisted and protected Romans, Jews, Arabs, POW s and even Germans.  This film is a testament to the Catholic Church's commitment to humanity during a time of barbarism.

1849669,5,B00008J2PG,"The Scarlet and the Black is a 1983 made-for-TV movie about a Vatican priest who hides allied fliers (and others) from the Nazis. It's based on the true story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty from the book which was originally titled The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican. Gregory Peck plays O'Flaherty and Christopher Plummer (of Sound of Music fame) plays Col. Kappler, the S.S. official who is out to stop him. The film does a wonderful job of showing how these two try to outwit each other.

This is a long movie (2 1/2 hours) and the music is a little wonky, but it's well worth it for the powerful story of heroism and undeserved grace. I would suggest renting rather than buying it since the ending can only be astounding once. Be forewarned. This is a heavy movie. Although mild by today's standards, there is some shooting, one brief torture scene and mild profanities (taking the Virgin Mary's name in vain, which I actually thought was quite funny coming from a priest).

1849690,5,B00008J2PG,"Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty was a priest and high-ranking official of the Vatican Curia who, along with an underground network he supervised, helped save the lives of thousands of refugees, Jews, and POW's from the Nazis when they occupied Rome from 1943-1944. O'Flaherty's heroism has been somewhat eclipsed, partly because history has shown much ambivalence and controversy towards the decisions of the Vatican's leader of the time, Pope Puis XII. Hugh O'Flaherty was one of the great heroes who fought against the Nazis, as important as any of the leaders of the Resistance in France. ""The Scarlet and the Black"" is a fitting portrayal and tribute to the man some called the ""Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican"". The film centers around how O'Flaherty undermined the Nazi occupation in Rome with deception, charisma, and even a little bit of wit, in order to save the lives of those labeled as enemies of the Reich.

The film is outstanding primarily because of the two leads, Gregory Peck as O'Flaherty and Christopher Plummer as his nemesis, Colonel Herbert Kappler, who was charged with ""maintaining order in the city"", which included the deportation of Italian Jews to slave and death camps. (Apparently, Hitler included Italian Jews in his ""final solution"".) Both actors play their parts with enough subtlety and deftness that we never feel the movie is trying to make an overt propaganda statement. Instead, the filmmakers allowed the setting and actors tell their story without pushing a message, allowing viewers to draw their own conclusions, which is, in the end, a far more compelling statement. O'Flaherty is not entirely idealized, as he comes off stubborn, quick-tempered, and self-righteous. Being of Irish decent, he does not hesitate to express his anti-British sentiments. In a similar vein, Colonel Kappler is not completely vilified. Even Kappler is allowed a few moments of tenderness, although he is determined to carry out his orders at all costs. He does rationalize the crimes he commits as simply following the will of the Fuhrer. One of the most striking scenes involves Kappler meeting his high command and explaining why his control of Rome is not complete, which shows the complexity of the Nazi high command and the enormous pressures on high-ranking officers. His superior tells him that he must report directly to Hitler.

The other aspect which should not be overlooked is the fine screenplay by David Butler, based on the book ""The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican"" by J.P. Gallagher. The film never lapses into clich or over-the-top sentimentality, but rather opts for depicting the circumstances as true to history as much as can be expected from a feature film. The film also leaves ambiguous the ""right or wrong"" of the decisions made by Pope Pius XII. While some have criticized him for not denouncing the Nazis categorically during the war, he, before he became pope when he still a Cardinal, helped pen ""Mit brennender Sorge"" (1937), the first document by an international organization denouncing the Nazi regime. In the 1940's, Pope Pius and the Vatican embraced a policy of strict neutrality. Some in Poland felt betrayed by the Papacy while others felt it was necessary in order to save the church when Nazis imprisoned many thousands of the clergy, including monks and nuns.

Overall, a thoroughly compelling World War II drama that tells a story of great heroism. Hopefully, this film helped remind the public about other acts of great import that were done by those with no pretense to greatness. Some of these people did what they did while wearing a priest's collar. As a footnote, the film imparts that when Colonel Kappler was a prisoner for war crimes after Rome's liberation from Nazi occupation, O'Flaherty visited him every month.",1433808000,,3785,5.081993569131833

1849737,3,B00008J2PG,"This is basically apologist history. Nobody other than a Catholic thinks that the Pope was anything but either spineless or outright cooperative. The only resentment from the Vatican was towards potential loss of sovereignty, as they were still reeling from the loss of the Papal States due to the kidnapping of a Jewish Child. Odd how these movies never touch on the racist Cardinal Faulhaber, another focus for revisionists. That there was a courageous Irish priest who went against the grain, that is heroic. So then why not a film about Raul Wallenberg? Is it because he was Protestant with a Jewish grandmother?

One bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch, but one good apple doesn't redeem all the rotten ones. As a MOVIE considering cinematography, acting and so forth, it is a well made movie. So three stars. But for anyone who knows the facts as they are, not as people would like them to be, there is a constant specter in the background that inhibits complete appreciation.",1424563200,,986,4.834319526627219

1849759,3,B00008J2PG,"""Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty...rescued some 6500 people in and around Vatican City during the German occupation of Rome....He created an elaborate underground Vatican-based network--working secretly with other religious, diplomats and ordinary civilians....Safe houses, food, clothing and needed documents were provided--despite the constant presence of murderous fascists and Nazis....His enduring witness reminds us that we are all children of God, subject to his demands, but wide open to his love and mercy"" (William Doino Jr., First Things, 11/11/13).

Beautifully filmed in Vatican City and Rome, this film relates the inspiring heroics of Msgr. O'Flaherty, but it evidences certain serious shortcomings.  As per Steven D. Greydanus of DecentFilms(dot)com, ""John Gielgud plays Pius XII, who is depicted sympathetically and is shown to be willing to stand up to the Nazis. In one scene he is depicted as having had second thoughts about his Concordat with the Nazi regime -- a portrayal the well-meaning filmmakers undoubtedly meant to put the Holy Father in the best possible light.""  In that invented conversation between O'Flaherty and Pope Pius XII, it struck me that the latter was more or less depicted as acknowledging calumnies leveled after his death and spoken ever more loudly.  Since the film was made in 1983,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbi-Dalin/dp/0895260344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbi Dalin</a>&nbsp;has written of ahistorical calumnies from writers, such as Garry Wills (Papal Sin, 2000), John Corwell (Hitler's Pope, 1999), and James Carroll (Constantine's Sword, 2000).

Five years ago, the following appeared in an Israeli news publication:
* ""Some things never go away....the wartime pope...has been accused of keeping silent during the Holocaust, of doing little or nothing to help the Jews, and even of collaborating with the Nazis. To what extent, if any, does the evidence back up these allegations, which have been repeated since the early 1960s?....
* ""On behalf of Pope Pius XI, Cardinal Pacelli [the future Pope Pius XII] drafted an encyclical, entitled 'Mit brennender Sorge' ('With Burning Anxiety'), that condemned Nazi doctrines and persecution of the Catholic Church. The encyclical was smuggled into Germany and read from Catholic pulpits on March 21, 1937. Although many Vatican critics today dismiss the encyclical as a light slap on the wrist, the Germans saw it as a security threat....Both Great Britain and France should have interpreted the document as a warning that they should not trust Adolf Hitler or try to appease him....
* ""Unlike many of the pope's latter-day detractors, the Nazis understood him very well. After studying Pius XII's 1942 Christmas message, the Reich Central Security Office concluded: 'In a manner never known before the pope has repudiated the National Socialist New European Order ... Here he is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.' (Pick up any book that criticizes Pius XII, and you won't find any mention of this important report.)
* ""In early 1940, the pope acted as an intermediary between a group of German generals who wanted to overthrow Hitler and the British government. Although the conspiracy never went forward, Pius XII kept in close contact with the German resistance and heard about two other plots against Hitler....
* ""Throughout the war, the pope's deputies frequently ordered the Vatican's diplomatic representatives in many Nazi-occupied and Axis countries to intervene on behalf of endangered Jews. Up until Pius XII's death in 1958, many Jewish organizations, newspapers and leaders lauded his efforts....
* ""The campaign against Pope Pius XII is doomed to failure because his detractors cannot sustain their main charges against him - that he was silent, pro-Nazi, and did little or nothing to help the Jews - with evidence. Perhaps only in a backward world such as ours would the one man who did more than any other wartime leader to help Jews and other Nazi victims, receive the greatest condemnation"" (Dmitri Cavalli, Haaretz.com, 1/22/10).

1849760,3,B00008J2PG,"I own this and it is desservedly praised for the acting and for the story, but it is immensely flawed in deciding to not show the Pope as equally courageous and somehow indifferent to Peck's character.
Those who want to be doubly inspired need to look at the newer movie with James Cromwell (""Babe"" and ""L.A. Confidential"") who stars in ""Pius XII, Under the Roman Sky"".
The NY Times would like nothing better than to reject their own headlines from those days when Jew after Jew came forward to praise the POpe.
Far from neutral and far from silent, he only kept his peace when Hitler would immediately kill people for every speech that Pius made in criticism of the persecution of the Jews by Hitler and Nazism. Pius could stir people enormously, but Hitler, furious at the treaty of neutrality he'd arranged before becoming Pope, punished Pius's bravery by killing innocents and rounding up fresh Jews off the streets.",1420675200,,920,4.75625

The story is historically presented but leaves out the actual revelations provided by the Jewish leaders and the many Jews that were cared for and assisted by not only the priest in this story but actually the Pope too.

Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer are superb as Protagonist and Antagonist, with Pope, John Gielgud / Geilgud, caught in the middle. OBTAIN and ENJOY!

I was proud that the priest was given one of the highest honors that's usually bestowed on military personnel!

I had heard many stories surrounding the goings on by the Pope and his clergy, during the Nazi invasion of Rome!

There are humorous parts where Fr. O'Flaherty is at his best as the ""Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican,"" and there are other parts that are tragic (the young priest who was beaten and killed for his participation in the cause).  In the end, when Kapler is sent to prison for his war crimes, it is O'Flaherty who visits him regularly--taking forgiveness to a whole new level.  It's not a movie you'll want to watch right before going to bed, but it will definitely find its place among your classics.  And of course, Gregory Peck is outstanding in the role of Fr.

The main Nazi part was played by Cristopher Plummer who initially played the roll of an arrogant Nazi sadist, and who was finally so impressed with the forgiving Christian nature of the Monsignor, that he became a Christian.

A very good wholesome movie with lots of adventure and mystery.  This priest is truly an inspiration for Catholics and non-Catholics alike.

The book by the same name about Monsignor O'Flaherty makes a good companion to the film to set the story straight.
Others have told it better so I'll close by saying, this is not a Christian or Catholic story, it's the story on one man's personal campaign against evil no matter the risk to himself.  Don't let any religious bias keep you from it.",1401580800,,560,4.480392156862745

1849889,5,B00008J2PG,"A tense story about the occupation of Rome during the Nazi terror during WWII.  The story highlights how Fr. O'Flaherty (Gregory Peck) managed to help hide many Catholics who were being terrorized by the Nazis during WWII.  The story is pretty much a cat and mouse hide and seek game of keeping the Nazis from gathering up and murdering Jews and Catholics during the Nazi occupation of Rome.

The true story of Monsignor O'Flaherty shows how brave and clever the priest was in wearing disguises to slip in and out of the Vatican walls in order to go about helping to save innocent people from being murdered by the Nazis.  Parts of the movie must have been made inside the Vatican itself.  There are beautiful paintings and art that can be seen in the background.  There is a section of the Vatican where the treasures are seen and talked about and Pope Pius XII (Sir John Gielgud) walks a few steps into that very private place and you can see paintings and art in the entrance.

In the end of the movie, Christopher Plummer and Gregory Peck have a conversation in the colleseum and that conversation allows for a very surprise ending.  Be sure to read the after thoughts at the end of the movie as all of the story is based on true events.",1397347200,,1241,4.484444444444445

I'm only giving it a three rating only because I think it glosses over much, much too lightly the controversies between the Vatican and the Holocaust. In the end, the story about redemption and forgiveness aside, the dialogue between Peck and the pope appears to be a half-baked effort to exonerate the Vatican from its complex reaction to the Jewish Holocaust. Even in this film, Peck is only helping Allied POWs not Rome's rather sizable Jewish population (though he does express sadness at the round-ups). As an exciting thriller, the movie is good.

1849913,5,B00008J2PG,"Even after all these years [since the movie was first released], I find The Scarlet and the Black a riveting watch. Based on the true life exploits of Monsignor O'Flaherty [compellingly portrayed by Gregory Peck], the story recounts the events that unfolded during the Nazi occupation of Rome, led by SS officer Herbert Kappler [a rather evil and calculated performance by Christopher Plummer]. Though the Vatican is neutral during the war, the Pope and his staff find it incredibly difficult to remain calm when the Nazis begin terrorizing Rome's inhabitants [both Jews and non-Jews] and even torture a priest of the Church.

Gregory Peck plays Monsignor O'Flaherty, a high-ranking and influential priest in the Vatican who actively helps escaped Allied POWs, Jewish refugees and anyone who is trying to flee the Nazis' reign of terror. As a man of the cloth, he helps all those who are in need, without reservations and one event in the movie [where he helps with gathering funds to 'ransom' the Jews of Rome] is particularly compelling. Based on real historical events, this active role played by the Monsignor is even more significant given the Catholic church's rather passive role during the Nazi reign of terror in Occupied Europe [as attested by historical accounts]. Placing himself in mortal danger, and under the scrutiny of the Gestapo [the Nazi Secret Police], Fr O'Flahery brazenly and cunningly carries out his heroic acts [at times under the very noses of the Nazis] and earns the wrath of SS Col Herbert Kappler, the Nazi in charge of Occupied Rome. Kappler as portrayed by Christopher Plummer is the epitome of Nazi cunning and totally without remorse, stooping to execute a priest, backing out of a verbal promise [assuring safety] to the Jewish community etc. Though he begins his 'reign' over Rome with much confidence, he loses his composure and self-assuredness as Fr O'Flaherty and company manage to get away from the Nazis time and time again.

The story is well-told, with compelling human drama and lots of action. The suspense is built-up from the beginning, and the climax of the movie - a showdown between Kappler and Fr O'Flaherty is absolutely mind-blowing. It addresses an important question: in the face of so much evil, can one, especially a man of the cloth, overcome his personal convictions and extend mercy, or is he, in the end, merely human?

Though the protagonist in this movie is a Catholic priest, there is no real focus on religion here and only minor religious references. This is quite a feat given that the movie is centered in Rome and the Vatican! A must-see for fans of WW II dramas, especially those who are keen on real-life dramas centering on the Nazi occupation of Europe. Highly recommended!",1391731200,,2749,4.9587852494577005
1849914,5,B00008J2PG,This movie I have watched over and over.  Always I am surprised with what was necessary for lives to be saved from the Nazi commander and yet the ending is such a delight and surprise rolled into one.  The Monseignor was quite a fellow.,1391558400,,236,4.340909090909091

1849916,5,B00008J2PG,"An exciting true story about a Vatican Priest [Gregory Peck] who aided WWII POWs that were being smuggled out of Italy and a Nazi Hard Nosed Officer [Christopher Plummer] who was determined to catch and arrest him. This is an exciting cat and mouse game between the Vatican and the Germans, which also involved Pope Pius XII.  The Germans were not permitted to cross a line painted on the ground which prohibited the Nazis enterance to the Vatican. The Priest [Peck] used several disguises to fool the Germans nn xave a lot of prisoners. I rated this story ""Five Stars"" because it was based on fact by a daring priest who risked his life to save many people. It also has a true surprise ending, which you will enjoy.

This movie was recommended to me by a friend, who saw it and loved it. Yes, I will watch it again because it is about two and a half hours of viewin what this amazing priest did to save many lived.

Entertainment well worth watching for the whole family.  Cinematography is not the greatest, however the story is superb and well acted by all.  For some reason this film is not easy to find anywhere and I was very glad to find it here on Amazon.",1386288000,,398,4.486111111111111
1849937,5,B00008J2PG,"My sister suggested I watch this movie.  It specifically shows that the Catholic Church was against the Nazi, and did whatever they could to assist the people.

This is a true classic.  Gregory Peck is superb and what a surprise to see Christopher Plummer in a role 180 degrees out from his role in The Sound of Music.  Is there a rating called 5 start plus?  It should have it.",1384819200,,389,4.408450704225352

Best of all it is a true story of the selfless efforts of one priest and his companions to help enemies of the Nazis to hide or to escape from Rome during WWII.  In doing this they risk their freedom and their lives.

This seems like a made-for-TV film, which I generally find to be of lesser quality.  But this one has A-listers Gregory Peck, Christopher Plummer, and Sir John Gielgud.  It's long at almost 2.5 hours but is definitely worth your time.",1383177600,,521,4.442105263157894

I am not a  Catholic, but I married into an Irish family and Peck's character is certainly believable and well done.  Being taken from a true story, the movie is almost a documentary but the director made sure to keep it a very human drama rather than a historical adventure.

I was a 9-year-old in California following WWII in detail at the time of these happenings.",1381017600,,512,4.404255319148936

This is about the Vatican priest who protected and moved out of harm's way refugees from Hitler's grasp.  I am a huge fan of Christopher Plummer, who plays the relentless villain, until he becomes the hunted.  There are seens inside the Vatican of interest to me, and John Geigud was well cast as the Pope.  The acting was wonderfully pitted between the principles.

It's based on a true story, and, as of August 21, 2013, one of the real players in this saga of Rome 1943 is still alive. But I strongly recommend you watch the movie first and then check everybody's Wiki Page. Otherwise, you'll lose some of the thrill and awe ;)

The priest portrayed in the movie was a hero to many and forgave his arch enemy which isn't easy to do.  I wanted to view  the movie because I read the novel Hide and Seek, based on O'Flaherty's life.

I was a little surprised they didn't give the Pope more credit for saving lives. He actually gave much of the Vatican as a hiding place for Jews and others avoiding the Nazi- yet his reputation after the war was unfairly put down. This movie misses the chance to clear his name and it only has one hero the Priest. Still deserves a 5 star for over all film - an interesting, well done movie.",1372118400,,565,4.192660550458716

Plummer playing a Nazi General and Peck playing an Irish monsenior in Rome. Peck who plays a priest smuggling out POWs and Jews from Italy during WWII, while Plummer is constantly on his case to find evidence he is doing so.  The movie has a great cat and mouse action between the two.  My only complaint was the movie was a bit LONG and yet the directors continued to up the ante as to how to get Peck out of trouble.

Wrong SS insignia was distracting-- no `SS` on right collar.

Also distracting from the story: German soldiers in new Hollywood uniforms jumping out of trucks every 10 minutes and running around. The one-dimensional Hollywood portrayal of every German was distracting. It all screams ""Made for TV.""

Worst scene: Firing squad, Italian Army platoon. They fire wide, not wanting to kill the priest. Then SS Lt Col Kappler orders them to do their job. The Italian lieutenant pulls out his Beretta, locks and loads, aims at the priest, but doesn`t fire. Then Kappler pulls his own pistol, pushes aside the impotent Italian, and shoots the priest.

I was not there; I cannot say what I would have done had I been there, but I am pretty sure that were I in the shoes of the Italian lieutenant, I would have called my men to present arms, load, and aim, and then, with the guns of the platoon pointing nearly at the SS officers, I would have shot SS Lt Col Kappler.

This is a super great movie, and Greg Peck and Sir John Gilguid (as Pope) very terrific in their roles.  Also, the thin Italian Cardinal or whoever he was, Really ticked me off with his attitude, but it was as it Should have Been!  Ha.  In any event, this is next in place as a favorite of mine to the Shoes of the Fisherman, Shoes being best in my opinion, but this one next.  Especially great were the plots where the Irish Priest (Peck) outwitted the German Gestapo.  All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It certainly carries a potent message.

1850012,5,B00008J2PG,"This film, set in Nazi-occupied Rome during World War II, depicts the efforts of a remarkable member of the Vatican staff, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, and, to a lesser extent, sheds some much needed light on the actions of the Pope during that war.  It would be a great film even if it weren't true, but, in this case, it is just that.  Gregory Peck portrays Monsignor O'Flaherty; Christopher Plummer, Colonel Kappler, the Gestapo Chief in Rome; and Gielgud, Pope Pius XII.

In has long been Catholic policy to give sanctuary to those in eminent danger, and such was the case in Italy and in Nazi-occupied Rome during WWII.  The Vatican State was, of course, in a precarious position; surrounded by the Nazis it could offer no resistance if Hitler decided to invade.  The Pope, then, had to walk a fine line of neutrality; while, at the same time, hundreds of escaped British soldiers and downed-American and Allied airmen, along with hundreds of Jews and various other resistance fighters and refugees, were attempting to evade capture in hopes of gaining Vatican sanctuary.

The plot of this film, then, revolves around Monsignor O'Flaherty's attempts to finance, organize, and maintain a secret group dedicated to finding safe havens for these hunted men while, at the same time, the Gestapo was doing everything in its power to root them out and punish those who sheltered them.  This makes for a very compelling film well worth watching.

Some points of interest: At war's end, it was estimated that at the time of Rome's liberation O'Flaherty and his confederates were hiding over 6,500 people.  For his efforts, Monsignor O'Flaherty was subsequently made a `Commander of the British Empire' and was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the United States.

1850038,5,B00008J2PG,"IMPORTANT! 1st things 1st:
The product worked upon introducing it in the DVD player! Hooray!

Good thing it came in good condition, because that hasn't always been the case, UNFORTUNATELY!
Even more tragic is that I had purchased a Xmas DVD in July (-back in 2010. Case in point: ""The Gathering"").

I advise all of you: NEVER plan ahead for Xmas in the dead of summer* while shopping on one of these sites (it's as if they picked damaged-goods to be sold as ""seasonal"" items which they KNOW FULL WELL no one's going to open until whatever the season -Xmas, for example. Just a friendly warning...

...But go ahead and read my recommendation of THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK right below:

Years after its TV broadcast, I'm so glad to watch this GEM once more!

I bought the DVD in 2010, looking for a special present for my husband, who had missed out on all those Great TV Series.

The Scarlet and The Black is #1 on the venerable list of ""Greatest TV Series of ALL TIME"".

What's more, it was produced during the last of the Golden Era of Hollywood, featuring the last... the ULTIMATE of true professionals: actors who were REAL LUMINARIES of the screen.

I won't spoil it any more than I have to, but may I point out the leading men, gifted masters-of-their-craft: GREGORY PECK and CHRISTOFER PLUMMER?

Thank You! Good Night!

*Needless to say, after that December-Disappointment, I haven't come back to shop since 2010. Just visiting, and Am a little bitter.",1341964800,,1457,4.634241245136187
1850039,4,B00008J2PG,"You'll have heard of Monsignor O'Flaherty of course.  No? Well, whisper here now 'till I tell you.  He was real and not one of them ""Barry Fitzgerald"" made-up priests.  He was called ""The Vatican Pimpernel"" because he managed to save over six thousand Jews and escaped allied POW's from the Nazi sharks during the second world war.  Gregory Peck plays him in THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, a made-for-TV mini-series in 1983.  Now the mini-series has been put together into one.  By the way, the title, THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, comes from two sources:  a monsignor was entitled to wear a scarlet band at the waist of his black robe, and and as you'll recall surely, they were the same colours as those of the Nazi flag.

Now our own Christopher Plummer - a darlin' fellow - plays the nasty Nazi who has a white line painted across St. Peter's Square to mark the boundary of the Vatican State.  Now with Plummer on one side and Peck on the other, why you can see that the battle is drawn.  And by the by, Plummer gives a strong performance as SS-Obergruppenfuhrer,(don't worry now if you can't pronouce it, the war is over), and not one of his show-offy turns as he  did at other times.  The same is true of Gregory Peck, seen here in his later - and better - years.

THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK has great shots of Rome and the Vatican, and the story is suspensefully told - lots of scary parts - with the duel to the death between between the priest and the Nazi its centrepiece.

The cast of THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK is strong - watch for the fine Italian actor, Raf Vallone, always worth watching, and of course in those days you couldn't have Pope Pius XII in your movie unless you had John Geilgud (now Sir John I'll have you know).

THE SCARLETT AND THE BLACK also has a nice surprise waiting for you at the end.  It's an important history lesson that goes down well.

It may not have had as much hype as SL but as memories of WWII fade with the passing years, this film reminds us of the multiple acts of bravery performed by so many ""average"" people during that time. A brave Irish priest led the activities to shelter thousands of refugees during the German occupation. However, many local Italians and ex-patriates also risked their lives - all because they believed in human freedom and helping their fellow man. This film also presents the politics that involved the Papacy. Pope Pius XII has gotten so much flack for not being more ""anti-Nazi"". Sir John Gielgud did a phenomenal job in depicting the neutrality that had to be presented publicly while allowing aid to be done under his own roof. During our current era, when greed and violence seem to dominate, this film is a refreshing reminder that each of us can be heroic. A final unexpected twist and the epilogue show the extent of Fr.

His compassion for the Italian people and his conviction that his personal danger was immaterial to the task at hand is uplifting!  A lesson in personal courage and belief in moral values, if ever I saw one.  Also, that the Msgrs. part was played by one of Hollywoods most iconic leading men didn't hurt either!  Gregory Peck is, was and will always be an actor whose pictures stand apart and above other lesser mortals.  A true measure of an actors' skill is immersion in a part so that the viewer actually believes he/she is seeing the person being portrayed, not someone acting a part!  Peck makes you believe it, every time!  Lastly, the fact that the good Msgr. was an Irishman didn't hurt either!

I feel that this is Gregory Peck's best role and Christopher Plummer plays a great evil nemesis. One might question the choice of John Gielgud playing Pope Pius the XII however. Which brings me to the major flaw in this made for television movie. The portrayal of Pope Pius as, ""aloof"" (as it states on the back of the box) and having him pressure Monsignor O'Flaherty to stop helping Allied POWs in order to protect the Church, is just plain ludicris. Pope Pius ordered Catholic clergy to help save the lives of Jews which would have had his priests and nuns doing the exact same thing that Monsignor O'Flaherty was doing. Rabbi David G.

Of course, at the time screenwriter David Butler was flushing out the storyline for his screenplay, Pope Pius XII's reputation had already been destroyed. In 1963 the KGB propaganda machine was behind Rolf Hochhuth's play entitled The Deputy which engineered a false history for Pius and his actions. Although fiction, Pope Pius' reputation was destroyed by one negative biography after another. Despite books by Rabbi Dalin and Joseph L.

This is not a catholic film. This is Schindler's List on the streets of Rome. This is courage feeding on courage. This is people doing the right thing at great risk.

1850070,5,B00008J2PG,"This movie gives an overview of the important and dangerous work that Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty took upon himself during the German Occupation of Rome during World War II. The monsignor, portrayed outstandingly by Gregory Peck, devotes his ingenuity, contacts and time to hiding refugees and escaped allied prisoners of war (POWs). The underground network he built using religious houses, neutral embassies and the local residents was instrumental in assisting keeping thousands of people alive.

His nemesis was the Gestapo Colonel Kapple who is played impeccably by Christopher Plummer. Even though the monsignor had diplomatic immunity the pressures brought to bear on the Colonel demanded he stop all underground activity and gives orders to kill the monsignor on sight when ever he was found outside of the Vatican grounds.

`The Scarlet and the Black' shows us this historical story with a flow of non-stop suspense and excitement. History is brought alive in such a way that you wish to continue to learn more. As an extra bonus the film is filmed on location in Rome where this game of life and death was played out. There is no question that the monsignor deserved the awards the various countries awarded him, but even more important you see that even with all that he lived through and witnessed he lived the Catholic principles he espoused.

The acting by Peck and  Christopher Plummer as SS Col. Herbert Kapler, is first rate and the script is quite good for the most part.

1850081,5,B00008J2PG,"Even after all these years [since the movie was first released], I find The Scarlet and the Black a riveting watch. Based on the true life exploits of Monsignor O'Flaherty [compellingly portrayed by Gregory Peck], the story recounts the events that unfolded during the Nazi occupation of Rome, led by SS officer Herbert Kappler [a rather evil and calculated performance by Christopher Plummer]. Though the Vatican is neutral during the war, the Pope and his staff find it incredibly difficult to remain calm when the Nazis begin terrorizing Rome's inhabitants [both Jews and non-Jews] and even torture a priest of the Church.

Gregory Peck plays Monsignor O'Flaherty, a high-ranking and influential priest in the Vatican who actively helps escaped Allied POWs, Jewish refugees and anyone who is trying to flee the Nazis' reign of terror. As a man of the cloth, he helps all those who are in need, without reservations and one event in the movie [where he helps with gathering funds to 'ransom' the Jews of Rome] is particularly compelling. Based on real historical events, this active role played by the Monsignor is even more significant given the Catholic church's rather passive role during the Nazi reign of terror in Occupied Europe [as attested by historical accounts]. Placing himself in mortal danger, and under the scrutiny of the Gestapo [the Nazi Secret Police], Fr O'Flahery brazenly and cunningly carries out his heroic acts [at times under the very noses of the Nazis] and earns the wrath of SS Col Herbert Kappler, the Nazi in charge of Occupied Rome. Kappler as portrayed by Christopher Plummer is the epitome of Nazi cunning and totally without remorse, stooping to execute a priest, backing out of a verbal promise [assuring safety] to the Jewish community etc. Though he begins his 'reign' over Rome with much confidence, he loses his composure and self-assuredness as Fr O'Flaherty and company manage to get away from the Nazis time and time again.

The story is well-told, with compelling human drama and lots of action. The suspense is built-up from the beginning, and the climax of the movie - a showdown between Kappler and Fr O'Flaherty is absolutely mind-blowing. It addresses an important question: in the face of so much evil, can one, especially a man of the cloth, overcome his personal convictions and extend mercy, or is he, in the end, merely human?

Though the protagonist in this movie is a Catholic priest, there is no real focus on religion here and only minor religious references. This is quite a feat given that the movie is centered in Rome and the Vatican! A must-see for fans of WW II dramas, especially those who are keen on real-life dramas centering on the Nazi occupation of Europe. Highly recommended!",1229126400,,2749,4.9587852494577005

There were may stellar moments, some tense others more light-hearted as the church struggled to provide refuge against the strangle-hold of the forces of evil.  The acting by Peck was wonderful but what became a little tiring were the numerous 'disguises' the priest assumed in order to escape the bonds of his Vatican prison in order to meet with operatives outside the walls.  One wondered why a lesser known individual could not have done this task causing less attention to himself and danger to the mission.

Three of the main characters, played by Peck, Plummer and Guilegud, each driven by his interpretation of ""duty"", weave a complex and credible tapestry of the beauty and complexity of being human.

This award-winning film is an often overlooked cinematic gem, recounting how ordinary people can achieve extraordinary outcomes, when a charismatic individual, Peck's character Mgr. O'Flaherty, provides the vision and leadership. Mgr. O'Flaherty's Jesuit training and Catholic clergy's penchant for dressing up both serve him well in his endeavours.

This movie predates other more widely acclaimed productions in the war-movie / drama genre (e.g. Schindler's List, Michael Collins) and is in my view superior.

The truth is that he secretly instructed Catholic clergy to save lives by any means, and asked churches and convents throughout Italy to shelter Jews.  In Rome, 155 convents and monasteries sheltered some 5,000 Jews, 3,000 found refuge at one time at the Pope's summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, and hundreds lived within the walls of the Vatican.  One Jewish woman even gave birth in the Vatican.  If it weren't for that, I'd give the movie five stars - and I recommend it anyway.  Just ignore the absolutely lame portrayal of the Pope.

Kappler turns to Father O'Flaherty for help!  (This did in fact happen in reality--Fr. O'Flaherty routinely visited Col. Kappler when he was imprisoned and the SS colonel eventually became a devout Catholic, thanks in part to Fr. O'Flaherty's influence.)

1850108,5,B00008J2PG,"I'm Protestant ... and some may think this is only a movie for Catholics ... but this movie transcends 'religion'.  It is a movie for anyone facing adverse times and the difficult choices one must make (the choice between protecting self, or risking all for someone who cannot give anything in return).  Because of this, it has always been one of my favorites.

Based on a real events, is shows what one man can do, in the face of fear, uncertainty, hatred and unspeakable cruelty ... and demonstrates that one can face these things victoriously without being turned into the very thing you're resisting.

When you look at world events today ... you see that so often, hatred and cruelty is responded too by hatred and cruelty.  This movie is a powerful reminder that you do not have to turn into the very evil that is confronting you.  The footnote at the end of the movie is particularly significant ... because it shows the power of love and forgiveness.  It demonstrates in real life what it means to practice true Christian love.

Gregory Peck wonderfully portrays a man struggling with his natural hot temper and the call to humility.  He's a man of action and he shows that you can ALWAYS do something when confronted with evil.  He also struggles with matching his actions with the dictates of his faith ... and being sure that they do not contradict each other.  In his inner struggles, he always chooses to do for someone who can do nothing in return ... and chooses not to protect himself.

Christopher Plumber wonderfully portrays someone who has been indoctrinated with power of hate; and the desire to impress his superiors; and he shows the odd way someone can justify one's actions and yet be so loving to his family; and shows his hidden desire to believe that this world really isn't the cruel place he has found it to be ... and the wishful thinking that the teachings of Christianity COULD be true ... even when all the evidence he has seen in his life, tells him there is no truth in any of this.  It kind of reminds you of Pilates statement to Christ ... ""What is Truth?""  All his decisions in life center on protecting himself, and his family.  Not bad things in themselves.  But given the times he lived in, the choice between doing the right thing, and protecting self ... was the difference between death and life.  It was easier to 'go with the flow' than stand up for what was right.  Yet something in his conscience wanted to hold on to the hope that there was something better out there.

All in all ... a very powerful telling of how people face the difficult choices they are faced with in life.  Hard times always bring these things into greater focus.  In good times, it is easy to say you believe in things.  It is only under pressure, when you are faced with life and death choices, that you find out what you really believe.",1140825600,,2861,4.525291828793774
1850109,5,B00008J2PG,"This movie, based on the book by J. Gallagher entitled ""Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican"" describes in somewhat romantic detail the true story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, represented in this wonderful film by Gregory Peck. This is a World War II era based film, well written, concerning the Priest who is in reality a close associate of Pope Pius XII and the Holy Office of the Inquisition. The Monsignor and his Italian associates hide escaping POW's who sought sanctuary at the Vatican once they had escaped unguarded Italian POW camps at the time of the Italian surrender and German occupation of Rome. O'Flaherty took considerable personal risk and became the object of Gestapo hunts and demands for arrest. He is shown going in and out of the Vatican in disguises as a postman, a trinket salesman, a nun, a street sweeper and even a Nazi Officer!  Christopher Plummer plays a Nazi Colonel who becomes obsessed with capturing the Priest, his ring and the secret havens for hiding POWS that O'Flaherty has in motion. In this role he does very well, although his hair seems a bit long for Nazi military men of that era. The screenplay is gripping, tense, exciting, and above all entertaining because it is true. Honestly, I can't understand how this was ignored or perhaps it is indicative of bias on behalf of film award councils because it concerns a true righteous gentile who aided Jews in WW 2 and was responsible for the lives of perhaps 7,000 allied and Italian people wanted by the Nazi regime. The film is a bit long but is worth every minute. An excellent drama!",1111622400,,1576,4.751824817518248
1850110,4,B00008J2PG,"This movie, albeit long, does a lot to help people question the popularly held view that the Catholic Church sat out the war and did nothing to help Jews in danger. Certainly, Msgr. O'Flaherty is a Righteous Gentile in all senses of the word 'righteous'. Regarding Pius XII, the scurrilous accusations against him seem to stem from a stageplay from the early 1960's. How an accusation from an piece of fiction can become 'gospel truth', so to speak, is no surprise. Look what it did for Catherine the Great--whoa, boy! As to Mr. Peck's accent, I find it amusing that he is criticized in other reviews. Amused, because Gregory Peck's parents were Irish-born folk who emigrated to America, settling in southern California. He grew up with Irish accents all around him. His is a soft brogue. Maybe what people are expecting is that overdone 'wee' leprechaun schtick that usually passes for an Irish accent.",1109635200,,903,4.87012987012987
1850111,4,B00008J2PG,"""All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."" So Msr. O'Flaherty and co. do something.  This story, which I am astonished to be learning for the first time (my father, being Irish, Catholic and in WWII should have been bragging of this all my life) is one of the best I have ever heard or read.  What a ripping yarn, and it's not only true but from background reading even better than what's in the movie.  There are no words for the completely redemptive, God-glorifying quality of this tale and even the movie.  But, and it's a small but - I don't care if Peck has a passing weak Irish accent.  To be accurate, Gielgud would be speaking Italian and Plummer German, so put that out of your mind completely. Its small failings are - it is too long.  (2 1/2 hours)  It is worth the time, but things that could be told really well have not been, you can sense it from what you see - and other things are lingered over that could be cut effectively.  Maybe I am looking for Hollywood""drama"" and this is more realistic, I'm not sure. I've sat through all 3 Lord of the Rings (also too long)and doubt I would rewatch them.  This is one I'd watch several more times, and it would be more watchable if it were a half hour shorter.  As far as rating and younger children - if they have reached the age to learn anything about the war, I don't think you could do better than letting them see there were people fighting that evil who didn't carry guns.",1106352000,,1470,4.255395683453237
1850112,5,B00008J2PG,"This factual and dramatic film is one of the many rebuttals to salacious charges made over the last 40 years that the Papacy did nothing to help the Jews against Nazi tyranny in World War II.  Nothing could be more from the truth !  His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, was relentless in his determination to thwart the Hitler-Mussolini terrorization and murder of millions of Jews, Catholics and other Cristian groups.  The vicious attacks by ignorant anti Catholic writers and critics have gone on for years but papers, reports and eye witness accounts over the same period, most notably the last several years, have totally demolished the false and bigoted charges made against Pius XII.  The Catholic Church, notably the newly elected Pope, Pius XII in 1938, did more to hide and disguise Jews and move them into convents, churches and ultimately out of Gemany and Italy to safety in allied countries than any other single organization.  These heroic deeds were recognized by the Head Rabbi Zolli of Rome so much so that he became a convert to Catholicism, taking the Christian name of Eugene after Eugenio Pacelli, the full name of Pius XII.  Years later, none other than Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir also praised the valiant efforts of Pius XII in her official thanks for saving thousands of Jewish lives.

  This film, THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, focuses on one of many heroes of the Holocaust, Monsignor Flaherty, brilliantly protrayed by Gregory Peck with a supporting cast of eminent actors and actresses including Christopher Plummer, John Gielgud and Raf Valone.

Although the Pope, as portrayed by Gielgud, insists on the fact of neutrality to the Nazi regime and at times appears passive, in actuality, the real Pope Pius XII, was a master of his own war of words with Hitler, so much so that the Vatican was never harmed due to the world wide indignation over jsut the thought of a military reprisal by Hitler.  This movie should be a mandaatory part of any history class dealing with WWII.  It is simply excellent !

What a tribute to the Church!  The pro-Catholic view of the movie is not at the expense of Protestantism, so I don't think Protestants would be offended in any way.  I think that all Christians can love this movie for what it is a movie of a historical event that is uplifting as can be.  Another triumph of love and goodness.

Christopher Plummer plays the SS colonel who ""owns"" Rome (an interesting contrast with his role as Baron von Trapp in The Sound of Music). Peck stays on his toes, continuously exploring ways of outwitting the growing Nazi oppression.
Although not overtly religious--well, it's hard to set a story in the Vatican without being religious! While the movie doesn't explore spirituality in depth (nor does it seek to proselytize), it does paint several ethical dilemmas.
A powerful story, one I'd like to see on DVD, with background material. Worthy of a documentary as well. Almost hard to believe that a movie about a Jesuit member of the Holy Order (ie the Inquisition) could be this riveting. It is.

Peck, as O'Flaherty, masters the protrayal of the Irish monsignor. Plummer, who portrays the Nazi colonel sent to head the Gestapo in Rome, adds passion and vibrance to the screen. As Colonel Herbert Kappler of the SS, Plummer takes the viewers into a realm of unspeakable cruelty, violence, and zeal, qualities worthy of the harsh Nazis.

""Hitler's Pope"" by Cornwall IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!).

1850127,5,B00008J2PG,"You'd never think an action movie could star a priest, but Gregory Peck  pulls it off in rare style. He plays Father O'Flaherty, a boxing, snipping  Irish priest living in Rome at the height of the Nazi occupation. Father  O'Flaherty's job? Aside from usual priestly duties, he hides Jews in the  households of his friends and allies.
But clearly the Nazis aren't going  to stand still while O'Flaherty does this. And so the Nazi commandant,  Christopher Plummer's Herbert Kapplar, a cold and ruthless man whose  reputation is rapidly going down the drain from his exalted position as he  tries to capture O'Flaherty.
But don't think this is a bloodless drama  movie: There are comic moments as O'Flaherty sneaks out of the Vatican in  various disguises; a tense scene where guns fire at him as he hurdles back  into the Vatican disguised as a Nazi officer; and at the end there's a  beautiful scene for those of you who like love-filled, happy endings. Even  though there is a number of mentions of Catholiscism and God, I believe  this is a drama/war movie at its core, not a religious one.
This is a  moving story about oppression and redemption. Even though you'll hate  Kapplar for his Nazi position, he's not a cookie-cutter villain: We can see  how he loves his wife and children. And O'Flaherty is no goody-goody  priest: we see him lose his temper, as well as refuse a plea for help  (although he later does it anyway). The characters are solidly  human.
Olga Karlatos is excellent as a widow from Malta who is sort of  O'Flaherty's sidekick. And Sir John Gielgud has a relatively brief but very  important role as Pius XII, a man who has to walk a hideous  tightrope--giving O'Flaherty leave to hide as many Jews as possible, while  concealing this from the Nazis, who would overrun the Vatican if they found  out. (Bravo, Pius XII)
A warning: Though this film is ""Not  Rated"" it's not a kiddie flick. People are shot violently, Nazis  attempt to stab O'Flaherty at one point, Nazis overrun people's homes and  hunt Jews down, a priest is beaten to death and eventually dies, and there  are some disturbing close-ups of bruised faces and a darning needle stuck  into a person's hand.

I am not a Catholic, but it is enheartening to hear a story of a Catholic priest who was living for Christ.  This movie is well written, directed, and produced, and carries the  timeless Christian messages of treating others the way you would want to be treated,  esteeming others better than yourself, laying down your life that others might live, and that one doesn't have to be perfect for the life and love of Christ to shine through their life and actions.",1518220800,,960,4.6117647058823525

Hot Toasty Rag, January 21, 2018

As it is, this tv movie is two and a half hours, but it could have easily been stretched out and doubled its running time. The Scarlet and the Black is such a fascinating story, and its also based on a true one. The end of the movie is not the end of the true story, and if you look up the facts afterwards, youll wish the movie continued documenting the remaining decades of what happened! But no spoilers here, don't worry.

Bless his heart, but Gregory Peck just cant do accents. He plays an Irish priest, but youll just have to forgive him his terrible attempt at an Irish accent; if you dont, you might not make it through the movie. Everything else in the film is fantastic, though, so I recommend you forgive him. His character is an active participant in the Italian Resistance in Nazi-occupied Rome. He smuggles refugees and prisoners of war out, but since hes such a big-wig in the religious community, Christopher Plummer, a big-wig in the Nazi community, cant arrest him. The film shows their struggle to outsmart each other, and the risks Greg takes to save lives, even when risking his own.

My favorite scene in the film is so tense, I found myself actually nibbling on my fingernail until the scene was over. Christopher Plummer has threatened Gregory Peck with arrest should he cross a painted line on the street outside the Vatican. Chris stands in a neighboring window, watching, as Greg approaches the line. He aims a gun at Greg, and as Greg looks up and sees his nemesis, he maintains his eye contact as he paces back and forth parallel to the line, occasionally swinging his leg over the line to call Chriss bluff. Its a fantastic scene and a perfect representation of the rest of the film.

Both leadsdespite Gregs lack of accentare wonderful. Up until recently, I haven't appreciated Christopher Plummers acting talents, and this is one of the movies that helped me cross over. Hes really wonderful in the role, extremely averse but somewhat amused and even admiring of Gregs tenacity, and strict but fearful for his family. I keep waiting for a remake of this movie, starring Tom Hanks and Christoph Waltz. Even if the remake started when this movie ended, there would be plenty of fascinating material to create an irresistible film. Until Hollywood decides to make a modern reboot, watch the original. Its really very good, and you can see a very handsome Christopher Plummer in his prime.",1516492800,,2487,4.671232876712328
