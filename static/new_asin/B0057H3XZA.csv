They were two worlds and times apart but had the same destination and tenacity to get there! Ack Attack had more money and horsepower but wanted to go twice as fast so I think this requires about four times the effort! This DVD does a most excellent job of capturing that spirit and effort with a much bigger dash of realism and a down to the wire photo finish! Next best thing to being there! Thanks for the chronicle!",1319155200,2,530,4.31
8460710,5,B0057H3XZA,"""Its hard to do"" says a Bonneville veteran in this film, talking about breaking the two-wheel land speed record. Well that is quite an understatement, when you see the challenges the team is up against with a ticking clock. This film has stunning photography of man and machine pitted against natural forces, cool graphics showing how the aerodynamics work on a streamliner and solid technical information, delivered in an easy to understand way, about how a bike is geared and tuned at this level. It's engineering heaven. It is also an incredibly gripping film with a cast of real life characters who push themselves and each other beyond and then beyond that. There is raw emotion as we see holding it together under the most extreme challenges. Rocky Robinson a man of unbelievable courage trying to go 400 mph and Mike Akatiff, who designed and built the machine with his `can do/must do' gritty determination both face setback after setback with mechanical problems and waiting for the weather conditions to be perfect before they lose their slot on the flats. `Salt gremlins' is what the Bonneville regulars call them. Anything that can go wrong does and it builds a nail-biting tension that is as gripping to watch as any feature film drama. If you like bikes, if you like speed, if you like engineering, if you like extreme challenges and if you like a great story  - then you'll love Ack Attack.",1311552000,4,1405,4.805785123966942
