8016714,5,B0001VTPV8,"What a premise! Hitman has to decide whether or not to kill a toddler who may be able to finger him for a murder, while falling in love with the toddler's mother. Yes, it sounds ludicrous, and it is, but in Larry's hands it's a story filled with heart and humor and suspense. The 'ET' monologue may be one of the greatest pieces of dialogue ever written. I love all of Larry's films but this one stood out. It's ripe for reappraisal!",1521244800,,433,4.2926829268292686
8016715,1,B0001VTPV8,"Where most films merely come out disjointed and dull when they don't work, Cohens film is a tone-deaf mixture of genre clichs that is staggeringly awful in a way that makes it impossible to look away.

8016716,1,B0001VTPV8,"Perfect Strangers, (1984).  In this 92-minute crime thriller, mob-connected hit man Johnny (Brad Rijn, SPECIAL EFFECTS), on one of his contracts, chases an opposition man into a scenic  alley, where he knifes him to death, then apologizes to him.  He almost immediately realizes he's got a witness, a three-year old one.  He shares his problem with his Mafia employers, who order him to whack the child.  But to do that, he'll first have to get past the boy's mother, Sally (Anne Carlisle, LIQUID SKY), whom he starts to find irresistible - and he starts to love the boy, too.  He must figure out where his deepest sympathies lie.  This low-budget indie suspenser was written and directed by Larry Cohen, an experienced hand with a low-budget horror film, such as ITS ALIVE; THE WINGED SERPENT, GOD TOLD ME TO, THE STUFF.

The movie, which proclaims itself to be an urban noir, is supposedly set in New York City, though we rarely see the actors interacting with that particular  urban landscape.  To make it look more New Yorky, stock shots of that great city might simply have been inserted in the film, that's what it looks like to me.  While the movie might have been shot anywhere but New York.  I'm a native New Yorker, born and bred, and it sure didn't look or feel like that city to me.  The film also doesn't move to that quick New York pace, unfortunately, it's rather slow, with action only at beginning and end; mostly it's just boring.

Furthermore, the cast do not look or sound like New Yorkers.  And they turn in terrible performances.  It's hard to decide who's worst, but I think the women are marginally worse than the men.  Except the male principals really do not send out testosterone-driven vibes.  So  I'd have to go with 3-year old Matthew Stockley, playing the child Matthew, as the picture's best actor.  I'm not aware that any of the cast have had much further careers after the making of this, but, even if one of them did, simply  changed his/her stage name, I doubt that I could recognize him or her, they are wearing such humongous 1980s hair here, whether their own or poorly-fitted hairpieces.

In one of principal actor Johnny's scenes, he parades down NY's Broadway, the theater district, wearing a red shirt similar to that worn by John Travolta, as Tony Manero, parading down Brooklyn's 86th Street.  I suppose it was meant as a homage to that marvelous scene from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.  Or possibly the director hoped to go the original one better.  But Travolta's scene is one of the most joyful moments in movies to many of us; right up there with Meryl Streep's bursting into song with ""Dancing Queen"" in MAMMA MIA. Or Steve McQueen's motorcycle ride in THE GREAT ESCAPE, his careening drive through San Francisco in BULLITT.  Johnny's little parade down Broadway?  No feeling whatever.  Nada.  Zilch.  Or bupkis, as we would say in New York.  We might also say drek in New York.",1378512000,2,2921,4.702169625246548
8016717,1,B0001VTPV8,"I'm a big Larry Cohen fan. His quirky horror movies have been a reliable source of entertainment for quite a while. Classics such as IT'S ALIVE 1-3, Q: THE WINGED SERPENT, GOD TOLD ME TO, and THE STUFF are masterpieces of low-budget film-making. So, I just knew that his foray into suspense called PERFECT STRANGERS would be a hit. Unfortunately, I sat through the entire thing only to stare wide-eyed while the credits rolled. Not due to any jaw-dropping entertainment, but because I'd just witnessed a mega-dud of massive proportions! This movie was extremely boring. I'm talking no-reason-left-to-live boring! Plot: A child witnesses a murder, causing the killer to get close to the kid's mum in order to get to junior. This sounds great. It ain't. All of the ""action"" is at the very beginning and the last five minutes. Everything in between is senseless prattling and useless movement. I wish it had been different. Oh well, I'll re-watch the rest of Mr. Cohen's offerings and ignore this one's existence...",1264723200,7,1012,4.958823529411765
