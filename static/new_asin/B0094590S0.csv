5257037,3,B0094590S0,"Not bad. Nothing too original however but entertaining none the less. Two sisters and their random friends they find along the way are captured but a crazed, post apocalyptic family. Movie is originally in German and dubbed over fairly well in English. FYI, this movies is available under the title ""Apocalypse"" at Walmart.",1345507200,3,323,5.113207547169812
5257038,4,B0094590S0,"this german film is a very well end of the world movie. the acting is good and the story which is basically a car full of people try to get to where water is  in the mountains are ambushed by evil people is worth your time. The world is dying from solar flares and a ten degree increase in temperature. Which happened before and killed 96% of all life on the planet. (225 million years ago). If it increases just a few more , we will be headed into a hell for sure , but this version of hell takes place mainly in the hills. In spite of the lack of funds this is not a bad movie in the slightest. The situations seem rugged and real. This is not a shlock movie with bad dialogue or dumb situations either. By the time this movie begins most people are already dead , and you as the world is blasted by the sun , you don't see much but a few dead cows. But it deosn't matter because this could happen and is happening slowly as the carbon levels rise. This  one moves quickly and has english subtitles. The film has the feel of a much higher budget movie too. I like shlcoky movies but this is far from that and should please sci fi fans in spite of the budget. After all the excellent movie 'the road' rarely features much ruins or things like that. This is similiar to that movie in some ways.",1357862400,,1294,4.090551181102362
5257039,4,B0094590S0,"Hell follows a group of survivors as they try to find water and other resources in post-apocalyptic Germany, which has been affected by solar flares that have increased the temperature by 10C; they eventually clash with a group of bandits that threaten their safety. Hell is a great post-apocalyptic drama/thriller.

I really like post-apocalyptic films, and this one really creates an immersive world without depending on heavy special effects; windows are covered, survivors are fully clothed, and travels are best and usually done when the sun is down emphasizing the dangers of the blazing sun. It consistently keeps a dark, survivor-of-the-fittest tone, which I enjoyed. The actual story, however, is a bit predictable and has been done before; the events in this film, like the abduction and cannibal scenes/subplots, have been done before. Also, the ending was unfulfilling and a bit abrupt, but okay, regardless. The acting was good, the music was great, and the cinematography was amazing at certain times.

Overall, I enjoyed Hell; it has action and drama, with a great a setting. As of 12/19/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, if you're not sure about purchasing yet. I recommend a purchase for fans of the post-apocalyptic genre, and a rental, otherwise.

Hell has strong blood and violence, no sex or nudity.",1356134400,3,1335,5.171296296296297
5257040,4,B0094590S0,"This is a post apocalyptic film set in Germany sometime in the future. The sun has scorched the earth, to the point where the ecology of the planet is falling apart. The fields are brown the forest have been burnt and the roads are littered with carcasses of dead animals. The search for food and water is the only thing that the survivors are interested in, that and not being attacked or killed by other survivors.

Into this mix are introduced Marie (Hannah Herzprung) and her sister Leonie who are travelling with erstwhile boyfriend Phillip. They have an old Volvo and have put blackouts on the windows to shield them selves from the rays and heat of the sun. Their aim is to head to the mountains as they have heard that you can still find water there. The supplies and fuel is running low when they hit a petrol/gas station. Only thing is someone is already there.

This is a film that is quite bleak and has constant tension running through out, in an almost unsettling way. The road trip soon runs into problems and once the extent of their situation becomes apparent, there is no going back. This is billed as a Roland Emmerich (`The Day After Tomorrow' and `2012'), but this is actually not like them at all, which is a very good thing. There is no over the top CGI, and the violence is not gratuitous, this trades on the psychological tension which means the audience does not have to have things spelled out for them.

It is in German with very good sub titles and runs for 86 minutes. Some will say it has echoes of `The Road', but it is a film in its own right and whilst it may not be the most original plot ever, it is certainly entertaining.",1354233600,2,1659,4.397394136807818
5257041,4,B0094590S0,"If you like the ""end of time"" type movie, this is a good one.

5257042,3,B0094590S0,"The year is 2016. Because of the increasing solar activity, the earth's temperature has become higher by 10 degrees Celsius. The land has dried up and crops have perished. Modern civilization has collapsed and the earth has become an uninhabitable place for humans. Few survivors keep travelling under the scorching sun, looking for water. Two young sisters Marie and Leonie are among them, travelling with a man named Phillip driving around in a dust-covered car.

Executive-produced by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" and ""2012""), the low-budget post-apocalyptic thriller begins with an interesting premise, but without developing the sci-fi theme, ""Hell"" quickly shifts into a familiar formula about the travelers and their predicaments in the backwoods. In short, you have seen this in ""The Road"" or other horror films.

Tim Fehlbaum's direction is slick once action gets started, but details of this catastrophic disaster remain vague at best. The cinematography of the bleak landscape soaked in overflowing light is impressive enough to live up with the film's double-meaning title (""Hell"" means in German ""bright""), but the effects of the sunshine such as heat and UV exposure are not fully made use of to enhance the film's drama and suspense .

But the real problem of ""Hell"" is that the characters are not really interesting, including the sisters Marie and Leonie. Why are they travelling alone? Why does she have a CD of Nena's ""99 Luftballons""? The film wastes every chance to flesh them out. When the two male characters are less memorable, why should we care? ""Zombieland"" did it much better.

This is not to say ""Hell"" is a terrible film, but as a survival thriller or a H.G. Wells-like modern-day fable ""Hell"" leaves much to be desired, lacking its own voice.",1348617600,7,1780,5.127586206896551
5257043,4,B0094590S0,"With no opportunities to rent this film, besides iTunes, I decided to purchase the film on the strength of the trailer. These days I seem to be a good judge of what I will like based on a trailer.

Hell is a post-apocalyptic film set in the near future 2016. Solar flares have caused mass overheating of our planet laying waste to the environment. With no way to sustain plant or animal life and with natural water supplies all but gone; people will now do anything to survive.

Visually the movie sells the idea the earth is burnt out and desolate. The acting is good, albeit this american version defaults to an over-dubbed english soundtrack. I suggest watching it with subtitles.
For a film like this simplicity is important. All our characters need to do is survive. There are a few little twists and turns that keep it interesting.
Overall a fan of films like this will be more than entertained. And I'm happy to add this film to my collection.",1348617600,7,950,4.549707602339181
5257044,3,B0094590S0,Everybody who likes post apocalyptic movies this is for you. The down side is they made the movie in germany it's not subtitled but the actors speak in german their lips move like a chinese film but every actor has a different american voice.,1347148800,2,242,4.5227272727272725
5257045,4,B0094590S0,"I saw the trailer for it and wasn't really psyched about the moving being in German so I bought it on DVD b/c it said it had the English version. The English  overdub was horrible so I ended up just putting it on German anyway and enjoyed the movie. I liked the premise something a little different, but of course as in all ""end of the world"" movies there has to be cannibalism so that was predictable. I liked the movie until the end. They showed them and I was like ok whats gonna happen next and then the credit rolled. I was like feeling like um? That was it?? Bottom line: Good movie - Horrible ending.",1347062400,,607,4.188034188034188
5257046,2,B0094590S0,"More like boring and predictable. The production values were pretty good, as far as the setting and filming goes, but the story line falls flat. The overdubbing is pretty bad, too. The voices fit the characters fairly well, with a few exceptions, but it's basically like all of the characters are standing in the same room throughout the entire movie. There's no difference in volume due to distance, etc. I'd be curious to see if I would have had a different opinion of the film if it had used subtitles instead. I think it was a big mistake not to spend more time in production when placing the overdubs. Still very predictable, though. At least it was only $9.99 new at Best Buy. Sigh.",1345852800,,688,4.556451612903226
5257047,2,B0094590S0,"The year is 2016. Solar activity has produced a hot bright sun (In German Hell is ""bright."") There has been no crops for 3 years. Society has fallen apart and humans survive in bands seeking out food, water, and gas.

The plot involves three people, then four traveling down the road following the birds toward what may be water. At this point the production reminded me of ""The Road"" a rather boring scenario waiting for things to happen. They find themselves in a stew as the film becomes ""Wrong Turn."" They become captured by religious people who ""have no livestock"" but need to survive. The girls will make good wives.

The movie takes place in a gunless society. It is hard to fathom society has fallen that far in such a short period of time, but I just went with it. Fans of Nina's ""99 Luft Balloons"" will be happy to know her CD survives the apocalypse which BTW the title I bought this film under. The dual meaning of Hell=Bright doesn't translate and I guess ""Bright"" wouldn't bring out the horror.

The film doesn't make it as a slasher or horror film. It is a weak sci-fi thriller, perhaps attempting to be too realistic to be entertaining. It leaves itself open for a sequel, although outside of Leonie (Lisa Vicari) who reminded me of a young Jennifer Lawrence, I didn't relate to them.

8535590,3,B0094590S0,"In German, with English subtitles. Extended stretches of the film have little or no dialog, so the subtitle thing may not be as big an issue.
I like post-Apocalyptic scenario films, but I have mixed reactions to HELL. Solar flares have turned the Earth into a parched wasteland devoid of crops or vegetation or trees-- think the Arizona/Nevada desert. To convey this, the entire film is shot in an over-exposed, bleached out sepia tone. Initially it's compelling, but for feature film it eventually becomes annoying to the eye to watch.
This has all the usual newbie-director, unknown-cast, low-budget drawbacks. Characters are cardboard, and devoid of any individuality-- we don't care about them, or their fates, so the film becomes just another pseudo-video-game with avatar characters and no controller. They blunder into the usual, now-predictable situations on the road. The females are trapped by what a young German director must think the Amish are like. Extended sequences feel like a captive-snuff-film in the making.

Acting is nonexistent, and the script leaves no scope for any acting anyway. HELL combines the basic concept of CARRIERS--twentysomethings in a vehicle driving toward an illusory sanctuary--with the despairing bleakness of THE ROAD. But without the cast or acting chops of either.

I wouldn't spend money to own this--honestly. If you want to give it a try, see it on Amazon Streaming for free.
This is not one I'l be adding to my collection. I give it 3 stars instead of 2 stars because it does have a few moments, and because some people really, really can't get enough of 'Bleak'. But personally, I would re-watch CARRIERS again instead of HELL.

Hope this is helpful. Happy viewing, everybody.",1410048000,,1727,5.117021276595745
8535591,5,B0094590S0,"After reading the Netflix blurb I really wasn't expecting much. And I figured that having to read subtitles wouldn't help things much either. But I was wrong. This was a very well done and enjoyable film. I do understand why so many reviewers gave it less than stellar marks. After all, most American fans of apocalyptic type movies have come to expect non-stop action (violence?) from beginning to end, regardless of whether there is a plausible story line or not. But this film didn't go that way. Here they used realistic settings to create fear, tension, and finally unimaginable horror without have to overdo all the gore we've all come to expect and love in movies of this genre. It was a welcome change. The scenes weren't lavishly done and the characters weren't fleshed out as much as they could have been, but they were more than believable. And instead of shocking the viewer with one graphic scene after another, this film used suggestion and imagination to create a very real sense of horror.

8535593,2,B0094590S0,"Wish it moved at a somewhat faster pace, there's potential for this movie, but it takes too long to get going.  And after the first 15minutes I never got a feeling that it was a post apocalyptic movie.  (spoiler alert from here on out) It turned into just another 'car broke down/stopped, trapped in the hills with cannibals movie'.  Why are 90% of post-apocalyptic movies cannibals.  I don't think that many would turn to that even with the world ending, although this is the movies.",1373500800,,484,4.658823529411765
8535594,3,B0094590S0,"Hell (Bright) (Tim Fehlbaum, 2011)

Hell reminded me a great deal of another, even lower-budget, German film for no real reason I can put my finger on, Jens Wolf's Noctem. While this one has more plot, better acting, and an even bleaker outlook on life, while I was watching it, my mind kept stealing back to Wolf's 2003 effort, which I found quite good given its lack of professional talent both in front of and behind the camera; ""a labor of love"" is, at least when I use it, often a synonym for ""unrepentantly amateur"", but Wolf transcended that and came up with something, if not deathless, quite watchable and a good deal of fun. I got that same vibe from Fehlbaum (Nicht Meine Hochzeit)'s second feature, though I rush to add that with both of these films I'm using the word ""fun"" in a rather loose sense.

Fehlbaum's movie gives us a makeshift family--Tom (Unknown's Stipe Erceg), Marie (The Reader's Hannah Herzsprung), and Leonie (Hanni and Nanni's Lisa Vicari)--living in a post-apocalyptic world where the Earth is moving, ever so slowly, closer to the sun. Being outside without being fully covered is almost instant death. There is no darkness, as we know it, just periods of less light. Tom and co. are making do the way most survivors in this world presumably do--a nomadic existence in a station wagon that contains their earthly possessions, raiding abandoned gas stations for fuel, trying to get to a fabled compound in the mountains where, supposedly, they can settle down. The film's first confrontation comes at an abandoned fuel station, where another drifter, Phillip (Home for the Weekend's Lars Eidinger), attempts to make off with some of their stuff, and instead ends up coming along for the ride. But that's a minor inconvenience compared to what happens when they finally make it to the mountains and find out that yes, the compound does exist--but that they're not taking new applicants...

It's an interesting genre thriller that has pretensions at being more than it is. This is not at all a bad thing, and Fehlbaum, who also co-wrote with longtime partner Oliver Kahl and Anatomy scribe Thomas Wbke, is to be commended for his ambition. That the movie ultimately fails in those pretensions takes nothing away from its status as a good, solid genre thriller once the core characters get into the mountains and the game of cat-and-mouse begins; if you decide to pop this one into the DVD player, you'll get an entertaining piece of cinema, though little more than that. But oftentimes that's all you need. ***",1363737600,,2540,4.834482758620689
8535595,5,B0094590S0,"5/5 I loved this movie. There is a moment where one of the character's loses respect for another character for being a coward, and that in particular stuck with me.

I'm sure its all been done before, but that doesn't mean this wasn't an enjoyable film. The cinematography was great as well.

Worth watching.",1361664000,,308,4.685185185185185
