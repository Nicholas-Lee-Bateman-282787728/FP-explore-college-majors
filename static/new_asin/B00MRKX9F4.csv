6600402,5,B00MRKX9F4,"This review is of the 2014 Criterion Blu-ray. The film quality is stunning, and there are many extras - as you expect from Criterion.
The story involves a group of upperclass Italians, initially on a yacht cruise. When a young woman goes missing after the yacht stops at a small remote island, the group searches the island for her, but soon loses interest in the search. Her fiance and her best friend, however, are determined to find her, while the others continue the cruise. The two searchers fall in love, eventually hoping that they will not find the missing girl. This is one of the all time great movies, but mainly of interest to film buffs as it is long and slow moving, with little action - the action is all internal to the characters. Highly recommended.",1441065600,15,767,4.605839416058394
6600403,4,B00MRKX9F4,"A film I need to see again, and wouldn't be surprised to love more on repeated viewings. I appreciate Antonioni's magnificent framing and images, his bravery with unconventional plotting; (e.g. having his true 'main character' disappear 10 minutes in). It's legendarily slow pace didn't bother me at all, but I did find the insights into the characters, how empty and desperate they are somewhat repetitive over time. I'll admit to moments of feeling 'yeah, I got it already'.

Antonioni brilliantly uses lonely landscapes to show how isolated these people are. But some of the performances didn't thrill me (there's a key difference between playing a shallow character and being a shallow actor, and it sometimes seems confused here).

It stayed a very intellectual experience - an essay about the lack of humanity in the upper classes beautifully illustrated. But it seemed so removed and exaggerated, even from my own comfy existence, that I found I wasn't moved on a deeper level.

That said, all these same criticisms could be aimed at 'Barry Lyndon', a film I have come to love deeply on repeated viewings. Like that film, I suspect I'll see much more next time I watch it. The telling thing is I find myself anxious to re-see it, in spite of it's challenges.",1439510400,17,1265,4.901869158878505

6600406,5,B00MRKX9F4,"There are ample reviews of this movie to go around. It's a classic, so I'll just add that this new transfer is fabulous. I've seen this picture over and over again in theaters and on dvd.  I remember suffering through the old, high-contrast VHS versions. Then upgrade from the earlier Criterion version feels significant here visually and the sound, while not spectacular, is less hard sounding and feels natural in the overall mix. My only gripe with Criterion is the price, as they are rarely discounted and pretty much more expensive than anything else on the market. However, when you buy one typically you know where your money went. This one is well worth it. A lyrical and visually sumptuous movie given an even better treatment than before. Throw away your other copies.",1434758400,8,778,4.849624060150376

6600410,5,B00MRKX9F4,"My favorite movie.  Inspired by the  existentialism of Journey to Italy, Antonioni conceived the story, wrote the screenplay, and directed this masterpiece.  A woman disappears, her fiance and best friend search for her.  Don't be fooled, there's nothing ordinary about this film.  If you're looking for a relaxing evening, don't go near this film.  You won't be able to go to sleep, not because it's scary or heartwarming or any of the ordinary emotions.  This film raises as many questions as it answers, but that's not the point of it.  Watch it and you'll know what I mean.",1417392000,33,577,4.816326530612245
6600411,4,B00MRKX9F4,"What would a beautiful girl like you to do when your best friend's boyfriend goes after you.  You know it's wrong to get romantically involved while your best friend is still out there missing.  Part of you doubts his loyalty, part of you shamefully wishes your best friend hadn't return so you could have him all to yourself.  Will there be a future for you and him despite possible scandals?  Will his love be true or ... will it be a slap in the face?

This movie starts out very casually and slowly.  Then it turns into a romantic adventure as Claudia and her best friend's boyfriend ( Sandro ) went out searching for the missing girl ( Ana.)  The movie was about Claudia's own adventure, growing from an innocent, romantic girl in love to a mature woman who had seen the reality of marriage ( between Patrizia and Raimondo ,) love affair ( Giulia and the young painter )  and the ultimate betrayal.  The movie was also about the struggle between Sandro's pursuit/persuasion, Claudia feeling guilty, and Claudia's insecurity about Sandro's loyalty.

The movie was beautifully shot in high contrast black and white film, with the eternally gorgeous Monica Vitti ( Claudia ) against the backdrop of the breath taking sceneries of Italy.  Even by half the movie, the audience still doesn't know which way the movie would turn.  The movie is not fast paced, very ""real time"" mood and is not contrived, making it emotionally effective.  It'll transport you through space ( Italy ) and time  ( 1960s ) on a romantic journey, with the unforgettable Claudia.

Now, where's my ""Italian for Dummies"" book?",1413849600,15,1599,4.742753623188406
8674362,5,B00MRKX9F4,"Seminal art film and masterpiece of brilliant Italian director Michelagelo Antonioni. Profoundly intellectual, existential exploration of alienation, the void of communication, loss of identity, and the need for meaning. Notoriously discussed dense plot has a yacht trip of bored, vacant upper-class friends which suddenly becomes a search party when one mysteriously goes missing, virtually vanishing, and how the subsequent search slowly succumbs to the ennui and passions of her shallow boyfriend and her confused best friend. Slowly paced and meticulously composed visually. The unforgettable atmosphere of barren, rocky Sicilian islands, the expanse and sounds of the sea, the eerie empty city straight from a DeChirico painting, and the overwhelming motif of architecture and symbolic use of empty space- make no mistake- this is film as art, elevated to a visual language. At the time of it's release this was lost on most viewers, too caught up in the story over it's composition and open interpretation, and to be fair Antonioni's films are an acquired taste. Still, this is an undeniable classic landmark and an important entry for an education in cinema. This Criterion Collection Blu ray definitely surpassed my expectations, it's knowledgeable full-length commentary, analysis, and interviews are essential to get a complete understanding of how to best enjoy the film's intricate details, style, and intentions. Also recommended: La Notte, L'eclisse, and of course the phenomenon Blow Up, all by Antonioni and follow (even expand on) a similar style and theme.",1531008000,,1574,5.535269709543568

8674364,5,B00MRKX9F4,"Arresting compositions; a story that starts as a missing person mystery but then isn't. In some sense every person here is missing.  A stunning, demanding masterpiece.  The blu-ray is fantastic, well up to Criterion's lofty standards.",1517788800,,234,5.472222222222222
8674365,4,B00MRKX9F4,"Released the same year as Fellini's classic ""La Dolce Vita"" both films in their own way deal with the Italy of the time not long after the end of World War II and with the shallowness and hollow ""ideals"" of the youth who appear to chase short term joy in expense of deeper values that take time to achieve.  While I personally like Fellini's film better this Antonioni film is still very good and rewards the patient viewer who expects more substance from and hence greater long term reward and satisfaction from film.  Fans of today's fast paced throwaway films like the ""Transformer"" series will not enjoy this and have been warned.  The pacing of this film is deliberate and perhaps indicts the impatient viewer as well as it shows the impatience of the principal players who so quickly forget what it was that they so urgently needed to do at the start (find the missing friend) to look for the next ""adventure"".  The ending for me was very satisfying indicating that redemption is still possible if at least one of the offended parties is willing to forgive - having a short memory/focus can be a curse and a blessing.  For the patient fan of art-cinema this film will certainly reward repeated viewing but if you prefer your films require little intelligent thought and involvement from you then this is not for you.  The Criterion release is good as expected and I have no complaints over either the picture or sound qualities.

Highly recommended!",1511222400,,1455,4.7047244094488185
