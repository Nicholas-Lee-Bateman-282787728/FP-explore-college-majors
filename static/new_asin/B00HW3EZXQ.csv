6230728,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"Stylish and a bit different, though at times absurd. It works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Definitely fatal attraction meets american psycho.",1392249600,3,158,5.625
6230729,5,B00HW3EZXQ,It was exactly like I expected. It had that cult film feel and the dialogue was that cheesy kind of witty. You can never go wrong with exaggerated blood. I really loved it!,1392163200,,172,4.242424242424242
6230730,1,B00HW3EZXQ,"Let me first start out by saying I can not express exactly how BAD this movie really is!  This movie has taken one hour and 24 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  I know, I tried,...but it's gone.  That being said, I'm going to try my best to keep others from suffering the same fate as me!  Again, this movie is HORRIBLE!  I've seen a few movies in my day that were horrible, but I was able to sit through and enjoy parts of them.  Not this one.  I'm really bummed out because I've been hearing about this movie for some time now on the horror blogs/sites and was looking forward to it.  It's not just the generic storyline, but the acting is beyond terrible!  I have no idea how Paz de la Huerta managed to talk her way into this role, but they deserve the firing that they will inevitably receive.

*******WARNING!!!!  I'm going to completely RUIN this movie (just like it ruined one hour and 24 minutes of my life)*******

The movie begins with nurse, Abby Russell (Paz de la Huerta) hanging out at a local club trying to lure married men into a trap.  She attempts to flirt with them and leaves them one last chance to change their minds before further pursuing them.  She baits the first guy and within seconds, he's hooked.  He quickly follows her to the roof for what he thinks is going to be a night to remember.  However, she's got different plans in mind and takes a scalpel to his artery.  She then gives him two options:  FIRST, he can attempt to get away and bleed out, or SECOND, he can take the ""easy"" way out and end his own life by leaping from the roof.  Of course, she then goes for a third option and as he inches towards the side she tosses him over herself.

Now, at this point (the first 5-10 minutes) I was thinking, ""Sweet!  It's kind of like Dexter!""  You know, doing evil, but for good!  I have to admit,...even with the bad acting, they sucked me in!  Well done, movie,....well done!  Then things took a turn for the worse,....

The next day, we meet Danni (Katrina Bowden), a new nurse that has caught Abby's eye.  Addy and Danni quickly became friends during Danni's residency and now it is Danni's first day on the job.  Danni freezes during a procedure with a patient and completely messes things up, which angers Dr. Morris (Judd Nelson).  Danni is sure she will be fired so Abby takes the opportunity to comfort her and ask her out for drinks to make her feel better.  Danni agrees and they head to a local bar.

The next morning Danni awakens with no memory of the previous night's events, but chalks it up to drinking and heads into work.  She passes Dr. Morris in the hall and is awaiting a scolding, but instead is treated with a friendly, ""Look, we got off on the wrong foot.""  This pleases Danni, until Dr. Morris forces himself against her in what would be a sure-fire sexual assault lawsuit.  Of course, this is a (terrible) movie, and those things don't happen here so she goes about her business.

Abby overhears Danni and her boyfriend, Steve (Corbin Bleu), arguing over the phone.  Abby again, sees this as an opportunity and tells Danni she should leave him.  Danni says that she might just need to stay with her mom for a while, but that she hates her step dad, Larry (Martin Donovan).  She says, that's the reason she needs to stay with her because Larry treats her mother so poorly.  This peeks Abby's interest, so she sets out to find Larry.  When she does, she makes quick work of him by injecting a medicine into his neck causing paralysis (all the while setting Danni up,...you know,...just in case).  She then runs his car into traffic and, yep, he's gone.

At the funeral, Danni sees Abby talking to Detective John Rogan (Boris Kodjoe).  When she questions Abby about their discussion, Abby reveals that she's been a patient to Larry (he's a Psychiatrist).  Suspicions arise and Abby begins to look into Danni's past. Danni becomes more and more distant with Abby, so Abby starts sending Danni emails containing pictures that were taken when she was drunk during their night out.

It's at this point, the hospital gets a new PR manager, Rachael (Melanie Scrofano).  When Rachael meets Abby, she insists that she looks like someone she used to know (obviously).  Abby quickly asks her out for drinks in which Rachael accepts.  As Danni is asleep that night, she receives a Skype request from Rachael.  Abby can be seen in the background and as Danni tried to warn Rachael (she's too drunk to notice), the screen goes black.  Danni calls 911 and the police head out.

The next day, Danni is at the police station being questioned when she sees Abby talking to the Detective.  After Abby leaves, the detective confronts Danni, saying that Abby is accusing her of being obsessed and stalking.  When Danni attempts to respond, Detective Rogan brings out the pics that Abby took for the night out drinking.  This causes Steve to get angry and leave Danni.

Danni finally takes time to look into the little girl Rachael spoke about,...and wouldn't you know it?!  She's the same girl!  (of COURSE she's the same girl.  It's ALWAYS the same girl,..we've seen this story a million times!)  Danni rushes back to the hospital.  Abby is already there, when she is approached by Dr. Morris.  He says that Danni has told him some things and that he either needs to look into it, or maybe they can talk about it.  Abby takes poor Dr. Morris down to the morgue (where else?!) where he thinks he's about to have a good time and instead gets his arm chopped off (only after she carves the word ""Pig"" into his chest).  Poor Dr. Morris.

During the last part of the movie, it pretty much turns into a bloodbath.  During all the ruckus, Steve is killed (by scissors to the neck) and Abby somehow manages to get away.  She then finds herself face to face with Detective Rogan.  He attempts to arrest her, but before he can, HE is killed by a bat to the head (courtesy of her neighbor).

The movie ending matches the rest of the movie,...TERRIBLE!  Of course, she's gotten away with it and who would even THINK to look for her afterwards, right?!  But this time she's gotten a new job and taken Rachael's identity (sort of), leaving a path for a potential sequel.  Oh wow,.....a sequel.  I can't even imagine?!  I'll leave that for someone else to review.

There might be some parts I'm not EXACT on, but that's the gist of the movie.  I can't remember every little detail, because to tell you the truth, I was just wishing for it to be over.  However, once I start something, I usually don't stop (especially with a horror movie) in hopes that it will eventually get better.  So again, under no circumstances should you waste even one second of your life on this movie!  I can not stress this enough! I just can't understand how the people involved can't see this and actually let it out for the world to see?!",1392076800,10,6856,4.489068825910931
6230731,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"Abby (Paz de la Huerta) is a nurse by day and a vamp by night. At night she lures married men into seduction and then kills them for cheating on their spouse. Abby sees young Danni (Katrina Bowden) as an apprentice. She seduces Danni, in spite of the fact Danni has a boyfriend and doesn't remember the incident. Danni quickly sees through Abby as someone who is troubled and wants out of their friendship. Abby doesn't take too kindly to the snub and it is ""Game on.""

Her make up looks odd in that she wears excessive lip stick and does nothing for her eyes.

This film is grindhouse/pulp fiction . There is plenty of blood, comedy, dark comedy, and nudity. Niecy Nash provides additional humor as a nurse who wants sex, but never gets it.

Worth a view for some laughs.

F-bombs, sex, and nudity as one might expect. Paz de la Huerta has two scenes where she walks around bottomless looking like an airbrushed manikin.",1391904000,10,921,4.497005988023952

6230733,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"It's a shame that crappy ""found footage"" horror flicks get wide theatrical releases and really entertaining movies like ""Nurse"" get limited (if any) theatrical runs.

Paz De La Huerta plays Abby, a New York City nurse whose hobbies include ridding the city (permanently) of unfaithful men.  Newbie nurse Danni (Katrina Bowden) becomes Abby's new ""project,"" and she has very odd ways of being her mentor.  After a drunken nighttime romp, Danni realizes that Abby isn't playing with a full deck, and tries to distance herself from her.  But Abby won't have that, and that's when the body count begins.  It's mostly played tongue-in-cheek, but those who do not like graphic violence and spurting blood won't be amused.  It's definitely not a movie that plays it safe - ""Nurse"" is packed with gruesome murders and explicit nudity.  This is a definite must-see for exploitation and horror fans - it isn't scary at all but it's a fast-paced, deranged good time.",1391904000,3,955,4.968553459119497

This alone makes it worthwhile. As with any well done 3D film, if you see in 2D you lose most of its impact.  As many note this is a deliberate parody so if you don't get that you miss the point.

6230801,1,B00HW3EZXQ,"Sometimes lesser-known actors will put in heroic performances to save a bad script in an attempt to burnish their reputation among filmmakers. This isn't one of those movies.

With the exception of Niecy Nash in her minor role as nurse-receptionist, the cast took a bad script and executed it poorly.  Even the T&A scenes were too forced to be titillating, so it fails as softcore porn.  They manged to make beautiful women gettiin it on with ripped guys (and each other) look boring.  The plot-hole-ridden slasher scenes are too contrived be thrilling, so that fails too.  Decent camera work and nice bods can't save this dud.",1471651200,,627,4.877358490566038

Paz de la Huerta (as Abby Russell) plays a damaged psychopath who just happens to be a sexy nurse. I know this is probably a sexist, exploitative film, but it worked for me on several levels. You could probably call it a horror movie, but it does have some humorous elements here and there; though not enough to take away from the violence. At the beginning of the movie, it looks like Abby is an unfaithful-man-vigilante, but as the movie progresses, she increases the scope of her homicidal proclivities. I enjoyed de la Huerta's immersion in the role; it was definitely not too campy and allowed the viewer just a touch of empathy for her. Katrina Bowden (as Danni Rogers) was also very good as the object of Abby's affection early on, and her opponent later in the film.

""Nurse,"" on the other hand, can only be seen as a blow to the set of movie-making. It is one of the most awkward, amateurish, and unsavory attempts at cinema I've seen in many years. I had to split it in two and take several hours between the halves to finish watching this assault on entertainment. Afterward, I felt I needed a shower. Ugly. A career-killer...

Poor Paz de la Huerta. Done up in kewpie-doll makeup, and a hairdo that appears to be the pelt of some unfortunate small mammal atop her head; given leaden dialogue that she recites (much of it in overdubbed narration) in a sleepy, slurred tone (a la Melanie Griffith 20 years ago, on a morning after a life-altering bender).

The movie attempts sexiness, but never achieves it. It attempts tension, but only achieves pointlessness due to lack of pace. And it attempts slasher-horror, but is merely gratuitously cruel and gross.
So...writing, acting, direction, cinematography -- all abysmal. This film is toxic and should be avoided.",1462060800,2,1292,4.894977168949771

6232362,5,B00HW3EZXQ,"Well...according to the reviews, you are probably not going to like this, nevertheless,  there is a certain type of person who will enjoy it immensely, consequently, what type of person are you?
Do you enjoy movies that have been labeled,  ""B movies?""  Have you ever enjoyed a show that, some reviewers said, ""it is so bad, it is good?""  Do you enjoy suspending reality, and allowing yourself to be transported to another realm?  Do you have a taste for the bizarre...for extreme sex, and violence?  If so, maybe Nurse is your kind of show.  Look at the photo.  Does it look as if it was meant to be taken seriously.  Perhaps this could be called a dark, sexy, murder satire.  Clearly, the intent, was to make fun of a serious situation.
Give it a chance.  You may find it very entertaining, and funny, and for people who enjoy such things, you will at least see some extremely beautiful naked women, lots of blood,  provocative dialog, and some very creative murders.
Watch a few minutes, then decide if you want to continue - the feeling of the movie, and probably your impression,  is unlikely to change much.  If you do not like it after the cheater is pushed off the skyscraper, you will probably never like it.

I understand this was an exploitation film, but there needs to something worth sticking around for otherwise it's pointless shlock.

And It seemed as if she went and got herself some Botox right before shooting because her face did not move. The gory scenes were just that... gory scenes to be gory scenes with no merit or true need to be part of the story line. **This is the SPOILER** The story has been told many times... child traumatized, child hospitalized, child released as maladjusted adult with Daddy issues that she takes out on all men.** I think I wrote that in fourth grade. I say even if you've already binge watched everything and are dying for something to watch, skip this. Go for a walk. Watch anything else. The Ranch, a Netflix original, is surprisingly good despite Kutcher's silly attempt at a Southern accent. Watch that. Sam Elliott is still hot. So's his mustache.",1461110400,,1030,4.455026455026455

The second lead actress ...Nurse Danni... and everyone but ""Horrible"" kept it going.

6233899,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"The movie is very much a cliche.  The story is kind of a combination of things that have been seen before.  A serial killer nurse who is not what she claims, becomes obsessed with a co-worker and kills or severely injures almost everyone.  The good thing is that it does not take itself too seriously and embraces the fact that it is a B level part thriller part slasher/horror movie.  No, it does not have an all star cast, and will never be up for an academy award.  Much of it is an excuse  to show Paz De La Huerta in various states of undress or skimpy outfits.  She does play a pretty good sociopath with hits of BS crazy mixed in.  The last 20 min or so is the most violent and gory, so if sex, nudity and violence are deal breakers for you when it comes to a movie, then you want to skip this one.

The movie will play in 3D or 2D depending on your blu ray player, but does not have separate discs for each.  For extras there is an 8 min behind the scenes/making of feature, a commentary track and a 5 min feature that alternates following Katrina Bowden and Corbin Bleu around during production.  Okay for what is there, but nothing too extensive.  It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you accept what it is and do not expect it to be anything other than what it is, then it makes for an enjoyable way to kill and hour and a half.",1436572800,,1352,4.1183206106870225

6233943,3,B00HW3EZXQ,"The story in ""Nurse 3D"" is filled with revenge and thrills guided by a nurse who moonlights as a twisted serial killer that sees herself as a vigilante. The air and breath in which Huerta moves within as this complicated character is at times a disconnect between her portrayal and the believability of the character. Yet Huerta seems so committed to the character that she manages to draw you into the story. Her infatuation with fellow nurse Danni, played by Bowden is instantaneous so you become thrust into this twisted tangle of love, affection, and destruction right from the get-go. All provided through the viewpoint of nurse Abby Russell. The way ""Nurse 3D"" flows has that weird, casual anti-heroine feel that ""Barbwire"" presented. A very Euro feel at times seeming to be influenced by modern giallo and French noir. The actors prove their commitment to the characters but at times the emotional connection flat- lines in the film. There is an overture of camp in the film but more mature and indirect than most films in this same subgenre.

Everything about ""Nurse 3D"" moves to an odd beat but it shows a fun, comfortable and fully committed direction to entertain and push sexploitation. An aspect of horror that even today seems to be shunned by mainstream cinema. Kudos to the team behind this film for moving forward in sketchy territory. This isn't a film for every horror fan because the camp is just atmospheric and never direct or the focal point. The fetish enticement is strong and at times presents almost unrealistic situations but even those moments are somewhat entertaining. I enjoyed ""Nurse 3D"" for the unusual approach the director took, the cinematography is beautiful and the body count is noteworthy. Plus the nudity is a fun visual companion to the hot, character's situational drama. Much like ""Barbwire"" and even Aarniokoski's television work, ""Nurse 3D"" is obvious in what it offers, (in this case it is fetish-sex- death-obsession), with talented, off-beat vision that is creative and entertaining without demanding the audience to be affected by traditional pomp and circumstance. At first I felt that I wasn't going to be able to get into the film but by the middle of the film I was invested and pleased with ""Nurse 3D"". It has a large cult status awaiting it in it's future.",1432080000,,2313,4.915601023017903

6233949,3,B00HW3EZXQ,"Abby Russell (Paz de la Huerta) is a highly-regarded, well-respected nurse by day, and a serial killer specializing in killing unfaithful males by night. Produced by Lions Gate Entertainment, a company known for such hit series as Saw and The Expendables, obviously Nurse is not meant to be taken seriously.

Thats fine, but while Nurse sets out to be a sexy, funny and campy fun movie, unfortunately the film is not as sexy, funny or campy as it should be.

The biggest problem is the script. The thin story, which is about Abbys friendship with a younger nurse played by Katrina Bowden, does not leave much room for the killing nurse to show what she is capable of. Most of her methods of killing are not surprising or innovative. Supporting players including Martin Donovan, Judd Nelson and Kathleen Turner are wasted.

The movie was not quite what I expected it was better. I enjoyed the commentary on this movie which the Director pointed out the stunt double did an excellent job of mimicking the star. I'd say this is the best overall 3D movie I've ever seen. In other words it would stand alone as 2D.,1420070400,,426,3.9651162790697674

6234064,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"Abby Russell (Paz De La Huerta) is a sexy Exterminating Angel best avoided by any philanderer who wants to protect his femoral artery or the nads adjacent.

Abby's manner of seducing men or establishing a lesbian relationship is as subtle as the tailfins on a 60's Cadillac.

Her idea of creating a romantic mood involves lighting more candles than might be found in the Vatican.

Danni (Katrina Bowden) is there to be the object of Abby's desire and to serve as a contrast since she wears panties when she showers while Abby dons a bra but walks about bottomless.

Judd Nelson plays a sexist, troglodyte, horn dog whose time on Earth is too long and whose death is too quick.

Kathleen Turner appears in a cameo so brief it makes a person wonder if ""ina"" or ""ette"" or ""mini"" could be slapped on ""cameo"" to alert her fans not to blink.

Jared (Adam Herschman) is there from the start offering aid and protection to Abby; and he steps up to the plate when he is most needed.

Everything not over the top in plot and character is supersaturated in color and visual effect making this the best nurse as a psycho-killer in 3D movie ever made.

6234066,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"Nurse is a dark comedy mixed with suspense and exoticness.  The suspense only occurs occasionally.  The movie is about the mentally warped/messed up character of Pa De La Huerta going around killing men in graphic fashion.  Not just any man- men that have an interest in kinky cheating sex but have a wife and children.  She has a particular interest in killing and sadistically torturing these men!  She leads them to building rooftops or parked cars and paralyzes them by stabbing needles into their necks (and if you notice she has a strong interest in the neck- she's either stabbing guys in the neck or using a scissor-type device to rip through the back of their neck so blood squirts through their throats in gushing delightful fashion!)

There's another element to this story.  The character of Abby Russell who I must say is absolutely BEAUTIFUL becomes a nurse, and Pa De La Huerta and Abby hit off an unintentional relationship (Pa drugs her one night and makes her do the dirty deed without Abby realizing it, so she wakes up the next day confused and uncertain what happened the night before and thus they're now a couple!)  However when it becomes apparent to Pa that Abby isn't interested in her sexually, Abby goes to the police to get the situation with Pa taken care of, however due to a traumatic event that Pa experienced as a child, she has this ability to be one step ahead of Abby all the time so Abby is the one who ends up looking guilty!  Come to think of it, the writing throughout this film isn't much different from the lady in the Hand That Rocks the Cradle and the prostitute from Monster combined.  Pa's character is basically a combination of the two!

Expect a LOT of sexual situations to occur.  The mood, the writing, the quiet and seductive way these characters interact... Nurse is almost an adult film in disguise.  It's one step away from being an adult movie seriously.  Pa De La Huerta is more like a stripper than a nurse, and oddly I feel the writing misses a few marks in the setting.  While the ending is blood-gushingly violent for a few minutes, it would have been better had the hospital setting been more prominent.  It seems the hospital is more like a place for perverts to slap each others butts and for sexual situations to develop which is really odd but then again the whole movie is odd for cryin' out loud!  Oh and the nurse who signs up for the job and she's exceptionally smiley while talking to the other nurses... the presence of her character is pure gold!",1413763200,,2519,4.562222222222222

6234159,5,B00HW3EZXQ,"Dont let the seductive cover for this movie fool you:  this nurse does NOT want to help you get better!  Quite the contrary, in fact.  NURSE 3D is a slick horror film that does not disappoint, especially when it comes to tension.  And despite its simple title, theres nothing simple about this movie.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one.  I had heard mixed things about it, which always piques my interest even more.  And my buddy Hayes over at Hayes Hudson's House of Horror called it a must-see, so I knew I had to give it a shot.  And Im glad I didthis is one heck of a horror flick!

NURSE looks stunning onscreen, from the way it is shot to the graphic imagery throughout.  I am very impressed with the cinematography, especially considering this is a 3D movie; many times, the film style suffers because of the 3D aspect.  Not so here.  This film looks amazing in almost every aspect.  And theres nothing like seeing phenomenal three-dimensional blood-sprays!

The acting in NURSE is very good.  Although Paz de la Huerta has top-billing, and she does a great job, there are several other cast members worth note.  One that sticks out specifically to me is Katrina Bowden who portrays Danni.  Ive enjoyed Bowdens work since TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL, and I hope to see more of her in future productions.

The special effects in NURSE are excellent, and theres plenty of carnage to satiate the heartiest of gore-hounds.  La Hueras character Abby doles out murder and mayhem aplenty, and the body count rises along the way.  I like the visceral use of blood-sprays, especially captured in 3D.  This is the way horror is meant to be experienced!

NURSE is a heck of a good time, and I recommend giving it a look.  Its chocked full of crazy fun, so be ready for a thrill-ride.  And be sure to watch it in 3D if you get the chance; you won't be sorry.",1401408000,,1863,4.476190476190476

The makers of the film paint everything in broad strokes but for the most part it oddly falls hollow.  There are two reasons to recommend the film most notably the performance of Paz de la Huerta whose take on psychotic nurse Abby Russell is sly and knowing.  De la Huerta sees the irony in the premise that escapes the makers of  the film.  Classic scene of her ordering takeout after dispatching another ""cheater"" is priceless.  The twist ending is also pretty clever but a case of too little too late.  Regardless, a cult affair that probably has its acolytes.",1400976000,,739,4.808

It also doesn't help that the movie is rife with cliches. Still, the few moments that gorehounds will want are there, even if there's not enough of them.

6234239,5,B00HW3EZXQ,"I had a feeling this movie was going to be good based on the trailer, but I had no clue it would be as good as it was.  Actually, using the word good does not do this film justice.  This film is great.  It's wonderful.  It's amazing!  Ok, enough of that.....here is the plot synopsis from the Lionsgate website:

Paz de la Huerta (HBOs ""Boardwalk Empire"") turns up the body heat in this wickedly entertaining story of a fatal attraction. By day, nurse Abby Russell (de la Huerta) lovingly attends to the patients at All Saints Memorial Hospital; by night, Abby prowls nightclubs, luring unfaithful men into dangerous liaisons. After Danni, a young, sensitive nurse, joins the hospital staff, Abby pursues her friendship. But when the friendship turns to obsession, Danni spurns Abby, unleashing Abbys fury and a rampage of terror.

  My one thought that kept going through my head the entire time I was watching this movie was ""how has this movie not got more notoriety than it has""?  This film should be being talked about on all the horror websites and forums, but I  rarely see anything about it.  This film was one of the best films I have seen in a while.  I loved every second of it.

  First off, lets just get this out of the way right now.  I know most people will say I liked it just because lead actress Paz De La Huerta is naked in this movie...a lot.  She has the most amazing, close to perfect body you will probably ever see.  While that aspect of the film was enjoyable, she could have been covered from head to toe in layers and layers of clothing and I still would have loved this movie.  It was one of the most well written films I have seen in a while.  I haven't seen a good psychological thriller in ages, but this one is among the top.  The story is great with some awesome plot twists and turns.  There is also some pretty good gore for all your gore fans out there (like me!), although most of the gore is pretty crappy CGI.  Even so, that didn't take away from the enjoyment of this film because the gore plays a very minor part in the film as a whole.  The real substance of this film was the fatal attraction style relationship between Abby and Danni.  It's amazing the way Abby manipulates Danni and everyone else around here with her sweet, sexy demeanor. As sweet as she is on the outside, she is equally evil on the inside.

  If you have not seen NURSE 3D, do yourself a favor and see it asap!  Everything about this movie was great to me, even the music which I admit I don't normally pay attention to in most films.  If this film has a CD soundtrack, I will be buying it for sure.  Now, if you are trying to decide whether to get the DVD which is in 2D, or the Blu-ray which is in 3D and 2D, I would go ahead and get the Blu-ray since it has both versions.  I will say though, that the 3D aspect of this film is pretty lame from what I could tell.  I have no clue why they even bothered to put this movie in 3D.  The film does not need a gimmick like that.  I watched this film in 2D and was amazed by it.  I only saw 2 or 3 scenes I could tell were made for the 3D aspect and they seemed cheesy and corny when watching it in 2D.  That being said, though, I still LOVED this movie and consider it a must have film for any horror fan.  I know this is one I will be watching again very soon!",1399593600,,3324,4.182965299684542

The movie has some gory scenes,and some of the dialogue is actually witty and funny. There are things they could have done to make this film better. But,for the type of film it is,it's not that bad.

6234285,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"First of all, this movie is not for everyone. There is a lot of blood, nudity, and language. It is not a straight up horror film; more of a black comedy with all the elements of horror. There is revenge, anger, brutality, seduction...and a female lead performance (Paz De La Huerta) that rivals some of the most conniving female villains we've come to know so well.

The plot, as it is, basically revolves around a nurse who is less than stable...and out to do away with cheating men (and anyone else who stands in her way). De La Huerta is absolutely brilliant in the role, and the supporting cast does well (or at least as well as the likes of Judd Nelson and Katrina Bowden are capable of doing).

Every week it seems there are a few bland, less than creative horror films released to video. The genre is in desperate need of some creativity, and this movie (along with ""Excision"") provide some of that. One may argue that exploitation is not creativity, but at least this film is intriguing. There is something about a great female lead in horror films, and this film has got something going for it. Recommended for fans of revenge films and comedy horror along the lines of ""Excision"" and ""Girls vs. Boys."" To this film's credit, it steers away from becoming a run of the mill torture flick, courtesy of De La Huerta and her off beat delivery of sharp one liners and unpredictable behavior throughout.",1399334400,2,1406,4.575396825396825

6234292,1,B00HW3EZXQ,"I've considered the possibility of what this movie could have been a parody of. It overly sexually driven and hardly well made, which I guess I could consider where the joke lies. But really that doesn't keep the movie from being obnoxious as all hell and not well made. If it's meant to be overly sexy, it doesn't come off that way. It comes off more annoying and tedious than anything. The amount of stereotypes used in this film could point to parody except for the fact that they feel blatantly like stereotypes and not a joke on the stereotype. Consider the film Black Dynamite. It is very self aware in it's intention to pay both homage and parody the blacksploitation genre. This does none of that. I don't recommend this film. I think for that amount of money you could watch a good movie.",1398038400,,797,4.503448275862069
6234293,4,B00HW3EZXQ,This is probably one of the better horror movies I've seen so far this year. This is one nurse you don't want to mess with. Pretty fun to watch horror comedy. The nurse is sexy and crazy as heck! Good special effects and pretty nasty at times. I'd recommend if you like cheesy horror comedy movies. Hope to see a sequel!,1397865600,6,320,4.262295081967213
6234294,5,B00HW3EZXQ,"The Nurse stars Paz de la Huerta as Abby, who takes revenge out on married men who are out on the town & trying to cheat on there wives. At first I thought de la Huerta was a man in drag, I hate to sound cruel but she looks like a man in some parts of the movie. Anyway, Abby meets a new nurse & beguns a deadly realtionship with her. The opening credits are neat & the whole movie was enjoyable overall, I wanted to view it again after watching it. I would welcome a sequel if de la Huerta returns. Highly recommended to fans of trashy horror flicks who don't expect too much.",1397692800,4,577,4.026086956521739
6234295,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"This is a great little slasher/revenge film that centers around a twisted nurse that had a messed up childhood. There's plenty of eye candy throughout the film and plenty of slasher-type kills. One thing I didn't care for was how they do all the kills with fake CG blood, like in ""300"". The actors and actresses do have stage blood on, but all the kills are exaggerated because of the computerized FX, instead of props and stage blood. This is definitely worth a rental and even a buy if you can find it for about $10.00 or so. If you like slasher films, with a neat little back story and you like gory kills and sex, then definitely check this one out. It's the perfect midnight movie for modern horror fans!! I would also recommend ""Passion"" with Noomi Rapace and ""Chloe"" with Liam Neeson. These films serve as excellent companion films to add to your collection, along with ""Nurse""! Also, if you like straight-up revenge films, check out ""The Brave One"" with Jodie Foster (for female revenge) and check out the ""Death Wish"" films, starring Charles Bronson (for classic male revenge).

6234297,5,B00HW3EZXQ,"Nurse had me from its first minute of screen time. It started off as a clever and trashy dark comedy with an excellent, campy performance courtesy of Paz de la Huerta. And when she's not delivering tasty dialogue, she's delivering even tastier nudity. But in the final act, Nurse changes gears and becomes a gory slasher flick, which took me by pleasant surprise since I am a slasher fan. If you're looking for a good time, Nurse has the prescription you need!",1397001600,,460,4.621951219512195
6234298,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"I took a chance on this because I like low budget cheesy horror movies. This movie is not the best due to over-simplified acting and semi-cheesy story telling. The directing and cinematography could have been much better, but over-all it was fun. For what they were going for, they pulled it off well.

3D was decent for this type of movie, yet it wasn't always perfect (2D & 3D are both on the same disc). The PQ was good, but many scenes could have been sharper and clearer. AQ was pretty good as well

Extras are a bit light, but for this type of movie I wouldn't really want to see anything more. If you liked the simple style movies like Midnight Meat Train, My Bloody Valentine 3D or Freddy vs. Jason's silly style acting and directing, you'll probably like Nurse 3D.

I don't regret Blind buying it, so I guess that's a good sign. But it is violent and there is plenty of nudity. I didn't like all the fake blood and special effects, and after a while it just gets to be a bit ridiculous, however that's what they were going for.

I recommend a rent or stream before I would recommend a purchase. Not much re-watchability besides a fun movie with some drunk friends.",1397001600,,1173,4.391705069124424

Oh and something funny, most movies like this have the female walking around topless but in this movie she almost never had panties on. So just beware.",1395532800,,424,4.182926829268292
6234321,4,B00HW3EZXQ,"Abby (Paz de la Huerta) is a nurse by day and a vamp by night. At night she lures married men into seduction and then kills them for cheating on their spouse. Abby sees young Danni (Katrina Bowden) as an apprentice. She seduces Danni, in spite of the fact Danni has a boyfriend and doesn't remember the incident. Danni quickly sees through Abby as someone who is troubled and wants out of their friendship. Abby doesn't take too kindly to the snub and it is ""Game on.""

Her make up looks odd in that she wears excessive lip stick and does nothing for her eyes.

This film is grindhouse/pulp fiction . There is plenty of blood, comedy, dark comedy, and nudity. Niecy Nash provides additional humor as a nurse who wants sex, but never gets it.

Worth a view for some laughs.

F-bombs, sex, and nudity as one might expect. Paz de la Huerta has two scenes where she walks around bottomless looking like an airbrushed manikin.",1395446400,9,921,4.497005988023952

6234323,3,B00HW3EZXQ,"""Nobody will ever understand you like I do."" Abby Russell (de la Huerta) is one of the best nurses in her hospital. She saves lives and gets along with everyone. At night she looks for cheating men, seduces them then kills them. Everything is going fine until Danni (Bowden), a young nurse, shows up. What starts off as a friendship starts to become scary for Danni and when she finds out Abby's secret it could become deadly. This is a movie where there really isn't much to say. Very predictable and generic. The deaths aren't that inventive or original and the movie really uses nudity and sex as a way to keep the viewer interested, for example during the exposition scenes Abby walks around totally bottomless. This isn't a terrible movie because I have seen worse but really this is nothing that original or exciting. Horror fans may like this but this was a little too generic for me to get totally invested in. Overall, nothing more then a nurse getting naked then killing people mixed with a totally generic story line, but who doesn't like boobs? You have to decide what aspect interests you more.

6234325,5,B00HW3EZXQ,"Several friends and myself had the privledge of catching this on demand the same time it released to theaters in 3D no less. Paz De La Huerta plays Abby Russell a nurse by day and man killer by night literally. When Danni played by Katrina Bowden a new nurse suspects that something may not be right with Abby who is mentoring Danni, thats when all hell breaks loose for Danni and those around her. Judd Nelson and Niecy Nash also show up for the fun. Blink and you might miss the cameo from Kathleen Turner as well.

An homage to 70's exploitation films, a time of some great grindhouse flicks that went balls to the wall outrageous this movie has it all. Lots of nudity, sex, gore and some of the most campy dialogue you've ever heard in a film. We were laughing and howling at the screen many times.

The film is sharp looking and filmed very well, as far as 3D goes, some of the CGI  could have been a bit better but the in your face effects sprinkled in the film do their part mainly when it comes to the gore.

I've read many reviews from those that didn't like the film and thought Paz De La Huerta's acting left a lot to be desired. People she's a sociopath and she played her role perfectly. I think those people didn't get the joke or what the film is trying to be. Those that love campy B movies and 70's exploitation will appreciate this film and will get it and will love it like we did.

This is one of those films where you get your friends together have a few drinks and just marvel and the madness on screen. It delivers in spades at what the trailer only hints at. Enjoy!!",1393545600,83,1590,4.217105263157895
6234326,1,B00HW3EZXQ,"Abby Russell is a nurse by day and a vigilante of sorts by night. She finds cheating married men, lures them with her feminine wiles, and then kills them because she considers them scum. At her day job, Danni, a new nurse that she has been mentoring, graduates, but freezes on her first day on the job. Abby has become obsessed with Danni and is angered when she goes to her boyfriend for help and comfort. Abbys solution is to take her out drinking, drug her, have random men rape her, and then rape her herself. Danni is horrified and just wants to move on with her life and forget about the horrible night. However, Abby was expecting a completely different reaction and sets out to make her life a living hell.

I had middling expectations watching Nurse 3D. I am wary of any film with 3D in the title because that means gimmicky 3D scenes that don't actually add to the story in any way, but I wasn't prepared for the true awfulness that is Nurse 3D. The story is a weird hodgepodge of a bunch of different films, namely Single White Female and Fatal Attraction. It really wants to be American Psycho, but is so off base, lacking the satire, good acting, good directing, etc. I like the storyline where Abby kills cheating men because its interesting and hasn't been done about a thousand times before like the obsession story line. Unfortunately, after the opening scene, it barely gets any mention. The kills that follow sometimes follow that formula, but are mostly focused on killing those that are hurting Danni. The only other mention is the super cheesy flashback that shows her killing her cheating father when she was a child. The Single White Female story line was frankly boring and offensive. Rape is not a great way to start a relationship with someone and those scenes were unfortunately shown as titillating and never acknowledged as rape.

Paz de la Huerta is a gorgeous woman and certainly looks the part of Abby as sexy and sultry. Unfortunately, her acting is horribly wooden. I think she was going for emotionless detachment, but it came across as simply inept. She is just trying too hard to be sexy, when she accomplishes it with little to no effort. Her voice came off as a bored phone sex operator. I really wanted to like her character, but she lacked the charisma and wit to pull it off. Her dialog is way too obvious and ham handed, with such gems as this: There was actually moisture trickling down my leg. Larry made me cum after all. Simply cringeworthy.

Nurse 3D is an awful movie. I was expecting a campy, fun, bloody film like Machete, but I got a horrible story, wooden acting, and a script that defies logic and requires a huge suspension of disbelief. To counteract its failings, loads of gratuitous female nudity are employed. If thats all the viewers are looking for, there is plenty of porn with better acting. Instead of so bad its good, this film is so bad its practically unwatchable.",1393545600,2,2932,4.602294455066922

6234330,3,B00HW3EZXQ,"I walked into this expecting something like a more seductive version of American Mary (2012).  What I got was more like a stylishly shot and scored ""Fatal Attraction to a Single White Female American Psycho"" cult film.  Complete with cheesy lines, abduction, spewing gore, an epically destructive hospital catfight, death-by-defibrillator and plenty of nudity, this will surely please lovers of shock, schlock and exploitation cinema.  This also has the production quality and star power to please those who like a stylishly different horror/slasher film from time to time.  Writer/director Douglas Aarniokoski (The Day) has done us well with his leading lady...

Meet the sultry Abigail Russell (Paz de la Huerta; Boardwalk Empire), medical professional by day and sauntering sexual sociopath by night.  Her hobbies include wearing sexy lingerie, dabbling in lesbianism, blackmailing and seducing her co-workers, and killing adulterous married men looking to two-time their wives.

Abigail works with the cute, insecure newbie Danni (Katrina Bowden) and immediately becomes obsessed with her, wanting Danni to leave her boyfriend so they can to be together.  When Danni doesn't share this whim and tries to distance herself, Abigail aims her deep-seeded instability at the people in Danni's life.

At times, Abigail is perfectly sociopathic and sexy--especially during the opening sequence which includes her narration.  But her execution sometimes walks the line between sociopathic emotional emptiness and stale acting--which I believe to be the fuel to the fire of most negative reviews.  In general, I find her flat mood appealing and it especially suits her as she obsesses over Danni.  It smacks pretty hard of Single White Female (1992) with just a culinary dash of American Psycho (2000), but she's more about sexual fixation than trying to ""become"" the object of her desire.  Abigail targets men who she perceives to have wronged Danni, along with anyone else who stands in Abigail's way.

The finale brings us a brilliant admixture of an epically brutal catfight interspersed with a punctuated killing spree that ravages a hospital staff with a staggering body count.

This movie is just plain cult film fun done well.",1392595200,,2229,5.38328530259366

It seems to establish that the nurse is targeting bad/unfaithful men, but that potential is abandoned almost immediately. We're left with a tonally odd splatter movie with hints of FATAL ATTRACTION. The lead actress seems like she's on drugs the whole time, which might help explain why she's casually naked in half her scenes. It bordered on soft-core porn, but couldn't decide whether to go all the way.
