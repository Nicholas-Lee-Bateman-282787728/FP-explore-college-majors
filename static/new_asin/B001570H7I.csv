8257642,5,B001570H7I,"This is quite simply a great piece of filmmaking - whether you're in it for the music or the documentary aspect or anything in between.  Daniel Kraus opens the world of performer / composer Ken Vandermark to the viewer as naturally as opening a door.  This is gritty and realistic - no limos, no screaming fans such as one might see in a rock music documentary.  The life of a jazz musician is not an easy one - especially one dealing in improvised and composed music that takes listeners to the edge of a pretty scary precipice and threatens to nudge them over.  Mundane day-to-day activities - checking phone messages, returning calls, arranging gigs and tour schedules - are given screen time along with the expected scenes of rehearsing and performing.  It's all part of the life of a working musician whose goals are to move himself as well as his audience and bandmates rather than to force his art into a convenient box for mass-marketing.  There's a living to be made here - but as Vandermark's friend and sometime-co-conspirator Peter Brtzmann writes in his essay, included in the DVD box, it's a Sisyphean circle that seems at times to have no end.  He also notes, wisely, `This film certainly doesn't make a young man exclaim: I want to be a (jazz) musician!'

Most of the uninterrupted performance footage on the disc is included as `deleted scenes' - it's one of those rare occasions when it's absolutely worthwhile to go through all of the extras one at a time, after the film itself is over.  After viewing the documentary, these scenes serve as a reminder of the reward of the real glory to be gained from such pursuits - the pure rush of exchange between a performer and an audience, the artistic equivalent of standing naked, physically as well as emotionally, of being examined body and soul...the sense that you've touched your listeners with your work, and that you have been touched by their response to it.

In the end, MUSICIAN is about much more than Ken Vandermark - it's about the reality of this lifestyle, the sacrifices necessary to achieve the rare prize.  Watch it if you're already a fan of this amazing Chicago-based reed player - watch it to understand what drives an artist.  Daniel Kraus has created something very special here - it shouldn't be missed.  This film was created and assembled with such care and naturalness that it makes me want to view the others in the series, even if their subjects perhaps don't interest me as much as this one - something this good can't be a fluke.",1259539200,3,2523,4.668171557562077
