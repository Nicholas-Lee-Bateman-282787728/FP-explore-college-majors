8206574,1,B000SSONPW,"Capt. Freaky thought this ""might"" be a great premise for a feature film....what I should have trusted was my own knowledge that any film reagarding subject manner of this nature couldn't be made well in 2006!  This film sucked from beginning to end.  There were no interesting story lines, no outrageous torture footage, no tense sexual scenes, it was as boring as a special on A&E.
The picture and sound quality were the worst I've seen in years, in any medium.  The acting was pretty good...considering there wasn't much to do.  I wasn't scared of these bunch of hillbilly serial killers...the women they picked were not particularly interesting.
What can I say?  This film is a total waste of money...I should have bought gold coins instead.  In ten years they'll be worth money, while this DVD is worth about $3 at my local video store's used pile!",1194480000,6,852,4.761904761904762
