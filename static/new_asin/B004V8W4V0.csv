4482171,3,B004V8W4V0,"I was looking for a copy of ""Ice Cream Man"" recently, and serendipitously discovered this three movie, two DVD set as an alternative. Although buying this package meant giving up some much more impressive packaging and DVD extras (especially in the case of ""Jack Frost 2,"") the price made it a worthwhile trade. The films vary widely in quality both conceptually and technically, with ""Ice Cream Man"" the most enjoyable, ""Killer Tongue"" the most interesting, and ""Jack Frost 2"" the weakest link in every way.

""Ice Cream Man"" is a tongue in cheek horror flick from director Paul Norman about frozen dairy products gone horribly awry. Starring the genuinely talented Clint Howard as Gregory Tudor, the film is not especially chilling. (No pun intended.) It is, however, peculiar and unique, scoring points for B-movie aficionados. Howard's performance here is totally over the top (which is interesting contrast given that a contemporary work of his was as an understated NASA flight controller in ""Apollo 13."") The film works because of Howard's hammy interpretation of the character.

The plot is fairly generic: traumatized kid grows up to be a messed up adult, who goes on a major crime spree complete with gratuitous (if totally unconvincing) violence and gore. As a child Gregory witnessed a mob hit on the local ""Ice Cream King,"" and has to be placed in the Wishing Well Hospital to help him recover from his emotional scarring. The expository dialogue ranges from the utterly contrived to hilarious puns and inside jokes. My favorite recurrent theme is from Gregory's doctor who keeps repeating the mantra ""There are no bad days Gregory, only happy days."" Obviously most of the young audience that this is intended for have no clue who Clint's brother is, or have ever heard of ""Happy Days."" Along the way there is plenty of padding and some ludicrous action: see Clint Howard dance (maybe it's better not to think too much about that,) see Clint knock over a huge display of paper towels in a dramatic flourish in a grocery store, see Clint perform an ice cream ritual in a cemetery, and much more. You get the idea. Numerous tried and true plot conventions are present and accounted for (parents don't listen to kids, etc.) while inept cops cannot solve this extremely obvious case. The real entertainment factor here relates to the hilarious and gratuitous casting decisions that never failed to amuse: while Clint is the clear star, the movie features luminaries such as Olivia Hussey (as a loopy nurse,) Doug Llewelyn (in an entertaining and brilliantly conceived cameo as a store manager,) and perfectly cast as the incompetent and irritating police detectives Lee Majors II and Jan-Michael Vincent (!) are always the last ones to understand what's going on. Before it's over even Steve Garvey shows up!

Ultimately, the collection of neighborhood children has to solve the case and take matters into their own hands with utterly predictable results. Not only is the conclusion perfectly obvious, so is the sequel bait. ""Ice Cream Man"" is a cookbook horror movie that's askew from the norm in its bizarre darkly comic details and references (the Pied Piper and very interesting puppetry chief among the eccentric directorial choices,) which makes it more enjoyable than a formulaic slasher flick. It's true that much of the acting is amateurish (except from Clint Howard, who is clearly having a ball chewing the scenery) and much of the script is uninspired, but what do you expect? It's a movie about an evil ice cream man made with a cast of children and Clint Howard. If you watch it for what it is, it's an amusing diversion and guilty pleasure for the B-movie fan in everyone.

""Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman"" is a film that also needs to be viewed in the spirit in which it was intended to achieve any kind of satisfaction for audience members. Let's get this out of the way first: it's not a horror film as much as it's an attempt at comedy, though the comedy is often meager and the production values are terrible. The concept is weaker than the original, and the acting and script are frequently poor. This is a film that, if it is to be enjoyed at all, must be viewed through the lens of the bad movie aficionado, preferably in the company of other B-movie lovers. Even then, though, this film can be a tough slog at times.

With subplots about talking carrots, fanged snowballs, shape-shifting water beings, and ice creatures that can't melt in the tropics, it's clear that this is shaky material, but it really falls down in the execution: the script is not funny, and the one-liners from the evil sentient snowman are less amusing than corny this time around. Director (and writer) Michael Cooney exploits water in all its forms (talking ice cubes, falling ice anvils, snowball waffles, etc.) to the maximum effect, but underlying the alleged hilarity is a concept that does not succeed on many levels. Here Christopher Allport is Sheriff Sam Tiler, haunted by his previous encounter with Jack Frost. In an attempt to escape his demons he takes his wife Anne (Eileen Seeley) and friends on a tropical vacation where evil talking snowmen couldn't possibly exist. Of course, you know that all is possible in B-movie comedy-dramas, and after some introductory experimentation, the melt-proof Jack Frost shows up to haunt the island. The rest of the movie revolves around defeating this indefatigable snowman (laser sighted super soakers full of antifreeze no longer hack it) and his evil snowball spawn. (The less said about the special effects, the better: the talking snowballs in particular are very challenging to take seriously as a threat, but this is comedy remember.) After much drama including the throwing of frying pans (really?) and vacuum cleaner theatrics, the CGI and puppet menace is vanquished (unless there is a ""Jack Frost 3."")

This film looks relentlessly cheap, and the video quality is terrible; the net effect is tedium interspersed with a rare giggle. Perhaps some fans of the first movie will enjoy the sequel, but from concept to final production, this is strictly enjoyable only for camp value, and even that is pretty limited.

Director Alberto Sciamma's otherworldly ""Killer Tongue"" is a comedic horror movie like no other. Made in Spain (though set in the desert southwest of the United States) as ""La Lengua Asesina,"" this freakshow is genuinely novel, and rarely fails to startle. The film opens with a ridiculous revelation (""It all started four years ago with a heist and a kiss..."") to explain the motivations of the star, Candy (Melinda Clarke.) Candy is a bad girl, who with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr) commits a robbery. While he does the time for it and is taunted by no other than Elm Street's favorite spawn Robert Englund, Candy hides out in a convent. After a meteorite possesses a bowl of soup, Candy grows a ten foot long, murderous, talking tongue (with fingers!) that makes everyone's lives extremely difficult. Along the way fluorescent poodles are transmogrified in the most outlandish way imaginable, a most unexpected dance number materializes out of nowhere, we learn why it's a bad idea to iron your tongue, there's a gratuitous lesson in diaper folding, and there is lingual surgery performed by a sabre (""Hasta maana, baby!"") To reveal more would take away from the truly surreal onscreen vision: let's just say there's nothing else like it.

The film is by no means perfect; several of the performances are stilted, the image transfer itself is quite subpar, and the script is uneven. The special effects are technically not that amazing, but they work adequately for Sciamma's needs. For a comedy this is a bit gruesome; for a horror film it's a bit heavy-handed on the comedic scale. Overall it is very interesting and definitely worth a viewing for horror fans or fans of B-movies in general, though be prepared for occasionally unexpected sleaze and a plethora of grotesqueness along the way.",1333843200,2,8000,4.938335809806835

4482173,4,B004V8W4V0,"I am not sure why ""Killer Tongue"" is in this threesome. Clearly it is out of place.

ICE CREAM MAN
The movie starts out with a black and white episode out of the 50's. An ice cream man gets shot. A child come to get ice cream is disturbed by it, and I don't know how the kid got blood on his head. Converse supplied shoes to all the kids in the film, hence all the ridiculous shoe close-ups.

We then flash to modern times. Clint Howard plays the creepy ice cream man, one that has a great nervous eye tic. His sanitation within his truck leaves much to be desired as he scoops out ice cream which include human body parts. He is clearly deranged. What makes this movie interesting are the characters who are caricatures of themselves, playing roles stereotyped by dialouge. With names like Tuna Cassera, how can you not love them. Jeanine Anderson sits in a chair and comically squawks while her Reverend husband believes she is speaking in tongues to the archangel Gabriel and doesn't understand why his daughter Heather (Anndi McAfee who does cartoon voices) runs to her room.

The movie boils down to the kids vs. the ice cream man. It is a fun movie, but not scary for adults.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. I am puzzled by the ""R"" rating.

JACK FROST 2
The movie is more comedy than slasher horror, perhaps more in the same light as ""Student Bodies."" Christopher Allport plays Sheriff Sam Tiler, who people don't believe about his killer snowman. The snowman has been revived and heads to a tropical island where Sam and his wife are vacationing. Jack Frost has the ability to change his shape. He talks the whole while, similar to the inane chatter of previously mentioned ""Student Bodies.""

The movie is fun and is more spoof on horror than horror itself. There is blood, killing, and some Troma style gore. A killer snow ball fight.

F-bomb, nudity (Kerri V. Griffin)

KILLER TONGUE
This is a comedy-cult horror that misses on all cylinders. A space meteor/alien lands in soup as ""boring as nuns"" that is ingested by a woman (Melinda Clarke). She is taken over by an alien tongue and her 4 pet poodles are turned into flaming homosexuals (I didn't write this.). She is awaiting her boyfriend to get out of a Mexican prison, where Robert Englund appears to be the only guard. The movie lacks in horror. The dialouge is bad and lacks the humor and style needed to create a cult plot.

F-bomb, adult situations, no nudity",1325376000,3,2425,4.543577981651376
4482174,4,B004V8W4V0,"ICE CREAM MAN: This movie is the Citizen Kane of cheesy B horror movies. There are so many weird or creepy things about the movie that you can't help but be entertained. It's about a crazed ice cream man who leaves an asylum, chops up kids and puts them in his ice cream. But there is so much more.

The cast is insane! You've got Clint Howard as a serial killing ice cream man, Lee Majors II and Jan Michael Vincent as a couple of Miami Vice clones, Baseball Hall of Famer Steve Garvey(!), Sandahl Bergman, David Naughton and British actor David Warner as well as Olivia Hussey, who played one of the most famous versions of Juliet in film history!

  There are so many goofs and mistakes in this movie you'd have to watch it twice to count them all. There are fake plants in an outdoor garden, a fat kid, named Tuna, who is only fat because he wears an obvious fat suit, some of the most fake blood you'll ever laugh at, and jarring switches between the horror, comedy and even almost, kinda family film genres.  The acting is indescribable.

  This is a fantastic film for the b horror movie fan.

JACK FROST 2: Jack Frost 2 is cool! (Ha-ha get it?) I can't say enough about how entertaining this movie is. If Ice Cream Man is the Citizen Kane of b horror movies, then Jack Frost 2 is the Casablanca or Gone with the Wind. Basically, the killer from the original gets re-formed (Go Science!) and is off on a revenge spree against the sheriff who put him on ice in the first movie. The fact that that sheriff is now on vacation in the Caribbean doesn't slow Jack down in the least.

  This was obviously made by b horror fans who were aiming at giving the audience everything they could want in a cheesy horror movie. I won't spoil any of the surprises for you but just let me say that if you liked the original, or if you just like movies that are so bad they're good, then you'll love Jack Frost 2.

THE KILLER TONGUE: aka LA LENGUA ASESINA: This black comedy/horror involves a woman hiding out with four poodles in the desert with the loot from a heist while her boy friend is stuck in jail. A meteorite crashes near the station transforming the woman into an alien being with a gigantic voracious tongue and her poodles into four drag queens!? It gets even weirder when her boy friend escapes from prison and also runs into the meteorite, as does a mute nun who is morphed into a sexy drum majorette. I couldn't believe what I was watching. I will say that it's a pretty bizarre and crazy good time, and that Melinda Clarke should be a bigger star.",1305763200,12,2554,4.329140461215933

8443060,3,B004V8W4V0,"This Mill Creek triple feature comes as 2 discs. Jack Frost 2 and Killer Tongue share a double-sided disc, while Ice Cream has its own disc. These movies were also previously released on DVD by Ardustry. The Ardustry and Mill Creek releases share the same transfers and sound mixes. I own Killer Tongue and Jack Frost 2 from Ardustry, and the PQ looks the same. I expect the same case for Ice Cream Man. The only real difference is Jack Frost 2 has some nice extras on the Ardustry release (none of the movies in this triple feature have extras). I see Mill Creek also offers these as standlones, and I expect those to be the same discs featured in this triple feature.

Watching on my PC, all 3 films have aliasing, aka the ""comb effect"", due to some interlacing/deinterlacing issue. You're results may vary depending on your player and what setting you use. Jack Frost 2 is presented in anamorphic widescreen, and has by far the best PQ. Ice Cream Man and Killer Tongue are fullscreen, the latter featuring some of the worst PQ put to DVD. It's like a transfer of a 10th generation VHS tape, uploaded to Youtube in 2004. If you're a fan of the movie, I've read that it has a much more appealing release by Warner Bros. in Spain, though I don't know how to track it down.

I purchased this triple feature hoping for 3 things: 1) At least a slight improvement in quality for Killer Tongue compared to my old Ardustry DVD. 2) I would pick up Jack Frost 2 with all the features from the Ardustry release (at the time, I hadn't purchased it yet). 3) I would enjoy Ice Cream Man (I'd never seen it before), thus making it a nice bonus. Unfortunately, none of those things came to be. But if you're not too concerned with extras and PQ, I would recommend it at the current $5 price, mainly for Jack Frost 2 and possibly Killer Tongue. Jack Frost 2 is a fun, funny little movie. Killer Tongue is a weird one, but also a little fun. Ice Cream Man I might've enjoyed if I were a kid, as it features children as the heroes, unfortunately I found it entirely boring.",1398211200,,2056,4.37958115183246
