A total Must HAVE for your Home DVD collection.",1283904000,,308,4.368421052631579
8409281,5,B003YHB7K8,"By hook or by crook, you've got to take a look -- at Staar.

She is a complete, unique original who will show how she achieved her well-deserved status and title of ""Mistress of the Universe"",
And she provides tips for us staary-eyed pretenders along the way. I have shown this movie many, many times, and it never fails to
mesmerize every audience. It's suitable for any occasion (except maybe for your four year old's next birthday party.)
It's simply HOT, HOT, HOT",1283904000,,467,4.626506024096385
8409282,5,B003YHB7K8,"Follow the money and FOLLOW STAAR!!!  So witty, so irreverent, so FUN! This is an eye pleasing joy harkening back to the days of burlesque and the playfulness and wit of the greats like Mae West.  An unusual film that provides an unusually good time.
You are guarnateed to enjoy every frame of Staar's frame.",1283817600,,308,4.581818181818182
8409283,5,B003YHB7K8,"I've seen this film a few times and it always makes me laugh.  Yes, it's funny but director and lead actress also offer a societal commentary on the privledged class and the games that they play.  They remind us once again that while money may not buy happiness, it sure makes life a lot more fun!
See the film.",1283817600,,311,4.254237288135593
8409284,5,B003YHB7K8,"I sat down to watch this movie with a few friends. I heard my husband chuckling from the other room. He couldn't keep away. He came and watched it with us. We enjoyed the musical numbers and the lead character, Staar. She puts a huge smile on our faces. We can't wait to see what she does next. Is there a sequel?",1283212800,,313,4.064516129032258
