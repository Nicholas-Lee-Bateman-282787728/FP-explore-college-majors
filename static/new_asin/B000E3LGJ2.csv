8105193,4,B000E3LGJ2,"I don't know if I'll manage to see the entire series, but the third volume of ""Viewtiful Joe"" is much more interesting and funny than Vol. 2. This one's got ""Pokemon""-like creatures that kids love, which can attach themselves to their brains and make them into devil children. I don't know, is the irony there plain enough? Anyway, yeah. That's really what goes on in this one.",1211068800,2,377,4.641791044776119
