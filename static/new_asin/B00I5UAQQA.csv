8639496,2,B00I5UAQQA,"This DVD looks like it was done by an amateur. The subtitle font is also bad. Seasons 3 and 4 on blue ray was expertly done and is great, buy those. You can watch seasons 1 and 2 on the internet in 720p with subtitles done by fans that are of amazing quality. Skip this DVD until they come out with a blue ray. This will be on my shelf untill a blue ray comes out only because of my love of this show. Unbelievable.",1495497600,,415,3.8941176470588235
8639497,5,B00I5UAQQA,"I rated this anime base on my experience from watching the whole 4 seasons. Yes, this is a very good anime that I would like to own. BUT why NIS why.. did you release seasons 1 and 2 in freaking DVDs where as the rest of seasons 3 and 4 are in Blu-ray??? Who wants to own DVD in the 2010's especially when the last 2 seasons are released in Blu-ray and most TV sets are now in 1080p or 4K? This is a huge mistake and miss sales opportunities.
I am pretty damn sure that there are many fan/people like me that hold on to purchasing this wonderful series because of what a lame collection it will be that half are DVD and the other half are Blu-ray. Please re-release season 1 and 2 in Blu-ray and I can assure you that this series will sell ways better than what it is now.",1477180800,6,772,4.01948051948052

8639499,5,B00I5UAQQA,Awesome story and art. The only drawback is that the DVDs come stacker on each other instead of having individual slots on the case,1454630400,,131,4.5
8639500,5,B00I5UAQQA,This is a series I can watch again & again. I'm so glad I was able to get the first 2 season so cheap. I hope I'll be able to complete the collection soon enough.,1454371200,,162,3.657142857142857
8639501,5,B00I5UAQQA,"One of my top favorite anime of all time, ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" or ""Natsume's Book of Friends"" is a bittersweet slice of life story of a high school boy, Takashi Natsume (first name, last name) who has the ability to see ""youkai"" or ""demons,"" and has been passed from relative to relative (sometimes not even a relative) throughout his life and shunned by his peers, teachers, and guardians alike because of this ability. At the start of this anime, Natsume has been living with his current guardians for about a month and has, by this point, learned to hide his supernatural ability from the people around him. This story follows his various encounters with youkai - both peaceful and power-hungry - and other humans, and his gradually growing trust and happiness in his current situation.

This specific DVD set contains the seasons 1 & 2 of the series. The Natsume Yuujinchou anime has a total of 4 seasons. This DVD set has 26 episodes total, each season taking up 2 DVDs - for a total of 4 DVDs in this set. Audio is Japanese ONLY. THIS IS NOT A DUB. Subtitles are in English. All four DVDs come in a single DVD case, stacked one-on-top-of-the-other (as opposed to other American DVD cases designed like a book with one DVD per ""page""; not fanned out like ""The Lord of the Rings"" Extended Edition DVD set). The case is sturdy and holds all 4 DVDs with no issue. The green pamphlet shown in the product picture is a folded sheet of paper listing the episodes with short summaries, and is found on the inside of the DVD case (where you would normally find promotion codes, advertisements, etc.).

These DVDs are set for Region 1 format - meaning U.S.A. region format. Japan's region format is Region 2.

Overall, a very good addition to my collection. I highly recommend it.",1453161600,9,1776,4.631746031746032

8639503,5,B00I5UAQQA,"This is an excellent anime show, and I would give this show a 5 star rating, and I'm shocked not many anime fans like myself, have not heard of this series.  As for the seller, I got what I wanted, which was a new ""Natsume's Book of Friends"" season 1 and 2, at a good price. So I would give the seller a 5 star rating also.",1431388800,,323,3.8208955223880596
