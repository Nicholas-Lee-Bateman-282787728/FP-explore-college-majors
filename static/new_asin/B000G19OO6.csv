8304298,4,B000G19OO6,"The producer, Lenny Magill, makes the same comment in the introduction on the DVD that is in the editorial review, that most law enforcement officers who are shot, are shot with their own gun.  As has already been pointed out, that's simply untrue.  You'd think someone making videos of this nature would bother to check the facts before making such statements.  After hearing this statement in the intro, I was worried about the quality of the material on the DVD, but my worries were unfounded.  The retention techniques are presented and demonstrated by 25 year martial arts instructor Barry Barker, not by Mr. Magill, and Mr. Barker does an outstanding job.  Mr. Magill does do spot takes in between demonstrations, which do a decent job of applying the techniques to both concealed carry and law enforcement.  He also occasionally interrupts Mr. Barker during the demonstrations for questions or amplifying remarks, presumably in an effort to make the material more applicable to the audience envisioned for the video.  He is sometimes successful in those efforts, but at times his interruptions are simply annoying.  I suppose some pre-planning or rehearsal may have minimized such annoyances, but on the other hand I have to say that the extemporaneous nature of the presentation gave it a freshness that I really liked.  In any case, the blatant factual mistake and the interruptions are the only reason I didn't give it a fifth star.  The techniques presented, and the way in which they were presented, were great.  They were common sense, not overly technical or difficult for anyone to perform regardless of skill level, and they were easily applicable to just about any day to day defense scenario one might typically imagine.  You don't need to be some kind of Rambo/ninja to understand or use these techniques.  They even include disarming techniques for you to use if the bad guy does manage to get your gun during a struggle.  The production quality is also excellent.  I would definitely recommend these videos (plural because there are actually 2 DVDs instead of the 1 that the description states).",1349827200,2,2116,5.005714285714285
8304299,1,B000G19OO6,"Most ""police officers"" are NOT killed with their own handguns.  According to the statistics gathered by the FBI on a yearly basis, it's usually more like 10 percent are killed with their own handguns.  So sadly, the marketing angle on this is completely skewed and incorrect.  Apparently anybody can make a video, throw a few zombie grabs and martial arts moves in there, and all of a sudden they are an expert on the topic.",1332720000,2,424,4.626666666666667
