1075121,5,6305710449,"The best semi-final King of the Ring matches were at KOR 2000.  Howard Finkle vs. the Fabulous Moolah and Evad Sullivan vs. the Repo Man. Evad and The Fink advance and tear each other open, and the Fink wins due to the interferance of the Genius.
The best Hell in the Cell match was also on  the card as IC Champ Jim Duggan took on Stephanie McMahon defending the  honor of her new husband Bastion Booger. Duggan did his classic run at  Stephanie with the 2X4 shouting ""HOOOOO"" and Stephanie took this  as an insult and laid Duggan out with some Sweet Chin Music reclaiming the  IC title from Dooogan.
The lumberjack match between the Ultimate Warrior  and Papa Shango was missing one lumberjack and suddenly from the rafters  came down Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake saying that he always  wanted to be a lumberjack leaping from tree to tree....The match went on  and Beefcake caused Warrior to lose as he cursed Warrior and cause black  good to get into his eyes. Then he took off his uniform revealing he was  really The Big Brother and then he transformed again showing he was truly  The Butcher, and the Zodiac Man, and also the Booty Man.
A hair match  took place against Shawn Michaels and Bull Nokano, as Nokano lost her hair  and Michael did also, as Michaels used Nokano's hair as a foreign object  and was DQed.
And the special handicap match as Crush, Harley Race,  Vader, The Macho King, Mr. T, Sensational Sherri, Taz, RVD, and Dean  Douglas take on Tony Schiavone and Alundra Blayze, who turns on him, in a  fall brawl cage match on loan from WCW.
The WWF title match featured the  great Al Snow against his long time rival Made in the USA the Iron Sheik  with his manager Bob Backlund suspened high in a steel cage with a rabid  Bret Hart.
My favourite match of the night was the European ladder match  between Yokozuna and the Earthquake Avalanche Shark John Tenta that lasted  for 40 minutes and went through 13 ladders and left two holes in the ring,  which had to be patched quickly for the other matches, I can't tell you the  winner for this you just have to see it to believe it as Luna, Bam Bam  Bigelow, Stevie Richards, and Gene ""The Giant Killer"" Okerlund  all get involved.
This PPV was spellbinding, probably since there were no  matches with the Rock or Jericho, proving that 2000 is the year of  wrestling.",956361600,6,2335,4.5035799522673035
1075242,5,6305710449,"The tournament starts off with Benoit VS Rikishi. On Thrusday, Rikishi beat Benoit for the IC title. While it made for a good storyline, the match was short and Beniot got disqualified. A very intense match but short and basically a throwaway match.

Eddie Guerrero VS Val Venis: A back and fourth contest with Venis winning in a surprise win. I thought Chyna's interference would ruin it but it couldn't take away from a good match.

Pat Patterson is picking out dresses. Ugh

Crash Holly (RIP) VS Bull Buchanan: This match is a basic Spike Dudley speical from the original ECW. Buchanan looks impressive as he beats up Crash for the entire match. Then out of nowhere, Crash rolls him up and its over.

Kurt Angle VS Chris Jericho: Angle cuts a funny promo about Boston sports and how they all suck, this was only a few short years before they started winning it all. I'll say it again, Angle with hair was funny and good do a great promo. Without hair, he is just intense and serious. Jericho comes out and calls him Kirk Angel, hahaha. This was a excellent back and fourth encounter, much like Venis-Guererro. However, Steph comes in to interfere and she hits Angle with the belt by mistake and Jericho kisses her. Angle hits an Olympic slam and wins. A good match ruined by a dumb ending. The first round ends.

Edge and Christian VS T @ A VS Hardy Boyz VS Too Cool: Edge and Christian do there awesome 5 second pose before the match, making me miss the glory days of WWE. Lawler fawns over Too Cool because his son is Grandmasta Sexay. It's a rare treat to see Too Cool hold the belts and I know they won't walk out with the belts. I was right as Edge and Christian won back the tag team belts in a entertaining match.

Venis VS Rikishi: Anther Rikishi match that could have been suited as a hardcore match. A good, short match with a very quick ending. Did they run out of time?

Crash VS Angle: The Cinderella story is over because there is no chance in hell Crash could go over Angle. It was an enjoyable, short match with Angle winning in the end.

Evening Gown Hardcore Match between Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco and I skip it. Why the hell would I want to watch these old farts in drag wrestle?

D-X VS Dudley Boyz: I would have prefered Tori being left out of this match because she offers nothing to the match. This match was plain stupid and the ending sucked. Tori gets put a thru a table by Dudley afterwards.

Angle VS Rikishi for the King of the Ring title: Rikishi was pretty impressive thru out the entire tournament and Angle is always golden, espeically this era. Anther good 'Kishi match and he almost wins the entire tournament. Angle wins with an awesome belly to belly suplex from the top rope and wins the King of the Ring.

Shane and Vince McMahon and Triple H VS Kane, Undertaker, and The Rock: A great main event with alot going on. Rock pins Vince with the rock bottom to win back his world title. Undertaker choke slams Shane from the top rope thru the annoucers table is one of the cool spots in this match.

Overall, Rikishi puts on a great showing but comes up short. The only matches I didn't care for were Dudley Boyz-DX and Patterson-Briscoe matches. It's a must own for WWF fans who hate the current product.",1245196800,,3250,4.416387959866221
1075243,3,6305710449,"The only memorable thing I can recall from this King of the Ring was Kurt Angle becoming the new King of the Ring. Everything else just turned out to be decent or below average. To include this being the first and only time at a King of the Ring event that the WWE title was contested in a Six Man Tag Team match.

King of the Ring Quarter-Final Matches
Rikishi vs. Chris Benoit
3 days earlier on Smackdown, Rikishi and Benoit had a match where Rikishi won the Intercontinental title from Benoit. And ironically that match was far better then this one. After about 4 or 5 minutes of wrestling Benoit gets himself DQ'ed. This is a bad match. Which you rarely say about any Benoit match. 2.25/5

Val Venis vs. Eddie Guerrero
Best match of the Quarter-Finals. Val and Eddie performed very well. Some good quality action from this match. One of the better matches of the night. 4.25/5

Crash Holly vs. Bull Buchanan
This match did nothing for me. Crash gets the slick roll up on Bull for the win. 2.5/5

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho
Not their best confrontation. You would see better matches from these two later on in their careers. But this is still one of the better matches of the night. A very good quarter-final match. The ending with Stephanie McMahon would only continue the feud between Triple H & Chris Jericho. 4/5

WWE Tag Team Championship
Too Cool vs. Edge & Christian vs. T&A vs. Hardy Boys
Much better match then I anticipated it to be. The Hardys and E&C in my view kept this match fun and interesting to watch. The last two teams has a good match showing too. Certainly better then what you think it will be. 4/5

King of the Ring Semi-Final Matches
Rikishi vs. Val Venis
These two had a feud going on already that would eventually end next month at Fully Loaded in a Steel Cage match. The match got physical at times but really nothing special. Rikishi takes a hard shot with the steel steps after the match. And also a chair shot to his already injured arm. 3/5

Kurt Angle vs. Crash Holly
Even though I'm a huge fan of Kurt's, this match didn't cut it for me either. A decent match at best. 2.5/5

Evening Gown Match for the Hardcore Championship
Pat Patterson vs. Gerald Brisco
I really have nothing to say about this match. That's how bad this match is. You even get some BORING chants in this one. Wrestlecrap at its best. Not even Crash Holly coming out to recapture his Hardcore title could save this one. 0.5/5

Table/Dumpster Match
Dudley Boyz vs. Road Dogg, Tori, & X-Pac
The rules to this match was that the Dudleys had to put all 3 members of DX through a table and for DX to win they had to put the Dudley boys into the dumpster and close the lid. I didn't find this match all that good. A couple of good table spots and thats about it. 3.5/5

King of the Ring Finals
Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi
Some very nice slams in this match. Rikishi for sure was selling his injured arm. I found this match pretty enjoyable to watch. The belly to belly from the top rope to Rikishi was pretty impressive. With this victory, everybody knew that Kurt Angle was the real deal. 4/5

WWE Championship
The Rock, Undertaker, & Kane vs. Triple H, Mr. McMahon, & Shane McMahon
Nothing much was happening here. Of course the team of Rock, Taker, & Kane turned on each other. Kane even chokeslamming the Rock at one point, tombstoning Triple H, then taking a chair shot by Taker. Shane takes a chokeslam from the top rope through the announce table by the Undertaker which was the real highlight of the match. A dull main event to say the least but it's worth seeing. 4/5

If you can find this somewhere to rent or even at a low price to purchase, then I recommend getting this. But take it into recognition that this isn't the best King of the Ring event.",1234310400,,3758,4.39136690647482
1075244,2,6305710449,"Frying toilet paper is kind of fun, and you sort of look forward to it, because it's something you haven't done in a long time.  Just like this PPV, because I used to watch the WWF in the 2000s-2001, and now am watching the WWE again these days since 2004.  But this PPV... just like frying toilet paper... was a huge letdown.  And I didn't get to eat the DVD after I was done with it.

KOTR Quarterfinals
Rikishi vs NO ONE
This match sucked.  PERSON WHO DOES NOT EXIST, who is usually a great technical wrestler, just sucked here, and Rikishi sucked as well.  So much sucking was going on, my lollipop was gone before I could taste it.  If that makes any sense...  Anyway, GUY WHO NEVER EXISTED got disqualified for a cheap win for Rikishi.  (0/10)

KOTR Quarterfinals match
Eddie Guerrero vs Val Venis
Val Venis was just awful.  Eddie Guerrero did his best, but Val had nothing to offer.  He's a relic of the 1998-1999 Attitude era, and is badly out of place in 2000.  Someone just retire him, before his shows up ag---OH NO HE'S ON WWE TV!!!  Seriously, though, this match was pretty awful.  (4/10)

KOTR Quarterfinal match
Crash Holly vs Bull Buchanan
There's a running theme here, isn't there?  Do I even need to review this one?  I'll spare you much by saying it's a major suckfest, in which Bull dominates Crash the entire match, and suddenly Crash picks up the pinfall for who-knows-what-reason, even though Bull kind of... sort of... kicked out before the three.  But just like the Wrestlemania 2000 Hardcore Battle Royal, Crash Holly is beyond logic.  (0/10)

KOTR Quarterfinals
Kurt Angle vs Chris Jericho
This should have been a good match.  Should have.  Much in the same way the Wrestlemania 2000 triple threat match for both of Angle's championships should have been a good match.  But it just wasn't.  Why?  Because of what is most popular in WWE matches these days, and apparently back then in this event: lots and lots of fake punching and kicking and stomping, generic brawler moves like clotheslines and shoulderblocks, and not a lot of real wrestling or exciting moves.  (3/10)

Four Team Elimination match for the WWF Tag Team Championship
Edge and Christian vs The Hardy Boyz vs T&A vs Too Cool (C)
Ah, fun!  Yes, this was a good match.  In these days, the tag team division was at its best, with the likes of Too Cool, the Hardys, and Edge and Christian.  T&A sucked, but no one really noticed because they were eliminated first.  There was nothing really special with regards to spots, but it was fun.  (7/10)

KOTR Semifinals match
Val Venis vs Rikishi
This is the point where you realize that frying your toilet paper isn't going to get any more fun, despite that last batch of fun you had.  Rikishi's working too hard this night... his performance is suffering, and all he seems to be wanting to do is stink face and bonzai drop.  (0/10)

KOTR Semifinals match
Kurt Angle vs Crash Holly
This sort of match is the equivalent of Mike Awesome vs Mideon.  If you're asking, ""Who's Mideon?"", exactly.  I don't even remember what happened.  I do remember that Crash sucked badly, and got pinned.  But otherwise, what happened?  No one really knows.  Everyone just sort of passes out when the bell rings.  (0/10)

Evening Gown Match for WWF Hardcore Championship
Gerald Brisco vs Pat Patterson (C)
A zero rating does no justice to just how awful this is.  These two men are unbelievably ugly in evening gowns, and there is no fighting but mock catfighting, and Crash Holly showing up to snatch the title.  (0/10)

Tables and Dumpster Match
The Dudley Boys vs Road Dogg and X-Pac and Tori
The stipulation is to win, the Dudleys have to put all the members of the opposite team through tables, and DX has to put the Dudleys in a dumpster and shut it closed.  This match, simple as it was in action and execution, ends up being the best match of the night, just like Wrestlemania 2000 Triangle Ladder Match, with just about everything that was good about the WWF's midcard.  (10/10)

KOTR Finals
Kurt Angle vs Rikishi
By this time, we've seen these two in so many matches tonight that no one really cares about the match.  Sure, the crowd is shrieking when Rikishi nearly gets the pin, and booing Angle, but no one really cared about the match.  It was all of six minutes of what the WWE does best these days.  (1/10)

Six Man Tag Team Match for WWF Championship
The Rock and Kane and The Undertaker vs Triple H (C) and Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon
This match was horribly executed.  Since Vince and Shane aren't heavyweight wrestlers like everyone else, Triple H had to do most of the work, while Vince and Shane get beaten down, and Kane and The Undertaker decide to fight each other.  Aside from a high spot of The Undertaker chokeslamming Shane from the top turnbuckle into the announcer's table, this one was dull as trying to eat the DVD afterwards.  (5/10)

So if you love frying toilet paper, you might like this event, but it entirely depends on if you even like wrestling.  The worst part: you can eat fried toilet paper, but you can't eat this DVD",1194480000,,5079,4.571587125416205
1075245,3,6305710449,"Another old WWF PPV that I found in a tape box.  What I can remember most about this PPV was that it was the crowning of King Kurt as Kurt Angle's successful rookie year continued.  Besides that, this was nothing more than an average PPV with not many memorable highlights.

Rikishi vs. Chris Benoit - What's funny is that they gave away this match earlier in the week on SmackDown with Rikishi winning the Intercontinental Title & that was the better match than this one as this was real short with Benoit getting himself DQ'd.  This was a real bad match...which you rarely say when it involves Benoit.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Val Venis - This was better than expected as it had a good performance by both men.

Crash vs. Bull Buchanan - These two just didn't mesh well but it's watchable as it didn't drag on for a long time.

Chris Jericho vs. Kurt Angle - Normally, these two put on classics but this match was just good given that they didn't have alot of time to tell a story.  One of the best matches of the night.

Tag Team Champions Too Cool vs. Edge & Christian vs. T&A vs. Hardy Boyz - Good match here as well as it wasn't the usual cluster that these 4 team matches are.  One thing to check out though it the comedic ""5 sec. pose"" with E&C before the match.

Kurt Angle vs. Crash - Another match that was better than expected but there wasn't much to it past that.

Rikishi vs. Val Venis - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches where it wasn't about having a good match but keeping a storyline going in which Rikishi won but this match was real quick with Val Venis once again delivering a beating to Rikishi at the end.

Evening Grown Match: Hardcore Champion Pat Patterson vs. Gerald Brisco - This was suppost to be a comedic match but it just came off flat as the crowd started chanting boring & booing before Crash came out & won back his Hardcore Title.  Wrestlecrap at it's best.

Table/Dumpster Match: This match didn't measure up to the WM14 dumpster match or any other previous table match involving the Dudley Boyz.  It was nice & watchable with some good spots at times but the real highlight was the end when the Dudleys finally got their hands on Tori & put her through the table.

Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi - Good for what it was but it was real short & Rikishi selling the arm injury he's had all night before being overcome to Kurt Angle.

WWF Champion Triple H, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon vs. The Rock, Undertaker, Kane - Good six man tag as you always get some comedic spots whenever Vince is involved along with the opponets selling the fact that they want the pinfall to become the WWF Champion.

Overall, this King Of The Ring was overall filled with good matches (except for 3 but they were kept short) but there really wasn't anything memorable here past Kurt Angle winning the King Of The Ring.

This was a very good match. It had a very good pace and both competitors perform very well. This is another great Eddie match. Rest in Peace Eddie!8 out of 10.

5.4 team elimination match

Edge and Christian vs. Too Cool vs. T and A vs. Hardy Boyz (WWF Tag Team Championship Match)

***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***
King of the Ring Quarter-Finals
Rikishi vs. Chris Benoit
---This was actually getting really good before Benoit decided he was too good for the Tournament and got DQ'd.  Sure, the royalty aspect was silly, but now Rikishi is an underdog.  Only one underdog has won the KOTR (Bret Hart in 1993).  Savio Vega lost in '95, Jake Roberts in '96, and Rikishi probably will lose here.  Let's see later if I'm right.
""5.0 out of 10"" (a good 4 minutes while it lasted)

Eddie Guerrero vs. Val Venis
---I'm surprised how much I liked this one.  Guerrero and Venis had great in-ring chemistry here.  The match was well-paced, and features some nice suplexes and reversals.  Interference from Chyna and Trish Stratus was good fun too.  My favorite match of the PPV.
""8.0 out of 10""

Crash Holly vs. Bull Buchanan
---This match didn't do it for me.  I never bought Crash Holly as a performer, and I probably never will.  He's gutsy and resilient, but that's not enough for me.  Buchanan was much better than he ever got credit for, but he didn't get to do much here.  Mediocre at best.
""4.0 out of 10""

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho
---Everyone was anticipating this one, since these two had great matches at NO WAY OUT and WRESTLEMANIA.  I thought this was a downgraded version of what we'd seen before, but it's still a very solid technical showdown.
""7.5 out of 10""

Elimination Match for the Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian vs. T&A vs.
The Hardy Boyz vs. Too Cool (champions)
---After E/C delivered another hilarious 5-second pose, we got to see one of the night's best matches.  T&A were good as the powerhouses they were, while The Hardyz and E/C were resilient and risk-takers as usual.  Too Cool, a team I rarely liked, actually weren't too bad here.  My only problem is that hey didn't do anything until it was down to 2 teams.  Still, a very solid fast-paced Elimination Match.
""7.5 out of 10""

King of the Ring Semi-Finals
Rikishi vs. Val Venis
---Easily the better of the two Semi-Final matches.  Venis and Rikishi always fought very stiff, just like their FULLY LOADED Steel Cage Match the next month.  Too bad Venis ruined the ending like Benoit did by ambushes Rikishi after their good match.  Well, let's see if underdog Rikishi still has a shot.
""7.0 out of 10""

Crash Holly vs. Kurt Angle
---Angle was in good form here, as he always is, and Crash was a little better here.  His wily tactics weren't enough for the Gold Medalist, but at least Angle was refined enough to give us as good a show as possible.
""5.0 out of 10""

Evening Gown Match for the Hardcore Championship
Gerald Brisco vs. Pat Patterson (champion)
---This is one of the most bizarre matches in WWF/WWE history, especially for a Hardcore Title match.  I'm not sure who's idea it was, but I actually found this one to be very funny.  It's not a good match, but one had to admire the balls (or stupidity) of veterans Brisco and Patterson.  Crash Holly kind of ruined the ending for me, but his 24/7 advantage was a nice twist.
""6.0 out of 10"" (most will rate it lower)

3-On-2 Handicap Table/Dumpster Match
D-Generation X vs. The Dudley Boyz
---DX had to win a Dumpster Match, while The Dudleyz were wrestling a Table Match.  Whoever could get the job done first would be the victors.  This a good match with some nice moves, plus nothing feels fake here, except for maybe Tori's finish.  What's missing was a classic spot or two.  The overall match was very good, but it could've used an ""Oh My God"" moment.
""7.0 out of 10""

King of the Ring Finals Match
Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi
---Well, did Rikishi pull it off?  No, unfortunately he maintains that underdogs rarely win Tournaments.  However, he did put up one hell of a fight!  I actually thought he won with his sit-down pin, but Angle kicked out of nowhere.  Surprise moments like false finish made this a very good KOTR Finals Match.  I wish the coronation ceremony would've occurred tonight, instead of the following RAW.  After all, we did sit through an 8-Man Tournament.  Regardless, Rikishi and Angle did themselves proud tonight.
""7.5 out of 10""

WWF Championship
Shane and Vince McMahon & Triple H (champion)
vs. Kane, The Undertaker, & The Rock
---Now this is a huge disappointment!  What a slow Tag Team match!  Not to mention that The Rock and Triple H were competing for the WWF Title for the 4th PPV in a row!  And the title switched for the 3rd month in a row...without Triple H actually being pinned.  Vince McMahon was pinned...how hard was that?  Kane was not in good form here, and could've been better.  The Undertaker was fine but didn't have much to work with except his new image (which only goes so far).  The Rock was up to his usual antics, which rarely entertained me back in 1999-2000.  Shane McMahon and Vince cheated a lot, but big surprise there!  Yes, I get the joke that they're not great wrestlers, but it's only so funny for so long.  Now the final minutes of the match are chaotic and very good, but the 20-minute buildup brought so many yawn-inducing situations that I just stopped caring.  What a dull main event!
""3.0 out of 10""

The DVD Extras include the same ""match backgrounds"" that you see in the PPV.  However, it also gives a good background on when the King of the Ring Tournament started with 16 wrestlers.  But seeing how the end turned out, I gotta say that I narrowed the winner to 3 of them advanced to the Semi-Finals.
I felt this PPV kept toying with me and saying ""It's gonna get better, we're giving you a little taste for now...""  Well, there was some good stuff, but it ultimately made no difference in WWF/WWE history.  I'm giving this 3 stars because there's no 2.5, and what's here is good enough...just not for a purchase.",1122076800,6,6128,4.488181818181818

Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi was not as good as Angle vs. Jericho but this was good also and it was cool when Angle suplexed Rikishi off the top rope.

Kane, Undertaker & The Rock vs. Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon & Triple H was a good match but not as good as the first 2.  The Rock wins the title thanks to Taker wh saved Rock's pin cover.

The Hardcore Evening Gown match was kind of hilarious and awful. It was so awful I rather see The Fabulous Moolah & Mae Young wrestle in a Bra & panties match. King of the Ring was not a good night for Rikishi because he had to wrestle 3 men with a bad shoulder and they all took advantage of the situation by using steel chairs & steel steps. The 6 man tag main event was an excitng match. The best moment of that night was seeing Undertaker drivng Shane Mcmahon through the announcer table.

Instead we got a boring predictable tourney, because of the three that had a chance, two are eliminated in the first round. Good tourney matches include: Angle vs. Jericho (possibly the match of the night) and Guerrero vs. Venis. The rest were average and predictable, if not boring.
 The rest of the card was rather lame.  The four corners Tag Title match was a standard affair, nothing special. It was above a RAW match, but not great.

It will not directly give away who wins any of the other matches but the winner may seem pretty obvious by my explanations of the matches.
( Match Reviews )
--- King of the Ring Tournament Quarterfinals Match - Chris Benoit Vs Rikishi ---
Well Benoit gave Rikish an impressive german suplex and that's basically all you need to know about this match as it was cut short because Benoit turned into a chair swinging maniac and got disqualified. The after math also contained a cool headbutt over a bunch of referee's. (2/10)
--- King of the Ring Tournament Quarterfinals Match - Val Venis Vs Eddie Guerrero ---
This match contained some high impact, a couple of submissions, good wrestling, a little bit of high flying and a quite a lot of kick outs. A overall good match however the ending seemed rushed and came out of nowhere. (5.5/10)
--- King of the Ring Tournament Quarterfinals Match - Crash Vs Bull Buchanan ---
Bull gave Crash some high impact moves as Buchanan was in control of this match for more then 90 percent of the time, Crash still somehow won this match with an upset victory. (1.5/10)
--- King of the Ring Tournament Quarterfinals Match - Kurt Angle Vs Chris Jericho ---
A good paced match complete with suplexes, top rope maneuvers and just overall good action. The match went into the crowd for a short period of time as well. (5.5/10)
--- Four-Team Elimination Match for the WWF Tag Team Championships - Too Cool Vs Edge and Christian Vs T&A Vs The Hardy Boyz ---
A greatly paced and entertaining match-up. The actions stays consistently well in this match, the first two falls are pretty cool and well done however the third and deciding fall is very poor. (6/10)
--- King of the Ring Tournament Semifinals Match - Rikishi Vs Val Venis ---
This is a short , slow paced and boring match. Rikishi gets another after match beating. (1/10)
--- King of the Ring Tournament Semifinals Match - Crash Vs Kurt Angle ---
This was an ok, semi-fast paced match with a clean ending, however like all the king of the ring matches in this pay per view(ppv) it was to short. If the lengths of these king of the ring matches where longer the rating probably would be quite a bit higher. (3.5/10)
---  Evening Gown Match for the WWF Hardcore Championship - Pat Patterson Vs Gerald Brisco ---
This was a disgusting, non-hardcore, terrible match. I was so relieved when Crash interfered and ended this match when he did. This was a waste of time that could've been used to make the king of the ring matches a bit longer. If The King did not laugh threw out this match it would've seemed even stupider and less entertaining then it was. This is wrestling at its worst people. (0.5/10)
--- Handicap Table Dumpster  Match - Road Dogg, X-Pac and Tori Vs The Dudley Boyz  ---
This match was pretty boring and slow paced but was saved from being completely awful by a few tables. The match contained three tables, there was some good after match stuff that included an extra table. The dumpster used in this match had cool side doors however it was used very poorly. (4/10)
--- King of the Ring Tournament Finals Match - Kurt Angle Vs Rikishi ---
The final bout of this mediocre tournament was also bad. It was just about as short as the other tournament matches. The ending was pretty good and clean but the finish didn't save this match from just being overall bad. (2.5/10)
--- Six-Man Tag Team Match for the WWF Championship - Triple H, Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon Vs The Rock, Undertaker and Kane ---
This match starts off just all right but then goes downhill from there until it suddenly picks up during the last minute with a crazy bump by Shane as he got chokeslammed off the top rope threw the announce table. This was a bad main event with a stupid stipulation. The match gives no credibility to the WWF title.  (3/10)
( Extra Features )
The special features on this DVD are horrible, most of the extras can be found on the ppv itself, the only thing that cannot be found on the ppv is the 5 minute exclusive wrap up show which basically goes threw the event and talks about what you just saw. The wrap up contains 5 backstage interviews with Edge and Christian, Kurt Angle, Crash, Gerald Briso and The Rock. The wrestlers are unfortunately still in character when doing these interviews.  I don't know if anyone cares but the exclusive wrap up also quickly shows a third angle to the Shane McMahon bump. Very bad extra features. (1.5/10)
( Overall DVD )
Now you can do whatever you choose with your own money, however let me make a strong recommendation that you do not purchase this event unless you've got nothing else to buy or where at this event. Most of the matches where mediocre and as I stated before not one of the 11 matches are anything but a bit over average. The extra features do not help this DVD from being anything but bad. I recommend you spend your money on something else.",989366400,,5272,4.481789802289282

The highlight of the match was Rock  winning the belt or Shane recieving a 16 ft choke slam into a table.",962064000,,810,4.317880794701987

The Dx/Dudleys was good and so was the 4 corners tag match but the singles matches is where everything falls apart.  Alot of the KOTR matches were real short and for some reason alot of the real good talent was eliminated first.  Benoit and Guerrero both eliminated in their first match.  Why??  The other matches?  Mideo and Mosh, Crash and Buchanan, Patterson and Brisco?  Did anyone care about any of these?  The main event and the tag matches are good the rest skip.",1441065600,,580,4.345794392523365

This match is a short one as Benoit gets DQ'd after attacking Rikishi's left shoulder with a steel chair. Benoit locks in the Crossface on Rikishi and it takes a hoard of referees to get the Rabid Wolverine off Rikishi.

2.) King of the Ring Quarter-Final: Eddie Guerrero w/Chyna vs Val Venis w/Trish Stratus

Nothing short of a tremendous wrestling match. Eddie and Val's styles mixed well in the ring and it showed greatly in this back and forth 8 minute match. Val advances to the semi-finals with a Fisherman Suplex pin on Eddie

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) King of the Ring Quarter-Final: Crash Holly vs Bull Buchanan

Short and sweet match. No one liked Bull Buchanan because he lacked everything to make you get invested in him. Crash gets the surprise victory over Bull with a roll-up in under 5 minutes to advance to the semi-finals

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) King of the Ring Quarter-Final: Chris Jericho vs Kurt Angle

Decent wrestling match from Jericho and Angle here. This wasn't as good as the other matches these 2 cooked up in 2000 but it was decent nonetheless. Stephanie McMahon interferes at the end and gets kissed by Jericho. This distraction allows Angle to get Jericho with the Olympic Slam in the end to win

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Tag Team Championship 14 4 Corners Elimination Match: Edge and Christian vs Too Cool (c) vs The Hardy Boyz w/Lita vs T&A w/Trish Stratus

The Tag Team division was red hot in 2000 and this match was all the proof you needed to know that. Every major Tag Team in the company at that time, throwing down in the ring. This match was just great to put it shortly. T&A gets eliminated first after a Swanton Bomb from Jeff on Test. The Hardyz are next after Christian does the Impaler on Matt and Boston is not happy about that. Edge and Christian end up winning the titles in the end after their dirty tactics, hitting Grandmaster Sexay with one of the titles. REALLY great Tag Team bout

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Rikishi vs Val Venis w/Trish Stratus

This was now Trish's 3rd time out that night, which was a treat in and of itself for all the male fans watching. A basic wrestling bout that sees Rikishi advance with a belly to belly suplex on Venis. Venis assaults Rikishi with the steel steps at the end
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Crash Holly vs Kurt Angle

For a 5 minute bout, this match really impressed. Angle ends up getting the win on Crash, nearing the 5 minute mark with an Olympic Slam to get the win and meet Rikishi in the finals of the King of the Ring tournament

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWF Hardcore Championship Evening Gown Match: Pat Patterson vs Gerald Briscoe (c)

I call this the worst match in Attitude Era history. Patterson looked similar to the killer from the Dressed To Kill movie but a poor version of it and with blonde hair. I'm sure McMahon and Creative found this funny on paper back when this happened; but the fact is, there's nothing funny about this. It was just painful to watch. Whoever the sick person was that thought it was a good idea to have 2 wrinkly old men fight in women's undergarments was hopefully fired not too long after this. Crash Holly saves the day when he interferes, attacks Patterson and Briscoe, and pins Patterson to win the Hardcore Championship.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) Handicap Tables Dumpster Match: D-Generation X (Road Dogg and X-Pac) and Tori vs The Dudley Boyz

This was an entertaining and interesting match to see as this was the only match in WWF history to contain both tables and dumpsters. The Dudleyz get some great offense in on DX early on. Awesome spot near the end where Bubba powerbombs Road Dogg to the outside through 2 tables. DX nail The Dudleyz with steel chairs and toss them in the dumpster for the win. Following the match, both X-Pac and Road Dogg get 3D'd for their troubles and Bubba, Bubba Bombs Tori through a table with her name on it! Great match with a great ending

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

10.) King of the Ring Finals: Kurt Angle vs Rikishi

Another short KOTR match that goes a little over 5 minutes. Angle gets the win with a belly to belly suplex off the top turnbuckle on Rikishi to become the 2000 King of the Ring winner.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

11.) WWF Championship 6 Man Tag Team Match: Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon, and Triple H (c) w/Stephanie McMahon vs Kane, The Undertaker, and The Rock

Yet another interesting match as Triple H had to defend his championship in the first and only 6 man Tag Team match. The stipulation was that whoever got the pinfall on whichever team, would win the WWF Championship. As we reach the climax, the face team implodes as Kane turns on The Rock and The Undertaker turns on Kane, stemming from their own greed on wanting the WWF Championship. The best spot of the match was when Undertaker Chokeslammed Shane McMahon off the turnbuckle and onto the announcer's table. The Rock wins the WWF title with a Rock Bottom on Vince

Overall: Not a bad King of the Ring PPV. There were way too many KOTR matches on the card, which practically made it overwhelming at points and hard to keep up with but it didn't take away from the event",1404086400,,6078,5.538378378378378

If Triple H's team won, he retained the Title. But if either Rock, Kane, or Taker got the pinfall. They would be the WWF Champion. You had a Four Way Elimination Tag Match for the Tag Team titles.

KING OF THE RING 2000

The thing I miss most about wrestling now days is the King of the Ring PPV, honestly it may have been my favorite of all the events. It has always been a tossup between this and the Royal Rumble because I love tournaments and battle royals. So I felt the need to go back and watch one of these events. I decided on this one mainly because I haven't seen it in a while.

1.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]RIKISHI VS CHRIS BENOIT-really good and quick opening match do to the actions of ""the crip... er...murderer"". Rikishi had taken the I-C title from Benoit so he was looking for revenge. He finds it minutes into the match as he attacks Rikishi with a chair earning a DQ. That of course advances Rikishi into the next round.

2.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]EDDIE GUERRERO VS VAL VENIS-excellent match right here that was very competitive. Both men looked great here and the outside interference from Chyna and Trish added to the fun. Great back and forth that sees Val getting the win.

3.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]BULL BUCHANAN VS CRASH HOLLY-this match was the typical bug man vs little guy match. Bull is dominating the entire match but makes that one mistake and gets rolled up real quick for Crash to win.

4.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]CHRIS JERICHO VS KURT ANGLE-we get another good match right here and why not looking at who is participating in this match. Not as fast paced as some of their previous matches but still a good match. These two work very well together and I never knew how much I missed the Steph/Jericho or Steph/Angle stuff until re-watching this match. Angle gets the win here after the stuff with Steph I was talking about.

5.[TAG TITLE ELIMINATION MATCH]TOO COOL VS EDGE & CHRISTIAN VS T&A VS THE HARDY BOYZ-I am a huge tag team wrestling fan so any time I get a match like this I am excited. This is a great elimination match for the tag titles with some good spots for all teams. But it is Edge & Christian that shine the most here starting with their five second pose [man I miss those]. They end up winning the belts after Christian hits Brian with one of the straps but prior to that they were getting beat by Too Cool. I still can't believe that Scotty's worm was so popular, it still cracks me up. Of course some of the best moments happened between T&A and The Hardy's, so everyone was represented well in this match although it was a little too short for some reason to me.

6.[SEMI FINAL MATCH]RIKISHI VS VAL VENIS-this was a short match mush like Rikishi's first one earlier. There was an actual end to this one as Rikishi defeated Val after catching and slamming him. but after the match when Trish was going to demolished by Rikishi Val saves her and attacks Rikishi with the steps, thus setting things up for later.

7.[SEMI FINAL MATCH]KURT ANGLE VS CRASH HOLLY-I remember thinking at the time that there was actually a chance Crash was going to win this. I knew and was from the beginning always rooting for Kurt to win but there was that chance. The match was a good but short one in which Angle came out on top.

8.[HARDCORE TITLE EVENING GOWN MATCH]PAT PATTERSON VS GERALD BRISCO-this match was made only for comedic value. I am not to sure if it was as funny as they wanted but it was still worth a chuckle or two. All I can say is I was very happy that Crash returns to the ring to take the Hardcore title.

9.[HANDICAP TABLE/DUMPSTER MATCH]ROAD DOGG, X PAC, & TORRI VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ-the main thing about this match was Buh Buh wanted very badly to put Torri threw a table. So because of that The Dudley's had to win a table's match while DX had to win a dumpster match. This was a fun match with all five putting forth a great effort, from double team moves to weapons being used we get it all. The match seems like it is going the way of The Dudley's as they make Road Dogg and X-Pac eat wood. But as they are going for Torri they are attacked from the back by Dogg and Pac and put into the dumpster. Thus DX wins the match and start making their way to the back, only they forget about Torri. This sets up a couple of 3-D's and Torri taking some Dudley wood.

10.[FINALS]KURT ANGLE VS RIKISHI-in the finals we would have the Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle against the injured Rikishi. Now this was another good match with Rikishi trying to fight through the pain that was inflicted against him by Benoit and Val Venis. Kurt was too much for him in the end as he became the King of the Ring. I remember being so happy that he won this, since his debut he had always been a favorite of mine. IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE.

11.[WWF TITLE SIX MAN TAG MATCH]-TRIPLE H, VINCE MCMAHON, & SHANE MCMAHON VS THE ROCK, THE UNDERTAKER, & KANE-good main event over all here as the McMahon family unit could lose the title for Triple H if any of them were pinned by any one from the other team. This of course would come into play as Taker, Kane, and Rock would not let each other get the pin at any time. The action gets slow at times but overall it was a good match. The last third of the match is by far the best and that choke slam Shane takes is crazy. But it would be the Rock getting the win and title after pinning Vinnie Mac after a Rock Bottom.

This was a good event in my opinion and much better than people give it credit for. Plus I am a huge Kurt Angle fan so it is a plus that he won. I remember watching this on PPV and rooting for him the whole entire night. So because of his victory I would have to say this was a pretty good event. Also I didn't hate any of the matches; thankfully that hardcore match was short.",1368748800,,5566,4.304680038204394

7895046,5,6305710449,"People keep writing reviews about this WWF PPV as if it is worse than a Bollywood B-Movie. I actually read a lot of reviews before buying things online, this DVD being no exception. As I try to find something good in everything, I did just that with this WWF PPV event. Please forgive me if I review any part of this event out of order; I'm just writing what comes to mind. Though a lot of the early matches were a bit short, the one match that was probably one of the worst and most pointless matches in WWF/WWE history is the evening gown match between Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. That match was so stupid and disgusting that I was split between laughing like hell and throwing up (more so the latter of the two). I almost skipped it, but thought I might miss something important so I stuck with it to the end, which is kind of good because the outcome is funny and relieving.

It seemed as if Crash got an unusual amount of action here and there throughout King Of The Ring, contrasting with the fact that his career didn't receive much push from the WWF back in 2000. I'm also not sure what the WWF what doing with Val Venis in story lines leading up to King Of The Ring, when I saw him, he seemed more like a heel/face hybrid based on his change from being a ladies man to a somewhat darker character with a different entrance and new entrance music + Trish Stratus as his manager. And let's not forget about Kurt Angle: he was the cocky smart ass American hero of the WWF at the time, always bragging about how he is the only true athlete in WWF history and he also never missed an opportunity that was in his favor during KOTR (a foreshadowing to the KOTR Tournament's conclusion).

One of the plus sides to this PPV is that the cut scenes with the McMahons are pretty funny. Another plus is that the transfer of the footage to DVD is very high quality, even when compared to some of the later 2001 and 2002 WWF/WWE DVDs. Something that DID annoy me is how short this event is; most WWF PPV events are 3 to 3.5 hours long, but this one is only about 2.5 hours (excluding extras). Even so, I haven't seen all of the WWF PPVs from 2000, until I have, one thing I can say is that I've seen much worse WWF events from other years.

For those reading, I assume you are also a fan of WWF/WWE professional wrestling, well I'd suggest buying this DVD just so you can own an uncensored piece of the ""Attitude Era"". The price was decent too, at least for me, but costs will rise as copies become more scarce over time (to those reading this review ten or more years from now when the cost has risen over $100). And whether you like it or hate it or something in between, that's up to you. My ultimate verdict is: WWF King Of The Ring 2000 = pretty damn good. Thanks for reading!",1315440000,,2780,4.231638418079096
