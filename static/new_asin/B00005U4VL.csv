7954356,3,B00005U4VL,"CONTENTS of SERIAL KILLERS 4 Movie Pack:

DR. ICE-- Directed and written by the film's star, James A. Brooks. Two homicide detectives must put aside their personal differences while trying to solve a string of murders in Las Vegas.

HUMAN PREY-- A crazed physician kills bad guys in vigilante fashion, and then organizes ""girlhunts.""

JACK THE RIPPER-- Featured in the cast is Charlie Chaplin's daughter Josephine (her grandfather was Eugene O'Neill) and Klaus Kinski (as the Ripper). Best film of this set is an historically inaccurate and quite graphic depiction of the famous 19th Century British prostitute killings.

1-900-- Loaded with lesbianism, male nudity and the like. The female murderer stalks her victims via an adult chat line.

7954357,4,B00005U4VL,"First I have to say I love these Brentwood 4 paks and I have several of them.  But this particular one is pretty bad.  Lets start with the last movie in the 4 pak, Human Prey-Horrible, no need to even watch it, 0 stars but still better than Cold Creek Manor next is Jack the Ripper with Klaus Kinsky 3 stars a good film but nothing to brag about, then there is Dr. Ice staring a Poor Man's Tiger Woods, not only is it bad but the movie cuts off before the end so you don't know how it ends.  And finally there is 1-900 not to be confused with the Dutch film 1-900 that came out in 1984.  Anyway dispite the cheap camcorder look and horrible acting by the main male character, this film was pretty good.  The soundtrack is excellent for such a low buget film, and the story idea was very good.  The acting was pretty good by everyone except the main male Character, the one who didn't like 900 numbers.  I really see what they were trying to do in making this film.  Anyway had the filmakers had more money this would have been a decent film.

I can't believe I am saying this but I would actually recommend buying this film for 1-900, and watch it a few times.  If worse comes to worse you can get a group of friends come over for a Worst films of all time party.  See who can bring the worst movies, you will win with Dr. Ice, but if someone happens to have something worse than Dr Ice, just drop the secret weapon on the pak Human Prey, and you will win hands down.",1135555200,2,1467,4.094405594405594
7954358,1,B00005U4VL,Dr. Ice cuts off close to the end of the movie. No credits or anything. Human Prey was awful. Jack the Ripper is the only justification for owning this set. I didn't even bother with 1-900.,1115942400,3,189,4.277777777777778
7954359,2,B00005U4VL,"I don't know why I bought this, I guess it was because I had just gotten my DVD player, so I wanted to build my collection, and this was four movies for 10 bucks, so I said,'Ok, I'll buy it.
THEY SUCKED!
The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because of two things:
1)Jack The Ripper is good.
2)Lots of frontal nudity.
Otherwise, don't buy.",1058832000,17,355,4.085714285714285
