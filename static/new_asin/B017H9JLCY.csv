7505025,4,B017H9JLCY,"This flick was met with a lot of vitriol from the mainstream critics but in reality it's a pretty clever film parody.  Specific films that I spotted being sent up were ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Castaway"", and ""Silence of the Lambs"".  They even reference the notorious popcorn box scene from ""Diner""!  There's a touching scene where Joe Dirt meets a group of teens who would later become Lynyrd Skynyrd that was genuinely inspired.  David Spade makes for an affable Joe dopy in a smart Homer Simpson-Austin Powers way.  If I were to critique the film it would be that it's a touch too long.  Scenes lose their comic brio before they are over because the proverbial dead horse is being beaten.  This version is advertised as the extended edition so I wonder if the film that was initially shown on Crackle was effectively shorter.  If you were a fan of the first film you won't be disappointed while others may be aghast.",1452384000,,977,4.6395348837209305

7505027,1,B017H9JLCY,"Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser is a sequel to 2001s Joe Dirt, about a down-on-his-luck, mullet-sporting redneck janitor. In the sequel, Joe (David Spade) has won the heart of Brandy (Brittany Daniel) years ago and become the father of triplets, overwhelmed by the responsibility and worried that his immature, dopey ways will influence his kids. With little time to contemplate his future, Joe is swept up in a tornado that deposits him back in 1965 to a kind of alternative universe.

 The filmmakers struggle to make this loopy premise and sub-par writing work. The actors try their best to make unfunny jokes sparkle but, unable to overcome the lackluster material, they reminded me of seals desperately flapping their flippers to collect a sardine. Spade is a funny guy, as his work on Saturday Night Live attests, but he has hit bottom with this dreary flick. He shares writing credit with Fred Wolf.

The Blu-ray edition contains a never-before-seen extended cut. A digital HD copy is included.",1452038400,2,997,4.993975903614458

7505031,3,B017H9JLCY,"""It's not 2015, it's 1965."" Joe Dirt (Spade) has the perfect life. Beautiful wife, great kids and is happy, but still doesn't think he's good enough. After a tornado rips through his town Joe finds himself in the past. Trying to figure out how to get back home Joe realizes that this is his chance to change who he is and become the person he thinks his wife Brandy (Daniel) really wants. The more he tries to change the worse things get. This is a sequel that I'm not sure many people were asking for. That said it wasn't that bad. There was some funny stuff in this and was about the same type of humor, maybe a little more sappy, than the original. I do really like David Spade though. The movie was a mix of Forrest Gump, Wizard of Oz and It's A Wonderful Life all mixed with a redneck spin, and to me that actually helped it and was very fun to watch. This is nothing that will become a classic, and it would have bombed bad in theaters, but as far as a rental and watch at home movie you could do worse. I liked it and was entertained enough by it. Overall, if you liked the first one you will like this one too. I give it a B.",1449187200,6,1133,4.0625
7505032,3,B017H9JLCY,"I wouldn't necessarily spend money on this. I watched it on Crackle for free and found it very weird because it does take a very very strange twist really early on in the movie. However, I did stick with it and because it was on I stayed tuned in. I wouldn't go out of your way for this flick but if you find yourself feeling nostalgic and for some reason the original isn't plausible to find, go ahead and watch this. Suspend reality though, otherwise you're  going to have a bad time. The original was a flatout comedy, this is more of a comedy with sci fi elements (yes, you read that correctly) This movie involves time traveling via a tornado ride. Also, Joe loses some of his ""loser love"" sympathy from an audience's perspective because he becomes a little more competent as the movie goes on so  that same stupidity charm that made you love him in the original somewhat will go away during this movie. Alas, if this movie is on or free in your vicinity, feel free to check it out. DO NOT PAY TO WATCH THIS.",1448323200,9,1013,4.326315789473684
7505033,2,B017H9JLCY,The original was a cult Classic that can be enjoyed over and over. This one never makes it out of the gate.,1448064000,3,107,3.909090909090909
7505034,4,B017H9JLCY,"The sequel opens with Dennis Miller doing his typical comical similes, demonstrating he is more knowledgeable about bad hillbilly teeth than Monday Night Football. The film starts out with a good comical, if not slightly crude, birth scene. The film had better scenes, and is more enjoyable if one does not attempt to think about continuity. The movie is a Joe Dirt ""It's a Wonderful Life"" sort of but not exactly. The movie also spoofs other film scenes including the ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Back to the Future:, and ""Forrest Gump.""

There were some comical moments, some scenes that didn't work, and a touch of genius, and a bit of crudeness. It is an enjoyable heart warming film for Hollywood versions of rednecks. End credits includes bloopers.

7505049,1,B017H9JLCY,"REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:

I loved the original ""Joe Dirt"" and highly recommend it, but ""Joe Dirt 2"" was nowhere near as good.  I laughed a few times, but the pacing was too slow, the humor too crass, and some of the situations too absurd even for Joe Dirt, nevermind that it turned out to all have been a dream.  It ended up being a redneck time-travel cross between ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and vaguely ""The Wizard of Oz.""

""It was all just a dream"" movies generally are just an annoying waste of time.  For some reason I feel compelled to forgive ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Wizard of Oz,"" maybe because ""The Wizard of Oz"" is so fantastical that it's obviously ""not reality"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" from the beginning explicitly states, ""This is the *alternate* reality in which the character was never born,"" but then dream movies like ""Joe Dirt 2"" masquerade as a plot until the main character wakes up at the end and has a slightly character-changing epiphany like, ""I *might* get more out of life if I eat less and exercise more.""  Even with the slightly character-changing epiphany, it feels like any accomplished character development was completely undone and the last hour-and-a-half to two hours was a complete waste of time.  (At least this movie didn't end with the family dog humping a stuffed animal like another movie which was ruined by being ""just a dream.""  Oh, wait, we were made to see FOUR computer-animated dogs humping David Spade's arms and legs while he was sprawled out on the ground in the middle the movie.)

The style of narration annoyingly kept changing between Dennis Miller talking about Joe Dirt and Joe Dirt telling his life story like Forrest Gump.

I picked this up at Walmart for 4 bucks and I feel like I paid too much.  Like somebody else said, you might want to watch it once if you're a Joe Dirt fan and can see it for free, but prepare to be disappointed.",1480377600,,1911,4.574780058651027

We liked all the twists and turns the plot took, and like how it went back in time. It's hard to top the original, but this movie was like revisiting an old friend.

Watched it over 100 of times.  Joe Dirt part 2 is not so great but does have a couple super funny parts in it that makes me laugh harder than any part in joe dirt 1.  That being said,  Joe Dirt 2 will be a one time only dvd to watch and then it will be used as a table leveler.  It is basically a sci fi style movie.  Jumps back in time and the time line jumps around.  There is also the issue with him seeing his inner demons and angel in the form of a biker gang.  When you watch the movie you will see.  Anyway,  I will not be purchasing the dvd myself.  It is worth watching just to say you watched it.  You will laugh hard at least twice.  When the movie is finished you will overall be disappointed.
