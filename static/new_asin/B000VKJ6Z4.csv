2942669,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Okay, the whole concept is weird at first, even by anime standards. There's a duck, who can turn into a girl with the help of a pendant. The pendant can also turn her into magical girl ballerina Princess Tutu. She's trying to bring the missing pieces of the prince's heart back to him. Fakir is the prince's bodyguard, trying to protect him at all costs. Kraehe is the prince's girlfriend, who can also turn into Tutu's arch-nemesis, Princess Kraehe.
Last but not least, the storyteller is manipulating all of them in every way he can, to make the most tragic story of all time. He has magical jewels, curses and the power to stop time. The storyteller died before he could finish his last story, so to make up for it, he's returning back from the dead to toy with real people as actors for the story.
Yes, the story is really bizarre. It reminds me of a twisted, fairy-tale version of ""The Truman Show."" While a production like this could easily fall apart, the animators pull off a splendid job with the characters. Ahiru looks amazingly cute and pretty as the heroine duck/ballerina and all the other characters have distinguished designs as well.
I had a blast watching the story unfold. I never thought that shoujo characters could show this much emotion. I especially loved the evil storyteller, who hides in the background as the ""intelligent designer""--literally.
I never thought I would love a pseudo-magical girl anime this much. I guess this is the best ballet anime ever made...now that's a first.",1200096000,7,1509,4.741444866920152
2942670,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"This is one of my favorite animes of all time. The box is very deceiving, as is the title. The box makes it look kind of trashy and I don't know why they did that b/c it doesn't match the anime at all. Its a WONDERFUL story!",1199577600,,224,3.7872340425531914
2942671,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"First off, before I review this, I have to say, Princess Tutu is my FAVORITE anime. Ever. And I've seen a lot. It's fantastic, and I think everyone should see it.

I'm not sure how to summarize the story. It's very complex and engaging. I have to mention first, this anime is very much like a fairy tale. (in fact it uses a lot of Germanic legend and folklore as inspiration) It focuses on a girl, who is really a duck, named Duck, who is in love with a Prince without a heart. She is given a pendant by a man named Drosselmeyer, who is the man pulling the strings behind the whole story. The pendant allows her to take the form of a human girl. This pendant also allows her to turn into Princess Tutu. While Duck is Princess Tutu, she can search for and retrieve shards of the Prince's heart. Throughout the series, Duck must face different obstacles, such a Knight whose role in the story is ambiguous at first, (is he friend or foe?) another Princess who claims the Prince is hers, and various people under the influence of the heart shards of the Prince. I won't say more than that, because I'm afraid I'll spoil this amazing story.

Keep in mind, Princess Tutu does have quite a bit of dancing, many episodes draw inspiration from famous ballets, and music from those ballets is used throughout the series. However, the dancing is beautiful, and even if you aren't familiar with ballet, the extras are there to help you.

This is the first boxset that ADV has done right. (at least from the dvds I've bought from them) They haven't stripped the extras, and there are a lot of them. Some of the extras include ""Ballet for Beginners,"" (which explains the different ballet that are mentioned/used in the series) commentary from the voice actors and staff, outtakes, and tv promos, among other things.

I really can't say enough good things about this anime. At first glance, it may seem childish, but if you stick with it, there are a lot of mature themes going on throughout the anime. It has so many levels to it...it's simply amazing, that's all I can say. I'd recommend this for 13+ for some violence blood, and chaste nudity. (as in all you really see is the silhouette)",1199404800,48,2177,4.50379746835443
2942672,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"This is a great series and yes it does have a goofy kid like name to it. But don't let that fool you. This series is a total HIDDEN GEM. I love anime but i don't track how well a series does in DVD sales. I believe the individual DVDs are discontinued. But get this box set which contains seasons 1 & 2 and for the current sale price its almost 1.00 per episode. The story is about a girl name Duck who is actually a DUCK but turns into a girl when a story teller grants her a wish. She utilizes her time as a girl drooling over the cutest guy at school but the boy has a SECRET. Along with being able to be a girl she can transform into Princess Tutu where she must help save the prince & get back the shards to his scattered heart. This series has it all and the best thing is, it has MYSTERY which kept my attention. Alot of these new anime titles lately really don't have an ENGAGING element to keep me attracted. Princess TuTu kept me glued to the screen the WHOLE TIME. Its also directed by the creator of Sailor Moon so it has that magic touch already. Surprisingly alot of new anime titles created past the year 2000 have a certain drawing style to it and it doesnt seem to have the colorful VIBRANT images of series that was animated in the 1990's. Overall i am so pleased with my purchase and i love the PRICE i got it at. ENJOY!!!!!!",1199059200,21,1344,4.0754716981132075
2942673,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"When I was reccomended this anime I was not that excited and was expecting the normal shallow story. But I was way wrong. The characters in this story, the beauty of ballet, and the story itself will rock you to your core. Don't let the title or the idea of ballet put you off. This is a work of genius and I have no complaints. I own one anime and a few mMiyazaki's however I have watched a lot. Still this anime is good enough for me to have watched it 3 times and still want to buy this.",1197244800,3,490,3.95959595959596
2942674,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Although this anime might seem like a silly, cute cartoon about a magical ballerina, it is so much more. The plot is engaging and the characters interesting and well developed. While it might start out like a typical magical girl anime, it develops into quite a fairy tale adventure. The music is also wonderful, having been taken from various ballets. Highly recommend! I wish the set came with a bit more than just the discs, but it's well worth it for the price, especially since the single discs are becoming hard to find.",1195084800,21,526,4.666666666666667
2942675,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"If you can get past the title of the series, you will find that this will soon become a favorite story. The elements of this story combine traditional European storytelling, animated dance, and unexpected relationships that break the trend of traditional Princess stories.

The series splits into 2 parts: Chapter of Egg and Chapter of Fledgling (which is arguably when the story really ""takes flight""). While the ending of each season may only suit a particular audience, those who detect the strong symbolism underneath each individual episode will be quite satisfied with the finale.

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves symbolism, a surprise ending, and sadistic storytellers; of which is our beloved Drosselmeyer's tale of Princess Tutu!",1194480000,17,750,5.294117647058823

2942711,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"While I've grown up with and always considered myself a fan of anime, there still remains a great many series I've yet to watch. So I've been slowly chipping away at a rather long ""to watch"" list.  Being a fan of the ""magical girl"" genre (with shows such as Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew), I decided to take a look at this short, but noteworthy show; wondering why more than a few people were hailing it as one of the best animes they ever watched.

While I wouldn't go so far as to call it the best anime I've ever seen, it's certainly a step above your typical superhero/fantasy show, with a semi-complicated plot, and three dimensional characters that explore what it truly means to love someone and have free will.

Once there was a writer named Drosselmeyer, who had the power to make his stories come to life. But he died before he could finish his final tale, ""The Prince and The Raven"", leaving the two titular characters locked in an eternal battle. After many years, the Raven managed to break free into the real world, and the Prince pursued him. To seal away the Raven's evil, Prince Mytho shattered his own heart with his sword, causing him to lose all his memories and emotions. Drosselmeyer, now a ghost, decides the story must have an ending. He finds it in the form of a little duck, who has fallen in love with Mytho. He gives her a magic pendant that can transform her into a human girl, and then into the graceful ballerina, Princess Tutu. It then falls on Duck to find all the scattered shards of Mytho's heart and return them to him. But her mission is beset by more than a few challenges; the foremost being that if Mytho regains his heart, it also means unleashing the evil Raven. Add to it a cynical knight, the Raven's scheming daughter, and the fact that if Tutu professes her love for the Prince, she'll turn into a speck of light--and Duck realizes she'll have to gather all her courage to ensure the story has a happy ending.

Anyone who's a fan of a good old fashioned fairy tale will greatly enjoy this series, as the entire story is mainly told through ballet, with a wide range of classical musical scores from various plays, ballets, and dances peppered in each episode and helping tell the tale. Admittedly, the first few episodes can be kind of confusing to sit through, when the audience is treated to a world where humans and anthropomorphic animals live side by side without batting an eyelash. But gradually, the town's weirdness DOES get explained, though I won't spoil it.

But what really makes this series great is its characters. Duck is a sweet and caring girl, who battles darkness through the art of dance, and talking down her enemies, rather than just delivering a smackdown--something you don't often see in most television. Mytho starts off as an emotionless robot, but as more of his heart is put back together, the more heroic he becomes. And Fakir the knight, and Rue, the Raven's daughter, who both start off as practically villains, turn out to not be so bad or heartless as once believed. If anything, it's Drosselmeyer who's the true menacing presence, as he takes great joy in manipulating the characters and toying with their lives, causing all the key players to have to unite to carve out their own ending, rather than just follow the fates they were given.

A magical girl ballet with a Brothers Grimm edge, this is one anime that deserved to go on a bit longer. With deep themes about true love and defying fate, and an unexpected ending, this is one series that can stand up there with the best fairy tales.",1458777600,,3574,4.559190031152648
2942712,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I would give it 10 if I could.  I love all the features, bonus episodes, clips of seeing the voice actors, the commentary, and everything.  This anime was well written to the end.  The soundtrack was beautiful.  I wish there were more episodes or some sort of spinoff.",1457827200,,268,4.520833333333333
2942713,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"The five star rating on this review is for the show itself. It's an excellent dark twist on the Magical Girl genre, playing out like a Grimm Bros. fairy tale, and an excellent one at that. However, it's still unclear if Aesir Holdings will update the packaging for the DVDs. This will be the fourth complete collection for this show. The first box set produced in 2007, by the now defunct ADV, is so far the only one that's packaged well, using plastic pages to hold the discs inside of a large DVD case. The other two sets released since have been stack-packs; a case with a deep spindle where all the DVDs sit on top of each other. These are notoriously bad for holding discs, and they WILL get scratched, no matter how careful you are with them. If the producers for the show change the packaging to the page method, then picking this up will be a no-brainer; but if not, then it may still be worth it to track down the 2007 set. I will say however, that the box and disc art for this new set are big improvements over the previous releases. Also, it looks like every bonus material item will be included like in the past releases, which is a big plus. The show itself is perfection, but only time will tell if it's worth it to get this set if you already own it.

Update (3/15/16): I received my copy of this early, and I'm happy to annouce that the case uses a page setup similar to the 2007 set, albeit about 3x thinner (more shelf space). With that being said, I highly recommend this new collection if you own either the 2009 or 2011 stackpack release, as chances are, your discs are probably a bit worse for wear at this point (if you haven't swapped the case out). With the vast amount of content you get in this release, the price is extremely low. I highly recommend this new release of Princess Tutu, and I recommend it to fans of the show, fans of magical girl anime, and those who simply enjoy a good story.",1456704000,18,1922,4.294765840220386

2942726,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"There is simply nothing else like Princess Tutu in anime. The simplicity of a fairy tale and the satisfaction of a tight two cour anime. The balance of drama with comedy. The pacing, expertly juggled between downtime that establishes the situation, and revelatory twists in plot and character development!

And truly, has there ever been a villain more charming and memorable than Drosselmeyer? But seriously, the metafictional narrative and blurring of fiction and reality was just a treat for anyone who is interested in writing, reading, and the conventions of stories.

And I gotta say, Fakir went from being an annoying stereotype to having one of the most satisfying character arcs I've ever had the pleasure to witness. The other character arcs weren't quite as original, but that's no obstacle for being satisfying and well-executed, with their own lovely little details that make them memorable.

It's a masterpiece in storytelling and entertainment, a genuine work of art that almost seems impossible with how stale and vulgar the current anime scene is.",1439337600,,1064,5.2105263157894735

Once upon a time, there was a duck...once upon a time, there was a girl...one upon a time, there was a princess...I'm not saying more about the story itself as many reviewers have done a much better job than I would at describe it.

At first glance, this series can look like your usual 'shoujo' (girl manga/anime) magic girl story but it goes beyond that, mixing fairy tales, story telling, ballet and music. It is filled with beauty, grace and poetry. Moments are very emotional, others are pretty silly.
This is NOT a Walt Disney story!! The characters aren't black and white, but more complex and the ending is unexpected which made me love this series all together.

A very delightful experience. I would totally recommend it.

2942760,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I would like to start off by saying that no matter how you buy this series (be it the DVD singles, or any of the three available Complete Collections), you will receive a fantastic anime series with ALL of the bonus content. Don't let the title fool you, as this show isn't just a simple magical girl series; it's a tragic fairy tale set to classical music and ballet. The music in this series is a huge selling point, and it makes every scene more powerful, more touching, and even more heartbreaking. Princess Tutu is easily an anime classic, and deserves more recognition than it gets. (Please be aware however: due to setting up the story, the first 2-3 episodes are a lot more like a typical magical girl series; it needs time to gather all the pieces together.) I could go on, but there are much better written reviews here already to tell you everything you need to know. This review will focus on the different packaging of the series, and how it will affect you.

This series, like many others, was first released in DVD volumes. These 6 DVDs all come with reversible cover art, one side with a light theme, and one side with a dark theme. In 2007, ADV released the first complete set for Region 1. Unlike their previous collections, this set retained all of the extra features the singles had (there are *tons* of extras for this series, which the other sets also retain). This is the set I specifically sought out for myself, and I'll tell you why. Even though the box art is extremely misleading, with Rue in a revealing outfit on the cover; and even though the brown (with pink and blue accents) color design is horrible for this show, this Complete Collection is packaged well. Let me explain: both the 2009 and 2011 collections for this show are stackpacks (a case with a deep spindle where all 6 discs are stacked on top of each other). Stackpacks are notorious for damaging discs. No matter how gently you treat them, the discs will rub against each other and scratch. The 2007 set's discs are connected to plastic pages inside the case, with individual holding slots.

If you can manage to find a copy of the 2007 set somewhere (I'm pretty sure Amazon currently has no more), or all 6 DVD volumes, these are the best ways to buy this wonderful series and keep it pristine and watchable forever. Another option is to buy the newest set and replace the case, however these replacement cases can often be flimsy and unreliable.

BTW, I recommend the dub. Luci Christian plays an endearing Duck (or Ahiru, if you prefer), and flawlessly converts her lovable voice into Tutu's, which is soft and sweet. Every other character, from the mysterious narrator, the wonderful Mr. Cat, and the devious Drosselmeyer is voiced perfectly in the dub version of this show, leading to total immersion as you lose yourself in the magic of Princess Tutu.

Not convinced? As of right now, you can watch the (dubbed) show for FREE on Hulu! Give it a go and decide for yourself!

Edit: (12-3-14) I provided some customer images with my review, but they don't seem to be working properly. They were fine a few days ago, but are now unavailable. Huh. :/

Edit: (1-10-16) The show is going to be released again this year. Whether or not it will be a stackpack remains to be said, but if it's not, I highly recommend ordering it when it becomes available!

Edit: (1-22-16) Just noticed that Princess Tutu has been removed from Hulu for free streaming. :,(",1417392000,5,3446,4.59349593495935

The story? All the other reviews I'd encountered talked it up as deep many-nuanced storyline. The adults here found the main character Duck obnoxious with voice acting on the shrill/grating side (and expect to hear this entirely too much). None of us was very interested in the opening storyline involving 7-9 year old girls living in dorms and attending a ballet academy.

The kids on the hand were enthralled.  ""She turns into a duck!""  and  ""Can we watch Princess Tutu more?"" Enough said.  Some of the girls even started to imitate the dances, which as a supervising adult (to me) meant this series has like 1000% more usefulness and inspirational impact than the usual Disney cartoon.

The only qualm I have is with the packaging. When you open up the DVD, all of the discs are piled on top of each other on the same platform.

The show is amazing and I highly recommend it for others to watch all the time! I ordered it right away and waited impatiently for it only to frown heavily at the method of which they gave me my DVDs.

All 6 of them stacked on top of one another in a huge box (with a chunk of foam?! No booklets or episode guides??) that could have very easily had separate spot casings placed within. Thankfully nothing was scratched or broken but honestly, there's no excuse for that. It was cheap and the kinda thing I'd expect to see from a bootleg copy seller.

I'm heavily disappointed and had to purchase separate DVD casings for them to prevent any damage that might come from leaving them like that. I suggest you fix that issue right away before you end up with a LOT of returns thanks to bad packaging.",1391644800,12,934,4.331428571428572

The disks aren't damaged, but they will be soon, with this set up, and it is a pain to get to my favorite episodes, which are at the bottom.

2942813,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"This is one of those rare shows that is able to combine multiple contrasting themes and motifs into a single beautiful storyline; and I wish anime and non-anime fans would watch, because it's that good. The idea of using classical ballet and old-style fairy tales, in a TV show much less an anime, sounds like a recipe for disaster, but in this instance is done masterfully. It may seem odd to use ballet as a means of solving a conflict but by the fourth episode, it feels very organic, as opposed to just a gimmick.

  Also, other than the works of Hayao Miyazaki, this is the only movie/TV show that has the same feel to it as an old fairy tale. As I watch it it is very evocative of the stories of Hans Christian Anderson or George MacDonald. Princess Tutu demonstrates a better understanding, I think, of fairy tales than Walt Disney or for that matter how to utilize classical music in an animated medium; how the show weaves various classical pieces into the storyline is done so well, you do not think anything sticks out oddly even when they play extremely well known pieces of music.

  I would recommend buying the DVD set, since it's cheap firstly, but also it has a wealth of useful special features. As, to what age group this would be acceptable for, 12-13 would be fine in my opinion, although I wouldn't suggest using it for an elementary music class (both my parents are music teachers ergo the scenario of using this to expose children to classical music instantly crosses my mind by reflex) because of a few things which some might object to, or some children may not be mature enough to deal with (although the outtakes and commentary of the special features are a definite TV-14 rating I'd say). The things that will make you want to watch a few episodes before you decide if your kids can watch this show are thus: what another reviewer referred to as 'chaste nudity' which is quite apt (effectively brief partial nudity/ nude silhouette) but there is no hint of sexuality during the entire series, I believe a few instances of mild cursing, mild violence, and some 'dark' subject matter ::MILD SPOILER:: ( a character is motivated by fear of a 'father' figure).
All in all, this is a fantastic series for just about everyone that I can't recommend highly enough, but for children 12 or younger, you will want to make sure you deem it appropriate yourself; although I think this series would make an excellent introduction into the world of classical music and dance (Some of the special features look like they were probably made for that purpose in mind).",1378598400,,2580,4.622270742358078

The story can be watched by kids as just a fairy tale, albeit a darker one in the latter half. Or you can watch as an adult and the latter episodes will take you as deep as you want to go. It really made me sit and think about what I write and what exactly is writing me.

2942835,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I know what you're thinking...Princess Tutu?  My family thinks that I've gone off the deep end when I said I loved this show.  Let me start off by saying that Princess Tutu is a well thought, deeply engaging and dark story in the format of a fairy tale.  Everything about the show is perfect, from the characters to the voice actors, the story to the music (all classical).  Everything clicks, and if you give it a chance it will not disappoint you (as long as you have a high tolerance for the strange).

The story is about a girl named Duck, who is actually a duck, but has been given the opportunity to be a girl and become Princess Tutu in order to help restore the shattered heart of the prince, Mytho.  The thing is, the person who granted her this power is the dead author of a story, the Prince and the Raven, and Mytho is the actual prince escaped from the story.  Along the way, Duck has to deal with the challenges of an overprotective knight (Fakir) and an evil Princess (Rue) who are determined to keep Mytho's heart in pieces.  The end result is a story that is wonderfully endearing and deep on many levels, and begs the question, how much are these characters in control of their own fate within the lines of the Prince and the Raven?

Despite fitting the model of a magic girl anime, Princess Tutu is far from the norm of the genre.  With rich influences of fairy tales like Brothers Grimm, as well as classical influences of ballet and music, this anime-turned-metafiction is just about one of the best shows I've ever seen.

Come on, you know you want to watch this adorable show. Guy or girl, this show is awesome. I cant say anything about the english voices, I always like the Japanese voices myself, but that is just me. The music is sweet, I love the main intro song. I could listen to it a thousand times. The characters are hilarious and it's so crazy that no one realizes their teacher is a CAT! He is my favorite. Sounds crazy huh? BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GREAT! Its random, but really funny and sweet.

The reason any parent should be hesitant or at least aware is because this is authentic Japanese anime....and one has to be careful when dealing with such.  Yes, some of the characters are scantily dressed but my girls even commented on that to me as their only complaint.

2942863,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"Look, I was skeptical about this series too, but someone I respected recommended the series to me so I checked it out on Netflix.

Is it cutesy? Yes. Is the story really simple? Yes, of course, it's for kids. Does it talk down to children? Never. It's goofy sometimes, heartwarming sometimes, and over-all it has a lot of things that are clearly for little children.

That said, while it may be simple it's never simplistic. It's not pandering like most little kids shows are (especially shows intended for girls). The music is wonderful, with some of the best classical ballet pieces in the world presented. The art is amazing, even if the animation is sometimes minimalistic, and the parts where they obviously had budget problems are seamlessly integrated with some very well edited still frame shots which are downright gorgeous.

A few things to keep in mind: This is not a ""Magical Girl"" anime like Sailor Moon. It's a FAIRY TALE, and I mean closer to like what the Brothers Grimm would have written rather than the sappy stuff we tend to show our kids. There is some implied nudity, but you never see any naughty bits. There are some situations that will be, to small children, either confusing or disturbing. If you're not sure, watch it first, but I'd go so far as to say that there isn't anything inappropriate in here... But someone more prudish might disagree with me.

The first few episodes start off slowly, and there's a fair amount of WTF involved in it, but if you stick with it you will be rewarded with something really quite wonderful. Give it a shot. Ignore the name, I know ""Princess Tutu"" sounds silly but it works for what they were going for.",1329264000,3,1668,4.6440677966101696
2942864,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I'll tell you a secret. The reason we nerds buy up so many cartoons on DVD is not just because we love these programs so much. Though that's certainly part of it. The reason we buy so many DVDs is because we want to someday watch them with our children. Because, let's face it, TV nowadays sucks. So, be it ""Batman the Animated Series"" or ""Dragon Ball Z"" our kids are going to grow up right! But, there's one thing nagging us in the back of our minds. One thing we don't want to admit to ourselves, but I'll say it right here right now, ""What if we have daughters?""

I can't watch ""Die Hard"" with a daughter!

There is only one alternative. Those of us who are secure enough in our manhood need to diversify our collections to plan for the unthinkable. We need to buy some cartoons that aren't specifically aimed at boys. And my brief, but impartial, research has pointed me to ""Princess Tutu.""

Princess Tutu is a unique Magical Girl anime. It's about a girl named Duck, who transforms into Princess Tutu to save her would-be boyfriend, Mytho, a boy who has lost all of his feelings. But, it's much deeper than that. The whole story is actually a fairy tale, and the characters are characters from the story come to life.

What makes this series worth owning is the dedication poured into every aspect of the production. The series parallels several different fairy tales, plays, and ballets. Nearly all of the music has been lifted from appropriate ballets. You don't have to be a ballet aficionado to appreciate it, several of the special features are dedicated to explaining these things.

Each disk is packed with special features. While some anime have 1 episode with commentary every 13 episodes, there is one commentary track on each disk. Plus, ""Ballet for Beginners"" with the characters explaining some basic ballet terms. ""Etude"" which explains where the music you hear comes from. ""In the Booth"" with the voice actors. Plus, several specials and notes on the production. Seldom do anime get this type of treatment in the American release, so it's good to see that ADV went all out.

In summation, Princess Tutu is a great series with superb special features. The only downside is that it does come shipped in a spindle pack. All the disks are stacked up on top of each other, instead of being separate or in thin packs. It was my experience that only one disk was knocked loose during shipping, and still played fine. You can remedy your dilemma by simply storing them in different cases after you receive them. If you plan to wait for it to simply be repackaged, there's no way of knowing when that will be, or if they'll carry over the same special features.

Yu Yu Hakusho used to have commentary when it was originally released, but doesn't in the new think pack release.

Don't miss a chance to own one of the best Shojo anime of the last decade. Your future daughters will thank you.

And now to wait for Hasbro to release ""Friendship is Magic.""",1327708800,8,2963,4.586011342155009

Second, they did not include an insert listing what is on each of the 6 disks.  I have to admit that my daughter has the series memorized and that it is not a problem for her.  If you are new to Princess Tutu it could be disappointing and a little daunting to have to plunge in without a guide of some sort.

Overall the quality of the set is good and it has most of what we look for with optional language and subtitles.  Also there are bonus features that are nice to see.

I love anime, but i don't track how well a series does in DVD sales. I believe the individual DVDs are discontinued at this time, but get this box set which contains seasons 1 & 2. Especially for the current sale price its almost 1.00 per episode. The story is about a girl named, Duck, who is actually a DUCK. However, she turns into a girl when a story teller grants her a wish. She utilizes her time as a girl drooling over the cutest guy at school, but only to find out the boy has a HUGE SECRET.

Along with being able to be a girl, she can transform into Princess Tutu where she must help save the prince & get back the shards to his scattered heart. This series has it all and the best thing is, it has MYSTERY which kept my attention. The show takes classic fairty tales that children grew up with and twists the conventional knowledge of what we know and gives it a tractured touch. Alot of these new anime titles lately really don't have an ENGAGING element to keep me attracted. Princess TuTu kept me glued to the screen the WHOLE TIME. I had a marathon and went from episode to episode one night. The show is the classic take on good versus evil. The ending is a SHOCKER. It's also directed by the direcor of Sailor Moon (season one) so it has that magic touch already. Surprisingly, alot of new anime titles created past the year 2000 have a certain drawing style to it. They no longer seems to have that VIBRANT color scheme, like anime series that were created in the 1990's. Overall i am so pleased with my purchase and i love the PRICE that i got it at.

I cannot say enough good things about this anime. People might initially view it as childish or too girly... but there are a lot of dark themes that come up in this series. It is definitely not a child's anime.

As mentioned already, the ballet theme coupled with the fairy tale settings make for a beautiful set for an anime like no other I have ever seen. Sure, it's got similar themes like shoujo or magical-girl... but the way they pull it off is so beautiful and amazing. The characters are endearing... I believe I cared about every central character that appeared in the series (which is rather rare for me). The story is rich with emotions very powerful. There is nothing shallow about this anime at all. There is nothing sickly sweet or corny or embarrassing about this anime. In fact, I would recommend everyone and anyone who likes anime and can at least try expanding their horizons beyond the standard samurai, mecha and ecchi fare to give this series a try.

It is not only worth buying. It's worth keeping around for a lifetime.",1320451200,,1208,4.587962962962963
2942878,3,B000VKJ6Z4,"I'd read about Princess Tutu on a couple of the anime sites, and it was highly recommended wherever I saw it mentioned. I love ballet, so buying the set seemed to be a no-brainer. When I began watching the series, I wasn't so sure. I'm an adult, and it seemed too shojo (for young girls) to me. I thought that Duck's voice was too shrill, and the boys were too pretty.  However, having already spent money on it, I stuck to it, and I was well rewarded. Duck's voice grew on me, especially her expressive quacking. The pretty boys turned out to be more troubled and complex than they initially appeared. And, wonderfully, the representation of ballet was perfect. It's not that everything was animated. This is TV anime, not studio Ghibli art. However, the characters' ballet positions were perfect, and the limited animation somehow did suggest the beauty of ballet.

Princess Tutu is a fairy tale constructed out of several fairy tales and told in the world of ballet and through ballet. As we all know, fairy tales have some very dark themes. The story delves into subjects such as self sacrifice on behalf of others and free will as well as peaceful and non-peaceful methods of conflict resolution. The main character is Duck, a duck who is given a pendant that turns her into a human girl, and under certain circumstances, a sort of super hero ballerina. Most of the characters are humans, but an occasional talking and dancing animal slips in, as does a puppet or two.

The music is a vital component of the anime. The soundtrack is composed of famous (Western) classical music including selections from Tchaikovsky's ballets, the opera Carmen, and Pictures at an Exhibition. The music is great, but if you are familiar with the pieces, the juxtaposition of music by different composers may jar you a little. The music goes together well, but the switch from one composer to another caught me by surprise, here and there.

I thought that the extras were exceptionally interesting. Some of the episodes had commentary by the writers and translators as well as the English voice actors. There were also little animated lessons about ballet.

Regarding the packaging, add me to the list of people who hated the spooled stack of the six disks. This packaging inhibits access and is probably more conducive to scratching the disks than most arrangements. Also, if there was a way to listen to the DVDs dubbed in English and with subtitles, I didn't figure it out. The disk menu did show subtitles with the Japanese language version.

This anime grows on one as it progresses. I would state that it IS more for girls than boys, but there is much in it that a boy could enjoy and relate to. Give it a shot!",1319587200,8,2704,4.694092827004219

The story of Princess Tutu centers on a young teen named Ahiru (which translates into `duck' in Japanese).  This young girl is actually a duck who has been transformed into a girl and it becomes apparent early on in the show that Ahiru has some sort of destiny to fulfill. Ahiru studies classical ballet at a private school and develops a deep crush on a strange young man, Mytho. It turns out that Mytho's heart is in pieces and it is up to Ahiru to restore his feelings. Of course, there are several antagonists that try to prevent Ahiru from achieving her goal. Fortunately, Ahiru is also able to transform into the magical prima ballerina Princess Tutu, and this helps her to gradually fulfill her mission.

There are many layers to this story, and just when you think you've figured everything out, there are interesting twists and developments that keep the story fresh and interesting. Adults will delight in the use of classical music and ballet moves as well as the richly-layered plot. Children like my young daughter will be enchanted by the quirky cast of characters, the cute mannerisms, and of course the vibrant colors that infuse this enchanting anime production. The soundtrack is equally compelling, especially ""Morning Grace"" by Ritsuko Okazaki.",1311552000,2,1531,4.903474903474904

Overall Princess Tutu really surprised me, the story was cute and endearing but more complicated then I had originally expected. The characters are genuine and likable, and are given a chance to change and evolve throughout the series. I will avoid giving away any spoilers, but as this seemingly simple fairytale unfolds there are more layers and surprises around each corner.

This show is something that could be enjoyed by both kids and adults, it is geared more towards girls but it is not so horribly feminine that a more receptive guy couldn't enjoy it. If you are a fan of ballet, or like another look at the show, I really enjoyed re-watching the episodes with commentary. The (English) cast takes turns talking about the actual music and dances behind the shows, which I found really fascinating.

The only real downside that I found to the show is that the first episode is a bit annoying, but after that I fell in love! If you give this anime a try, don't get detured by episode one if you find it a bit annoying, it really is a good show.",1292803200,3,1223,4.529411764705882

I'm so glad that I did.

I burned through watching the entire series in two days. There was a lot that I'd forgotten about the story of Duck, Fakir, Rue and Mytho. I'd forgotten how funny Mr Cat was. How creepy Drosselmeyer could be. How controlling Fakir was over Mytho in the beginning. How complex Rue's story was. How delightful Ahiru/Duck could be in all her awkward earnestness.

I've only gotten up to around episode 14 but I've fallen in love.

My only complaint I have is on the English dub and the 'Beginner Ballet' lessons. The English voice cast take 'weird' to the extreme with their either extremely high, low, squeaky, or tired voices, and it causes distraction. So normally I just turn on the subtitles and switch it to Japanese, which sounds much more pleasing to the ears. Then there's the ballet lessons, which are basically repeated footage from the first few episodes and Professor Cat (in English, mind you) saying something about vocabulary, and ending with an annoying, ""Or you will marry me!"" It doesn't teach anything, so I personally find it a waste of time and space on the disk.

2942926,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Don't be fooled by the title - this show is much more than your typical mahou shoujo (magical girl) anime.

Princess Tutu is an original story utilizing elements of traditional fairy tales and presented in the theatrical style of classical ballet (with an excellent score of classical music to match).  The story revolves around four students at the Kinkan (Gold Crown) Town ballet academy as they struggle to enact or refuse their fate at the hands of the sadistic storyteller, Drosselmeyer, all set against the backdrop of an epic battle between ""the prince"" and ""the raven"".  The tale waxes philosophical when the characters become aware of their identity as characters within a story, giving rise to questions of self-determination and reality.  The pace never lags, and the dark drama is balanced by just enough light moments of anime humor and fairy tale whimsy.  Stylistically, this series shines with its focused art direction and storytelling as well as its careful characterizations.

Princess Tutu is a beautiful artistic production and I highly recommended it for all fans of anime, fairy tales, ballet, theater, classical music, and well-crafted stories.  It is truly one of the most beautifully realized and inspired animes I have seen.

ABOUT THE PRODUCT

I own the Princess Tutu: Complete Collection (cover featuring Rue/Princess Kraehe).  Amazingly, after seeing it listed as ""out of stock"" on every DVD website, I recently found this product in store for $34.99 at Fry's Electronics.

The 6 DVDs come in a large plastic DVD case with two plastic flaps inside, rather than the typical decorated cardboard slip + folding case.  Both English and Japanese audio are available, and all episodes, TV specials, commentary and special features are included.  Good deal :)  I particularly like the Etudes summarizing the ballet themes of each episode, as well as ""Ballet for Beginners"" which describes a few common ballet moves.  There's a text only special on disc 5 called ""The Path to Tutu"" briefly describing the evolution of the show from Ikuko Itoh's initial idea.  Some of the commentary is fairly interesting/entertaining as well, although only one or two episodes out of 5 have commentary - the voice actors and staff pair up to do these on a rotating basis.  I also got a kick out of out-takes by Fakir's English voice actor (Chris Patton) and ""Kra-hey-hey"" (Kraehe).",1245715200,,2386,5.092544987146529

But give it a chance anyway and you'll find out it's really a story about storytelling itself.  Each episode starts with a snippet of fairy tale which gets woven into the story, and soon a bigger picture becomes apparent when you realise that the story is actually being manipulted by a Narrator who loves nothing better than a grand tragedy.  And about the characters who would rather make their own story.

Rarely have I seen an anime with this much depth, this many layers of meaning, not to mention the lovely music and dancing.

I'm kinda shocked at the professional review.  Sure there are a few un-neccessary filler episodes towards the beginning of each half season, but even these are used to develop the characters and lead the viewer gently into the main plot.",1240531200,2,965,4.641176470588236

2942932,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I have to disagree with the Amazon.com reviewer, Charles Solomon, that adolescent girls are the only audience for this show.

I research my anime carefully before watching, and the endlessly positive reviews by adults on this and other sites convinced me that this was worth a try. I'm so glad I did. It's rare to come across a piece of artwork that so elegantly combines classical music, dance and literature with modern art and entertainment styles.  Princess Tutu does this without ""dumbing down"" the classical elements for our modern, uncultured generation. In fact, it's the integrity and fullness of the classical works used in this show that make Princess Tutu so moving. As I watched, I found myself not only engrossed in the well-developed story and characters, but being washed away by the resonant, beautiful music and graceful choreography. The romantic-era music used in this show is highly emotive already, and the creators build on that to add a depth of emotion that couldn't have been achieved otherwise. I'll never be able to listen Tchaikovsky's ""Waltz of the Flowers"" without thinking of Princess Tutu.

There are definitely some aspects of Tutu that fall into anime stereotypes. A lot of people call this a majou shoujo (magical girl) show. I'm not big into the magical girl thing, and while the whole idea of duck transforming into Princess Tutu fits into that general mold, it didn't really feel like a magical girl anime to me. It felt more like a germanic fairy tale infused with the beauty of ballet and the storytelling inventiveness and artistic styling of anime. Any ""weirdness"" of the show makes sense when viewed in context of either ballet or the nature of the true plot that is driving this story...

Don't be deceived into thinking you'll be watching a show about a ballerina collecting pieces of heart. That's only one aspect of this multi-faceted tale. And the ending, while so bittersweet it makes you want to hit your head on a brick wall, makes complete sense to me. It couldn't have been any other way.

I've seen a lot of praise for the English dub. It's not bad, but several of the characters are so well voiced in Japanese that watching it in English just made it seem cheesy. My advice is that you watch this one subbed.

On an ending note...

I'm not sure who the graphic artist was for this box set, but numbskulls behind this design should be given 50 lashes and then dipped in boiling Tabasco sauce. And then fired. Forever. The first thing my wife said when we saw the cover was, ""It looks like a hooker in a cage."" It about ruined it for us. Besides just being plain ugly, it's poorly composed. This box set deserved a lot more. The excellent menus and special features almost make up for it, but not quite. I'm in the process of designing a different cover for my copy. Yes, it bothers me that much.

Glad I got that off my chest.",1219536000,11,2881,4.668639053254438
2942933,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I watched this after seeing a few clips that seemed interesting, and although I'm not a fan of ""Magical Girl"" shows, this is incredible.  It has an excellent score (featuring Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Beethoven, Dvorak, Saint-Seans, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin...), twines together lots of old fairy tales and legends, and the art (especially the ballet animation) is wonderful.  Alternatively off the wall and very serious (none of the 2-cent lessons that you get in other magical girl anime), with dynamic characters who evolve with the story...  it's just a shame so many will overlook this because of its genre and title!

Some of the usual magical trappings are there -- a transformation sequence for example, which usually comes towards the end of an episode -- but it's not 24 versions of the same episode plus a conclusion.  Sometimes three episodes might share the same formula, but never more than that, and even then the story moves in each episode.  How many anime can you say that for, in any genre?

And the weird costumes? And to be honest, I thought the first few episodes were exceedingly corny and not all that different from every other ""magical girl"" anime ever created.

But, the strange thing is, as I kept watching it, I found that it is very different. For starters, most animes fall into a pattern of bad thing happens, heroine pops up to solve bad thing, yay happy ending until the next episode. Princess Tutu starts this way--but then it breaks the pattern, and the audience begins to realize, just as the heroine does, that perhaps not all is as it seems.

Here's the basic story: a man named Drosselmeyer began writing a story about a Prince and a Raven, but before he could finish the story, he died--but the characters in the story became sick of not having an ending, so they leapt out of the story and into the town of Goldcrown. When this happens, Drosselmeyer's spirit awakes, and he realizes that, through the people of this town, he can continue his story. There is only one problem: he needs someone to play the role of Princess Tutu, the heroine who saves the Prince. He finds a duck, and he gives her a necklace to turn her into a girl and into Princess Tutu, the ballerina whose destiny it is to love the Prince but never confess that love, lest she turn into a speck of light and disappear.

It may sound strange, but it is a wonderful, deep story, going beyond just the surface of sadness, but into the darker realms of tragedy and despair--and then, in the end, emerging from both. It is a story of fairy tales, of loneliness and tragedy, of destiny and free will, of misconceptions, of doing what you believe is right, of learning you may be wrong, and above all, it is a story of hope.",1214870400,9,1892,4.415472779369628

The story is sweet and really gets interesting in the second half of the journey.  I particularly enjoyed the use of music and I found that I actually learned a lot about ballet in watching this.

....Aside from its title.
Do NOT get turned off by the title!

Princess Tutu follows the story of FOUR characters: Rue, Mytho, Fakir, and Ahiru (called ""Duck"" in the anime, the translators didn't bother beating around the bush with translating her name).

The dark tones and bittersweet victories make this anime about 400 times better than anything Disney has ever come up with.  The chemistry between characters is almost palatable, and by the end of the series, you will be rejoicing at its ending... yet in your heart desiring more.  (For those who know the jargon, its like ending a musical piece on a IV chord.  It leaves you craving a total resolution, yet satiates you with its hints of a tonic note.)

And the MUSIC!  I truly loved the selection of authentic classical music that served as the backdrop to this anime.  For those with a finer ear, you will notice times that the creators purpousfully cut a melody at the V chord, and let it hover in the air, as the scene transforms to a darker tone.  It is masterfully done, especially since these songs are often recognizable by both the professional and amateur musician.  For those that have no experience in music at all- you will STILL recognize much of the music, and the stuff you don't- get your hands on a copy of it.

2942954,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Princess Tutu is dreamlike show: elegant, wonderfully designed, filled with beautiful pieces of classical music and twisted storyline. There is a lot to recognize in fairy tales which are told by the show, yet a lot to discover anew within very well-known stories. A mysterious princess Tutu from an old tale who looks like your ordinary clumsy girl... who is actually a simple duck! She fights to get pieces of the prince's heart back together, but according to the tale has no hope for his love in return. Does Sleeping Beauty wants to be awaken? Is there a suffering heart behind a black witch mask? Who will come to Cinderella by the end of the day? It is not that simple as 'princess loves prince and they live happily ever after'. Yet it is about love expressed in ballet language.

DVD Collection contains 6 discs with the original context. Unlike most of the ADV packs here you will find all the extras such as staff commentary, ballet terms dictionary, short but neat descriptions of music pieces, etc. Besides as a bonus you will find here a disc with preview of the new ADV project ""Five Centimeters Per Second"". The only disappoinment is that the DVD design is not the original one (with wonderful bright shots of all the main characters). All discs are the same, without images of characters and follow the colors of the case's cover which consists mostly of dark brown background and white-pink and blue type with only volume numering different from disc to disc.
Aside of that, considering the fact that singles are almost non-available and the price of the collection is good this is a great 'must have' item.",1200873600,6,1625,4.721830985915493
2942955,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"This anime series is one of the best I've seen  - out of 26 episodes, only two could be called filler, and the rest followed a clear plot arc (two really, they can be taken together or separately) with excellent character development and tight storytelling.  The background music, mostly Romantic with an emphasis on Tchaikovsky's ballets, fits wonderfully with each scene, the voice acting is great (Duck's voice can be shrill but it fits her) and the subtitling is accurate and non-intrusive. I haven't watched the dub yet.

The story basis is a classic one of the humble duck who falls in love with a human prince, but this series goes beyond that - I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil anything.  I'll give a hint and say it becomes a story about stories.

I didn't give it 5 stars because the packaging is bare-bones (no booklet at all), but there are lots of extras on the DVDs such as commentary and the original commercials for the series.

Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone who likes a good story and doesn't mind (or prefers) animated series. Older kids would enjoy it as well, but it can be dark, so young children might be scared by some parts.",1200614400,7,1175,4.545023696682464
3177166,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Okay, the whole concept is weird at first, even by anime standards. There's a duck, who can turn into a girl with the help of a pendant. The pendant can also turn her into magical girl ballerina Princess Tutu. She's trying to bring the missing pieces of the prince's heart back to him. Fakir is the prince's bodyguard, trying to protect him at all costs. Kraehe is the prince's girlfriend, who can also turn into Tutu's arch-nemesis, Princess Kraehe.
Last but not least, the storyteller is manipulating all of them in every way he can, to make the most tragic story of all time. He has magical jewels, curses and the power to stop time. The storyteller died before he could finish his last story, so to make up for it, he's returning back from the dead to toy with real people as actors for the story.
Yes, the story is really bizarre. It reminds me of a twisted, fairy-tale version of ""The Truman Show."" While a production like this could easily fall apart, the animators pull off a splendid job with the characters. Ahiru looks amazingly cute and pretty as the heroine duck/ballerina and all the other characters have distinguished designs as well.
I had a blast watching the story unfold. I never thought that shoujo characters could show this much emotion. I especially loved the evil storyteller, who hides in the background as the ""intelligent designer""--literally.
I never thought I would love a pseudo-magical girl anime this much. I guess this is the best ballet anime ever made...now that's a first.",1200096000,7,1509,4.741444866920152

3177168,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"First off, before I review this, I have to say, Princess Tutu is my FAVORITE anime. Ever. And I've seen a lot. It's fantastic, and I think everyone should see it.

I'm not sure how to summarize the story. It's very complex and engaging. I have to mention first, this anime is very much like a fairy tale. (in fact it uses a lot of Germanic legend and folklore as inspiration) It focuses on a girl, who is really a duck, named Duck, who is in love with a Prince without a heart. She is given a pendant by a man named Drosselmeyer, who is the man pulling the strings behind the whole story. The pendant allows her to take the form of a human girl. This pendant also allows her to turn into Princess Tutu. While Duck is Princess Tutu, she can search for and retrieve shards of the Prince's heart. Throughout the series, Duck must face different obstacles, such a Knight whose role in the story is ambiguous at first, (is he friend or foe?) another Princess who claims the Prince is hers, and various people under the influence of the heart shards of the Prince. I won't say more than that, because I'm afraid I'll spoil this amazing story.

Keep in mind, Princess Tutu does have quite a bit of dancing, many episodes draw inspiration from famous ballets, and music from those ballets is used throughout the series. However, the dancing is beautiful, and even if you aren't familiar with ballet, the extras are there to help you.

This is the first boxset that ADV has done right. (at least from the dvds I've bought from them) They haven't stripped the extras, and there are a lot of them. Some of the extras include ""Ballet for Beginners,"" (which explains the different ballet that are mentioned/used in the series) commentary from the voice actors and staff, outtakes, and tv promos, among other things.

I really can't say enough good things about this anime. At first glance, it may seem childish, but if you stick with it, there are a lot of mature themes going on throughout the anime. It has so many levels to it...it's simply amazing, that's all I can say. I'd recommend this for 13+ for some violence blood, and chaste nudity.

3177169,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"This is a great series and yes it does have a goofy kid like name to it. But don't let that fool you. This series is a total HIDDEN GEM. I love anime but i don't track how well a series does in DVD sales. I believe the individual DVDs are discontinued. But get this box set which contains seasons 1 & 2 and for the current sale price its almost 1.00 per episode. The story is about a girl name Duck who is actually a DUCK but turns into a girl when a story teller grants her a wish. She utilizes her time as a girl drooling over the cutest guy at school but the boy has a SECRET. Along with being able to be a girl she can transform into Princess Tutu where she must help save the prince & get back the shards to his scattered heart. This series has it all and the best thing is, it has MYSTERY which kept my attention. Alot of these new anime titles lately really don't have an ENGAGING element to keep me attracted. Princess TuTu kept me glued to the screen the WHOLE TIME. Its also directed by the creator of Sailor Moon so it has that magic touch already. Surprisingly alot of new anime titles created past the year 2000 have a certain drawing style to it and it doesnt seem to have the colorful VIBRANT images of series that was animated in the 1990's.

I wish the set came with a bit more than just the discs, but it's well worth it for the price, especially since the single discs are becoming hard to find.",1195084800,21,526,4.666666666666667

The series splits into 2 parts: Chapter of Egg and Chapter of Fledgling (which is arguably when the story really ""takes flight""). While the ending of each season may only suit a particular audience, those who detect the strong symbolism underneath each individual episode will be quite satisfied with the finale.

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves symbolism, a surprise ending, and sadistic storytellers; of which is our beloved Drosselmeyer's tale of Princess Tutu!",1194480000,17,750,5.294117647058823

3177208,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"While I've grown up with and always considered myself a fan of anime, there still remains a great many series I've yet to watch. So I've been slowly chipping away at a rather long ""to watch"" list.  Being a fan of the ""magical girl"" genre (with shows such as Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew), I decided to take a look at this short, but noteworthy show; wondering why more than a few people were hailing it as one of the best animes they ever watched.

While I wouldn't go so far as to call it the best anime I've ever seen, it's certainly a step above your typical superhero/fantasy show, with a semi-complicated plot, and three dimensional characters that explore what it truly means to love someone and have free will.

Once there was a writer named Drosselmeyer, who had the power to make his stories come to life. But he died before he could finish his final tale, ""The Prince and The Raven"", leaving the two titular characters locked in an eternal battle. After many years, the Raven managed to break free into the real world, and the Prince pursued him. To seal away the Raven's evil, Prince Mytho shattered his own heart with his sword, causing him to lose all his memories and emotions. Drosselmeyer, now a ghost, decides the story must have an ending. He finds it in the form of a little duck, who has fallen in love with Mytho. He gives her a magic pendant that can transform her into a human girl, and then into the graceful ballerina, Princess Tutu. It then falls on Duck to find all the scattered shards of Mytho's heart and return them to him. But her mission is beset by more than a few challenges; the foremost being that if Mytho regains his heart, it also means unleashing the evil Raven. Add to it a cynical knight, the Raven's scheming daughter, and the fact that if Tutu professes her love for the Prince, she'll turn into a speck of light--and Duck realizes she'll have to gather all her courage to ensure the story has a happy ending.

Anyone who's a fan of a good old fashioned fairy tale will greatly enjoy this series, as the entire story is mainly told through ballet, with a wide range of classical musical scores from various plays, ballets, and dances peppered in each episode and helping tell the tale. Admittedly, the first few episodes can be kind of confusing to sit through, when the audience is treated to a world where humans and anthropomorphic animals live side by side without batting an eyelash. But gradually, the town's weirdness DOES get explained, though I won't spoil it.

But what really makes this series great is its characters. Duck is a sweet and caring girl, who battles darkness through the art of dance, and talking down her enemies, rather than just delivering a smackdown--something you don't often see in most television. Mytho starts off as an emotionless robot, but as more of his heart is put back together, the more heroic he becomes. And Fakir the knight, and Rue, the Raven's daughter, who both start off as practically villains, turn out to not be so bad or heartless as once believed. If anything, it's Drosselmeyer who's the true menacing presence, as he takes great joy in manipulating the characters and toying with their lives, causing all the key players to have to unite to carve out their own ending, rather than just follow the fates they were given.

A magical girl ballet with a Brothers Grimm edge, this is one anime that deserved to go on a bit longer. With deep themes about true love and defying fate, and an unexpected ending, this is one series that can stand up there with the best fairy tales.",1458777600,,3574,4.559190031152648
3177209,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I would give it 10 if I could.  I love all the features, bonus episodes, clips of seeing the voice actors, the commentary, and everything.

3177210,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"The five star rating on this review is for the show itself. It's an excellent dark twist on the Magical Girl genre, playing out like a Grimm Bros. fairy tale, and an excellent one at that. However, it's still unclear if Aesir Holdings will update the packaging for the DVDs. This will be the fourth complete collection for this show. The first box set produced in 2007, by the now defunct ADV, is so far the only one that's packaged well, using plastic pages to hold the discs inside of a large DVD case. The other two sets released since have been stack-packs; a case with a deep spindle where all the DVDs sit on top of each other. These are notoriously bad for holding discs, and they WILL get scratched, no matter how careful you are with them. If the producers for the show change the packaging to the page method, then picking this up will be a no-brainer; but if not, then it may still be worth it to track down the 2007 set. I will say however, that the box and disc art for this new set are big improvements over the previous releases. Also, it looks like every bonus material item will be included like in the past releases, which is a big plus. The show itself is perfection, but only time will tell if it's worth it to get this set if you already own it.

Update (3/15/16): I received my copy of this early, and I'm happy to annouce that the case uses a page setup similar to the 2007 set, albeit about 3x thinner (more shelf space). With that being said, I highly recommend this new collection if you own either the 2009 or 2011 stackpack release, as chances are, your discs are probably a bit worse for wear at this point (if you haven't swapped the case out). With the vast amount of content you get in this release, the price is extremely low. I highly recommend this new release of Princess Tutu, and I recommend it to fans of the show, fans of magical girl anime, and those who simply enjoy a good story.",1456704000,18,1922,4.294765840220386

And truly, has there ever been a villain more charming and memorable than Drosselmeyer? But seriously, the metafictional narrative and blurring of fiction and reality was just a treat for anyone who is interested in writing, reading, and the conventions of stories.

And I gotta say, Fakir went from being an annoying stereotype to having one of the most satisfying character arcs I've ever had the pleasure to witness. The other character arcs weren't quite as original, but that's no obstacle for being satisfying and well-executed, with their own lovely little details that make them memorable.

At first glance, this series can look like your usual 'shoujo' (girl manga/anime) magic girl story but it goes beyond that, mixing fairy tales, story telling, ballet and music. It is filled with beauty, grace and poetry. Moments are very emotional, others are pretty silly.

3177257,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I would like to start off by saying that no matter how you buy this series (be it the DVD singles, or any of the three available Complete Collections), you will receive a fantastic anime series with ALL of the bonus content. Don't let the title fool you, as this show isn't just a simple magical girl series; it's a tragic fairy tale set to classical music and ballet. The music in this series is a huge selling point, and it makes every scene more powerful, more touching, and even more heartbreaking. Princess Tutu is easily an anime classic, and deserves more recognition than it gets. (Please be aware however: due to setting up the story, the first 2-3 episodes are a lot more like a typical magical girl series; it needs time to gather all the pieces together.) I could go on, but there are much better written reviews here already to tell you everything you need to know. This review will focus on the different packaging of the series, and how it will affect you.

This series, like many others, was first released in DVD volumes. These 6 DVDs all come with reversible cover art, one side with a light theme, and one side with a dark theme. In 2007, ADV released the first complete set for Region 1. Unlike their previous collections, this set retained all of the extra features the singles had (there are *tons* of extras for this series, which the other sets also retain). This is the set I specifically sought out for myself, and I'll tell you why. Even though the box art is extremely misleading, with Rue in a revealing outfit on the cover; and even though the brown (with pink and blue accents) color design is horrible for this show, this Complete Collection is packaged well. Let me explain: both the 2009 and 2011 collections for this show are stackpacks (a case with a deep spindle where all 6 discs are stacked on top of each other). Stackpacks are notorious for damaging discs. No matter how gently you treat them, the discs will rub against each other and scratch. The 2007 set's discs are connected to plastic pages inside the case, with individual holding slots.

If you can manage to find a copy of the 2007 set somewhere (I'm pretty sure Amazon currently has no more), or all 6 DVD volumes, these are the best ways to buy this wonderful series and keep it pristine and watchable forever. Another option is to buy the newest set and replace the case, however these replacement cases can often be flimsy and unreliable.

BTW, I recommend the dub. Luci Christian plays an endearing Duck (or Ahiru, if you prefer), and flawlessly converts her lovable voice into Tutu's, which is soft and sweet. Every other character, from the mysterious narrator, the wonderful Mr. Cat, and the devious Drosselmeyer is voiced perfectly in the dub version of this show, leading to total immersion as you lose yourself in the magic of Princess Tutu.

Not convinced? As of right now, you can watch the (dubbed) show for FREE on Hulu! Give it a go and decide for yourself!

Edit: (12-3-14) I provided some customer images with my review, but they don't seem to be working properly. They were fine a few days ago, but are now unavailable. Huh. :/

Edit: (1-10-16) The show is going to be released again this year. Whether or not it will be a stackpack remains to be said, but if it's not, I highly recommend ordering it when it becomes available!

3177276,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"The three young girls who received this as a gift absolutely love it.  As an adult who sometimes enjoys anime, it wasn't for me.

The story? All the other reviews I'd encountered talked it up as deep many-nuanced storyline. The adults here found the main character Duck obnoxious with voice acting on the shrill/grating side (and expect to hear this entirely too much). None of us was very interested in the opening storyline involving 7-9 year old girls living in dorms and attending a ballet academy.

The kids on the hand were enthralled.  ""She turns into a duck!""  and  ""Can we watch Princess Tutu more?"" Enough said.  Some of the girls even started to imitate the dances, which as a supervising adult (to me) meant this series has like 1000% more usefulness and inspirational impact than the usual Disney cartoon.

Rated four stars because of kids -- I like how they liked it.",1402358400,,881,4.712418300653595

Personally, I don't think anyone should buy a boxset of an anime they've never seen before since they tend to be pricey and no one wants to buy an anime they're gonna end up hating. So if you saw this anime online, on Netflix or whatever other source before, you shouldn't be disappointed by the series itself.

The only qualm I have is with the packaging. When you open up the DVD, all of the discs are piled on top of each other on the same platform. I just think that's lazy and they could have had all the discs separately secured for better protection against each other, but as long as you're careful taking out the disks, you should be fine.

I ordered it right away and waited impatiently for it only to frown heavily at the method of which they gave me my DVDs.

All 6 of them stacked on top of one another in a huge box (with a chunk of foam?! No booklets or episode guides??) that could have very easily had separate spot casings placed within. Thankfully nothing was scratched or broken but honestly, there's no excuse for that. It was cheap and the kinda thing I'd expect to see from a bootleg copy seller.

I'm heavily disappointed and had to purchase separate DVD casings for them to prevent any damage that might come from leaving them like that. I suggest you fix that issue right away before you end up with a LOT of returns thanks to bad packaging.",1391644800,12,934,4.331428571428572

Sailor Moon fans may recognize the art style of creator Ikuko Itoh, one of the original animators for the Sailor Moon anime.

The disks aren't damaged, but they will be soon, with this set up, and it is a pain to get to my favorite episodes, which are at the bottom. I am going to have to buy separate cases for each disk, which is inconvenient and a waste of my time and money, especially since the box has more than enough room to keep each disk separate due to its size.

3177310,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"This is one of those rare shows that is able to combine multiple contrasting themes and motifs into a single beautiful storyline; and I wish anime and non-anime fans would watch, because it's that good. The idea of using classical ballet and old-style fairy tales, in a TV show much less an anime, sounds like a recipe for disaster, but in this instance is done masterfully. It may seem odd to use ballet as a means of solving a conflict but by the fourth episode, it feels very organic, as opposed to just a gimmick.

  Also, other than the works of Hayao Miyazaki, this is the only movie/TV show that has the same feel to it as an old fairy tale. As I watch it it is very evocative of the stories of Hans Christian Anderson or George MacDonald. Princess Tutu demonstrates a better understanding, I think, of fairy tales than Walt Disney or for that matter how to utilize classical music in an animated medium; how the show weaves various classical pieces into the storyline is done so well, you do not think anything sticks out oddly even when they play extremely well known pieces of music.

  I would recommend buying the DVD set, since it's cheap firstly, but also it has a wealth of useful special features. As, to what age group this would be acceptable for, 12-13 would be fine in my opinion, although I wouldn't suggest using it for an elementary music class (both my parents are music teachers ergo the scenario of using this to expose children to classical music instantly crosses my mind by reflex) because of a few things which some might object to, or some children may not be mature enough to deal with (although the outtakes and commentary of the special features are a definite TV-14 rating I'd say). The things that will make you want to watch a few episodes before you decide if your kids can watch this show are thus: what another reviewer referred to as 'chaste nudity' which is quite apt (effectively brief partial nudity/ nude silhouette) but there is no hint of sexuality during the entire series, I believe a few instances of mild cursing, mild violence, and some 'dark' subject matter ::MILD SPOILER:: ( a character is motivated by fear of a 'father' figure).
All in all, this is a fantastic series for just about everyone that I can't recommend highly enough, but for children 12 or younger, you will want to make sure you deem it appropriate yourself; although I think this series would make an excellent introduction into the world of classical music and dance (Some of the special features look like they were probably made for that purpose in mind).",1378598400,,2580,4.622270742358078

The anime is just beatiful, and not at all what you'd expect from the title. Oh, yes, it has lots of prettiness and cuteness to it, but it gets dark fast. Think Puella Magi Madoka Magica. This is an anime I'd recommend to pretty much anyone. It never gets so dark that kids can't enjoy it, but never gets so sappy that adults can't enjoy it.

It's also an incredibly rich and moving experience, combining classic ballet music and stories in a new way that makes them fresh and exciting.

The story can be watched by kids as just a fairy tale, albeit a darker one in the latter half. Or you can watch as an adult and the latter episodes will take you as deep as you want to go. It really made me sit and think about what I write and what exactly is writing me.

3177332,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I know what you're thinking...Princess Tutu?  My family thinks that I've gone off the deep end when I said I loved this show.  Let me start off by saying that Princess Tutu is a well thought, deeply engaging and dark story in the format of a fairy tale.  Everything about the show is perfect, from the characters to the voice actors, the story to the music (all classical).  Everything clicks, and if you give it a chance it will not disappoint you (as long as you have a high tolerance for the strange).

The story is about a girl named Duck, who is actually a duck, but has been given the opportunity to be a girl and become Princess Tutu in order to help restore the shattered heart of the prince, Mytho.  The thing is, the person who granted her this power is the dead author of a story, the Prince and the Raven, and Mytho is the actual prince escaped from the story.  Along the way, Duck has to deal with the challenges of an overprotective knight (Fakir) and an evil Princess (Rue) who are determined to keep Mytho's heart in pieces.  The end result is a story that is wonderfully endearing and deep on many levels, and begs the question, how much are these characters in control of their own fate within the lines of the Prince and the Raven?

Despite fitting the model of a magic girl anime, Princess Tutu is far from the norm of the genre.  With rich influences of fairy tales like Brothers Grimm, as well as classical influences of ballet and music, this anime-turned-metafiction is just about one of the best shows I've ever seen.  Trust me, give it a try if you have any doubt.  Princess Tutu is awesome!",1357344000,,1617,4.407407407407407

What anime has a ballerina as a main character who defends the hearts of not only her friends but heals the heart of a prince? AND SHES ACTUALLY A DUCK! Even cooler. Come on, you know you want to watch this adorable show. Guy or girl, this show is awesome. I cant say anything about the english voices, I always like the Japanese voices myself, but that is just me. The music is sweet, I love the main intro song. I could listen to it a thousand times. The characters are hilarious and it's so crazy that no one realizes their teacher is a CAT! He is my favorite. Sounds crazy huh? BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GREAT! Its random, but really funny and sweet.

The ending is very unexpected, and the journey Princess Tutu takes to get there is a wonderful experience and a fun tale. GREAT ANIME! Give it a chance! It may sound silly, but it is a great anime. Trust me!",1348617600,,998,4.252631578947368

It's a whimsical anime with personified animals and humans coexisting. The soundtrack is also about 99% classical music.
Tutu is pretty dark, which is partly why it's rated TV-14. There's also some immodestly dressed girls, a somewhat objectified prince, profanity, and a giant phantasmal raven. There's no sex, but by American standards, this is not for kids.",1345334400,,714,4.958333333333333

I'm partially relying on the judgement of my daughter's friend's parents as they seem to have very similar values as my husband and I.  I was assured they find the material appropriate.

The reason any parent should be hesitant or at least aware is because this is authentic Japanese anime....and one has to be careful when dealing with such.  Yes, some of the characters are scantily dressed but my girls even commented on that to me as their only complaint.  I've come to accept, though not entirely approve, that comes along with this genre of entertainment/art.

3177360,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"Look, I was skeptical about this series too, but someone I respected recommended the series to me so I checked it out on Netflix.

Is it cutesy? Yes. Is the story really simple? Yes, of course, it's for kids. Does it talk down to children? Never. It's goofy sometimes, heartwarming sometimes, and over-all it has a lot of things that are clearly for little children.

That said, while it may be simple it's never simplistic. It's not pandering like most little kids shows are (especially shows intended for girls). The music is wonderful, with some of the best classical ballet pieces in the world presented. The art is amazing, even if the animation is sometimes minimalistic, and the parts where they obviously had budget problems are seamlessly integrated with some very well edited still frame shots which are downright gorgeous.

A few things to keep in mind: This is not a ""Magical Girl"" anime like Sailor Moon. It's a FAIRY TALE, and I mean closer to like what the Brothers Grimm would have written rather than the sappy stuff we tend to show our kids. There is some implied nudity, but you never see any naughty bits. There are some situations that will be, to small children, either confusing or disturbing. If you're not sure, watch it first, but I'd go so far as to say that there isn't anything inappropriate in here... But someone more prudish might disagree with me.

The first few episodes start off slowly, and there's a fair amount of WTF involved in it, but if you stick with it you will be rewarded with something really quite wonderful. Give it a shot. Ignore the name, I know ""Princess Tutu"" sounds silly but it works for what they were going for.",1329264000,3,1668,4.6440677966101696
3177361,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I'll tell you a secret. The reason we nerds buy up so many cartoons on DVD is not just because we love these programs so much. Though that's certainly part of it. The reason we buy so many DVDs is because we want to someday watch them with our children. Because, let's face it, TV nowadays sucks. So, be it ""Batman the Animated Series"" or ""Dragon Ball Z"" our kids are going to grow up right! But, there's one thing nagging us in the back of our minds. One thing we don't want to admit to ourselves, but I'll say it right here right now, ""What if we have daughters?""

I can't watch ""Die Hard"" with a daughter!

There is only one alternative. Those of us who are secure enough in our manhood need to diversify our collections to plan for the unthinkable. We need to buy some cartoons that aren't specifically aimed at boys. And my brief, but impartial, research has pointed me to ""Princess Tutu.""

Princess Tutu is a unique Magical Girl anime. It's about a girl named Duck, who transforms into Princess Tutu to save her would-be boyfriend, Mytho, a boy who has lost all of his feelings. But, it's much deeper than that. The whole story is actually a fairy tale, and the characters are characters from the story come to life.

What makes this series worth owning is the dedication poured into every aspect of the production. The series parallels several different fairy tales, plays, and ballets. Nearly all of the music has been lifted from appropriate ballets. You don't have to be a ballet aficionado to appreciate it, several of the special features are dedicated to explaining these things.

Each disk is packed with special features. While some anime have 1 episode with commentary every 13 episodes, there is one commentary track on each disk. Plus, ""Ballet for Beginners"" with the characters explaining some basic ballet terms. ""Etude"" which explains where the music you hear comes from. ""In the Booth"" with the voice actors. Plus, several specials and notes on the production. Seldom do anime get this type of treatment in the American release, so it's good to see that ADV went all out.

In summation, Princess Tutu is a great series with superb special features. The only downside is that it does come shipped in a spindle pack. All the disks are stacked up on top of each other, instead of being separate or in thin packs. It was my experience that only one disk was knocked loose during shipping, and still played fine. You can remedy your dilemma by simply storing them in different cases after you receive them. If you plan to wait for it to simply be repackaged, there's no way of knowing when that will be, or if they'll carry over the same special features.

Yu Yu Hakusho used to have commentary when it was originally released, but doesn't in the new think pack release.

Don't miss a chance to own one of the best Shojo anime of the last decade. Your future daughters will thank you.

And now to wait for Hasbro to release ""Friendship is Magic.""",1327708800,8,2963,4.586011342155009

Both my daughter and I found this to be a disappointment.  We purchased a 6 disk case form Comp USA to remedy the situation.  Though we now have an extra 9 cases as they only came in a 10 pack.  Second, they did not include an insert listing what is on each of the 6 disks.  I have to admit that my daughter has the series memorized and that it is not a problem for her.  If you are new to Princess Tutu it could be disappointing and a little daunting to have to plunge in without a guide of some sort.

Overall the quality of the set is good and it has most of what we look for with optional language and subtitles.  Also there are bonus features that are nice to see.

I love anime, but i don't track how well a series does in DVD sales. I believe the individual DVDs are discontinued at this time, but get this box set which contains seasons 1 & 2. Especially for the current sale price its almost 1.00 per episode. The story is about a girl named, Duck, who is actually a DUCK. However, she turns into a girl when a story teller grants her a wish. She utilizes her time as a girl drooling over the cutest guy at school, but only to find out the boy has a HUGE SECRET.

Along with being able to be a girl, she can transform into Princess Tutu where she must help save the prince & get back the shards to his scattered heart. This series has it all and the best thing is, it has MYSTERY which kept my attention. The show takes classic fairty tales that children grew up with and twists the conventional knowledge of what we know and gives it a tractured touch. Alot of these new anime titles lately really don't have an ENGAGING element to keep me attracted. Princess TuTu kept me glued to the screen the WHOLE TIME. I had a marathon and went from episode to episode one night. The show is the classic take on good versus evil. The ending is a SHOCKER. It's also directed by the direcor of Sailor Moon (season one) so it has that magic touch already. Surprisingly, alot of new anime titles created past the year 2000 have a certain drawing style to it. They no longer seems to have that VIBRANT color scheme, like anime series that were created in the 1990's. Overall i am so pleased with my purchase and i love the PRICE that i got it at.

I cannot say enough good things about this anime. People might initially view it as childish or too girly... but there are a lot of dark themes that come up in this series. It is definitely not a child's anime.

As mentioned already, the ballet theme coupled with the fairy tale settings make for a beautiful set for an anime like no other I have ever seen. Sure, it's got similar themes like shoujo or magical-girl... but the way they pull it off is so beautiful and amazing. The characters are endearing... I believe I cared about every central character that appeared in the series (which is rather rare for me). The story is rich with emotions very powerful. There is nothing shallow about this anime at all. There is nothing sickly sweet or corny or embarrassing about this anime. In fact, I would recommend everyone and anyone who likes anime and can at least try expanding their horizons beyond the standard samurai, mecha and ecchi fare to give this series a try.

It is not only worth buying. It's worth keeping around for a lifetime.",1320451200,,1208,4.587962962962963
3177375,3,B000VKJ6Z4,"I'd read about Princess Tutu on a couple of the anime sites, and it was highly recommended wherever I saw it mentioned. I love ballet, so buying the set seemed to be a no-brainer. When I began watching the series, I wasn't so sure. I'm an adult, and it seemed too shojo (for young girls) to me. I thought that Duck's voice was too shrill, and the boys were too pretty.  However, having already spent money on it, I stuck to it, and I was well rewarded. Duck's voice grew on me, especially her expressive quacking. The pretty boys turned out to be more troubled and complex than they initially appeared. And, wonderfully, the representation of ballet was perfect. It's not that everything was animated. This is TV anime, not studio Ghibli art. However, the characters' ballet positions were perfect, and the limited animation somehow did suggest the beauty of ballet.

Princess Tutu is a fairy tale constructed out of several fairy tales and told in the world of ballet and through ballet. As we all know, fairy tales have some very dark themes. The story delves into subjects such as self sacrifice on behalf of others and free will as well as peaceful and non-peaceful methods of conflict resolution. The main character is Duck, a duck who is given a pendant that turns her into a human girl, and under certain circumstances, a sort of super hero ballerina. Most of the characters are humans, but an occasional talking and dancing animal slips in, as does a puppet or two.

The music is a vital component of the anime. The soundtrack is composed of famous (Western) classical music including selections from Tchaikovsky's ballets, the opera Carmen, and Pictures at an Exhibition. The music is great, but if you are familiar with the pieces, the juxtaposition of music by different composers may jar you a little. The music goes together well, but the switch from one composer to another caught me by surprise, here and there.

I thought that the extras were exceptionally interesting. Some of the episodes had commentary by the writers and translators as well as the English voice actors. There were also little animated lessons about ballet.

Regarding the packaging, add me to the list of people who hated the spooled stack of the six disks. This packaging inhibits access and is probably more conducive to scratching the disks than most arrangements. Also, if there was a way to listen to the DVDs dubbed in English and with subtitles, I didn't figure it out. The disk menu did show subtitles with the Japanese language version.

This anime grows on one as it progresses. I would state that it IS more for girls than boys, but there is much in it that a boy could enjoy and relate to. Give it a shot!",1319587200,8,2704,4.694092827004219
3177376,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"I remember watching this series several years ago and am now able to share it with my young daughter who loves the show, and has fallen in love with the quirky storyline, the captivating characters, as well as the ballet and classical-music infused into the series.

The story of Princess Tutu centers on a young teen named Ahiru (which translates into `duck' in Japanese).  This young girl is actually a duck who has been transformed into a girl and it becomes apparent early on in the show that Ahiru has some sort of destiny to fulfill. Ahiru studies classical ballet at a private school and develops a deep crush on a strange young man, Mytho. It turns out that Mytho's heart is in pieces and it is up to Ahiru to restore his feelings. Of course, there are several antagonists that try to prevent Ahiru from achieving her goal. Fortunately, Ahiru is also able to transform into the magical prima ballerina Princess Tutu, and this helps her to gradually fulfill her mission.

There are many layers to this story, and just when you think you've figured everything out, there are interesting twists and developments that keep the story fresh and interesting. Adults will delight in the use of classical music and ballet moves as well as the richly-layered plot. Children like my young daughter will be enchanted by the quirky cast of characters, the cute mannerisms, and of course the vibrant colors that infuse this enchanting anime production. The soundtrack is equally compelling, especially ""Morning Grace"" by Ritsuko Okazaki.",1311552000,2,1531,4.903474903474904

The characters are genuine and likable, and are given a chance to change and evolve throughout the series. I will avoid giving away any spoilers, but as this seemingly simple fairytale unfolds there are more layers and surprises around each corner.

This show is something that could be enjoyed by both kids and adults, it is geared more towards girls but it is not so horribly feminine that a more receptive guy couldn't enjoy it. If you are a fan of ballet, or like another look at the show, I really enjoyed re-watching the episodes with commentary. The (English) cast takes turns talking about the actual music and dances behind the shows, which I found really fascinating.

The only real downside that I found to the show is that the first episode is a bit annoying, but after that I fell in love! If you give this anime a try, don't get detured by episode one if you find it a bit annoying, it really is a good show.",1292803200,3,1223,4.529411764705882

I'm so glad that I did.

I burned through watching the entire series in two days. There was a lot that I'd forgotten about the story of Duck, Fakir, Rue and Mytho. I'd forgotten how funny Mr Cat was. How creepy Drosselmeyer could be. How controlling Fakir was over Mytho in the beginning. How complex Rue's story was. How delightful Ahiru/Duck could be in all her awkward earnestness.

I've only gotten up to around episode 14 but I've fallen in love.

My only complaint I have is on the English dub and the 'Beginner Ballet' lessons. The English voice cast take 'weird' to the extreme with their either extremely high, low, squeaky, or tired voices, and it causes distraction. So normally I just turn on the subtitles and switch it to Japanese, which sounds much more pleasing to the ears. Then there's the ballet lessons, which are basically repeated footage from the first few episodes and Professor Cat (in English, mind you) saying something about vocabulary, and ending with an annoying, ""Or you will marry me!"" It doesn't teach anything, so I personally find it a waste of time and space on the disk.

3177423,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Don't be fooled by the title - this show is much more than your typical mahou shoujo (magical girl) anime.

Princess Tutu is an original story utilizing elements of traditional fairy tales and presented in the theatrical style of classical ballet (with an excellent score of classical music to match).  The story revolves around four students at the Kinkan (Gold Crown) Town ballet academy as they struggle to enact or refuse their fate at the hands of the sadistic storyteller, Drosselmeyer, all set against the backdrop of an epic battle between ""the prince"" and ""the raven"".  The tale waxes philosophical when the characters become aware of their identity as characters within a story, giving rise to questions of self-determination and reality.  The pace never lags, and the dark drama is balanced by just enough light moments of anime humor and fairy tale whimsy.  Stylistically, this series shines with its focused art direction and storytelling as well as its careful characterizations.

Princess Tutu is a beautiful artistic production and I highly recommended it for all fans of anime, fairy tales, ballet, theater, classical music, and well-crafted stories.  It is truly one of the most beautifully realized and inspired animes I have seen.

ABOUT THE PRODUCT

I own the Princess Tutu: Complete Collection (cover featuring Rue/Princess Kraehe).  Amazingly, after seeing it listed as ""out of stock"" on every DVD website, I recently found this product in store for $34.99 at Fry's Electronics.

The 6 DVDs come in a large plastic DVD case with two plastic flaps inside, rather than the typical decorated cardboard slip + folding case.  Both English and Japanese audio are available, and all episodes, TV specials, commentary and special features are included.  Good deal :)  I particularly like the Etudes summarizing the ballet themes of each episode, as well as ""Ballet for Beginners"" which describes a few common ballet moves.  There's a text only special on disc 5 called ""The Path to Tutu"" briefly describing the evolution of the show from Ikuko Itoh's initial idea.  Some of the commentary is fairly interesting/entertaining as well, although only one or two episodes out of 5 have commentary - the voice actors and staff pair up to do these on a rotating basis.  I also got a kick out of out-takes by Fakir's English voice actor (Chris Patton) and ""Kra-hey-hey"" (Kraehe).",1245715200,,2386,5.092544987146529

But give it a chance anyway and you'll find out it's really a story about storytelling itself.  Each episode starts with a snippet of fairy tale which gets woven into the story, and soon a bigger picture becomes apparent when you realise that the story is actually being manipulted by a Narrator who loves nothing better than a grand tragedy.  And about the characters who would rather make their own story.

Rarely have I seen an anime with this much depth, this many layers of meaning, not to mention the lovely music and dancing.

I'm kinda shocked at the professional review.  Sure there are a few un-neccessary filler episodes towards the beginning of each half season, but even these are used to develop the characters and lead the viewer gently into the main plot.",1240531200,2,965,4.641176470588236

3177429,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I have to disagree with the Amazon.com reviewer, Charles Solomon, that adolescent girls are the only audience for this show.

I research my anime carefully before watching, and the endlessly positive reviews by adults on this and other sites convinced me that this was worth a try. I'm so glad I did. It's rare to come across a piece of artwork that so elegantly combines classical music, dance and literature with modern art and entertainment styles.  Princess Tutu does this without ""dumbing down"" the classical elements for our modern, uncultured generation. In fact, it's the integrity and fullness of the classical works used in this show that make Princess Tutu so moving. As I watched, I found myself not only engrossed in the well-developed story and characters, but being washed away by the resonant, beautiful music and graceful choreography. The romantic-era music used in this show is highly emotive already, and the creators build on that to add a depth of emotion that couldn't have been achieved otherwise. I'll never be able to listen Tchaikovsky's ""Waltz of the Flowers"" without thinking of Princess Tutu.

There are definitely some aspects of Tutu that fall into anime stereotypes. A lot of people call this a majou shoujo (magical girl) show. I'm not big into the magical girl thing, and while the whole idea of duck transforming into Princess Tutu fits into that general mold, it didn't really feel like a magical girl anime to me. It felt more like a germanic fairy tale infused with the beauty of ballet and the storytelling inventiveness and artistic styling of anime. Any ""weirdness"" of the show makes sense when viewed in context of either ballet or the nature of the true plot that is driving this story...

Don't be deceived into thinking you'll be watching a show about a ballerina collecting pieces of heart. That's only one aspect of this multi-faceted tale. And the ending, while so bittersweet it makes you want to hit your head on a brick wall, makes complete sense to me. It couldn't have been any other way.

I've seen a lot of praise for the English dub. It's not bad, but several of the characters are so well voiced in Japanese that watching it in English just made it seem cheesy. My advice is that you watch this one subbed.

On an ending note...

I'm not sure who the graphic artist was for this box set, but numbskulls behind this design should be given 50 lashes and then dipped in boiling Tabasco sauce. And then fired. Forever. The first thing my wife said when we saw the cover was, ""It looks like a hooker in a cage."" It about ruined it for us. Besides just being plain ugly, it's poorly composed. This box set deserved a lot more. The excellent menus and special features almost make up for it, but not quite. I'm in the process of designing a different cover for my copy. Yes, it bothers me that much.

Glad I got that off my chest.",1219536000,11,2881,4.668639053254438
3177430,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"I watched this after seeing a few clips that seemed interesting, and although I'm not a fan of ""Magical Girl"" shows, this is incredible.  It has an excellent score (featuring Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Beethoven, Dvorak, Saint-Seans, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin...), twines together lots of old fairy tales and legends, and the art (especially the ballet animation) is wonderful.  Alternatively off the wall and very serious (none of the 2-cent lessons that you get in other magical girl anime), with dynamic characters who evolve with the story...  it's just a shame so many will overlook this because of its genre and title!

Some of the usual magical trappings are there -- a transformation sequence for example, which usually comes towards the end of an episode -- but it's not 24 versions of the same episode plus a conclusion.  Sometimes three episodes might share the same formula, but never more than that, and even then the story moves in each episode.  How many anime can you say that for, in any genre?

And the weird costumes? And to be honest, I thought the first few episodes were exceedingly corny and not all that different from every other ""magical girl"" anime ever created.

But, the strange thing is, as I kept watching it, I found that it is very different. For starters, most animes fall into a pattern of bad thing happens, heroine pops up to solve bad thing, yay happy ending until the next episode. Princess Tutu starts this way--but then it breaks the pattern, and the audience begins to realize, just as the heroine does, that perhaps not all is as it seems.

Here's the basic story: a man named Drosselmeyer began writing a story about a Prince and a Raven, but before he could finish the story, he died--but the characters in the story became sick of not having an ending, so they leapt out of the story and into the town of Goldcrown. When this happens, Drosselmeyer's spirit awakes, and he realizes that, through the people of this town, he can continue his story. There is only one problem: he needs someone to play the role of Princess Tutu, the heroine who saves the Prince. He finds a duck, and he gives her a necklace to turn her into a girl and into Princess Tutu, the ballerina whose destiny it is to love the Prince but never confess that love, lest she turn into a speck of light and disappear.

It may sound strange, but it is a wonderful, deep story, going beyond just the surface of sadness, but into the darker realms of tragedy and despair--and then, in the end, emerging from both. It is a story of fairy tales, of loneliness and tragedy, of destiny and free will, of misconceptions, of doing what you believe is right, of learning you may be wrong, and above all, it is a story of hope.",1214870400,9,1892,4.415472779369628

The story is sweet and really gets interesting in the second half of the journey.  I particularly enjoyed the use of music and I found that I actually learned a lot about ballet in watching this.  The ending left me wanting more but I was happy anyway.

Definitely kid friendly, I think children who have any involvement in the arts would really enjoy and appreciate this - and the adults will be more than entertained in watching along with them.",1211846400,3,689,4.221374045801527

Now, it is up to clumsy Ahiru through the power of the elegant Princess Tutu to give these stories a happy ending. Each episode showcases a specific story and is highlighted by a classical piece of music.
This series has a depth that very few series can compete with. This is accomplished through the ""tragic hero"" and the correct exercise of classical pieces which add so much tension and drama to the setting. I would highly recommend this series to anyone and it has become one of my top favorites.

3177445,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Princess Tutu lives up to the hype! I kept hearing about how good this show or I should say Story is. It is one of the sweetest, heart pounding, touching but in a way simple Animes ever made!
It's so pretty and it's hard to  found words for it, Clean could be a good word?
Each esp is like a breath of fresh air away from the troubles of everyday life.
Princess Tutu's story and music and animation is relaxing, and IMO for 30 mins you're in Princess Tutu's world and most times I didn't want to leave.
I'm a BIG dub watcher and my goodness this Dub is wonderful! =) I've seen Princess Tutu's english VA in many shows and once again she proves that she is an amazing, sweet actress who seems to really love her charcthers.
Princess Tutu thank you for letting me enter your world! ^_^",1205884800,3,783,4.22

3177447,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Classical music, ballet, swords, knights, puppets, ducks, and an insane narrator that takes pleasure in destroying precious storyline.  What ISN'T there to like about this anime?

....Aside from its title.
Do NOT get turned off by the title!

Princess Tutu follows the story of FOUR characters: Rue, Mytho, Fakir, and Ahiru (called ""Duck"" in the anime, the translators didn't bother beating around the bush with translating her name).

The dark tones and bittersweet victories make this anime about 400 times better than anything Disney has ever come up with.  The chemistry between characters is almost palatable, and by the end of the series, you will be rejoicing at its ending... yet in your heart desiring more.  (For those who know the jargon, its like ending a musical piece on a IV chord.  It leaves you craving a total resolution, yet satiates you with its hints of a tonic note.)

And the MUSIC!  I truly loved the selection of authentic classical music that served as the backdrop to this anime.  For those with a finer ear, you will notice times that the creators purpousfully cut a melody at the V chord, and let it hover in the air, as the scene transforms to a darker tone.  It is masterfully done, especially since these songs are often recognizable by both the professional and amateur musician.  For those that have no experience in music at all- you will STILL recognize much of the music, and the stuff you don't- get your hands on a copy of it.

If you are okay witih a storyline that reveals its truths/history as it progresses, substantial characters, and a soundtrack compiled by the musical geniuses of the past era (and spliced together by musical geniuses of this century,)
then get the anime, and be captivated by its spell.",1202860800,19,1752,4.780730897009967
3177448,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"This DVD is amazing. It's really one of the best animes I've ever seen. It seems simple and shallow and girly, looking at the name and description, but when you actually watch it, it's very deep and it has an amazing story. It's worth the money and something everyone should see.",1202515200,3,279,4.490196078431373
3177449,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"When I ordered Princess Tutu, I expected something along the lines of Cardcaptor Sakura + Ballerinas. I was quite taken aback though, by the complexity (and sometimes general weirdness) of the story,  and the interesting characters. I guarentee the ending is not at all what you would expect from a ""magical girl"" anime. Princess Tutu captured my heart from episode one. I hope you enjoy it as well.",1202515200,3,399,4.867647058823529

3177451,5,B000VKJ6Z4,"Princess Tutu is dreamlike show: elegant, wonderfully designed, filled with beautiful pieces of classical music and twisted storyline. There is a lot to recognize in fairy tales which are told by the show, yet a lot to discover anew within very well-known stories. A mysterious princess Tutu from an old tale who looks like your ordinary clumsy girl... who is actually a simple duck! She fights to get pieces of the prince's heart back together, but according to the tale has no hope for his love in return. Does Sleeping Beauty wants to be awaken? Is there a suffering heart behind a black witch mask? Who will come to Cinderella by the end of the day? It is not that simple as 'princess loves prince and they live happily ever after'. Yet it is about love expressed in ballet language.

DVD Collection contains 6 discs with the original context. Unlike most of the ADV packs here you will find all the extras such as staff commentary, ballet terms dictionary, short but neat descriptions of music pieces, etc. Besides as a bonus you will find here a disc with preview of the new ADV project ""Five Centimeters Per Second"". The only disappoinment is that the DVD design is not the original one (with wonderful bright shots of all the main characters). All discs are the same, without images of characters and follow the colors of the case's cover which consists mostly of dark brown background and white-pink and blue type with only volume numering different from disc to disc.
Aside of that, considering the fact that singles are almost non-available and the price of the collection is good this is a great 'must have' item.",1200873600,6,1625,4.721830985915493
3177452,4,B000VKJ6Z4,"This anime series is one of the best I've seen  - out of 26 episodes, only two could be called filler, and the rest followed a clear plot arc (two really, they can be taken together or separately) with excellent character development and tight storytelling.  The background music, mostly Romantic with an emphasis on Tchaikovsky's ballets, fits wonderfully with each scene, the voice acting is great (Duck's voice can be shrill but it fits her) and the subtitling is accurate and non-intrusive. I haven't watched the dub yet.

The story basis is a classic one of the humble duck who falls in love with a human prince, but this series goes beyond that - I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil anything.  I'll give a hint and say it becomes a story about stories.

I didn't give it 5 stars because the packaging is bare-bones (no booklet at all), but there are lots of extras on the DVDs such as commentary and the original commercials for the series.

Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone who likes a good story and doesn't mind (or prefers) animated series. Older kids would enjoy it as well, but it can be dark, so young children might be scared by some parts.",1200614400,7,1175,4.545023696682464

All of the same special features, everything played smoothly.
The entire set, as always, A+.

This series really deserves lots of love and attention.
The best way to describe it is that it's unexpected. It starts out as a typical, cute fantasy tale and morphs. The use of ballet and the music are both wonderful and interesting, the characters are complex, and while some of the mini stories at the beginning of each episode are slightly creepy, the show is perfectly acceptable for young children. There is almost no violence, or at least not the bloody sort. There is plenty of danger though, as the characters are sometimes threatened with what you might call ""fates worse than death."" But overall it is a charmingly uplifting and cheerful series and that's hard to come by now.",1496102400,,930,4.541666666666667
