3445848,3,B001A7GOD4,"While I found this DVD intresting, it has been edited for the dvd release. The controversial pictures of Diana in the car has been blurredand are not shown at all. Just a warning",1228176000,10,178,4.424242424242424
3445849,2,B001A7GOD4,"I was disappointed in this movie. It just wasn't what I was thinking it would be about.
Not really sure what I expected, but I was left, at the end, thinking....""Well, what was that?"" I wish I had rented it instead of buying......",1224374400,4,230,4.372093023255814
3445850,5,B001A7GOD4,"Im glad I got this DVD-It gives an general idea on what might have or did happen on that horrible night of her accident! It did shed some light on how the driver was drunk and his blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit allowed to drive and the tabloids refusing to back off! Honestly, my guess it was a combination of these two that caused her death because I feel if Diana knew the driver was too drunk to drive, she would not got into the limo! I highly recommend this DVD and also highly recommend to buy Diana: The Last Days Of The Princess to go along with it!",1222646400,7,578,4.123893805309734
8276266,4,B001A7GOD4,"With interviews and reenactments this provides a time line of the 1997 Paris car crash as photogs chased the car which raced into the tunnel and crashed. A doctor happens upon the scene and aspires to help until EMTs arrive and try to stabilize her (before taking her to the hospital?)

The Police (not the singing group) round up some photogs and take them to jail for a body cavity check! Available photos are highly prized until it is announced she is dead, then they are worthless/unprintable. Insightful. Claims that the photogs are responsible, but the purchasers of magazines where photos appear do not want any responsibility. Insightful.",1504569600,,646,4.981481481481482
8276267,5,B001A7GOD4,The video came in great condition and played with no skips or stops or anything....,1446595200,,83,4.6
8276268,5,B001A7GOD4,"Interesting DVD.

Sad, however, that Diana was killed.  Imagine her life today -- meeting 'Kate,' Prince George and her second grandchild on the way.",1414540800,,149,5.166666666666667

8276271,4,B001A7GOD4,It was a very interesting show.,1405641600,,31,4.333333333333333
8276272,5,B001A7GOD4,"I mostly love any movie about Diana, Princess of Wales.  There are many theories as to why she died that night in the Paris tunnel.  I can't help but get a little sad to know that she is no longer with us.",1393632000,,205,3.857142857142857
8276273,3,B001A7GOD4,It was interesting but it did not go into the depth that I had hoped for. It left a lot of unanswered questions.,1379721600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8276274,3,B001A7GOD4,"This is a video of the arrested photograhers that French Police took in.  All film was destroyed, there were interviews with the photographers, but they are obviously holding SOMETHING back.  That disturbs me, for I suspect they're keepin' lips zipped to live and for the sake of loved ones.  Allegedly, the C.I.A., French Espionage experts, and the SES or whichever British secret dirty-work guys get called.
You'll have to conclude.....but yes, I do not believe it was accidental.  You should see the ring he had made for his proposal.  The British could be stuck with a  Monarch whose Father-in-Law is a Muslim - the ""upper crust"" and even ""UPPERS"" (big players in the plots and schemes circle).  Well, for them, it would be a 'difficult' situation if all this Muslim-slamming/fearmongerinng continues.  I say; Charlie, just let the kid have it once he's enjoyed a few children of his own and go enjoy your Camilla.  She be cool. :)",1369872000,,935,4.867088607594937
8276275,1,B001A7GOD4,"Don't expect much, if you order this video.  It is more about the people selling pictures of Diana then it is about the title of the video.",1356393600,,139,4.148148148148148
