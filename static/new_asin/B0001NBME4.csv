I am grateful that I can buy it because my children and I were extras in the film, and I want to buy it to see if I can see us.  I don't know if it is in the first one or the sequel, but there is a scene that is filmed near the Chemung River, and there are people watching from the Walnut Street bridge.  My children and I were asked to look down and point at what was going on.",1468972800,,436,3.617021276595745
8015023,5,B0001NBME4,"Not a super star movie, but, I was delighted to purchase this movie since it was filmed by a local director and includes many local people as actors. Loved seeing local Elmira spots, and the movie was really cute....styled after the ""Goonies"".",1390348800,,243,4.809523809523809
8015024,3,B0001NBME4,"defiantly old style 3D conversion.
story is ok might be good for some kids but not all.
the 3D in this requires an active 3D tv, passive 3D will not do you much good (although some of this might look some what ok on a passive 3D tv).
also some might not be able to play the 3D in this cause not all 3D tv's have a wide compatibility of older style 3D. if you tv supports field sequential 3D it will work.
as long as your bluray player supports 3D dvd's...might have to convert to sbs to get it to work)",1326585600,,502,3.9313725490196076
8015025,5,B0001NBME4,"This movie was filmed in my hometown of Elmira, New York, and my sister and I are actually two of the Street Corner Kids! I'm the little girl that wears the glasses and has the long straight hair, and my sister is the other little girl with the long wavy hair. (Mind you, this movie was made 14 years ago!) Like I said, I'm not being biased, but it's a fantastic family film! Now that I have two children, I love to let them watch it, and my daughter thinks it's cool that Mommy's in it! :)))",1127088000,,492,4.082474226804123
