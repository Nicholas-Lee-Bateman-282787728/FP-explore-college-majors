1057392,3,6305661677,"I was disappointed by how short the DVD was.
It is a good guide to use when meditating and I do use it sometimes.
I think it would be good for a true beginner which isn't me, but that's my fault for not reading all the copy!",1357430400,,224,3.7872340425531914

Each session is short, but if you are disciplined enough to put a few together you can have a great workout both physically and spiritually. The instructors are very easy to follow and the back ground is so pleasing to look at you almost forget you're in your own home!",1353196800,,325,4.433333333333334

1057395,4,6305661677,"This Yoga Zone Meditation video is lead by the founder of Yoga Zone, Alan Finger, and features one of his master instructors, Lisa Bennett.  It offers two basic meditation sessions, each approximately 30 minutes in length.  Both sessions contain pre-meditation postures, breathing exercises, seated meditation, and a final focus on the energy created within the body.

Session 1 is 33 minutes long.  The pre-meditation yoga postures are performed entirely on the floor and consist of simple forward bends and twists such as potted palm, cat/seal, simple seated twist, and one-legged seated forward bend.  Next comes an 18-minute segment which includes instruction and practice of alternate nostril breathing (4 minutes), kriya breath (4 minutes), focusing the mind with a mantra, and finally, 5 minutes of silent seated meditation.  The session closes with a focus on spreading the energy created by the meditation throughout the body.

Session 2 is called a Chakra Meditation, and it's a bit shorter at 27 minutes.  Again, it begns with seated pre-meditation postures, including dandasana, Sage 3 twist, and one-legged lotus forward bend.  Then, seated in a single lotus (or half-lotus) position, there is a 10-minute segment, the beginning portion of which concentrates on feeling the breath move in and out of the ribs.  The meditation portion which follows involves moving from chakra to chakra while meditating on a specific shape and color at each location.  During the final segment of this session, there are several minutes of silent seated meditation, and then Alan again finishes with spreading the energy created by the meditation throughout the body.

For those who are looking to try meditation but need some guidance, these practices provide a nice introduction, offering a combination of gentle prepatory yoga postures, breathing techniques, and both guided and silent meditation.",1231804800,4,1896,5.41156462585034
1057396,5,6305661677,"When I first put this DVD on, I was a little bit of a snob. I thought it was  going to be silly, but it ended up being the best meditation DVD that I own! The quality wasn't as great as my other DVD's, but I loved the meditations. This instructor explains everything you're doing very well and his assistant shows the postures clearly.",1201478400,4,335,4.234375
1057397,1,6305661677,"When I bought this DVD I was under the understanding that it was for beginners, and I found that to start you have this model like lady who can fold her body in all kind of shapes and forms, who seemed so advanced that I just shut the whole thing off and I still have not finished to watch the whole video. If you are looking for something to help you start practicing YOGA this is not for beginners at all!",1174521600,8,407,4.037037037037037
1057398,5,6305661677,"In spite of the fact that I've been doing Yoga every day for the past 9 years, I still have a hard time sitting still(when it comes to monkey mind I'm ""King Kong"" :)). Yoga as a moving meditation seems more suited to my nature.

 That being said, I do want to get better at seated meditation and this program is an excellent way to begin. It's long enough to let you taste the practice without being so long that it's overwhelming.

 As always, Alan Finger does a masterful job of leading you through the practice. The first segment starts seated with some preliminary breath instruction. Then you move on to gentle Yoga stretches to prepare you for the longer seated meditation to follow. There are some Cat-Extended Seal stretches, Potted Palm series (seated forward bends and twists) and then a one leg forward bend, but rather than bending over the straight leg as you typically would in Janu-Sirsasana you bend more over the bent leg. This enhances the release in the hips.

 After the more active segment you are led through alternate nostril breathing which is supposed to balance your brain. That is followed by some Kriya breathing in which you visualize the energy moving from the bottom of the spine (while firming the perenium/mula bandha) and follow the energy upward on the in-breath imagining the sound ""Hum"", then following the energy down the spine on the out breath w/ the inner sound of ""Sah"".

 He also gives a mantra, ""Mang"" (pronounced ""Mahng""), which you can use silently to help you have a point of focus along with the instruction to place a bit of saliva on your third eye center to help you create a focus on that area.

 The second meditation is a chakra practice which starts with some gentle stretches to prepare you for sitting. Then Alan Finger guides you through the chakras from bottom to top using different images (which are related to specific colors) to focus on as you bring your attention to those areas.

 I can see that this is a practice that I will need to implement into my life frequently in order to learn to quite my mind as well as my body. I always enjoy Alan Finger as a teacher because he really emanates sincerity without ever being preachy or self righteous. He also has a joyous quality that comes across in every program of his that I have and I have quite a few at this point.

 If you want to learn more about Alan Finger (and other Western Yoga teachers) check out the excellent book ""Yogi Bare"" by Philip Self which contains interviews with many of the most notable Yoga teachers in the West (such as: Baron Baptiste, Rod Stryker (a student of Mani and Alan Finger), Bryan Kest, Donna Farhi, Gabriel Halpern, Richard Freeman, Lillias Folan, Rama Birch, Rodney Yee, Vyass Houston (Sanskrit Scholar), Patricia Walden, and many others)

1057399,5,6305661677,"I have been practicing yoga for the last several months on a daily basis.  Yoga Zone's DVDs are absolutely fantastic! This DVD is consistent with the quality that I have come to expect from Yoga Zone.  Each session consists of 15-20 minutes of yoga exercises followed by a 15-minute meditation.  FYI, this is not a How-to-Meditate DVD.  It is simply a very well produced meditation DVD that one can use daily. This DVD also has 6 Chapter stops which allows a great deal of flexibility.  For example, if you would like to begin the meditation without the yoga exercises you may do so.  The two meditations on this DVD are considerably different:
The content of each meditation is as follows:
First Meditation
*Alternate nostril breathing
*Breath-work involving movement from the root chakra to third eye through the use of a
  mantra
*3rd eye balancing
The Second Meditation
Chakra Balancing
Both meditations are highly effective.  I recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a way to meld his or her yogic practice with meditation.",1075075200,58,1030,4.907514450867052
1057400,5,6305661677,"I love this tape. Sometimes I have to motivate myself to pop it into the VCR and actually do it, but Alan Fingers calming voice is enough to get me started. He starts with postures that are supposed to align you and get all of your being into focus before you meditate. He introduces some very powerful tools to catch those stray thoughts and turn them into calming ones. He speaks softly, slowly, calmly, as though you had all the time in the world. When at last you do enter the calming phase of the meditation itself (and I was able to do this the very first time), it's so free, so far removed from work and kids and noise and hassle, that you don't want to leave. Alan Finger allows you to explore this realm for awhile, and then come back to yourself. I always feel fabulous afterwards, but i think I need to do it every day, because the fabulous feeling only lasts until the next crisis occurs! Put it this way; It cannot hurt, you can gather some very insightful thoughts into yourself, and if nothing else, you have had 30 minutes of quiet. I usually darken the room, light some incense, and enjoy.",1030060800,30,1107,4.352657004830918

7892699,5,6305661677,"I don't really have that much else to compare Yoga Zone to, but I've always liked them.  Used to use the VHS tapes.  Happy to be able to purchase them on DVD.  The instructions are good and clear.  I've found that in comparison to some of the other yoga discs I've tried, they instruct more clearly on the fine details of the poses and your breathing and that these details have made the experience better and more effective for me.  Those slight adjustments and proper breathing can make a huge difference.  This Meditation disc is just right.  I think the sessions are about 20 minutes.  They settle you in with some very gentle stretches.  It's a nice way to start or end the day.",1390262400,,683,4.443548387096774
