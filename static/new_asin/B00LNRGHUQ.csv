8666982,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"""Insects are incredible.."" and this DVD proves it!  Once again, Two Little Hands created a high-quality show set to quality music. My LO loves Treeschoolers and this episode is no exception.  As usual, they encourage kindness and curiosity, along with the educational portions, all of which are incorporated into really catchy songs.",1446854400,,333,5.384615384615385
8666983,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"TreeSchoolers are awesome! We've backed all of the TLH campaigns on Kickstarter. My 3 year old loves these shows. My 10 year old gets caught up in them too when he thinks we are too busy to notice. My three teenagers have even been caught humming the tunes. :) I can't say enough about how educational and inspirational these shows are. We have loved and used all of TLH's productions for years. Signing Time helped us communicate better with our babies and toddlers, not to mention, it helped me learn to communicate better with my deaf neighbors. TreeSchoolers continues the Signing Time standard of excellence and gives pre-schoolers a chance to be inspired and educated while being entertained (not to mention they give Mom a chance to get a little guilt-free free time!). That's a win for everyone!

P.S. Be warned... Rachel Coleman is the master of the earworm! You will not be able to get ""Insects are incredible"" out of your head after you hear it. But it's a really catchy tune, so who cares! And seeing my littlest sing the ""An insect has two antennae... song and do the dance was so much fun! It's worth all the earworms! :)",1430265600,,1135,4.618811881188119

8666985,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"We LOVE Rachel and the TreeSchoolers.  We started watching when our daughter was 3 years old. She is now 4 and still loving all of the the TreeSchooler DVD's. If you want your kids to be able to do the ABC's with insects you are in the right place!  Rachel is amazing and connects with the kids. Each of the animated characters are fun.  We are one of the original backers of this Kickstarter. For us, after the success of Baby Signing Time, Potty Time, and Signing Time, in our home, it was a no brainer to be a backer for Rachel and the TreeSchoolers! We are so thankful that Rachel and the gang decided that ""too educational for tv"" would not stop them from making a truly amazing show for kids who are ready to learn!",1430265600,,721,4.248175182481752
8666986,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"We are so impressed with TreeSchoolers!  It is educational and fun.  Our kids love to watch it and we don't feel guilty about screen time.  My 4.5 year old and 2 year old both love TreeSchoolers and know all the songs.  Our favorite is Insects are incredible... ""an insect has two antennae, an insect has 6 legs, an insect has a head..."" They are singing these fun songs and learning at the same time.",1430265600,,401,4.378378378378378
8666987,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"My almost 4 year old absolutely loves this episode of Rachel & The Treeschoolers. He has been very interested in all of the Treeschooler episodes, but if he is the one picking one out it will be this one. We started with Two Little Hands Baby Signing Time series when he was 10 months old and have been completely amazed at how well he has picked it up and all the new things he's learned. I would recommend any of these dvd's to parents. They are easy to watch even after the umpteenth time hearing/watching them.",1430265600,,514,4.364583333333333
8666988,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"As new parents we decided that we wanted to teach our daughter sign language from an early age.  That is how we found Two Little Hands production and their Baby Signing Time products.  As our daughter grew and developed we moved into their regular Signing Time products as well.  Since Two Little Hands Productions and Rachel have become a staple in our home, when I heard that they were launching a Kickstarter campaign for the Treeschoolers videos I was compelled to become one of their original backers even though my kids were too young for preschool videos.  My kids are now 16 months and 3 years old but the Treeschoolers videos are a favorite for both of them.  My 3 year old has learned how plants grow, how thunder and lightning are created, and the features that make an insect different from other animals.  These videos are not only very educational, but they make learning fun.  The characters are loveable, the songs are fun and will leave you and your kid singing them for days after you watched the video, and the content is presented in a way that helps kids learn the subject.  Being a proponent of teaching sign language to our kids, I have also been pleased that there is some sign language mixed into the lessons as well.
We have been backers for all of the Treeschooler campaigns and my kids both get excited when a new DVD shows up.  My three year old regularly bursts into songs from the show and my 16 month old gets excited when the videos come on and she claps her hands and dances around and signs more or again when the videos end.
You won't be disappointed with these videos content and your kids are sure to love them for years to come!  These are a valuable addition to your video library!",1430265600,,1721,4.487179487179487
8666989,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"The theme at my son's preschool last week was Insects and so we prepared by watching this more that 3x that weekend. He absolutely loved it! He's 3.5yo and has only been in school for less than 2 mos. so he's still dealing with a little separation anxiety. But last week, he actually looked forward to school, excited about all that he's learned and per Rachel's instructions,  share with his friends. He was so excited to show that he remembered how to sign ""bug"". 
This DVD is packed with information and fun stuff that helped another ""treeschooler"" be ready for school. We love it!",1430265600,,584,4.605769230769231
8666990,5,B00LNRGHUQ,"My three year old and 18 month old cannot get enough of Rachel and the Treeschoolers! I love it too and am constantly singing the songs, they are so catchy! Rachel Coleman and her team are brilliant in the way they have written and produced these shows. Not only do they feature fun characters, super cute kids, songs and american sign language, your child will actually LEARN something from watching - and you will too! I backed this project on Kickstarter and I am SO glad I did. Parents, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. You and your kids will be so happy you did!",1430265600,,572,4.355140186915888
