While the majority of the videos are awfull this particular one is AWESOME. Where these ladies suck at teaching dance based videos they excel at strength training and toning. The moves are easy to follow, and while some seem easy, you do feel the burn. What I love about thier toning videos are that it is geared to all fitness levels. The instructor is in front demonstrating each move for the intermediate level. She has a woman in the back doing an easier more moderate version for us out of shape beginers and another woman in the back doing a more challenging version for the more advanced exerciser. She does a good warm-up and cool down.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that while there was a ton of booty work, I felt there wasn't enough ab work. But I still recomend buying this.

Just one suggestion: if you do buy it, purchase it through Amazon and not Flirty Girls website. Otherwise you will be sent (and charged for) a bunch of videos that you won't want.",1362960000,4,1156,4.347222222222222
8492332,5,B00641PMSO,"While the whole workout isn't tough, some of what you do really burns! I can really feel my muscles working out. You do your abs, booty and thighs. There's a section where you do your inner and outer thighs and it really burns! I'm sort of used to the ab workouts, so they don't bother me as much, but the booty and thigh workouts can get tough. I know this workout is going to be good for me. I would recommend this video for any woman that wants to work out their abs, booty or thighs. You even kinda get a workout for your arms because you have to hold yourself up with one arm, so this dvd workouts out all the areas I want to work out!",1336608000,3,640,4.0078125
