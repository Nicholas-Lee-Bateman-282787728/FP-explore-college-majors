8409065,4,B003YE221Y,"In 1998, I got a box of Beta tapes from someone. While going thru the tapes, (Most of whish weren't marked) I stumbled upon this show. I watched it out of curiosity and because I like low budget shows like this. Low budget shows may not have the production budget as others but they usually have heart and can be quite entertaining. Looking at it in this sense, this show is great. For almost 2 decades, I only watched the first episode so I know that one by heart. There was a lot of thought given to this show. The parodies are either spot on or near target. And the writers knew when to make a sketch long (Handy Dan, Bachelor Pad, Bikini Beat) and when to keep them short (Gomer Heil N.A.Z.I., The Mother) The biggest difference from this DVD to the broadcast copy I have is the sketch Lifestyles of the Poor and Unknown. The broadcast copy is a short 1 or 2 minute sketch with a woman narrating. This version is a full 5 minute sketch with a Robin Leach impersonator narrating. Pretty interesting and I wonder why they changed it. I liked The Son of Channel K but not as much as the first one. There was some interesting sketches. Nut the love and care that was in the first ep seemed gone. It looked more like a collection of sketches that a cable channel lineup. But it was entertaining nonetheless.

  I only gave this 4 stars because of the weakness of Son of and Bachelor Pad. But it's still a good buy. And if you like these types of shows, then you should buy it.",1471737600,,1475,4.260714285714286

8409067,5,B003YE221Y,"Finally!  I was a trans-coastal teen, growing up in both New York and Los Angeles.  When in L.A., in the 1980s, I remember this show playing on a movie channel we had called ON TV. This was long before we had HBO and Showtime in Los Angeles.  The only other one in our area was Z Channel, which showed art house films.  Channel K was the anti-Z Channel.

It was so politically incorrect.  One recurring segment was about Siamese twin cops who were like the Odd Couple - but worse, because they were joined at the hip.  The neat one was lonely and always trying to have romantic candle-lit dinners with women, but his brother - the sloppy one - was always sitting at his side, usually belching!  And then there was Chad, the ""Bachelor Pad"" guy, who I would have sworn was for real.  I don't know who came first, Chad or the Wild and Crazy Guys (Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd) on Saturday Night Live, but you could believe this jerk really existed.  My dad had me watch ""Bachelor Pad"" as a warning, to see the kind of men I should never EVER date!

The production value here is better than Saturday Night Live from the same period, because many of the skits were shot outdoors.  Probably more on par with SCTV, but faster-paced.  Other than some of the true classic SNL and SCTV skits, Channel K strikes me as funnier.  The regular players here, each handling several recurring characters, are every bit as talented (and funny) as the original classic lineup of SNL.  As far as I know, fame and fortune never came their way like it did for many of the SNL'ers and SCTV'ers, but it's certainly not because they didn't have talent.  I think it was because Channel K was run on a premium movie channel instead of NBC, like the other two shows were, so it didn't reach a big enough audience.  It was a cult thing.  But a very funny cult thing.  I hope it becomes a cult thing again, and they put out more of these guilty pleasure gems!",1281571200,,1928,4.350140056022409
8409068,4,B003YE221Y,"There's a nostalgia bug that bites me every now and then, and this production really can satisfy the yen for poofy hair and garage/guerrilla/cable comedy.  The technical integrity may be stone age by the standards of even 10 years ago, but where else will you see Siamese twin cops, joined at the hip, chasing criminals and double dating with a pretty girl they pulled over for having ""a tail light that flickered once about a mile back""?  Or segments like ""Life Styles of the Poor and Unknown"" where their version of Robin Leach goes into the ghettos to show us ""rich cable TV subscribers"" how ""the other half"" live.  It may be cruel, but it's also a cruel fun (especially if you remember that really awful show we had on TV back then called ""Life Styles of the Rich and Famous."")!  And did we ever look like that guy who hosts ""Bachelor Pad"" to the women we chased?  I fear -- and secretly hope -- we may have.  I can't give this five stars, and probably shouldn't give it four, because of the spotty production value, but I laughed when I saw it way back when, and I'm laughing now.  What else matters?",1281484800,,1105,4.413793103448276
8409069,4,B003YE221Y,"I was a fan of Chad Randolph when I was a young man too many years ago, and am happy to see he is well represented on this DVD.  Chad always did a segment in each Channel K show, but also had a series of his own called ""Bachelor Pad.""  You get four different segments with him here.  Do they hold up?  Well ... I'll just say, Chad taught me everything I know today about women - and how to get along with them.  That's probably why I've been divorced three times.  The divorces were awful, but Chad Randolph still makes me laugh.",1281052800,,529,4.087378640776699
