1220240,3,B00000IBY4,"This film is okay. The opening sequence and the parts in the funhouse where Jackie fought in the mascot and the part where danger pops up every second. Comedywise, sammo hung suffers in this film largely due to richard ngs character and the character of teabag. Some other reviewers have claimed that this film is short on fight scenes but that is not true. When you consider the story being told, there is really too much action. This film is like alot of 80s hk action films. They substitute much style and creativity for mindless brutuality. The main flaw with the film is lack of depth. Why should we care about these characters and the adventures they go on? Flashy action and comedic hijinks try to fill this void but is not enough. The film is decent enough but can't be great because their is zero connection between the audience and characters to warrant such titles as great movies",1466812800,2,891,4.610062893081761

Amagon is sending me out a replacement dvd, hope this one is better.

Jackie Chan in this movie only has a small part.  Sammo Hung is more prominent.  There are a couple of stupid pranks but if you get thru them this wasn't a bad picture.  It is a comedy and you do get a few laughs.  The good guys win and the bad guys don't.  Just like it should be.",1338768000,,639,3.7518796992481205

1220290,4,B00000IBY4,"Some films seem destined to have sequels. This is especially true if you have a multitude of popular stars that do not have to contribute to the whole film (and if one does not work out replace him), a boilerplate formula and financial success on the first movie. In fact, My Lucky Stars (1985) was more of a hit in HK than its predecessor Winners and Sinners (1983) with the original raking in 22M HK dollars and the sequel 30.7M HK. While I have grown in appreciation of the first film, I have also grown a little less interested in the first sequel though a few segments transcend above the mostly mediocre material. When watching this film it is good to think of this as an ensemble piece not a Jackie Chan or a Sammo Hung film (though Sammo did direct this in his most prolific period and after the success of The Own and Dumbo (1984)). That frame of mind might help in enjoying this uneven picture more.

In the beautiful locale of Japan, Muscles (Jackie Chan) is chasing a corrupt Hong Kong cop (Lam Ching Ying: Mr Vampire) though an amusement park with the help of Ricky (Yuen Biao: Prodigal Son in an extended cameo compared to Winners and Sinners) until Ricky gets whisked away by a band of ninjas. This nice little 11 minute sequence of Jackie works well with the fight choreography and shows some nice jump stunts by Jackie. I am not sure of Sammo's use of slow motion in the beginning though. It just seems timed poorly (I have sensed this problem in a few of his movies like Mr. Nice Guy). There is also a strange scene where Muscles gets stopped by tourists to take a picture. If you were chasing a crook would you let yourself be stopped by tourists?

Jackie needs help to find his partner. The help will have to come in the form of five trusted crooks since the cops could be spotted by the former HK officer. The ringleader is Sammo (once again having a horrific haircut) and he (after a stint in jail) has to recruit the old gang: Rawhide (Stanley Fung: The Owl And Dumbo), Sandy (Richard Ng: Shanghai Express), Herb (Charlie Chin) and Round Head (Eric Tsang who is in this movie instead of John Shum from the first film). They will be lead by a legitimate police officer Inspector Woo (Sibelle Hu playing basically the same foil role as Cherie Chung did in the first - I did say this was a boilerplate formulaic movie) who is consistently being hit on by the males (during a very tiring six minute gag) while having to take them to Japan.

The whole second act of the film and the majority of the movie are the comedic sequences of Sammo getting the gang together, meeting the female assistant and going to Japan. While some of it can be funny (Richard Ng is almost always hilarious and those damn curly haired bus drivers), some of it is just strange like the Eric Tsang sequence of playing ""fly"" poker and some jokes just fill like filler. And there is that Bolo Yeung Sze cameo.

When the third act starts with the appearance of Jackie Chan the pace of the movie goes from stagnant to ludicrous speed (interesting how the comedy segments were less fun than the action). Without giving too much away the haunted house fight segment with Jackie Chan going through the maze like corridors is quite good and the most talked about aspect of this film is the Japanese villainess played by female bodybuilder Nishiwaki Michiko in her first Hong Kong role (she did not speak Cantonese at the time) and her fight with Sibelle Hu. Her fight introduction (disrobes her kimono and then flexes) has also been mentioned in many male-written reviews. There are other fights with Lam Ching Ying and Lau Kar Wing that are quite good if a bit short. Also check out that nasty fall toward the end - breaking bodies for our entertainment.

Fans of action films will find something to like in this movie. While it is quite uneven there are worthy scenes (especially the end and beginning) to watch several times. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung fanatics will, of course, have to watch this, but on multiple viewings will probably only want to watch the first and third act. If you have not seen Winners and Sinners then see that film first. The comedy aspects did not work as well for me as the first movie and the characters seemed less in depth. Richard Ng was underused and that is enough to make me and anyone angry.

I have the uncut R1 Fortune Star/Fox release which has a good transfer but no extras except trailers. The big minuses are the dubtitles and no original mono. The dubtitles are quite atrocious because of the amount of narration (voice over) on the English dub causing a huge amount of phantom subtitles if you listen to the Cantonese track (no one speaks but the words are there) and at least one questionable in taste Japanese imitation. Also since a lot of the humor is verbal, a lot is lost in translation. Here is another example of a Hong Kong R1 release that does not match the Hong Kong Legends R2 release for extras including a Bey Logan commentary (unless you would prefer a scholar like Stephen Teo doing your commentary).",1233705600,2,5050,4.501635768811341

1220293,1,B00000IBY4,"Im a spoiled fan of Chan in Western flicks, and was expecting more of the same. Wrong. The characters and plot were sophomoric and mostly a clumsy attempt at Three-Stooges type comedy. Example - when not in their black ""uniform,"" the scowling bad Ninjas appear in 50's style zoot-suits and broad-brimmed hats (except the sexy female baddie). The two main fight scenes (very early, and at the end) totaled about 10-15"" and were classic Chan.

Most of this movie is about nothing but jokes about grooping and rapeing women.  I don't want to say too much about this movie becuase I want you to watch it but first one must watch winners and sinners.  Kang Jack sang is only in the first 3 movies a little sammo comes in and out from time to time after the first three but it is a stupid movie and if you don't like those don't watch the movie but I love sammo hung he is a great actor and writer he just never got as huge as Kang Jack Sang(Jakie Chan) Becuase he likes to share the spot light and isn't as selfcentered as Kang Jack Sang.

Richard eing funny funny  man

Yuen Baio great stunt guy and actor I think never got famious but needs a hand used to do a lot of Kang Jack sang's (JACKIE CHAN'S) stunts ALL THE TIME but never got the credit.

1220357,4,B00000IBY4,"This was the first subtitled Jackie Chan (sorta) movie I ever got, and I will have to say that it was quite possibly the worst choice for the first in the world.  When I read on the back that Jackie was in Japan, I thought that it was written by some idiot who thinks that Jackie Chan is Japanese; but when he called his superior in Hong Kong, and the phone had a Japanese flag, I got REALLY confused!  There's also a scene in which the Lucky Stars (the five main characters) get in a sticky situation, and must be recognized by a gang as being good people by speaking with the same Cantonese accent.
I sadly couldn't reach the ending the first couple of times I sat to watch it.  However, after a month or so, I finally caught on, and discovered that once you get into the right state of mind (and after those two parts), it's quite easy to enjoy!  Following it accurately no longer mattered to me!
Why?  It's because I discovered the secret: this movie is all about the characters and the situations of the present scenes!  Even the complete absense of Jackie Chan through 65% of this movie no longer mattered; the Lucky Stars were all very real, and VERY likable!  The sequences with them lusting over Ba Wah are all very amusing, and the fight scenes (which DOES NOT include Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez) in the end are all great!
My Lucky Stars is enjoyable fun from beggining to end.  Once you get through the strangeness of the movie, it could dominate your next week's worth of nights by making you watch it over and over again!  Have fun, and enjoy!",1001030400,6,1554,4.368055555555555

Jackie Chan is included(and has one of the best fight scenes  of his career)but is very limited.  This is a fun stylish(very  stylish)martial arts comedy.  Starts off with an explosively funny and  exciting car chase and a small fight.(ninjas in blue? Of course)This sets  the plot in motion and the next hour is mostly comedy scetches that  introduce the five lucky stars.  The humor is very strange but very  amusing.(also very juvinile,if that,but still very funny)  It's interesting  to see humor from other countries.  A very different sense of humor than  the US, but i like it.  It is, however,an aquired taste(consider this your  warning)  The final fight scene(s) are among the most fun and original That  I have ever seen, so even if you don't like the humor, the climax is alone  worth it!  Sammo is a fantastic director and if you like his style of  directing, I highly reccomend it.  I have seen all the movies featuring  Jackie Chan as well.  This is in the top 3 that i have seen.  (the others  being police story and rumble in the bronx)  i also reccomend getting the  dvd.  the video is poorly dubbed and scenes are chopped up.  the subtitles  on the dvd is fantastic and the widescreen is great in a 1.85 aspect ratio.",966556800,11,1400,4.534412955465587

It's actually pretty slap-stick.  The plot is simultaneously super-generic while also barely existing.  There's a solid 50 minutes in the middle of the movie where Jackie Chan doesn't even appear.  However, on the plus side, the last 25 minutes of the movie includes some pretty cool fight scenes.  It might be worth just seeing the last 25 minutes of the movie for the fighting.  You won't really be missing any important plot or character development, so you might as well.",1522108800,,626,4.785046728971962

7909841,5,B00000IBY4,"At the beginning it was a little disappointing to see the action sequences have so many cuts, with none of the elaborate choreography that makes Jackie Chan's films so great. But the mix of action and comedy plus the endearingly goofy cast made this an absolute blast throughout.",1492819200,,279,4.833333333333333
7909842,4,B00000IBY4,"In or around 1988, this was one of the first films with Jackie Chan that I ever saw. Loved it then and later, in the early 90s, I bought a VHS copy with the original English dubbing. This more recent dubbing is less fun, and less funny, than the original version.
However, it is still one of my fave Sammo Hung/Jackie Chan/Yuen Baio collaborations.",1486771200,,348,4.453125
