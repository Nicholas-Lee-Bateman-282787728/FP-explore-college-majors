BECAUSE OF THIS THE CHILD IS TAKEN FROM HIM.  AND THE TRUE STORY OF HIS FIGHT TO GET HER BACK BEGINS",1325376000,3,233,4.2727272727272725
2245975,5,B0007VY53K,This movie makes me cry everytime I watch it because it is a true story.  I love Andrew McCarthy and Teri Polo.  They also starred together in another lifetime movie called Straight from the heart.... great chemistry.  I love ordering dvd's from Amazon.  I always get them in perfect condition and very quickly.,1251244800,10,311,4.811320754716981
2245976,5,B0007VY53K,I love this movie. I think it is moving and all of the actors did fine jobs.  Teri Polo was very moving as Kim.  And I think that Andrew McCarthy did a great job. I think he is one of the most underrated actors in the business. He always does a good job no matter what the character.,1247184000,6,283,3.8620689655172415
2245977,4,B0007VY53K,"When I saw this movie a few years ago it was called A Father For Brittany, since I'm a fan of made for tv movies I watched and I was crying right from the start I thought it was about time that they make a movie where they show that men actually do like being fathers and that they fight just has hard if not harder for their children as any woman. I love this love and can't wait to get the dvd.",1231286400,19,396,3.783132530120482
2245978,4,B0007VY53K,"This is a moving true story. I was not impressed with Andrew

McCarthy in the movie. I think they could have found a better actor. It was nice to see Michael Learned in the role as an employee of the adoptive agency. Since she will always be remembered as 'Olivia Walton'.It was nice to see her playing a different role and doing a nice job. This movie will have you crying both tears of sadness and joy. Highly Recommend it.",1155254400,21,425,4.3125
2245989,5,B0007VY53K,The movie and delivery was great. My problem with Amanzon is that I can not find movies that I want. I do not like seeing movies that you are wanting to sell.,1404950400,,158,3.96875
2245990,5,B0007VY53K,"It has a good story line I really enjoyed it.  I want to watch it again, right now my Grand daughter has it.  We are both Andrew McCarthy fans.",1401580800,,143,3.896551724137931
2245991,5,B0007VY53K,I liked the movie a lot. It just come to show what can happen in real life when adopting children from other countries.,1392854400,,119,4.217391304347826
2245992,5,B0007VY53K,Love this movie! I bought this movie for myself  instead of a gift for someone else. Glad I did! I would recommend it to anyone who likes true story movies.,1389139200,,156,4.2

2245997,3,B0007VY53K,"THIS WASN'T MY FAVORITE MOVIE.  KIND OF DREARY AT TIMES. ANDREW MCCARTHY DID OKAY BUT NOT REALLY UP TO WHAT I EXPECTED FROM HIM. I GUESS IT HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE SCRIPT THAN HIS ACTING. TERI POLO AND MICHAEL LEARNED SHOWED THEIR USUAL GOOD TALENTS. SEEING KEITH (MCCARTHY) CHANGE FROM AN ALMOST CHILDISH, FLIGHTY PERSON TO A CARING, LOVING FATHER WITH A
MISSION TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE MADE IT WORTH WATCHING. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT BUT NOT AS HIGHLY AS OTHER MCCARTHY FILMS. I'M SUCH A BIG FAN OF HIS AND LIKE TO
SEE HIS ROLES SHOW HIS GOOD TALENTS. I SUGGEST YOU GIVE IT A TRY.",1349049600,,604,4.252173913043478
2245998,4,B0007VY53K,"I enjoy movies that are based on a true story, which this movie is. My whole family enjoyed it very much. I like Andrew McCarthy in movies. He played in the movie ""The Christmas Tree"" which has never been produced on vhs or dvd yet. I wish whoever owns the rights to that movie would release it on dvd. I know it would be a big hit. I saw and recorded the movie when it was on tv many years ago.",1327708800,,395,3.888888888888889

8052419,5,B0007VY53K,Change of Heart is a real tear jerker.,1456099200,,38,3.875
8052420,3,B0007VY53K,okay.,1455408000,,5,5.0
8052421,5,B0007VY53K,"an excellent movie. I am biased tho, because I worked as a nurse's aide taking care of the real Kim Lussier when she was in the hospital. She was a very sweet lady. When Keith went public about the adoption agency taking the baby away from her, I was one of the ones supporting him by writing an editorial in our newspaper. I was very glad he was granted custody. He moved away from Buffalo NY (the movie changed the location) shortly after he was reunited with Brittany. It's going on 21 years now, I hope life has been good to them.",1454889600,,534,4.245098039215686

8052423,5,B0007VY53K,"yes this movie met all my expectations, I love movies that are right out of real life. I have had something in
normal life that can be helped with how these actors handle these things and know that things can be
worked out. I 'm just glad that these movies are available.

Thanks

8052425,5,B0007VY53K,"Very good movie.  I love anything Teri Polo is in.  She and Andrew were husband and wife and well, I don't want to give anything away but it was a really good movie and I would recommend it for anyone to see.  It was made in 2012 I believe and Teri looks really sharp in the movie.  It has some tear-jerking parts in it and that is what makes it even more realistic.",1420502400,,366,3.9726027397260273
