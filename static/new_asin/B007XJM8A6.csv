5114222,5,B007XJM8A6,"I was fortunate to see this film while it was on the festival circuit a couple years ago. That I still remember it vividly is a testament to it's quality.
Though bleak and somewhat disturbing, it's at the same time very beautiful. The story still haunts me all this time later. Style-wise, it's like watching paintings come to life and move.
Anyone with tastes leaning toward the macabre, and that tend to seek out films that shun the typical Hollywood happy gloss should do well to pick this one up.
The film may be depressing in subject matter, but you will be happy to have seen such a different take on the apocalyptic-future genre.",1335398400,6,636,4.587719298245614

5114226,1,B007XJM8A6,"I have to question, why was this made? Yes it is disturbing but not in any way that is redeemed by making us think. The disturbing nature of the film is the absolute soul reason it has any momentum at all. It is grotesque and so we cannot look away. In the end though it all feels very cheap, a movie that bludgeons us with morose nastiness because that's all it really is, morose nastiness. There is no take away, there is no elegant conclusion from which to draw deep and meaningful insights, which would be fine if this ponderous and pretentious production wasn't so sure of itself. Even at its short run time it is long and drawn out. The writing is plodding and wants us to believe it is deep in that less is more kind of way. There is nothing to read between the lines. This movie wants to be deep, but is really just ugly and emotionally stunted.",1468627200,,853,4.271604938271605

8522947,5,B007XJM8A6,"Animated and cgi. Pretty cool I thought, kind like watching Heavy Metal magazine. Give it 20 minutes, if you don't like it by then, you probably won't. Story is similar to Snowpiercer.",1501891200,,184,4.78125

8522954,2,B007XJM8A6,"I enjoyed the graphic novel Bergin originally created and while the art style isn't for most (dark, grotesque, hellscape imagery), found it worked really well and played to the strengths of the story.  Giving you a sense of weight and futility to the world he had created. It took the familiar tale of katabasis (hero's decent) and put a slight new spin on it.  With Cee, an expecting mother, lamenting the destroyed world she is travelling through and whether she wants to bring a new life into it.  Nothing major but made an enjoyable tale.

Unfortunately, the transition to film lost something in the jump.  The ""animation"" is minimal and seemed to just copy/paste the art straight from the comic, spare a few CGI scenes that are recycled throughout.  The story feels stretched out for a relatively short film (70min), dragging on with lackluster dialogue and repeated cuts to the apocalyptic landscapes.  Everything seemed to work against this movie and ended up creating a tiresome experience.  I didn't care about anything and wished for it all to end, so maybe that's what they were trying to accomplish - 'cuz I felt like I was in hell.",1470700800,,1144,4.801020408163265
