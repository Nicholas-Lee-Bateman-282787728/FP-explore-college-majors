8569648,2,B00BJEJMS2,I had the same issue as the other reviewer. I love this series and remember growing up watching it. But some episodes only play halfway through and then freeze and quit. I would say that he item itself might not be very good But thankfully the seller was very accommodating when I emailed about issues I had with my order. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I love the series and the seller was pleasant communicating and assisting me with my purchase.,1424476800,2,468,4.453488372093023
8569649,2,B00BJEJMS2,"While the show itself is fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone that asks me what my favorite series are, I'm disappointed with this copy. Maybe I'm just unlucky, but the last two or three episodes on each disc, depending on the disc, all but refuse to play. The episodes themselves freeze up and on the third disc it would just skip and glitch its way through the episode before just stopping altogether. I tried loading past the point where it begins and nothing works. Highly recommend the show, but I suggest getting a different edition than this one just in case.",1423612800,2,575,4.592233009708738
