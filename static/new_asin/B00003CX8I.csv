1261744,5,B00003CX8I,"WOW!  I really loved this movie!  I had been disappointed by other live-action and animated movies and shows in the past that portrayed other comic book heroes and failed miserably (except for Fox's X-Men cartoon which featured our favorite Cajun and other special guests).  However, this one definitely hits the mark, and I can't wait for the sequel.  I hope that the complete uncut version will make its way to DVD.
By the way, the opening of the movie left me speechless.  I could hardly breathe.  If I didn't believe I was going to have a wonderful 1.5 hours ahead of me, I was convinced by the end of the first sequence.",970444800,,625,4.535714285714286
1261745,5,B00003CX8I,"I was blown away by the movie as a whole.  The special effects were superb, the actors did a very good job portraying their characters, and the plot was great. This is one person who is getting this on tape right away!",970358400,,218,4.190476190476191
1261746,2,B00003CX8I,"Sorry, but I just thought the movie was a complete BORE!  The effects are the only thing going for this kiddie-flick.  Better luck next time, guys.",970272000,,147,4.615384615384615
1261747,3,B00003CX8I,"The movie is very good in some aspects, but lack in many.  The cast is perfect for their characters and play them well, and the graphics are pretty good.  But the storyline.  It sucks.  It's mostly about Wolverine.  Also, evolution isn't true, it never was and never will be, but what made the storyline worse was that they messed with the characters.  Cyclops is supposed to be kind in the comics, but his image in the movie is less appealing.  I recommend you get this movie, if only you like lots of graphics and like the cast.  But the movie is far from the comics in quality.",970272000,,580,4.355140186915888
1261748,5,B00003CX8I,"It's really an astonishing event when both sides of the comic-book spectrum (love them vs. hate them) can sit together in the dark and come out flushed with excitement over something magical, mature, and just plain entertaining.  Bryan Singer's movie is so enjoyable and -- natural -- that it's raised expectations for superhero movies for years to come.  Beautiful women, handsome men, noble heroes, and gnarly villains with depth and -- gasp! -- good dialogue fill the screen.  Full of humanity and pathos, X-Men delivers in a way superhero movies haven't delivered since Christopher Reeve flew around town on a wire.
While the movie delivers on its promises, it is -- inarguably -- too short, which just whets our appetites for a sequel (instead of causing us to dread one).  Production design, sound design, costumes, and, most of all, the spot-on, witty performances gel to form a whopping good time.  I highly recommend this movie.  It will soon be part of my DVD collection -- no question.",970185600,,996,4.934131736526946

1261905,2,B00003CX8I,"This is interesting, as I never read the X-Men. So I did not have any preconception or know if any of the charters are important or known.
The story is clear. You can tell the bad guys from the good. They do not try to mask anything and did an excellent job of telling the back-story. They picked the right actors for the parts and the actors did not over shadow the characters they played. You have to stretch your imagination a bit but it is worth it. The only drawback was the morals of you get what you ask for in spades.

Bottom line is it is worth watching once to say you saw it.",1502496000,,586,4.051724137931035

1261938,4,B00003CX8I,"The original X-Men film is usually fondly remembered, and for good reason. It's still entertaining and engaging for a lot of reasons, it's pacing, character development, and themes all still hold up well. Ironically, their need to replace the comic book costumes (which were too colorful at the time) dates this movie pretty badly. Matching leather outfits? It's obvious this film was from the early 2000's. Had they chosen to stick closer to the source material I think the movie wouldn't have aged so poorly visually.

I also wanted to add that the edition I received did not come with a Slip Cover (or O-Ring). The attached picture is the cover I received. Also, my HD digital copy code was good until April 2019. I'm not upset about my edition, but I was hoping for the Slip Cover to match my other X-Men movies. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase.",1501718400,,862,4.708609271523179

I guess I am too old for this sort of comic-book material, because it struck me as ultra-violent and ridiculous. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the production values were high, but the story was short on logic, and especially on science. Somehow, if this had been animated it would have been more credible, but having living bodies capable of these comic-book feats just seemed too incredible to take seriously.",1486684800,,563,4.584158415841584

1262216,5,B00003CX8I,"Hugh Jackman was so skinny and dorky looking in this movie. It makes me giggle. I've been a comic book nerd for over 20 years. Wolverine is supposed to be 5'2""-5'4"" and 220lbs without the adamantium.  But Jackman acts the part perfectly and these days he looks much more the part- although still far too lanky. I don't think they could have found a better actor for the part because I doubt the perfect body type would come with that acting talent.",1476057600,,448,4.463414634146342

1262249,5,B00003CX8I,"For some reason, a few people have rated these new copies of the XMEN movies with 1 star because they think that it supposedly says on the back cover that it's a two disc edition but when opened, it's only one disc. THIS IS FALSE. The new slipcovers and the case itself say bluray+digital. I read both the slipcover and the case artwork (even the fine print) and nowhere does it say it's two discs. Digital copies are exactly that. Digital, not physical. You do get two copies of the movie but not on two discs. First copy is a physical disc, second copy is a code to redeem the movie for free on VUDU.com. I'm not sure why this is so complicated for some to understand.

For the movie itself, five stars ALL THE WAY for the superhero movie that started it all!  I've loved this movie since I saw it in the movie theater and will continue to love it for the rest of my life!",1469491200,3,874,4.196428571428571

Be advised...this show has some redeeming value. Rejects evil. Rejects revenge. Undermined by some elements that promote self-determination in the absence of a moral perspective based on something greater than themselves.

Romantic and Humanistic with some redemptive elements without any acknowledgement of something outside of their plane of existence.",1469145600,,498,6.014084507042254

1262349,5,B00003CX8I,"This movie was the beginning of an incredible series, with numerous sequels and prequels.

The plot is good.  Magneto had created a device that would turn any regular human into a mutant.  He wanted to turn the World Leaders into Mutants, so the goals/needs of Mutants would be the same as the theirs.  Unfortunately the machine wasn't a success.  The induced mutation  was rejected, and the human body began to break down at the cellular level.  The X-Men had to battle Magneto's minions, to keep Magneto from using his machine.

Wolverine is a subplot to the main movie.  He's a primal/elemental character.  He's guided by instinct and has berserker fighting stile.  Primarily a loner personality, but fiercely protective of anyone he cares about.  This movie is when he first meets Rogue, Professor X, and the X-Men.  Though he never agrees with their political views, he eventually/reluctantly fights by their side.

The cast is spectacular.  Patrick Stewart is the ideal choice for Charles Xavier.  Ian McKellen portrayed Eric Lensherr flawlessly.  Hugh Jackman brought Wolverine to life - He is Wolverine.  Rebecca Romijn showed many aspects of Mystique.  Halle Berry showed both Storm's power and beauty.  Anna Paquin played Rogue, when she was just learning what it means to be a Mutant.",1458345600,,1295,5.076190476190476

1262363,3,B00003CX8I,"A pleasant balance of entertaining action and cheesiness. The story is an interesting, albeit silly one, and the acting varies. The Logan/Rogue subplot is the gold core of the film - the rest of it, including other cardboard characters like Cyclops and Storm were just silly filler.  I would have preferred that this film focused on the Logan story more and it starts to disappoint when we get to Xavier's school. Hugh Jackman owned this film, so its no wonder he's the core of every X-men film to follow.  The special effects are so-so for the time-frame: Magneto's mutating energy ripples look silly and computerized, and the sequence with the bullet stopping at the forehead, or the senator squeezing through the bars, just looked goofy.  The music is forgettable and by the end of the film the silliness of it all wears on you. Still, it's a fun bit of mindless escape.",1456617600,,873,4.730263157894737

1262528,4,B00003CX8I,"I know I saw X-Men when it was in the theaters back in 2000.  I also remember not being that impressed.  Of course, part of that was because it was so overhyped on some websites I visited I was sick of hearing about it by then.  Since my roommate's copy of the trilogy has been staring me in the face for months, I decided to rewatch this one.  The worst that happens is I get another review out of it, right?  To my pleasant surprise, I enjoyed the film despite some flaws.

The next level of human evolution is here.  Mutants with super powers have started appearing in the human population.  Us normal humans are not happy about it at all, and there is a bill before the Senate to require these mutants to register.  Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stuart) and Eric Lensherr (Ian McKellen) both oppose the legislation, although one of them is willing to go to bigger lengths to kill it.

Meanwhile, Logan (Hugh Jackman), a man with the ability to heal and some strange metal in his hand, is befriended by Marie (Anna Paquin), a teen who can absorb things via touch. Logan doesn't remember anything about his life until just a few years ago.  When the two are attacked, they wind up joining Professor Xavier.  But was their attack part of a bigger plot?

This is a weird mix of origin/set up and regular movie.  While Logan, aka Wolverine, doesn't remember much about how he became who he is, I did thanks to the prequel movie that I watched a couple years back.  Anyway, as Logan and Marie enter this new world, we get lots of explanations and introductions to the world of mutants.

On the other hand, most of the characters already know each other and are ready for the fight that is coming.  As such, it doesn't fall quite as much into the first superhero movie cliches that I am growing tired of seeing.  That in itself felt refreshing to me this time around.

Of course, there are several action sequences and lots of special effects.  I thought they blended well into the world the actors were inhabiting.  I believed what I saw, and I enjoyed the action.

The cast does an amazing job.  Rounding out things are the likes of James Marsden, Hallie Berry, and Rebecca Romijn.  There isn't a weak performance in the bunch.

However, there is a weakness to the film - the characters themselves.  I never feel like we really get to know any of them.  Yes, the cast is large, but even Logan and Marie, the real focus, don't seem as real to me as they should.  The movie was much more about action and story than characters.  Maybe if I knew the characters already from the comics, I would connect better.

Overall, I'm still glad I gave X-Men a second chance.  It's a decent superhero movie, and I'm looking forward to watching the sequel.",1433203200,,2744,4.471774193548387
1262548,5,B00003CX8I,"After watching all the X-Men movies so far (up to 2015), I must say overall this is by far the best X-Men movie. The characters were introduced well in the beginning, and the actors did a great job of portraying the comic book heroes that we have come to love. I thought the ending was good, with a bit more to be desired, but nevertheless, it set up the franchise well.",1433203200,,370,4.225352112676056

1262552,4,B00003CX8I,"A small percentage of the worlds population has natural mutations in their genetic code, each manifesting themselves differently. For many, it leads to special talents and abilities, but such capabilities come at a high cost: ostracization from society. Two factions have risen: one which believes that these mutants and the rest of humanity can live peacefully side-by-side, and another which believes a war is coming between mutant and humankind, one in which only one side will prevail.

Welcome to the world of the X-Men.

This flick is considered by many to be the beginning of the modern day superhero film era. Yes, we had Blade before this, but X-Men really cracked the door open in terms of taking a well-known comic property and bringing it to the big screen. Not only that, but there is some serious acting firepower in this movie, namely actors who don't do garbage, so right there that says something. Sir Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto, Anna Paquin as Rogueyeah, big deal stuff. Then you throw who was then an unknown into the role of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and you suddenly have a bunch of talented actors taking a serious stab at a story about mutants with superpowers.

Bryan Singer was known for The Usual Suspects before this flick, and with him at the helm, we got an X-flick that was serious, funny in the right parts, plausible and just plain cool.

They did right to take the most popular X-characterWolverineand tell the story primarily from his point-of-view. I mean, this role made Hugh Jackmans career and its a role hes gone back to six times, not including the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past due in 2014.

While the all-black leather costumes weren't really my thingI liked the more colorful ones from X-Men: First Class better, which were based off the classic comic book costumesthey brought a level of realism to the movie and prompted that joke later on when Wolverine complains about the uniforms and Cyclops says, Well, what would you prefer? Yellow spandex? At the same time, Im also in the major minority of people who think that properly-armored and modernly-stylized colorful superhero costumes could work in a real world situation. There are guys going around in The Real Life Superhero Movement dressed as such and are helping police after all.

Anyway . . .

The trick with an ensemble movie is to give each character enough history and density to make them likeable and relatable from frame one. When you have only a couple hours to do that, you need to have a story that revolves around each of them so they could each have their moment in the sun long enough to get the audience involved with them. X-Men does this for the most part and its no easy feat.

Of course, there is the metaphor of the evils of racism throughout the movie, and how all people are equal regardless of who they are, what they can do and what they look like. This theme is strangely overt yet subtle at the same time. Kind of depends what frame of mind you're in when watching it and your personal history and feelings on the topic.

This movie is an interesting, exciting, thoughtful and well-executed big screen adaptation of one of the biggest comic book franchises of all time. Did they nail it perfectly? No. Did they do a good job of taking the X-Men concept as a whole to the big screen? You betcha.

OR if you're seriously interested in special effects in movies, this certainly provides you with plenty to think about. However, I think I was born too late to be interested in the SE, so I have to decide on familiar grounds of narrative quality and thematic interest, and there the movie falls short. It's always nice to hear Stewart and McKellen speak their lines, no matter what the movie, but as far as the story is concerned, it just too flat thematically to be of interest to anyone over eight. One guy wants to dominate the world; another believes that we can all get along . . . but, of course, as long as the bad guy exists, then the good guy is going to need serious backup. Cue explosions, chases, and various gymnastics. I don't dismiss a serious interest in special effects video as in itself trivial, but it's not for me. That there's a market for this kind of movie is clear enough, so if it's to your taste, you won't be disappointed.",1422230400,,1052,4.372448979591836

This movie is a freebie to anyone who installs the Google Play app on their roku device.

I realized an aspect of Storm's power over the weather by seeing the visual of Sabretooth as giant blonde with beast eyes throttling ""the weather witch"" that for the roof to be torn open and for the sky to explode with lightning as if the universe above is in outrage over her violation as if a statement made about the human rights abuses inflicted upon African women - just as Kitty Pryde's phase power is exactly what a wisp of a girl needed in the concentration camps, what a dark elf like Kurt Wagner aka Night Crawler badly needed to be teleported off of Mengele's slab, what Blink badly needed to save herself and others in the Japanese-inflicted counterpart to the Holocaust in Europe.

So perhaps it's prophetic and most definitely apt that this X-Men's forgettable wrinkle is that Magneto uses radiation upon non-mutants to change them (probably poisoning them in the process) - normal - as in the banality of evil?

Still, there are some pacing issues (particularly in the final act), some fight choreography issues (once again, particularly in the final act), the mismanagement of Cyclops, and the first of many instances in which Professor X get knocked out of action because of his potentially plot-breaking power.

1262861,5,B00003CX8I,"Okay, I'm just going to say it:  that prison at the very end is awesome!  I'd sign up to be a superhero just for the chance to send someone to that prison!
  This film was widely regarded as being the revival of comic book movies, a genre that had lost many fans during the late 1990s.  It's easy to see why.  This film was smart, well-paced, and, while there were good guys and bad guys, nothing was black and white...at least in terms of motives.
  On the good team are the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier, who is played by Patrick Stewart.  Rather than simply fight for justice and to defeat evil, this team works to control their own powers and show mankind that mutants like them are not a threat.  It's nice to see heroes who, for the most part, do not have a tragic backstory.  It's explained that these heroes' various powers are due to a genetic mutation that people are randomly born with, like the genes that create hair and eye color.
  Playing for the bad guys is a team that was never really given a name.  They're led by Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto, who is played by Sir Ian McKellen.  This villain does have a tragic backstory, mainly that he is a Holocaust survivor whose parents were killed by the Nazis.  This helps influence his beliefs that humans and mutants can never co-exist and drives him to either eliminate the latter or turn them into the former...he's not that picky.  Actually, he and Professor X were once friends and he helped the professor build his school before their falling out.  While we've seen the plot of friends facing off before (i.e. pretty much every Spider-Man movie ever made), this is a little different.  For one thing, the falling out already happened long before this movie began.  And, despite their differences, these two still respect each other and don't want either to be hurt...it all falls into that gray area I sort-of mentioned before.
  Entering this conflict is drifter Logan, also known as Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman.  With animal-like senses, super-fast healing powers, and an adamantium skeleton he can't remember having implanted, he winds up at the X-Mansion, where he slowly gets to know the professor and his students and fellow faculty.  While he too isn't wild about Magneto's plans, he'd rather not get involved more than anything else...even though his new friend Rogue, played by Anna Paquin, has different ideas.  Of course, there is the fact that the X-Men did rescue Wolverine from the clutches of Magneto's henchmen.
  This was a great film, a great start for a film series that's still going strong fourteen years later, and a great revival for a thought-to-be-gone film genre.  I had never read the X-Men comics, but I've seen a couple of the TV shows that have been put out in the late 90s and early 2000s, so I'm not completely oblivious to these guys.  Consequently, I was a bit disappointed by James Marsden's performance as Scott Summers/Cyclops.  Cyclops had always been one of my favorite X-Men, but here, he was pretty bland, his only motivation being to keep his relationship with Jean Grey alive and well and consequently forming a rivalry with Wolverine...kind of boring for a guy who can shoot laser beams out of his eyes.  I found Magneto to be the most interesting and Ian McKellen did an unbelievable job in the role...he's not outright evil, but he has some ideas which, given his youth, aren't entirely unjustifiable.  I especially like when he reminds Xavier that, even if he were not a threat anymore, the problems both men have been combating were still alive and well.  Apart from being a wide-open door for sequels, this is just a great insight into the character's mindset.
  This is a film for both old and new fans of the X-Men.  Fans of superhero films will definitely enjoy it too.  So will fans of movies in general.  It's no waste of time for anyone.  Enjoy.",1405036800,,3892,4.6759941089838

1262896,3,B00003CX8I,"I highly enjoyed the movie, however, half off the entire film was setting up and explaining the backstory. I realize that this is completely necessary to begin the series, but for someone that previously knows the story, it can be very annoying how slow it takes off. Overall it was a good watch.",1401840000,,296,4.60377358490566
1262927,3,B00003CX8I,Great origin movie. Wolverine is awsome. Professor X is great.  Mystic is dangerously beautiful.  This was a great marvel movie.,1401753600,,128,5.35

1262933,5,B00003CX8I,Wonderful! What else is there to say? A really spectacularly reimagined reboot of an already spectacular world. Incredibly directed by the talented albeit misguided Bryan Singer.,1401235200,,178,5.884615384615385
1262934,3,B00003CX8I,"In the past the X-Men franchise was fun. My girlfriend had never seen any of the films, so chose the earliest that also sets the scene for those that followed. Hugh Grant does a good job of playing the irascible Wolverine. Otherwise, the actors are working to breathe life into two-dimensional characters. The special effects and action scenes are okay but rely too much on super-short takes that make them seem jerky. Like the styling of some old cars, it makes you wonder why you liked them at the time.",1401235200,,505,4.622222222222222

1262966,4,B00003CX8I,"Awesome first film of the series. It catapulted Hugh Jackman to stardom and he hasn't left the role since. It's been nearly 15 years since this movie came out. I saw this film I. Theaters at twice if not  three times and is based on one of my fav comics. Bryan Singer does a great job with x-men movies and I hope he keeps directing more if them. Days of Future Past is now the best one of all but this was the first and cannot be replaced. Great casting except a few, like storm, but whatever.",1401062400,,494,4.092783505154639

1262975,5,B00003CX8I,"This movie really legitimized Marvel's venture into converting comics into movies and really the ""Grand Daddy"" of them all trailblazing the path for all others to follow.

The X-Men comic series became the cornerstone of Marvel's success in the late 70's and 80's and ultimately their ""crown jewel"" as viewed today.  Brian Singer and Marvel took a huge risk retelling the Chris Claremont/John Byrne era ""Comic Hall of Fame"" stories, and clearly ""the high risk - high reward"" philosophy paid off.  They fully accomplished the ""believability"" goal of bringing the comic story/visual into the modern era.

If you are an X-Men Fan or just curious about the ""Mutant"" story - don't hesitate, this movie is a great ""Hero story"" (regardless of familiarity with the franchise) and for the Marvel/X-Men fan a triumphant, quality tribute to the series (and a great ride!)",1399766400,,860,5.078014184397163

1263019,4,B00003CX8I,"The second disc contains all the special features, and as far as I can tell, it's an exact copy of the special edition DVD's disc 2, only, for some reason, they placed the features on a Blu-ray. The quality is the same as the DVD version, so they probably should have just left the second disc as the original DVD version, as I don't think the Blu-ray disc added anything.

The movie was very good quality, although the added resolution does make some of the effects less believable, thankfully Bryan Singer likes to use as many practical effects as possible, so this is minimized. It was great watching the first X-men movie at such a high quality for the first time for me. I love this movie.",1397865600,2,694,4.464566929133858

1263022,5,B00003CX8I,"One of the best superhero movies of all time! The Avengers and newer X-Men movies are better only in the higher amounts of action. X-Men First Class is my personal pick for best superhero movie ever. Watch for X-Men Days of Future Past to be released in theaters this year. Look on YouTube for the previews. I did and the preview alone BLEW MY MIND! Effects and graphics like in Night Creature or Day Watch or even as good as The Matrix. Marvel Comics is matched only by DC in their overall company but the two are VERY close overall. If Marvel keeps releasing stuff like this for just another year, they will surpass even names like Batman or Superman EASILY. Excelsior!",1396915200,,671,4.508196721311475

I was a bit confused when I ordered this DVD because the ad says it's ""X-Men,"" but shows a picture of X-Men: First Class, so I wasn't sure which movie would actually be arriving.  It is indeed the original X-Men, which is what I was hoping it would be.  The ad details weren't very informative, so I'll tell you about the copy I received.  It's the single disc, anamorphic wide-screen (aspect ratio 2.35.1), English edition (5.1 surround sound), with subtitles in English and Spanish.  It comes in a hard cardboard case, rather than traditional plastic case--it's a nice one with artwork and a sleeve with the typical original X-Men cover art.  It features interviews with Bryan Singer, Hugh Jackman screen test, still gallery, Animatics, trailers and 10 minutes of extra footage.  It's essentially the same DVD (other than the case) as others offered, but it was much less expensive at the time I purchased it.

1263194,3,B00003CX8I,"The first X-Men movie is an entertaining film but an extremely basic film.  It is definitely not bad, but it is not great either.  I spoiled myself by watching X-Men United first.  After watching that brilliant film a number of times watching this film for the first time felt very underwhelming.  After watching in a number of times after that I came to enjoy the flick.  I also thank the film for helping to open the doors to a long chain of superhero films throughout the 2000s and still going strong.  If it was not for this film or the first Spiderman film, we might not have nearly as many superhero films as we have today let alone great ones.  However, it is still basic superhero film compared to films compared to later movies like X2.

Most of the cast does a good job.  I like most of the characters.  The majority of the actors fit their characters perfectly especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart (Professor X).  Famke Janssen does a good Jean Grey and James Marsden does a really good Cyclops.  One thing that this movie does right that the other after it does not is have Cyclops be relevant.  This is the only movie that we get to see Cyclops do anything.

Some actors were miscast though.  Anna Paquin does not do a good job as Rogue.  I think she would have been better a Kiddy Pride.  The character of Rogue in this movie is a far cry from the character in the comics and the TV shows.  Rogue is supposed to be a spit-fire.  This Rogue is the complete opposite of that.  Halle Berry does okay as Storm, but there are plenty of people that could have played the role better.

The villain Magneto is a great in this film.  He is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen.  McKellen is one of my favorite actors.  He does great in every movie he is in whether the movie is good or bad.  He got the character of Magneto down to a tee.  Magneto is one of the best parts of the film.  I like him because he is not really a full villain but more of an antagonist.  You feel for him and can see where he is coming from.  I even like his ultimate plan in the film.  It is really not that bad of a plan if it wasn't for an unfortunate side effect. The other villains are very one-note and not worth talking about.

The score is nothing special.  The fight scenes are well done and entertaining.  The effects are quite good too.  I also love the social commentary the film presents, which X-Men is primarily based around.

Overall, I think X-Men is a decent and entertaining superhero film.  If you are a fan of X-Men definitely check it out.  However, do not expect anything too deep about the film.  Watch X2 for that.",1372118400,,2639,4.321063394683026
1263195,4,B00003CX8I,"X-Men is by far a good starting point for comic book turn into movies.  Looking back this came out when I was a senior in high school,  I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to the action and special effects.  I have to admit I was very pleased with what came of the outcome of the actors, special effects and directing.  I still have to watch the 2nd and 3rd movie of the X-Men trilogy, but this movie gives me lot of hope for when I do watch those movies later on this week.  Plus like most people I bought the movie for Wolverine and I also enjoy Storm.  But the other characters added lot to the mix and made the movie even more enjoyable to watch and added benifit got the movie for five dollars roughly from amazon.  So if your into comic book movies with loads of special effects, great acting by mutiple good actors and a plotline that you can believe then buy this movie if you don't already have it in your DVD collection because it will be worth the money for the movie.",1372032000,,985,4.152631578947369

1263224,4,B00003CX8I,"While having a sufficiency of gizmo's, combat and explosive situations, what raises this a notch above the ordinary is the weakness of the strongest and the conflict of equally legitimate ""solutions"" to the problem of whether those of extraordinary talents should be embraced within the common weal or excluded as enemies of the existing. Not that there is much emphasis on the latter point, it is,  in fact, pretty much downplayed. Yet, it does exist in the mind of the viewer, if only as the rationale for the action.
Perhaps, it is my total ignorance of the comic book source for the film; perhaps it is my unfamiliarity with the other X-Men films: however,  I made no sense out of the Concentration Camp scene with which the film commences. There is no follow-up in the story to account for the significance of an event leading to the body of the film.
I take it, this was the first of a series of movies made from the same comic book source; if so, it is a good lead-in, as well as being entertaining, in and of itself. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are both quite well suited to play leaders of the contesting ""deviant"" subgroups contesting for dominance for their viewpoint of how humans and the talented should interact. Both have the acting skills  and presence to make their leadership seem appropriate. The rest of the cast play their sometime deliberately ugly roles with suitable exaggeration.

I noticed this with the newest digital copies of X-men, ( all versions/sequels ) that I only can play it in standard stereo and no option is given to turn on DTS audio or even THX!! What a rip! I only bought the digital copies so I can play them from my Appletv and Mac with my surround receiver without having to insert the blueray copy into my player every time. ( It takes longer for the movie to bootup and the ridiculous anti piracy policy, as if that is going to stop a thief from violating the protection. ) The movie itself is an good action flick, which I am sure everyone by now, knows.

1263253,5,B00003CX8I,"I love, love, love, love, love superhero movies.  They have something for everyone.  They have action scenes and sometimes scantily clad women for the guys and they sometimes have romance and scantily clad men for the chicks.  They are not normally oscar contenders, but they are almost always one hell of a time.

The X-Men series is my favorite superhero series of all time.  It has the best characters, the best actors, the best romance, the best action scene and there is always the required scene of Hugh Jackman shirtless.  You can't beat this cast: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Anna Pacquin. All of them give wonderful performances.

Then this series has my favorite superhero of all time, Wolverine.  He is sexy, flawed, vulnerable and badass.  You just can't wait to see what he will do next.  Hugh Jackman has made this character his own and that makes for an awesome film.  Of course it only helps that he is surrounded by an outstanding cast.

I love that the X-men were born this way.  They didn't come from another planet, they weren't bit by a radioactive spider nor were they born with enough money to buy themselves enough toys.

Even the story line is fun and exciting.  They were able to weave in an interesting storyline while still spending a decent amount of time on characterization.

The weakest person in the bunch was Famke Janssen as the love interest.  I didn't get the attraction and there was no chemistry between her, James Marsden or Hugh Jackman.  Lynn Collins, from Wolverine Origins was much more plausible and effective.

This series is so good, that the best film in the series is the 4th installment.  What an amazing achievement.  I highly recommend all the movies in the X Men series.",1363219200,,1756,4.748344370860927

1263256,3,B00003CX8I,"I enjoyed this movie in theaters and recently re-watched it with a new eye. I offer this review to describe how this movie holds up ten years later.
Rogue/Wolverine:  I was presently surprised how effective the Rogue and Wolverine characters are. The movie introduction to both of these characters is captivating. Anna Paquin is charming as Rogue but doesn't quite have the Southern voluptousness Rogue usually is drawn to have in the comics. Hugh Jackman is also effective if maybe a little too Hollywood. The comic book Wolverine was much shorter and beastly. Jackman's got the persona down though.
Prof X/Magneto: Professor X and Magneto also have a strong introduction. Ian McKellen plays Magneto perfectly but he doesn't have the physical build that I imagined Magneto would have. I was especially disappointed in Magneto's helmet. It is an amazing aspect of Magneto's  costume but here it looks silly. It kinded reminded me of the first Spiderman. That early superhero movie also got the mask totally wrong for the villain green goblin. Patrick Stewart was an obvious choice for the professor so no problems there.
Cyclops/Jean: Cyclops is miscast. The actor who I now recognize from 30 Rock doesn't have the leadership persona or the physique to pull of Cyclops. For this reason Cyclop's confrontations with Wolverine don't carry any weight. No one can believe that this Cyclops can intimidate or hurt  Wolverine. His acting is a bit wooden too. Cyclops' headpiece is really large and clumsy. Ten years later its like seeing an old cell phone. Jean is well-cast and well-played. The actress playing her is appropriately beautiful and slightly vulnerable.
Storm/Sabretooth/Toad:  Halle Berry is not utilized well as Storm. She doesn't play the character that great anyway. Her African accent comes and goes and actually sounds sillly when you do hear it. Her character wasn't impressive and could have been left out I think. Sabretooth and Toad are poor villains. Their costumes are not very effective. Sabretooth doesn't have the presence he should. His costume and makeup don't impress. Its also never explained what his powers are. He is stabbed directly by Wolverine but doesn't even appear to be hurt. Toad';s costume is also not impressive. His green makeup looks really b-movie.
Storyline: The movie did a good job with the backstories of Magneto, Wolvie, and Rogue. Why didn't they introduce the rest? That would have made the movie more effective. There are so many brilliant storylines in the x-men cannon that I wonder why they chose this one about Magneto turning Senator Kelly/worldleaders into mutants. Overall it doesn't hold up that well.

Despite this, the movie holds up ok ten years later. It has the makings of a a great movie but makes a few too many missteps to make it worth watching more than once.",1361836800,,2828,5.034188034188034
1263257,4,B00003CX8I,"I'd actually never seen the first x-men movie. It defiantly filled in the holes I had from the other movies. In general, I am not a fan of superhero movies, they are ridiculous and usually don't have any kind of a decent plot, this movie is different. The story is about fighting discrimination, something many of us can easily relate to...and while the special effects are way over the top, they are most defiantly unique. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine makes the movie and his interplay with cyclops was genius. The second one is still my favorite, but this one was still really good. I highly recommend both it and the rest of the trilogy.",1361664000,,637,4.5964912280701755

1263290,5,B00003CX8I,"DC must have a child consultant on their movies, bc all of them are bad. Marvel--on the other hand--has plenty of good ones! The XMEN Movie Series, the Spiderman Movie Series, the Blade Series, Fantastic 4, Hulk, etc. They've had some duds, too(Iron Man, Fantastic 4 II, Elektra, Blade Trinity, the 2nd Hulk movie, Daredevil, etc.), but that total comes to 10 to 0 against DC(if you count movies with lasting impact). Might I add, that's also in a shorter frame of time.

X-MEN movies point indirectly to the Civil Rights Struggle or Battle For Equality/Freedom To Thrive. Sub mutants in for minorities/undesirables and humans in for RACIST whites/intolerant people and X-MEN comes into clearer focus. This movie features leader and professor Xavier(extraordinary, unbelievable mental control-- enhanced even more by Cerebro: a device that gives Xavier scanning, pinpointing, and other special extras) who runs his school for mutants(usually powerful) which doubles as a defense agency. The hands-on agency particularly deals with mutant vs. human rights/affairs--with no quarter given to either side. Xavier's mutants important to this movie are Cyclops (field leader and has a powerful optic blast), Jean Grey(Cyclops' wife and controls objects with her mind plus is slightly psychic), Storm(the power of the weather--any of them), Wolverine(unbreakably metallic claws; unbreakably metallic skeleton; heightened senses despite being a heavy smoker; and almost instantaneous healing ability from almost any illness or injury), Iceman(generates ice), and Rogue(can absorb another's life force: partly or completely & their feelings/memories/abilities for a relatively short time; when doing so, she weakens the victim and can kill, if prolonged). Iceman and Rogue are teenagers and numbered as apart of the children: not allowed to fight at this point. They try to use peace to solve their problems, but, in situations where this is not possible or their special abilities give them an added boost, they will use their abilities. His team of mutants also have access to a state of the art jet. Enter their problem in this movie: Magneto(decades ago, he and Xavier were tight friends working for Xavier's transcendent goal until Magneto's--prior to officially becoming Magneto--family gets killed by humans) now regards Xavier as a civil acquaintance and will attack anything or anyone who interferes with his mission: mutant superiority to humans. Helping him are likeminded mutants: Mystique(shifts into the form of other people), Toad(super long tongue and frog like abilities), and Sabretooth(stronger than Wolverine and has his healing ability without the metallic claws). Magneto plans on turning all humans into mutants and this involves the death of Rogue and all the death of the humans to which this machine's energy is applied. The old friends' missions always clash and, many times, battles break out. Magneto and Xavier clash in a dramatic scene from a comic scene standpoint. Storm clashes with Sabertooth and Toad(both relatively short, but dramatic battles). Wolverine clashes with Mystique and Sabertooth(pretty good battles). Magneto is a magnetic giant; while, Wolverine has a metallic skeleton. Mystique and Toad are at least as agile as Spider-Man--no X-man is agile(all but Wolverine are static or stiff). Sabertooth is a good bit stronger than any X-man and he heals up like Wolverine, too. Magneto has a helmet that protects him from mental probing and can fly like Jean Grey or Storm, so that cancels out Xavier, Storm, or Jean Grey there. It's almost as if the X-men, though being power heavy, are handicapped against those enemies. This all comes to a head and a good comic book ending. The best of the series. 5 Stars out of 5.",1359417600,,3754,5.330522765598651

1263341,2,B00003CX8I,"This movie was really terrible...

 Out of the many Super hero movies to come out since 2000-2012 the X-men series to me was the worst and the one that followed the comic book the least. To me this is like watching Dragon Ball Evolution, it's just that horrible.

 I really still to this day don't understand why people say they love this film even fellow X-men fans because I don't get it. Ever since I was a kid I used to collect the cards, read the comic books, play with the toys, watch the show and play the games. A real live X-men movie was something of a fantasy, and to find out it was actually happening was a dream come true. Anyone who has ever cracked open a comic book or watched the Saturday morning cartoon show on Fox knows that this movie is NOT the X-men and neither were any of the sequels this thing spawned. Some characters did look good like Mystique haha no I take that back. They all look as though the person that designed them for the movie never read the comic book. Mystique is a vixen and a sexy blue skinned red haired seductress not a lizard woman but, that's just many problems I had with the movie.

 For starters with the custom design not even in the picture it's really about how they portray the X-men and their relationships to one another. First of all the X-men even though not officially act as a military group. They have Ranks and Teams that they work with under the command of Professor X. Storm leads one Team and Cyclops leads another. Storm is not a background character she is key figure and 2nd in command to Professor X. She is the Xavier's Right hand and Scott is his left hand. Now that leads to other things about this movie that are off. Wolverines relationship with other characters in this movie. For one thing Wolverine does not like Cyclops and he doesn't bother himself with him unless he has too which means he mostly spends his time around storm when it comes to finding out what he needs to know or getting his orders. Storm and Wolverine are actually very close friends and he's probably closer to her than just about anyone on the team.

 Which leads to another problem with the movie when Rouge is introduced. Wolverine and Rouge are not buddy buddy their just acquaintances like Co-workers. Rouge is also a grown woman and not a little girl. Jubilee however is a young teenage girl that Wolverine adores and she looks up to and admires him. For some reason this movie completely turns character roles and relationships around and that breaks the story completely.

So as you watch the movie you think to yourself mostly ... ""what?"" ... ""that's not how that happens?"" ""What the?"" .. hey ""why did they do that?"" and so on and so fourth. Basically they completely rewrote the story of X-men just to fit it into the big screen. This is mostly a movie about Wolverine,Cyclopes&Jean Grey all the other X-men are just background characters. I did enjoy seeing Magneto and some of the other Brotherhood of Mutant villains in this one but, they kind of ruin them in a way as well. The villians in X-men aren't really Villains, they both want the same goal but just go about achieving it in a different way. Xavier wants to coexists with humans and Magneto wants to eradicate them. The movie never really explores the characters in that right and just makes this seem like another good guy stops bad guy comic book movie and that is NOT what X-men is about. The villians are just as favored as the heroes and both sides should have been explored and explained better I think.

They tried with this one and it was a hit with mostly people who don't know much about the X-men but for the rest of us we were expecting to see our beloved comic book characters come to life and it didn't really happen. The characters in the movie are much much much weaker than they are in the comic books. I didn't understand that part at all as the other movies that came later like the Hulk,Iron Man, Fantastic 4 and all the rest did a good job at showing the strength of the characters but the X-men really didn't do to well at that. Especially with Storm and Wolverine.

Overall this move came and we all went to see it and it was a hit but, I don't feel like the X-MEN got the type of movie treatment that they really deserved.",1353888000,,4269,4.404822335025381

I found the first part of the movie more interesting than the last half where all the fireworks take place.

1263370,5,B00003CX8I,"In the summer of 2000 my dreams were finally realized. An X-Men movie was released. Going into this I had no idea if they could pull it off, but did they ever. The story was amazing, the acting was amazing, and the visuals were pretty good for the time period. This is the first time I had ever seen Hugh Jackman in any movie. I had no idea if he could pull of the lead character of Wolverine, because he is much taller than him in the comics. But he did an amazing job, and became one of my favorite actors. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen also nailed their characters of Xavier and Magneto. The story is great as it takes you through Wolverine's shoes while he has to decide if he wants to join the X-men as they fight against the brotherhood of mutants. Wolverine is conflicted on which side is the right side to take, but chooses the side of the X-Men. Bryan Singer did an amazing job directing this masterpiece and Michael Kamen provided the score to the film. This and X2 are in my opinion the best X-Men movies, but they go downhill from there unfortunately.",1342310400,,1066,4.335

1263374,4,B00003CX8I,"I knew that the codes for digital copies expire, with a general rule of thumb of one year from the date the disc is released.  Amazon lists this product's release date as May 3, 2011, so that was just beyond that window, but figured I'd give it a shot.  I already owned the DVD and just wanted to complete my Blu-ray collection, and besides, at the time of my order the Blu-ray only version and this bundle were almost the same price.

So in using the installer for the digital copy, I selected the iTunes version and was greeted with the message, ""This application requires iTunes 7.6 or higher"".  7.6?  Whoa.  That version was released in late 2008.  I tried redeeming the code directing through iTunes with the DVD inserted as the device, but that resulted in an odd message, ""This code is for an offer not yet available. It cannot be used yet.""

So one last shot and contacted Fox Connect customer support, but after a few rounds of emails and only getting canned responses back, I gave up.

I gave this product 4/5 stars because it is still a great bundled value.  Although it can't compare to today's films such as Avengers, it still holds a valued spot in my collection as one of the early pioneers in the revival of the super hero movie genre.

1263376,5,B00003CX8I,"2000's X-Men, directed by Bryan Singer, could have gone wrong on so many levels, and while it does have some minor flaws here and there, I still find it one of the best cinematic interpretions of a comic book property ever produced. I am a major Marvel fanatic, and I love the X-Men in particular. The notion of a group of superhumans born, or ""cursed"" depending on the various points of view, with their special abilities is always an intriguing one, and comics writer/creator Stan Lee set up such a unique legend with the whole intolerance/racism angle most humans have against the mutant population on Earth. Some mutants, such as Professor Charles Xavier, a telepath and founder of the X-Men team of adventurers, want to teach understanding and acceptance for mutants and humans alike, while others, like Magneto, who can control magnetism and was a prisoner of the Nazi death camps, view humans as scum to be ruled over by ""Homo Superior"".

The film follows the character of Logan/Wolverine, well played by then newcomer Hugh Jackman, as he reluctantly joins our heroes in a quest to stop the villianous Magneto (a strong, compelling Ian McKellan) and his Brotherhood of Mutants (The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in the comic books) from using a machine that would turn all humans into mutants...to ""even us out"".

The story couldve been beefed up in some aspects, yet this was just the first intro to the mythology on-screen, and it still works; some flaws I had a little trouble with included the notion of the great villian Sabretooth (here played by Tyler Mane) being somewhat subservient to Magneto, sort of like a brainless henchman. If you know the character from the comics, Sabretooth is one of the most vile, cold blooded and actually quite intelligent and cunning supervillians ever created. Rounding out the bad guys is Mystique (played by Rebecca Romajn Stamos), a murderous shapeshifter, and Toad (Ray Park), who has incredible agility and a whip-like tongue.

In the X-Men, we have Cyclops (James Marsden), the leader, who shoots destructive energy beams from his eyes, though his curse is he cant control them without a ruby quartz visor to wear, Jean Grey (Famke Jenssen) a telepath/telekinetic, Storm, whose screen characterization could have been beefed up as well as Cyclop's since they are two of the most compelling characters of the group, is played by Halle Berry. She can manipulate the elements (rain, wind, etc). Rounding it out is Rogue (Anna Paguin), whose mutant ability involves touching and absorbing the physical abilities of those around here, sometimes with dire consequences. The great Patrick Stewart plays Prof Xavier. He brings a quiet, understated fatherly authority to the film, and his presence is felt even when hes not on screen.

Jackman does a very good job as Wolverine, and it makes you wonder how farther he can go with it, since Wolverine is by far one of the most fun, complex and challenging antiheroes in comics. Personally I felt Jackman was a tad too tall for the role, but he does bring a surly, belligerant yet noble and heroic attitude to Wolverine, which feels right if you know what the character is all about psychologically.

The SFX are good but don't overwhelm the story and characters, and Singer directs with a moody, dark vision that thankfully doesnt play down the world these complicated characters inhabit, and actually takes this storyline seriously. ""X-Men"" works very well indeed with what it has to begin with.",1335312000,,3488,4.955555555555556
1263377,4,B00003CX8I,"Energetic, surprisingly loyal action / adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight, cohesive visual style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are brilliant choices as Xavier and Magneto, dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum, but don't get nearly enough scenes together. Of course, Hugh Jackman absolutely defines the role of Wolverine, playing a very clearly defined, potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor. The film's not entirely confident in itself, evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief (basically anything that comes out of Halle Berry's mouth), but considering its age and status as the make-or-break point for comic book properties (spoiler: it made) I can overlook a few missteps. Light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather, titanium veneer and bright, colorful effects.",1334361600,,945,5.391891891891892
1263408,5,B00003CX8I,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.

The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.

Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X2-X-Men-United-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0000BWVCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X2: X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>"" (2003) and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-The-Last-Stand-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000HCO83Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" (2006).

""X-Men"" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the general plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are presented and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and understandably opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as Iceman and Pyro. Both groups meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which I believe is the weakest part of the film.

Regardless, when I saw ""X-Men"" in the theater in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the great quality of many of those flicks.

I think, being the introduction to all the amazing characters like Rogue, Wolverine, Professor Xavier himself (whom I so loved as a child I named my only son Xavier after!), Magneto, Storm, and so many others their names escape me at the moment!  But my point is movies where so many main characters are introduced, usually the first in the series, are often the best, because these are the movies where you meet and get to know and fall in love with said characters, as you do so here.  And you come along a main evil, humanity, which wants to rid the world of mutants.  And there are also so many sub-stories, sub-origin stories as well.  Like where everyone is coming from, their backstories, how they are meeting and coming to Professor Xavier's school, coming together, and on the reverse how the other, ""bad"" mutants are coming to Magneto's side, etc., and the other stories, and love plots, between Jean and Wolverine and with Rogue wanting so badly to make a connection and being unable to touch anyone.  This is also Anna Paquin's big coming out, playing Rogue, her first big part on the big screen (now as Sookie Stackhouse in the True Blood series), and she really makes her mark and nails this part like no other could.  But the whole cast is cinematic Gold.  It is a Stars Buffet to be had, and this is definitly THE disc to get!

As for the film itself: if you're a purist regarding the comics, you might not like it, but I have always found the earlier X Men films to be well acted and well written. Sirs Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart do quite well as Magneto and Charles Xavier, and Hugh Jackman makes a solid and admittedly attractive Wolverine. So, as before, there are deviations from the comics, but the film in itself is entertaining and intelligent. The X-Men is one of my favorite superhero films.",1311552000,,753,4.619402985074627

I know most fans don't like how a lot of things were changed but I don't think it would have been as effective a movie had it been loyal to the original comics (see watchmen). The movie is not perfect but it is revolutionary, before this movie super heroes were silly, stupid and exclusive to kids but now the characters are brought to adult situations and everybody can relate to them.

In what I think is one of the best adaptation from comics, X-Men 1 and 2 deserves to be the winners. Bryan Singer and his team managed to turn this comic series into modern day ""reality"".

I won't go into the movie details but if you think about it. Mutation may just happen in the near future or very soon. Imagine being prejudiced against because you can move metal/things, read minds, transformed into anyone, blast off a mountain with just your eyes etc. When it does happen, what would you do:

1. Join Magneto and wipe out the human race as what Ian McKellen's character said ""We are the future, not them Charles?"" OR
2. Join Professor X and learn to earn their trust and show them we're are humans too as what Patrick Stewart's character said ""If no one is to oppose them (i.e. Magneto and gang), humanity days would be over.""

The storyline is close to the heart, what if you are gay, a jew, a minority race that is considered ""not normal"" in the eyes of everyone else...

This movie does great along those lines. Great action is useless without great storyline. X-men 1 and 2 hits bull's eye!

P.S. Give X-Men 3 a miss please, it was pure fluff and utter rubbish with only great CGI and poor storyline. I blame 20th Century Fox for not willing to wait for Bryan Singer and gang to come back with a powerhouse story for X3.",1307145600,,1592,4.434931506849315

The film stays true to the comic book and never turns into camp. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman were inspired choices for Professor Charles Xavier(a.k.a. Professor X) and Wolverine. X-Men takes place in a world where mutants are oppressed by ""normal people"". Mutants led by Professor Xavier try to be tolerant while mutants led by Magneto(Ian McKellan) are radical and extremist! Magneto has a diabolical weapon that can turn ""normal people"" into mutants!
 Director Bryan Singer(The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil, House, Superman Returns) takes the X-Men story seriously. The late Michael Kamen wrote a solid music score for X-Men. The scene where Wolverine and Sabertooth fight on the Statue of Liberty is an homage to A Man Called Hero(1999). X-Men has a fair amount of humor. Cyclops(James Marsden) asks Wolverine if he ""wants yellow spandex"". Anna Paquin is quite good as a teenage version of Rogue. Ray Park isn't bad as Toad.

1263538,4,B00003CX8I,"The reason I use that statement as my review title is that, while this film is good, much like `Spider-Man' and `Batman Begins', this film is trumped massively by the sequel.  That aside, this film is still very good for the genre that it finds itself in.  Superhero movies can be hard to make because there are so many devoted fans to please, and there is no way that one can perfectly transfer a comic book to the big screen.  Still, as far as they come, this is one of the better installments.

It's a shame that the third film was such a cluttered mess (it's still better than `Spider-Mess 3').

This film establishes the conflict between former friends Professor Xavier (Professor X) and Magneto, formerly known as Eric Lensherr.  Lensherr, facing prejudice his entire life, suffers greatly at the hands of an unkind and unsympathetic human race, who regard mutants as below them and continue to misunderstand and mistreat them.  Xavier and Lensherr, once comrades, are now rivals as their viewpoints on the world have begun to contradict one another.  Xavier believes in patience, for he feels that humans are universally good and that they will learn to accept mutants as equals, but Lensherr has grown to despise humanity and feels that the only key to happiness would be a human-free (and mutant inhabited) world.

Thus sets the basis for the first installment in the X-Men franchise, and as Xavier's school for mutants and Magneto's band of thugs set off in search of the same girl, a young mutant named Rogue, chaos ensues.

That good kind of action sequence chaos.

When it comes to superhero films, the most important (or one of the most important) things to consider is the cast.  You have leagues of devoted fans waiting to put a face to the hero they have followed for years, and so `nailing' that aspect of the film is key.  For a film that is littered with heroes and villains, `X-Men' definitely has some inspired casting.  For any fan of the comic, I think there was only ONE choice for Professor X, and they got that one right.  Near unknowns (I say near because they weren't, and still aren't, BIG NAME stars) Famke Janssen and James Marsden filled out their respective roles very nicely (Janssen is a perfect Jean Grey) and Oscar winner Anna Paquin was the perfect choice for Rogue.  Ian McKellen is perfect as Magneto, and while I find that Storm didn't have much to chew on, Berry was a nice (if a tad obvious) choice.

But seriously, this is the film that introduced Hugh Jackman to the world, and no matter how awesome the rest of the cast may be, Wolverine was the most important casting decision, and Jackman is absolutely outstanding!

It lacks the polish of `X2: United', but it sets a nice tone for the franchise and really works in the origin stories without feeling rushed, stuffed or forced.  There is plenty of action, drama, romance and wit; and a naked blue Rebecca Romijn serves up some oddly stimulating eye-candy.  For what it is, this movie is pretty great.  I'd give it a solid B+, verging on an A-.",1267488000,,3042,4.648598130841122
1263539,5,B00003CX8I,"X Men succesfully balances the comics with reality, example having a starandized uniform for the X Men instead of everyone having their own unique spandex suit.

In this movie their are three powers at work, mutants that try to convince normal humans that mutants are no better or worse than normal humans and want to be completely intergrated into society without any fear, mutants that have suffered because of fear that they cause normal and normal humans in thet middle trying to decide if all mutants should be treated as threats or if they're like any other devision of humanity.

1263543,4,B00003CX8I,"I believe that the first film in the X-Men film franchise was a solid start. As the title says, this is what an X-Men movie should be like. I like how the movie doesn't make the mistake of introducing too many mutants at once, since I don't think that there would've been enough time to flesh everyone out. With that said, I am also very happy that they did not go too in depth with characters. This way, there is more room left to explore character's origins in the future films.
While the action is forgettable, the story still progressed well. Characters developed nicely with highlights including Wolverine and Rouge's friendship and Xavier and Magneto's opposite ideologies for humans and mutants. The setting for the movie revolving around increased tension between humans and mutants was established quite well. All in all, director Bryan Singer did a good job. Original story, dialogue, and music make this movie something that will be cherished by both X-Men fans and newcomers alike.
The movie keeps true to the comic book, but it doesn't come without its tweaks. Certain tweaks were expected, but some tweaks stand out more than others. The complicated and interesting rivalry between Wolverine and Sabretooth is... well... its not really there. Sure the two go at it a couple times in the movie, (and they take a disliking to each other quick), but the dialouge between them is pretty much absent. And Toad... well don't expect that funny, pitiful lackey of Magneto. In this movie he is actually quite dangerous. While these tweaks don't bother me too much, they're just minor examples of some changes made from the original comic book franchise.",1249603200,,1658,4.903914590747331

An excellent adaptation of the popular comic books from Marvel that started a different trend on superheroes created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Bryan Singer who did the excellent ""Usual Suspects"" was born to do these movies except for the third as he really took the comics metaphor on discrimination of different people well to the big screen after years of development hell even with Carolco originally wanting the rights but Fox came to save it. The acting is quite excellent including the action sequences as i love how this Sci-fi movie plays as a movie about racism in the future and how to try to be accepted by mankind. I love how this movie introduces audiences to a different cinematic superhero then Batman or Superman back in 2000 who is Wolverine making him the best superhero ever! it was followed by an equally awesome yet even better sequel.

At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Still, this DVD holds up.

Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.

As for the story, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects.

1263547,4,B00003CX8I,"In the year 2000, Marvel Comics in association with 20th Century Fox officially ushered in the current age of superhero movies with the successful box office smash ""X-Men"". Truthfully, out of all of their vast properties to adapt for the silver screen, the X-Men seemed in my estimation to be one of the riskiest endeavors for Marvel in terms of being a hit. I felt it was a risky choice if for no other reason than the fact that the X-Men universe is so rich and diverse that it would seem almost impossible to winnow it down to a manageable level that could easily fit into a 90 minute or two hour running time. Yet, despite a few minor flaws in the story and/or some tweaks to some characters, the difficult task was accomplished in an extremely impressive fashion under the watchful eye of talented director Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"").

""X-Men"" is the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has the unique ability to heal from any wound along with unsheathing razor-sharp adamantium (an unbreakable metal) claws from his hands, as he struggles to find the truth about himself, while helping a young mutant named Rogue (Anna Paquin). During their journey the two encounter a team of mutants led by the enigmatic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that somehow both humans and mutants can find a way to peacefully co-exist with one another. However, for every school of thought there is an equally strong opposing viewpoint, and this one is led by a powerful and extremely angry mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellan). As battle lines are being drawn, Wolverine and Rogue find themselves stuck in the middle of a war they never knew existed, and are forced to choose a side to stand with before time runs out.

The story for ""X-Men"" as written by David Hayter (""Watchmen"") provided a very nice and neat introduction into the expansive universe that these iconic characters inhabit. While this initial film featured a relatively focused story that revolved around the two pivotal roles of Wolverine and Rogue and their quest for answers and acceptance, it hinted at the potential for a much bigger story to follow on a much grander scale. For most franchises to succeed, especially those that could be deemed risky, you need the initial story to be a little smaller in scope in order to draw your audience in and establish the groundwork of relationships with which further sequels can build upon. Writer David Hayter understood this and crafted a very tight and concise script that moved along at an almost relentless pace, yet without really skimping on too many of the details. For comic book fans there were numerous nods or references to either events or characters from the comics, but this movie wasn't just for the fanboys. The wisest decision that 20th Century Fox and Marvel made was to make these characters as accessible to those outside of the world of comics as possible, but at the same time not making such drastic changes so as to alienate your core fan base. All of this was achieved with the story for ""X-Men"" and as I said a moment ago, it served as the perfect jumping point for this series to expand from.

Bringing the film to life was director Bryan Singer, who with this movie brought to comic book films something that had been noticeably absent for many years...a semi-grounded sense of reality not too dissimilar from our own (apart from the whole super-powered thing mind you). Previous to this film (and for that matter the first ""Blade"" film), the only truly successful comic book movies were those in the initial Batman franchise, and in each of those movies we found a very eccentric, gothic-inspired reality that was more outlandish and showy. For me I appreciated the fact that Bryan chose to steep these films in a reality that was much more recognizable to our own rather than one much more fantastic. By doing this we are able to better relate to the characters, and therefore become immersed in the story, allowing for a much easier suspension of our disbelief (which every fantasy and/or sci-fi film relies upon).

Besides the look and feel of the film, Bryan also excelled in creating some really fun, entertaining action sequences that at times felt like they were the very panels of a comic book coming to life. As a fan of comic books and some of the comic book films that had come prior to this film's release, I was pleased to watch an adaptation that knew how to blend the action elements together with intriguing character development. Generally these types of films had been written off as no more than summer fluff at the box office, and nine times out of ten this had been proven true. Not since 1989's ""Batman"" (to my recollection) had a comic book movie effectively blended those two all-important elements together to such a great degree of success. So, for this adaptation to buck the established order of things (so to speak), and actually include a coherent story rife with interesting characters along with the obvious entertainment factor inherent in most visual effects movies was a bit unheard of. Thankfully, Bryan Singer and his writer David Hayter, along with everyone else involved in the decision making behind the scenes of ""X-Men"" were smart enough to create a film that stayed somewhat true to the notion that this was a summer blockbuster, but also a movie that contained some great drama and could please audiences for years to come beyond its stay at the box office.

Starring in this film is quite the varied group of talented actors and actresses ranging from veterans of both stage and screen, such as Sir Ian McKellan (""Apt Pupil"") and Patrick Stewart (""Star Trek: Nemesis""), to some of Hollywood's great beauties like Famke Janssen (""Taken"") and Halle Berry (""Swordfish"") to relative new faces like Anna Paquin (""Fly Away Home"") and Hugh Jackman (""Someone Like You""). What was great about this cast is that each member brought a seriousness to the role and portrayed these comic book characters as if they were any other dramatic role, opting not to play up the camp factor that would have been the order of the day in previous years past (for example the much maligned ""Batman & Robin""). For a majority of the actors and actresses chosen for the various mutants, and humans for that matter, the casting appeared to be strokes of genius and good fortune combined, as each one looked as if they had manifested directly from the comic book page.

Perhaps the biggest surprise casting choice, for me at least, would be a then unknown Hugh Jackman as the fan favorite Wolverine. Having not seen Jackman in anything prior to this film I wasn't sure if he could do justice to the clawed hero; however, I was completely blown away by the intensity and ferocity that Jackman brought to the role. His portrayal is so spot-on that it reached the point that his interpretation became almost universally accepted by the comic book fan community as being the one true Wolverine. A move that is surprising given that this community is generally extremely finicky about sticking to the details of their beloved heroes, not to mention the fact that Jackman is over 6' tall, lean, yet still muscular rather than being a short, and semi-stocky, but extremely muscular guy that would more closely resemble his comic book counterpart. With that knowledge one could see how surprising it is that his portrayal was so easily accepted, but I guess when it's clear that he's the ideal person for the role, some details can be overlooked for the greater good of the franchise.

""X-Men"" was a very well written, directed, and acted movie that gave comic book fans and audiences in general something that everyone could enjoy. For comic book fans there were some minor gripes about changes made to some of the characters origins, but nothing significant enough to take away from how great this movie was, or what it would mean for other comic book characters being brought to life on the big screen. Even after all the comic book movies that have bowed since this film's opening, ""X-Men"" still remains one of my all-time favorites of the genre, a fact that I don't see changing anytime in the near future.

1263593,4,B00003CX8I,"""X-Men"" is based on the Marvel comic-book series and hit the big screen in 2000. Directed by Bryan Singer, the film stars - amongst others - Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn.

Mutants are seen as the next step in humankind's evolution and born with a slightly different genetic makeup - a variation that generally brings a superpower with it. You won't necessarily be able to tell just by looking at someone they're a mutant, however - in many cases, mutants look just like normal humans. In fact, only three of the characters in the film - Toad, Mystique and Sabretooth - look anyway different. In most cases, a mutant won't even know that they are a mutant until they reach puberty - which is generally when their powers 'switch on'. Throw in an unhealthy dose of widespread anti-mutant sentiment, and an over-complicated adolescence gets even worse.

Rogue is one such teenager. The poor girl enjoys her first kiss, and sees her young boyfriend collapse into a coma. Unfortunately for Rogue, her mutant superpower is destined to make her lonelier than most : skin-on-skin contact with another human will see her absorbing that person's life-force. (Although she doesn't know it at first, touching another mutant will also see her - briefly - gaining that mutant's superpower). In a blind panic, she flees - running more or less randomly to small-town Alaska. There, she finally has a bit of luck - when she runs into Wolverine, a cagefighter who's also a mutant. Originally known as Logan, Wolverine has an adamantium skeleton, a very sensitive nose, and a hyperactive healing factor. (You can injure him - he just won't stay injured for very long). However, he doesn't have much of a past - Wolverine's life is a mystery even to him. Unfortunately, the pair have barely made their introductions before they're dragged into a war...

On their way out of town, Rogue and Wolverine are attacked by Sabretooth - a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, led my Magneto. Luckily, two X-Men called Storm and Cyclops arrive to help, and take the pair back to their base in New York State. The initial assumption is that Magneto wanted Wolverine for some reason. The X-Men's leader - Professor Charles Xavier, the world's most powerful telepath and a one-time friend of Magneto's - wants to find out why. He asks Wolverine agrees to stay a little while and, in return, the Prof will try to help Logan remember his past. Rogue, meanwhile, is enrolled at the  Professor's School for Gifted Youngsters. The school could be viewed as a cover of sorts : the Professor's abilities are not public knowledge, though the 'gifted youngsters' are actually mutants. The purpose of the school is to train young mutants how to properly - and responsibly - control and use their powers. The Professor also believes humans and mutants can live peacefully, side-by-side - Magneto, on the other hand, disagrees.

Magneto is not alone in his belief : Senator Kelly - a 'standard', though influential, human - sees mutants as something to be feared and, therefore, requiring control. The Senator very strongly advocates the Mutant Registration Act, though he wants even more than that. ""If it were up to me"", he says ""I'd lock them all away"". If it weren't for people like Kelly raising the stakes and talking of imprisoning people without trial, this war may never have needed fought...

A cracking superhero movie overall. There's a bit more of Wolverine than any of the other heroes, though there is a heavy side-order of Rogue - who I liked a lot more onscreen, than did in print. (I was very impressed with Paquin's performance as Rogue, and also Romijn as Mystique. A member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Mystique is a shapeshifter. However, while she doesn't look human in her natural form, she does look very cool). The sparring between Cyclops and Wolverine also worked very well, and provided a few comic moments. I wasn't too impressed with Storm, though - her contribution to the movie was pretty much non-existent. That may well have been down to the writing, but I'm not sure Halle Berry was all that bothered about making the most of her screen-time. Still, other than that, a very enjoyable show.",1222300800,,4273,4.862637362637362
1263594,4,B00003CX8I,"The special effects are good. The characters are simple and varied enough to make us like that universe of monstrous mutants that look just like us but can turn into whatever they want. Welcome to Carrie, Christine, Firestarter, the Tommyknockers and many other Stephen King paranormal beings and situations. Of course, this film adds to that berserk universe a good old American wrapping but with a twist. The statue of liberty standing on its nice little island as the symbol of what it is called after and yet looking like a stiletto stabbing the sky  and jutting out of a flat no man's seascape. The twist is in the fact that it is this very statue that is going to be the epicenter of the destruction of all the heads of states assembled at the United Nations for the general assembly of this world's forum. This American wrapping is the standard bigot position of a senator against mutants, against people who are different, who rejects them and kills them as fast as possible. And the twist is that this senator is kidnapped by the bad mutants, transmuted himself by them and then discarded to die in any odd place away from them. And before dying he is saved by the good mutants and he even comes to like them. Finally the main twist is that there are good mutants and in this film, temporarily, they win and save humanity from a cataclysm that would have destroyed both humanity and mutant-dom. Then the rest is not even sentimental episodes. It is pure action and mission and some fights, and a lot of visual special effects. That makes a nice entertaining film though on no matrix whatsoever except maybe the very very distant faraway relation to a certain Quasimodo in Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo: the ugly monster is the savior of the beautiful gypsy girl all the normal Parisians want to victimize and kill.

1263595,4,B00003CX8I,"Looking back on this movie now, after having watched a plethora of super hero movies, I can honestly say this is a decent movie, but not a GREAT one.

This movie was actually one of my first introductions to the world of super heroes (I'd only previously seen the first two Spider-Man movies before watching this and hadn't ever picked up a comic book) so I look back on it with a sense of nostalgia if nothing else. The plot is essentially the essence of the X-Men comics: people who were born different vying for acceptance in a world that fears and hates them, while attempting to stop the ""villain"" from carrying out his evil plot. (I say ""villain"" because I'm not really sure if Magneto counts as a villain, if you get right down to it. He and Professor Xavier are basically two sides of the same coin. But, I digress.) It has generally good acting, with one or two exceptionally excellent or horrid performances, and the script...well, it works, usually. What this movie is, more than anything, is a setup for X2, which is by far the best of the series and (in my opinion) one of the better super hero movies in existence. But this first X-Men movie is a solid effort, and a fun watch, if only because Ian McKellen or Patrick Stewart are in it (for the movie buffs) or because there are explosions (for the action fan). And even I, who is generally underwhelmed by the character of Wolverine, have to admit that Hugh Jackman played him perfectly. The only other part I've seen so well-cast is Aragorn of The Lord of the Rings.",1217376000,2,1532,4.4714285714285715

I saw ""X-Men"" shortly after seeing ""Fantastic Four,"" and it suffers greatly by comparison. The only non-cardboard characters are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), and even then Wolverine was too much the nice guy instead of an antihero. This also may be Patrick Stewart's worst movie yet, and Ian McKellen doesn't come out much better. The other actors simply chew the scenery. And -- again, even for a comic book -- the plot holes are enormous. E.g., where did the billions of dollars come from to construct the underground complex at Xavier's private school? (I hate to think what the tuition bills are like. . . .) The original Superman and Batman flicks are proof that a good film of this type is possible.",1203379200,,856,4.713333333333333

1263600,4,B00003CX8I,"As an adaptation, I think, this outing from Marvel's partnerships with Hollywood isn't quite as good as the first two Spiderman films.  Of course, the special effects are splendid (Storm calling up the weather, Magneto at work, his henchman Toad hopping about flourishing an incredible tongue, shapechanger Mystique, and Wolverine's claws, to name a few), and Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier was an inspired casting choice.  But there's a certain darkness to the movie that isn't just about Marvel angst (I would have preferred to see the costumes from the original comics rather than a generic uniform, for one thing).  What's more, the focus is less on the X-Men as a whole than on Wolverine (perhaps to be expected considering his fan base!) and Magneto.  And even without being able to read Magneto's mind, it seems that a genius like Xavier, with the advantage of his long acquaintance with Magneto, would at least entertain the possibility that it's Rogue, not Wolverine, that he wants.  (Wolvie, after all, has apparently been out and about for a while before we meet him by way of Rogue, the newly-fledged Mississipian mutant who has run away from home in terror of what her powers do to people.)  On the other hand, Magneto is a villain with whom one can almost sympathize (especially considering that we learn early on that he survived the Nazi Holocaust and therefore fears that mutants may be the target of another such program--or should that be pogrom?).  I'm hoping that the subsequent chapters will give Cyclops, Jean Gray, and Storm more chance to shine.  On balance, though, it's a well-done action movie with a strong underlying message, and could well serve as a springboard for some good family discussions.",1202342400,,1728,4.955017301038063

1263602,5,B00003CX8I,"This fantastic sci-fi/action film made in 2000 is a good versus evil super hero type.

The movie opens with a scene out of World War II that shows people who are born different from the ruling society, being treated cruely.  One of these people turns out to be the villianous character, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto holds a grudge against mankind and has an accomplice, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) who can change into many shapes and forms.

We are introduced to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)who runs a school for mutants that teaches them to harness their powers for the good of mankind.  These mutants possess extraordinary and dangerous powers which are the result of genetic mutations. Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) grows metal weapons from his fists.  Cyclops (James Marsden) unleashes bolts of energy from his eyes. Storm (Halle Berry) can manipulate the weather. Rogue (Annna Paquin) absorbs the life force of anyone she touches. But these mutants must protect those who fear them as Magneto reveals his  plan for the future!

I wanted to see all the X Men movies as my friend is currently working on the prequel, ""Wolverine"" starring Hugh Jackman in Australia and I promised him I would view them all.

1263603,3,B00003CX8I,"Bryan Singer has created a great opening to the X-Men movie franchise. The key to this type of film is not to play it too comic bookish and also not to play it too seriously. Singer does a good job on both counts. With great casting and a quickly moving plot line the X-Men movie is a pleasure to watch and as Singer puts it in his commentary a good trailer for the next movie in the series.

There are many characters in the X-Men universe but the film wisely introduces the viewer to a small group of them who will be essential to the story. In the America of the not too distant future a debate rages as to whether mutants (those with special powers) should be made to register with the government. To Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) this is just too close to his childhood which was spent in a Polish concentration camp. He has gathered his Brotherhood of Mutants in order to battle this registration scheme. He intends to use a special radiation emitting device which will turn all into mutants. His group includes Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) the Toad (Ray Park) and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn).

Opposing the Brotherhood's Plans id Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who believes in a peaceful existence between mutants and the humans. He runs a school for mutant children that preaches inclusion rather than fear and exclusion. His star students who teach at his Academy have not rejoined the world. They are the X-Men. The X-Men that are featured are the weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry), the lasar eyed Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Into his group comes a teen who cannot touch others, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and a man who has been equipped with claw like weapons named Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).

To give away more of the story would ruin the fun. This is the best type of action movie both intelligent and quick moving. One can only hope that future movies in the series will follow the same outline. I viewed this film in the special two-disc edition that includes the director commentary, an extended viewing mode with 17 incorporated branching featurettes and a number of special features introduced by Singer on a second disc.

Not so with X-Men!  For once, just the right touch!  Not overplayed, not underplayed, told us enough to make the story believable, didn't mire down in fantastical minutae, gave lots of nods to fans of the comics while making a movie that is appealing to most.

The story concerns the two factions of the X-Men. X-Men are mutations from normal humans. One is lead by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the other by Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen). Xavier believes the X-Men can work with humans. Magneto wants to destroy humanity and in a brilliant opening scene (shot in black & white) set during the 2nd world war we see he has some justification for this view. Patrick Stewart and in particular Ian McKellan are the main reasons to see this film. They add a certain gravitas to the proceedings that takes the movie to a different level. Having said that Hugh Jackman and the rest of the cast are all good.

It always helps to have a good director and Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) does a great job. There are some excellent set pieces and the film is kept to a sensible length. This is well worth buying at the right price as it does hold up to repeated viewings.",1185667200,,1118,4.4754901960784315
1263656,4,B00003CX8I,"I bought this Steelbook Edition of this rare 1.5 version of X-Men at Best Buy where I believe was an exclusive. Just recently, I watched the DVD for the first time (I haven't seen any X-Men movies at this time). The movie in itself is a great film that will surely entertain everyone; including those who are not typically Sci-Fi fans such as myself. The movie left me very much looking forward to seeing the other two movies, but only after watching this one AGAIN first.

Three of us watched this film and we watched it in the enhanced mode where ""deleted scenes"" and ""behind the scenes looks"" were cut into the picture. I was expecting the scenes to just be added in clearly and cleanly like they were for Spider-Man 2.1, however they were not. The deleted scenes were located on another part of the DVD causing brupt pauses before and after each scene came on. With two discs, one would think they would have put the two versions of the movie in this collection in SEPERATE spaces for continuous playback with either version. However, they did not. (Note the regular version of the movie is continuous and uninterupted.) In the enhanced mode, there are ""X""s and ""/""s that appear on your screen when either a ""deleted scene"" or a ""behind the scenese look"" comes up during the movie. For this reason, my rating of the movie gets a 4 out of 5 stars.

This Steelbook Edition, along with the other nine Steelbooks that recently came out in June of 2007, is a reprint of the 2-Disc previously released edition of X-Men 1.5. There's nothing new about it, but it gives those who missed out on the opportunity to get the 1.5 version a second chance. Even with the pausing and cues that occur in the enhanced viewing mode of the extended version, the same format was copied from the first release; which was done before Spider-Man 2.1 came out (which may explain the better viewing of Spidey).

X-Men, as I said before, was a very good movie. I highly recommend this Steelbook to anyone who's a fan of X-Men. The bonus features are plentiful and will give fans even more enjoyment of this great film in a highly preservable packaging. I understand this is a rare and limited Steelbook, but if you can get it, I'm sure you'll be satisfied.",1182902400,2,2232,4.54726368159204
1263657,4,B00003CX8I,"The first X-Men film is not really perfect, but in terms of it's timing and what it meant might be coming down the pike with regards to cinematic interpretations of comic books (specifically Marvel comics) it is pretty darn close to perfect. Lets face it, this is the harbinger of the comic book movie age that has, like it or not, made some exciting and high-grossing films. I personally think the majority of comic book movies fail and could care less about how much money they make, but X-Men is a bit more than that. It's a very good movie too.

I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters but that actually served the film well in terms of how I viewed the hype. I didn't care because so many did...that's the old punk in me in guess. So I waited and received the film as an early Christmas gift the following year. I actually watched it Christmas eve and found it to be incredibly refreshing and enjoyable.

It begins by showing us a young boy being separated from his parents at a German concentration camp in Poland. His parents are going into the camp and will be killed. The boy is desperate to save them and as the German soldiers hold him down he reaches out and somehow begins to bend the metal gates that close in his parents before being struck down by the [...] of one of the soldiers' guns. The boy is Eric Lehnsherr, one of the great all-time Marvel comic villains known as Magneto. In one fell swoop, Bryan Singer does something that I've always been glad X-Men writers did consistently, and that is allow us to sympathize with this villain.

We are then introduced to the primary plot of a modern day Senator bent on the granting the government the ability to force registration of all mutants. Then it shows how telepathic and mind manipulating mutant Charles Xavier and his old friend and rival Magneto fundamentally disagree on how mutants as a race must react to this oncoming repression. This is followed by the introduction to our primary protagonists; Rogue, a young girl who drains the life of all people her skin makes contact with, and Wolverine, an enhanced mutant with the ability to heal himself enough that his body endured somking of skeletal replacement surgery. His skeleton is made of an indestructible metal and he also has claws made of this metal that break through his skin anytime he wants to kill someone. Great characters that Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman are able to portray well here. Again, Singer introduces these characters with relatable depth.

In short, Magneto wants to destroy humanity and the X-Men must stop him in an environment where they are not appreciated in the least by the public. Singer attempts to make sociological insights on those terms in addition to bringing great character depth. When you consider the number of characters and the length of the movie, these are not easy tasks to say the least. Then again, when watching the Usual Suspects it's quite obvious Singer has a knack for just this sort of thing.

X-Men is a very good movie but I won't give it five stars because it also contains some fairly annoying dialogue that I absolutely refuse to forgive. For example, the character Storm asks the villain Toad what happens when a toad is hit by lightning and answers her own question by saying ""the same as everything else."" It's not funny or witty. It serves no purpose other than to make Storm look like a big cheese ball, and that isn't really fair. Not to mention, who really cares what happens to a toad when it gets electrocuted and why is that even a question to begin with? Let's just watch the lightning bolt strike and see toad explode. That is really just a nit-picking though, as X-Men is still a very good movie and it actually gets more and more important in terms of movie history with time.",1180051200,4,3785,4.58493353028065
1263658,1,B00003CX8I,"First I should say that I have never read the comic books and rented this movie hoping it would be a fun adventure.

The concept is a good one.  I like the idea of mutants with different abilities banding together in different camps to harm or help the rest of humanity. Magneto has the possibility of being a sympathetic, realistic bad guy because of his past (shown at the beginning of the movie) experiences.

That is about all I can think of to say that's good.  The movie starts slow, with lots of exposition, when you are introduced to the characters, you are not given any reason to particularly care about them, and it doesn't get any better from there.  The bottom line is, the screenplay is terrible.  It drags, there is never really much of a sense of suspense, and the characters are not presented in a way that one can pull for them, with the possible exception of Patrick Stewart's character, but he isn't in most of the action scenes.  It's a shame, because with a great concept and some well-known actors, I would hope they would have better material to work with.

I can imagine that this movie would appeal to young people who enjoyed the comic books and already like the characters and world.

That it has a long life and can still be enjoyed years after it's release, and X-Men definitely fits that category. But, what is not to like about this movie?

The casting for it is perfect, Ian McKellen makes a great Magneto and Patrick Stewart makes a perfect Professor Charles Xavier. The same things can be said for everyone in the movie and who they were cast as in the film. It is done so perfectly, it adds to the story and makes me wonder if this movie would have been as powerful as it is if other people were cast in this film. Let's not forget the special effects that are used in this movie. That is definitely eye candy for sure. The mutant powers look great when they are used in this movie and look realistic. It is really cool to see Wolverine's adamantium claws first slowly come out in the bar.

The story doesn't follow the comics as well as I had hoped they would. The biggest example I could see in the film is that Wolverine and Sabertooth don't know each other prior to their meeting in this movie, but in the comic, they have known each other for years. Despite the lack of being 100% like the comic, this movie makes a story of it's own and the previous story isn't really needed. It is so compelling in the way it is told, it can be forgiven for its very small mistakes for sure. This is definitely a have to see movie. If you haven't by now, you need to!",1165881600,,1592,4.182410423452769
1263664,5,B00003CX8I,"I saw a picture on a TV guide (I believe) in 2000, with a picture of a man with three blades coming out of his hand.  At first, I thought it was an ad for the newest Nightmare On Elm Street installment, until I noticed that it was Hugh Jackman in the upcoming movie ""The X-Men"".  My mind gave the famous line of Emily Litella:  ""Well, that makes it completely different.  Never mind.""  After all, I had read and loved the X-Men comics when I was younger, and knew enough to know that Jackman was playing the Wolverine.

This movie was as good as I could imagine it, and even better.  It had the special effects and action you would expect in a comic book adaptation.  But the movie appealed to the mind as much as to the eyes and nerves.

This movie (and actually, the whole series) deals with the issue of prejudice and how to deal with it.  In these movies, it is mutants that are the victims of this prejudice.  The story line says it is a spurt of evolution; there is nothing to scientifically verify this.  Nevertheless, the mutants are feared and persecuted.

There are mutant protagonists, led by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and mutant antagonists, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen).  The difference between them is the response to the persecution.  The protagonists seek to live quietly and peaceably with humans, having Xavier's school as a place for protection and refuge.  The antagonists are ready to wage war with the persecutors.

In this first installment, Magneto's goal is to transform humans into mutants, which he does to a Senator who wants to have mutants registered (not unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany, a comparison made in the first scene of the movie).  The problem is that humans are unable to withstand the change and end up dying.

I avoid detailed plot descriptions in my reviews so I spoil as few surprises as possible.  I will say, though, that Magneto survives the first movie, not unlike Darth Vader surviving in the Star Wars movies.  One thing I like about the movie, though, is that Magneto is not the type of villain you want to see killed.  Magneto and Xavier are not true enemies, but adversaries who would admit the other is really a friend.  I am the type of person who would rather see a villain reformed than executed.

This movie is PG-13.  The Senator's death, among other scenes, keep this from being a family movie.  However, I have no problem with teenagers seeing this movie.",1164499200,4,2426,4.596736596736597

And Wolverine, one of the most popular and awesome superheroes of all time, gets played by someone PERFECT for the role... Hugh Jackman!  Come to think of it, I have no complaints regarding the entire cast selection.  If you like superheroes and action movies, you owe it to yourself to watch X-Men.

Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!

1263718,4,B00003CX8I,"I remember watching the X-men cartoon as a child. When I was twelve the first X-men movie came out. It was exciting to see all of the characters I had seen come alive. The basic plot of X-Men is simple. The general public is concerned about the mutant population. They suggest a mutant registration act, which would require all mutants to come forward and reveal themselves and their abilities. One mutant sees this as a threat, Magneto ( played very coldly as the the villian you love to hate by Sir Ian McKellen). He believes in a world where mutants are superior and are the next stage in evolution. Magneto long time friend Charles Xavier( played by Patrick Stewart) believes in a world where mutants and humans can live peacefully. Xavier runs a school that is a safe have for mutants. He has a team he has trained known as the X-Men, who are battling against Magneto and his schemes of world domination. It is an incredible movie, which was followed by two movies that were stellar. The cast is also joined by Famke Janseen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, and the marvelous Hugh Jackman. This is a timeless movie which will always have a special place in my life.",1150934400,,1166,4.583732057416268

1263720,5,B00003CX8I,"This was an extraordinary movie. It shows you the mutants that were created after a war filled with such hate and horror. There are two sets of X-MEN types, or as we would say MUTANTS. The X-Men are the good guys. They help save the world by fighting the others. Not unlike the Lost, there are two sets of Mutants, but our X-Men which are some of the best work I have seen, as far as the way they are made up and shown to us, shows some of the most colorful Mutants that ever were. This movie is not your typical movie of Sci-fi. This has great plots, and great good guys to protect the innocent. They are hunted down, yet their friends are always there to take them all in. There are 2 other sequels, one just coming into the theatre soon. But you must see this movie and I suggest all the others as well. It has creativity, suspense, and it is a wee bit scary. But once you get to know the MUTANTS, the good ones, you too will love all of them. I adore these films. They happen to be a work of art,",1149206400,,1000,4.030150753768845
1263721,4,B00003CX8I,"Even when I was really into comics more than a few years ago, the X-Men just never really appealed to me.  Maybe it was the fact that I really didn't know the story behind each character; that was certainly one of the issues I had with this film.  Granted, my encounters with the X-Men have been few and far between, but I've just never seen much of anything behind any of the characters other than Dr. Charles Xavier and Wolverine.  I followed Wolverine during the first couple of years of his first solo comic, largely because he was a complicated, mysterious, deadly character with great depth and passion, a man still trying to discover what he truly was.  Despite his mutant powers, Wolverine always comes across as a human being, with all the positives and negatives that implies.  Without him, I can't connect with any of the other mutants, so I think the filmmakers definitely had the right idea when they used Wolverine as their cinematic conduit to the viewing public.

This is a rather unusual film, in that it was obviously written with sequels in mind - there's not a very big sense of completion to this film at all.  Not only does it refrain from supplying some important answers, it doesn't even get around to asking all of the questions yet.  The first half of the movie basically serves to introduce us to all the major players.  Even still, I feel like I know next to nothing about Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden); in actuality, I can't work up much of a reason to even care about those two very much.  I have to wonder, though, if Cyclops is supposed to be so annoyingly prissy; Marsden seems to be channeling a Footloose-era Tom Cruise, which made it impossible for me to like his character.  I can't complain about the two heavyweights in this particular arena, though.  Patrick Stewart adds an important air of believability to a story that could have easily stumbled down the road toward campiness, while Ian McKellan - a rather surprising choice to play Magneto, I feel - actually brings gravitas to a role that seems quite beneath him.  The special effects are quite impressive, and the story is interesting enough, but I'm not sure this film would have worked without Stewart and McKellan.

As I mentioned earlier, I tend to look upon this (for the most part) as Wolverine's movie.  Hugh Jackman pretty much nails his character, in terms of both the look and the attitude.  Despite his personal preference for solitude, Wolverine's the one who helps Rogue out when she's trying to find her bearings; most of what we learn about Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) and Cyclops are a direct result of the connection he makes with Grey; he is the one who draws the most important information out of Dr. Xavier, etc.  The movie doesn't really bring this out, but Wolverine also has a special rivalry with Sabretooth (Tyler Mane, who doesn't do the character a whole lot of justice to my eyes).

In terms of the plot, you basically watch Logan and Rogue slowly make a place for themselves among the X-Men, eventually coming together with Grey, Cyclops, and Storm to prevent Xavier's old, wayward buddy Magneto from succeeding in his dastardly plan to establish the dominance of mutants over human society - even if it means inciting a war between humans and mutants.  Honestly, it isn't the most impressive script I've ever seen, basically putting the ultimate fate of the film in the hands of the actors and actresses bringing the story to life.  Some darn good casting really saved the day here.",1148601600,10,3529,4.6980519480519485
1263722,2,B00003CX8I,"Hollywood made a good attempt. As both an X-men fan and an actor, I can understand complaints from both sides.

The critic in me sees how characters were introduced in the wrong order (Beast and Angel came way before Wolverine or Storm). Some were even missing, such as Gambit. And then Toad and Sabretooth were killed, leaving Magneto with just Mystique.

The actor in me understands how expensive it can get to travel all over, hosting auditions and gathering so many people together for a film, including big names that bring star-power to it: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Barry, etc.

In the end, I feel the story of the X-men has been around far too long to be done in an incomplete manner.",1148601600,2,703,4.653225806451613

1263788,5,B00003CX8I,"Humanity is at a crossroads. Evolution has reared its head. There are human beings in the world today with extraordinary gifts and powers. These powerful beings are called ""mutants."" And their existence scares some people.

In the United States, Senator Robert Kelly has introduced legislation that will require all mutants to ""register"" as such. He feeds the fear by telling his peers, and the public, some of what he's heard these mutants can do.

Two of the most powerful mutants, Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X), and his old friend, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto), have different agendas of how best to deal with humanity's intolerance of mutants.

The Professor believes that patience is a virtue in this case. Humanity will come around eventually, he believes. In the meantime, he has established a ""School for the Gifted,"" where he teaches his students how to control and master their powers for the good of humanity.

Magneto, on the other hand, believes that a war between humans and mutants is inevitable. Instead of waiting for it to happen, however, he wants to go on the offensive. If it's a war humans want, it's a war they will get. One way or the other, Magneto will see to it that the mutant race is the only race that survives.

That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know before going to see this movie, though you could really no nothing at all and not have to worry. ""X-Men"" does an excellent job of setting the stage for those viewers who no nothing of the world of mutants.

The X-Men universe has been around for a very long time, with several incarnations in both the comic book and cartoon series world. Each incarnation has its own version of the struggle between humanity and mutants, as well as its own telling of the backgrounds of the characters. There is a very rich history to draw from, with a possible cast of hundreds of mutants to draw from.

One of the reasons I liked this movie so much is that director Bryan Singer didn't try to introduce too many mutants all at once. Although long-time mutant lovers would have loved it, novice mutant viewers would have been too overwhelmed to follow the story. Instead, the main storyline was limited to just a handful of mutants (Professor X, Magneto, Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Sabertooth, Toad, and Mystique). However, he also treated long time X-Men fans to a glimpse of many other mutant favorites (including Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, and Kitty to name a few).

I also thought the casting of this movie was near perfection. Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) made such a great Professor X that you almost begin to think that the comic book character was originally written with him in mind. Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) as Magneto was also a great choice. Fanke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) were also very well choices.

However, my favorite casting decision has got to be Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I don't know who it was that saw the potential he had to play this part, but it was very much the right call. Of all the characters, the casting of Wolverine is the one that could have broken the entire movie for long time X-Men fans. Thankfully, Jackman was the perfect choice and we were treated to a great portrayal.

I know some long time X-Men fans were disappointment that his or her favorite mutant did not make it into the movie. However, there is great potential for not only more X-Men movies (at the time of this review, X2: X-Men United has already been released and pre-production work is currently in progress for X-Men 3), but also for more specialized mutant movies focusing on one, two, or three mutants at a time (right now, rumors are circulating about a movie featuring Wolverine and one featuring Storm). If done correctly, this franchise can last for many, many years.

The original VHS version also comes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards.

Boiled down: ""X-Men"" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun. I truly recommend that you add this to your movie collection.",1103846400,8,4201,4.7554945054945055

  A lot of this can be blamed on the writing. Rouge has no history with Mystique and Wolverine has no history with Sabertooth. Even worse than that is the relationship with Rouge and Iceman.

1263852,1,B00003CX8I,"First off, I'm not going to say anything about the quality of the video or anything, because I'm not concerned with things like that.
I got X-Men and X-Men2, along with another movie, at a Used Sale, all for about $10. I had never seen any of these movies, and, as a fan of the recent animated series, X-Men Evolution, I decided to give the movies a try.
And maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought that they were both horrific movies. The acting was okay. Hugh Jackman was an excellent choice for Wolverine, and he did a nice job. Ian McKellen also did very well as Magneto, I think. The rest of the acting was mediocre to upsetting.
Not only that, the characters barely had any personality. All the viewer knows about Jean Grey is that she's smart and pretty and nice. Scott Summers (Cyclopes) loves Jean. (That's really the only emotion that he is allowed to show.) Rogue is a little girl frightened of her powers. Logan (Wolverine) is a tough cookie. Everything the movie tells us about them is just simple, stereotypical, on-the-surface facts. The characters have no individual personality. They all seem to have the same sense of humor, say the same things... blah blah blah. So the script was terrible.
The one thing I can give you is that the story was great, but credit to that goes to the comic. So. I'll have to take that compliment back. There was absolutely nothing good about this movie.

The director expertly showcases the X-Universe, setting the mood and tone for the sequels to come.
Although this is sci-fi material, in a way it`s depicted in a realistic, believable manner, as the characters and their envoironment seem credible and not too fantasy-like creations. Singer developed a serious tone for this universe, avoiding the childish and irritating tendencies of the latter Batman movies. The plot focuses mainly on Wolverine and Rogue, so unfortunately the rest of the characters aren`t too developed, but given that this is the first movie of a series it works well enough.
""X-Men"" is intelligent, creative sci-fi, a solid movie with good direction, competent special effect (used just when necessary, avoiding useless explosions and fights), an efficient plot and a talented cast. Not a masterpiece, just a good comic-book adaptation (in fact, it`s probably one of the best).
The ending result should please fans and non-fans alike, altough it would be surpassed by its sequel, ""X2"", a better and more sucessful movie. Worthwile entertainment (and though-provoking, too).",1075680000,,1475,5.530973451327434
1263857,4,B00003CX8I,"X-Men was a great movie in my mind.  It may not have followed the comic completely, but people have to realize that is going to happen when you have hundreds of individual X-Men titles and only a two hour movie.  I do not care that Angel and Beast where not in the movie, or that Iceman was just a kid.  The only characters I missed were Gambit and Psylocke.  Wolverine is the most popular X-Men character, which makes sense why the film (and the second one) revolves around him, but I think they did a great job in making all of the other characters individuals as well, and not just there.  And for all the people who disagreed with Ian McKellan as Magneto I just have to say that I too did not think it was a good casting choice to begin with, but I quickly changed my mind upon seeing the movie.  McKellan is a superb Magneto.  For those who complained that he was too old, do not forget that Magneto was a teenager during World War II back in the early 1940s.  He WOULD be in his late 60s early 70s at this point (McKellan himself is 64 and was born in 1939, the year the war BEGAN).  Do not be led astray by Magneto's youthful appearance in the comics.  He is an old man.
  In close I just have to say that the best is yet to come in the X-Men world.  As cool as I think Magneto is, I believe the better X-Men villains, Mr. Sinister and Apocalypse, will make for an even better movie.",1068508800,,1390,4.122676579925651

  In this,the villian is magneto,who has the power of moving and bending metal and this is a big problem for wolverine. He is another mutant that has the power of healing and his bones are made of a hard metal. Actually,this metal did not form his bones from the start but an experiment created it.
  Logan(wolverine)soon meets the leader of a team of mutants who wants to help him. His name is Charles Xavier and he is a very strong telepath. The other mutants are Cyclops,Jean,Storm and Rogue. The partners of Magneto are Toad Sabertooth and Mystique.

1263910,4,B00003CX8I,"--The Setting--
The not-to-distant present. The human race is feeling threatened (perhaps by not having a cold war with a ready-made enemy to vilify) by a new phenomenon - mutant people who possess strange abilities. Are they defects and deformed people? Are they the next step in evolution? Whatever they are (hence the X term), they are a worry to many, particular the senator calling for their registration (a recurrent theme in American sociology - let's register those different from us; let's register known communists, let's register all gun owners, let's register all sex offenders, let's register, hmmm, what's left?).

Some of the X people (sorry, the title is gender-inaccurate: not all of the X-men are men) see this as the first step to their imprisonment and irradication, particularly the one named Magneto, who watched his family being herded toward death chambers in Nazi Germany (where they also had a penchant for registration). Magneto decides that this is the final straw, and vows to 'change the minds' of the leaders of the world.

On the side of the angels is Xavier, Professor Charles Xavier, powerful telepath, who is both a champion of mutant rights but also a believer in the fundamental goodness of humanity. Thus, we have the classic battle - good and evil. The battle lines are drawn. The forces line up.

Behind Magneto, who can control metal objects, either believing in his vision of a corrupt humanity who will do them no good, or simply after the power their powers could afford them, are Toad, a mutant spits toxic goop with his rubbery tongue, Mystique, a basic shape-shifter, and Sabretooth, the 'muscle' every villain.

In league with Xavier at his school are Cyclops, a man whose eyes fire laser beams, Storm, who can control the weather, and Jean Grey, who possesses minor telepathic powers and telekinetic abilities.

Into the midst of this gathering battle fall Wolverine, a man with heightened senses, quick healing and special implants of metal, and Rogue, a frightened teenaged girl whose touch robs the one she's touching of his or her life force.

--The Story--
Good versus evil. Who's side are you on? Wolverine and Rogue are nearly abducted by Magneto's forces, saved by Xavier's forces, then (of course) caught once again. There are some clever moments and diversions (what is really going on?), but mostly as a movie inspired by a comic book would be, the plot is predictable. Magneto is out to convince the world leaders that they are wrong to despise and fear the mutants by turning them into mutants. Each of the mutants has a reason to opt for one side or the other in this battle. Each of the X-people have a past, and we get only teasing glimpses of some of them. The good guys win, of course, but it isn't a definitive victory. Of course, you wouldn't expect it to be. This is supposed to be a blockbuster that will spawn sequels for years to come...Overall, this was a fun movie with a good action, a good story, and good effects. I must confess to never having seen the comic books before and being completely ignorant about the characters or plots, so there were no expectations to be dashed. Stewart and McKellen are two of my favourite actors, and they did not disappoint in their roles.

My one wish would have been for more background and details - I know they were hoping to leave something for the sequels, but coming in at just over 90 minutes, they surely could have let those of us without a comic book interest in on a little more of the mystery.",1058745600,,3519,4.7495908346972175
1263911,4,B00003CX8I,"I think that this movie should be seen as an introduction to a series. People have to understand that with these super-hero movies, the sequels will always top the originals. The first will always be about introducing the story, which i think X-Men did very well while still maintaining a good plot. Overall this was a good movie. It could have been better, and at the same time it could have been much worse.",1055894400,,409,4.54054054054054

X-Men as a movie though was pretty good, it had sweet special effects and brought a lot of the core X-Men characters to life. The DVD was also an evolution of sorts, released with a slew of special features and a nice foil cardboard case, it was a pretty little package. It became a birthday, christmas and easter gift godsend for children and comic fans alike. I also recommend the new X-Men 1.5 DVD, it surpasses this one easily. But the X-Men DVD's both deserve about 4 out of 5 stars. Great films with great marketing.",1055548800,,704,4.340909090909091

1263914,3,B00003CX8I,"The focus on the not so surreal characteristics here are so much better than the far fetched comic book interpritations of them. And nobody could have better suited Wolverine than Hugh Jackman. THe best choice a movie has made for casting in such a long time. Patrick Stewart as the intellectually skilled Dr Xavier was also a wise choice. After watching the gripping start of Magneto's cause of anger (his brush with horrors of Nazi torture camps), the movie does give us a neat set of beginnings. Some disapointments - the superpowerhouse Sabertooth, unfortunately is underused here. Just a throw and punch here, and a quick fight near the end doesn't justify the character you are ready for. Toad and Mystique, who are as neat, have too much fun instead.
Ian McKellan steals a few scenes as the self righteous yet genius Magneto, the leader of the bad guys.
Halle Berry is not bad as storm, or Famke Jannsen as the budding telekenetic Jean Grey. Nice to see a Mutant superhero have a twist: She is still learning to harness her abilities.
Very underused is Cyclops. A smooth performance by James Marsden, the young yet dilligent leader of Xaviers' squad.
THe effects and enviromnents are a smash. THe plot to change ordinary humans into mutatnts is neat, and no big deal. Just another mad chararters going to dominate the world thing. Still, it was fun. Oh, the mutants didn't have enough time to duke it out. Way too little time.",1053388800,,1433,4.736
1263915,3,B00003CX8I,"The ""X-Men"" movie had to make a lot of changes from the comic book to make it more acceptable to the general public.  In the orginal comic book, the X-men get their powers, because their parents were exposed to atomic raditation.  For example, Sunfire became a superpowered mutant because his mother was in Hiroshima when the bomb went off.  Soon after she gave birth to Sunfire, and then she died.  In contrast; the movie ""The Conqueror"" (1956), starring John Wayne, was filmed downwind of above ground atomic tests in Nevada and Utah.  About 70% of the people associated with this movie died of cancer.  There were no reports of superpowered mutant children being born afterwards.  Also, Mystique was an enemy of Ms. Mar-vel.  Mystigue tried to kill Ms. Mar-vel, then she murdered Dr. Michael Barrett, a friend of Ms. Mar-vel.  Then Rogue, an ally of Mystique tried to murder Ms. Mar-vel and in the process Rogue gained Ms. Mar-vel's super powered ablities.  Carol Danvers, (Ms. Mar-vel),  survived to become Binary and then Warbird.  Rogue left Mystique, because Ms. Mar-vel's memories were overwhelming her, and then she went to the X-Men seeking help for her condition.  In the movie, the X-Men get their powers from their genes, not from raditation, and there is no metion of Sunfire or Ms. Mar-vel.  Rogue and Mystique have no prior relationship with one another in the movie.  As far as the movie goes, it tries to compare prejudice between regular humans, and superpowered mutants to other types of racism based on skin color, or religion, and I feel that is overreaching. The film has a scene set at a WWII death camp and I think that including it was tasteless in the extreme.  Most Marvel comic books are set in New York City; will we get a Marvel superpowered person movie that includes scenes of 9-11-01 in it?  I hope not!  The film is okay as far as acting, photography, dialoge, and special effects for a movie based on a comic book, but, I wish Patrick Stewart and most of the others could find a film more worthy of their obvious talents.  In comparison to other comic book movies; ""Superman I"" and ""II"" were the best, followed by the ""Batman"" movies with Michael Keaton, then ""Spiderman"" with Toby McGuire, and ""X-Men"".  I did not see ""Daredevil"" with Ben Affeck, about a totally BLIND superhero!  I do recommend ""X-Men"" as it is a good, not great film.",1051833600,,2373,4.7250608272506085
1263916,2,B00003CX8I,"X-men had hardly ANY action. It was 95% dialougue. I grew up watching X-MEN, and this movie felt more like a prequel in all-out character development than anything else. All this movie involved ... was side-story after side-story, explanations for the X-men. Since there are so many X-men, you've gotta obviously establish characters, but this movie NEEDED more action! Also, that one-liner by Storm toward the end, about what happens to a toad when he gets struck by lightning??, was just terrible and cheesy! If a piece of wood gets struck, it won't get electrocuted, give me a break! Besides those mindless flaws, Wolverine hardly faught in the whole movie! What happened to his killer-instict animal-violent persona?! We didn't see any of that until the end, which by that point was too lacking a climax to really ENJOY more than we could have!
Also, X-MEN 2 looks to be so much better in the action, visual department. But they really SHOULD involve GAMBIT and BEAST in the third X-MEN, that is if they do want to bring absolute, true justice to world-wide fans, and the actual comic-story before Hollywood got involved. I also miss the cool, yellow and black custome that Wolverine used to wear in the comic book and TV series. That would be awesome if they had him switch into something more wicked cool instead of this leather, plastic-looking jump-suit night-gear.
In conclusion, the first one was just boring, especially coming from the guy who directed USUAL SUSPECTS. The original X-men truly NEEDED much more action and they also needed better, more wild, (maybe more violent) and especially creative FIGHT SEQUENCES! The first X-Men was just weak, even though it did a good job at establishing who was who in the group. Even still, it was not really something I could sit through again, as it almost ... due to lack of almost any ACTION. Something for the director and writers to acknowledge if they care about the... um, triology? But I think X-Men 2 does address some of these issues just by looking at the previews. It would be nice to know someone will address the other as well.",1051747200,,2097,4.795580110497237
1263917,3,B00003CX8I,"I remember walking about of the theatre the first time I saw this movie. The first thing that came to my mind was ""Wow! The sequels are going to be awesome!"" A lot like how the Empire Strikes Back was an alright movie, but let's face it, it was really just a long hype up for Return of the Jedi.
While being a great movie, X-Men has the problem many movies have. A great story with a lot of things left out, unexplained, or that could have been fixed. I never read the comic books growing up, but listening to my friends who did, I had enough knowledge to wonder why they never covered Storm's claustraphobia when she was in the elevator shaft, or why Rogue was so young.
Then there's Halle Berry for Storm. I know, ""she's sooooo hot!!"" But she's not that great of an actor in this movie. Expecially when you give her an accent. She looks the part, but the director needed to work with her some more. Expecially when it comes to her lines. I've never met anyone who's disagreed that her line to Toad when she fries him has to be one of the dumbest lines in movie history. And when they were trying to save Rogue, why couldn't she fly up to her? SHE CAN FLY!! Perhaps I just had a problem with her portrayal of Storm.  I'm used to the bold...Storm and not one that looks scared or sad all the time.
As other have said, Sabertooth was a [softy.]And Toad!? He's the dumbest villian in the whole series. At least they got him out of the way early.
Finally there's Jean Grey. Great role, but needed a hotter actress. Not to be picky, but I HAVE seen how she's drawn in the comics. They just didn't portray her well enough.
But now that that's all out of my system, I will say that the rest of the movie was great. It made me quite excited for the sequel. Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine.  Before I saw the movie I thought the biggest challenge would be making Wolverine's hair look normal.  And no one other than Patrick Stewart would work for Professior X.
Again, this is a great movie with a few flaws.  Perhaps they'll fix all them in the sequel knowing people will go see it.
As for me, I feel like such a nerd...I'm gonna go shower. I feel dirty.",1051574400,,2151,4.226277372262774
1263948,4,B00003CX8I,"As most of the world knows by now, X-Men is the live-action version of the of the Marvel comic strip, directed by Bryan Singer (of the Usual Suspects fame). Set in the not too distant future the X-Men are humans who thanks to genetic mutation have inherited special powers. On the surface, having special powers sounds great (you might think) but in X-Men the mutant race is an oppressed and persecuted minority, due to the bigotry, ignorance and fear of much of the non-mutant population. Furthermore an ambitious and influential Senator (Bruce Davison) wants to introduce a registration policy for mutants in an attempt to further restrict their civil rights. In response to this the mutant community is split into two camps led by Professor X, aka Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto, aka Erik Mangus Lensherr (Sir Ian McKellen). Magneto believes in the supremacy of the mutant population, which he is willing to use force to prove, whilst Professor X merely wants, equality, integration and peace. With fundamentally opposing views the two camps are set on a collision course with the future of the human race at stake.
X-Men is an entertaining action movie and it has some great fight scenes but it is pitched at its intended mass audience and carefully falls short explicit violence making it pretty much suitable for all but young children. However, although the X Men movie comes from a comic book background and is definitely aimed at a mass audience it also has a message and is a lot more highbrow than most super hero adaptations. X-Men for example opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp with a young Magneto witnessing his mother being shepherded off to the gas chamber and from this it is pretty clear that Director Bryan Singer is deliberately making a point and drawing a comparison. It is also worth noting that at the time of the X Men's creation, back in 1963, among the major political figures in pre civil rights America were Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and it is easy to draw comparisons with Professor X and Magneto. Comparisons can also be drawn between X-Men character Senator Robert Kelly and a certain Senator McCarthy. What is more, X-Men is particularly pertinent at a time when there is so much tabloid speculation and scare mongering with regard to genetic engineering.
With X-Men, Director Bryan Singer, a self-confessed fan, has stayed remarkably loyal to the comic books and has served up a commercial but extremely enjoyable film with impressive special effects, which has inevitably spawned a sequel and (in all likelihood) a franchise, which makes me for one very happy. Full of great characters and great performances from the likes of Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine), Anna Pacquin (as Rogue) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey) and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique). However, it is the excellent pairing of the Royal Shakespeare company's McKellen and Stewart opposite each other that really adds gravitas to the proceedings and my only real dissapointments were seeing the excellent and beautiful Halle Berry (as Storm) being under-used and the relatively short running length of 97 minutes.
X-Men 2 hits our screens later this year and I for one am really looking forward to it! Four stars ****",1051056000,15,3256,4.954296160877513
1263949,5,B00003CX8I,"We all must realize that had this movie flopped, it is possible that there would not have been a ""Spiderman"", ""Daredevil"", or the terrific-looking (at least from the previews) ""X2"".  While many comic fans are rejoicing that the future looks great for this type of picture, there had to be a tremendous amount of pressure to do it right.  After years of seeing substandard products, due to a combination of lack of special effects technology or Hollywood indifference, the folks at Marvel waited many years for the right time to put together exactly the right movie.
After living with these characters for many years and having it firmly in my mind what they should look like, I can say that there could not have been a better job of casting.  Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X.  Getting a actor of Ian McKellen's status for Magneto was a real coup.  Hugh Jackman gives the best performance in the highly desired role of Wolverine.  Who knew then that Halle Berry would become the second Oscar-winning actress in the cast (along with Anna Paquin)?  And who also knew then that Rebecca Romjin-Stammos would become arguably modeldom's hottest pin-up?
All these people were cast by others that knew the characters inside and out, and wanted the best product possible.  Like ""Spiderman"", there are very few changes to the ""rules"" of the characters, and anything done different (like ditching the familiar costumes) was done without harming a thing.  Watching it again is getting me really pumped up for the sequel.",1050883200,6,1520,4.883268482490273
1263950,4,B00003CX8I,"When the announcement came that a film was going to be made about the X-Men, after Marvel sold the rights, I wasn't too happy with the news. Previous films based on comic books did not do that well. Judge Dread and Spawn are just two examples. I didn't expect much from the film but when I heard that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen where going to play two of the main characters I was lifted and I thought the film might not be so bad after all.

When I went to see this at the cinema I was surprised with the film in whole and with individual items. In whole the plot of the film is good and the way the film unfolds as to who Magneto (Ian McKellen) really wants is done in such a way as to mislead you to who he really wants until the X-Men finally find out what his intentions are. Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is played very well and the fear that he, and many others, feel about mutants. The argument that takes place near the beginning of the film with Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is very well directed and the argument is a valid one as well, making good points and the points being made all making sense.
In the individual parts of the film the characters stay true to there characters in the comic books apart from the fact that the X-Men now wear uniforms instead of ""yellow spandex!"" The actors are well chosen and seeing as though I haven't seen many of the actors in any other films they really did bring the characters themselves come to life. Rebecca Romijn- Stamos who played Mystique had to spend 10 hours in make-up just to look the part! Everything that takes place in the film that is related to the X-Men stay true to the comic. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), better know as Professor X has a school set up for ""gifted"" people where other mutants teach them how to control their powers and also get a education while being in a safe environment. Professor X himself being a mutant who broke his back and is now confined to a wheelchair. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is one of the most favourite characters out of the X-Men (not forgetting Cyclops (James Marsden) and his character features a lot in the film. His past is unknown and the reason why he has a super strong metal, known as adamantium, which gives him the ability to extend and retract steel claws from between his knuckles is implanted though out his body is a mystery and leaves the story open for a sequel.....
All the actors who played all the main characters in the film also deserve praise as they played the characters well and they did truly represent the characters from the comic book.
The DVD of the X-men includes a number of ""extras"" as well as the original and an extended version. Don't expect much from the extended version of the X-Men as it is not a complete individual film itself. It takes the original film and when extra pieces of the film, that were removed or deleted from the film for a number of reasons, are just inserted into the film. This means that you get a rough version where you sometimes have to watch parts of the film that doesn't really fit in well or have to watch the same part of the film twice but with different scripts. I suggest you watch the original version first before you watch the extended version so you don't get confused. The DVD also includes interviews with the Bryan Singer who directed the film, the screen test for Wolverine (why!?!), all the adverts from the USA and the UK that appeared on the TV advertising the film at the cinema, the advert for the soundtrack, the animation test for two parts of the film, a gallery section (and for those who have a Playstation 2 you will need a hand control to view these) and a little section called ""Mutant Watch""
Mutant Watch is really good. It is about 20 minutes long and it shows an separate version of the court case where Senator Kelly argues his case about mutants and has video evidence which are parts of the film. This section is acted out specifically for DVD and it is a clever way to advertise the X-Men film while also explaining some parts of the film to those who don't know, don't understand or are unfamiliar with the X-Men world.
Anyway this film is good for die hard fans or new comers and it is a DVD I strongly suggest you buy or at least rent.",1049068800,2,4265,4.38510101010101
1263951,4,B00003CX8I,"With the second X-Men movie rolling out this summer, I decided that it would be a good time to get off my backside and watch the first. What I found was a very enjoyable action movie, with more brains than one usually finds in that genre, with a good cast and excellent direction. If the sequel is this good, then it will definitely be worth watching.
In recent years, an increasing number of people have been discovered to be mutants, whose DNA has taken a leap forward and given them superhuman powers. Now their freedom is threatened. Rogue, a girl whose touch can kill (Anna Paquin) and Logan/Wolverine, (Hugh Jackman) a man with steel claws and amazing regenerative abilities are attacked in Canada, only to be rescued by mutants and taken to a top-secret ""school for the gifted"" in New York. It's run by the mind-reading/controlling mutant Carles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), to teach and protect his fellow mutants, known as X-Men.
But there are others without such benevolent plans. Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor who can generate powerful magnetic fields, anticipates a coming war between mutants and ordinary humans. With the help of the reptilian shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), savage Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), and nasty Toad (Ray Park), he abducts and artificially mutates a U.S. senator, then threatens the entire population of New York with a bizarre weapon. And only the X-Men can hope to stop him.
Yes, it sounds cheesy, but it's done well. In fact, most of the movie goes under the listing of sounds-stupid-but-is-done-well. The superpower-enhanced action sequences are well done, and the mutants are given human edges and attachments that keep them from just being pretty faces with superpowers. They may not be homo sapiens any longer, but in personality they are quite human. The special effects are surprisingly muted, and usually kept in tune with the storyline. Though this is an action movie, it bothers to have a complicated plotline including politics, history, and a bit of commentary on intolerance and mindless prejudice as well.
Patrick Stewart does a good job as a benevolent father-figure to all the mutants (they're even referred to as his ""children"" in one scene). Ian McKellen is flawless as Magneto; this is not some random wanna-conquer-the-world villain, but someone who is embittered and determined to the point of potential genocide. (An interesting parallel is that he is a survivor of the Holocaust, yet he seeks to establish a ""master race"" of mutants) Hugh Jackman does a good job with Wolverine's tough-guy image that covers his confusion and loneliness, since he doesn't know who he is or who put metal all over his bones. Anna Paquin annoyed me as Rogue, because she seems to cry a lot. Famke Janssen (as telekinetic Jean Grey), Halle Berry (as weather-controlling Storm), and James Marsden (as laser-eyed Cyclops) are all good supporting roles, although Berry's role is somewhat thinner than her costars'.
This movie is also a bit darker than films like Spiderman, more adult and more disturbing (especially with the themes about prejudice and discrimination). This movie isn't quite flawless, unfortunately. Some of the costumes are a bit overdone, especially Storm's -- is there any logical reason for her to wear that silver catsuit and cape? Most of the characters are fine, like Cyclops and Wolverine, but occasionally the costumes get a little silly. Additionally, many of the scientific aspects of the movie are never explained at all, such as Kelly's transformation into the human jellyfish. How exactly does Magneto do this? I'm a little fuzzy on how that radiation is generated and how it affects ordinary humans.

Two, Storm could've had more than 3 lines.  The plot of Magneto wanting to take over the world is fine but U wasn't that impressed with the movie.  Why?  In a way I think that animation or heavy special effects beyond a reasonable budget would make these films better.  The Matrix kind of has taken a monopoly on ways to demonstrate superhuman abilities and lo and behold this summer they'll be in direct competition.

In the comics the X-men had tight, character driven stories, the screenplay for this movie is juat a bunch of jumbled scenes thrown together. While there are some good casting moves (Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian Mckellen are wonderful in their roles) we rarely get to see ANY OF THE CAST DO ANYTHING  EXCEPT pot and spout cliches with the exception of Hugh Jackman who gets way too much screen time. Characters we've all grown to care about-Cyclops(underused), Storm(who has an on again off again African accent), Rogue(too young) and Jean Grey(wooden) have nonexistent roles. The villans are also pretty useless in this movie too. Mystique has no story, sabretooth no personality and toad is just a spit and tongue gimmick. The years of depth and caracter development of the comic characters are sacrificed for the sake of idiotic stunts and special effects.

1263956,5,B00003CX8I,"The first in a possibly long ""X-Men"" movie franchise is a great but flawed movie and it is one of the one of my favorite movies of 2000.
It starts with a young teenage boy by the name of Eric Lensherr who struggles against the Nazi during WWII and his powers manifest for the first time in his life when he manages to warp and damage a gate to a concentration camp before being knocked unconscious. It is not seen however but Lensherr escapes however and would eventually meet Charles Xavier. Their friendship would eventually continue sort of in a way but at the same time, it would turn into a bitter rivalry as prejudice against mutants worsens and worsens and Xavier seeks to mend the rift between normal humans and mutants while Lensherr on the other hand, believing that humans will never accept mutants into their society, seeks to wage an all-out war against them and rid the world of them. In this flick, Magneto has plotted a special machine that irradiates a force field that mutates normal human cells and the normal human body rejects the mutations and dissolves into water while mutants are completely unscathed. Also, Wolverine escapes a military testing compound with little or no memory of his time there.
The cast of the film is hit and miss, not by the actors themselves but simply how some of them act out their character roles.
The best ones for their characters are Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, and Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto.  Hugh Jackman has the right kind of expressions that would remind one of Wolverine from the 1992-1996 cartoon series. Patrick Stewert does a wonderful job playing Xavier, I would even go far as to say that Stewert IS Charles Xavier. Sir Ian McKellan cannot be outdone playing the master of magnetism Magneto and has the right kind of sinister voice that would definitely scare young kids. All three of these actors give solid performances and they alone steal the show with their skillful performances in this movie. Rebecca Romijn Stamos' does a good job in her role as Mystique which will be forever remembered with the 'costume' merely being blue body paint and the bizarre stick-on scales to make Mystiques course skin and it's probably Stamos' most famous role in her entire career. Interesting camera angles I must admit.
Others though don't fare as well. While none of them are near horrible or fatally catastrophic, some characters should've been giving much larger roles and could've been much better both appearance wise and personality wise. Rogue, Storm, and Cyclops are among the best characters off all time but in the film, they are reduced to two-dimensional characters with Rogue and Storm being the particular ones as the comic books show them as beautiful, intelligent, and elegant, but on the film they hardly show any of the elegance nor intelligence that they have been in the comics for almost 40 years! Anna Paquin doesn't do a bad job playing Rogue but her character hardly shows Rogue's emotional trauma that the comics have showed time and time again and simply looks more like a helpless victim. Sabertooth while awesome looks more like the bearded lead singer in the rock band Metallica (No offense to the band). Jean Grey looks more romantically involved with Wolverine than with Cyclops. What's with that? Cyclops is almost as uninteresting as your average stranger and hardly shows the romantic relationship with Jean Grey.  All of these characters in my opinion are in dire need of improvement on their part especially Storm and Rogue. However, all of these flaws in the characters I mentioned are forgivable in my opinion, considering how difficult it was to adapt a HUGE and rich comic book series to the big screen and it could've turned out disastrous, but instead they pulled it off quite well. There's lots of room for improvement though and hopefully the cast will do an even better job on X-Men 2.
Although I'm not complaining about it, some characters don't even show up in the film at all. Gambit doesn't join the X-Men until much later, Henry McCoy aka Beast doesn't either, nor does Jubilee. That's OK though. Gradually the X-Men movies shall improve upon the previous as time goes on and hopefully it'll have a long theatre life as opposed to the Batman movie series that probably wound up being killed by the box-office bust, ""Batman & Robin"".
Although I love this movie a lot, even I cannot deny that there were plenty of flaws to the film. Despite all of these things, this movie is a great one to own and has a strong message of the effects of bigotry, prejudice and racism and it's destructive effects on society as a whole. The fight scenes in some of them are awesome especially Wolverine battling Sabertooth atop The Statue Of Liberty and the incident at the train station. Overall, while this movie could've been better. This is just my perspective but I think that this first X-Men movie is more of a warm-up to the possible action-packed sequel X-Men or the ones after it. I just hope that this will become like a long lasting movie series that'll go for years and years. I think that they did a good job at adapting the X-Men to the big screen and is a good first start.

1263957,5,B00003CX8I,"From the pages of the popular Marvel Comic, the X-Men spring to life on the big screen in a very successful way. The story deals with Mutant beings who are feared and loathed by human beings because of their powers, a team of good mutants led by Professor X ( played by Patrick Stewart) must protect mankind from a evil mutant named "" Magento"" ( played by Ian Mckellen), whom believes that man can never co-exists with Mutants.
A highly entertaining and phenomenal sci-fi comic book that has great acting, excellent cast ( Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ray Park, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Stamos, and Anna Paquin), a good storyline and tons of intense spectacular special effects. A comic book movie that kids and adults can enjoy together, it's truly one of the best comic book movies ever.

This movie is what a lot of us had been waiting for years, a movie based on a Marvel series that wasn't terrible (IE: remember Dolph Lundgren in that awful PUNISHER movie? And let's not forget any of the made for TV Marvel movies that also did no justice to the great Marvel name).
Now for any of you older X-MEN fans that have some of the original comics, X-MEN the movie does stray away from the original series because in the original series, the first X-Men were Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Angel and Ice Man (when they made Ice Man like a snow man). This one went with the most notable X-Men, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm and Rogue. That and another thing that might bother older fans is how Rogue is introduced as a 16 year old girl when in the original series, she is introduced as an enemy to the X-Men after stealing the powers of Ms. Marvel.
One last thing that absolutely bothered me was that Sabretooth wasn't the 8' tall, buff as hell, ominous monster that he is in the comics. Personally, he looked like a regular guy who snarled and had bad nails. Don't get me wrong, X-MEN the movie is otherwise nearly flawless and very entertaining and very cool. I'd suggest this movie to anyone, whether Sci Fi fans, X-Men fans or Action movie fans. It's definitely worth your money!

Loaded with excellent actors Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Barry (Storm), Rebecca Romajn-Stamos (Mystic), James Marsden (Cyclops), Famke Janssen (Dr. Grey)  and Patrick Stewart (Xavier), the film delivers eye-popping visual effects as well as non-stop thrills and action throughout.  Each mutant possesses thier own unique special power.  Wolverine has razor-sharp claws that extend and retract, Storm has the ability to control the weather, Cyclops has red laseres that shoot from his eyes, Dr. Grey has telekenitic powers, while Xavier can read people's minds.
Xavier has nurtured the mutants through the disguise of a ""school for gifted children"".  However, he concentrates his efforts on helping mutants use their unique powers to help better mankind.  Wolverine, who is found by Storm and Cyclops stranded in a snowstorm after an attack by Magneto's thugs, is taken to Xavier's school.  Here, he is helped by Dr. Grey and Xavier to harness his powers.  Rogue, a young girl who was travelling with Wolverine, is also brought along.  She too possesses mutant powers.  She has the ability to absorb other mutants' powers into herself.  Magneto finds out about Rogue and devises a plan to capture her and have her absorb his powers and use them for evil.
She tries to flee by leaving on a train, but Wolverine follows her and catches up with her on the train.  However, Magneto is there as well and manages to capture Rogue.
The climactic battle between the X-men and Magneto takes place in the Statue of Liberty during a United Nations metting in New York City.  Magneto plans to channel his power to Rogue so she can in turn steal all of the power from the U.N. delegates.

1264005,5,B00003CX8I,"Having grown up with comic books like the X-Men and its cousins, I tend to take them for granted now.  This is the era of far glitzier issues with whole teams cooperating to make the pages shock and titillate.  Life was a bit tamer then, comics were fun, but not exactly earth-shattering.  So thinking ""The X-Men, Ho-Hum,"" I did not bother to see the film when it came out.  That was a serious mistake.  I have a very large monitor, but there is no question but that I should have seen it then.
This film is remarkable for many reasons.  First, the script is as fresh and up-to-date as could be.  Gone are the super heroic declamations (other than when Dr. Xavier and Magneto argue) and in their place is good, dramatic dialog delivered by talented, professional actors.  Then there is the filming, which consistently avoids any sense of cramped or overly open space.  It provides a seamless background for the special effects.  If the dialog has been brought down to a human scale, the visual imagery completely exceeded my expectations.
Casting is wonderful too.  Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) seem made for their parts, and the rest of the cast are no less able.  This is not a Dino De Laurentiis film with one or two good actors using spectacle to cover its weaknesses.  Instead, we have an entire cast that conspires to make the unbelievable real.  And Michael Kamen's music is also a treat.
The film brings home far better than the comic series ever did that the problem being dealt with is not really good mutants vs. bad mutants.  Instead, the real issue is that these mutants are trying to live in a world full people who are suspicious and fearful of those who are 'different.'  This is a talel about the effects of prejudice, clothed in an action story.  The protagonists stand for two possible solutions.  Sometimes one can understand Magneto (Ian McKellan) despite his willingness to use evil for his purposes.
The plot is the simple tale of Logan and Rogue's (Anna Paquin) coming to Dr. Xavier's school and the ensuing struggle to stop Magneto from turning a ray that makes humans into mutants on an assembly of diplomats.  Each of the characters contains a story, often deeply tragic, and each has given something up as the price of their talents.
The DVD is a bit short on extras.  A short on the film's making, an interview with director Brian Singer, and various other bits and pieces.  A special feature that adds back in other versions of scenes sounds interesting, but actually amounts to very little.  This is a worthwhile film. If it did not have quite the impact on me that the first Star Wars did, it still was an engrossing experience in a jaded world.  Recommended.",1031184000,2,2712,4.663157894736842
1264056,4,B00003CX8I,"The long-awaited comic book-to-film translation of X Men left some fans satisfied and some wanting more. There are some terrific action scenes and great characters. Veterans Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are terrific, as are Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The Special Effects in the film are inventive and amazing. My favourite SFX moment: Where Magneto is walking across a pathway created by moving metallic planks across a chasm, the pinnacle of cool. Director Brian Singer has loaded the film with eye-popping visuals and some great one-liners. Michael Kamen's futuristic score (one of his best) adds to the mysterious tone. After watching the film several times through, there are a few little quibbles. Wolverine is a great character, but a bit more exposition on the other characters would be good, and the rather stringent running time leaves the film a bit short on great set-pieces. Still, that's what sequels are for!

1264058,5,B00003CX8I,"Wow. This is the BEST movie ever. It felt like they weren't mutans, but special people with great powers. My favorite character was Storm (I want those powers!). If you like the ""cartoon"" X-MEN, then you'll like this movie. I think it's so great that you'll watch it more than one time (I can't even count how many times I watched it). This movie was done very well and the special effects were really great. I don't know what else to say, but here are some things about stories of the characters.
Storm: is my favorite and she has the power to controll the weather and that is how she can levitate (by using the wind). In this movie she is played by Halle Berry. In the movie she was a teacher at the Xavier School for the Gifted (I think that was the name). She is just great. in the movie she uses her powers and that was why I re-watched it for countless times. The Beast really seems to hate her (you know the Beast that fights with Walverine and trys to brake Storm's neck). Storm is the best!
Cyclops: has the power to beam something out of his eyes and in the movie you don't even get to see his eyes. He has a problem with Walverine because Walverine likes his girlfriend (Jean). That's about all about his, and he was also one of the first students at the Xavier's school (including Jean and Storm).
Jean: has the power to move things with her mind and can also read minds. She is Cyclop's girlfriend and one of the first students at Xavier's school. She came close to danger of dieing when she tried to use Xavier's machine for finding new mutants. She is the one that Wolverine likes.
Wolverine: has the power to heal quickly and also has sharp metal coming out of his hands (not his mutant power but a result os an expiriment on mutants. He likes Jean and says some ""bad"" and funny things to Cyclops. He has a painful past that Jean sees when she trys to read his mind.
Rogue: has the power to steal powers and life essences of others. She is very close to Wolvarine (a father-daughter relationship). She is very powerful and Magneto trys to use her for his evil plan, that could indeed destroy lives. She is around 16 and 17 years old.
Xavier: he is not important but he has some helpful powers and he helps the other characters in this movie. He also has some problems with Magneto.
The Evil Mutants: Magneto is the leader and with him, there are four of them. Some of them also have interesting powers (especially Mystic).

1264059,4,B00003CX8I,"The first thing I have to say about ""X-Men"", and the only thing I really need to say, is that what makes it good is that it`s very creative and a lot more human than other action movies. Unlike when people came out of ""Spiderman"" saying, ""I wish I had super powers so I could save the world,"" this movie portrays the heroes as being cursed as well as gifted with their mutant abilities and makes them characters seem more believable.
I wasn`t familiar with the details of the story of all the X-Men when I came into the theatre, but I knew of Wolverine, and the unanimated version of Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman, known mostly in this movie as Logan, is an awesome character who steals scene after scene. He often shares the screen with Anna Paquin, who plays the young Rogue that Logan becomes close to. And, staying loyal to the original X-Men story, he also takes a liking to Jean Grey, which causes a lot of tension between him and her boyfriend, Scott, known as the X-Man Cyclops. (This competition between them contributes to some of the funniest moments in the movie, such as when Logan seemingly displays his middle, um, blade at Scott.)
I like that there`s a lot of feelings between the characters and it`s not just a romance sub-plot like in the Batman movies. The romance is actually a pretty insignificant part of the movie. The friendships make the X-men seem like very good people and distinguishes them easily form the villians so that they`re not just humans with superpowers just like the mutants they fight. (Might I mention the villians are just as cool as the good mutants. If I had to pick my favorite mutant aside from Wolverine I don`t know if it would be a villian or a good guy.)
You should especially see this movie if you are a fan of the comics because the interpretation of the characters is extremely imaginitive, but even if you aren`t too familiar with X-Men you can really enjoy it anyway. And you should just see it no matter what because super hero movies are becoming extremely mainstream. See Spiderman for the action, but then go rent this because it`s a lot smarter.",1025481600,,2109,4.552631578947368

Smooth acting from Patrick Stewart hold this movie together and is compimented by a nice performance from Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Anna Paquin (Rouge).  I found the other actors a little too cheesey for my liking, but thats probably a true reflection of their comic book characters.  The movie has cool, but not overly ground-breaking special effects.  The plot is pretty basic, but that's comic books for you. The movie runs along at a nice pace and is pretty much action packed from beginning to end.  The DVD has some nice extra features.

1264062,5,B00003CX8I,"Yeah, that's right.  A lot of people who considering themselves ""X-Men"" elitists will tell you this film was horrible and was nothing like the original comic book.  Well, they're half-right.  Some of the things, like the origin of the entire X-men story were not completely the way they were made.  And customs were different, yadda yadda.  Look, I'm not an expert on them, I only read a few comics and watched the original cartoon.  Oh, and I read some of the Uncanny X-men...all very good stuff.  So, I somewhat know what went on with all the original stuff and let me get one thing straight: All the characters in this movie were perfectly cast.  I know that Rouge's character (played by the young and beautiful Anna Panquin) has been highly criticized.  But what they don't realize, is that this is Rouge when she was younger...so she had not developed her normal ""strong"" approach and attitude.  Some people just want to see all flash and bang and are quick to criticize.  Read the damn comic book until you die if this doesn't satisfy you.  As far as comic book movies, this one ranks right up there with the original Batman and Spider-man for greatness.  Anyway, now on to the appeal for the mass audiences...
The X-Men takes places while the world is changing and recognizing humans evolving (mutating) into new creatures, per say.  A lot of controversy is stirring and sides are beginning to form in the mutant world, specifically between Magneto and Professor X.  They each have their team of men they aide them in their fight.  It's the typical good vs. bad idea.  Now, Magneto, he wants a mutant called Rouge...she possesses the ability to absorb other peoples' life-forces (and powers if they are mutants).  Magento wants her so he can use her (in a way I won't reveal) to open the eyes of the human public.  Professor X, along with his team of X-men, of course plan to stop Magneto.  There are also many subplots involving Wolverine (his relationship with Rouge and his past) and Magneto and Professor X's relationship.  With intelligent and entertaining dialogue, complex characters, the actors fluidity with each other, good fight scenes, magnificent special effects and an excellent story X-men will not disappoint.",1023840000,,2232,4.836411609498681
1264063,5,B00003CX8I,"X-Men, like Spider-Man, has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. In the near future, humans evolve, or mutate, and attain special powers. But, because of this, un-mutated humans fear them, and thus, some mutants revolt aganist them, causing chaos with their powers. Luckily, not all mutants use their powers for revenge. They understand why the humans fear them and help them, even if the humans don't accept it. One day, a man named Logan was using his secret mutant powers to win a wrestling match at a bar. He left the bar because the humans found out about his powers, and another mutant secretly hitched a ride in the back of his pick-up truck.

I'm glad I did, because this movie is great.  I guess the visuals are the real stars of the film, but the actors are still good.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as Proffesor X and Magneto, respectively.  Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is on the mark, and the character Toad (Ray Park) is cool in his own way.  The script is good for the most part, but it does have some clich&eacute;s, such as Wolverine and Cyclops fighting over Jean Grey, or Storm giving Wolverine a lecture about choosing sides.  Also, a few lines weren't written very well, especially when Storm is about to fry Toad with a lightning bolt.  She says, ""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?  The same thing that happens to everything else!""  I just don't see the threat.  But all of the jokes were great, my favorite being the ""Middle Claw"" with Wolverine.

I saw the theatrical release and watched this on VCR, but the DVD format is super.  The interviews with director Singer on the Rose show really tell us what he was doing with the film; and he did deliver.  The cartoon comic characters are there with enough action and pacing to keep the kids' interest, but there is also the depth of levels with themes of racism and intolerance to pique the adult viewer's interest and make this a movie ABOUT SOMETHING more than just the cartoon.  The actors turn in fine performances.  I enjoyed the extra material in the DVD version.  We had fun watching part of it in French.  The Fox commentary with Bruce Davison's Senate campaign commercials and the mock news format was a fun addition to the film.  The actors' interviews are illuminating.  I enjoyed seeing what the actress who plays Mystique (the blue woman) looked like.  In retrospect, I really enjoyed the control Halee Berry shows with the character of Storm.  This is a DVD that adds to the viewing enjoyment of the film.  If you've seen this in other formats, you'll want to catch this one.  Storm shines!",1020643200,,1232,4.643518518518518

Anna Paquin, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen shine as well. Halle Berry doesn't really work as Storm though; she doesn't have the tough look or right personality for the role. Angela Bassett would have been a better choice, possibly. Plus it would have been cool to see Beast, Gambit and Night Crawler in it, but I understand why they weren't, because who needs an overcrowded cast?

1264147,2,B00003CX8I,"I must admit that after watching X-Men, I felt that I must be getting old. Normally, even when I don't relate to a movie, I understand how a certain age group or a certain segment of society could. I then try to review it with that part of the audience in mind. I knew in advance that X-men was wildly popular with many teenagers. It has already gained a sort of cult status. I tried to decide whether or not I would have been bowled over by it when I was seventeen. I decided I would not have been. So, while there is a constancy to the young, it stands to reason that each generation is somewhat unique as to what turns it on and what doesn't. I concluded that I might have been better of watching X-men with a group of kids. Then I might have had the answer. Or maybe I should have just ignored my parents' strict ban on comic books.
X-men is based on the wildly successful Marvel Comics series. The time is the near future. According to the story, we are in a period of evolutionary change. The result is a growing number of people who are mutations. These people have extraordinary powers, which can be used for good or for bad. Some members of Congress fear these mutants and want to pass a law forcing them to register with the government. The mutants have banded together into several groups. One major group is led by Professor X [Patrick Stewart]. He has founded a school to teach young mutants how to live with their powers. He believes coexistence with ordinary mortals is possible. The other major group, headed by Magneto [Ian McKellen], thinks that their survival can come only through annihilation of 'normal' people. Professor X's team [the X-men] must stop Magneto and his troops before they reek havoc on the rest of humanity.
There are many elements in this story that could have led to a great movie. It is full of colorful characters. Magneto has the power to magnetize metal, while Professor X can read minds. Wolverine is able to heal himself instantly after every battle. Cyclops is equipped with laser vision, Storm can morph into another body, and Raven literally has a touch that can kill. The special effects are all decent enough. One problem is that there is little character development. The characters react as though they have feelings, but these feelings seem superficial. There is little of the depth and angst that made Batman, which had a similar plot, so memorable. In that picture the hero was almost as dark and troubled as The Joker, the villain so wonderfully played by Jack Nicholson. At the same time, both characters had a wonderfully wicked sense of humor. X-Men's director, Bryan Singer, is one of the best, but he seems to have been unable to take characters from a cartoon book and make them anything but cartoon-like. Yet the movie also does not aspire to be a spoof or a satire. The great actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen could have had a field day with this material. Instead, they are required to play serious, and that seriousness may be the movie's biggest problem.",1016409600,,3028,4.588560885608856

1264149,4,B00003CX8I,"Being a DVD person, I got this tape as a gift. While I am disapointed that it is Pan and Scan instead of widescreen, I guess that's just the name of the game with the format. I was actually suprised to find that this tape did feature deleted scenes after the feature presentation.
As far as the movie goes, it's rather engaging. Not up there with Richard Donner's 'Superman: The Movie' or even the gothic-classical realm of Tim Burton's 'Batman,' but never the less a solid comic adaptation.
Taking elements from a variety of eras of 'X-Men' mythology, it is set in the very near future. It opens with a dirty, shocking and bizzare sequence in Nazi Germany. It then flashes forward to Jean Grey addressing Congress concerning the Mutant Registration act. Meanwhile, her mentor Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, the only choice in my mind.) confronts his former friend, current advesary, Magneto (Ian McKellan of LotR fame). And so on.
This film is firmly rooted in character development, rather than fight scenes. The three main characters (in regards to character development and screen time) are Rogue (Anna Paquin), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and the aforementioned McKellan.

Don't get me wrong I loved the movie and I am a huge X-Men fan, but we have to realize that Rouge did not get that white streak in her hair from Magneto's machine she got that when she took Ms Marvels powers and that is also when she got the ability to fly. Not to mentioned that they kill Sabretooth he is like one of the best villians that they have as for Toad I don't remember him ever being in the comic books. I was heartbroken when they did no include Gambit, Beast and Juggernaut on the movie. I think that if they make a second part they need to include more of the original comic book characters.

1264153,5,B00003CX8I,"How do you take the best selling comic book and turn it into something that everyone will enjoy?  Well you got yourself the best example ever in X-Men.
First off we all know the story, mutants, Professor X, and Wolverine.  It's all good, the fan boys have bought this film to death.  So my review is geared towards the non-fan boys.  Because they should be the only ones that do not own this film yet.
By the way fan boy = comic book lover.
So heres the dealeo.  X-Men starts off by telling us the tragic story of how mutants and humans are having trouble coexisting, this burr is stuck between a certain senators unmentionables.  Thus creating stress between the two races.  In comes Magneto (picture villian with power to control magnetism)a mutant with a cause.  To kick all humans ....  Here enters Prof. X the good guy with mind powers and his X-Men (basically lots of mutants that help the fella out)  Plus we get treated to how these characters focus around two other mutants, Rogue and Wolverine who meet up in the Canadian outback.  The story then progesses along and well I won't tell you anymore, sorta ruins the whole movie watching process.
The DVD in itself is awesome with really neat interactive menus and lots of goodies to keep one entertained for awhile.  But I think they should have at least added in mutant biographies to give non-comic fans an idea of who these characters are and describe them a bit better.  All in all though..it's still super well done.
The story and movie is excellent as it has a lot of action scenes to keep everyone buckled in.  Plus the acting is a pure treat to watch.  The actors in this movie really made it work.  Just a great movie to sit down and watch.
In closing, if your not a comic book fan and thinking ""eh is it really worth it?"" my answer yes it is, it is at least a must rent and a eventual must own.  Great watch and feast for the eyes, the special effects are great and nothing is done below the par level.  So go out and get this film people, what still reading this review?  Go! Shoo!
By the way, fan boys not having this film yet (unless of course your anti marvel) you better go out and get it. Nuff' Said.
Till next time true believers. Excelsior!",1015372800,,2216,4.374083129584352
1264154,5,B00003CX8I,"Fear and dread crept over me as I first began to follow the making of this movie. I cringed as Ana Paquin was announced as Rogue, I cried when they didn't cast Derek DeLint as Magneto (who looks a lot like Jim Lee's interpretation of the character) and when I found out that Beast would not be making an appearance in this film I lost all hope for this movie being any good. I figured that X-Men would enter the tradition of [bad] super hero flicks along side the Batman movies... Thankfully Bryan Singer and David Hayter (AKA Solid Snake of Metal Gear fame) are geniuses and handled the X-Men, the limited budget, the costumes and everything with a surprising accuracy that made me see this movie almost as much as I saw Episode 1 when that came out. Only with this film it wasn't the title of the movie (though I am a huge X-fan) but the movie itself. X-Men was surprisingly well written, and now I've sworn to marry Ana Paquin... For what they set out to do, although her accent could have been more consistent, she worked perfectly as Rogue, and Ian McKellin is fantastic as Magneto, no... Perfect. These actors (except Hally Berry as Storm) became the characters for me. They worked out so much better than I had though, especially new comer Hugh Jackman's incredibly accurate portrayal of Wolverine. Jackman IS Wolverine as far as anybody needs to know. The story is much better than most comic to movie translations, and the best part is that the movie stays in the grays the way that the comics do, not having any villains that are just pure evil (except Sabretooth, who is sadly under used in this film.) The fact of the matter is that X-Men is definitely a super hero flick done right, it stays true to the spirit of the comics with only Storm being a disappointment. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it's mostly tongue in cheek, and over all the movie is a lot of fun for people of all ages, weither or not they're X-fans, I firmly believe that most people looking for a good action drama will love X-Men.

With several serious undertones of race, equality, and politics, there's a classic veneer of witty one-liners and excellent special effects, coupled with a sensitive story-line and well-presented action sequences.

The movie is heavily changed from the comic history, and for an X-men buff like me, that can be a little dissapointing. Also, some of the acting wasen't all that good.

Singer did not just a good job, but an outstanding job with the special effects and the storytelling and such. As far as the acting goes, Patrick Stewart (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") was an excellent choice as Professor Xavier. In fact, I knew that they would pick Stewart for this role. And as for Hugh Jackman (who appeared in 1998's ""Paperback Hero"" prior to doing ""X-Men"") as Logan/Wolverine, Jackman was brilliant! We all know that Hugh Jackman is from Australia, and that ""X-Men"" was his first American production. But when Jackman gets right down to talking in that American accent, he does it with perfection all the way! And that is what makes Jackman the actor that he is today, with lots of charisma and style as well. The supporting cast, including Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique), Tyler Mane (Sabertooth), and Ray Park (Toad) gave great performances as well! The DVD transfer of this was simply amazing! Especially with features like Hugh Jackman's screen test, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, behind the scenes footage, and much more! ""X-Men"" is the best comic book adaption ever made since ""Superman"" and ""Batman""! I cannot wait for the ""X-Men"" sequels to come out!

1264209,2,B00003CX8I,"The X-Men comics were one of the richest mines for a movie franchise among all comic books.  A complex central issue dealing with alienation, bodily image, race, prejudice, plus a cast of troubled but iconic characters -- what more could a movie want?
Well, for one thing, a script.  An appropriate cast.  Performances.  X-Men the movie had high aspirations, but so many of its pieces were just flat-out wrong.
Granted, I had scoffed at the new image the movie had crafted for these characters, especially Cyclops' oversized goggles.  But the costumes turned out to work better than I thought in this movie.  No, the problems with X-Men are casting and script.  It's no wonder that the one actor who rises beautifully to the challenge is (then) newcomer Hugh Jackman.  Though a little young for the character of Wolverine, his great physique and feral presence suited the movie terrifically.  But the script offers him nary a chance to really craft something immortal, like Michael Keaton in Batman.  Simply put, the script is Thin with a capital T.  The central plot gets lost midway through the movie amidst all the exposition about Professor X's school.  This was necessary, but it was placed in the wrong part of the movie and resulted in the main plot grinding to a halt.  After the brilliant juggling trick he did with the kaleidoscopic plot of The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer disappoints in this movie, not quite able to make the mishmash screenplay work.  The characters of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Professor X, Storm and Rogue all became completely one-dimensional facades, which worked contrary to the movie's message that there's more to mutants than meets the eye.  Wolverine's memory loss is given no payoff.  Senator Kelly's melting trick (as Magneto says, ""Are you sure you saw what you saw?"") is not explained, as if the screenwriter simply forgot to wrap up that strand of plot.
And then there's the actors.  With the sole exception of Jackman, everybody looks tremendously uncomfortable.  The wonderful Ian McKellan is given little to chew on, plus a ridiculous-looking helmet and costume to match.  James Marsden as Cyclops looks like one of the Coneheads.  Famke Janssen is about ten years too old to be playing Jean Grey, failing along the way to project any of the charisma of the character, making us question why in hell Wolverine is so enamoured with her. (...because the comic books said so.)  Halle Berry is embarrassing as Storm, manifesting not a  shred of the elegance and intelligence of a wind goddess.  Anna Paquin as Rogue looks all right, but never probes into Rogue's psychological pains and instead comes off as a pure victim.  The villains fare better by virtue of being simpler:  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is lithe (though practically mute) as shapeshifter Mystique, and Ray Parks (Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode I) dazzles with a combination of acrobatic displays and mechanical effects as Toad.
I think I would have questioned the suitability of the actors to their roles a lot less if the story had simply moved along better.  As it is, I get neither the satisfaction of watching a good comic-book adaptation nor a good sci-fi/action movie.",1014595200,7,3175,4.943396226415095

Unfortunately, Marie (more commonly known as Rogue) has to live with this mutation.  Unable to live with her mutation, Rogue runs away.  She soon finds herself face-to-face with Logan (Wolverine): a man with incredible healing powers and metal througout his entire circulation system, which gives him his metal claws.

On the road, they hit a tree in the road and Wolverine goes soaring through the windshiled, leaving Rogue trapped in the car with a fire burning inside.  As Wolverine goes to help Rogue, he is attacked by Sabertooth: a mutant who works for the evil Magneto, a mutant with the ability to bend metal, who is trying to turn all humans into mutants with his machine.

Xavier promises to help Logan and Rogue.  But after Rogue flees from the school, Logan defies Xavier and goes to rescue her.  When he finds Rogue, Magneto and his mutants appear.  Magneto kidnaps Rogue and runs off with her.  The X-Men sit down and finally they discover why Magneto wanted Rogue: he is planning to use her power to harness another mutant's power against the world.  He will give her his power, and then she will power his machine which will transform all of the humans to mutants.  There is only one consequence: Rogue will die from the machine.  And after Xavier becomes deathly ill, it's up to the X-Men to save the day.  With great action, romance, and the occasional hilairous remark, ""X-Men"" is THE movie of the year!",1012608000,,2050,4.822349570200573
1264214,5,B00003CX8I,"Very well done.  Careful, well constructed plot. (Remember plots?  Apparently, most newer movies can't afford them anymore.)  Everything supports the story.
I have some quibles and this was probably done to make a few of the special effects, easier and less expensive.  They loose some sense of place by showing only a pitch-black night background during the train station scene.  It makes things look a little too studio sound-stage and a day or near day setting would have been better for those events.  The last scene is OK at night because the water, lights, and NY setting gives a sense of place.
This is one of my favorite movies.  It seems like it has been worked and re-worked, for efficiency of telling the story with as much content about characters and events as possible.",1012262400,,783,4.798507462686567

On the other hand, they really messed up on the casting of certain characters (read: Storm), and the storyline for others (Rogue is supposed to start out as evil!).  Although I think David Hayter's script (and his other work as the voice of Solid Snake) are cool, there's really no denying that this is the same crap Hollywood always puts out.  Honestly, the fight scenes were really just special effects showcases, and I really would have liked to see more character development.  Hopefully, the next movie should address these issues.

(USA - 2000)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS / SDDS

In a brief interview with director Bryan Singer (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, APT PUPIL) included in the supplemental materials of the original US DVD edition of X-MEN, the alarmingly young-looking helmer explains that the film - originally intended for a Christmas 2000 release - was abruptly rescheduled for summer of that year, forcing the entire production to scramble desperately to realize its lofty ambitions. Against all the odds, the final product (based on a long-running Marvel comic series developed by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Chris Claremont and Len Wein) demonstrates a profound maturity that lifts it head and shoulders above the massed ranks of mechanical Hollywood blockbusters, whilst simultaneously delivering the kind of effects-heavy spectacle that audiences have come to expect from this particular sub-genre.

Whilst bigoted politicians are fomenting unreasoning hostility toward a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers including telepathy, pschokinesis and/or mind control, representing the next stage in human evolution - a benevolent psychic named Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has established a private school where he teaches particularly gifted mutants to channel their abilities safely. But some of his most powerful students - played with earnest conviction by a number of Hollywood's sexiest rising stars, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden - are called upon to challenge the wrath of Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant supervillain whose hatred of mankind was cultivated in a Nazi concentration camp (outlined in a harrowing opening sequence, where the film's sober intentions are signalled in no uncertain terms), and who is determined to launch a devastating assualt on the world's non-mutant population, igniting a war between the species that only the mutants can win.

The unusually clever scenario provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, without skimping on either aspect of the production. That's due partly to David Hayter's concise script, Singer's ingenious ability to convey a wealth of relevant information at high speed without rushing or obscuring the details, and a strict adherence to the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.). The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen may seem unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors elevate the proceedings beyond the confines of mere 'Good and Evil', adding real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team are somewhat underused, but they certainly LOOK spectacular and they make the most of their limited screen time, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen.

Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of a rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's Panavision photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins, reflected in the DVD's similarly-styled packaging.

While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia, the only form of prejudice which remains openly condoned throughout society. Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protestors gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? These themes are further underlined in a Fox TV special included on the original DVD release, constructed as a series of news reports surrounding Congressional hearings on a proposed Mutant Registration Act, wherein Davison holds court with almost religious fervor, spitefully twisting the evidence to suit his own rhetoric, only to be laid low by an amusing final twist that mirrors the downfall of many a similar real-life politician. This particular interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) that he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it certainly provides plenty of food for thought...

However someone not familiar with the books may have a bit of trouble with the charecters. All in all a fun movie and i feel the best of the comic adaptations.

1264280,3,B00003CX8I,"I disagree with those who say this movie remained faithful to the comics themselves... Particularly with the way the movie seemed to adjust the timeline--placing characters in the film when they shouldn't be, leaving out people that should be there based on the people they DID include, or making them appear at an age inappropriate to match the characters around them.  There were just a lot of things that didn't add up.  It WAS an ok movie, and it even had a bunch of fantastic scenes that really brought out the personality of the characters (like Wolverine's cage fight scene early in the movie)--but then there were other times when I thought the writing/acting didn't do the character justice at all... Rogue, for example, didn't quite come off as her usual self, nor did Magneto have enough of his cool, calculating charisma. Oh well.  It's a watcher, but not neccessarily a frequent re-watcher.",1008460800,,903,4.888888888888889

REALLY good actors (Hugh Jackman ROCKS as Wolverine) and actresses (gotta love Halle Berry - she plays STORM), great special effects, and the movie is complete, yet leaves JUST enough open for a sequel.

1264322,4,B00003CX8I,"Before I get into this I should mention that I was a big X-Men fan back when I was about 11-12 and avidly collected the comics. So I went into this thing knowing who these characters were. That didn't prevent me from liking this movie though. In fact I appreciated the nods they put in to characters they didn't get into detail with (Iceman, Shadowcat)in this movie. Let's face it, there are enough X-Men out there to dedicate at least thirty movies to. Concentrating on these specific characters was the only way to make the movie work. Who really cares that Rogue doesn't have the powers she absorbed from Ms. Marvel when she was a villain and Mystiques young charge? Some things had to change to make this movie work and they did what they had to. Upset? then read the comics and leave the rest of us better adjusted types (i.e. those of us who have actually dated people and moved out of our parents basement into homes/apartments of our own)alone. I couldn't think of anyone better suited to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart. He is a great actor. I saw him on Broadway doing his one man show of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol in '95 and I knew then he was far more than Jean-Luc Picard. This man is a great actor with lots of range. Don't believe me? Check out ""Jeffrey"" for some amazing work by him. But I digress. He was great in this as was Hugh Jackman. I was a little disappointed in Halle Berry as Storm though. I didn't feel she had hit upon the spirit of the character.
Here's an interesting tidbit I stumbled across: during part of the production Joss Whedon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame was brought on board to do a little work on the script. He admits to writing both the best and the worst line in the movie. I'll leave it up to the viewer to figure out which lines they are. Look for Spiderman in the hidden features on the DVD, he shows up to help our heroes out.",1006646400,,1894,4.338028169014085
1264323,4,B00003CX8I,"The X-Men is a great movie both for it's entertainment value and it's theme of tolerance. This is a classy film--moderate profanity and no graphic violence. I have watched it several times now on DVD (saw it once in a theater). I am probably part of the film's ideal audience--having never read the comic book the things different in the film (such as lack of yellow spandex) don't bother me. I think the parts were very well cast, the dialogue is strong and the direction is quite good. Also, the DVD has excellent picture and sound quality and several extras, including a ""special edition"" of the film with deleted/edited scenes re-inserted.
Ironically, the included Fox special ""The Mutant Watch"" contains overtones of petty politics and politically correct racism (the Senators favoring mutant registration are white male Republicans, while those speaking against are minority race Democrats). I am an independent, not a Republican, but still found this appaling enough to knock a star off the final rating (I was going to give it five).
All in all, I still highly recommend this DVD. I rate The X-Men as one of my favorite movies of all time.",1006646400,,1147,4.887179487179488
1264324,5,B00003CX8I,"Whenever a comic to movie transfer occurs, an extraordinary amount of originality is required, or else the movie will simply (be aweful). Comic books are a very choosy medium that require the reader to fill in many of the mental gaps and assume a wide variety of odd comic book physics. These things, when translated into a live action movie, generally appear to be campy and unrealistic if not altered dramatically.
Thank god Marvel *finally* got that hint after a fleet of terrible comic book movies and gave the X-Men a new look and feel so that they work on the big screen. I'm not just talking about the costumes...I'm talking about the character attitudes, the character interactions, and, specifically, the filming of the action scenes.
Like the Tim Burton Batman films, this is comic book adaptation done well. The amazing performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and others outweigh the wooden and unengaging performances by some of the supporting cast (fortunately, they didn't give Storm many lines).

I watched it, and I saw a fine tradition of comics make it's first successful transition to the big screen. I was thrilled and excited. Like the first time Superman and Spiderman teamed up.
I have to say, that when I first heard about this movie, I was sure that ""They"" couldn't get the characters right. Well, I was 90% wrong. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Xavier were all magnificent. There were some adjustments made to ages of other characters, but that's okay. Every story teller changes things to suit their tale. I think Grace Jones would have made a better Storm/Ororo, but my opinion wasn't sought.
The only real flaw in the movie is the focal point on Magneto.  The characterization was good, but the characterization of Magneto's ethics, the core beliefs, fell short here, and I was very upset. Magneto was/is a character whose goal differed from Xavier's in that he felt mutants should live apart from humans, instead of with and amongst them. His protectiveness of mutant-kind (Homo Sapiens Superior), and his perception of mankind (Homo Sapiens) as the equivalent of the Nazi Reich, was what kept him on the outside fringe of law and order. The character himself believe in justice, and honor.
So he wouldn't have played it the way he did in the movie. Eric Magnus Lensher would never have sacrificed someone else to do something that he could do himself. It was something that was integral to how he was seen by the world at large, and his own feelings about mutant brotherhood.
Keep in mind, this is all from the perspective of one who grew up on the tales of these heroes. From the fresh perspective of one uneducated/untainted (depending on your point of view) this is a good movie for action buffs, anime fans and those who like one-liners throughout.

And Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin give the film real emotion. It's their relationship that defines the concept that the X-Men are tragic superheroes. He's a man who chooses to be a loner, she's a girl who's forced to be a loner. And though Jackman gave the most entertaining performance, it is Paquin who gives the best performance in terms of pure acting. She has to make you care about Rogue if you're going to care about the movie. And she does an excellent job of it. Paquin plays Rogue as a real teenage girl with a horrible affliction. You care about her because you believe her character. You feel for her.
Director Bryan Singer should be applauded for casting these four excellent actors instead of big name stars or Hollywood bimbos. By going with quality, Singer tried to give the comic book genre intellectual and emotional weight. He succeeded.
Great special effects, action, humor, and a great performance from the cast makes The X-Men one of the best comic book films, ranking alongside Batman and Superman. Let's just hope the X-Men sequels are better than the sequels to those films.",1002931200,2,1260,4.811059907834101

With that acknowledgement out of the way, I want to say that ""X-Men"" is easily the best movie adaptation of a superhero comic book that I've ever seen.  Before seeing it, I, like all the other fans of the comic book, was wary about how accurately the characters will be portrayed.  We have really no reason to trust Hollywood to be faithful to the original comic book considering their incompetence in previous similar efforts.  Man, I still can't believe Superman took Lois to the Fortress of Solitude and that Batman revealed his identity to some stupid girl, even if she happens to be Kim Basinger.  However, I had no such complaints about how the X-Men were translated onto the screen, and in fact, fans of the comic book will be hard pressed to come up with any significant differences between the movie versions of Professor X and Wolverine and their comic book counterparts.  I am especially delighted that the filmmakers decided to retain the moral grayness of Wolverine and his lack of compunction over the act of killing.  I also liked how many of the plot elements were left unresolved, because it means that a sequel will surely follow.  Another likely bonus for X-Men fans in the upcoming sequel is the appearance of Kitty Pride and Iceman, who were both briefly introduced as young students at Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted.  In an effort to be objective, I will admit that the story did suffer from excessive expository dialogue and unnecessary scenes that appeared to have been inserted only to serve as descriptions of the respective capabilities of each mutant.  But heck, that just means the sequel will be even better since the writers will only need to concentrate on the story.  Overall, this movie will make you forget the real world for 90 minutes and will make kids wish they could squeeze into a microwave oven in order to mutate themselves.",1002067200,,2288,4.747474747474747
1264405,1,B00003CX8I,"Bryan Singer proved he was a good director with the usual suspects and what is here looks good and is stylishly done. Infact it would have made a great first half of a film. Unfortunately it is the whole thing! The film sets up the sequels really well and they might well be good films, but when i pay to see a movie i want to see a movie, not an extended trailor for a soon-to-be movie franchise. This is like the pilot of a T.V. series. Sets up the characters, ends with a short action sequence to show what they can do and that's it. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!",1001980800,6,557,4.166666666666667
1264406,5,B00003CX8I,"When creating a movie about the X-Men there is undoubtedly a large amount of pressure on that persons shoulders.  So many people were looking forward to this picture to do theie favorite comic book characters justice on the big screen.  I am happy to say that the screen-writer and director both did a fantastic job with X-Men.  The plot is fairly complex, the charcters well cast(save Halle Berry, I could have done without her), and the action is kept up and supported with a great storyline.  The movie is great for fans of the comic book but people who have no idea who the X-Men are can also enjoy it since there is no real backstory for the movie needed to enjoy it.  The ending was left wide open for a sequel or two and I can't wait to see Hugh Jackman back in action.",1001808000,,776,4.324137931034483
1264407,2,B00003CX8I,"There are two ways of watching ""X-Men"": either as a bad sci-fi flik, or as a worse film version of the comic book/animated series. As a sci-fi flik, ""X-Men"" isn't as bad as it is silly. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine has an overmoussed 'do, Patrick Stewart never comes off the screen as anyone but himself, and the fight sequences are so heavily computerized that the characters are almost continuously in the air.
If watched as a film version of the classic comic book series, things get infinitely worse. ""Humanized"" in the best Hollywood traditions, the X-men act like sulky teenagers: they push and curse and ""claim their girls."" The last is especially ridiculous, since reducing the cast of X-men to three essentially ensures that there's a love triangle. The conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine for the affections of Jean Grey is ludicrous in the extreme. Storm, the only other ""official"" team member in the movie, is a non-entity. Where are Beast, Gambit, and Nightcrawler?
Continuing efforts of making the movie more ""mature"" lead to very few improvements. The movie makes the leap from cartoon violence to real violence: in the cartoon, we would have never seen Wolverine run his claws through Mystique. We would have never seen Senator Kelly, the mutant-hating McKarthy clone (R-Kansas), agonizingly dissolve into water.
The plot is a miracle of compression: the impression is that the writers tried to squeeze in every last bit of X-men lore and then tossed out or changed whatever they didn't like. Thus, the central storyline is a retelling of the first episode of the cartoon series, only with Rogue (her sheepish character has nothing at all to do with brash but competent woman from the cartoon) in place of Jubilee (the only other change is that Wolverine is not yet an X-man, which makes very little difference). When the movie tires of this thread, it switches to Magneto's evil plot to change everyone into mutants, if only to allow for more floaty fight sequences.
A lot of the original's entertainment value came from the intrinsic exoticism of the X-Men's allies and foes. Thus, Cyclops and his team fought Apocalypse in ancient Mayan temples, Magneto in the Lost Land, and even Deathbird in outer space. Here, there are three villains besides Magneto: Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad - all of them with zero backstory. The writers forgot that Mystique is Nightcrawler's mother, and that her power is shape-changing, not acrobatics. Isn't Sabretooth supposed to have resulted from the same cruel experiments that created Wolverine?
Magneto (Ian McKellen) is really the only sympathetic character in the film, probably unintentionally. I could identify with his cynical view of mankind. He was a significant character in a crowd of cardboard cutouts.
""X-Men"" ends on a happy note: I was happy that it was over. I'd much rather watch the cartoon.",1001721600,,2864,5.031578947368421
1264438,4,B00003CX8I,"All right, admittedly, this isn't ""The Usual Suspects.""  It is, however, a well-done adaptation of a comic with a frightening backstory, both in terms of complication (I'm certain every single X-Man has died at least once, and if they haven't it's coming) and, well, stupidity.
I should say where I come from; I hate the comic.  Love comics, hate X-Men.  It's not a comic book, it's a lifestyle, a monstrously twisted and convoluted backstory that REALLY needs to be cleaned away (DC Comics has the right idea, doing some huge event that purges various problems and contradictions.)  As such, boiling it down, let alone rendering it watchable, would have been hard work.  Yet this is a perfectly accessible movie; you don't have to know ANY backstory to enjoy it.
Bryan Singer at the helm definitely helps, but the cast is also mostly sharp.  I wish Halle Berry hadn't done so many Quaaludes before every scene, but she's the only bad apple in the bunch.  The film shows a definite vision and cohesiveness a lot of action movies lack, period, let alone an atrocity like ""Batman and Robin.""  The script is compact, well-written.  I only wish there had been a little more...but then, a good action movie always leaving you wishing for a little more.
This isn't Tim Burton's ""Batman"", but it's excellent and I definitely think it should be in the discriminating action fan's collection.",1001376000,,1383,4.851063829787234

What's up with those stupide costumes the're wearing?The only one that looks true to the original character is Prof X.The special effects are pretty good i'll give them that and i guess Magneto is kinda cool too it's an ok movie if you just wanna watch a movie but i find that hardcore comic book fans will agree that it could have been way better.,1001376000,,537,4.173076923076923
1264440,5,B00003CX8I,"This was a much better movie than most moviegoers expected, following a series of superhero movies about as enjoyable as a root canal. Bryan Singer does a superb job of directing. The script is well-done and very polished - barring a few lines that fall flat, such as Storm's quip about toads and lightning. While I question some of the casting decisions (bad-boy James Marsden as Scott/Cyclops, the quintessential Boy Scout?), the acting was also uniformly excellent, especially Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. The special effects are seamlessly integrated, making each character's mutant powers seem both supernatural and utterly believable, and look especially good on DVD.
Now for the DVD itself. The deleted scenes are nice, although most of them were taken out for good reason, as they're just expanded versions of scenes that stayed in the movie. I do like the special option that lets you watch the movie with the deleted scenes spliced in, though...this is a feature that more DVDs should have. The video and audio quality is good, and the extras are interesting and worth a look (I liked the enjoyably hokey ""Mutant Watch"" documentary).

rookie with the series.
It seems to me that the movie was for all intents and purposes a two-character film, with Rogue and Wolverine taking center stage(and doing quite well at it).
There were a few missing elements (If I remember correctly Mystique is Rogue's Mother!), but the action was tight and fast.
I hope the sequel irons some of these loose ends out--and gets everyone's favorite Cajun, Gambit, on board!",1000857600,,479,4.517241379310345

 Now,about the technology used in the movie,it's just great. The sound effects are so good. I also felt in love with Mistique's costume,it was so creative(it really was pretty good).The music was the least thing that I liked from the movie,I mean,couldn't they at least have one vocal singing song to give more exciment to the movie?.Although the story changing was like the biggest mistake in this movie,it still make it cool for people who are newbies into the x-men world. I recommend everyone to buy the DVD version. A 10 minutes footage had been added to the DVD and it has a lot of extras. Now,why did I gave this movie only 4 stars? Well,although the story seen to go a little slow and it concentrate more in some characters leaving many other important characters out,it still makes its point.

I'm comparing this movie to the Michael Keaton Batman flicks. Now THAT's how you turn a comic book into a movie! This is closer to Batman Returns (which I give 2 stars) than to Batman (5 stars).

Other than that, the movie was fantastic. My favorite mutant, aside from Jubliee, is Storm (played beautifully by the stunning Halle Berry) the mutant with the ability to control mother nature. My favorite scenes are the train station scene and the battle inside the Statue of Liberty. When Sabretooth thinks he has defeated Storm by grabbing her throat and slamming her against the window, she turns the tables on him and kicks his [butt]. She summons the fierce lightening and blows him back threw a concrete wall. WAY TO GO! The other scene which is almost haunting is when she is fighting Toad and he kicks her down an elevator shaft (notice how he does his Darth Maul move afterwards, hence Toad is played by Ray Park). Then all of a sudden the doors to the elevator start to shake and glow with lightening. Then the doors blow open and the STORM ARISES out of the shaft. See the movie and find out what happens.
I would not have picked a better person to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart. He is an amazing actor. Another mistake was Ian McKellan playing Magneto. It looked like my grandfather was in the film. They could have expanded Cyclops and Jean Grey a little more. I have never been a fan of Wolverine, until this movie. Hugh Jackman gave his character a whole new dimension. I love Wolverine. I can't wait until the next movie. I hope we see more of Storm, Jubilee, (rumored) Gambit and Jean Grey.

You have the most angry, destructive, comic book character (besides the Hulk) in Wolverine how could you not take advantage of that.

Third, you have an all-star cast!! Hugh Jackman (""Someone Like You"", ""Swordfish"") plays Logan (Wolverine), a mutant with the power of atimantium claws coming out of his fists. Wolverine is a traveler who gets guided to a place where mutants are regulars lead by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Conspiracy Theory""). You also have Cyclops (Scott Summers, James Marsden, ""Disturbing Behavior"", ""Gossip"", ""Sugar and Spice"") who has the power of a laser beam coming out of his eyes and Storm (Ororo Munroe, Halle Berry, ""Baps"", ""Swordfish"")Anna Paquin (""Fly Away Home"") ignites the screen also as Rogue (Marie) who discovered that she has very a sensitive touch. Famke Janssen plays Dr. Jean Grey whos boyfriend is Scott Summers. She had the power of telepathy and telekinetics (the same as Xavier).

The script is superb and the directing is top-notch. ""X-Men"" brings you everything and more. The special effects are incredible and the illuminating plot is definently an A+. ""X-Men"" is a blockbuster hit and 20th Century Fox was the perfect company for it. Finally, the Blockbuster is here.

1264479,4,B00003CX8I,"Continuing his character and plot driven craftsmanship from ""The Usual Suspects,"" Bryan Singer does a fine job of balancing between the hardcore X-Men fans and those who had never read the comics. A surprisingly enjoyable movie, this has a good dose of the humor of the comics (c'mon, they're mutants - that's inherently silly) while providing a serious dramatic thread (Hugh Jackman's performance as Logan is a breakout, as we can almost feel his anger at the world and his frustration with not being able to remember his past). The real standouts here, though, are Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, who dominate the two sides of the movie. It's a real treat when two actors of their caliber can go up against each other in a movie. The DVD is flawless, and has plenty of fun extras (Jackman's screen test, obviously done after the original actor playing Wolverine was injured, is interesting to see). A small warning to parents: the flashback scenes are quite intense and more than a little disturbing. There is one glaring omission to this DVD, probably the result of it being rushed out for the winter holidays: there is no commentary track from Bryan Singer or from anyone else. That, and the DVD menus can be annoying to navigate.

1264480,4,B00003CX8I,"When translating comic books to the screen, it is typically a hit-or-miss affair. The last real success was Tim Burton's 'Batman', which is still debatable. Incredibly, it took a non-comic film like 'The Matrix' to elevate standards beyond the schlock that characterizes the 'Batman' series. 'X-Men' meets the difficult standards of portraying characters everyone already knows and walking the fine line of making them realistic without destroying their identities. Doing this while making a film that is its own coherent work while doing justice to the comic series is another fine line to walk. In every way -story, effects, acting, characters- 'X-Men' pulls it off. Beginning with the concentration camp scene was startling, and a stroke of genius; Magneto's depth of character was both well acted by McKellan, and well set by the scenes of demagoguery. By focusing on Wolverine and Rogue to create depth, without burdening the story with every aspect of the heroes, the good-vs-bad struggle does not come across as merely effects-driven eye candy. Leaving enough loose holes at the end to make the story bigger for sequels, one isn't left with a sense that they're going to bastardize the whole concept just to make a buck off of McDonald's Happy Meals, as the 'Batman' series has become.

The plot of the movie is really quite simple but is given a lot of intelligence by the clever dialogue and good set-ups.

Wow! Good casting, too, as you can see. Okay, back to the facts. The screenplay is neat and has heaps of depth, action, technology, adventure, science, chemistry and comedy. I enjoyed all the action sequences and the film is really hard to dislike, even for people who have never heard of or read the comic book. The story seems quite realistic too and you can even believe its happening, which is a big compliment for a fantasy flick. I loved the techno music on the soundtrack too, really good stuff for a party or something.

1264485,5,B00003CX8I,"Normally when I watch a movie based on a comic book I cut it a bit of slack when it comes to things like character motivation.  After all, we are dealing with characters who are larger than life.  Heroes wear white and are motivated by a sense of justice, villains wear black and do their evil deeds basically because they are evil.
This sort of basic motivation has even snuck into mainstream movies.  Gladiator and The Patriot both had villains who, when asked why they do the evil deeds they do could be expected to reply, ""Because I'm the bad guy and that's my job.""  The heroes of these movies are motivated by revenge rather than justice.
Here comes X-Men and shows them up with style.  On one side we have Normal Human Senator Kelly, out to register Mutants because he is afraid of them.  He is afraid they will make him obsolete, afraid they have the ability to destroy him at will and he has no way to protect himself from them except by marking them as dangerous beings.
On the other side is Magneto, a mutant with the power to control metal and a survivor of the Holocaust.  He sees this as an attempt to bring back those bad old days and is ready to fight it at all costs.
Both of these villains have motives that are wholly understandable.  In today's movies that is unusual.  In a movie based on a comic book it seems remarkable.
In between these two forces are the X-Men led by Professor Xavier who is out to keep the peace, prevent Senator Kelly's Anti Mutant law from being passed by legitimate debate and similarly try to keep Magneto from killing Normal Humans.  His team rescues Wolverine (Hugh Jackman in what should be a star making performance) and Rogue (The lovely Anna Paquin) from an attack by Magneto.
Purists to the comic book may balk at the variations from the original, but these things almost always happen when translating a story from one medium to another.  Even a simple origin story like Superman went through variations when translated to film.  The fact of the matter is that this movie treated the source material with respect in a quest to make a decent movie and the result is a movie which should have been hyped as an event when initially released.",997056000,5,2193,4.496221662468514

1264501,4,B00003CX8I,"I saw this movie last summer, and i thought it was pretty good... then i started reading the comic book. Although most of the basics are the same for the movie, there are some pretty big changes they made that I thought were a mistake. The biggest mistake that they made was to make Rogue be a shy and frightened teenager. Although that is how Rogue first appeared in the comics, I think it would've been best to portray her as the spunky, out-going thirty something she became in the series. They also made a mistake in casting Halle Berry as Storm. The problem with Halle Berry is that she doesn't exude such a strong willed, strong person overall as Storm should be. Angela Basset would've been perfect in this role. I did though, particularly enjoy Patrick Stewart's dead-on portrayal as Professor X. He not only has a striking physical resemblance to the Prof, but he also got his persona down to a T. I also thought Hugh Jackman did a great job as Wolverine, considering he's a full foot taller than Wolvie is supposed to be, thereby defeating the purpose of the name Wolverine. But nonetheless, I think that this movie works because it isn't just about fighting and kicking and all of the other action [stuff]. It has a good message to it, and the sentimental scenes between Paquin and Jackman were really well done. I, though, being a comic book fan, prefer to think of this movie as the X-men in an alternate timeline (which, the x-men have many of).",994636800,,1459,4.551330798479087

The acting was much better than I expected, and the storyline was well defined and moved quickly.  The special effects and action sequences were particularly well done, with a few ""standard"" action movie one-liners, but with minimal cheese.  I found Halle Berry to be totally miscast as Storm, and her acting was the weakest, although she had a very small role and not much character to develop.  The ending easily allows for sequels, so I expect there will be more.",994550400,,565,4.793814432989691

The plot is pretty average. Nothing wowzers. It's not very immersive or provocative, but also not bad enough to put you to sleep, like The English Patient.
The other main aspect of this film was the special effects. Again, they weren't state of the art, eye popping ones, like The Matrix.
To sum it up: X-men is your typical action film.
If your're an x-men fan, then you'll probably like this.

It's definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the movie or the others I mentioned.  It has some pretty good special features.  The Hugh Jackman screen test was cool, and I was scratching my head wondering why a couple of the deleted scenes were not included in the final cut.

This is a fun movie, but more than that, it fits in enough drama and characterization to rise about standard action fare. It didn't try to be brilliant, but it tried to be thoughtful and good and it succeeded. Few will proclaim it a masterpiece, including me, but I will call it entertaining fun with a soul. I have shown it to many non-comic people and have always been pleased by their surprisingly favorable feedback.
For what it is worth, I hope the good folks at Fox are making another solid script and director Brian Singer priorities for the sequal. I hope they don't, but fear they will count on just the X-Men name to carry subsequent films because that is not what made this show financially successful or good.",994291200,,897,4.475609756097561

It has always been very hard to bring comic book characters to the big screen believably and not let them stay too 2 dimensional.  Except for some of the poor wirework with the flying characters the special effects were excellent and the sets were extremely well done.
This was definitely a star making vehicle for Hugh Jackman, but Halle Berry will always look good on the movie posters.  I sure hope they can flesh out her role in the next chapters of these characters.  The little snippet they had cut out of the movie (but shown in the DVD extras) as she teaches the class was not enough for you to get to know her character.  I am sure they will do better with the Cyclops and Jean Grey characters as well.  Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) was definitely a great she is so bad, but looks so good character.  Hope to see her again too.
Everybody go get this movie.  You can watch it over and over again, its PS2 compatible and just plain fun.  (Buy it and let's make sure they make another one).",993686400,,1158,4.454976303317536

The DVD's screen test with Jackman in it left you with little doubt that he is a true actor.

Halle Berry is a cream puff, she doesn't have the amazon looks of the real Ororo Munro/Storm. Same for Anna Paquin -- she's no woman, just a little runny-nosed girl, which is very disappointing. But then again, the story involves her earliest introduction to the X-Men organization.
What does make the movie is everyone's favorite bad boy, Wolverine. Hugh Jackman steals the show in his movie debut, but what do you expect from a stage actor -- the man can act. You don't doubt him for a second. His story is very interesting too.
The depiction of the X-Men school is great. So is the depiction of Magneto, Sabretooth, and did I mention Wolverine? He's the MAN. You'll notice the pace of the movie accelerates towards the end, but otherwise it's a good flick.",993340800,,853,4.655629139072848
1264527,4,B00003CX8I,"This movie was actually pretty good for a comic-book movie, or any action movie for that matter.  Some of the people who gave it one star apparently don't know how to listen well to the big talking heads on the movie-theatre screen.....how the mutants ""got"" their powers is ""explained.""  Um, they were like, born with them?  Duh?  That's what a mutant is, a chromosomal abberation.
Secondly, people complain about either not enough action or not enough character development.  It was OBVIOUS the focal point of the story was Wolverine and Rogue.  Their story was the fulcrum point for the whole film and a way to get the ball rolling for following movies.  These two characters were developed really well, and I felt satisfied with the exposition of the others considering their most outstanding personality traits were touched upon.
Also, this movie had more to offer than just action and comic-book icons.  It really portrayed how cruel the dehumanization of those different from ourselves can be.  This lesson was balanced with the message of non-violent protest and change through understanding and education, rather than annihilation and force.  The viewer can sympathize with both Xavier's and Magneto's (yes, that's their names :P) causes, but one realizes that Magneto has been possibly hopelessly scarred by his persecution at the hands of Nazis, and he refuses to let his hatred and anger go and channels them into a very deadly, inhumane cause.
There were some problems, of course.  How come Xavier didn't know there was a mutant in the academy?  Maybe he has to focus on what he's looking for, I don't know, but that threw me off.  Also, some of the lighting was really bad.  It was most noticeable in shots of Famke Jannsen (Jean Grey).  The unflattering shadows actually made her look quite unattractive at times.  Also, in the scene where Magneto has Rogue in the big ""mutant-o-matic"" at the end, Scott and Jean argue about ""taking a shot,"" and Jean keeps telling Scott to wait.  For what, praytell?  I still can't figure this out, and I hope someone else here understood what they were quibbling over.  I also found Halle Berry's performance a bit lacklaster on more than one occasion, and her white wig really should have been constructed better.  And of course, Sabretooth and Wolverine flew JUST a wee bit too far when they jumped or were pummeled by 2x4's.
All in all, however, this movie accomplished its aims, I think, and was well done, especially in comparison with Batman and Robin, the latest teeny-bopper horrors, and Battlefield Earth, to name a few.",993081600,,2578,4.909930715935335

1264531,2,B00003CX8I,"Apparently considered to be the breakout performance of Aussie native Hugh Jackman, X-Men delivers what most consider to be an exciting mix of fantasy and adventure.  All I can really see in this film is a mish-mashing of unrealized characters and confusing lines of dialogue.
Now, for quite some time, I considered myself an X-Men fan, I only had about some 25 comics based on the mutated humanoids.  So, naturally I had at least 15% of my conscious self involved in the decision to see this movie.  Of course, my interest in the comic book heroes kind of died out about 3 years prior to the release of the movie, so I wasn't really into it.  Anywho, what I saw in the theaters came near to disgracing what the comic had set out to achieve.  Then again, what does a comic really give us besides a series of storyboarded illustrations.
The movie X-Men proves to be less than even a series of random displays.  Obviously (for anyone who's seen the previews) they chose Wolverine to have the main part.  I guess I can see that, but why Rogue as the other main character?  And especially, why Anna Paquin as Rogue?  I don't really know what the casting director was thinking.  Much less what the screenwriters were thinking.  I absolutely love Storm's lines (ex: ""Hold on to something"" ""Do you know what happens to a toad when it is struck by lighting...the same thing that happens to everything else..."").  I mean, come on.
Plus, we only get to see Professor X for about 5 minutes before he has an anuerysm and falls faint for the final thousand minutes (or like what it seemed like to me).  Finally, we see the oddly cast Ray Park as Toad, fresh from his identical role in George Lucas' Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.

Hugh Jackman breaks through amazingly as the gruff Wolverine. Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry round out the X-Men as Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Storm respectively.  Anna Paquin plays a young Rogue; which is one of my few beefs with the movie.  Having Rogue as a teen works with the movie, but is totally out of sync with the comics.
Other characters who surfaced as teens included: Shadowcat, Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, Cannonball and Colossus.  I also believe that Nightcrawler and Beast made an appearance, although both looked basically normal, so I could be wrong.
The villians were Toad (played by Ray Park Jr.), Sabretooth, and Mystique (played by supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).  Senator Kelly also played a large part in the film.

1264565,5,B00003CX8I,"At last, with comic book adaptations, Hollywood is starting to get it right. The first, but hopefully not the last, movie to feature Marvel's merry mutants benefits immensely from a superb cast, an enthusiastic director, and an intelligent, thoughtful approach that makes this more than just another ""superhero"" flick.  In the near future, more and more people are revealing themselves as ""mutants"" - genetically altered people with superhuman powers. As the US government considers passing Senator Kelly's (Bruce Davison) Mutant Registration Act, two extremely powerful mutants ponder their species' fate. Telepathic Professor X (Patrick Stewart in the role he was born for) believes in teaching mutants to develop their powers for the good of mankind, whereas his old friend Magneto (Ian McKellan) wants simply to wipe the human threat out. Caught in the middle of all this are Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with energy-sapping powers, and Wolverine (a superb Hugh Jackman), an older, battle-hardened mutant.  And so the scene is set for great fun and action, as well as far more character development than you'd usually expect from this sort of film (you certainly didn't get it in Batman and Robin!). Thanks to Bryan Singer for showing Hollywood that you can make great superhero films, you only need to respect your material.  The DVD transfer of this excellent movie only serves to make you appreciate it that much more, with a great attention to both visual and audio detail. In fact, it is one of the best quality DVDs on the market! The extras, whilst not many in number, are certainly fun to sift through more than once. The ""Mutant Watch"" featurette is a lot of fun, and much better than the standard ""Making Of"" documentaries that get churned out. The character designs hint at hero and villain outfits that seem much better than the costumes that ended up onscreen (there is also a hidden section that looks at two unused characters, Beast and Blob), as does the production designs (ultimately, I believe that it was Fox Studios capping the budget that made the director rethink his approach).

The story wasn't sacrificed for the action although the story moves fast and there is a lot of action.  The introduction with Magneto and his parents being rounded up by the Nazis was compelling and helped make Magneto a little more sympathetic then he otherwise would have been.  Ian McClellan is great in the role.  All the actors do a good job, especially Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin.  The special effects are very impressive.  I especially liked the scene with Magneto tearing the train apart.  The fight scenes were exciting and well choreographed.
I know there are those die hard fans of the comic book series who won't be happy with the exclusion of characters or the inconsistencies in the continuity of the Marvel Universe but even the comic changes over time.  I haven't regularly read an issue in years but I recall that Wolverine's claws are now bone.  As for remaining true to the spirit of the comics I think the movie did a great job.

1264569,5,B00003CX8I,"In the near future, a new breed of humans--known as mutants--begins to emerge from the general population. Gifted (or cursed, depending on one's standpoint) with a variety of extranormal abilities, these mutants face fear and distrust from society. But under the leadership of Professor Charles Xavier, a group of these mutants has banded together to help light the path to a better future for both mutants and normal humans. This is the premise of ""X-Men.""
Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter David Hayter faced a daunting task in taking the massive X-Men mythos (which has evolved through decades of different comic book titles, and has involved an encyclopedic number of characters) and adapting it into a feature film. But, together with a superb international cast, the filmmakers succeed brilliantly.
A prologue set during the Nazi Holocaust sets the overall serious tone for the film--a welcome change from the increasingly campy and ridiculous ""Batman"" film franchise. Yes, ""X-Men"" is a science fiction film with plentiful action and special effects. But at its heart, this film is an intelligent drama about characters who face crises and challenges.
Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) squares off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a rival mutant leader with a radically different philosophy. Add to this struggle Bruce Davison as a McCarthyesque, mutant-hating U.S. senator, and you have a rich tapestry of ideological conflict which serves as a backdrop for the frequently explosive action. But overall I found the emotional core of the film to lie in the relationship between Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a seemingly indestructible warrior with retractable metal claws, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with the ability to suck the life force out of others. Each of the actors delivers an excellent performance.
The mutants of ""X-Men"" can be seen as metaphors for any feared or persecuted group in human history. Ultimately, the film celebrates the ability of oppressed individuals to overcome alienation, to form supportive communities, and to work for a greater good. It is, I believe, the film's success in tapping into universal human fears, hopes, and ideological conflicts that elevates it above being merely an excellent sci-fi action epic.",990576000,,2274,5.354748603351955

While I do admire the effort, making Storm a history teacher, Beast was conspicuously absent from this film.  He would have made an excellent English teacher or a professor of languages.  He was already a medical doctor by trade.  I wouldn't have put Rogue and Jubilee in the same class because the orignal members were all in their mid-twenties or older when Jubilee joined them both in the comic books and on the TV show. Rogue already had the ability to fly, thanks to Marvel Girl.  At 14, Rogue was taken in by Mystique, ""Mama"" and coerced into sucking the life from Marvel Girl, leaving her in a coma and listed as a Jane Doe in the cartoon. At least Bobby's (Iceman) role was correct.  He liked to push limits with athority AND he was two years older than Jubilee.  Patrick Stewart played an excellent Professor X.

But X-Men shows that there's life in the old dog yet. One of the most popular comics around, X-Men centres around the very adult theme of racism, discrimination, and ofcourse, lots of great super-human powers and a juicy battle between good and evil. The film is a perfect mix of straight-faced storytelling and tongue-in-cheek in-jokes. Those who never take these films seriously will no doubt identify with Hugh Jackman's fabulous Wolverine, who never passes up an oppertunity to point out the stupidity of the situation. But things are carried out seriously and intelligently - hence the casting of first rate actors Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen as the leaders of good and evil. The script is never anything less than excellent, and the direction by Bryan Singer (the genius who gave us the indisputable masterpiece that was the Usual Suspects) is flawless. The supporting cast, made up mainly of unknowns (although sci-fi fans may recognise Ray Part, alias Darth Maul, as Toad) shows a great deal of promise. And the effects... well, probably inspired by the Matrix (a landmark in effects technology), this film looks fantastic. No effect is underdone, no set is not awe-inspiring. The music, alas, is where the movie is let down. Although dramatic and tense, there's just nothing memorable here. Gone are the days of the groovy title theme, by which the audience can identify the film.

As far as the story goes, it is well thought out and portrays the story arc well enough, but the absence of notable characters from the movie doesn't help matters a lot. The contradictions detract from the movie for someone familiar with the comics, but if I were new to the storyline, it would be an enjoyable exercise in fantasy. All in all the movie is well done technically. The DVD is really good and the hidden easter eggs are a nice treat.

The bad guys in the movie are more appealing then the good guys, but there should have been more bad guys. The picture and the sound on the DVD are excellent!

Had this movie not already been so thoroughly reviewed, I would have provided a synopsis.  That not being the case, I will simply add my two cents (and rating) to the average.
Short and sweet - if you like the comic (or cartoon), you'll love the movie.  Don't expect a deep plot or award winning performaces.  If that's what you're after - look elsewhere.  If you're looking for pure and simple entertainment, without the cerebral factor, you've found it.  My only complaint would be it wasn't long enough and there were too few characters.

1264592,5,B00003CX8I,"When I first heard about this movie, I was less than thrilled. Anyone can remember some absolutely awful comic-to-big screen adaptations (Need I remind anyone of any Batman after the first one?). I was worried about the special effects, I was worried about the director (believe it or not, I didn't know Bryan Singer's work from Adam). Well, let me say, DON'T WORRY.
In short, this is a work of art. Every character is dead on, with Hugh Jackman, as Wolverine, the newcomer-surprise. I'm looking forward to his continuing movie career. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are fantastic. The time they spend on-screen together is a joy to watch. And, I have to agree with the reviewer who praised Dougray Scott's inability to complete his work on Mission: Impossible 2 in time to film on X-Men. I actually liked him in Ever After, and he was pretty good in M:I2, but he is NOT Wolverine.
The deleted scenes are forgettable, with the possible exception of the extended school scene, giving us the chance to connect Jubilee to the actress (I missed that the first time around). Also, the easter egg in which Spider Man makes an appearance is perfectly-timed with the new movie coming out.
One can only hope that Raimi does for Spider Man what Singer did for X-Men. You must get this movie!!",986947200,,1284,4.711111111111111
1264620,2,B00003CX8I,"Maybe I shouldn't have expected much from the X-Men but with Bryan Singer at the helm and his Apt Pupil star Ian McKellen in front of the camera I figured at the very least it would be entertaining.  And it is that, but my biggest complaint is that the first twenty minutes are so exceptional in the way the transend the typical comic book fare that it's a shame to see the rest of the movie fall apart.  It's as though Fox executives somewhere along the line saw the dalies and reminded Singer that he was making a much anticipated summer blockbuster, which brings with it certain expectations.  These expectations are met in the form of off-the-wall action, flamboyant characters that take themselves far too seriously and lots of eye candy.
If I had to pick a star out of the ensemble cast it'd have to be Hugh Jackman, who's the only actor to leave any kind of an impression, in the role of Wolverine.  He's a mutant drifter with an uncanny knack for healing himself who uses his powers, he also has retractable blades in his forearms, to fight his way out of trouble.  He travels from city to city, town to town, making money at tough man contests.  Being as the Aussie's a bit of a pretty boy, and bears a remarkable resemblence to Gladiator star Russell Crowe, none of the bar thugs want to concede that he's the better man, even after he's pumbled their peers.  So naturally he cleans up at these events, or at least until he meets a young girl and fellow mutant named Rouge.  Rouge's power (or in this case curse) is that she drains the lifeforce out of anybody she touches, even if it's inadventant.
Reluctantly Wolverine takes up with Rouge and the duo hit the road.  And it's not long after that they find themselves targeted by an evil mutant, Magneto (McKellen), bent on waging war on the humans.  He's loathing of mankind is spawned from surviving the Holocaust, and having seen the depths to which we're capable he decides to vanquish us.  He's met with opposition from a professor, Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who operates a school for the gifted.  Little does the taxpaying public know that this school is actually teaching mutants to hone their abilites, in this case in a positive way.
Chief skeptic to that fact is a Senator whose overwhelming fear of the mutants leads him to press for a bill that would act as a segregation law to seperate their kind from ours.  With mutants already having to endure an intolderably high number of threats this bill would only serve to condone the behavior of those who would perpetrate these hate crimes.  With his hopefulness in mankind contuniously sinking, Magneto takes the first step towards war by kidnapping the Senator and turning him into a mutant himself.  By doing this to him, and others like him, Magneto fells he can take control of the Congress and ultimately the world.
Scribe David Hayter makes a concerted effort to blur the lines between good and evil, but instead of making the film more thoughtful he only confuses the situation more.  He tries to do exactly what I'm critizing the film for not doing enough of, and I in turn am critizing him for that.  Maybe the X-Men just can't win with me.  Or maybe it's that inconsistency, the poor balancing act done between social satire and breakneck action that perturbs me so.  The filmmakers seem uncertain in the direction they want to take to movie, so they oversimplify things.  They allow the picture to switch gears at random which sends the story into a tailspin.
But what did I expect? Unfarmilar with the D.C. comic, and not being a particular fan of comics turned into films in general, I must admit a bias against this movie going in.  So maybe I'm not best suited to judge a film of this genre, but I can only hope that Ang Lee's upcoming The Incredible Hulk realizes the potential that I saw in this picture's first few minutes.",986774400,,3862,4.592430858806405

Halle Berry as the Storm was a casting mistake.  Angela Bassett is the only known African-American actress who could have pulled off the proper blend of regal elegance and fearless of the character.  Ms. Berry was physically wrong for the role and lacks a particular ""presence"".  Patrick Stewart is perfect as Professor X.  Great suits!

Rogue is terribly tragic because she is a real teenage girl with a tragic affliction. She is forever alone. And Paquin is brilliant as Rogue. See this film.

The X-Men movie, however, managed to hang on to the decades old complex characterizations of its main characters, and show some of the depth that made the X-Men series such a good read all these years.  Casting of Prof. X, Wolverine, Magneto, Toad, Jean Grey, and the young Rogue was superb.  Toad actually surpassed his comic book version.  The previous relationship between Rogue and Mystique was ignored in favor of a new plotline, and Scott/Cyclops seemed a tad young for Jean, but I can live with that considering how well it all turned out as a package. The Storm character was nowhere near as strong, compassionate and imposing a character as she is in the book (group leader material once Scott gets out of the way), but since she was considered a secondary character in the movie, it was probably wise not to flesh out her personality as fully as it is in the books.  We would have wound up with just one too many subplots happening.  Hopefully in a sequel she'll really get a chance to shine.

1264626,2,B00003CX8I,"When I used to read comics back in high school, the X-Men were my favorite and so I watched this movie more out of sense of nostalgia than anything else. Unfortunately, it didn't exceed those rather modest expectations - this despite the fact that the X-Men seemed to me one of the few super-hero comics that could be effectively adapted into an SF film and gain an appeal outside of fans of the original comic book. But the director and writers seemed unsure about how to approach the movie: either make it a genre film for ""X-Men insiders"" or an SF thriller with broad appeal. The result is a little of neither. Even so, the acting is generally good in spite everything going against the movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are perfectly cast as Professor Xavier and Magneto, respectively, the two most intriguing characters in the whole X-Men story - personally I think the whole movie would have been much better if the story and action revolved exclusively around them. Here, however, they are generally sidelined (esp. Prof. Xavier, who spends a major part of the movie in a coma) as more emphasis is placed on fight sequences and special effects. Despite some very good, even moving scenes, like the first sequence showing Magneto's early childhood as a Holocaust survivor, the movie's plot is actually quite silly - believe me, comic books are written better than this. There is little in the way of interesting character development, since the story is based on a serial publication with dozens of characters and none of them are given a chance to really stand out. Perhaps that's the main problem: the X-Men would function much better as a television series than as a feature-length film.",985910400,,1702,4.812286689419795

1264628,3,B00003CX8I,"X-Men (Bryan Singer, 2000)
Singer is a genius, pure and simple. ANyone who could create something like The Usual Suspects has to be a genius. No two ways about it. And thus he was tabbed to do the long-awaited film version of the comic book X-Men. And to his credit, he did a wonderful job with what he was given.
The story centers mostly around Wolverine (an interestingly-coifed Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who find themselves thrown together and caught in the middle of a longtime battle between old friends Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Wolverine and Rogue, along with Magneto and Xavier, are mutants-- humans with various special powers. Magneto and Xavier run the two cliques of mutants, if you will, and Wolverine and Rogue swear allegiance to neither; they don't have much time to weight their options, though, as the two sides fighting over them attempt to recruit them for a very dastardly deed that Magneto's got going on.
A plot that simple would have made for a bang-up two and a half hour action film. Where the writers went wrong was in trying to add too much in the way of subplots, and they ended up with something a lot more confused than it really needed to be. A focus on the humanity of the mutants and the decisions that Wolverine and Rogue need to make would have been enough to fill a film (I mean, come on, the Usual Suspects wasn't all that long on plot, either; all the greatness came from the subtleties within an extremely simple mystery). Still, if looked at somewhat simply, it does work as an action film; there's a good deal of eye candy, stuff blows up, Ray Park does his usual flying-leap-all-over-the-place thing, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen aren't considered two of the greats for nothing, you know.

Score: 84/100
I didn't really know what to expect of X-Men. I really wasn't all that excited because I was not exactly a fan of the comics, and I never really cared for superheroes. But this film surprised me beyond belief, I really liked it and I saw it twice at the movies, both times the level of excitement and interest were unbelievably high!
In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them ""mutants"", the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Daivson). The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to stop him. In the meantime, 2 mysterious mutants, one named Logan (Hugh Jackman), a powerful and agressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) emerge. Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?
X-Men is a largely enjoyable and well-paced comic adaption that mixes thrills, action, science and comedy all into 90 minutes, and does it quite superbly. The star-filled cast all have a blast, really bringing the mutants alive, newcomer Hugh Jackman in particular, he's really quite stunning as Wolverine, and he is going to be huge. Famke Jenssen and Halle Berry should've been used more, but the plot is mostly worked around Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen + Jackman and Anna Paquin, so it really uses up most of the room. But, that's a minor flaw, in an awesomely-decorated, excellently strung-together piece of work that is much better than anyone had the right to expect.

Another thing that fries me is how the director of this film made the Canadians all look like yahoos that only give a damn about cage wrestling and beer.
The story has something to do with Magneto making some super crazy thing that will turn everyone into mutants. How? Beats me.
Once you get by the hour of talk and small spars in between scenes (where the characters seem to defy all laws of gravity) you get ""the big fight"". I heard someone from the film talk about ""the big fight"" at the end, and had trouble figuring out which one it was; or, if there even was one.
In the end we have two mutants fly into the water, and Magneto captured. What the ending lacks, however, is an ending. We are given cliffhangers, and are to assume that there is to be a sequel. I don't want to see it. The director, writers and producers should have done a better job polishing up the first one, instead of setting up for a second.
The movie will not be a bust. Xmen fans were probably camping out to see this, and probably were disappointed, as I was. And there are sure to be some more diehard fans out there for the sequel. And maybe that is the only thing saving this film, is it's liscense. Had this been characters we didn't know, it no doubt would have failed miserably.

Don't get me wrong here, Singer's debut film 'The Usual Suspects' still ranks as one of my favorite films of all time, but it so much different then adapting one of the most beloved and revered comic books of all time. But in the end Singer turned out to be the perfect choice. Why? His attention to characters. The X-Men, from it's earliest days, has always been a comic driven and defined by it's attention to character development, not just explosions and chaos. What Singer does here is miraculous. He takes a group of unbelievable characters and turns them into easily identifiable people, people who you might actually believe existed. The talented group of players lucky enough to play the roles in the film are uniformly fine. Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor Xavier, Famke Janssen is touching and alluring as Jean Grey, and Hugh Jackman (in a superb out-of-nowhere performance) brings humanity and lonliness to the imposing visage of Wolverine. The film also marks a bold departure from other films of it's kind in one more crucial area: special effects. Too many times the effects ARE the film, they are what holds our interest and define our excitement. While X-Men is by no means short on effects, the effects ENHANCE the characters instead of BEING the characters. These are people with gifts, we focus on them and not their abilities. The story is common-place comic book drivel, the good guys are out to stop the bad guys, blah blah blah... but it all hold together because of the intelligent and sometimes touching script. It's actually thought-provoking at times, a fact that makes me wonder why every other comic adaptation can not muster a single brain cell half the time. It is a fabulous achievement, a film that should not have succeeded but does because of a great script, wonderful performances, and assured direction from a man who is clearly out of his game. The DVD edition of X-Men is unique in one way as well: it's deleted scene can be viewed separately or pieced back into the film via a special 'branching' version of the film. It is clever and important. Many times I have watched the deleted scenes included in DVDs and been completely unable to get any impact from them whatsoever because they were being viewed out of context. This 'branching' feature marks a new standard and precedent that i hope many other DVDs will live up to. The picture quality is crisp and the sound is vibrant.

Yes, the sound, picture and effects are all very good. But that is all. I'm extremely dissapointed about the characters and the story. Some fightingscenes are laughable. Characters are made almost as if they came from the comic, but some features was put aside. A lot of characters was also missing. They Show Xaviers School, and they show the time when Wolverine entered the Xavier World. Where are all the other characters from that particular time? And when was ever Wolverine And Rogue friends? What a bad adaptation *sigh*.... I still ask myself if the director actually read the comic? And if he did, why did he do such a bad job of the adaptation? Did he only read a single comic or what?
The Phoenix-story is without a doubt the greates of them all. I'm hoping to see that one for the next film.
But, as far as adaptation for this film it is a lot better than Batman, Blade, The Mask, the very bad Judge Dredd and other bad attempts out there.
If you are NOT, as I am, a bigtime fan of the x-men comic, then this is a great film to watch. It has it all. Sci-Fi, action, comedy,story and excitement you could expect.
If you have read x-men for a while (iv'e been so far back I can remember), you will be dissapointed, I'm sure.
My rating is for the 'attempt' of making an adaptation of a comic. I was almost about to give it a 1, but changed my mind because some of the characters actualy are pretty good.

The premise of the story laid a great foundation but I felt there could have been both greater character development or additional plot twists that would have made the movie more interesting.  In short it seemed a little bit too predictable.
The film is very enjoyable anyway.  The effects are great and the acting is noteworthy.  Particularly Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart.

1264695,3,B00003CX8I,"The X-Men (if you are one of the half dozen or so people who don't already know) are a band of super-powered mutants who appear monthly in a number of titles published by Marvel Comics.  In comparison to many previous made for TV failures and direct to video flops this first major motion picture adaptation of Marvel Comics' characters was very impressive visually and had some nice moments of dialogue as well.

The premise of the story (both in the comics and the movie) is that occasionally, in defiance of the normally slow process of evolution, someone is born with a bizarre genetic mutation that gives them powers far beyond those of ""normal"" humans.  These mutants have become the latest in a long series of societal pariahs, feared and hated by an increasingly large segment of the general population.  In the face of persecution from a Joe McCarthy-like Senator, the world's most powerful telepath, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), has set up a special school to help young mutants come to terms with their strange abilities and use them to convince the world that they are not a threat.  His graduate band of do-gooders include telekinetic prodigy Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), optic beam firing Cyclops (James Marsden), and weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry).  To this group are soon added two newcomers: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is equipped with animal-keen senses and reflexes, the ability to heal wounds nearly instantaneously, and a skeleton and claws made of an indestructible metal.  Teenaged Rogue (Anna Paquin) is cursed by a touch that drains the life-force of anyone whose bare skin contacts hers.

Along with a hostile public, the X-Men deal with another band of mutants, lead by the master of magnetism, Magneto (Ian McKellen), that is intent on permanently eliminating the threat posed by the prejudice of normal humans.  Magneto's troops include the feral berserker Sabretooth (Tyler Mane); the leaping, prehensile tongue shooting Toad (Ray Park); and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).

The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, which totally captures the spirit (if not the letter) of the comic book character.  Other highpoints include the opening scene that explains Magneto's mistrust of humans, the interaction between former friends turned enemies Xavier and Magneto, the friendly rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops, the confrontation between Magneto and the police outside a train station, and the fight scene between Wolverine and Mystique.

Unfortunately, the story was not as gripping as it could have been and, with the exception of Anna Paquin's Rogue, all the female characters were given very little screen presence.  Jean Grey and Storm are two of the most powerful mutants in the comic book series, but in the movie they mostly stand around looking pretty and end up getting beaten up and/or having to be rescued. (Of course, what can you expect from a group that calls itself the ""X-MEN"" even though half its members are women?)  Even Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' Mystique (in the BROTHERhood of Mutants) only gets one sentence of dialogue in the whole movie.

The 10 minutes of additional footage on the VHS (and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B000AYELVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>) version all add a great deal of characterization to the film, and should never have been cut from the theatrical release.

Not only has it got to be so escapist andentertaining as to distract you from the implausability of it all, butfor every BATMAN there's a BATMAN & ROBIN.For every BLADE there'sa SUPERMAN IV:THE QUEST FOR PEACE!! Not being that familiar withX-MEN,I thought this might have failed. D'OH!!! What an excellentmovie. Definitely one of the best movies of 2000. For theuninitiated(ME!!) it's the start of a great new movie franchse,and agreat introduction to the X MEN universe. This is done through the eyesof its newer member,WOLVERINE(Hugh Jackman).What a revelation! Notonly does he provide a dark edge to an otherwise family summerblockbuster, but he steals the show with some killer lines andput-downs of CYCLOPS(James Marsden). Also a bit of inspired casting oftwo great Shakspearean actors,Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan asflipsides of the same coin. One preserving the fragile peace betweenhuman and mutant in a not too distant future,the other pushing forconfrontation. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My only gripe was thatit was all over too soon.  You'll be pining for X MEN 2 like you wouldbe for ... & 3. There,I said it!! ... and X MEN in the samesentence. It's that good!!  Now then: the DVD.I have to say that beinga lover of Region 2 discs,I found this to be as perfect Region 1transfer as you'll ever get.

Not only do you get a wealthof trailers,you get a ""newscast"" expanding on BruceDavidson's MUTANT Summit,and an interview with Bryan Singer. Did Imention storyboards? Also a screen test of Hugh Jackman with fellowAntipodean, Anna Paquin(great chemistry).  The big extra,though,is notonly do you get a wealth of deleted scenes,you can choose to watch aspecial X-tended Branching Version which jumps out of the mainfeature,and inserts the relevent deleted scene into the movie.

1264727,4,B00003CX8I,"I was amazed at how great the Movie was.  As and X-Men fan I was really impressed by the characters and the action that was involved in this movie.  Finally someone translated a comic to the big screen that did not suck.  From Hugh Jackman being a very believeable Wolverine, to Patrick Stewart being the perfect Professor X.  This movie was cast amazingly and the plot was easy to follow for those who have never read the comics.  But those who have will pick up the minor references to the many characters in the X-Men mythos.  I hope this movie gets everyone out there to go pick up the comic books and continue to thrill in their adventures.
My only knock against this DVD is that it is not the final one.  After I purchased this DVD I read that the director Bryan Singer was planning on doing a second DVD with even more behind the scenes feature.  So they released one DVD to get their sales done and now a second to make you buy it again.  This is the wrong move to do making people buy a second DVD to have the full movie effect.  But if you can wait until the second DVD comes out get that one, if you can't and still want to see a great movie with some really cool features on DVD get it.  This movie does rate five stars but lost points when I heard a second DVD was coming out.
As an added bonus on the DVD see if you can find the hidden scene with Spider-Man.  Hint:  It is on the Theatrical trailer page.",982195200,,1418,4.131386861313868

Then I watched it again with my husband. This is a really good movie. I had expected the over-cartoonishness of the Batman movies, but it wasn't like that. It had its cheesy moments (most movies do), but over all, it looked to me like any other sci-fi movie would. Hugh Jackman was a great Logan/Wolverine. Anna Paquin surprised me as Marie/Rogue. She was better than I expected. Famke Janssen (sp.) was the perfect Jean Grey. My least favorite character was Toad. He was obnoxious and disgusting. But then again, I guess he was supposed to be. :) Most of the cast played their parts very well. There were a few I could see being played by someone else. (The senator, Sabertooth and Mystique.)

1264729,2,B00003CX8I,"As someone who's been reading X-Men since he was a very verbal little boy (I'm 38), I was for the most part disappointed by this fairly well-made blockbuster.
The bad stuff: The film diluted the impact of two of the series' most distinctive attributes: a powerful, if melodramatic, moral imperative and an insistent female-centeredness, if not before its time then certainly uncharacteristic of the medium in general.
Jean Grey was a wimp and played by an ungifted actor. Storm was, well, Halle Berry. Imagine the difference if Angela Bassett had played the part. And Rogue was a teenager! You would never know from the movie that all three of these characters were the most powerful members of the team in the comics.
The good stuff: Despite the reduction of Rogue to a bipolar teenager I found the relationship between her and Wolverine to be credible, unique, fairly well-realized and appropriately grungy. Unfortunately everything after the pair stopped being central is mediocre.
The good stuff: Patrick Stewart was wittily cast.
Newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was beautifully cast, the only perfect move the filmmakers made: an expert balance of vulnerability and studliness
Other bad stuff: We could quibble about the fey choice of the worthy Ian McKellan as Magneto but I don't  think we could dispute that both McKellan and Stewart were way underused considering their prodigous capacities for overacting. Despite its source material, this movie could not be accused of being over-the-top. It wasn't over-the-top enough!

Bryan Singer really needed to give the movie some more plot.  I was fairly disappointed with it, because it seemed short and was over before it started.

And it's a movie that fans of the comic books have been waiting for over 30 years to see. Well, after all of this time, I think we can mostly thank George Lucas for developing the technology necessary to bring an incredible action film like this to life. ""X-Men"" is every bit as good as I knew it would be, just watching the previews at the movies. Just by the way the story was explained in the three minute preview, I knew that Bryan Singer was going about this the right way, which is ironically like the way the animated series went about it when it first debuted. I think I can give a lot of the credit to the cast picks, and the performances from Hugh Jackman (the best Wolverine we could've hoped for), Anna Paquin (a younger but nevertheless effective Rogue), and of course Patrick Stewart who beamed down from the Enterprise to become part of another successful franchise. Never blink during this movie - you might miss something. But I can't help but wonder what would be different if they had given Bryan Singer the extra six months he originally had... Maybe that grinding swing around one of Lady Liberty's crown-thorns wouldn't look so... unrealistic.

Naturally, I had to have some things explained to me--like the background or significance of certain characters, or the meaning of certain jokes--like comments pertaining to ""yellow spandex.""
However, I found the film to be fun and entertaining.  I thought the story-line about evolution and the fear and suppression of a group of minorities to be fascinating and significant, and I enjoyed the opening sequence about the WWII concentration camp.
The special effects are superb, and there is enough action to appeal to mainstream audiences.  Never before have I seen a movie that can be simultaneaously appealing to both mianstream audiences and a cult-following group of people.

Patrick Stewart makes the PERFECT Professor X just as Halle Berry makes the Perfect Storm.  Another thing I liked about the movie is that the creators decided to have the X-Men wear black suits instead of the colorful ones that are in the comic books.  This really helped the visual appeal of this movie, because it seemed less like a comic book and more like a movie.  The acting is this movie was suprisingly good as well, Xavier, Rogue, Storm and Magneto did a spectacular job as well as the other characters who are not well known actors (at least not to me.) The special effects in this movie were done perfectly, and were used in the right place at the right time.  Nothing was overdone in this movie.  I guess if I could find one bad thing about this movie is the fact that there were limited characters on each side, the X-Man in this movie were Storm, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Rogue and of course Charles Xavier.

I understand this is a typical summer blockbuster movie, so plot is irrelevant and the fans want explosion and fighting. Fine, if that's what you want, then go for it. In any case, this movie stunk.  The box office also proved my sentiments.  It's NOT a blockbuster if a movie made less than $150 million.  The gross is probably less than 50 million.  That's aweful.  Movie watchers stopped supporting this movie by the 4th week, if not earlier.  This movie appeals to the comic book fan base.  Not much else, I guess.  There's plenty of X-men and Marvel goodies here , but for us normal folks who demand decent acting and a decent plot, this just doesn't deliver.  I blame Mr. Singer for relying on special effects instead of the immense talents of Mckellen and Patrick Stewart.  I guess he's working for the powerful hoards of X-Men fans.",980121600,,1342,4.610169491525424

The actors they picked had astounding resemblences to Marvel's, and they catured the attitudes perfectly. After seeing it once, I went back to the cinema to see it again not 3 hours later, and found that it was as good then as it had been the previous time. X-Men is one of those movies that is good, no matter how many times you see it. Every time, you can pick up hidden jokes, mentions and cameos. The only thing that I now, after seeing the cartoon, find wrong with it, is that they melded together Beast and Jean Grey, and left out everyone's favourite Cajun, Gambit. However, I still give this movie 5 stars because it is just awesome. If you like sci-fi, you'll love this movie, regardless if you have been a Marvel fan for years, or not.

There's nothing I can say about this move that hasn't been said already. It's fantastic, and along with Batman and Superman it's one of the best superhero films ever made.
My only nitpick (and it's a small one) is Michael Kamen's orchestral score. It's totally and utterly forgettable. Shouldn't superhero movies have exciting and thrilling soundtracks? I listened to the end credits, waiting for that rousing theme song...only to find there isn't one.
I think Bryan Singer would be doing everybody a huge favour if he could get someone different to compose the music for the next film. Perhaps Alex Proyas would be a good choice, as his music for the trailers was fantastic.

Going in, I was worried about how this flick was going to be handled.  There have been so many stories surrounding these characters.  THey have died too many times to count, been to other planets, dimensions, even times in history.  Yet, there is a tremendous amount about some of them that had never been addressed.  Naturally there are plenty of pieces that any quasi-fan could point out.  Toad and Mystique's fighting ability, Wolverine/Logan's lack of that berserk edge and a couple of changes to Rouge's character all depart from the long history in the books, yet I find all of this acceptable.  Remember X-Fans, to make this flick, it had to be understandable to all, to have a mass appeal to justify more X-Movies.  I feel numerous little 'inside' jokes are there for us.  I was the only one in the theatre to get the ""yellow spandex"" joke.  But it was there for X-Fans.

Of course if you're talking about the X-Men, you're talking subject matter that is more mature on many levels than most comics books.  The story line goes head on into the racism and fear of mutants, people born with genetic differences that don't surface until they hit puberty and give them never seen before gifts that allow them to do pretty amazing things, some incredibly beautiful, others intensely frightening.  Professor Charles Xavier (perfectly cast and portrayed by Patrick Stewart) is their unsung savior as a wealthy father figure who takes in these young people to try to mold them into something positive.  On the other end of the spectrum is a jaded and bitter Magneto, also portrayed well by Ian McKellen, who believes that normal humans have had their chance and now something has to be done to show them that mutants are superior.  Xavier's Senior students, Cyclops, Jean Gray and Storm help new found mutants Rogue and Wolverine discover who they are and what may lie in the future.  The actions scenes are unique and original.  All the actors give solid performances, especially Jackman, and Halle Berry impressed me with her Kenyan accent.  I hope she speaks more in the sequel.  The DVD is excellent for true fans because it's obvious that Director Brian Singer wanted so much more for this movie but just wasn't allowed to have it.  Time, budget and a last minute search for someone to play Wolverine caused serious constraints.  Considering the obstacles and the bad luck of past comic-book-to-movie adaptations, this one scores high and pleases fans and normal folks alike.

Of course, as a long-time reader, there were a few things I might have done differently, but to each his own creative vision.  Several people who have not read the comic also enjoyed it, which led me to believe that this succeeds in just the right way, reaching beyond those of us who were already fans and engaging the general public.  Handling comic books in the movies is always tricky, trying to stay true to the material, and not seem foolish at the same time.  The right balance was struck with this movie, and I feel I can safely recommend this to anyone who enjoys action movies.
My only hesitation about the DVD is the extra ten minutes of footage.  My guess is that there is better extra footage on the floor of the cutting room, and this doesn't add much to the movie.  The real problem is the way the footage is spliced into the movie.  Luckily, you can turn that option off and watch the movie as it was presented in the theatre, leaving the extra stuff for another time.

1264878,5,B00003CX8I,"No, I'm not talking about some saturday-morning animated special. It's X-Men: The Movie, and it has parallels to our real-life issues of discrimination, racism, and nationalism. You, a concerned, hyper-zealous parent, must be thinking, ""What the--? A super-human comicbook movie adaptation that actually contains useful material for our generation of youngsters?""
That's right, Mrs. Censor. You see, X-Men's plot goes around the premise of a world where certain people are starting to attain magical superhuman abilities because of their genetic predisposition. Because of the way they are born, people begin to fear them and what they can do. Thus, the public gets pees their panties and wants the aforementioned ""freaks"" to be, in one way or another, contained. Any way you cut it, that's discrimination, folks. This is not by any means a shock to readers of the comics (as well as viewers of the animated TV show), since the theme of X-Men has always centered around the ideas of social acceptance and insecurity.
The moral depictions are pretty cool, but what other things are  cool about this movie are the way our heroes (and villians) have their super-powers visualized. I won't spoil them for you right here, but believe me when I say fans of the comicbook will appreciate the innovative effects and stunts that bring the X-Men's ""mutations"" to life on the screen.
This movie has its share of flaws, though. As many comic fans would have predicted, Wolverine gets the lion-share of coverage and development, while characters like Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Gray are underdeveloped. I would've liked to see more of the mentor-pupil relationship between Scott Summers and Professor Xavier that was so evident in the comics. However, Rogue was nicely characterized, subbing in for Jubilee as Logan's dependent friend and companion.
What can I say? The movie is deliciously great, and its low-points mean diddly-squat in the midst of its high-points. It's a comic-book fan's dream. If you like the comics, buy this film.

1264916,4,B00003CX8I,"This Comic book to screen adaptation is one of the best of its type, well cast, well paced, and set up for its first sequel.
I haven't read an X Men comic in at least 25 years--since the 70's. Since then the comic books have become enormously popular, but I've not kept up or knew much about it at all.
I have fond memories of the clever, creative series and it quickly took the place of the mid 60's Superman, Batman, DC Gang comic books. But I grew out of comic books and I've not been overly nostalgic looking back at them. Oh sure I've wandered into comic book collector stores and peaked at a few old issues, stuff I remember having as a kid....
  X MEN
I'm sure not having a strong recollection of any story line and barely recalling some of the characters was a plus in my enjoying the 'surprises' of the film. I found the film wonderfully cast. Patrick Stewart makes a great Professor Xavier. Though Wolverine I understand is basically a dwarf in the comics, I don't think much is lost by having him full sized in the film. Ian McKellan plays a pretty old Magneto (but whow cares? he's having a good time and so are we).
They did a wonderful job with it I thought. At times the film was almost touching, and without slowing down the fast pace of its character introductions, plot mechanics or action.
Unfortunately, when you come to the end you realize the huge hurdle that any of these movies face. You want to end a movie like this, satisfying the audience but leaving them wanting a little more.
Of course there's no mystery about the wanting a little more part. The movie was done well, it will do good box office and so there will of course be a sequel. The lead actors have agreements in place to be in a couple of sequels, though director Singer isn't a sure thing. There will be another X Men movie,probably within a couple years. So the movie isn't exactly complete because unlike a movie where you aren't sure if there will be a sequel or not, you already know not only will the film  continue, it's already in several of the actors contracts. So they don't have to wrap everything up, they can have characters rush off to find themselves and not show us or tell us a thing about it, because there's gonna be a sequel.
I enjoyed the humor, the relationships, the special effects. The darker parts of the story I thought all were well balanced and the film didn't stop dead as we explored some disturbing revelations (as happened in the Batman films for instance). Because of the intelligent script and good acting the film isn't as shallow as most comic books to the screen conversions have been.
The film has some drawbacks. It was pretty much the Wolverine story, and several characters were given short shrift. Halle Berry was given almost nothing to do with her character of Storm. The reaction of the character to situations was also very slow. Berry's casting and performance may be the weakest thing about the film, but the script gave her so little to do it's impossible to determine if she would have been good were the part better written for her.
Some of the wire work stunt scenes were fairly obvious, but I much prefer this style of filmed stunts than CGI. I get a sense real people are doing the action scene and acrobatics at least part of the time, rather than most of it being computer generated.
It was a real drawback that we never see Cyclops and Jean interact as a couple to know how 'special' their relationship is. If we had, the triangle would have worked much better.
Bruce Davison who plays the Senator is usually very enjoyable in whatever he does, and he's quite good here and deserves a mention.
Bryan (Usual Suspects) Singer has directed one of the most  enjoyable, comic book movies I've ever seen and I anticipate many successful sequels (particularly if he agrees to direct another).
Now give me 80 or 90 mil, and a collection of Green Lantern books to refresh my memory and I'll turn it into a great 2 hour and 20 minute movie. C'mon...

1264918,4,B00003CX8I,"I have heard of The X-Men comic books, but that is as far as it goes.  But that would not seem to matter here.  Actually, I would suggest that the X-MEN is directed at the un-initiated.
The setting is the near-future.  Humanity has started it's next stage of evolution and a small percentage are born with ""mutations"".  These mutations empower the every day individual with some special ability.
There is divide in the general population as to how to respond to these ""mutants"" with some calling for registration and legal segregation and others calling for integration.  You would be correct in thinking that the thematic point of X-MEN serves as an allegory on racism.  Indeed, the opening sequence depicting the taking of Jews into a Nazi concentration camp delivers the theme effectively.
The ""hero"" of this flick is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has a second metallic skeleton that allows him to shoot razor sharp talons out of his knuckles.  He is introduced to us through Roque(Anna Paquin), a teenage girl whose mutation causes her to take the life-force from another human at a single touch.  Rogue, running scared from her family and friends, teams up with Wolverine who is making a living as a traveling bare-knuckle fighter.  Together, they are rescued from Magneto(Ian McKellen) and his henchmen Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Toad(Ray Parks), and Sabretooth(Tyler Mane) by the X-Men.
The X-Men are a team of mutants led by Prof. Charles Francis Xavier(Patrick Stewart).  His objective is to teach mutants to control and respect their powers while educating society on the value of mutants.  The overall aim here is for society to accept and integrate mutants.  His old friend and nemesis, Magneto, believes that in order for mutants to survive, they must fight society.  Xaviers team are: Cyclops(James Marsden) who can shoot fire from his eyes, Storm(Halle Berry) who can control the weather, and Dr. Jean Grey(Famke Janssen) who has telepatic powers.
The less experienced Sci-Fi moviegoer may find the detailed stories rather challenging.  The multiple stories and themes that run through this movie are complex yet compelling and - as is always the case with ""pack"" movies - the viewer is often left feeling that they would have liked to known more about each character.
In terms of action, the fight sequences are expertly performed and are very reminiscent of The Phantom Menace's Jedi/Darth Maul fight scene.  Indeed Ray Parks (who played Darth Maul in Episode 1) is given plenty of opportunity to display those same skills again.  The special effects are somewhat muted and serve to enhance the movie rather than to overtake the plot.  I was particularly fond of a scene outside a railway station where Magneto (who can control metal) stops a bullet in front of a policemans forehead and threatens to let it go again.
Overall, the X-MEN is a very good movie packed with plenty of story and enough visuals to keep everyone happy.
Additionally, I am particularly fond of the the DVD box presentation.  The attractive packaging starts to draw you in before you even watch the movie.  A brownie point for Fox there.",978480000,,3142,5.019267822736031

1264920,5,B00003CX8I,"I am -- or was- a really big fan of the X-Men comic books, [had the complete run from January 1980 to January 1995] So I didn't really know what to expect from the X-Men movie. I came away pleasantly impressed.
The acting was top-notch. When I heard that Patrick Stewart was to portray Professor Xavier, I had mixed feelings. I had no doubt that he would do an excellent job in the role, but I was concerned that he might end up being an otherwise excellent actor in a lame movie ( la Sean Connery in ""The Avengers""). I was therefore very pleased to watch the movie and find that wasn't the case with X-Men. Stewart gave a stellar performance, opposite the equally excellent Sir Ian McKellen (""Magneto""). Other good performances were put in by the really splendid Hugh Jackman (""Wolverine""), Anna Paquin (""Rogue""), and Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly).
Turning a comic book into a movie is a dangerous endeavor (again, look no further than ""The Avengers""), but X-Men pulled it off just right. The movie takes itself seriously (but not too seriously), and--from what I've heard--it remains pretty faithful to the existing X-Men story, without alienating the uninitiated. It also makes the viewer think about important issues, such as racism, instead of just being a brainless, explosion-filled, ammo-laden action movie. Yet the action is there, and movie never gets too heavy or preachy on the issues.
Visually, X-Men is stunning, featuring some really slick computer animation, particularly Wolverine's claws and the scene where Xavier uses the mind-machine to find Rogue. The sound and music complimented the on-screen action. The plot and the explanations of the characters' backstories were interesting, and left things wide open for a sequel.
Overall, X-Men is worth your money.",978307200,,1779,5.033898305084746

Oh yeah, and the casting could have been much better....especially for Wolverine....but after all it was a movie, and if it raises interest in X-Men then it did its job.",978307200,,457,4.112359550561798
1264923,5,B00003CX8I,"An avid reader of comics for quite a while in my youth.  the X-Men was one of the titles I rabidly awaited every month.  When rumors started circulating that they were going to make a movie of the comic, I was a bit disappointed.
  Films from comics have not done well in the past, look at the film for ""The Punisher"".  Though the casting was fairly good for that one, it was not as good as it could have been.  Plus the fact that it was a character that was hard to like.  There have been a few more in recent years also that though they were pretty to watch for the special effects, they were hard to watch for the lack of story.
  Picture my amazement when I heard that Bryan Singer would direct the film.  Bryan Singer from ""The Usual Suspects"", and ""Apt Pupil"".  How was he going to make the move from gritty realism to that of a comic book world?
  He didn't have to!  As hard as it is for me to beleive, Bryan made a gritty, realistic, comic book movie, and it is great.  With a little help from the casting , and CGI departments, he made an exceptional film.
  Now we come to the point in the interview where comic fans may be disappointed.  The film does not follow any storyline from the comics, so don't get this expecting ""The Dark Phoenix Saga"" or some other story.  It is totally new.  Don't get me wrong, there are elements from throughout several arcs, but not enough to say that it is any one particular one.
  Still, any movie with a short, mean Canadian with claws that come out of his arms with a ""SNIKT"" sound can't be bad.  Buy it yourself and see.",978220800,9,1570,4.194630872483222

I had zero expectations coming into this flick, except for the fact that I think Patrick Stewart is a terrific actor and that I was about to watch a comic book come to life.  A fine job they did in doing so.  Excellent effects, interesting setup (I've never read the X-men comic, so I have no point of reference as to how the movie may have differed).  All in all a good rental.
By the way, for the person who complained about the dynamic range of the movie, and in doing so, gave it 3 stars, uh, how about taking a few minutes and reading your DVD and Stereo manual.

The first time I bought this movie I took it home, opened it up, and had a hell of a time being careful to remove the DVD from the casing. Whereas most DVD casing has a button you can press to safely the remove the DVD without risk of bending the delicate structure of the disc, this one does not. It's like an ordinary cd case which requires some degree of pulling, but this DVD would not budge with a delicate tug. As a result, the DVD was bent a little and the result was video fragmentation during the first viewing.
I returned X-Men and got a replacement, this time being extra careful to remove the DVD. The first viewing went smoothly, so did the second, but the third?? Well, after I had another mishap of removing the DVD from the casing, I got more fragmentation, albeit was a little less than before. It only occured during one scene.
Now I enjoyed X-Men, I liked the movie a lot, and that's why I bought it. But FOX gets an F on the DVD casing, a horrible design that can do more harm than good.

It is not the best movie ever, necessarily; but it by far exceeds the type of movie it could have been. Rather than bombarding the viewer with cheesy special effects and a mindless plotline, director Brian Singer has effectively created a universe that is surreal, haunting, and enjoyable; much like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and American Beauty. The performances in this movie are moving and the actors play their characters dead on.

So I was a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed this comic-book inspired film, and it has recieved an exceptional treatment on this DVD edition. True, the story is more or less a showcase for the good and evil mutants' various abnormal attributes, but watching it all unfold is admittedly fun. As for the DVD, the picture quality is beautiful, with rich, bold colors and well-detailed dark scenes. There is basically nothing at all about the picture that distracts, which is always a plus for true videophiles! The overall production design on this movie is magnificent and meticulous. As for sound, if you like to be fully immersed in every sound effect, growl from Sabertooth and Wolverine, or flick of Toad's disgusting tongue, you will not be disappointed. Crystal clear, well-defined audio is a hallmark of this disc. My surround speakers can't remember when they've had such fun...well, maybe Gladiator.. The special features are a nice presentation, with the ability to reinsert cut scenes into the actual film being the coolest one. I could have done without the cut-and-paste interview with Bryan Singer, but its nice to at least get badly recorded sound bites of his thoughts than nothing at all. My only ""wish"" for what I think would've been a cool special feature is a detailed featurette of how they turned Rebecca Romjin-Stamos into the shape-shifting mutant Mystique...truly a work of art!",978048000,,1504,4.833333333333333
1264948,4,B00003CX8I,"I actually rented this before I received it as a Christmas gift. I was especially interested in the 10 minutes of additional footage, since I had heard there was far more than that left on the cutting room floor and wanted to see what was put back in.
It was a bit of a disappointment. Although the extra footage is certainly welcome and adds some extra character flavor, it's not in the same aspect ratio as the rest of the movie. In addition, the footage is much darker than the rest of the film, making one wonder why they didn't bother to keep the quality the same as the rest.
There's a feature called ""interactive version"", which basically plays the regular movie and inserts these bonus footage clips into the play stream as it reaches them. I found this a very poor way of doing it, especially because it doesn't overwrite the footage that's duplicated -- you actually end up seeing the same scene twice (once in bonus version, then the theater version). There's also an annoying pause as the DVD jumps from the movie to the bonus clip, then back.
At a time when most other movies with bonus footage are either giving you two versions of the movie (one with, one without) or simply releasing the movie with the extra footage worked in as it was intended, I find it hard to believe that Fox had no interest in doing the same.
The other features, such as Hugh Jackman's screen test, are entertaining, but the real reason I wanted this was the movie itself and the bonus footage. The movie, of course, is still great, but the DVD as a whole is just a little lacking, mainly due to how Fox chose to incorporate the extra footage. This is why I give it four stars instead of five.",978048000,,1683,4.432258064516129
1264949,5,B00003CX8I,"I am so glad ""X-Men"" turned out as good as it did. Bryan Singer is a wonderful director and writer, and I felt he did an excellent job with it. He co-wrote the script along with Tom DeSanto. The cast is perfect for their roles, especially Hugh Jackman. There's so many big-name actors that could've been wrongly-chosen to play Wolvervine, but this Australian actor was born to play Logan. He has the look and everything down. I am so glad Fox didn't make the mistake of getting together a director and production team that would turn the film into a camp-fest, like Warner Bros. let Joel Schumacher do on the hideous ""Batman & Robin"".
The only complaint I had on X-Men was the editing. I read the movie tie-in novel before I saw the movie, and the movie leaves out several things I liked. For instance, the script had scenes showing when Storm and Cyclops first discover their powers. It had the Blackbird Jet appearing in the beginning when they rescue Logan and Rogue, causing it to appear twice. Also some scenes from the book I liked were filmed and then cut, and appear as deleted scenes on the DVD (I'm glad they let you view the movie with the scenes intact). Actually the only cut scenes I miss that much are when Storm is teaching the class (which only snippets of this scene made it into the final cut, being interwoven with a monologue from the Professor), and subsequently when she talks to Rogue after class ends, and the scene where Cyclops asks Logan if he will follow orders in the Ready Room, and gives Logan his uniform. I thought the ""Ready Room"" scene was great because it gave the two characters a scene with just them where they could become friends without any distractions. But other than that, the movie rocks. It has to be the best comic book adaption since Tim Burton's first ""Batman"" in 1989. The DVD release is excellent, as I mentioned, as are most Fox DVD's.",978048000,4,1889,4.526315789473684

The extra 10 minutes of footage were mostly scenes that deserved to be cut (because they were stupid) or were just different versions of the same scenes in the movie.  Hugh Jackman's screen test was not terribly exciting (after watching that I wondered how they knew he'd make a wonderful Wolverine), and I didn't even bother watching any of the other things included (interviews I think).  But even though the extras are not that special, I still recommend buying the movie on DVD- the effects are of course amazing and the movie is a great sci-fi/action movie!",977961600,,662,4.739130434782608

Of course one need look no further than FOX itself for the reason this DVD (and yes, the film itself) doesn't live up to X-pectations.  Fox put X-Men on the fast-track, essentially axing a full six months of post-production work, so the company could have a big summer film.  The fact that Singer and company were able to put together a film as wondrous as this one is X-traordinary enough.  But what is truly X-asperating is the fact that if it hadn't been so rushed, we would have hade an infinitely more pleasing end product.
Well, it would seem FOX did the same thing to us with the DVD version.  They were in such dire need of getting this product on the market in time for ther holidays, they didn't put the love, time and energy into the DVD that it really needed, and that die-hard fans of the source material truly deserved.

When the X-Men movie was announced, I knew that the only person worthy of the Professor X role would be Patrick Stewart.  The other actors/actresses did excellent jobs in their roles, especially Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, who surprised me as Rogue.
While I was impressed with the performances, the villains were kind of weak, especially Sabretooth.  Fans of the comic will know that Sabretooth is a cunning and calculating villain, not the growling imbecile he was portrayed as.  Ray Park was there to draw Star Wars fans hoping for another Darth Maul-performance.  Ian McKellen was excellent as Magneto, especially with Magnus' history shown at the beginning.  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was there purely for eye candy, having only one line in the movie.
The DVD itself had great picture and sound but I was generally disappointed because there was so much that could've been done and I expect a ""collector's"" edition to arrive once they realize the mistake they made.  The only ""extra"" worth watching was the Hugh Jackman screen test with Anna Paquin.  That's why I rated this fun movie as 4 stars.

Hugh Jackman turned out to be a darned good Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are outstanding - as usual.  The interesting thing about X-Men is that it really isn't presented as a Comic Book on the big screen.  It is treated as a serious film, about a serious topic (prejudice and discrimination) rather than just superheroes duking it out.

Not so much by the special effects and the sets (which were pretty spectacular), but by the fact that here was a movie, based on a comic-book series, which actually appealed to adults! In other words, this is the movie which ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" should have been! The director, Bryan Singer, was responsible for ""The Usual Suspects"", which was one of the cleverest movies of the nineties, so it's no surprise that this movie is very enjoyable. Any movie which features the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island as backdrops is already worthy of three stars, as far as I'm concerned!

1264988,5,B00003CX8I,"I was stunned how serious this film brought the comic to life. There also were many quotes and moments that become even better, if you know the comic. I don't think it is a good idea to make movies out of comic books but this time and with one or two Tim Burton movies, too, it worked very well. Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are absolute convincing, justifying every modification made on the character. Even ruce Davison was great and let no doubt about the sincerity of his action occur. The only thing that bothered me a little was that - at least in the german dubbed version of the film - small touch of ""arrogant right hand"" put onto Cyclops but here, too, I think fans of the comic book now better. Although he always said to be no fan of the comic, Bryan Singer seemed to have made a film full of love for the material making that over the top characters like Magneto or Sabretooth appear serious and true. ""X-Men"" stands way above the usual superhero flicks in character and plot development but also doesn't try to look more real through cutting superpowers to a more realistic level. And for the visual expressiveness, seeing someone carrying a tray with glasses of champaign in Wolverine's dream or Professor Xavier graciously standing up from a chair inside Kelly's memories are just two little details of many, where the action movie grows to be art. I surely can't wait to see Beast or Gambit in action but for a sequel it would also be an idea to concentrate more on the characters that are standing on the side line in the first movie like Storm or Cyclops. After all ""X-Men"" is a great piece of film, fun to watch and almost flawless in portraying some of the greatest comic heroes of all times and lets recent superhero flicks like ""Batman & Robin"" look even more hollow than they already are. I hope, their will be more films like ""X-Men"" in the future but I also hope, that Marvel understands that there is a big difference between the movies and the comic books and don't repeat the mistake of letting a film change an already existing comic like they did with ""Blade"".",977702400,2,2121,4.511688311688312
1264989,4,B00003CX8I,"I should start by saying that I am not a reader or collector of the comic, but that may change after seeing this film for the first time.  I was vaguely familiar with some of the characters, but knew nothing of their origins in the comics.  And so, this review is not skewed by certain expectations a fan of the comic would have.
Based on the trailers, I was sure I wasn't going to enjoy this film.  Even after all of the excellent reviews, I wasn't interested enough to pay to see it in the theaters.  I just rented it tonight for the first time and was quite impressed with most of the performances.
Patrick Stewart was made to play the role of Xavier, a mutant with the abilities to control others minds who has opened up a secret school for young mutants.  He commands, or better yet leads his students with compassion.  His heart is obviously in the right place and he's willing to do anything to keep himself and his fellow mutants safe from persecution by us ordinary people that fear them.  Patrick's performance was flawless.
Hugh Jackman truly did steal the show as Wolverine.  He's a deeply complex individual, a man's man you might say.  He comes across as a bigger and scarier Gary Sinise.  Like Sinise, Jackman is able to take an imperfect character and make you sympathize with him.
Ian Mckellen turns in a solid performance as Xavier's former ally and fellow mutant ""Magneto"".  Mckellen is very subtle in his approach, and thus comes across as being very real in this ""unreal"" role.  His character could and probably should have been developed a bit more, but given the time restrictions and the overall story I can forgive that a bit.
Paquin was excellent in her portrayal of Rogue.  Her innocence shines simply through her eyes.  Jansen was also excellent in her portrayal of ""Jean Grey"".
The special effects generally added to the quality of the film.  Some of the fight sequences weren't extremely fluid and Parks was most definitely underused in his role as ""toad"".
The story was quite solid and moved at a good pace.  The dialogue was much better than I was used to with most comic book adaptations.  I was also glad to see that they chose to stray from the comics in terms of wardrobe.

1265034,4,B00003CX8I,"Longtime fans of the Marvel comic series will find Twentieth Century Fox's adaptation of ""X-Men"" to be quite enjoyable and authentic. I was quite enlightened to see how well it mirrors the characters from the age old comic, as well as the glorious array of special effects, set designs and acting talents that all make the movie more intense and surprising.
In a world where differences are frowned upon, evolution begins its course in the creation of mutants, who possess certain physical and emotional powers beyond that of regular humans. Heading a school for the specially gifted citizens is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who himself possesses the power to read peoples' minds. Among his many students are Cyclops (James Marsden), whose eye beams can cause massive destruction, Storm (Halle Berry), who calls upon the natural forces of weather, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who can look into people's minds and uses telekinesis, and newcomers Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose powerful fighting ability is due in part to his razorbalde knuckles, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can steal the power of another mutant simply by her touch. Xavier soon learns that his nemesis, Magneto (Ian McKellan), is planning on using a special machine to convert human beings into mutants, and that he needs Rogue in order to make the machine work to its fullest. This sets in motion the intense action that held childrens' imaginations for so many years as the group of mutants band together to stop the enemy from overpowering the world.
Being a long ago fan of the comic and all the little perks that went with it, I can say that the film is a faithful and magnificent adaptation. Each of the mutant's powers is recreated with terrific authenticity, and it is very exciting to see it for the first time on the big screen in the age of blockbuster special effects. Cameraman Newton Thomas Sigel and special effects supervisor Michael Fink work together wonderfully in bringing things to life the would have proved impossible years ago, and each effect is perfectly seamless.
The acting ability employed for this movie could not have been any better; each actor is perfectly suited to play their character, and each one does masterfully. Patrick Stewart makes for a great Xavier, and this role seems right in line for the longtime Captain of the Enterprize from Star Trek. __ plays Wolverine brilliantly, Janssen is a terrific Jean Grey, Berry does a great job as Storm, and Marsden and Paquin are very credible as Cyclops and Rogue. Each actor looks like the original character, too, which adds a great deal to the momentum of the movie as a whole.
A rousing good time at the movies for people of all ages and fans of the comic series, ""X-Men"" will have you cheering for the good guys and wanting more when the ending comes.",977270400,9,2822,4.88125

There are some changes from the comic book and cartoon series that serious fans may object to, but I thought that in the end they worked out for the better.

This maybe due to the brilliant craftsmanship of director Bryan Singer, who I guess understands fully how people wanted this film to turn out. What made him perfect for the job might have been because he grew up within the years of this comic series' popularity peak. I don't really have to explain what the plot of the movie is, it's plain simple. Mutant baddies, mutant good-guys, showdown. But what curiously caught my attention about this film was the casting that was made for the characters. Everybody seemed so perfect for the roles, especially Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. Of course the others were great but these actors really lit the movie screen.

Our volume was as high as 20 at some points (usually during dialogue), and as low as 8 (during the storm and fight scenes, for example).

1265086,3,B00003CX8I,"X-men was a good movie with good actors, and great special affects. However, several things were missing, that should have been included, especially if a second one is to be made. The first thing being, is that when Rogue first joined the x-men, she already had the ability to fly and had super strength. She got this from absorbing it permanently from Ms. Marble, but the way the story was written I don't see how in a second x-men she will obtain this power. It would also be pointless to make a movie with her in it witout having the power, because it takes away from her character. The second thing that should have been included in the movie, was that when wolverine and sabretooth were first introduced, they did not know who each other was. That's wrong, because when he was being tested on by the government, he knew sabretooth who was also being tested on. This takes away from the movie, the fact that they are rivals. The third thing I think is that the movie should have had more fighting scenes, and the ones that were in the movie should have lasted longer. I also think that Mystique and the other bad mutants, besides magneto, should have had more than 1 line of dialogue, that just wasn't reasonable. Finally, I think that in the fight scenes there should have been more effort to make it group on group battles between the good and bad mutants, rather than the one on one battles that occured. It made it less interesting, and the fight scenes occured slower, like when Wolverine fought Mystique, it seemed like he really wasn't fighting like he should have been since he's fast. These are the things that really would have made the movie great, and I think more fans would have been into it and liked it a lot better.

The final sequence was top knotch and gave me hope for the sequel. I also thought they left out some characters that could have bettered the movie. Gambit should definitly have been in it and Rouge didn't even act like Rouge considering she didn't fly or have super strength. She also looked like she was 15.

1265089,4,B00003CX8I,"Comic book adaptations have a decidedly mixed history, ranging from groundbreaking (e.g. the first Superman) to abysmal (e.g. ""Batman and Robin"").  Movies which try to split the focus among too many characters have fared even worse.  (e.g. the last three Batman movies).  X-Men, going in, was therefore running against long odds.
X-Men is not as good as the first Superman, but that isn't a strike against it.  The first Superman had the advantage of one hero, one villain, and a mythology ingrained in popular consciousness.  However, X-Men certainly far exceeds most of the comic adaptations out there.  Though some have criticized the focus on four characters (Wolverine, Rogue, Magneto and Professor X), a film that tried to flesh out everyone would end up pleasing no one.  The focus was also appropriate because Paquin, McKellen and Stewart clearly have acting chops and bring depth to their performances.  The real surprise was newcomer Jackman, who fully occupies his role as the feral Wolverine.  Wolverine is, for most fans (myself included) the character on who this film would live or die, and Jackman more than lived up to the challenge.  The script, though somewhat thin, did make the right calls overall on what to accept and what to reject in the mythology.  The villain's master plan was a little contrived, but the same could be said of Lex Luthor's master plan in the first ""Superman"" movie.
""X-Men"" is not a deep film and won't show up in the major awards at the Oscars, but it was a very entertaining film that brought the comic book to life.  The big mistake now would be to accede to fan demands for more characters.  I love Nightcrawler as much as anyone, but we need to develop the characters we have.",976579200,,1726,4.829931972789115

However, after purchasing the video and watching it several times I realized that there were several subtleties in the plot that I simply did not catch on that single viewing.  The movie seems to grow on me and gets better with each viewing.
Sure there are places where the action could look a little more realistic (such as when Sabre Tooth goes flying through the air in a perfectly horizontal path after Storm zaps him with a bolt of lightning in the train station scene.)  But then again, immediately after that we see a man jumping around like a Toad and we are reminded that the film was not intended to impress us with its documentary-like realism -- it is supposed to entertain us.  And this it does very well.

I watched this  great mother of a movie on the first day it was released in theaters and I have to say that it really satisfied me. the action somehow made me think of The Matrix (damn good special effects), manifesting something like a true nature to the comix. the movie's plot is no big deal to tell: our world's not only the home of humans, but of mutants as well - gov wonders wheter the mutants are dangerous or not - wheter their skills are dangerous or not.

However, this movie is a wonerful example of modern B-Rate movies.  Not that being a B-Rate movie is bad.  It's just that if you can figure out the entire plot within 45 minutes of movie i'm dissapointed.  The acting isn't exactly inspired, it follows the comic about as well as your grandmother does, and the great comedic moments are chuckle-worthy at best.
However, it has the three major components of a B-Rate flick.  Great action scenes, a script made up by a group of 12-year olds, and good-looking women running around. (Allright, only Rebecca Romjin and Halle Berry, but i'll deal.)
Essentially, do not buy X-Men if you want an involved drama that delves into the souls of each charachter and the things that drive them, etc.  Do buy X-Men if you're looking for a movie you can watch without ever being forced to think about anything more indepth than which X-Man you liked most.",976233600,,1015,4.700564971751413

1265139,5,B00003CX8I,"Where do I begin praising this movie? First and foremost, X-Men is a comic book movie. As a comic book fan, all I'm looking for from this is a good story that is faithful to the series and the characters. While several things changed in the transition from comic page to big screen, all of the characters are very faithful to their roots (with the exception of Toad, who's a pretty lousy character in the comics anyway). The biggest complaint I heard from friends was that ""they mixed up Rogue and Jubilee!"" While this is partially true (Rogue is Jubilee's age and has Jubilee's relationship with Wolverine), it's not entirely true. Rogue is Rogue, not Jubilee. She's a young Rogue, but she is Rogue. That out of the way, all of the changes that were made were done to make a good movie. The demands of comic books and movies are two completely different things, and the folks who made this movie understood that. So they changed the things that had to be changed and left everything else alone. Aside from all that, it's a great movie in its own right as well. No knowledge of the characters or stories from the comic book series is needed to enjoy this movie, which is a terrific action film that, unlike many action films, also features a very talented cast of actors and an extremely skilled director.
PS The extra features on the DVD are great, as well. It contains all of the standard features (trailers, director interview, subtitles, deleted scenes) but also has the ""Mutant Watch"" promotional show from Fox, as well as character designs for two characters not in the film (Beast and the Blob) and a hilarious scene of ""Spider-Man"" (Bryan Singer under the costume) surprising the X-Men just before the big climax.
PPS For those of you who didn't catch it, X-Men creator Stan Lee has a cameo in this movie. He's the hot dog vendor behind Senator Kelly in the beach scene.",976147200,3,1878,4.608955223880597
1265140,3,B00003CX8I,"X-Men could've been the best film of the summer. It's still mostly good,  but it has a bunch of flaws- little lapses in direction- that, combined,  hurt the film. In other words, this film is pretty good, but by no means  great.
For a comic-book adaptation or any action film, the story is exceptionally  smart and clever. There are a number of clever little details which  combine to make a very convincing setting. For example, Xavier's school is  just like a regular school, and its students have their own quirks (like  when a boy uses teleportation in a basketball game and the other kids  yell ""Hey, no fair! We said no powers!""). The  allusions to racial and ethnic tensions in our own world are apparent in  the persecution of mutants, the McCarthyism of Sen. Kelly, and the  opposing philosophies of Magneto (Malcolm X) and Prof. Xavier (MLK, Jr.).  I like how the two were friends yet separated by principle. All the  conversation scenes with them are clever and entertaining; we can tell  that these two people have known each other for a long time and are aware  of each other's nuances and behaviors. And, even though it consisted  mostly of innuendo jokes, the love triangle between Logan, Cyclops, and  Jean Grey provides nice tension among the X-Men.
The characterizations are well-done. The opening scene, of a concentration  camp, is in exact contrast to what one would expect from a comic-book  action film, and the tone of it (hopeless, desperate, isolated, angry,  dark) sets the stage for the themes about to be presented in the movie  later on. It creates understanding for Magneto, and a human connection to  the mutant. The superheroes in this film are not perfect and happy; the  film not only shows us how they suffer and have their own inner conflicts,  but also portrays the responsibilities and risks each of their superpowers  entails. (Like when Rogue asks Logan, ""Does it hurt when they come out?""  and he answers, ""Every time."") This is a serious, realistic superhero  film. There's almost no parody or self-mockery of the characters that  would be used to ""lighten things up."" That's very refreshing.
But X-Men has its flaws, which end up showing why it can be called pretty  good, but not great. First of all, the story. By itself, the story for X- Men is great, in theory at least. But in the context of the film, it's  not. Its weakness comes from its application. It's simply given way too  much time in the film. Because it's blown all out of proportion, it loses  its effect by being stretched too far. It should've been secondary to the  most important element: the action. If it were compressed more, the effect  would've been magnified and it would've worked a lot better. X-Men's story  is good, but not good enough to survive being given as much screen time as  it was. It becomes tedious. It takes up so much, the action only has about 15 minutes to  develop. This is a result of a script that still needed work, and some bad  editing.
Secondly, X-Men is a little weak in its visual aspect, and doesn't have a  lot of imagination put into it. The sets, effects, and detail simply  aren't well thought-out or original enough to be called great. If you want  to see a truly visual film, watch Gladiator (definitely the best film of the summer), which has wonderful, diverse  sets, with minute detail packed into every scene and setting. X-Men has  nothing special like this. And the costumes (except Mystique's) look like they were bought at some cheap Halloween outfit store.
Finally, the third weakness X-Men has is, unfortunately, the most  important aspect: the action. Although director Bryan Singer did a good  job overall with X-Men, his direction at times could be summed up in one  word: lazy. He lets the story get expanded to insane lengths, and one can  so obviously tell he's a novice at action. The action scenes are  undeveloped (with only about 15 minutes net screen time, it's no wonder);  the mutants' powers are never really taken advantage of (Toad, one of the  best, appearing for a whopping 5 minutes, 2 1/2 minutes of which he spent  fighting with his tongue, which is just stupid). The action has a poorly- made, hokey quality about it; besides the flaws I just mentioned, the wire  work is awful: whenever someone is thrown or blown away by an impact of  some sort, they fly across the room completely horizontally, as if they're  on a trolley. And during the Wolverine vs. Mystique fight (the best part  of the film), the martial arts are sluggish and the actors seem to be  slowing down for each other's benefit, so that they'd get all the moves  down. Whenever Mystique kicks or flips, it looked awkward and forced-  again, the poor wire work. Not to mention that this looks like a ripoff of  an action scene from The Matrix, only slower.
You won't be sorry seeing X-Men, but it isn't anything special. Go see (or  see again, or buy) Gladiator, the best film of the summer, or The Matrix,  or The Phantom Menace, all excellent examples of how an action film should  be done. This is still a good film. I am giving it three stars, after all. I applaud  Singer for actually making a smart, clever comic-book adaptation. But if  there will be a sequel, I hope another director is attached to it, one who  can truly take advantage of the potential this material has.",976060800,10,5335,4.679956896551724

OK - so maybe this film doesn't carry the impact of ""Superman"", nor the stylish slick of ""Batman""; however - this is a better film.

1265185,4,B00003CX8I,"The special effects are good, as is the underlying concept, the mutation that makes them superheroes also makes them outcasts. But the storyline is somewhat simple. What really holds this film together are four great performances.
Hugh Jackman is perfect as the powerful Wolverine, the loner who only joins the X-men so as to save his beloved Rogue.  Oscar winner Anna Paquin is beautiful and heartbreaking as the tragic Rogue, denied the ability to ever touch anyone without killing them. Paquin and Jackman's scenes together are truly touching.  And Patrick Stewart's verbal duels with Ian McKellen are masterful. This is actually a very intelligent film. Not great art, but definitely great fun.

1265186,4,B00003CX8I,"Though highly imaginative with astounding visual effects, ""X-Men"" explodes onto celluloid much the same way as most of the other comic book films, with a weak and predictable plot and characters as two dimensional as their paper counterparts.  This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it is.  It is very high on filmmaking ""coolness"" and the action is intense and impressive.  However, it suffers from excessive form and very little substance.
The science in this so-called science fiction story is laughable.  If we are to accept the premise presented here, suddenly, over a period of about 50 years, man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants.  There is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations; it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution.  Well, evolution doesn't work that way, not even close.  Major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species.  So the concept is really more fantasy than science fiction.
""Lighten up"", you say.  ""Who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway?  It is just an awesome movie!""  That's a good point.  However, even fantasy films need a plot.  ""X-Men"" trots out the same tired storyline; good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on.  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the story.
The film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants.  However, the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not vice-versa as depicted here.  Feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them.  They have the power.  How much sympathy can we have for them?
At the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned e-mail, I have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was.  This film was all sizzle and no steak.  There was only one character with a shred of substance and that was Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  The rest were just cardboard cutouts.
In 1995, at the age of 29, wunderkind director Bryan Singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called ""The Usual Suspects"".  He then burst into flames with ""Apt Pupil"", a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly Nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the U.S.  After that disaster, he went underground until ""X-Men"".  This film showed that Singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick, but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of ""Suspects"".  That film showed that he has a certain directorial genius, but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative, but shallow projects like this.
The acting; well, there wasn't much acting to be done.  Anna Pacquin and Hugh Jackman had the only parts that weren't utterly superficial.  Both of them did a good job, actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor, and she said all six of her lines like a true professional.
I'm being overly hard on the film.  It wasn't bad.  It was very enjoyable.  It just didn't deserve the raves that were doted on it.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences.  These areas were an easy 10/10.  The screenplay was about a 3/10.  It's definitely worth seeing, but leave your brain at the door.",975888000,,3844,4.834609494640122
1265187,3,B00003CX8I,"The X men is a widely popular serial comic that has been around for years.  This film brings the comic to life on the big screen with the story of how the four X men, mutants with special physical powers, are brought together to help mankind under the kindly guidance of Professor X.  They do this against the backdrop of reactionary America, which does not understand their mutations and fears their powers.  Faced off against the X men is the Brotherhood of Mutants, lead by Magneto who wants to make humans an extinct link in the evolutionary chain.
Although I am not a big comic series fan, I watched this film with a group of die hard X men fans.  Each of them badly wanted this film to be fantastic and were a little disappointed.  Although I'll bet they would have rated it higher than a two, it certainly wouldn't have been a five for any of them.  If you are not a fan of the series, the X men movie has some interesting special effects and does not require knowledge of the comic books to understand the plot.
However, because the movie had to play to both fans and non fans, I believe some of the depth in the characters were lost.  The shallow treatment of all the characters other than Wolverine, coupled with very weak performances from Halle Berry (Storm), served to blunt the intensity necessary for any action movie.  Fortunately, the on screen chemistry between Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Famke Janssen (Dr. Gray) helped interject some humor into the film and Jackman's performance through out the film is strong.
Out of all the villans that have graced the pages of the X men, I wish that they had chosen more interesting ones than Toad and Sabertooth.  Sabertooth is just a WCW wrestling character without any particularly impressive powers and the Toad character was a tad silly.  Mystique was the only truly interesting bad guy (bad person?) and has one of the best special effects scenes in the movie as she transforms in mid kick.  Finally, Ian McKellan does a great job as an arch villain, so why dress him up in a silly looking cap?
There were some interesting special effects in this show but I think that bad directing also blunted some of their impact.  The pace of the film is slightly off and never develops a really real adrenaline rush that it could have inspired.  The fight scenes are particularly weak, I wish that they had spent more time teaching the actors how to fight and then found more exciting ways to show the fights - they should have been realistic (ala Matrix) versus the WWF wrestling (aka fake) style used in the film.
The DVD extras are terrible.  Besides a few rather interesting easter eggs, the deleted scenes add nothing to the movie (unless you want to hear Halle Berry with the worst fake accent since Kevin Costner tried to be english in Robin Hood).  The mutant watch special is just an extended commerical for a film you have already seen.
Finally, the DVD sound quality is ok but the picture quality is not great.  In a couple of places, the DVD pauses longer than it should and in one or two places, there is visible image distortion that it not an intentional special effect.
Overall, this movie was ok but given the material it should have been fantastic.",975888000,,3221,4.575652173913044
1265188,4,B00003CX8I,"As adaptations of comic books go, this is about as good as it gets: the effects are terrific, the tone is humorous at times and deadly serious at others (yet never campy), the acting is mostly solid (at times spectacular, in the cases of jackman, Stewart and McKellan), and it plays mostly like an adaptation of a great X-Men comic book that never existed.
That being said, there is a certain silliness to it that non-comic book fans may have trouble getting past: Magneto's plan is needlessly complex, there are too many characters to keep track of, and Professor Xavier's Cerebro machine seems absurd. (Although the latter requires a mutant telepath to use it--with incredible danger involved--, in the film it tells you only the most obvious information imaginable: ""She's trying to escape by going to the peculiarly large train station just miles from here even though we live in the middle of nowhere! We never would have figured that one out without Cerebro!"") Nevertheless, it's hard to imagine a better Professor X, a better Wolverine, or a better film adaptation of the popular comic book.",975888000,,1098,4.908602150537634
1265189,3,B00003CX8I,"The film is not without it's merits. Hugh Jenkman is intense though I could not help thinking that Australia now has the new export -  glowering actors with hair-framed faces, the wounded guys ready to burst out in rage. Doesn't he remind you of Russell Crowe's gladiator?
I was happy to see Ray Park's face for the first time - without Darth Maul's warpaint and The Horseman's headlessness. His Toad is a funny, quirky  creature. Delicious Rebecca Romjin-Stamos having her revenge on the world for having to wear that weird makeup.
The scene when the guns hang in the air aiming at their masters' foreheads is also very impressive and looks fresh.
BUT!
A few things just do not make sense. Wolverine catches up with the Rogue (who, by the way, does not look or act like rogue) in the train, they decide to give it another try and go back to the school -  then the wheels turn and they just sit, letting the train take them where the girl planned to go, as far from the mutant academy as possible.
And that's not the only lapse of reason in the movie.
What's more important is the production design. It seems that Bryan Singer could not decide what kind of comics-based movie he intends to make. The opening Holocaust scene made me feel I am watching the modern fairy tale of the new kind, something serious, and the cartoon evil echoes the terror of the human history.
But nearly an hour passes and I see that tragic and bitter survivor dressed like a county fair magician. All the laughable clichs in superhero's attire resurface.  His ""mind-impulse-proof"" headgear looks exactly like a boxer's helmet, hastily acquired in the nearest sports equipment shop. And if that thing can block the rival's impulses how come Magneto's brainwaves stream out unhindered?
In Batman movies the Gotham City is very stylized and the characters' outfits does not look out of place. In Blade the city and the interiors are very modern and hi-tech - so even the vampires are dressed as a club-going crowd. And that does not make them look less menacing.
When we see provincial America and the very unromantic places like Northern Alberta, the appearance of leather-clad cloaked clowns looks weird. The scenes are not stylized or not stylized enough.  Magneto and his cohorts marching down the railway station stairs is the perfect picture of the freak parade.
The accents are unbalanced. We have the realistically shot reminder of the WW II genocide at the movie's start and at the end - the ultimate comic-book messing with the Statue of Liberty. Is that the testimony of the unease Bryan Singer felt as a ""serious"" director venturing into the territory of the purely commercial cinema?
Of course any addition to the superhero cinematography is guaranteed a well-funded promotional campaign, an impressive official site and the merchandise that usually brings a large percentage of the film's profit. And the film has to be a total flop to leave the viewers with a definite feeling of disappointment. Even the deeply flawed movies ride a hypewave to the public appreciation.
X-men is far from being a flop, but the promise of the opening scenes is left unfulfilled. The stylish and modern entertainment degenerates into the All-American World Saving Blast'Em To Hell.",975888000,,3252,4.841726618705036
1265190,4,B00003CX8I,"In the world of movies, profundity often creeps up in the most unexpected and unlikely of places.  Let's face it; one does not instinctively turn to the super-hero genre if one is searching for films with great thematic meaning and philosophical depth.  Yet, ""X-Men"" provides just those qualities in the context of a thought provoking, intelligently written and superbly executed tale of ""mutants"" searching for acceptance, tolerance and affirmation in a world filled with frightened and often even hostile inhabitants.
Much more than just a mere action film, ""X- Men"" broadens into a study of the effects of prejudice, done in almost allegorical terms.  Often when a theme has become played out through over exposure, it takes a fresh approach to make it come alive again.  Yet another movie chronicling the injustices done to blacks, Native Americans, Jews, gays, the handicapped and a host of other routinely aggrieved groups probably would not have the same impact as this film does.  By creating an entirely fictional group to serve as the target of intolerance, the filmmakers allow us see the issue from a novel perspective, stripped down to its barest essentials as it were.  Since none of us brings to the film an innate prejudice against a group that doesn't exist in real life, we are all free to see the irrationality, fear and idiocy that serve as the basis for bigotry in any of its forms.  How many movies of any genre can one say THAT about?
The film begins, appropriately, with a scene recreating a factual example of bigotry in one of its most recent and darkest forms - as a family of Jews in 1944 Poland is marched to its doom in a Nazi concentration camp.  We discover later on that the young lad has survived the experience and that he is actually one of the first of a new breed of ""mutants"" being caused by a sudden leap in the human evolutionary cycle.  It seems that these mutants begin manifesting their various differences around the time of puberty, and that as the 21st Century progresses and more and more of these special people begin to reveal themselves, the world finds itself grappling with the issue of whether or not they should be denied equal rights and equal citizenship and even whether or not they should be allowed to remain integrated with the rest of society.  In many ways, I imagine that this film speaks with particular significance to the gay community, since in contemporary terms, that seems to be the group most often targeted with the kind of ignorant, vitriolic claptrap we hear coming from the outraged ""normal"" citizens and opportunistic politicians in the film.  The X-Men are a group of mutants (women included, by the way) with super-human powers whose twofold mission it is to prevent the world's lawmakers from passing legislation against them and to simultaneously fight off some renegade mutants who have decided to take matters into their own, less diplomatic hands.  Kudos to writer David Hayder and director Bryan Singer for daring to explore such a profound theme in such an entertaining format.
For make no mistake about it:  ""X-Men,"" for all its profundity and thematic richness, is, first and foremost, a stylish and enthralling comic book action thriller.  Even though the mutant heroes are essentially two-dimensional characters, at least they don't undercut the seriousness of their purpose by indulging in the customary wisecracking, adolescent antics that have diminished so many earlier super hero characters in previous films of this nature.  Most impressive is that the ""villain"" possesses not only a credible motive for his actions, but even the seeds of some long dormant goodness that allow for the possibility of his redemption somewhere down the road.  (And it is indeed obvious that this film provides a dandy setup for a potentially lucrative series of films to follow).  The first-rate action stunt sequences and state-of-the-art special effects contribute greatly to the entertainment level of the film.  Of the actors, the standout is Patrick Stewart who, as the mutant dedicated to building a bridge of tolerance and understanding between the mutants and the outside world, brings just the right note of comforting civility and rationality to the role.
Yet, for all its technical virtues as an action film, it is the depth and breadth of its vision that separates ""X-Men"" from so many other films of its genre and makes it truly worthwhile viewing.

1265263,5,B00003CX8I,"X-Men Mega-Review  BY: JAMES GOULD
 While there are many who are quick to point out all the things that director Bryan Singer could have done better, there aren't many people discussing all the things that he did right, or tried to anyway.  The movie's success (54.7 million in its first week) is based on the fact of word of mouth.  If people who saw the movie the Friday it opened, saw it and didn't like it, they wouldn't tell other people about it, or if someone brought the subject up, they would simply say don't see it, it was really bad.  X-Men, however, was a good movie, not only working in comic book heroes to life, but also working in a plot, theme, and the difficult and risky process of working major character backgrounds into the story-line.
 Some may say that the success of the movie was only due to the idea of a comic book being brought to life.  This wasn't the case for X-Men, because it involved so much more than just comic book heroes fighting.  The plot to X-Men dealt with many of the original X-Men from the comic book - Cyclops, Storm, Jean-Grey, Rouge, Magneto, Professor X, Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth.  With this many main characters, it is completely impossible to work in histories of each character for 90 minutes of film.  For those who are avid fans of X-Men a history isn't needed, but Singer needed to address regular average movie-goers with no knowledge of X-Men.  It was a good touch at the beginning to introduce Magneto being separated from his parents in Poland in 1944, and then it went to Rouge kissing a boy - only to send him into a coma.  These two histories were introduced well, along with Wolverine and Professor X's history.  Storm, Cyclops, Jean-Grey, Mystique, and Toad were the only ones that people didn't really know about, but their  histories will probably be discussed in sequels to the movie.
 Also dealing with the history of the X-Men was the brand new plot that Singer had to make up, because those who were fans of X-Men before wouldn't have wanted to see the same type of story all over again.  He did a good job with developing Magneto's hatred of humans into a take over plot.  The X-Men obviously try to stop Magneto and then that's where the fight scenes occur which were pretty well done for only a $70 million dollar budget.  Factor in major actors who need major money for their acting, special effects, expensive set designs, costumes, it all adds up leaving very little money to spend on one thing.  So overall the fight scenes weren't as spectacular as I would have liked, but Singer did a good job.  There were about 3 fight scenes in the movie, not as much as I hoped for, but the action was intense enough to keep me at the edge of my seat.  There is the classic one liner that is said by Storm that everyone will remember from this movie.  It is said when Storm explodes the doors of an elevator off with bolts of lightning (Toad had trapped her down there).  She says, ""You know what happens when a toad gets struck by lightning...the same thing that happens to everything else.""  That's when her eyes go white and lightning comes down on Toad and shocks him off of the Statue of Liberty.  Very cool special effects in that scene.
 Also lying in the movie was the theme of acceptance that was very wisely put in the movie.  The idea of mutants is that they are outcasts to society that are persecuted by ""normal"" humans, because they are the minority.  Tolerance is what people today are trying to accomplish and X-Men personified this action perfectly by showing how mutants are ""hated"" members of society.  It was a nice touch that I am glad that Singer included, showing that the movie had heart along with the fighting.
 Overall, Singer did an excellent job, and I think that he deserves credit because of all the things that he did do right, instead of scrutinizing him for things that he could have done better.  Face it, to any stuffy, snobby, ""genius"" movie critic, no movie is perfect, but even they say that the movie did do a great job of bringing the comic book to life.  What is most important is that the fans of X-Men and non-fans alike enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  I rate this movie a 4  stars out of 5.  You should definitely buy the movie and the DVD because of the chance to take the magic home, and enjoy 10 extra minutes of footage that wasn't included in the movie that was released in movie theaters.",975456000,6,4412,4.493099121706399

I expected a lot more from Singer.  The ""fried toad"" line could have been hilarious if it had been properly directed - Halle is a pretty good actress when the director is paying attention.  The same could be said for many of the actors in this movie. Regarding the DVD edition - first of all, it's pretty much a given that any new action movie will have impeccable sound production.  So why do so many people rave about the sound quality in every single DVD review?  We already know that the bar for technical quality has been raised from the VHS standard.  Let's try and get over it...  Second, the widescreen ratio of 2.35:1 has a horrible effect on most TVs.  Why couldn't we have this in 1.85:1 so we don't feel like we're watching 1950's TV sets?

1265316,5,B00003CX8I,"As far as big screen adaptations of comic books go, so many in the past have come up short, such is not the case with Fox's 2000 release of ""X-Men."" Besides the first ""Batman"" film, ""X-Men"" is the best film adaptation of a successful comic book series. It works in all the right ways, ways in which past Marvel Comics features have failed, i.e. ""Captain America,"" ""The Punisher,"" and the ""Spider-Man"" television show.
First of all, they got a budget and a studio with some money. In order to do the X-Men justice, as is the same for any comic book come-to-life, there is a need for big bucks to pull the special effects off and create a believable world in which these characters live.
Second, they got an excellent motion picture director behind the project, Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil). Instead of a monkey that could hold a camera to direct, they got someone with an eye for the feel of how the X-Men should come to the screen.
Third, and one of the most important points, they stayed true to the characters. Sure, some things were changed around (like the absence of Beast, Iceman as a teenager, and Rogue taking on a younger role as the Kitty Pride/Jubilee part), but the characters as a whole remained honest to the ones that die hard fans have loved for 30-plus years. I myself read the multiple X-Men series for years and found that the slight changes were not nearly enough for me to enjoy this film any less than I did. Sure, the costumes were modified, but wouldn't yellow spandex have looked a little odd?
Those in charge of casting did an excellent job, as well. Since filming on ""Mission: Impossible 2"" ran late, Dougray Scott had to leave the role of Wolverine, which went to Hugh Jackman, who did a terrific job. Had this movie been made 15 years ago or so, I personally think Mel Gibson would have made a perfect Wolverine, back during his crazy days, fresh from ""The Road Warrior"" and the first ""Lethal Weapon."" However, the special effects would have suffered and it was very worth the wait. Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Tyler Mane, Bruce Davison, and, yes, even Halle Berry were all good choices in their roles, as well. The only thing I might have changed would have been Charlize Theron as Rogue (she had a pretty convincing accent as a Southern Belle in ""The Devil's Advocate"") in place of Anna Paquin, but that's just a minor detail.
I look forward to the future; the establishment of a successful and excellently produced series has been made with ""X-Men."" The actors and director have been signed, or are now in talks to sign on, for the coming sequel(s).
I loved reading the comics and I loved seeing those heroes I had only read about finally take their place on the silver screen, in such gallant fashion.

We now have a remedy for that.  Its' name is X-Men.  I have to say that I am a pretty big fan of this comic and I was blown away by this film.  I loved the little things that were shown in the film like the love triangle between Wolverine, Jean Grey, and Cyclops.  There were numerous other little things as well.  My favorite character in the movie would be Cyclops, portrayed by James Mardsen.  He pulls off the stick in the mud character that Cyclops truly is.  But the rest of the stellar cast brings every character to life.  The best item about this movie is that the story was so true to the comic.  And we have no one else to thank for this but Bryan Singer.  He made every X-Fan's dream come true. The additional ten minutes of footage on the dvd really should  have been included in the actual movie.  It gives us glimpses of cameo appearances and other little things that would have added to the movie rather than take away from it. All in all, this is a definate must by for anyone who either loves the comic or just enjoys a good Sci-Fi movie with a good story.",975283200,,1235,4.317391304347826
1265318,4,B00003CX8I,"When I read in Premier Magazine that ""X-Men"" was going to the big screen live (as opposed to animation),  I was hopeful, skeptical and worried.  I liked the fact that Patrick Stewart was going to  play Professor Xavier; I couldn't imagine anyone else, in fact.
But I'm Canadian.  Like Wolverine.  So I, like many other Canadians who also happen to love the X-Men, have a sort of personal interest in any changes that may be made to the Wolverine character--including going live.
Having stewed about this very fact for many months between magazine announcement and actual viewing, I found myself in a decidedly cynical attitude as the lights dimmed and the movie started.
I confess I didn't really pay a great deal of attention to the movie until Hugh Jackman came on screen.  As they introduced the character of Wolverine I found myself thinking, O.K., not bad, not bad, certainly not horrible...
By the end of the movie I was in love.  Hugh Jackman managed to convey the quintessential coolness that has always been Wolverine.  I was so relieved!  The rest of the cast wasn't too bad either; I was particularly impressed with Ian McKellen's portrayal of Magneto, since the comics display him as a powerfully built villain.  McKellen was every bit as powerful as the comic character without the build; that, my friends, is acting.
Also impressive was Ray Park's Toad.  I would have liked to have seen more of that character in the movie.  The story of how Rogue got that streak of white in her hair was also good, and I thought Halle Berry did quite a good job with Storm.
I think it's pretty much a given that we will see more ""X-Men"" movies--several more, I hope.  But the most important thing is that they got Wolverine right.  Thank-you, Hollywood!  This Canadian is grateful and relieved.
Incidentally, I feel anyone who enjoyed ""The Matrix"" or the Batman movies will really like this one.

1265319,4,B00003CX8I,"This movie kept my eyes glued to the screen when I first saw it at the theater (openning night).  All the characters were well done and brought to life by a well picked cast.  All the actors fit their roles so well, you could almost believe they were accually the characters.  Hugh Jackman did an excellent job as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart (like always) produces an excellent performance as Professor Xavier.  I know there are some net pickers out there that are saying that the film wasn't true to the characters in the comics.  Well, tough.  There are going to be some compromises when you try to bring a comic book with character such as the X-Men to life on the big screen.  Regardless of anything that was left out from the comics, I think this movie does fine with what it has.  This movie is perfect for a starting point to what will hopefully be an X-Men saga if not a trilogy.  Become one of the X-Men and get this must have movie.",975283200,,944,4.379310344827586
1265320,5,B00003CX8I,"I loved this movie.  The story was kept very simple and did not try to over explain itself or over work itself. A few things were left out or changed from the comics but ultimately they are changes I can live with. I am referring to things like Wolverine & Sabertooth not knowing each other that fact that Rouge and Jubilee were more or less morphed into one character.  I loved the inside jokes (the students), the Easter Eggs on the DVD are great!  Especially the outtake with an unexpected visitor.  :)  I won't spoil the surprise if you don't know, but all you have to do is go to the TV Spots part and highlight the rose and OK it or whatever, let 'er rip.  I about busted a gut let me tell you. The other Easter Egg is the in the Art Gallery and displays artwork for characters not used in this movie, but perhaps the sequel. I can say enough about it, Patrick Stewart man, that's a whole conversation right there.  He NAILED Professor X in my mind.  Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, in fact, I think all the actors pretty much nailed there characters. I think the reason I like it so much was like I said it was kept simple.  They didn't try and do too much, and you weren't bombared with all this information that only really makes sense to fans like me.  Outstanding!!  I cannot WAIT for the sequel, Bryan Singer's back on board and as far as I know, all the actors have said yes to one.  The seriousness is another factor.  I mean, the story, for being so out there is treated very seriously.  No goofy off the wall crap.  Oh, BTW, the deleted scenes aren't all that, but they rarely are (hence why they were cut out of the film) but there is one between Jean Grey and Professor X while they're talking about Wolverine that I liked quite a bit.  Still it didn't hurt the movie and kept the pace up.  Rent this movie and then when you can't stand it BUY IT! I saw this movie on opening and day and was waiting for the DVD with baited breath and was not disappointed at all.

for this edition, the sound/video transfer are great! the inclusion of the trailers/tv spots were a nice touch, and the deleted scenes were good, but didn't reveal alot of what was REALLY cut from the film. i wish there were commentaries for the deleted scenes.
the featureatte was nothing special since this was what was shown on tv and most ppl i would assume have already seen it. it was a nice extra touch to include though.
the excerpts from singer form the ""rose show"" were too short. i wish they could have included the entire hour interview. i am not sure why they cut it.
it was interesting to see jackman's screen test, but it didn't really reveal anything more than just a test that was put there for hugh jackman fans.
lots of photos in the still gallery, but none of rogue and missing a few other characters. some images seems to repeat, although i did like the slideshow running itself.

1265323,4,B00003CX8I,"Fox has given this one another of their superior DVD treatments. Primary among the extras are the deleted scenes. Usually, you can understand why scenes were exiled. In this case, it makes you wonder what director Brian Singer was thinking. Most of the material that was cut helps explain the character motivations beyond anything that had previously been seen. The relationship between Jean Grey and Wolverine actually gets some meaning to it. It helps delve into Rogue's mind a bit more as well.
The movie itself is curiously involving despite it's shortcomings. Is it great, no. The special effects are though. The performances, for the most part, are very good. And, it rarely falls below good. Best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Now, if only Anna Paquin could decide if she's going to actually have an accent through the whole movie (No Kevin Costner jokes.)",975283200,9,879,4.945945945945946

The good news is that Director Singer does a masterful job of delicating choosing his ""juicy bits"" from the comic book series and constructing a movie which is enjoyable whether you're like me... or my wife.
The only fault I can find is that Singer leaves us with a cliff-hanger of Empire Strikes Back proportions which leaves the casual view feeling unsatisfied... or like they only got half a movie.  Of course, the cliff-hanger does leave the promise of a sequel and, again, Singer carefully alluding to many different plots he might address in an upcoming film.

Little is done to explore any of the characters personalities (except for Rogue) outside of 'how does this person feel about Wolverine'. I'm still trying to block out Halle Berry's silly wig from my mind, and the less said about the 'kewl' Ray Parks, the better...

The X-men are a group of assembled mutants formed by Professor Charles Xavier(Stewart). Xavier's ultimate fantasy is for humans and mutants to live side by side in peace. Xavier's former colleague, Magneto,(McKellan) has a diferent outlook on things. Magneto thinks mutants should rule over humans in turn he beleives this will insure peace.
Senator Kellye is a rights activist trying to enslave or completly do away with mutants. As a test Magneto captures Kellye and turns him into a mutant using some kind of generator to produce a ionic wave of magnetism. His ulitmate goal is to transform all the world leaders into mutants just as he did to Kellye. Little does he know that this process has longterm affects which eventually kill you.
How does this tie into the X-men????
Wolverine(Jackman) is a former Canadian super agent. He lives his life traveling through Canada boxing his way around.
Rogue is a terrified girl because she nearly killed her boyfriend by draining his energy accidently. She flees from home and goes to Canada where she meets Wolverine.

I originally saw X-men in the theater with non-comic book reading friends, and by their reaction, it apparently has some apeal for those not familiar with the book. Being familiar with the comic, I found the in-jokes and comic references more enjoyable than the actual plot.
There is a mixture of really clever special effects with very-sub par special effects (in particular any time the computer generated jet is on screen is just really painful).
If I were rating the movie alone, I'd probably give it a 3-3.5 but the DVD is very nicely put together so its a definate 4. The deleted scenes, trailers and other extras make it a definate contender for any extensive collection and the mastering of the sound is simply wonderful. One of the best non-DTS sound jobs I've heard in a while.

I wish they just could have battled each other all movie.  Still there was ample action and fantastic FX.  This is a great looking film on DVD and has some really cool extras like Hugh Jackman's screen test and some cool stills.

Everything about this movie is perfect!  Not only is it filled with action, but the character development is incredible, the plot is totally believable (unlike those ridiculous Batman films) and at times it is comical and even heart-warming.  Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) is amazing!  He's almost more like Wolverine than the actual comic Wolverine.  His scenes with Rogue (Anna Paquin) are so touching, and some of my favorites of the movie.  Patrick Stewart was *born* to play Professor X and James Mardsen (Cyclops) and Famke Jannsen (Jean Grey) also make the roles their own.

The costuming is trite and doesn't measure up even to the level of Saturday cartoons.  The plot line was tiresome to say the least, with multiple set ups to introduce the characters.  Plleese folks, edit the thing again to tighten it up.  Not even the gifted actors, Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart, could make this movie anything more than a cardboard cut out of a great comic book series.
One has to feel sorry for poor Tyler Mane, Sabertooth and Anna Paquin,Rogue.  At least Ray Park, Toad, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Mystique, were able to do a little acting and have some fun at the same time. Mr. Mane's only challenge was to look mean and roar occasionally and Ms. Paquin's was only allowed to look timid or frightened.
No, I didn't like the movie, but so what.  I give it 3 stars, cause it's a good family film which can be enjoyed by a range of ages.

The film could have been longer, though, and it tends to focus on Wolverine and Rogue too much. Storm,Cyclops,and Jean Grey ( Phoenix ) take second saddle, hopefully not next time. Magneto is well portrayed and so is Professor X. The action scenes are convincing, the plot is a bit too political, and the X-Men are sans-outfits, all dressed in black. Hugh Jackman is a great Wolverine. My main complaint is the focus on Rogue. She was originally a member of the Evil Mutants, though not in this film. She was also a much lesser X-Man, and in my opinion she should have been absent in favor of Beast, Colossus or Nightcrawler. I think she was given so much just to pander to the the teenage girls.

Of course, I have been an X-Men fan since I was 3 years old and have been waiting ever since I can remember for a movie about the X-Men to come out.  I was skeptical about the movie at first seeing the quality of other comic book movies, but this movie is a masterpiece.  The actors portray their roles well, the special effects are very nice, and the overall translation from comic to movie was pretty near perfect.  Perfectionists will be critical about the way Singer presented the origins of some of the characters since they are not completely on spot with the comics, and true sticklers for detail may be disappointed with the costumes.  I think it would have been a mistake to use the comic costumes in the movie because they just don't fit in to a real life scenario.  The costumes used in the movie still look comic book like, but appear more like ""customized uniforms"" if you will.  The movie leaves very little to be desired.  I recommend any fan of Action Movies, Comical Movies, or Sci-Fi Movies to purchase this DVD or VHS.  As for the quality of the DVD itself- its just as perfect as the movie.  In terms of picture, the colors and detail are depicted in perfect quality on this DVD.  The sound has to be the best I've heard on a DVD.

I mean it is a comic book for pete sake, not Gone with the Wind, it will be a little cheesey here and there.

Why is the boy who is sent into the Coma by Rogue not named Cody?  Seems like a simple matter to get the name right.  Also, Rogue gives away her real name in like 30 seconds, something she has never done.  Also, they don't play it up as if there is any prior relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth.  Granted they leave Logan's past pretty hazy, but it definitely seems like Sabretooth doesn't know him either.
The film is very well made and is worth watching even if you aren't a fan.  The action could be better, sometimes it is hard to follow, and peoples movements seem odd (especially when they are thrown around, they either fly too far or too slowly).
One last comment.  Hugh Jackman was a great choice for Wolverine, he pulled it off very well.  I would have liked to have seen Russell Crowe just because he is a great actor, but am glad he made Gladiator.  i thing Gougray Scott would have stunk as Wolverine.",974937600,,1129,4.415458937198068

Well, then came X-Men.  6 times I saw this movie in the theatre, and every time, it was like seeing it for the first time.  The movie does the impossible, it takes a 30 year old comic book property and makes it publically accessible, which is in its self, a triumph.  Yet, then there are all of those little things that fanboys, such as I would pick up on.  Especially the ""yellow spandex"" joke toward the ending of the movie.  The movie also took it's subject matter seriously, which most comic movies don't do.  The X-Men isn't about rich guys upset about dead parents, or aliens sent to Earth who grow up to be over the top boyscouts in blue tights, its about, simply put, racism.  Humanity hates and fears mutants because of their genetic enhancements.  Fueling humanities hatred, Sentator Kelly, bent on advancing his political career by stoking the proverbial fire.  There truly is no villain in this movie save humanities ignorance, but on the more extreme side of the mutant spectrum is Magneto.  Having survived the Holocaust in WW2, he fears world wide mutant genocide and is prepared to take any actions to prevent this from happening...even if it means waging a war on humanity.  On the other end of the spectrum, Professor Xavier, who respects humanity and only wishes peaceful coexistance with them.  Visually, this film is stunning.  The ""mutant effects"" look real, especially Cyclop's optic blast.  The only problems I had with this movie were that it wasn't long enough and that Storm didn't have a bigger role.  Halle Berry was a wonderful Storm and she commanded every scene she was in, but her role wasn't big enough.  Hopefully, that will be rectified when the sequel gets made.  Oh, and Patrick Stewart has affirmed himself as a great actor to the general populace.  I guess you all are finding out what we Star Trek fans already knew.  :)",974937600,,1971,4.6579710144927535

Something for everybody!! The special effects & are done well (without copying 'The Matrix'!!), and the movie didn't stray too far from the comic's essence. The 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound is excellent, so your stereo will get a work out!!

 I enjoyed seeing characters I knew (Storm, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Prof. X, Magneto, Cyclops, etc.), and the film laid the groundwork for future movie sequels by giving brief introductions to 'young mutants' like Bobby Blake (the future 'Iceman', and others with special gifts!!).SEQUEL?? You can bet on it!!!

 If you are familiar with the X-Men, you should be satisfied with this DVD, but the movie failed to introduce or speak of the other ORIGINAL X-Men (The Beast,and the Angel to be exact), but the script works well.

 **Now, as for the BONUS FEATURES, they aren't top notch at all. After being treated with 'TOP LEVEL' bonus features in the new Terminator 2 DVD & the Independance Day DVDs, the X-Men DVD serves up average stuff.
 ~The extra 10 minutes of scenes should not have been clipped to begin with. What's an extra 10 minutes going to matter ??
 ~The interview with Bryan Singer was annoying!! Not because of Bryan, but because it is chopped into 6 or 7 '2 minute' segments!! Why not show the entire interview in one segment ??
 ~The 'Mutant Watch' News Parody is great, and it's actors overdo it at times, but it's a fun segment. Other bonuses include photo stills, and that's fine too.
 In short, this DVD would make a nice addition to your collection!!...",974937600,4,1776,4.79344262295082
1265521,1,B00003CX8I,"Wish You Well by David Baldacci is one book I just couldn't put down.  A great story about one family's life on top of a mountain in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia in the early 1940's.  Its about honesty, integrity, hope and true love.  In particular, it is about a young girl and her brother who grow up and learn what life is really all about...about having decent values and not compromising the truth.  Great character development.  Interesting facts about rural life in the mountains.  Superb story.  I only wish I could have been there myself.",974937600,2,556,4.729166666666667
1265591,4,B00003CX8I,"I liked this movie. Was it the greatest super-hero movie ever? No. That title still goes to Superman 2 in my opinion. But this movie does show that modern technology can make comic book creations come to life on screen without looking overly garish. From Cyclops optic blasts to Wolverines claws, we get treated with some very nice special effects and pretty good dialogue among the characters. There could have been some definite improvements to the movie such as finding a more realistic lookking wig for Storm or getting an older actor to play Cyclops as Jean looked way too old for him.  As for the dvd, the picture is clean and crips. Definitely a pleasure to view. Extras are pretty sparse with the standard character art, language select, etc. The dvd says that there are ten minutes of extra footage. Let me clarify this. First off, you could play he extra footage by themselves or view them while watching the regular feature. However, the footage isn't exactly cleaned up so it looks out of place and blurry a bit. Also, some footage are the same exact scenes as in the regular feature with some extra dialogue that had been spliced out. So, when you view the footage with the feature you could be seeing the same scenes twice. Another thing..this disc may have problems playing in older dvd players. I couldn't get it to play on my first gen Phillips Magnavox player, but it did play well on my portable Panasonic dvd-l50 and my Playstation 2. So be forewarned if you have an older receiver.",974937600,6,1502,4.646616541353383
1265592,5,B00003CX8I,"Remember that stinker Spider-Man movie in the 70's?  Or how about that terrible early 90's Captain America?  Dolph Lungren as the Punisher!!??!! It seems that the only cool comic characters that became movies were Superman, Batman, Blade, MIB, and that cool Hulk TV show with Bill Bixby. But the long overdue  X-Men is about as good as you can get for a comic movie while staying fairly true to the original.
Although we see the origins of Magneto and Rogue, the story seems to center around Wolverine (who is no doubt the most popular of the X-Men).  We see how Wolvie survives as a drifter in Canada, unable to remember his past as a military experiment, how he and Rogue meet up with the X-Men and are taken to Xavier's school,where there are cameos by Jubilee,Iceman, and a kid with blue hair (Beast perhaps?), and the X-Men's struggle not only with Magneto and the public who fears them, but with themselves.  The tension between Wolvie and Cyclops is great too.
Hugh Jackman is AWESOME as the ol' Canuckle Head (it seems as though he IS Wolvie) and has some of the best lines in the movie.  Cyclops to Logan: ""How do we know it's really you?""  Logan: ""You're a d--k!!"" CLASSIC!!!  Patrick Stewart as Professor X is pretty convincing as well.
Comic purists will find fault with the movie, as did sub geeks with U571, war geeks with The Patriot, gun geeks with all the Lethal Weapon movies, and all cops with any Dirty Harry movie.  ""The uniforms were different!""  ""The air inlet on the Blackbird isn't correct!""  ""Where were the Sentinels?"" This movie is set up perfectly for a sequel, which will no doubt come soon.

1265593,2,B00003CX8I,"A totally mindless film adaptation of Stan Lee's X-Men Comic book series.  This film had me pndering for hours why a director would destroy a perfectly good comic series into an hour and a half of endless idiocy.  The acting was fairly good to start, and the beggining looked almost promising, but then, it dropped off considerably once you hit the first action scene.  This movie may be based on a comic book series, true, but to make a feature length film out of people flying in the air and smashing each other is pointless.  The director did do a good job with the casting I must say though, Ian Mcklellan, and Patrick Stewart save this film from hitting rock bottom.",974851200,,671,4.520661157024794
1265594,5,B00003CX8I,"I didn't get to see X-men while it was in the theaters, so when my husband and I bought the DVD, I was worried about a little something I like to call ""Overhype Syndrome"": you know, when everybody you know sees a movie before you do, and they all tell you how great it is, and by the time you see it, you're expecting great things, and when you don't get them, you're all let down and ready to hurt someone. Well, I've read every review, and visited the website, and all my friends have seen it, and I was definately expecting great things. And I got them. I got them all. Every expectation was met. Not too much bad dialog to clog up the flow of the story, no drawn out mush scenes dragging down the pace. It was great. Cyclops was the perfect uptight geek, Jean Grey was appropriately Goody-Goody, and the best part, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos didn't mess up her part by trying to act. Sure, there were things that didn't follow the comic book (Wolverine was a little tall, and Rogue had a real name, and Storm wasn't claustrophobic), but none of it really mattered. The only really major change was Magneto's origin, but that was to make his reasoning look like more than just pure evil. Anyway, the movie was AWESOME! If you haven't seen it yet, see it.

1265595,4,B00003CX8I,"When I first heard that Stan Lee wanted to make an X-Men movie, I shuddered with fear about what the childish cartoonish outcome would be.  However, whilst viewing Shaft in the theater, I saw the theatrical trailer for the X-Men film. My jaw actually, physically dropped open!!!! I am not kidding, I was like the great Homer Simpson in a doughnut shop!!!!! My anticipation raced through the veins of my body, so that throughout Shaft all I could think of was Rogue.....ohhhhhh sweet Rogue......Anyhoo, I ended up seeing Shaft a second time because I could not concentrate on the film!  When I first saw the film I could not believe my eyes! What a great portrayal of Lee's misunderstood mutants.  Hugh Jackman was so inot the character Wolverine, that I was disappointed he didn't keep the cool haircut!  And Famke Jansen? Oh yeah, Jean Grey is hot. I loved the rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops too, it added some much needed humor to an otherwise dark movie. As a prospective educator, I would not recommend this one for the kids, its dark and violent.  But for us adults that grew up with the comic book, as I did, it is so well worth your seeing!!!  Kudos to Bryan Singer, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, for another great movie!!!  An all around fun and action packed movie, highly recommended!!!  Oh, and Mr. Lee?  Can't wait to see Spiderman and how about working on a Fantastic Four film?!!!!",974851200,,1392,4.672131147540983
1265596,5,B00003CX8I,"I must admit...I made a mistake. I am a longtime comic book reader and X-men was one of my all time favorites. I collect the comic books, I bought the cartoon video tapes. I even worked one semester as an intern at Marvel comics and met Mr. Stan Lee himself! (An incredibly amiable and energetic fellow!) When X-men came out at the theaters, as much as I was dying to see it...I didn't go. I was afraid they would destroy this great universe that I had known since I was thirteen. Boy was I wrong! I rented it last night and was kicking myself for not seeing it on the big screen! I was happy from the first scene where they show Magneto's parents being taken to a Nazi prison camp. And throughout the whole movie the focus seemed more on the characters, their motivations, and storyline, rather than bang-um-up special effects. I hate when movies use action and special effects as a crutch for their lame movie lines. The X-men comic is rich in characters and has a lot to do with feeling ostrisized, hated and learning to accept that which is different. I am so glad the writers took this into account!! The performances were also on par with the film, with the best work coming out of Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin. At first, I didn't like the fact that they were starting Rogue out as a teenager, but it did work well to show how she came to understand and fear her power. And even though the love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey was indicated in the movie, I was much more impressed by the relationship with Wolverine and Rogue. He has a compassionate, very big brother sort of connection with her and it seems to have more spark than he and Jean. Also, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were perfect as the two patrons of the mutant factions! Way to go X-men movie makers! Two enthusiastic thumbs up and hopes for more in the future.(If as much care is taken to make them right!) I also commend you for having Stan Lee's and Jack Kirby's input on the movie...I'm sure they had a hand in making this what it was! OH--ONE LAST THING!!If you rent the movie make sure to check out the additional 10 minutes of out takes after the credits! I wish these had remained in the movie- it goes even further into the character relationships and features a couple of other well known x-men (the names ShadowCat and Jubilee sound familiar??)",974851200,,2349,4.452436194895592

While I was a bit disappointed by the plot of the movie, the effects and characters were fantastic.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the development of each character, but I understand there was so much territory to cover that they could only do so if they had a sequel.....hmmmmm.  Overall, I think the cast does a good job of getting into character, and I thoroughly enjoyed Rogue's character (no comment about male chauvenism...)  A good flick and one that a DVD copy should be in everyone's library!!!",974851200,,632,4.517543859649122

1265599,4,B00003CX8I,"""X-Men"", starring Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Ian McKellen as Magneto is the best film adapted from a comic book in recent years.  In ""X-Men"" the world is experiencing a strange mutant phenomenon.  These mutants are so feared that a conservative senator (Bruce Davison) is trying to pass a bill for mutant registration.  The theme of the movie (and comic book) is that mutants are just like regular people, in fact most of them don't even want their strange abilities.  That leads to the film's central conflict; there are two groups of mutants, one good and one evil.  The good mutants are of course the ""X-Men"" led by Professor X and the evil mutants are led by Magneto.  Magneto and his ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" have been so mistreated by society that they have taken upon themselves to ""mutate"" the human race.
One of the areas where this film succeeds is creating a world realistic enough for these mutants to be believable, it takes the same approach that the first ""Superman"" film did.  Instead of populating his world with fantastic sets and costumes, director Bryan Singer emphasizes on the fantastic characters and makes them people.  The X-Men behave just like people in the real world.  They work well together, then some like the Wolverine and Cyclops dislike eachother very much, in fact they both compete for the affections of the lovely Jean Grey.  The humanity of the comic characters doesn't stop with the X-Men.  In fact the villian of the movie, Magneto, had such a horrific childhood that you could almost understand his distrust for non-mutants. It's through these touches that ""X-Men"" reveals itself to be far deeper than the usual summer blockbuster.
Most of the story concerns the initiation of the wayward mutants Wolverine and Rogue into the X-Men and their struggle to adapt to mutant society.  The X-Men soon battle Magneto and his Brotherhood hoping to stop him from destroying the human race.
Although more serious than other comic-book films, ""X-Men"" still manages to be quite fun and entertaining. It is full of great suprises, action, visual effects, a good chuckle here and there, and of course black jump suits.  This is a super hero movie after all.  If there is anything strange about the film it's in the way film abrupty ends.  It seems that the filmmakers realized that there could be no satisfying way to ""end"" a super hero movie with this subject matter.  The ""end"" may take a couple of sequels, in fact the movie ends in such a way that you almost expect ""To Be Continued"" to come across the screen.  If the next X-Men films are as good as this, I hope it continue.",974764800,,2616,4.764966740576496
1265710,4,B00003CX8I,"I had waited for this movie since Superman was adapted to the big screen, and I'm glad that it took this long. The reason? Because the special effects technology allowed the movie enough spectacular effects to wow the eye, and because Patrick Stewart was now THE perfect casting as Professor X. All in all the balance of character development, perfect casting of all the characters, and an actioned packed storyline make this a thouroughly enjoyable experience. Hopefully this will open the door to other titles from the Marvel franchise equally promising as big screen abdaptations. The Avengers come to mind. A must see if you're a comic book fan. Parents might want to review it before allowing younger children to view it as some of them might find some of the violence and language inappropriate for pre-teens.",974764800,,815,4.956204379562044
1265711,4,B00003CX8I,"Comic books are notoriously difficult to translate to feature-film format.  Goodness knows, there have been missteps in the past.  But director Brian Singer does about as good a job as can be reasonably expected. First off, we need to thank the makers of Mission Impossible 2 for running over-schedule, thus tying up actor Dougray Scott and consequently allowing actor Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine.  Jackman is the standout in this movie.  His wonderfully understated performance as the ""reluctant hero"" is arguably the centerpiece of this film.
What distinguishes this film from other lesser film adaptions is an intelligent script, or at least intelligent for the genre.  Character development isn't sacrificed to make room for more standard mindless special effects and action setpieces, like in some movies (""Batman and Robin"", anyone?).
The in-jokes are funny, and the characters' history and motivations are treated with a fan's level of respect.
If the filmmakers can retain those elements of character-driven story and a respect for the source material in future installments, then they may have a successful movie franchise on their hands.

Update January 01, 2015:  My review from 2000 ---  I meant it at the time.  Just watched it again today for the first time in about 14 years.  I have to say that it didn't hold up as well as I'd hoped.  It really comes off too serious and self-important now.  In the years since the release of ""X-Men"" we've been treated to several of its sequels, a spinoff, 3 really decent Spider-Man films (and 2 that were terrible), 3 ""Iron Man"" films, two ""Captain America"" films, 2 good ""Batman"" films"" (plus one really horrible one) and one ""Avengers"" film.  The first ""X-Men"" now seems dated and tired by comparison.  And a little boring, too.",974592000,67,1786,5.030612244897959
1265712,5,B00003CX8I,"I want to say that I don't think they could have picked anyone better to be Wolverine in the X-Men movie. If you look at Hugh decked out as Wolverine, he actually is Wolverine personified, as was Chris Reeves when he portrayed Superman in the Superman movies. I think that with Hugh bringing Wolverine to life in the X-Men movie, it's going to have a great impact on the way he (Wolverine) is portrayed in the comic books, because now we have all got a grasp on the actual physically human side of wolverine that a drawing cannot give. The portraial of all of the X-men was everything that I hoped it would be.  I was a bit skeptical about there being mad a live-action X-Men movie, because of the amount of difficulty that their powers and basically the marvel universe would be to make into a live-action movie, but it met my approval very much.",974505600,3,847,4.42948717948718
1265713,4,B00003CX8I,"This is a great movie that really chronicles the beginnings of Rogue, Wolverine and Magneto more than any of the other characters.  It stays relatively true to the X-Men of the comics with some license taken here and there.  I'm only disappointed with the amount of language and inappropriate things in it.  For this reason, I only gave it four stars.  I don't think it would be appropriate for younger kids to see it.  There is also a lot of violence that is a little extreme for younger viewers.  I would highly recommend this movie, however, to the adult and older teen age groups.  The visual effects were spectacular and Patrick Stewert is the perfect Prof. X.  It is set up perfectly for a sequel.  Watch it and enjoy it.",974419200,14,727,4.530769230769231

After seeing such fare as Superman IV, Captain America, or Batman & Robin (shudder), I was probably not alone in this feeling.  After seeing the movie, my opinion changed greatly.  Nine times out of ten, a movie adapted from a comic book will be almost painful to watch.  This flick, however, will eventually enter the Halls of Great Comic Adaptions, alongside The first Superman (1979) and Batman (1989) movies.
If you do not watch this movie, you are only depriving yourself of a great movie experience.",974332800,,575,4.72
1265715,5,B00003CX8I,"The best inside joke of the entire movie right there. It's genius. I saw this three times during the flight from Miami to Vienna (possible with Lauda Air, my new fave airline), once without sound, and I still loved it. What can I say? Genius.
The action really begins in some remote area of northern Alberta, where we meet the two real focuses of the movie- the teenage Rogue (a mutant with the uncontrollable ability to drain the energy of others) and the brooding Wolverine, whose skeleton is made up of a near-indestructable metal called adamantine (or some such word). Then the bad guys show up and the party starts. Heartstopping action all the way through.
The only beef I have about this film (besides the length, which was short- *sequel, sequel, sequel*) is the fried toad line (others who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about). It was supposed to be menacing, but really it added a cheese factor to the entire movie which I'd ignored until then.

X-Men manages to welcome people who have never read the comic wholeheartedly into the marvel universe, while staying true to the die-hard fans.  in short, the story is great, the visuals and music are astounding, and it was meant to be seen in DVD. oh, and by the way, the DVD contains never before seen footage from the movie, one containing Spider Man.  if you haven't seen this yet in the theaters, you don't know what you are missing.  and if you have, then you must know how much of a must-have item this is.",974160000,,701,4.410852713178294

This is a really good super hero movie, featuring a director that actually knows his stuff.  Hugh Jackman does a great job as wolverine, and you'll probably not even notice his accent (yeah, he does have one!). Fans of Episode 1 will also notice that Ray Park plays Toad, and although he doesn't do a lot of the moves he did in EP1 it's still awesome to watch him do what little he does. Great one-liners,  nice actor/actress chemistry, and a storyline that manages to avoid being corny make this a great DVD to buy.",974073600,,694,4.40625

""X-Men"" depicts the struggle of a small group of mutants, who must defend a world that hates and fears them.  The main story focuses on two of the mutants in particular - Rogue and Wolverine.  Brilliant performances by a very talented cast, including U.S. movie rookie Hugh Jackman, make X-men one of the best film adaptations since the original ""Batman"".

Honestly, I believe a lot of people will be wanting a sequel for this one, especially after having seen the audience reaction to it in England (where I happened to watch it for the first time).  As an English major, I found the storyline entriguingly original and well thought out.

They should have casted Wayne Newton (he has more acting chops).  As for the rest of the cast, I thought their acting left alot to be desired.  Personally, besides Newton as Prof. X, I would have had as Wolferine, Steven Segal; Storm, Sally Field; Cyclops, Robert Downey Jr.; Jean Grey, Rupaul; and Magnito, Nipsey Russel.

Still, the storyline was easy to follow, and I could tell that a lot of characters had to be cut so that the few which remained had enough depth to give the movie some dimension.  Bryan Singer is an absolutely awesome director; he is at his best again with an ensemble cast ( much like his '95 thriller ""The Usual Suspects"").  My personal favorite is Wolverine and Magneto: Hugh Jackman can't be replaced, and Ian Mckellen shines also.
What makes ""X-Men"" so interesting and different from regular good guy-bad guy action movies the most, though, is that there isn't that obvious distinctness which seperate them.  Magneto and his pack seem like they're all evil and the X-men all good, but they are not without its flaws.  They aren't Supermen; they are human.  But those are the traits which make them seem like true heroes-at least in my viewpoint.

1265783,4,B00003CX8I,"Just when I thought comic adaption was a dead genre, X-MEN by Bryan Singer of the Usual Suspects fame has scripted a movie packed full of stupendous CG graphics and more importantly an enchanting allegory to life.
The clash between Magneto and Professor X and the human intensity in the action-packed drama captivates, because of a tight script and a well-ensembled cast boasting credible acts from Anna Paquin as Rogue and the enigmatic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It dissects a human drama between the difference of a mutant and ordinary, of race and segregation, and it makes the audience feel for the idiosynacractic ways that the mutants handle their grief of being ostracized. Professor X is suitably diginified; Ian McKellen as Magneto is embittered.
The fluid CG graphics add a sparkle to the action scenes where you see Wolverine and Storm wielding their power against Toad and Mystique and Bryan Singer has impressively incorporate so many characters in one show and yet able to make each and every hero alive. The only thing you blame is - there isn't deep characterization for every one of them, but that's understandable.
It's such fun and nostalgia to see your heroes and heroines battle out,criticizing the accuracy of the portrayal. But in the end - you realize the impact of X-MEN's popularity is the grandeur of the solid human dissection between good and evil.",973814400,,1378,4.96969696969697

If you think this is going to be a glowing review, you're DARN STRAIGHT!My expectations where off the charts for this movie.  I hate when I do that 'cause I usually get let down.  NOT IN THIS CASE!  IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.  Everything was great about this movie.  The characters, the effects, and especially the story line.  It stayed true to everything I know about the X-Men, which isn't as much as some, and Wolverine, which I know quite a bit about.  What can I say I'm a bit of a Fan-Boy.  Heck I have a tatoo of Spider-Man on my arm.  By the way, if they screw up that movie, I'm gonna be pissed! The story revolves around Logan, or Wolverine, as he likes to be called, when he first comes in contact with the other mutants, or X-Men at Prof. Xaviers school for gifted youngsters.  He's a rebel. A cigar smokin', beer drinkin' , out of control SOB.But he is as cool as hell.  He has a metal skeleton, and metal claws that prorude from his knuckles when he gets pissed, and has to hurt someone. He is a wild man but, he has a soft side.  I don't want to get into it too much cause I don't want to give any of the movie away, so that's all I'm going to say about the plot.

This guy was pretty much an unkownbut he played this part perfectly.  Just enough insanity along with heart.  He was Wolverine. Doug Ray Scott was supposed to do this part, but he had to do another little summer movie, which by the way is going to be crushed by X-Men, called Mission Impossible 2.  Which I won't see until it comes out on video, because car chases just don't thrill me that much.  He is going to be kicking himself for doing that instead of X-Men. It's only Sunday, and the totals are already up to 57million.  So they probably haven't even confirmed what it made today. The reason it's doing so well is not because of the F/X, it's because they actually, finally did a comic book movie right. They made the characters so you cared about what happened to them, and it wasn't just a bunch of senseless F/X.The two sides were actually fighting for something they believed in.  I WANT TO BE WOLVERINE!I'm going nuts I have to end this review. THE GOODI can't say enough good about this.  It's a great film you can take your whole family to see, and everyone from kids to adults will love it. THE BADYeah right! THE BOTTOM LINEIf you only see one film this summer, seriously, make this the one you see.  And see it more than once.  You'll enjoy the second time even more.  One other thing, go to a theater with good sound and picture quality. Overall I give this my highest rating A+.I liked it better than Green Mile, and Fight Club.",973641600,22,3312,4.788732394366197

1265786,5,B00003CX8I,"I am a geek, however I do not bite the heads off chickens at local fairs.  The term has come to encompass quite a few meanings over the years.  In high schools it is used to describe academically inclined individuals with a slight build or those that fall outside of the ""in crowd"".  In my time I have come to embrace these people as my own.  We are generally more interesting than the musclebound idiots that made our lives hell for those formative four years.  I don't hold grudges though.  I have actually come to appreciate the lessons I learned as a young geek.  I learned how to think myself out of uncomfortable and sometimes even dangerous situations.  I learned to use those things that seperated me from the mainstream to my advantage.  These qualities became the definition of my being all those years ago and have developed into the talents I have come to love and appreciate above all of my other attributes.  I also enjoy films with lots of action, humor and things getting blown up.  If this sounds at all like you; you too will love the X-Men.
This film deals with the core characters that even those who have just seen the Fox saturday morning cartoon will recognize. Storm, Rogue, Cyclops, Professor X, Jean Grey and of course... Wolverine.  Hardcore fans will undoubtedly miss their own favorite mutants, but I feel that Bryan Singer selected the best characters for the story and uses them, and their powers, beautifully.
Singer also realizes that the measure of heroes are the villains that they have to deal with.  Magneto and his league of evil mutants are sketched broadly, but with enough attention to the details to make them come alive and even seem sympathetic.  Fans of the comics will pick up on some very subtle nuances that Singer placed there for us while those new to the Mutantverse will enjoy the action and (very) cool effects.
The performances are dead on with Hugh Jackman standing out above and beyond everyone's expectations.  The long and short of it is that he just became Wolverine.  There were stories relayed from the set that he got so into his character that at one point he had actually sustained an injury while suspended in a harness and wasn't helped down for quite a while because no one knew he was actually hurt.  I am really looking forward to seeing him in other roles in the future.
The script was a little loose with some cheesey dialogue at times; but this is a comic book movie.  Some of that has to be expected.  Being the first film in the series the requisite broad strokes are there to set up the remaining flicks in the series.  I have to say that this was a far better set up than Phantom Menace.  If only Halle Berry had never asked ""Do you know what happens to a toad that gets hit by lightning?""  The movie would have been perfect.
The suplements listed seem interesting and will include a ""documentary"" that was shown on Fox detailing Senator Kelley's political views on how to deal with the ""mutant menace"" as well as other nice little goodies.  (I am a geek you know.  I like my tech goodies)
At least give X-Men a rent.  I guarantee you'll be back and adding it to your cart soon.",973555200,2,3154,4.530035335689046
1265787,4,B00003CX8I,"This is a fine rendition of the Marvel Comic of the same name. Although Hollywood has often turned to comics lately, they're rarely done one this well. Once you've accepted the basic premise that humanity has suddenly and spontaneously mutated to the extent that any of a host of ""superpowers"" are rampant in the population, then you are off for a romp. If you can't buy this, then stay away! The casting is superb--apparently Hugh Jackman was a late substitution, but he is so good it is hard to imagine anyone else in the part. Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen as Magneto are also perfect for their roles, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos will be in the dreams of every teenaged boy who sees this film for years to come. I have to admit that I found the character and portrayal of Toad by Ray Park so totally over-the-top (yes, he has a long sticky tongue and hops around...sheesh!!) that it was absurd--it really detracted from the overall effect. But for the most part, Marvel Comic characters and stories have always had more depth than their DC counterparts, and the movie takes full advantage of this. Even the bad guys are motivated not primarily from a desire to do evil, but from self-preservation. Special effects in this film were fantastic, the plot was reasonably complex and interesting, characters had some depth--the criticism that there were simply too many characters is valid, but after all the film wasn't X- *MAN*....and of course, we are set up for a sequel. If they keep this quality, I'd be happy to see it--I thought this was the best comic treatment I've seen since the original Batman with Michael Keaton. It ain't Shakespeare, but hey, even Shakespeare had odd people with strange powers in his plays (Midsummer Night's Dream, for one example)....",973555200,,1797,4.818770226537217

Bryan Singer wasn't my first choice for directing this movie (I probably would have gone with richard donner), but after seeing it I am glad he was put in charge. This movie is the best since the original superman. You won't find as much action (or comedy) in any of the other comic based movies. I give credit to the big M, Marvel comics and stan lee, for giving us a great film. The acting is very good, not cheesy at all. Hugh Jackman is the new hero of the day, as he is the one and only WOLVERINE. I give credit to everyone involved in this movie.

The movie is different than the comic book in some ways as I learned from the others. So, the lovers of X-men can be a little depressed. But some minutes later they will forget it and get in the REAL ACTION!  As a movie X-men, with special effect, charismatic characters (Wolverine, even I want to be like Wolverine at the moment, Cyclops, Storm, Doctor, and Xavier), and unique concept, is a real action film. You don't know what director Spike would make in the next scene. He makes Wolverine nearly kill 17-year-old girl, or numerous games with Mystique, or high-speed action. This is a must seen movie and also should be bought as a DVD. Good work to al of the crew of X-MEN.

First, it is well written, leaving just enough cheese and in-jokes for fans of the comics--but it doesn't ignore the newbie, either.  Each important plot point is explained, and we are saved from watching the ""origin"" of every character.
Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Professor X, and Ian McKellan as Magneto really steal the show.  They've embodied their characters, and work well together.  The message of discrimination is never played heavy-handed, but it comes across.  All in all, a solid performance.
Michael Kamen's music is wonderful and fitting.  Just the right amount of adrenaline and somberness.  (I recommend you by the CD as well as the DVD!)
In short, X-Men is a rewarding superhero flick.  People with children however, should be warned that there is an amount of violence, but it is not gory.  All in all, and excellent movie.",973123200,73,976,4.9753086419753085

This is not Orson Welles, it's not even Orson Scott Card, but it is fun nevertheless.  Patrick Stewart is a dead-on Xavier, and Hugh Jackman is almost as perfectly cast as Wolverine.  The costumes have been updated (and watch for jokes referencing the costumes from the comic series), and a few major characters from the cartoon show do not appear, such as the Beast and Jubilee, but overall this is a fun movie experience that will not disappoint but will not change your life, either.",973036800,,606,4.69811320754717

I admit that this movie was more of an introductory movie.  That excites me too... I can't wait to see the coming films.  I'm thrilled by this movie because it focused on some of those characters who did not get as much attention, like Rogue (played by the wonderful Anna Paquin) and Wolverine (played by the relatively new face Hugh Jackman).  The overplayed Cyclops, Jean Gray and Professor X are mostly in the background, and might get more play in the next movie.  My only problem right now is where my other favorite, yet under appreciated, characters are and when they will appear.  Hey, Gambit and Jubilee... I'm waitin' on you.

1265934,4,B00003CX8I,"I received a preliminary copy of the X-Men: The Movie DVD and I have to say it's very nicely put together. The menus are a lot like the official website for the movie if you had the chance to check that out last Spring when all the hype was in full swing.
As for the movie itself, it's very good, perhaps the best super-hero movie ever made. Director Bryan Singer does a good job of establishing each of the main characters. While not everyone gets the amount of screen time Wolverine does, you get a pretty good sense who these characters are and what they're about.
The story is essentially drawn from the X-Men comic book, featuring the team's battle against the violent mutant forces of Magneto, the mutant master of magnetism. Pitted against the X-Men's telepathic mentor, Dr. Charles Xavier, Magneto poses as Malcolm X to Xavier's Martin Luther King. While Xavier wants to establish a peaceful coexistence for mutants among humans, Magneto does not believe humanity will ever accept mutants and therefore adopts a more violent approach.
The script could have used a little more tweaking here and there. The dialogue's clunky at times and the one liners aren't very original. The cinematography gives you a pretty good sense of a comic book come to life without going overboard like the Batman films or Dick Tracy. Nothing against those movies, but X-Men takes a more realistic approach to telling a super-hero story.
The DVD also includes the trailers and a nice interview with Singer. All in all, a great package!",972950400,9,1520,4.805343511450381
1265935,5,B00003CX8I,I am not rating this as a DVD but as the movie I saw in the theatre plus all the trailers and backround information I saw since then. I though the character of Magneto had the most depth and was the most interesting.  I went into the movie very skeptical as I had read one of the comic books a while ago and thought there would be too much glitz. Well there was alot of tasteful and very well done effects and the interplay between Wolverine and Cyclops towards Jean Gray had me smiling the whole way through. It was nice to see two guys as rivals yet not trying to kill each other. I also thought the Senator played by Bruce Davidson was very good too.,972950400,,653,4.141732283464567
1265936,3,B00003CX8I,"Well, what can I possibly add to the hundred of reviews of this long-awaited over-hyped cult comics adaptation? My sober and unbiased opinion, for it's the first time ever I've seen and heard the phenomenon called ""X-men"" (well, beside the toons they show on Cartoon Network).
It's not what I'd call a WOW!-movie (as it always happens with movies where about half-dozen of good actors have just several lines to tell and nothing else to stand out), but far from an UGH!-movie (like much-despised 3 helpings of Batman). Good cast, plausible and persuasive intrigue, some visually splendid as well as emotionally touching scenes, minimum gore and lethal results.
ALL in ALL the movie had a relaxing effect on me. The fans will buy it, the rest of you - watch it at least once. I don't doubt there will be at least 3 series upcoming, I hope they will not spoil the first impression...",972950400,6,881,4.7272727272727275

I will say though that this movie was an entertaining experience for all. The message of human tolerance tied into a fantasy/sci-fi genre story is great. The idea that everyone should have inalienable human rights is something that can never be said enough times, even in this new century.

1266057,5,B00003CX8I,"As a long time fan of comics, I always look forward to the films with some trepidation. Like any written story that has acquired a huge fan base, a worthy transfer to the screen is difficult to say the least, more so when the players of the story are given visual characterization as in the comic's medium.  If the face doesn't match the comic version the actor has to try doubly hard to win over the fan. In the case of the X-Men, casting has hit the target bull's eye, leaving the actors the luxury of being able to slip into the roles like an old coat. Transition from the page is smooth as silk so the comic fan can take in the film as they would any issue of the mag.  But what of the non-fan? Is the film worth seeing? YOU BET, if you like fast-paced action, special effects, and a 'good vs. bad guys' storyline, with a deeper underlying character play that is almost submerged by the action, X-Men will not disappoint.

1266059,4,B00003CX8I,"First, I must say that it's kind of funny how many ""reviews of the DVD"" there are before it even came out. Still, like everyone else, I want to have my say about the movie, even before seeing the DVD.
I'm not a fan of the comics, in the sense of knowing them well and buying them. I might have bought a couple, and watched a few episodes of the animated series. What I saw I liked, but it was some time ago, and when I came to see this movie, I was missing a lot of stuff, even basic stuff, like what Rogue's power is. But I knew enough to know who most of the characters were.
The movie, IMO, was meant mainly as an exposition to next ones. It looked like this, although this feeling wasn't as strong as I got when I saw Spawn. There was still enough of a story and conclusion here.
I liked it that it's not a special effect movie. Yes, there are great special effects, but they are so well integrated, that they just look natural. The only time I felt an effect was a little forced was when Jean Gray shows her telekinesis power when she's working on wolverine. But generally the effects were so well done, that they did their job of fleshing an impossible world without drawing attention to themselves, and there was enough story to keep you engaged and not thinking of them (unlike, for example, Star Wars Episode 1).
What I really liked about this movie is that it's deep and interesting enough. It goes way beyond just action, or even character interaction (which is also done pretty well). The initial scene, with Magneto's parents being taken to be cremated by the Nazis was pretty strong, IMO (a friend I saw the movie with thought it was a bit too much to put a reference to the holocaust in a blockbuster movie, but I disagree). It puts in an interesting light the attempts to have mutations ""licensed"", and allows some understanding of Magneto.
The idea of the character of Rogue is great. A girl who can't touch anyone - that's true agony. And then there's Wolverine with his lost memories. This really has the making of a great story, which is why, as the title says, it makes me interested in reading more about these characters.
The film also does well in capturing the sexy spirit of many current comics. Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are certainly very attractive women, as is Rebecca Romjin-Stamos. I guess that the men are not bad looking, either, but I'm not the best judge of that. I did feel that both Magneto and Storm were a little, well, smaller than I imagined them from my previous encounters with the X-Men series. But that wasn't a real problem for me.
That about sums it up. The main reason I don't give this movie 5 stars is because it was an introductory movie. If the second movie manages to keep to the standards set by this one, then it should be great.",972518400,14,2789,4.375722543352601

Now myself being a huge X-Men fan, absolutely loved this movie.  But this is a movie for people that know nothing about the series also.  With a very descriptive storyline, and character interaction relatioships, X-men hit the nail on the head with orinal movie, with many sequels to come.
Director Bryan Singer did an excellent job of not revealing too much of the story in two hours, but revealing just enough to keep audiences coming back for more.

X-men is a stylish artistic ride through the world of X-men.  Plus it has something some writers can learn from: a story.  The characters in the story are the most important, and each character has a personality of his or her own.  Although I would of liked to see a little more of Storm's character.  Plus the movie was cast almost perfectly.  Patrick Stewart and nobody else could have played Professor X, it was perfect.  Plus the production design, costumes, and special effects are true to X-men, and make it even better.

When I had heard about the release of X-Men the movie I was very skeptical.  This had all of the potential of being a big-costume, big-budget bust.  Tim Burton's brilliance aside, I could not realistically see a good movie coming from a comic book.
Needless to say, Brian Singer proved me wrong.  Hugh Jackman gave the best performance in the movie by far.  The tragic characters of Magneto and Rogue were brought to life in a much different light then the comics have painted.  The special affects were absoluteley awesome.  I saw this movie and realized that I was not watching a comic book on-screen, but a story unfold.  OK, I can admit a bit of the dialouge was a little forced, but overall this movie has far exceeded my expectations.
No you do not have to be a comic book fan to enjoy this movie.  X-Men tells a story of tragedy and triumph, with no defined  good or evil.  Cheers to Singer and to the whole cast and crew for annhilating the skeptics.",971827200,2,1116,4.342995169082125

1266174,4,B00003CX8I,"Wow! Now this is one heck of a sci-fi\action flick! Brian Singer sure proved to be a man of many skills. X-men is by far one of the best comic book-to movie-adaptations with only the original Batman and Batman Returns being on the same level. Why?First of all it actually has a script(no Batman & Robin bull),secondly it's a believable plot. Then we have the characters:all of them are suberb! Singer obviously did his homework cause these characters mirror the comic book heroes in an amazing way,both with the use of their powers and their way of thinking and actions. Then we have the action scenes which are breathtaking and put movies like M:I2 into shame(it's up there with the Matrix,honest) and special effects the likes of which we haven't seen in a while(again since Matrix).Plus the way Singer ""ends"" the movie is really smart 'cause he doesn't really close any chapters ,just saying ""i'll be back with a sequel"".The way it finishes kind of reminds me of the original Star Wars ,as if it's part of a series:In fact,the movie itself is just like a comic book issue..there is always next month! The only critisism i have for X-men is that it is very short. It couldv'e been a lot longer and there for better. That is the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.

1266175,5,B00003CX8I,"This is by far the best super-hero/comic book movie ever made. It has a good story, and the actors really do an excellent job of bringing the X-Men to live action. Unlike those crappy Batman movies, X-Men is meant to be taken seriously. There are some funny scenes, but the movie is not full of cheesy bland one-liners that the DC Comic movies are full of. Hugh Jackman does a superb job as Wolverine. Wolvie is basically the main character of the movie, and every scene that he is in is better than the last. There are several elaborate fight sequences between Sabretooth and Wolverine that are fun to watch. This is really a movie that is fun for almost the entire family. I am very happy that it is coming to video so quickly after it has left the theaters. If you are anyone you know is a comic book or action movie fan, get this movie for them.",971568000,25,849,4.3125

1266177,4,B00003CX8I,"X-Men is one of the top three best comic book adapted movies every made (Superman 1 & Batman 1 being the other two). The movie is made in a way in which people who have never picked up the comic book before can relate. No bright color spandex. No over the top explanation of why they have the powers they do. You walk out thinking, ""Yeah, I believe that's possible. Every actor plays his or her role to the ""T"". This is the perfect jump of movie for Hugh Jackman, who gives an excellent rendition of his comic book counter part Wolverine. Although Halle Berry performance as Storm was not as great as some would have hoped, (honestly due to a lack of lines and badly written at that) she does have the upcoming squeal to improve. I was glad to see that the director, Bryan Singer, did not overflow his cast of characters as some other comic book movies have done in the past. Although this movie could have been called Wolverine and the X-Men, most of the other characters are well represented. This movie proves that as long as you keep the essence of the character in tact, you still can have a successful movie that everyone will enjoy. I can't wait for the sequel. Sentinels anyone?",971395200,,1186,4.420091324200913
1266178,4,B00003CX8I,"During the last few years we've put up with some bad comic book adaptations that totally let the fans down. Movies like Batman & Robin, Steel ,and two of the last Superman flicks are some examples. Then came along the long awaited X-men movie which really changed the face of comic book films. In my eyes, this is the second most anticipated film made recently (first was Phantom Menace) and it was one of the best films this summer. The biggest star of the film should be the director, Bryan Singer, for making an actual movie version of a comic strip story that display its characters in detail.
But sadly the movie had some flaws that a number of hardcore fans of X-men would disapprove of. The most obvious for me is that Hallie Berry (Storm) had little to do with the plot, so it was hard to determine if Hallie was right for the role in the first place.
The film should have been called Wolverine 'cause he was the center of the story(not the ensemble, while Cyclops and co. takes the back seat. The Wolverine/ Sabretooth fight was good, but meant nothing cause their history from the comic didn't surface. The other fight scenes belittled the X-men, making them appear unable to throw a single punch. Plus, there are sections of the dialogue that were a bit dull.
Despite the screenplay mistakes the film is reasonably good. The sets are cleverly designed, the Magneto/ Professor X  rivalry was done brilliantly by Patrick Stewart and  Ian McKellen, the brief funny moments were fine like when Wolverine gave Cyclops the ""claw"".
Also Ray Park does another good turn as a super villain since his vile debut as Darth Maul in Episode 1, now he's the elusive Toad who really stole some scenes. The chick who played Rouge had a certain mysterious persona but a bit too sweet for the strong willed character, she did o.k. The special FX complemented the film without being a distraction or overkill. Hugh Jackman has potential to be one of  the new action heroes of the 21st century. He played Wolverine like Michael Keaton played Batman. The rest of the cast could have done better but like I said, the writer made a few mistakes.
Bottom line, the movie is plain cool. It adapted the heart of the comic and has a subtle status like Matrix. This is the type of direction that the genre needs. Let's hope that the makers of the new Superman movie actually reads a couple comic books like Bryan read his. Forget it!  Bryan should direct the new Superman, and Batman 5. X-men doesn't break any new ground, but a good film nevertheless.",971308800,,2533,4.584988962472406
1266179,5,B00003CX8I,"I was very excited to see this movie because I have been a long time fan of X-men.  It lived up to my expectations and more. The acting is great, the special effects are awesome and the overall movie is the best.  Everyone needs to own this movie. Very well done.",971308800,,263,4.137254901960785
1266180,4,B00003CX8I,"As soon as our group got out of the theatre we all unanimously rated the movie as a four out of a possible five.  As a science fiction/action adventure film I would give this a five.  But as an X-Men fan, I felt a little disappointed that I did not see more characters.  Also, the knowledge that I was going to have to wait a few more years before I would get the chance to see more of those characters rained on my parade a little.
At the same time, I also immediately decided to add this movie to my collection after seeing it because it IS a good movie.  For those who were introduced to the X-Men for the first time, this movie may have seemed sufficiently entertaining and complete in itself.  But as for me, although I loved watching it, I just couldn't help myself from longing to see a more complete (and varied) team of X-Men and a greater sense of finality to the ending.  Don't get me wrong - I loved the movie.  But something inside me wanted just a little bit more.",971222400,2,978,4.197860962566845

1266271,5,B00003CX8I,"I think that Bryan Singer's adaptation of the Marvel Comics title is the best, most true to form comic book film. While Tim Burton's Batman Returns is the best film of the comic book adaptations, X-Men feels the most like a true representation of the paper format. Rather than campy fun (a la Superman) or even complete misfire (Punisher, Captain America etc.), X-Men nails the comic book world with its representation of what the world might be like if it really had superheroes in it.
The best example of this is Alex Ross's Kingdome Come series, but that will never make it to the big screen. If you want a taste of comic book fun, as well as bare bones action and serious storytelling, check out X-Men.",971222400,,706,4.566929133858268
1266272,4,B00003CX8I,"After enduring years of countless rumors, the motion picture event that comic book junkies alike have waited for has arrived. While there were many heroes that were missing and others who appeared to be too young to be major contributors to the story, the movie itself does a good job recreating everyone's favorite merry mutants to the silver screen. While I am slightly disappointed in the lack of characters like Gambit and Psylocke (Yes, I collected X-Men in my younger days), I was overall happy with the way the film was finished. The casting directors could not have produced a better person to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart while Ian mcKellan convinced the audience that the only way for humanity was his way and no other. I envisioned Wolverine to be physically larger than Hugh Jackman, however, his quick wit and wry smile fit the role better than expected. Yes, there were several discrepencies between the comic book and the movie itself, but definitely a good effort. Halle Berry as Storm? W..O..W. Her every appearance seemed to command respect from fellow mutants alike. Funnily enough, there were even cameos for those of you who are more familiar with the X-Men. Exactly who appears I will not say for the benefit of those who have yet to watch this movie, but keep your eyes open and you'll recognize many characters, both new and old. All in all, a good movie with stupendous efforts from the cast, producers, and the director. While I found the story to be somewhat...lacking, the effects can almost more than make up for this apparent oversight. Personally, I can't wait to see who they decide should be in the next one.",971136000,5,1650,4.792982456140351
1266273,5,B00003CX8I,"I must say that this movie totally surpassed my expectations!  As a long-time X-Men fan, I was expecting an utter horror, either playing too much to the fans so people who've never read the comics wouldn't understand or totally ignoring all established history so fans would be clutching their heads in despair.  This movie managed a nice balance, with enough explanation for people who've never *heard* of the X-Men to understand it, yet attention to history and a few in-jokes for the fans.
The only complaint I had was with Storm, who was an incredibly weak character played totally ineffectually by Halle Berry.  And what was with that accent?  The interplay between the other characters was perfect, including the relationship between Scott and the Professor and the Scott/Jean/Logan love triangle.
I heartily recommend this movie to anyone, whether or not you're an X-Men or sci-fi fan.  Fun for all!",971136000,,906,5.053691275167785

I have always been a huge comic fan and because of this I almost did not attend X-Men the Movie because of D.C. predecessors such as Superscam / Flatman and Spleen and lets not even start with Supergirl.  How refreshing to find a hero based movie with (a) a plot (b) enough continuity for the die hard fans and enough introduction for newcomers and (c) a talented cast second to none - Hugh Jackman as Wolvie was a surprisingly awesome move and I'll wager he who said ""no"" to the role will be kicking himself.  It would have been nice to see Patrick take a more active role but maybe this will occur in the sequel - there has to be a sequel.

1266277,5,B00003CX8I,"This looks like pretty much a good TV episode, basically. A two hour, incredibly expensive, special effects laden, with basically good acting TV show. A movie, I believe, should never expect a sequel, even if it is absolutely certain that a sequel is coming. Starship Troopers did it, and that was incredibly annoying: though that wasn't the only problem with Starship Troopers. The only movie that's ever done it successfully was Empire Strikes Back, which could have been the last movie in the series. The Rebels, for all we knew, could have jumped out into hyperspace and never come back to the galaxy. Phantom Menace did it horribly, though; even the same director can't pull it off more than once. This one BEGS for the next episode. Which would be great if this was a television program, but it ain't. If they could punch one of these out every year, or every six months, I wouldn't mind so much. But there should have been some kind of concrete ending, not ""I'm going off, everythings unfinished"". Still, a great, great showing. And INCREDIBLY faithful to the comic. And the Rogue-Wolverine relationship was great. I loved it, and I mean loved it. Though I was dissapointed that she wasn't as much of a babe as in the comics, but then you can't have everything. Well, good DVD, good movie, etc. Hugh Jackman should go on to great things from this, because I saw some great potential beyond pure action.",970876800,2,1409,4.708502024291498
1266278,5,B00003CX8I,"In any group there can be found extremists and throughout history the most common type is the ""kill the strangers"" brand of fanatic. In the X-Men, we are introduced to a new group of humanity, mutants. These people are born with gifts and curses that set them apart from their neighbours. It is no surprise to learn that the rest of humanity is rumbling  and in the best tradition of politics, one Senator stands up to be counted. Senator Robert Jefferson Kelly has made it his mission to track and control the dangerous and secretive mutants. If you replace the word ""mutants"" in his speeches with ""Jews"", you would get a clear Nazi feel for it all.

The scriptwriters clearly borrowed a lot from Nazi Germany, not the least of which was the opening scene. A crowd of Jews is being herded into a concentration camp, complete with ominous smokestacks in the background. In the crowd, a young boy is separated from his parents as the gates close, the quota being filled. The boy is distraught and struggles to reach his parents. What is surprising is how successful he is, dragging two soldiers along the muddy road. Then we realise that the wire fence is bending towards him, being twisted as if by a giant hand. This miracle abruptly ends as yet another soldier slams the but of his rifle into the boy's face.

Powerful images abound in the film. But at no stage is it heavy handed. This is one of those great stories where things are not always clear. We feel sympathy for the most violent and aggressive character in the film, Magneto. He may want to kill or transform the greater bulk of homo-sapiens but all the  time, we know he is that little boy who survived the holocaust. Even the bigoted and opportunistic Senator gets our sympathy when he is imprisoned and subjected to experimentation by Magneto. What's even scarier is that some of the good Senator's speeches actually made some sense. ""These mutant children have powers more dangerous than hand guns. We don't allow guns in schools, do we?""

Not all mutants want to dominate humanity. There is a group in Westchester being led by a wheelchair bound Professor named Charles Xavier. A mind reading mutant himself, he runs a school for the gifted that also doubles as a base for the X-Men. What do his students do when they graduate? Why, they use their talents for good, fighting crime and injustice. Luckily they have avoided the spandex accessories in their super hero careers, opting instead for form hugging black leather. Where do I sign up?

The film has a large cast of important characters. Given the scope of the comic series, on which it is based, that is unavoidable. As the franchise develops, this will only become more of an issue. However, the story focuses mainly on one mutant, Wolverine, and we are encouraged to see most things  through his eyes. Otherwise known as Logan, he is a great character and his main gift seems to be a long-burning anger at the world. If you're angry all the time, it comes in handy to have six spring-loaded blades that can sprout from between your knuckles. Just the potential for damage forces us to carefully watch his every move. I was quite pleased when Hugh Jackman got this role. He's a talented Aussie actor and for those that aren't aware, he has a good singing voice as well.

There's little point is describing all the characters in the film, although I would like to single out Anna Paquin for special praise. There are many powerful roles and they are all interesting. All except Dr Jean Grey, Famke Janssen, who doesn't do a whole lot of important things during the film. Since, in the comics, the good doctor developed into, Pheonix, one of the most powerful mutants, I look forward to seeing her spread her wings in the future. In fact, there is so much that needs exploring, after watching this enthralling film, that I hope they make another ten.",970704000,3,3874,4.6535087719298245

Wolverine is the best character, and was kept in the mainstream of the plot,including a small look at the Weapon X story (a wolverine story in the comics, about his orgins).

To a true X-Men fan,you miss main characters,Colossus,Gambit,Nightcrawlerand Bishop who were questionably left out of the Movie,but exciting performances by Wolverine,Storm,Magneto,Sabretooth,Mystique,& Toad compensate for the loss. The Movie follows the prejudice judged against these unusual ""mutant"" beings with strange powers who must also face a vengeful Magneto and his Brotherhood Of Evil who decided Humankind will never accept their kind. The attacks are sudden and swift,the excitement & suspense builds to a climax and the Special Effects are as good as it gets. You don't need to be an X-Men fan to enjoy this action-packed movie.

It is a movie in which a frog man devours a bird with his cartoon tongue, after all. It's this magic trick of  tone that gives the movie its staying power, and it's a tone that today's Marvel Cinematic Universe has continued to make use of. Something that those films don't do as well, however, is the human drama. X-Men nails this as well thanks to director Bryan Singer. He brings the character-driven focus of an indie film to what would otherwise be a goofy sci-fi flick.

With the hindsight of all the superhero films that have followed in the decades since, this is, dare I say it, an important film. It showed the way for all those huddled super-powered masses yearning to breathe free.",1519689600,,869,4.7105263157894735
