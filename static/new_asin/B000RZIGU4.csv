8203338,5,B000RZIGU4,My wife and I can't get enough of John Travolta.  He is just fabulous in this trio film feature and is great as usual.  I have every DVD that he's in and will buy each and every movie that he does in the future.  Did I mention that I love these movies?  That would be a definite YES!  Get your popcorn and kick back to three really good movies.  Its worth every penny!  Thanks.,1269216000,3,377,4.013513513513513
