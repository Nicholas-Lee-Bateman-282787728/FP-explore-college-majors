8616628,3,B00FL5NRIQ,"Jump is an ambitious film, tying together four unlikely characters together on one New Years Eve. At a run time of one hour and fifteen minutes, whilst never feeling rushed, the character's are never truly explored. We have a depressed and suicidal lead, played well by Nicola Burley, a pair of bumbling crooks, a crime boss, a criminal haunted by his actions, a vengeful man and a pair of friends looking for a good time. The cast is far too large to focus on just one character, and the film chops and changes to another's perspectives far too quickly, and it's hard to relate to any of them. It was all or one, and unfortunately, all of the character's cluster the film. Adding that the film is not in chronological order, makes it feel far too muddled. They are all well portrayed and written, only we don't ever get the time to know them, and there's no reason to be hooked into the narrative.

The settings are dark and drab too, which does not make good viewing for the eyes. It is New Years Eve and spread around seedy clubs in Ireland, so it looks right, but not nice. Plot-wise, it's tied together all too neatly, and it some of the events feel contrived in order to get all of the character's stories to form one big story. The plot isn't too big for all the characters. Everyone knows everyone and everything fits too perfectly. At times it should feel like the contrivances are clever, but they are still contrivances.

Although I've focused on the negatives, Jump is still a decent film. My concentration drifted as I watched it, but there's still enough for a viewer to grab upon, even if it's tangled and messy with too many characters and stories, but tied up far too neatly in a story that shouldn't be so compact.",1388707200,,1732,4.495238095238095
