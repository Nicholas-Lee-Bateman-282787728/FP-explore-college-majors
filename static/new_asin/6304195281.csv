804626,1,6304195281,"Other than Liv Tyler's beauty, there was nothing redeeming about this movie.  Sure, Tuscany is beautiful (which is also why Frances Mayes' books are hot sellers these days!!), and Jeremy Irons is a veteran actor of high  caliber. The 70s music didn't hurt. Bertolucci's name naturally  ""sells"", but when I saw this movie, I was like, WHAT IS  THIS???????",930787200,6,354,4.9491525423728815
804627,2,6304195281,"It's like a dirty old trust-fund man's film, licking his lazy, narcissistic chops over the coltish, not-spectacularly talented Liv. Reasonably pretty in a banal way, but there's an awful lot of near-inadvertently campy, jaded-bohemian carrying on (which, admittedly, has its appeal). Rachel Weisz makes an appealing debut, though. If you're eager to sample the magic of Bertolucci, skip this and try ""Last Tango,"" ""The Spider's Strategem,"" ""The Conformist,"" or ""Before the Revolution.""",930268800,4,485,5.75

 18 years later, I can't count how many times I've viewed this movie. I identified so much minus the interesting artistic characters and beautiful location. I just bought a digital copy since I rarely watch dvds, and I want to watch it again. Highly recommend for those mature enough to handle nudity and complex issues.",1499558400,,462,4.3604651162790695

804886,4,6304195281,"This is a hidden beautiful film by a maestro filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci.
You don't know him? Oh come on.
He made films like <LAST TANGO IN PARIS><THE LAST EMPEROR><1900><THE CONFORMIST><THE DREAMERS> and so on.
I happened to have most of his movies and every movie he made happens to have it's own way of becoming a classic film.

This is a beautifully shot, romantic, sexual not in a flashy way but more of a production design and above all enviornmentally.
As always Liv Tyler is most gracious in the movie as you remember her from the movie <LORD OF THE RING trilogy> you will have more idea who she is and how she appears to be. She is not an actress who appears to be cheap all nude girl.
Just seeing her in the screen is a bless. Although from some of the angle she looks totally different and she doesn't look beautiful at all which is abit odd.
She is not a superstar image and she will never be one but as I said, she is going to be survived in Hollywood because of her angel like look.
All the others include Jeremy Irons are charming in this movie.

The story is also lovely one.

After her mother's death, Liv Tyler comes to Italy to a small country side a beautiful land a stunning to look at.
She came here to have her look painted by this man. But the real reason is a few years before she met this guy who she had an eye on and she also received a letter from him. She wanted to meet him again.
But finally when she met him and about to have her first late experience- she was 19 and never been sexed- she realized that it was not comfortable and he was not the one.

With the dying man-Jeremy Irons- having an eye on her and all, she had quie a time in the house staying, participating party and all.
Experiencing a nude party, watching peaple having sex without even bother to close their door at night.
Everything seems related to sex.
She is more and more curious about love and all.
Then finally the guy she thought was the one had another friend and he happens to approach her very quietly and finally he confesses that he was the one who wrote a letter before without writing who wrote.
They fianlly meet at night beneath the tree with all the candles lightened. The most romantic background, they fianlly made love, her first experience fullfilled.

This might be the coming of age movie and it's a very beautifully made and also a very smooth one. There is not even a single moment I can tell that is to be fixed or point out that has need to be correction.

It is just perfect and all we have to do is just enjoy the 2 hour of pure beauty.",1465430400,,2568,4.2413087934560325

Aside from that, the script is frightfully boring. Nothing really happens in this movie. The direction and the script are too mellow, and tread too lightly. It is supposed to have that French/Italian feel of being a slice of life and being very natural, but it just plays off as boring. There are movies that actively annoy me and grate on me, and this is not one of them. This one just falls flat and goes nowhere.

805207,2,6304195281,"Bertolucci used to be a decent film maker, somewhere along the frame of his career he got pathetic and pretentious, this is probably related to his acceptance by middle class theater patrons and Hollywood flunkeys after he won the Academy for ""Last Emperor"". I think after he left his Marxist principles and communist leanings, his films sunk to a new time low. Take for example, ""Stealing Beauty"", this must be the most pretentious and bloated of his works.

This film is almost unbearable to watch, it is dreadfully painful even. The characters are nothing but a bunch of spoiled, irreverent, upper middle class pseudo-intellectuals and artists who live out in an Italian country side. Liv Tyler plays Lucy, a sheepish, spoiled teen who wants to lose her virginity as if brushing her teeth. The problem is that Tyler can't act, nor can she pass off as an incredulous youth. She simply is annoying to the point of our exhaustion with her.

One thing good to say about this ostentatiousness is the film cinematography and color which is in contrast to the dull and ridiculous story, and the revolting acting. In every role Jeremy Irons is in, he castigates us with his foreboding and absurdly patrician methods. I've never liked him in any film, and in this one he isn't any better, he mumbles around with diluted solecisms.

805401,5,6304195281,"I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie ""Stealing Beauty"" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called ""apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama."" I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them.
I rewatched the film recently and I loved it even more than  first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness.

This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany.

Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word.  Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, ""Enchanting April"" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies  have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and  unabashedly romantic.

Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity.  She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it.

Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. ""Stealing Beauty"" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.",1343347200,,3130,4.824626865671642
805402,5,6304195281,"Stealing Beauty is a beautiful, sensuous story of love and loss.  Lucy's losing her virginity is the obstensible focus of the plot, but the movie is really about the beauty of loss - loss of a parent, an old friend, a schoolgirl fantasy of the perfect ""first time.""  The scenery is stunning, the soundtrack great, lots of humor and quirkiness, not to mention Liv Tyler's face. Watch this movie a few times - it gets better each time around.",1321488000,,440,4.556962025316456

805406,2,6304195281,"This movie has a tremendous cast, beautiful scenery, positive AIDS awareness & a truly touching relationship between Liv Tyler & Jeremy Irons. So how does it only rate 2 stars?

Most of the characters in this show are caricatures of old lost prejudices about Italians. It shows the Italian people in the same way a fake French accent is used to indicate Marcel Marceau. If a director wants to show drug use shouldn't he make it as real as the AIDS issue he has included? Their reaction to grass was as if they got it from their lawn clippings or a Kansas ditch.

The storyline after the great AIDS relationship is simply locate her unknown father & deal with her virginity issue. Both themes have been done far better many times before. The esteemed director seems to have gone to seed on the thought that if he uses beautiful sets & quirky characters he has fulfilled his job. This movie looks like it was put out by a mill.

The friends, an Irish sculptor and his wife, have an attractive villa in the Tuscan hills which seems to be a gathering place for her mother's artistic and literary friends.

An intriguing entry in her mother's diary suggests Lucy's father was someone other than her husband. Lucy hopes to discover her natural father's identity during her stay at the villa. Lucy's second goal for the summer is to lose her virginity, perhaps in the same olive grove where she suspects she, herself, was conceived.

My problem with this film is that I don't care enough about the characters to be interested in their problems. Many people come and go, often with little introduction or explanation of who they are or why they are there, making it seem as though the audience is being excluded from the goings-on. Even after a second viewing, I still do not know who some of the characters were.

805510,4,6304195281,"Bernardo Bertolucci is one of those directors you either love or hate.  He can easily rub someone the wrong way with his exploitation and ceaseless explicit content, but when one understands the message behind Bertolucci's apparent sensual frustrations he can be appreciated for much more than he is usually regarded as.  His films are not mere `skin flicks' as some have felt the need to wrongfully accuse them of being.  In fact, some of his films are sheer masterpieces (`Last Tango in Paris' is above and beyond one of the best films ever made) and even those that fall somewhat short of his intellectual reaching (`The Dreamers' was close but yet so far from his potential) are still much more than meets the eye.  `Stealing Beauty' is one of his weaker films, for it doesn't have the emotional or even the political depth of his other work, but it still manages to carry itself rather well and touches upon much more than bare skin.

The story is a coming of age tale that revolves around a nineteen year old virgin named Lucy.  After her mother's suicide, Lucy travels to Italy to visit friends of her mothers.  Her mother had journeyed to this artistic retreat twenty years prior and had become pregnant with Lucy, so Lucy's agenda in visiting is to find her real father; and lose her virginity.  There are many different individuals whom she meets and forms friendships with, including Ian, the serious sculptor who is intrigued by Lucy's innocence, as well as Alex, the dying guest who stimulates Lucy intellectually.

And then there are a slew of young Italian boys who find her just utterly delicious.

While the film centers itself on Lucy's libido and her desire to lose that prized possession known as her virginity (why are we so quick to give away something so precious) it isn't merely about that act.  While staying at this home Lucy is given a glimpse a life very far removed from her own; a life of carefree passions and removed from all scrutiny.  There are scenes where characters parade about in the nude; no one reluctant but everyone comfortable and content.  It appears shocking to some and maybe even repulsive, but the truth of the matter is that Bertolucci is trying to show the contrasting variables of self contentment.  As an American culture we are often guarded, as if we are afraid to expose ourselves to others.  The fact that everyone at this house is that open, even the unfit and or older ones, shows that there is a level of self respect and love that is not found in a lot of individuals today.

The acting is all pretty well done, with only a few missteps.  Sinead Cusack and Rachel Weisz stand out amidst all the pretty faces as two very talented and very moving actresses.  Liv Tyler is gorgeous and has a sense of restraint needed to carry her character, but she does at times get lost in the scenes.  A lot has been said over Jeremy Irons performance, but personally I didn't find him nearly as moving as the late Donal McCann who handled Ian with such fervor.  He really understood how to embody his character with the right amount of smoldering sensuality that made him utterly irresistible.  His eyes were just downright piercing.

This is no where near as deeply investing as `Last Tango in Paris', but it is much more than some reviewers have made it sound.  This is not a `boring film only good for a shot of Tyler's goods' but a sensible and honest portrait of a young girl finding herself amidst people who truly understand what it means to be free.",1237766400,8,3504,4.625201938610663

The cast is very good together as well, and the film really does have a nice ensemble quality even if Liv takes up the majority of screen time. I bought the DVD after watching on IFC, and the television version has english subtitles when Italian is being spoken. The DVD does not, as many others have mentioned. This is very annoying, because you do lose some sub-plot information by not knowing what is being said between characters speaking Italian.

I would have loved to have seen a director's cut with commentary. Anyway, regardless, this is a great film for any time you want to really escape for a couple of hours. The film is such that after you've watched it, you feel as if you've become one of the summer house guests. I think I read another review somewhere that was critical of the fact that this area of Italy is shown as being ""old country"" and that these areas are much more urbanized than portrayed. However, I think this is actually being addressed in the film when they show the television station/towers being built and comment on it.

All in all, I do love this film. I love watching it, I love watching certain scenes, and it's very, very relaxing!",1230336000,4,1240,4.53125
805513,3,6304195281,"Stealing Beauty stars Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, and a host of talented Italian actors. (I only mention the names preceding because those are probably the names you will recognize. Other than Tyler and Irons, most of the substantial roles seem to have been performed by Italian actors.)

At any rate, Tyler stars as Lucy Harmon, the 19-year-old, virginal daughter of a famous poet who has recently committed suicide. Lucy, upon going through her late mother's things, finds evidence that the man she thought was her father is not, indeed, her father. Her mother's notes suggest that an Italian man is Lucy's true father. Curious, Lucy goes to an art colony (of sorts) in Italy that her mother used to frequent to find out more.

There, we are introduced to a bohemian way of life and an eccentric cast of characters. Lovable Alex (Irons), a writer with a terminal illness, becomes fast friends with Lucy. As the summer progresses, Lucy discovers the identity of her father and finds her first love.

This film is beautifully shot. It takes a nostalgic, romantic view of Italy and the artist's life. The film explores the concepts of love, secrets, and youth. I enjoyed watching most of it, though there was a bit too much nudity and profanity for my taste. This is definitely an adults-only film, but there are some good performances (notably Tyler, Irons, and a solid turn by Sinead Cusack) that make the film worth watching.

(The film actually reminded me a bit of an arty version of those old ""losing your virginity"" movies of the 80s. It's sort-of the same concept, but treated with a loftier, more serious tone and set in a MUCH more atmospheric location.)",1220140800,2,1690,4.817241379310345
805514,3,6304195281,"Stealing Beauty is about Lucy Harmon (Liv Tyler), who goes to Italy to have her portrait done. Actually, a sculpture carved in wood with a chain saw. Do we ever see it? I don't think we ever do, but by then it isn't really so important. The portrait is the film, a portrait of a beautiful but awkward young woman, and the writers, artists, and Italians who come to this beautiful Italian villa for various reasons.

Lucy has other reasons for coming here besides sculpture, too. Her mother, Sara Harmon, was a poet who committed suicide. From her mothers notebooks she infers that she may have been conceived here, in an olive grove atop a hill. She wants to find out who her real father is, and the likely candidates are all here as well. Not only does she want to find out who her father is, she would also like to lose her virginity, hoping for the right person and a suitable beautiful setting.

It is a beautiful setting, but for some, like English playwright Alex (Jeremy Irons) who is aged and infirm, there is little to do but gossip. Others have affairs of their own to occupy them, but they are not immune to gossip either, and Lucy's virginity becomes a subject of intense interest.

Director Bernardo Bertolucci began as a poet, worked for Pier Paolo Pasolini as assistant director, and switched from poetry to films, but approaching film more as poetry. His best film is The Last Tango in Paris (1972), but The Last Emperor (1987) walked away with nine Academy Awards. Stealing Beauty is not up to that caliber, but it isn't as bad as you think it is going to be when you first see Liv.

She seems like a dork, and all the men seem like lecherous creeps, especially Irons. You are expecting a big train wreck, that Liv Tyler, as beautiful as she is, won't be able to act, and Bertolucci will be arrested for stealing beauty.

For instance, her poetry:

The three poems we see Lucy (Liv Tyler) compose while in Italy are:
1. I have her secret deep within for years I've had to hide I've bought the clues And now I'm hoping To bring the truth outside
2. I wait I wait so patiently I'm as quiet as a cup I hope you'll come and rattle me Quick! Come wake me up.
3. The dye is cast The dice are rolled I feel like **** you look like gold.

For someone who is supposed to be the daughter of a poet, and a character in a film by a director who began as a poet, this is not very impressive. However, Lucy just seems to express herself that way, and it comes natural to her. She doesn't expect to win the Wurlitzer prize for it, she just tears it out of the newspaper she scribbled it on and uses it for a bookmark.

Anyway, Liv Tyler ends up doing a pretty good job of acting in spite of her inexperience, dyslexia, and lack of training. Perhaps she had life experience to draw from. The daughter of Bebe Buell and Steve Tyler, she grew up thinking that Todd Rundgren was her father. Seeing that Tyler's daughter Mia could be her twin, she figured out the puzzle, and had her last name changed to Tyler by age 12.

So, while not Bertolucci's best work, Stealing Beauty is not nearly as bad as Ithought it would be. Alex ends up being not such a bad guy after all, and there are plenty of lecherous creeps, and some that are just plain lecherous, but there are also some decent male characters. Not to mention the female characters, besides Liv. Add all that to the beautiful settings, and I was able to steal a bit of beauty from this movie myself.

805518,2,6304195281,"To comprehend this empty, meaningless drivel, one must  accept, as do the characters in it, the premise that Liv Tyler is a veritable goddess of love.  Unfortunately, as she is stultifyingly dull, inane, superficial, selfish, coy, and vapid, this is impossible.  God only knows why Bertolucci cast her in this role, surrounded by others who can actually act.  Not even consummate pro Jeremy Irons can make his fascination with this simpering whiner sound sincere.

The story is as banal as she is:  teenage Lucy (Tyler) returns to Italy to lose her virginity, dreaming of a sexy young Italian she met at 13.  She does not delight in the Tuscan landscape, study art, or learn Italian, which she insists on pronouncing with an excruciating American accent.  Lucy lodges with a fatuous English sculpture and family who live the kind of `bohemian' life only available to the idle rich.  The boys are beautiful (young Joseph Fiennes is stunning) and, their hormones raging, are after just one thing.

The only thoughtful  character is a middle-aged man dying of AIDS (Irons).  His inexplicable presence and predicament may have been the director's idea of adding `weight' to this fluff.  He and Lucy become friends, though one cannot grasp why.  Perhaps she admires his ability speak in sentences that parse.  Her utter self-absorbtion is forgotten for a moment as he is whisked away to die in a hospital.  But as soon as the ambulance is out of sight, pretty, perky, pouty Lucy quickly comes to her senses and returns to the task at hand:  giving it up.

The only other American in the film is a thoroughly odious entertainment lawyer who, when not on the phone making deals, cheats on his wife at every turn.  Being within earshot, she always catches him.  He follows her around and grovels.

But back to Lucy!  She is a relentless tease and remorselessly leads on her paramour.  When the time comes, however, she spurns him with one last shrill whine of consternation, and flounces out of the room leaving him decidedly 'blue'.

Bertolucci must have been in love to have been this blind.",1204070400,3,2085,4.841359773371105
805649,2,6304195281,"...kind of like Liv Tyler, I guess!

This film is kind of one long homage to her, really...and if she were a more interesting beauty it just might have worked.  While a passable actress, she just doesn't have much going for her other than nice hair, pouty lips, and flawless skin; her eyes are kind of vacuous and bland for the most part, and there's no primal sexual energy underneath...of course she's playing a 19 year old virgin for most of the film so I suppose that was Bertolucci's intent.  Still, she's the kind of demure, quiescent type which just puts you to sleep even if she does look pretty from a distance and simply does not generate much gut-level desire.

Visually, this is indeed a beautiful film, like watching a series of postcards for two hours.  The pacing is very Europeanish-slow of course, and some of the characters rather two-dimensional and predictable.  Lots of artsy fartsy pretentiousness too, which can get a bit tiring, and at times bordered on outright cheesiness.  Some of the cross-cultural bits, like the scene where we are subjected to Liv Tyler bounce and gyrate in her bedroom with her headphones blaring some thrash-type tune, were especially hard to stomach.

Tyler is there supposedly to have her portrait done, though she also has the hidden motive of discovering the identity of a man in one of her mothers poems whom she believes may be her true father. She also seeks love, and it is a fun tale saturated with a heady golden sunlight, flecked with terra cotta sculptures as much a part of the house and land as the residents.

What happened to this director who certainly had a genius and could have been on a par with the Italian giants: Fellini, Antonioni and Pasolini ?

This film is yet another example of a pitiful deterioration that began somewhere in ""1900"" and progressed through ""The Sheltering Sky"" and ""The Last Emperor"".

Often it seems to have been shot by a young amateur. A bunch of not particularly interesting people stuck in a country house, an American virgin trying to have it - there isn't really much to work with. The characters, with a possible exception of that of Jeremy Irons', are shallow, often annoyingly so.

There are too many people, there is no time to explore any of them. The guy who lives deluding himself into thinking that he is a sculptor, is outright pathetic, given the miserably low artistic level of his ""work"".

There isn't really much to write about. If you are a Bertolucci fan, then you should probably see it. Otherwise, you wouldn't lose or miss much.

There are some occasional sequences which reminded me of Bertolucci as he used to be. It has been a pleasure to see Jean Marais. The Italian countryside is of course beautiful. What else ? Well, that's about it.

It is a grossly overrated, pathetically pretentious low-grate production, in my humble opinion. Those bows to Antonioni's ""The Red Desert"", with paint-games, and to ""Blow Up"", with the pantomime actors who are as extraneous to the film as so many other things, only make the show more woeful.

I continue to hope that Bertolucci will come to his senses and remember that he probably still has his genius buried somewhere deep inside. Perhaps, it is a vain hope - but miracles do happen sometimes...",1181520000,5,1858,4.733746130030959

805656,4,6304195281,"""Stealing Beauty"" is a beautiful film, with beautiful people and beautiful, lush settings. The film is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, the Italian director behind films like ""Last Tango in Paris"" and

""The Dreamers."" This film is probably one of his most overlooked. I wanted to get it because I think Liv Tyler is gorgeous and she looks even more beautiful than usual in this film...The movie, judging by reviews I've seen on Netflix, doesn't have a lot of people who like it. One person even remarked that you'd be better off getting a travel video, but this is actually a pretty good film. Tyler plays a virginal 19-year-old girl named Lucy Harmon, whose mother (a poet) has recently passed away and whose father has sent her back to the Tuscan villa inhabited by artists that her mother used to be friends with. The people that own the place are Diane (Sinead Cusack) and Ian (Donal McCann), a sculptor whose sculptures line the yard. Other people are there as well, including Miranda (Rachel Weisz) and her boyfriend Richard (D.W. Moffett)...Also there is Alex (Jeremy Irons), a writer who takes a liking to Lucy. Lucy spends her day writing poetry (that she quickly burns) and looking for insight into her past. She believes that her father is not really HER father and is trying to figure out who is. A lot of people who see this movie will only be seeing it to watch Tyler disrobe...Which she does, but it's not in enough to abundance to be the only reason you see this movie. Even though I liked it, I found myself wondering what was the point? The point of a movie like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is to horrify. The point of ""Pulp Fiction"" is to entertain and electrify. But what is the point of Stealing Beauty? The plot can be summed up in a few words and the movie plays like quiet jazz music. Maybe the 'beauty' in the title sums up this film. It focuses on beauty, but not just exterior beauty. The movie has a lot of beautiful people like

Liv Tyler and Rachel Weisz, but then there's the Jeremy Irons character. He's sick, almost bald, and is always pale but likes to admire the beauty around him. A lot of the characters are into art;

Lucy does poetry, Ian sculpts, Richard acts, and Alex writes...""Stealing Beauty"" is not so much about plot as it is about atmosphere and feeling. The way you might like a gray, rainy day because of how you feel not what the day looks like. Another film that plays like this could become dull, but ""Stealing Beauty"" (for me) was never dull...That could be attributed to the spectacular performances, which are all low-key. Tyler is perfectly cast; she looks so innocent and vulnerable in the film. Irons gives one of his best performances. The man can do more with a whisper than most actors can with a flamboyant speech. It's not perfect, but it is a good film that's easy to enjoy. Just kick back, enjoy the scenery, and bask in the beauty of it.

805658,4,6304195281,"Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci brings that certain European pacing and feel to his movies, even though the past several have been made in English and often with at least one American actor. This means you can expect a great amount of talking and very little action, which can be wonderful if you are in the right frame of mind. He also brings that European attitude toward sexuality and nudity (and no, I am not equating the two), which is to say his actors are fairly uninhibited. He usually peppers his films with a fair amount of nudity and/or sex, and ""Stealing Beauty"" is no exception. It is no secret the average American is much more inhibited about his or her body than the average European, which provides the filmmaker with an opportunity for commentary. American teen, Lucy, visits her family in Tuscany shortly after her mother's passing in order to find her father. She is taken aback, however, when she heads to the swimming pool one day and finds everyone lounging about naked. She declines to join in. Eventually, however, she loosens up enough to expose a breast while posing for a portrait. ""When in Rome..."" (or in the vicinity, anyway). Bertolucci is providing a view of the Italian way of life, or at least those aspects that interest him most, through the eyes of an American. He compares and contrasts the two cultures with details that seem too obvious to even illuminate. It is interesting that Lucy seems to find more in common with some of the Italians she meets than she does with some of the Americans there. Over the course of the film, beauty takes precedence over deeper levels of meaning, though this is not necessarily to the film's detriment. This is essentially a coming-of-age story, with Lucy learning to enjoy life's simple pleasures, including sex. It is evident that Bertolucci finds beauty and pleasure to be of the utmost importance, which makes this subject a perfect fit for him. Liv Tyler is up to the task of carrying this film and the rest of the cast is marvelous as well.

where to start? the performances are great. thus far, this is the only strong performance i've seen from Liv Tyler. I hope she can recreate this. Jeremy Iron weaves gold as always. Many of the other actors deliver powerful, rich performances.

the writing, ideas & dialogue are also intricate, entertaining and thought-provoking. visually, as one would expect, the movie is stunning and being filmed in italy doesn't hurt!

Since a nineteen years old, the lovely and ultra beautiful Liv Tyler decides to visit Tuscana, she will experiment the gradual transformation from her ancient crysallis to become in a real mature woman through those impresive months. She will exchange important encounters with a true caleidoscope of human beings. The art remains and even matchs with the sumptuous landscapes as the huge frame in which the seduction, the pleasure of the good food, the art, the ancient memories in search her dark mother past and her early childhood will lead her to a real grow up process. All the cast is exceptional, but the specia touching acting of Jeremy Irons one of the major actors all over the world plus the admirable directorial work of Bertolucci and his overwhelming employement use of the lenses will astonish you from the start shot of the picture. So considering the sum of all those merits I would say it is imposibble to pretend ignore and least to avoid to fall in love with this supreme artwork.

805801,5,6304195281,"The first time I watched this movie I was about seventeen. And from my considerably nave 17 year old perspective this seemed like a deeply engaging, very interesting and ultimately romantic movie. Though I was not oblivious to the juxtaposition of things traditionally romanticized with less than romantic realities, I was largely distracted by Lucy's own journey to give anything else much thought.  It was likely the first time that I saw a well developed character like Lucy who wasn't the confident bubblegum type of romantic heroine that I was accustomed to seeing. Perhaps that says more about the movies I was watching at the time than anything else, but Lucy's imperfections and awkwardness resonated with me and ""Stealing Beauty very quickly became one of my favourite movies.

Last Sunday, almost ten yeats later, I sat down to watch it again.

I am more aware now of the interesting and at times somewhat fetishistic ways in which Lucy's virginity was treated by the men and women around her. This is just a personal opinion rather than a critique; but there's an interesting ugliness in the men's reactions to Lucy that is more pronounced now that I watch it again. I'm much more interested in the way that characters like Chris, Alex and Nicolo react to (and take advantage of) Lucy (and the idea of Lucy) as well as Lucy's responses to them. And I think that such interesting complexities are a credit to the way that Bertolucci tells his stories as a director.

 The scenery is certainly stunning and one could spend the whole film wishing one was in the location, just as well really given their is no plot to entertain you. The film labours under the misguided aprehension of being a modern telling of the muse story and the woeful, scarred muse with a deep dark secret at that. The problem is Tyler does not have the requisite skill or understanding to carry off such a role, so she appears to be rather wet and misplaced. Amongst the rest of the cast are some heavy weight performers but they are not used properly and no one reeks of artisitc flair or ambition, they all come across rather as bitchy and perverse and the kind of people a good hard day's work wouldn't sort out (not to mention a slap around the face or two!)

Liv Tyler is beautiful, but that isn't what makes this film beautiful. It is the director, it is Italy, it is the scenery, it is the the observance of the sensual in life, and yes also the story. I worked at Blockbuster while in college and every person who was too lazy to read a back cover would ask for my recommendation and when I suggested this movie or to name a few-Titus, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Laurel Canyon, Swimming Pool, Frida, Last Temptation of Christ, Personal Velocity-they would ask to see it and when I took them to the single box-they were put off.

805957,2,6304195281,"Bertolucci used to be a decent film maker, somewhere along the frame of his career he got pathetic and pretentious, this is probably related to his acceptance by middle class theater patrons and Hollywood flunkeys after he won the Academy for ""Last Emperor"". I think after he left his Marxist principles and communist leanings, his films sunk to a new time low. Take for example, ""Stealing Beauty"", this must be the most pretentious and bloated of his works. This film is almost unbearable to watch, it is dreadfully painful even. The characters are nothing but a bunch of spoiled, irreverent, upper middle class pseudo-intellectuals and artists who live out in an Italian country side. Liv Tyler plays Lucy, a sheepish, spoiled teen who wants to lose her virginity as if brushing her teeth. The problem is that Tyler can't act, nor can she pass off as an incredulous youth. She simply is annoying to the point of our exhaustion with her. One thing good to say about this ostentatiousness is the film cinematography and color which is in contrast to the dull and ridiculous story, and the revolting acting. In every role Jeremy Irons is in, he castigates us with his foreboding and absurdly patrician methods. I've never liked him in any film, and in this one he isn't any better, he mumbles around with diluted solecisms.

While I enjoy this film for both its plot and its artistic/aesthetic qualities, I have to admit that it is at its most stunning best when it comes to its cinematography. what a gorgeous backdrop for a virgin coming-of-age story! the plot may be a bit tired, and the characters too well known, but the twists that are supplied are enough to make it engaging. Liv Tyler is, of course, gorgeous and mesmorizing. The Italian and British actors that flank her almost eclipse her, but as her debut film, she does truly shine.
There are several scenes that are physically intriguing, but I most enjoyed the entire ""party"" sequence.... some odd, yet stunning filming.
Let's face it, everyone in this film is beautiful to look at (even  Jeremy Irons as a dying man). You begin to lose interest in Lucy's (Tyler) quest at some point, but once the answer is revealed it is  still somewhat satisfying.

This film is a masterpiece, a fusion of love, lust, beauty and sensuality.  It touches you in a way you'd never expected, giving you a window into Liv's soul (I can't remember the name of her character name... once again, I saw this movie a year ago).  And into a time in her life which is unique in it's beauty: the time in which her sexuality is blossoming.

It makes you feel like you are actually visiting that country. I am not hot on slow movies unless they are weird or mind stretching, but this one is really interesting to watch. Expecially to see a beautiful woman for once struggling with passion and sex! And it has some comic relief in it as well! The tactic's that some of those men used to try to get her in bed, was completley Uproarious! Liv Tyler pertrays such a virginal and Innocent performance. There isn't any huge nudity parts in this film, she only shows her upper torso. But anyway I love this movie alot every sense I rented it I have missed looking at it. Which means this title will be purchased very shortly! The party scene was so beautiful, to see the dance culture and the various personalities at the event. This is definitley a atmosphere movie just as ""Under the Cherry Moon was which was filmed in France. Definitley if you are a cultural person and you like eye candy this is the film to get.

806150,4,6304195281,"After a trio of exotic disappointments (The Last Emperor, The Sheltering Sky, Little Buddha), director Bernardo Bertolucci teturned to his native Italy for the first time in fifteen years with Stealing Beauty.  The result is his most intimate film since Last Tango In Paris, a coming-of-age tale in which 19-year-old Lucy Harmon (Liv Tyler) travels from America to Tuscany to spend time with family friends following her mother's suicide.  She has a couple of ulterior motives for taking the trip--to discover the real identity of her father and lose her virginity to Niccolo, an Italian boy who was her first love as a young teenager.
The story is a flimsy construct but it's well supported by Tyler's appealing, open performance, some sharp playing from Jeremy Irons, Donal McCann and Sinead Cusack, and Darius Khondji's supple, deep focus photography.  Bertolucci relies a little heavily on music cues to telegraph emotions but he's in full control of this subtle tale, which proceeds in a languorous daze to a tender and touching close.  There are those who still bemoan the director's forsaking of political themse to concentrate wholly on the personal, but the film-making skill and the understanding of the human heart apparent in such films as The Spider's Stratagem and The Conformist are still very much in evidence here.  It may focus on the soul rather than the state, but Stealing Beauty feels just as important as anything Bertolucci has made in the past.",1022630400,36,1469,5.053719008264463

Liv Tyler seems to have been erected out of cartoonish characters and her's acting abilities are not a single inch more valueable. On the other hand she's has a particular beauty which should itself be appreciated.
Irons is as usually brilliant and Weiss proves beyond doubt she was grossly undercasted in that unspeakable cheap stupidity known as ""The Mummy"". The scences of her having sex are in fact one of the most exciting i've seen recorded. It is raw sex beyond hypocrisy and pornography. Scenery is glorious, but keep in mind they further reinstate the bucolic image of peasant Italy which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with reality. Anyone who visited Italy's countriside must have been a fool not observe the portruding industrialization and modernization present even in the most remotened region high on the mountains.
One more thing: the presence of despiteful Rock ""music"" into its soundtrack automatically downgraded the movie from an overall 4/5 to a mediocre 3/5 stars...",1018915200,2,1105,5.043715846994536
806154,5,6304195281,"This is an artistically well-done movie if there ever was one.  In fact, I don't think it would be going too far to call it Bernardo Bertolucci's best movie.
The film centers around an American girl (Liv Tyler) who travels over to Italy to visit her relatives.  While there, she gains the friendship of an older writer (Jeremy Irons) who is dying of cancer.  Tyler exudes a youthful, natural and yet mysterious beauty which complements Irons' masculine, distinguished screen-presence quite nicely.  In many sequences, Tyler is photographed so elegantly that she appears to be a model for one of Boticelli's paintings.
Juxtaposed with this bonding is the desire for Tyler's character to lose her virginity.  In this rite-of-passage, her dying friend becomes her mentor.  They both want it to be ""special,"" but she is also tempted to just ""do it"" with the efficacy of becoming a complete woman.
As the cover of the DVD shows Liv Tyler nude, a lot of guys are probably wondering if this is a movie in which she actually bares anything.  The answer is......yes!  There are a few brief scenes in which she is topless.  To my knowledge, this is the only film in which she appears nude.
Filmed on the sun-drenched verdant rolling green countryside of Italy, the movie is colorfully illustrated by vibrant contrasts of red and green.  The cinematography goes a long way towards giving the story a distinctly Italian flavor.
So, if you're Italian, like Italian stuff, enjoy aesthetically pleasing films, admire Jeremy Irons or have a crush on Liv Tyler, this movie is for you.  If none of these things appeal to you, this probably is not a DVD for you.",1016841600,120,1643,4.8113879003558715

Not only it helped Tyler shake off her failure in previous films (""Heavy"" and ""Silent Fall""), it gave her and Weisz a good leverage to box office hits thereafter (like ""The Mummy"" and ""Lord of the Rings""). So Bernardo Bertolucci deserved all the credit here. In fact, the cast and cinematography were quite enjoyable. However, when it came to  Bertolucci's portrayal of life through the eyes of artists (and people connected with them in one way or another), I couldn't help thinking of Federico Fellini. I believe Bertolucci is almost as good as Fellini, just one small step short. After watching ""Stealing Beauty"", I logged on to search for ""La Dolce Vita"" and pre-ordered the DVD right away.

Not a lot of help.

806328,4,6304195281,"Often this or that work is referred to as ""transitional"" but with ""Stealing Beauty"" this term actually applies.  Moving from the somber, epic melancholy of his Eastern Trilogy films, Bertolucci here breaks off his collaboration with world's greatest cinematographer Vittorio Storraro and begins the reinvention of his cinematic style that would soon find flower in his latest masterpiece ""Besieged"".  With ""Stealing Beauty"" he is first exploring his new, romantic and youthful mood and deconstructing the lilting, adagio-like crane shots that have represented the full glory of his style.  This film never attains the speed and light of ""Besieged"" but you can see the beginnings of it at far-flung moments, like with the montage that is spun from Lucy's notebook and the Tuscan countryside.  For a film whose watchwords were supposedly ""Jean Renoir"" and ""Mozart"", ""Stealing Beauty"" never quite finds the lightness of touch that it seeks (and the alternative music dates the film badly-- even at the time of release it felt a bit incongruous, as though the Old Master were trying on glad rags, a bit like Godard turning Botticelli's Venus into a rollerskateing babe).  But never mind-- Bertolucci on a slouching day beats even some legendary directors at their best.  ""Stealing Beauty"" is graced with gorgeously deep greens and browns, courtesy of the gifted, though in other movies sometimes misguided, Darius Khondji.  Liv Tyler does everything the role of Lucy requires of her-- and no, she doesn't just have to pout and look pretty. Jereme Irons broods with the expected finesse, and Jean Marais scene-steals terrifically. Rachel Weisz earns her place in the Bertolucci Hall of Fame for nude actresses with her scene as an enticing poolside odalisque. The film, if shaky at times, manages to persuade us of Lucy's idealism and the inspiring quality of her beauty.  This is richly apparent in the dreamy sequence where Donal McCann gets her to bare a breast-- admire the interplay of the other characters, Daisy feeling left out and beating a tree, Richard acting predictably aroused beyond belief, etc.  This languor is ultimately the film's strength.  The characters may sometimes be too narrow to be likeable, but the mood lifts them above themselves.  As for Bertolucci, he may be a bit uncomfortable being too sweet and innocent: there's a fine moment late in the film where a woman takes it upon herself to show Lucy what the 'Marquis de Sade' character REALLY likes that feels as though the earthy Bertolucci of the '70s decided to push in and add some perversity to the proceedings.  But it's nice of him to go with Lucy on her journey of awakening (as though I even need mention what the film is ""about""!) and, though for him a ""minor"" work, ""Stealing Beauty"" can be chalked up as some kind of classic.",1011916800,3,2813,5.0

806333,4,6304195281,"This is a wonderfully shot film that stars Liv Tyler, and other notable actors such as Jeremy Irons.  It is a typical coming of age story, set in the middle of a beautiful Tuscan landscape.  Living in an almost hippy commune full of artists and writers, Tyler tries to find herself and most importantly become a woman and lose her virginity.  Under the guidance of Irons, she learns more about men, life and it's brevity.  Her true dream is to reunite with her childhood love, but as in real life, she finds that sometimes things are better left in one's imagination.  Instead she finds what she was most looking for is right there practically under her nose.  With a great soundtrack that includes the music of Portishead, I recommend this film highly.",997660800,2,753,4.666666666666667

806539,5,6304195281,"This film is really quite unique; I must admit that the plot is a little dubious and winding (kind of leaves you wondering ""what's the purpose?"").  However, after you get into the movie, you're not too  concerned with the plot per se.  Watching this film is like admiring a  painting.  It's more about emotion, atmosphere, and most of all, beauty,  than it is about a particular story.  Like the title suggests, this film is  about beauty.  Beauty is presented in many forms; it is in the rolling  hills of Tuscany, and it is certainly within the sinfully seductive and  heavenly Liv Tyler.  I believe it was the director's meaning to portray Liv  Tyler as ""beauty incarnate""; the very essence of feminine  perfection.  No one could have played this role better than Liv Tyler.  She  is so breathtakingly beautiful that one feels guilty staring at her so  intently.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the director attempted to  prove that losing one's virginity can be a beautiful thing, and I admire  this refreshing point of view.",961718400,,1036,4.7727272727272725
806540,4,6304195281,"In this 1996 film, Liv Tyler makes her stunning debut. Set to a soundtrack that is a good  mix of quintessentially '90's music (a la Portishead and Liz Phair) and retro classics (like ""My Baby Just Cares For Me""  and ""I'll Be Seeing You,""), this film takes both Liv's character,  Lucy, as well as the viewer, on a journey into mystery and enchantment.  Lucy embarks on her journey to Italy after the death of her mother, a  famous poet and artist. She travels there in search of greater knowledge  about her mother, who spent a brief few weeks there one summer. But what  Lucy really uncovers in Tuscany are the answers to secrets in her past.  And, as the film goes on, she discovers more and more about herself, and  the woman she is to become. This film is a great, slowly paced meditation  on sex, love, art and self-awareness. When Lucy finds out that she was  ""conceived"" in the olive groves of the artists' villa there, her  curiosity deepens and the search for her birth father becomes one of the  main goals in her journey. Faced with the loss of a future with her mother,  Lucy is looking towards the past for information about those she loves, for  knowledge about herself and where she came from, and for hints about where  this might lead her as she takes on the life of an adult.
The film begins  with shots of Lucy sleeping on the train on her way to Tuscany. There is  even one devilish strategic close-up shot of her jeans which is perhaps  explained later in the film when it is revealed in a comical exchange  between Lucy and Jeremy Irons' character that the beautiful 19 year old  Lucy is a virgin. Unbeknownst to Lucy, she was being taped on her journey  by a fellow passenger on the train. But he gives her ""beauty""  back to her in the form of the videotape. Her fate is still in her hands.  From there, the film follows several slow, melodic plot lines, one of which  is the attempt to find the perfect first sexual partner for the young and  much-loved Lucy.
Liv plays a perfect beauty here. She is innocent,  touching, bright, curious, and passionate, and as the film goes on, she  takes a cue from the artists at the villa and becomes and more free in her  expression, more comfortable in her own skin. But she is also careful. She  wants her passion to be shared with someone worthy of it, someone who gives  as well as takes. It takes a while for her to find out who that perfect  catch is, but as in life, the story is what happens while she is  waiting  for the ""pay-off.""
Her curious habit of striking a match to  each finished poem and burning it up seems to say that she is not yet  confident in her artistic abilities, that she wants to keep some things  sacred, private. She is cautiously awaiting sharing herself on a deeper  level with those whom she grows to love.
Jeremy Irons' character, a man  struck by illness in the most beautiful of places, is a nice offset to the  virginal beauty of Tyler. Together, they bring the film full circle from  youth and glowing health to the natural course of death and dying. The  attention they pay to one another is mutual. Lucy in this way is wise as  well as youthful.
The countryside in this film is magical. The vineyards  of Tuscany, with the glowing sun above, are lovingly captured by  Bertolucci. The film is as much an ode to youth and innocence, and the  inevitable loss of it (which I think Bertolucci is saying can also be  beautiful) as it is to the Italian countryside.
Others in the film who  have gone on to receive wide acclaim and appear in such movies as  Shakespeare in Love, Elizabeth, Swept From the Sea, and The Mummy are the  two British actors Joseph Fiennes and Rachael Weisz.",960336000,14,3681,4.42089552238806

Though I am a sucker for a lot of soul-searching types of chick-flicks, never before had I been so enraptured by a movie that has been dubbed a chick-flick.  Liv Tyler's acting was commendable,  and the rest of the cast lived up to and beyond the challenge of overcoming  her beauty.  The cinematography was breath-taking and the storyline grabbed  me from the beginning.

1. Lush sceneries of the Italian countryside.
2. The very beautiful, talented and always  watchable Liv Tyler.
3. Great supporting cast (eg. Rachel Weizz,  Jeremy Irons, D.W.Moffet, and  the many  talented Italian actors)
4. Wonderful storyline and  script.
5. Excellent photographic skills. Watching the  movie is like  being in a beautiful dream where  you don't ever want to wake up.
..  and more! I highly recommend this video to anyone who loves  beautifully-made movies with thought-provoking storylines.
The movie's  set in the 1970s. After her mother passes away, Liv Tyler's character (Lucy  Harmon) goes back to Italy (where she first visited 4 years ago) to solve  the mystery of who her real father is (all she has for clue is a mysterious  poem written by her mother when she was still alive). Lucy  also  desperately wants to fall in love and ""give herself"" to a  deserving man. There're several guys vying for her attention. But who wins  her heart in the end? Nicolo? Oswaldo? Christopher? A drunk guy she met at  a party? Watch the movie to find out.. but I'll just like to add that in  the end, Lucy made a wise and excellent choice and I just love her for it!",949449600,21,1199,4.728155339805825

My point is that there's not only a strong eye-candy factor going on here,  but it showcases some notably talented individuals, some like Marais and  McCann in their last (or almost last)roles and some, like Feinnes and  Weitz, early in their careers.  The story isn't much, and Tyler doesn't  contribute much, IMO, but she's pretty enough that shouldn't matter.  The  others take up all the slack so admirably and completely that she's almost  extraneous.  And if they don't capture your imagination, the breathtaking  scenery will.

The movie seems very shallow with a bunch of hippy artist characters living at a villa doing eccentric things. The movie gives you no reason to care about them at all or their strange problems. Instead it takes you on a journey with the main character (lucy) played by Liv Tyler who searches for her father. However, I forgot all about that because the plot seems to deviate from her goal into her trying to lose her virginity to potential guys she sees around villa. That's really the only part that makes any sense in the film because everything else is so random and pointless.

7864294,2,6304195281,"Starts out with 19yo Lucy fast asleep on train alone in northern Italy with her legs spread very wide apart & her hand suggestively placed.  She has good luck, though:  no one gropes her.

She is young girl in search of her own father, whose  identity she does not know.  She should  better have tried attorneys & DNA tests than to try to tease information out of her mom's friends.

These so-called  friends are artistes  living in rural Italy, who Lucy comes to Italy to  visit.  Although her mother is now dead, not one of these friends takes a well-intentioned interest in her daughter.  The relationships among the group are hard to figure out.  The only  person who seems to like Lucy at all  is somebody's 5yo child.

The adults just leer at her constantly.

Each man there sexually harasses her, including her 2  father-suspects and guys old enough to be her grandpa.  After she screams about 5 times, they do desist;  after all they are gentlemen (sort of).

The  older women are as bad as the men;  their intrusive sex questions, and prurient interest in their young guest's virginity is bizarre.

Lucy is allowed no privacy.  The girl can't take a bath without a man's eyes peeping through the window;  she can't cry alone at night without one of the old men stopping by to talk about intimate  topics.

Although Lucy has reached the age of consent;  she is still a minor.  They are just taking advantage of her lack of self-awareness & self-confidence; encouraging her to get drunk and stoned on pot, and treating her like the  stereotype of a French maid in some low-brow comedy.

A weak point in the plot is the question of why Lucy doesn't just leave.  She does decide to leave early on, but changes her mind when she hears that boy she  had a crush on years ago  was going to stop by. She chases him, but he isn't interested.  He is even cruel to her; flaunting his relationships with other girls to her face.  That she would stay only  to prolong her disappointment in this guy is not convincing.

Very late in the movie, a happier situation develops:  Lucy meets up with a  genuinely nice Italian guy,  who is respectful, sensitive & kind.  He has more conservative values than  the lascivious artistes.  The only way to make the ending better would be if they decided to date for a while, and get to know each other  better,  before having sex.

And, she does discover her father;  he turns out to be an old man who had insisted that she pose for him topless.  What's that old saying about being careful what you pray for?

Perhaps this film aimed to be similar to an Eric Rohmer romantic comedy, but its characters aren't developed that well, and they lack the keen social observations, morality & good intentions of Rohmer's main characters.  The film ends without that feeling that you know the characters, or even that you would want to know  them better.",1509840000,2,2878,4.552062868369352
