8051654,5,B0007TV6I4,"What an unexpected gem! GREAT ACTING, for the most part. I was so impressed with the little evel child's acting. She was extremely believable for being such a young actress. I imagine it's hard for kids to get into these rolls, because they've not quite learned about mental illness, and the escalation and extent to what behaviors homicidal people experience. Plus the storyline leaves u constantly torn between loving this poor girl and feeling empathy for her, and then the next moment you're disgusted with the characters actions and rational. Really a great movie. I did not expect it to be any good when I first saw it on YouTube. I usually don't find evil child films very entertaining.  They just don't freak me out or intrigue me. The Horror audiance has been bombarded with over marketing saturation of films like The Omen and The Good Son and every possession/exorcist film that exist, Plus the paranormally driven evil children movies that are a dime a dozen. For my horror tastes, I don't like that niche of films in any way. They just don't interest me. Daddy's Girl was way different than any of those you've ever seen. It seems like this movie is the highly underrated, unrecognized, catalyst of the newer child oriented horror styles such as, The Orphan. This independent low budget gem will keep you shocked at what unfolds as the movie goes on. 5/5 stars. I think even serious mainstream contemporary horror fans would really enjoy this. Give it a try. I'm a huge horror collector and fan, so take it from a serious horror fanatic; It's a good movie. Im so glad I bought it. I now watch it regularly because its just so entertaining.  Anywhoo, I could go on-and-on about this movie. I rated 5stars. Blah blah, K-Thanks-Bye.",1407024000,,1742,4.745874587458746
