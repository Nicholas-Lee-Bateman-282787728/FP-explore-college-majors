7964560,1,B000068TQ3,"Finally gave up an hour into it. Crappy actors, crappy characters, all losers making terrible choices and I have no empathy for any of them. I turned it off because I really did not care what happened next.",1515283200,,206,4.447368421052632

7964565,3,B000068TQ3,"If you are a cynic, you will like this movie. It should also make you think about the connection between Americans and Mexicans. I hearby, declare this to be a cult movie. My main criticism is they could have put Bruce Dern and David Keith to better use. Not a great movie, but some of it told the truth.",1267488000,,304,4.169491525423729
7964566,1,B000068TQ3,"My friend and I saw a preview for this movie with Boondock Saints.  We both loved Boondock Saints so much that we decided to rent If . . . Dog . . . Rabbit . . . after seeing the preview 30 times.  I swear I could feel my IQ drop at least two dozen points throughout the movie, and little did I know my friend felt the same, but we both sat through it for the other's sake.  So yes, I have seen the movie all the way through and it is equally sucky all the way through.  Afterward, while discussing this movie, my friend and I decided that we hated it so much that he took it out into the backyard, put it on a stump, and shot it.  Honest to god.  This movie was beyond bad.  I enjoy Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and this movie was so bad that if I owned a gun I would have shot it a couple times myself.  Save yourself $.35 and 2 hours and just jam sharpened carrots in your ears, its more enjoyable.",1119312000,2,906,3.885869565217391
