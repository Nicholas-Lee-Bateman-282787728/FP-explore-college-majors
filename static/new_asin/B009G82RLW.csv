8541129,5,B009G82RLW,very interesting DVD of first but not the last nuclear power station accident to show people still don't know what they are dealing with in the handling of powers of radioactive material & dangers they possess,1408579200,,209,4.833333333333333
8541130,1,B009G82RLW,"I ordered this because it was promoted as ""Watch and listen as Ron walks you through the TMI MELTDOWN!!""  He does say there was a meltdown, and points to a printed diagram that shows where a valve was closed and should not have been, but that is at most 5 minutes of the 30 minute recording.  The rest of the time is an explanation of why the newspapers got the radiation release info wrong, and why nearby residents get more radiation from -- watches -- gas lamp mantles -- airplane flights -- nuclear bomb testing than was released by the accident.  There is also an urging for the need for more nuclear plants at the end of the video.

It is an interesting discussion from someone who was there, and is confident that nothing dangerous happened to nearby residents of the plant during or after the accident.  But it is truly ""My TMI Story"" as it says on the cover, not a story of the TMI meltdown.",1366156800,2,900,4.365269461077844
