2076300,4,B0002CSBK2,"I purchased this DVD as an unusual activity for an upcoming ""girls night"" party. None of the guests (including myself) have any previous experience with bellydancing. I decided to try it out before the party and was, at first, kind of lost. The instructions were simple enough, I just couldn't get my body to move the way I wanted it to! I have watched the DVD three times now and I'm pretty good at the first three combinations. My only complaint would be that it is impossible to learn all ten combinations at one party, but then if you're more co-ordinated than I am you might not have any problems.",1152835200,9,602,4.4818181818181815
2076301,5,B0002CSBK2,"I bought Belly Dance Party over a year ago and am revising my review. At the time I picked this up, I only had 2 or 3 other bellydance DVDs to compare with. Today I have 64 of them---and still happen to think this one is very impressive.

There are other videos around that will teach you combinations. At three times the price. And at half the usability. So much after I've acquired it, I still think Belly Dance Party is rich in content, and beautifully taught and organized.

What I do not agree with is that these are combinations you can learn ""tonight"". Not really. You need to first work at the isolations that form the basis of these movements. If you're interested in bellydance, get your basics in order with so many of the other excellent instructional videos around (including Neon's own Instant Belly Dancer). If you just want to add some sexy and spicy belly dance moves to your club dancing and have no experience of belly dancing, pay extra close attention to her instructions so that you get the foundation for the move.

You may be able to ""get"" the move, but to make it look good, you'll need practice. Neon's video is unique in the way that it gives practice at 3 different speeds. I haven't seen that elsewhere.

The reason I find these combinations particularly usable is that you can pick up bits and pieces of them, put them into other dances, or just re-string them together in a sequence you like.

The style of these combinations is very Neon. It's also not much like all the other hardened Middle Eastern belly dancing you'll see. The nice thing is, you can modify them to suit your own stuyle quite easily. I, for example, soften a lot of the moves becuase I enjoy slow, sensual dancing.

Overall, this is a very well made video.",1142380800,11,1758,4.495297805642633
2076302,5,B0002CSBK2,"""Belly Dance Party"" is a fantastic way to learn the basics of belly dancing, with Neon giving precise and clear instruction, as she demonstrates in this well produced DVD. She stands before a completely black background, so one can perfectly see every move, and one is also aided by the occasional graphic in the form of circles and arrows. Neon is an exquisite dancer, with a sculpted figure, incredible grace, and a technique that is a marvel. Born in Moscow, Neon speaks with a softly Russian accented English, and has a very pleasing voice, which adds to the overall enjoyment of learning to belly dance with this DVD.

The Combinations:

Neon gives us 10 combinations to learn, which we can learn individually or sequentially, and the choreography is well balanced and uses the entire body, so that no single part gets overly tired, unlike some belly dance instruction DVDs I have tried by other teachers. One can learn these combinations alone or in a group, and they can also be a marvelous body workout. The total time for this instruction is approximately 63 minutes.

The Practice: There are 3 speeds one can practice the combinations in, and in this section, Neon dances with us facing front as well as back, which is very helpful. This section runs in a loop, so you can practice for as long as you like without needing the remote control to replay it.

Extras: ""Welcome,"" where Neon talks about the combinations, the various ways you can learn them, and what belly dancing can do for your life, by increasing your coordination, and much more. ""The Arrival,"" where Neon shows her artistry in a number where she dances with a tray of lit candles on her head. Her body control and liquid movements in this piece are amazing, and to see more of Neon in this type of dance, watch her ""Stellar Body"" DVD.

There are many reasons to try belly dancing; it is fun, and it's great exercise. It is also remarkably adaptable: One can do it in anything from jeans and a T, to one of those sparkly, sensual costumes the pros use, and also barefoot, or in high heels. It takes very little room to do, so if you're in a small apartment, you won't have to move all the furniture to practice your movements, and it will also work with any type of music that has a steady beat. A really nice thing is that belly dancing looks good on those of us who have more than 2% body fat, and is a terrific form of exercise that plus size gals can shine in.",1132185600,29,2440,4.51131221719457
2076303,4,B0002CSBK2,"A lot of people give Neon flak for her video releases not being 'real bellydance' enough.  While that might be true, anyone who has actually tried the combinations she puts together on this video simply MUST admit that it's a heck of a lot of FUN.  The combinations are put together to explore similar moves (hip sways, 3/4 shimmies, etc), and they focus exclusively on hip movements (almost NO upper body use save for one shoulder shimmy), but they are easy to learn.  I've seen lots of beginning bellydance videos, and have to say that the combos you can learn from this video by Neon are far more impressive looking (to your friends on the dance floor) than the usual 'beginner routine'.

While her target audience is clearly the club set, I don't think even the most authentic dancer in the world could fault Neon's technique.  Moreover, I think if they got over the clubby packaging, many dancers might actually learn a few fun and funky combinations.  They work well for the standard american 4/4 beat, but can easily be adjusted to more traditional music.  If you're having a hafla, what could be more fun for dancers not in the spotlight to do a few of these combos?

Many dancers are overly antsy about the reputation of bellydance.  For far too long it's been associated with sleaze and striptease.  I understand where that's coming from.  But none of Neon's moves are sleazy or stripperish.  I think there's enough room in the belly dance lexicon to loosen up and let a few non-hardcore students in.  I can't think of a better way to win new dancers over to the art form than giving them a user-friendly package they can wow their friends with in the clubs.  It's cute, it's harmless, and it's undeniably FUN!",1129680000,21,1720,4.633663366336633
2076304,5,B0002CSBK2,"This DVD is very effective as a belly dancing jumpstart for beginners. Twice I gave it as a gift to friends who were new to belly dance, and in no time they were doing the ""arabic hip walk"" and all the other 3/4 bellydance hip isolations and travel steps Neon teaches in this video, things I used to think were difficult for beginners.  Neon's unique teaching method is the key. She takes challenging moves, breaks them down into simple linear ""trajectories"" and shows them in diagrams overlaid on her body .  Another key is that each and every move is taught in some kind of a combination with another move.  As in learning a language, it's the way you connect the words that really creates the meaning.  I think the comparison to language learning is real: Neon has a masters degree in linguistics.  So, very uniquely for a dance instructor,  she teaches dance like a  foreign language immersion course.  You speak it and think in it - right from the start.",1113091200,27,959,4.567251461988304
2076305,5,B0002CSBK2,"Now I like this one the best the music isn't as boring as the other its uplifting Im able to get into it more, instruction very well as always love the different choices of combinations and repetions.",1104537600,14,200,4.4324324324324325
2076306,5,B0002CSBK2,"What is different and wonderful about this DVD is the way it is set up.  Most DVDs take you through a main choreography, or a series of movements without drilling the way that the movements connect.  I was happy to see the building block system, since that is how I teach beginning classes.

The DVD is divided into ten different mini-routines, which can be quickly learned by beginners (there are some intermediate movements, but they can be easily substituted). There is also a practice section, where you get to dance along with Neon as she goes through each mini-routine, at three different paces.  This is a DVD that won't get dusty on your shelf!

Neon's teaching style is also very explicit and easy to follow.  She mentions both the way to properly execute the move, and also which muscles to focus for maximum effect.  The production is wonderful here!  The lighting is clear and bright, and handy diagrams are placed over each move to show direction! Fabulous!

Neon is also one of the most fluid dancers I have seen in some time, and there is a lovely section where you can sit back watch her dance with a balanced tray of flowers. I didn't even mind the swirly background, it seemed to work somehow--I'm sure this is a credit to the editing.",1097539200,31,1253,4.608108108108108
2076307,4,B0002CSBK2,"This DVD does deliver what it promotes, showing 10 different combinations to learn slowly, without music using computer geometric shapes to show you where/how to move & showing you both front/back views. She teaches in the classic 8-count most professional dancers learn. She seems like a great teacher & seems sweet, but because there was almost too much info, I got a bit lost & the lack of music bored me.
Unfortunately, I have a little trouble learning in such a controlled way, I do easier with just mimicking a teacher while music is playing & she shows half time. The black background also felt a bit cold/distant.

She the most graceful, flexible, relaxed, talented dancer I've ever seen including the bellydance twins Neena & Venna, Raina by a long shot (she's way to stiff) & possibly even Jilliana, and she beats them even with candles balanced on her head!

2076308,5,B0002CSBK2,"This DVD goes with the two other Neon DVDs from her ""Instant Belly Dancer"" set, ""Curves"" and ""Hipwork Plus"".  It uses the same teaching method and visuals, the geometric shapes that follow ""trajectories"" of bellydance movements.  Unlike the ""Instant Belly Dancer"" DVDs, geometric illustrations are given only for more difficult movements.  What I like most about this DVD is that the cute ""Belly Dance Party"" routine consists of 10 separate mini-dances that are particularly easy to learn and show to others.  The whole idea of the DVD is not only teach you the dances, but to enable you to teach your friends how to do these dances too, instantly.  To test out this idea I actually took the two easiest (for me) combinations (they all look really sexy and impressive), learned them the best I could on a Sunday morning, and just went out and started dancing them at my girlfriend's wedding reception that same afternoon.  You can dance them to any music.  It absolutely worked: I ended up teaching the same moves to all the women at the reception including grandmothers.  The ""instant gratification"" aspect is real.  Neon teaches real dancing, real fast.  If you are a fan of the Instant Belly Dancer DVDs, this one is for you.",1088899200,35,1228,4.804761904761905
8026113,1,B0002CSBK2,This video stunk.  I watched it once and never picked it up again!,1419984000,,66,4.076923076923077
8026114,1,B0002CSBK2,I didn't think this video would be as poorly done as it was. It wasn't very useful for exercise so it went back on the shelf.,1357084800,,125,3.8461538461538463
8026115,4,B0002CSBK2,"The belly dance party DVD is nice and easy, If you know how to move your hips around and lock your belly, and drop your hip one at a time, then you will think it's easy to catch on. If you can't do anything listed above, you may have some problems, if so stand in a door way and lock your hands on both sides (holding on to the door frame) this will keep your upper body from moving to allow you to rock your hips. I hope this works.",1266537600,,433,3.8222222222222224
8026116,2,B0002CSBK2,"I only watched this video twice, i cant get past how boring she is. The techniques are  ...nice. She's not detailed enough when she's explaining the movements. Its not well organized either, if I wasn't so busy I would've gotten my money back. But hey if Im bored one day I'll try it again. If I cant get into it by the third try then I'll get rid of it.",1205280000,,354,4.057142857142857
8026117,4,B0002CSBK2,"From the product description, I was not expecting club music or an instructor with a Russian accent.  But it worked out.  Belly dancing is hard!  I, as a person with some dance background, still took a few runs to start getting the hang of each combination.  It's like wriggling---with rhythm and control.  My mother, who has less relevant dance experience, is having much more trouble with it.",1186099200,3,394,4.82089552238806
8026118,5,B0002CSBK2,This is a great Belly Dance instructional/fitness DVD.  I Love Neon's dance style; she is a fabulous instructor and she gives you a great workout.  I really enjoy learning the combinations and applying them to my free dance practice.  I weight train as well but I'm always dancing between sets.  I haven't had the opportunity to use it in a party environment as suggested by Neon but it would be enjoyable.  I'm still trying to get my boyfriend's daughter interested in dancing with me but she's all about hip hop...I told her that most of the female hip hop moves include belly dance these days and that sparked her interest!,1178928000,,626,4.654545454545454
8026119,4,B0002CSBK2,Just that you cannot learn all of those combinations in just one night if you do not have any experience in bellydancing whatsoever...But the combinations are good for an intermediate bellydancer...,1172275200,5,198,5.419354838709677
8026120,5,B0002CSBK2,"This was my first bellydance dvd ever and I am glad for the foundation. The combinations are broken down completely and the visual angles are great which allow for an an easy follow along learning technique. Neon is a good instructor, beautiful, graceful dancer and her costumes are awesome. If you have previous dance experience, these combinations will be easy to master.",1157587200,4,373,5.032258064516129
8026121,4,B0002CSBK2,"I first saw Neon in her 'Instant Belly Dancer' dvd checked out from the library, and liked it so much I bought this one.  The techniques and ideas behind the moves are more clearly explained in the ""Instant' dvd, and that would be a better one to get if you don't know anything about belly dancing yet.  This one uses the moves explained in that, and provides three different speeds plus many different combinations to put into your dancing at clubs, parties or at home. I didn't think I would like Neon, for she is not in the least bit traditional in her approach, dress or labeling, but she does a fine job and provides a vigorous workout as well.  This dvd I gave 4 stars to because I didn't think it was as informative as her 'Instant Belly Dancer' dvd, but it is a fun overall workout and is a decent Supplement to your regular belly dance classes.  Dance is not an easy thing to learn just from a dvd, and I'd encourage anyone interested in belly dance to definitely take a class before taking up a video like this.  A class will provide support and comraderie that you don't get alone, and will make the video make more sense when you do see it.",1155859200,12,1152,4.314814814814815
8026122,5,B0002CSBK2,"i work out regularly and am in pretty good shape - i don't have a perfect bod, but i'm not in anyway unhealthy or an exercise beginner.  this video, for whatever reason, had me sweating in 10 minutes!  i wasn't out of breath or tired, just obviously working muscles that were not used to being worked thru kickboxing or other aerobic activity i usually do.  i don't want to mislead . . . this isn't a ""cardio"" workout, but you are strengthening muscles, burning calories and it's LOADS OF FUN!  i've never done bellydancing before this, but can't wait till i have time to put this dvd back in the player!  the cover is cheesy and i must say, Neon's taste in clothes leave much to be desired, but she's calm, extremely thorough and super easy to follow.  love Neon and love this dvd!",1154563200,9,782,4.395833333333333
