3153724,5,B001675ZJC,"The Backyardigans has to be one of the cleverest, funniest, cutest, and most entertaining kids shows ever created.  An irresistible blend of bright, colorful animation, adorable dancing characters, and catchy tunes makes this show a delight not just for the little ones but also for parents.  It also helps that many of the episodes are sly sendups of shows and movies that are definitely for grownups.

This new disk contains four episodes.  All are delightful but the last two are particularly entertaining.

Match on Mt. Olympus: Just as Pablo and Tyrone are about the take care of the perfect weather and play basketball, the Weather Goddess Tasha decides to rain on their parade--literally.  The two then journey to Mt. Olympus and enlist the help of Austin, God of Laughter and Uniqua, Goddess of Naps.  The samba-style music is fun and the Backyardigans wear some seriously stylish togas.

The Great Dolphin Race: Stable Boy Pablo and Stable Girl Uniqua are happy working at Racer Tyrone's dolphin ranch.  Then Uniqua, who dreams of racing, finds a racing dolphin of her own, enlists Pablo to be her trainer, and challenges Tyrone to a race.  But Uniqua's dolphin has a serious fear that could cost them the race.

Ranch Hands from Outer Space: Tasha is a rancher with more chores than time and so when Zablo and Zuniqua appear at her ranch, she is more than happy to take them on.  The two aliens are eager to earn their pancake reward, though not for the reason Tasha imagines.  This episode is particularly entertaining as Zablo and Zuniqua have some truly unorthodox methods of completing their chores and the '60s Italian pop style music is catchy.

Caveman's Best Friend: Caveman Austin is ecstatic when he finally realizes his dream of pet ownership.  However, his dinosaur puppy proves difficult to manage and he must seek assistance from Uniqua the pet store owner, Pablo the police officer, and Tyrone the fireman.  This episode contains a priceless scene in which the kids dance atop a firetruck, a scene that is reminiscent of a Village People video.  My husband and I were in stitches.

As always, the episodes are gentle and contain many examples of the kids resolving their differences in a peaceful and constructive manner.  I love how polite they are and how this show teaches kids good morals without being at all preachy about it.  This is yet another Backyardigans gem that has left me eager for more.",1216166400,19,2428,4.861313868613139

3153769,5,B001675ZJC,"The Backyardigans series continues to amaze and amuse with imaginative stories and increasingly offbeat choices of music genre.  As usual, this DVD contains four episodes (these are from Season Three) as well as a few extra music videos.

""Match on Mount Olympus"" takes a basketball game to new heights as two guys from Ancient Greece (Tyrone and Pablo) join with the Gods and Goddesses in a pick-up game to determine the weather.  Four songs to a Samba beat set the mood for play.

""The Great Dolphin Race"" takes place underwater in ""Atlantis City"", with Tyrone owning a stable for racing dolphins, run by Pablo and Uniqua.  Uniqua finds a small but speedy dolphin that she wants to race, but first she has to convince Tyrone that he's up to speed.  This ""National Velvet""-type story is set to the beat of Columbian folk music.

""Ranch Hands from Outer Space"" is the first episode that doesn't feature Tyrone. Tasha has too much work on her hands to fix up her ranch, but helpful aliens Zablo and Zuniqua from Zorbidor show up in need of a little help themselves.  Many hands make work an out-of-this-world experience in this funny adventure set to Italian music.

""Caveman's Best Friend"" is a Stone Age romp set to some super soul music.  Austin buys a dinosaur pup from Uniqua and then unwittingly unleashes an epic chase involving Pablo the policeman and Tyrone the fireman.

Another solid DVD, warming us up for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-from-Fairytale-Village/dp/B001BN4WFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape from Fairytale Village</a>&nbsp;due in October 2008.

This is my all time favorite episode of the Backyardigans.  How could you not love songs like ""Horses on Our Heads""?? (LOL)  My granddaughter's love of this program has brought a lot of fun and enjoyment to my life and I admire the people who have created the Backyardigans... great talents to take obscure bits of music and turn it into something funny and also instructive, not just for the children but for us adults too!  Thank YOU!",1473984000,,615,4.513513513513513
