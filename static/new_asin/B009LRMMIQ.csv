They may not be award winning productions most times, but they usually have a decent storyline and decent acting. Have a Little Faith, in my opinion, is the exception.  Okay - I'm a sucker for true stories AND I'm old - so I enjoy good pieces by actors that have been around a while - like Laurence Fishburne and Martin Landau.  Beyond that, it's just a great true story by Mitch Albom, who has written Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven - great books in their own right.

This is a ""triple feature"" including Smile as Big as the Moon and Firelight in additions to Have a Little Faith.

I recommend this for simple family entertainment.",1355961600,,771,4.439716312056738
