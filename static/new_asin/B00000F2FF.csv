8171894,1,B00000F2FF,"Anglo-Paraguyan doctor Eduardo Plarr (Gere) moves into Corrientes, meets the honorary British Consul, Charlie Fortnum (Caine), an incorrigable drunk. Fortnum and the local chief of police, Colonel Perez (Hoskins), introduce him to the realities of life in the border town, which is under military occupation due to the high incidence of Paraguayan terrorism in the area. Eduardo starts having a passionless affair with Fortnum's 19 year old ex-prostitute wife  and gets involved with terrorists who kidnap Charlie instead of the American Ambassador. It ends badly.
Despite the excellent cast, the performances in this film are disappointing across the board: Gere's trying to hard, Caine's trying only as hard as he has to and the usually reliable Hoskins has a worse Spanish accent than Gere's English one. The characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic and Mackenzie directs at a snail's pace, which adds to the general feeling that nothing interesting is happening.",1032134400,5,974,5.493333333333333
