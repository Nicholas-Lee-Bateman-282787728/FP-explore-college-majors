3049657,5,B0010S6ERO,This DVD has some of the bloodiest matches in ROH history. It really shows you that ROH can be just as brutal the old ECW.,1209686400,,122,3.92
3049658,5,B0010S6ERO,"Ring of Honor, while known for some of the best technical and scientific matches in the U.S., also has a darker side.

Because the wrestlers in ROH have such a passion to win, many a rivalry has culminated in bloodshed, and here are some of bloodiest, most violent matches in Ring of Honor history.

The DVD kicks off a now-legendary cage match that saw Jay Briscoe try to wrest the ROH World Title from Samoa Joe. By the end of the match, Jay Briscoe was bleeding so heavily, the blood was literally oozing out of his head and coagulating before it hit the mat!

In another match on the card, CM Punk and Jimmy Rave took their feud to new levels of bloodshed in a dog collar match that saw Punk nearly collapse from blood loss!

A third match saw Team ROH, consisting of Samoa Joe, Adam Pearce, and BJ Whitmer, take on the invading marauders from rival promotion Combat Zone Wrestling, who brought a team that featured Chris Hero, Super Dragon, and the infamous Necro Butcher. The six men fought all over the building, using anything they could find as weapons, and as a result, the carnage and chaos levels were off the charts!

Other violent matches on this card include:
***The Second City Saints (CM Punk and Ace Steel) vs. the Prophecy (Dan Maff and BJ Whitmer) in a Chicago Street Fight.
***Generation Next (Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans, and Matt Sydal) vs. The Embassy (Jimmy Rave, Alex Shelley, Abyss, and Prince Nana) in a steel cage.
***Colt Cabana vs. Homicide in a Ghetto Street Fight.
***Colt Cabana vs. Jimmy Jacobs in a Windy City Death Match.
***Kevin Steen and El Generico vs. Jay and Mark Briscoe in Boston Street Fight.

Many of ROH's legendary, and bloodiest moments are included on this DVD, a can't miss title for any fan of wrestling who loves seeing the blood, sweat, and tears of of their favorite sport!

Add to the fact that this release features a limited edition trading card, as well as new commentary for some matches, it's a title that has to be owned by every wrestling fan!

8238229,5,B0010S6ERO,"For those who don't already know, Ring Of Honor (ROH) has been around since 2002 & has been called by many as the top independent promotion in the world based off the labeling of being an ""entertaining sport"" than ""sports entertainment"" due to a heavy focus on the aspect of in-ring professional wrestling resulting in the development of stars who have gone to be become top talents & even World Champions in other major organizations including C.M. Punk, Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan), Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, and Austin Aries just to name a few.  ROH released a series of DVD's a few years ago showcasing their matches & this one in particular focuses on the most violent & bloodiest encounters in the company's history hosted by Lenny Leonard & Dave Prazak.

Steel Cage Match: ROH Champion Samoa Joe vs. Jay Briscoe - Jay's brother Mark was on the outside as Jay kept trying to escape the cage early leaving an opening for Joe to punish him using the cage until he was so bloody to the point where Joe wore the blood on him as if it was war paint as both men fought back & forth with Jay at times resorting to desperate tactics along with moves himself such as a top rope ace crusher or Jay driller while Joe kept fighting with intensity including an ole kick with such impact that it broke the cage.  This was match where on top of the fight itself told a good story with both men showcasing that they had different strategies when it came to trying to win the match.
""At Our Best"" Mar. '04

Chicago Street Fight Match: Second City Saints (C.M. Punk & Ace Steel) vs. The Prophecy (Dan Maff & B.J. Whitmer) - The Saints had the hometown advantage here while both teams came dressed as you are with Prophecy attempting to stall on the outside only for the fight to get taken to them there with both teams brawling & bodies being thrown into the guardrail before both teams attempted the same strategy of ""divide & conquer"" working over one man in the ring & keeping the other out with more weapons being brought into play from chairs to a belt to a ladder to tables to barbed wire bats & boards being used in some very violent ways that not only resulted in the participants being busted open but all four men knocked out at one point & a classic moment from ""extreme"" past being revisited.  This was an extreme brawl from start to finish.
""Death Before Dishonor II"" July '04

Dog Collar Match: C.M. Punk vs. Jimmy Rave - Rave started off attacking from behind only for Punk to quickly come back with various stomps as the chain was first utilized pulling the other into the ring post & guardrails followed by the chain itself used as a weapon across the eyes & in the mouth & even used as a low blow along with it used to make moves more impactful such as a powerbomb before a chair was brought into play as well.  This type of match limits the competitors on what they could do but I'll give credit here in that I've saw the chain used in ways that I've never seen before in this match.
""Manhattan Mayhem"""" May '05

Steel Cage Warfare Match - Generation Next vs. The Embassy: Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans, Matt Sydal vs. Jimmy Rave, Alex Shelley, Abyss, Prince Nana) - This is ROH's version of the classic War Games match under elimination rules as a new participant enters every 5 minutes with the match ending when all of one team has been eliminated & featured such highlights as not just brawling in the ring but outside as well, various double team submissions, wrestlers not just tossed but launched into the cage, Abyss delivering a 3 revolution Black Hole Slam, a backwards double moonsault off the top of the cage...to the outside only to be topped by another double springboard backflip off the cage, multiple men bleeding, a chair involved in the match, and Prince Nana playing the classic ""J.J. Dillion"" role.  This did come off as a war with more than one ""OH MY GOD!"" moment.
""Steel Cage Warfare"" Dec. '05

Ghetto Street Fight/""I Quit"" Match: Colt Cabana vs. Homicide - The issues between Cabana & Homicide brought out a completely different side of Colt which we saw right from the start as he beat up Homicide from the backstage area into the ring causing Homicide to get violent using the environment around ringside to his advantage along with various weapons like a chair & razor blade & coat hanger while trying to rip out his tongue only for Colt to get more aggressive injuring Homicide's arm choking him with it & biting it resulting in Homicide & his allies to just get more & more violent to the point where the line was crossed & someone just couldn't take it anymore.  This match was aggressive to say the least as we saw a very devilish side of Homicide along with a more aggressive side of Colt Cabana himself.
""4th Anniversary Show"" Feb. '07

Anything Goes Match: Team Ring Of Honor vs. Team Combat Zone Wrestling: Samoa Joe, Adam Pearce, B.J. Whitmer vs. Chris Hero, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher - It should be noted that this match had referees from both ROH & CZW along with the announcers running away for their own safety as this started out as a brawl & didn't let up with the fight happening in & outside of the ring with aggressive offense such as an ole kick that knocked a guy over the barricade to various weapons used from chairs to tables for killer chairshots & men being put through them from all different parts of the ring to the point where the wrestlers were bleeding, the announcers ran away for their own safety, and referees & owners of the promotions getting physically involved.  This wasn't a brawl or a fight, this was a riot!
""100th Show"" Apr. '06

Windy City Death Match: Colt Cabana vs. Jimmy Jacobs - Jacobs attempted to avoid Cabana early & even use Lacey as a distraction before Colt got some help to make this one on one as both men showed their violent side with Colt using Jimmy's own weapons against him while Jacobs took advantage of his surroundings along with getting his hands back on some of his own weapons resulting in both men bleeding as they continued to attempt to take the other out with either a hammer to the head or a flag pole in the eye along with associates of both men attempting to make a difference as it just got more violent with bodies going through tables & a ladder coming into play.  This was a very wild & violent match where both men came off as they were more concentrated on eliminating the other man more than just winning the match.
""5th Year Festival"" Feb. '07

Boston Street Fight Match: Kevin Steen & El Generico vs. Briscoe Brothers - It should be noted that there were no commentators at ringside for this match as it started off wild with fighting in the crowd & around ringside with chairs & tables being launched not just into the ring but as the competitors with even the superstars sacrificing themselves to take the others out like coming off the top rope into the crowd with more weapons being used in the brawl such as the guardrail & a trash can to the point where they were physically beating on each other on the outside for close to 10 minutes.  The fight eventually made it's way back to the ring where blood was spilled then worn as war paint & the chairs were used more violently including a standoff between all four men & one man launched into the air only to land on two open chairs & a brainbuster onto an open chair only for things to get turned up even more when a ladder was put into the ring.  This was a non-stop physical fight.
""Death Before Dishonor V"" Apr. '07

I can't disagree that there were some of the most physical & violent out of control matches I've seen coming from not just those known for being ""hardcore"" but also those who doesn't have that reputation of going to such ""extreme"" so if you like wild brawling & crazy fights then add this to your collection.",1383350400,,7818,4.46218487394958
8238230,4,B0010S6ERO,"Ring Of Honor is known for the best technical wrestling on the planet but from time to time, it was known for some of the most bloody action anywhere! Here is a sample of that:

Samoa Joe vs. Jay Briscoe (ROH World Title in a cage) - While best known for his tag team exploits with his brother Mark, Jay Briscoe has had good runs as a singles wrestler and has come close to winning the ROH singles title himself! Here, he takes on Samoa Joe in a cage match where Joe can only win by pinfall or submission while Jay can win by those means as well as escape the cage! I would call this one a MUST VIEW!

In this one, Jay is split open like a pig and takes a tremendous beating at the hands of Joe. We also see a run-in by A.J. Styles on Mark Briscoe. Ends with an awesome ""Muscle Buster"" from the top rope! Joe retains his title!

The Second City Saints (CM Punk & Ace Steel) vs. The Prophecy (Dan Maff & BJ Whitmer) - This tag team match was a Chicago Street Fight. While not that bloody, it does get violent and has some sick spots! Ends when Ace Steel executes a tombstone piledriver on B.J. Whitmer......through a table! Good match though not really a must view!

CM Punk vs. Jimmy Rave (Dog Collar Chain Match) - This was a brutal affair that saw outside interference from The Embassy! Ends when Rave hits two sick chair shots on an already battered Punk for the win.

Generation Next (Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans, Matt Sydal) vs. The Embassy (Jimmy Rave, Alex Shelley, Abyss, Prince Nana) - The rules of this cage match were a combination of WCW's WarGames and WWE's Royal Rumble in that it starts with two people and it alternates between teams until all the men have came out. Eliminations can happen at any point during the match and people can fight outside the cage as well as inside but the pinfalls or submissions must take place inside the ring!

This was a bloody affair that saw not only issues between the two factions but a personal issue between Roderick Strong and Jimmy Rave as Rave attacked Jade Chung (who had left The Embassy and became Roderick's on-screen girlfriend). The only disadvantage had to be for Generation Next because of Abyss (who was 6'6"" and weighed 360lbs.) but that didn't stop them. Several high impact moves and high spots (especially from Jack Evans)! Ends with Generation Next getting the duke and getting revenge on The Embassy! This one is a MUST VIEW!

Colt Cabana vs. Homicide (Ghetto Street Fight) - In this one, the loser is the one that submits to his opponent so basically this was an ""I Quit"" match! While I like Colt Cabana, this was not one of his better matches as this was just a way to continue their feud! Homicide pretty much dominates and wins this one even though the ref is the one that stopped it as Cabana never actually quit.

Team ROH (Samoa Joe, Adam Pearce, BJ Whitmer) vs. Team CZW (Chris Hero, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher) - Pure mayhem! This was an old school ECW style brawl here! Best spot was Super Dragon's version of the burning hammer on one of the ROH guys (I think BJ Whitmer) through a table! We also see a heel turn from Claudio Castanogli as he sided with Team CZW! CZW wins this one of several matches between the two organizations. I would give this one a MUST VIEW vote!

Colt Cabana vs. Jimmy Jacobs - I barely remember this match! ROH doesn't put on many duds but this was one! Sad because both Colt Cabana and Jimmy Jacobs are good performers! View once and skip!

Kevin Steen & El Generico vs. Jay & Mark Briscoe (Boston Street Fight) - OMG! This is a MUST VIEW on this release! Blood, wrestling, fighting....this one's got it! No words I can use will do this one justice! See this one!

Overall, not a bad release!",1306454400,,3719,4.390988372093023
8238231,5,B0010S6ERO,"Just as good as any ECW dvd I ever saw. All the matches are very hardcore & live up to the DVD's name but the matches that stick out the most are the CM Punk-Jimmy Rave-Dog Collar match which was just as hardcore as the Greg Valentine-Roddy Piper-Dog Collar match from Starrcade 1983,The Wargames match between Generation Next & The Embassy which was a great reminder of NWA's Wargames back in the 1980's & the 6 man tag team war between Team ROH & Team CZW which was just as bloody & hard-hitting as Celebrity Deathmatch. The rest were just as hardcore. I give this dvd a 10 out of 10.",1280102400,3,586,4.288288288288288

Seeing Samoa Joe and CM Punk prior to joining the TNA/WWE shows how much they had to go through to get to the big promotions. Of the rest of the wrestlers are no slouch either, but if you want to see wrestlers that are trying to make it big by performing before a few hundred or a few thousand people, slamming, beating, flying, bleeding, chair throwing and just plain entertaining without the ""glare"" of sparkling lights, this is the promotion to watch.",1212796800,,532,4.438775510204081
