8546040,1,B00A1AU62G,As long as Fox continues to release their old Cinemascope films (original ratio: 2:35 to 1) in these shoddy made-on-demand dvd-r's in full frame (1:33 ratio)...I will continue to rate them at *1* star.  Don't support these crappy releases! Boycott them!!,1436572800,,254,5.195121951219512
8546041,5,B00A1AU62G,"In 1962 It Happened In Athens was released. Jayne Mansfield's contract was up at Fox. A  flm, at least a little different from her usual roles. Jayne fans love her in anything.",1395446400,,176,4.5

8546043,1,B00A1AU62G,"great, fun, thrilling, dramatic & exciting movies released in a format that doesn't enhance your viewing pleasure. the studios......go figure.....why do they do the viewing audience such a disfavor?  5 stars for movie & 0 stars for dvd",1379203200,7,235,5.184210526315789
8546044,3,B00A1AU62G,"In the fall of 1960, Jayne Mansfield went back to 20th Century-Fox after a 2-year hiatus from them, where in which she worked in England. Fox was going bankrupt at the time due to costly delays on the epic production of ""Cleopatra"" (1963), starring Elizabeth Taylor. Fox hoped a movie starring Jayne would recoup their recent investments. To that end they cast her in ""It Happened in Athens"", a comedy film about the first Olympic Games in 1896. It was shot on location in Greece. Though thought to be a low-budget film, it was actually given a high budget, as well as being shot in Cinemascope and Deluxe color.

To clear up any questions: Jayne Mansfield is NOT the star of this movie. Though she is top-billed and appears in all the publicity shots (if you were to look them up on Google Images.com), she appears rather briefly as fictional stage star Eleni Costa. Newcomer Trax Colton stars in this downbeat comedic farce as Spiridon Loues, a young boy eager to enter the Olympic Games as a runner.

The movie was not released until June 1962, and was a critical and box office failure. It is frankly one of Jayne's worst attempts at a comedy. I would much rather you check out her comedic skills in ""The Girl Can't Help It"" (1956) or ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" (1957), or her dramatic turn in ""The Wayward Bus"" (1957) and ""Too Hot to Handle"" (1960). By all means avoid ""Promises! Promises!"" (1963) unless you just want to see her boobies, as well as all her films from 1964 onward, unless you want to see her for a minute or so.

I would give this movie 3 out of 5 stars, because of its dragged story and for its corny humor and mild use of Jayne. Not your typical Jayne Mansfield movie. Thanks, I hope I was helpful.",1366848000,4,1729,4.465189873417722
8546045,1,B00A1AU62G,"Congratulations Rupert Murdock, You've Conned me again. The number of these pan & scan t.v. prints of Fox's cinema archive series now confirm you as 'KING of CRAPP' across all media. The cinemascope & color by deluxe are even displayed on the cover art....SHAME!",1362787200,7,262,4.9772727272727275
8546046,4,B00A1AU62G,It is very rare to find some original films staring Jayne Mansfield. Seller serious. Thank you. I talk of you to my friends.,1360281600,,124,4.434782608695652
8546047,3,B00A1AU62G,"As JM's all time #1 fan, I was very much looking forward to receiving this dvd in the mail and ready to throw out my old dvd bootleg copy of it. However, after viewing the film from the 20th Century Fox Cinema Archives dvd collection, I think I'll hang on to it. Not much of an improvement, if any, from my bootleg.  Here's why: The picture is VERY grainy on a high definition television screen, even for a manufactured on demand dvd with no remastering. And the picture ratio is standard TV size (Formatted to fit, this screen, the intro says), and NOT the original widescreen/Cinemascope in which it was filmed and originally presented. Not what I was hoping for. The C-Scope would have made the cinematography look a lot more appealing and 20th Century Fox should know better that to release a cropped product like this in the digital age. If this were a Monroe film, I'm sure it would have gotten a much better home video representation.  Maybe someday.... On the plus side: Jayne looks beautiful as usual, and the ""color by DeLux"" is very vibrant. For example, through the grain you can see the pale brown of Jayne's gorgeous eyes, and even a touch of cellulite on her thighs, which to me makes her even more beautiful and human. As for the movie itself, Jayne's screen time is very limited and it's not the greatest film ever made, but fun for Jayne watchers and collectors.",1355097600,14,1380,4.560483870967742
