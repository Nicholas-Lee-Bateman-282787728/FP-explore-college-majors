But if you're interested in the history of the  Hong Kong action cinema scene, it's an unintentionally hilarious gem.  First some background. This film star's Jimmy Wang Yu who became a Hong  Kong hit with ""One-Armed Swordsman"" and ""The Chinese  Boxer"" years before Bruce Lee.  It's directed by Lo Wei who helmed  Lee's first two movies ""Fists of Fury"" and ""The Chinese  Connection"".  ""Man Called Tiger"" supposedly was going to be  Lee's third film with Lo Wei.  But Lee, who called Lo Wei "" a raving  egomaniac"" got into violent confrontation with the director  immediately after ""Chinese Connection"" wrapped. Afterwards Lo Wei  insist he alone was responsible for the success of Lee's first two movies.  Jimmy Wang Yu was a water polo star who made dozens of chop sockey  thrillers despite the obvious fact that he had no martial arts ability.  Despite that, many in Hong Kong had him pegged as the ""new Bruce  Lee"". As a side not, Wang Yu has called on Jackie Chan several times  to pay back ""favors"" by appearing in his films, the latest being  ""Island of Fire"". As for the film itself, it's real hoot.  You  might as well hit the mute button unless you speak Catonese or are really  into 1970's Chinese pop music.  The subtitles are absolutely mangled.  The  fighting, if you take it seriously, is real bad.  Wang Yu kicks with his  knee bent, and looks about as graceful as tap dancing buffalo.  Lo Wei adds  endless trapoline jumps that make Wang Yu look like he's got pogo sticks  for legs.  The director also gives himself an important cameo at the end as  an ace gambler/undercover cop.  But the film does have boundless energy.  Wang Yu keeps on kicking butt throughout the picture even if he looks  ridiculous doing doing it.  And it culminates in a wild battle royal  featuring Wang Yu and a very unlucky friend versus a whole room full of axe  wielding hitmen.  During that fight Wang Yu does, quite literally, his  impersonation of a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest.  That sequence  alone is worth a look.",966902400,3,2123,4.667574931880109
