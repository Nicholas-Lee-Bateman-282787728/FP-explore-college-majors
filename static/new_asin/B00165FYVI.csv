8260977,4,B00165FYVI,Good video but I would have liked a little more time between moves for students to follow.  My son uses this to practice his forms for competition.,1225584000,,147,4.444444444444445
8260978,5,B00165FYVI,My son uses this DVD to complement his classroom TKD instruction.  It has helped him prepare for every belt test he's had so far.  Master Hong is an excellent instructor--I highly recommend it.,1220313600,,193,4.818181818181818
