4983505,5,B006CEWGLO,"I absolutely loved this short lived series. I wish they could have kept this going but sadly it looks like this all we're going to get. I would say my favorite episode on this series would have to be episode 2. Love the sci-fi convention scene and especially the whack job scene starring none other than Johnny Depp. ""Wanna go to the toilet with me?"" Mr. depp asks and cut to Warwick standing literally in the toilet and Johnny saying, ""Toilet troll love it!"" That scene had me bawling to be honest. Among other great episodes there are other funtastic viewings of other celebs inluding Helena Bonham Carter, Cat Deeley, and Sting. I definitely recommend this series if you were ever a fan of Warwick Davis.",1359072000,,707,4.619047619047619
4983506,2,B006CEWGLO,"I'm a fan of Ricky Gervais's other work, both versions of The Office, and the Extras, and even An Idiot Abroad are some of my favorite comedy material--right up there with Monty Python and Office Space.

But this show just falls flat.  It feels like all the same old tricks, this time with Warrick Davis at the butt of the jokes.

Real-life celebrity cameos?  Check.  Did that in Extras--and much better.

Self-deprecating humor?  Check.  Did that in The Office and in Extras.

I'm sure some people will find this series riveting. I find it dry and dull.  Perhaps if I didn't already know all of Gervais's tricks, I would enjoy this show more.

I ordered HBO to watch this when it first began airing.  After the fourth episode, I canceled my HBO subscription.

Please don't buy this unless you have already seen at least one or two episodes, and know you will enjoy it.  I suggest previewing via one of the popular streaming or DVD-by-mail services, first.",1357084800,7,956,4.6467065868263475
4983507,5,B006CEWGLO,"This short (no pun intended) series focuses around Warwick Davis (Willow, The Leprechaun, Return Of The Jedi) and Ricky Gervais (Stardust, Extras) as fictionalized versions of themselves and mainly the struggle of being a little person in the world of cinema. This series is light hearted and yet meaningful in regards to what it's like to work in main stream film making as a little person and trying to break out of the typical type cast roles. This BBC series has great cameos by Liam Neeson, Johnny Depp, Sting and many more. If you've ever seen any other Ricky Gervais shows (like Extras)  then you'll know what to expect with the style of writing and comedy in this series. It is funny, cringe-worthy and smart. Received fairy negatively because of its social fuax pas and unpleasant scenarios, I think this show is just not understood by most audiences. This isn't supposed to be some message riddled show about the life of a little person, but more of a fictionalized stereotypical look at how little people are often treated in society and mainstream film making as well as stereotypical Hollywood actors being egotistical and vapid. While there are some messages and subtexts to be had in this 7 episode run, mainly it is meant to entertain, evoke cringing and laughs and broaden ones horizons which I felt it did an exceptional job of.

I will update my review on the Blu-Ray transfer when it becomes available.",1353283200,8,1422,4.8
4983508,5,B006CEWGLO,"i love this show because of warwick davis , although ricky gervais is in every episode and i can only tolerate him in small doses, (he can be alittle obnoxnious ).it is a good show , it is a very funny show ,the actress that plays his assistant is also funny. i cant wait for season 2,so please give this show a chance , especially if you like britcoms.",1340064000,5,353,4.130434782608695

4983520,5,B006CEWGLO,"Disclaimer:  I love Ricky Gervais' humor. (Although for some reason, I wasn't as fond of ""Extras""). I watch ""Life's Too Short"" over again for the nuances. Warwick Davis looking into the camera is priceless.  If you're the person (as I often am) that tries to multitask and listen for the dialogue you'll miss the best parts here.  Ricky knows how to do it.  The watcher becomes the camera man just bursting inside with unbelievable glee at the moments he/she caught on camera. Ricky is a master; he gives us just enough of Warwick's life to want more.",1397692800,3,551,4.649484536082475
4983521,5,B006CEWGLO,"This is so funny!  For someone so small, he acts big. Never gives up, full of ideas. Really enjoyed watching this & would recommend it to anyone. Very good actor!",1396224000,,162,4.4
4983522,5,B006CEWGLO,"This show is just plain funny. This show proves that Warwick Davis is a phenomenal comic actor. He does the double takes, delivers the straight lines, has great reaction shots, but is perhaps best in physical comedy. If you enjoy dry comedy or slapstick, it is absolutely worth the money to buy this DVD (actually 2 DVDs). The cameos by Liam Neeson and Johnny Depp are, if anything, rather tedious compared to Warwick Davis' brilliant acting. Don't hesitate to take a chance on this. I look forward to watching it again and again.",1386720000,6,530,4.709677419354839
4983523,3,B006CEWGLO,"Funny series, especially for Star Wars fans.  Warwick Davis did a great job.  However, the series was uncomfortably between a reality show and an actual movie.  I thought Extras was much better.",1375488000,,194,5.0

4983525,5,B006CEWGLO,"Just fantastic. Sorry America, but the English are far better in the humour area than you.
This is sooo funny, and almost difficult to watch sometimes. You forget it is only a video.",1370649600,2,182,4.545454545454546

4983527,5,B006CEWGLO,"This is a most excellent addition to the work of Ricky Gervais.  Warwick does an amazing job and when he makes fun of the cripple boy, that's the best!  There needs to be more of that in today's TV.  The cameo's were great.",1369958400,,223,4.1395348837209305
4983528,5,B006CEWGLO,I love this show. It has one of my favorite actors Warwick Davis. I think this show is going be hilarious.,1369872000,,106,4.095238095238095
4983529,4,B006CEWGLO,"Part of what makes this show so amusing and funny is the fact that Warwick Davis is very egotistical, but extremely awkward and basically failing at life in this series. Asking for money, lying to people to make himself look good (and then they find out the truth), etc. As a huge follower of Ricky Gervais, this is basically almost any character Ricky Gervais has ever done. This is a mixture of David Brent and Andy Millman. That being said, I'm not bored of it, it's just that I can tell Ricky had involvement in this project, which is good. It's charming and I'm glad I purchased it.",1368403200,,587,4.444444444444445
4983530,5,B006CEWGLO,"you either get this show or you don't, but i loved every episode and have watched it several times, brilliant work by Warwick Davis and the guest appearance spots are just plain funny!! I hope we get  more of this show, it was one of my favorites and is still on my DVR.",1367366400,,270,4.09433962264151
4983531,2,B006CEWGLO,not as funny as i expected. Thought it would be as funny as idiot abroad or the office. no. hopefully i can resell it,1364947200,,117,3.9166666666666665
4983532,5,B006CEWGLO,A hilarious show.  Great physical comedy from Warwick.  Just wish there was more of it.  Maybe there will be a resurrection sometime in the future.,1364515200,,147,4.8
4983533,5,B006CEWGLO,"See life from the shorter side in this great production from Ricky Gervais. Guest starring actors such as Liam Neeson and Sting, who aren't normally funny at all!",1363305600,,162,4.821428571428571
4983534,5,B006CEWGLO,"It's a shame that not too many of us American's appreciated this show. Let me start off by saying ""Good going, Warwick!"". Warwick has been one of my favorite actors since I saw him in Willow. When you see the body of work he's done (no pun intended), you'll see how versatile he is. From the sweet and caring Willow to the funny character he plays on this show to the Harry potter characters to the evil and vile Leprechaun, he can do ANYTHING. It's nice to see him get a gig where people see his face and see him talk about his life and films, even if it is all in jest. Give this show a chance, it's totally unique. The only thing better than getting these DVD's today is knowing the Willow Bluray will be out in less than a month!",1361404800,2,733,4.1328671328671325
4983535,5,B006CEWGLO,"The only bad thing about this series is it only has seven episodes.  If you like Ricky Gervais and his type of humor, you'll like this fictional account of Warrick Davis's life as a little person actor.  The cameos are hysterical and amazing considering how famouse these people are.  It's cleverly written and has a cast of supporting characters who are all well done.  I recommend it for an afternoon of laughs.  There are no plans to continue the series at this time and that's a shame, becuase it is hysterical.

If you don't like the British version of the Office or Extras, etc. Don't watch this, it isn't for you.  If you do like those shows, jump on this one, it's right up there.",1360627200,10,688,4.456
4983536,5,B006CEWGLO,"some absolutely hilarious scenes, especially the ones with liam neeson and johnny depp......
sorry it's one and done for this show....",1360627200,4,134,5.428571428571429
4983537,5,B006CEWGLO,"So funny. If you like Ricky Gervais, this is probably one of the funniest things he has done without that bitter-sweet edge that most of his shows have. Love it!",1360281600,,161,4.4
4983538,5,B006CEWGLO,I absolutely love Warwick with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant!  This first season was as funny and painful as the BBC Office series.  Warwick is just as self serving and embarrassing as Ricky was in the Office.  There are many jokes that will make you cringe...that is the best!  Crude and obnoxious!  I absolutely loved it!  Hilarious!,1359936000,2,340,4.87719298245614
8496451,5,B006CEWGLO,"So funny. And Warwick is such a warm, funny and intelligent person. Obviously the interactions with celebrities and Ricky were a bit contrived, but for comedic effect. It always surprises me how Ricky can persuade famous people to make themselves look bad in this and in Extras.",1529539200,,278,4.9361702127659575
8496452,5,B006CEWGLO,"This series is a Ricky Gervais/Stephen Merchant production and is hilarious. It follows the same theme as, EXTRAS, which Gervais played so, so well, along with Merchant. These two men are just incredible writers. You have to remember that this is a mockumentary and not take it to heart. If you may be easily offended at certain things, you should avoid this series. The star of it is making fun of himself.",1523404800,,407,4.666666666666667

8496455,5,B006CEWGLO,Great show,1493164800,,10,4.5
8496456,2,B006CEWGLO,"Ok, so Gervais had success with Extras, having celebrities come on and act like jerks.  So, why not have a celebrity be the star of the series and watch him act like a jerk, too?  Unfortunately, who knows what Warwick Davis is really like in person?  Maybe he is really a jerk.  I don't know.  So, the whole premise is bad.  The shows drag on and on, with the only comic interludes being the regular appearances of Gervais and Stephen Merchant, and they recycle the same joke over and over (Gervais passing the buck over to Merchant).  I would buy the series just to see the outtakes, but you can probably watch those for free on youtube.  There are no surprises, no great, memorable moments (like the David Bowie song in Extras), no memorable characters (like David Brent in The Office).  Move along, nothing to see here.",1484352000,,822,4.537414965986395
8496457,5,B006CEWGLO,I watched the original series when it came out and found it hilarious then . It is a pity that they could not get another season out of it.,1471392000,,139,3.8275862068965516
8496458,5,B006CEWGLO,I am sad that it lasted only one season...the world needs more laughter and this is a great way to get it!,1469836800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8496459,5,B006CEWGLO,"I'm now a total fan of Warwick Davis. He's very funny, and a great actor. And although this show makes fun of the usual for a Ricky Gervais show (jerk who has likeable qualities who always ends up putting his foot in his mouth) there are quite a few jokes that ALSO draw upon the simple fact that Warwick is a little person. But other than that, I do appreciate Gervais' & Merchant's humor, and Warwick is the most likeable ""jerk"" of all their shows. My favorite cameos were Johnny Depp's and Liam Nissan's (make sure to watch the Bonus Material for the great stuff that got cut out from these scenes!) but, Warwick steals the show. I'm a new fan and hope to see more of him.",1459123200,,675,4.28125
