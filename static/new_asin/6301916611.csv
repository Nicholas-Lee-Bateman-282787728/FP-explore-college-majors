7816569,1,6301916611,"Really weird video.  I am an intermediate exerciser and was really looking forward to this based on the reviews but was very disappointed.  Lots of very strange facial movements, boring music and virtually no benefits.",1286496000,,218,5.2

7816571,5,6301916611,"In the past 6 years, I have completely changed my lifestyle, lost 62lbs and kept it off!  Synergetics was a big part of my fitness plan.  I use the tape several times a week and have read the book.  Synergetics is an exercise plan that is easy to stick with because there is no strain or struggle. It can be easily altered in intensity or changed to accomodate a disability or special need.  This is a major consideration in choosing a plan to stick with.  If I am tired, I can do the exercises gently and easily and find them very relaxing.  If I have a lot of energy, I add a 3-5 lb weight and do them with more energy.  This is a very effective plan, and I am glad to see it still available.  I would love to see it re-vamped and re-marketed.  It's time has finally arrived!",1017792000,4,777,4.126666666666667

Taylor and Joanna - keep up the good work and spread the word about the Synergetics exercises.",972691200,3,320,4.482758620689655
