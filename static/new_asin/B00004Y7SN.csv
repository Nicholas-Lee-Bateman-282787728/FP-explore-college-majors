1372839,5,B00004Y7SN,"I was so envious of the ""Good"" dancers.......... I was not sure how they did it or if I ever could. Chris and Julee have given me the understanding to feel the music, enjoy myself, and most importantly let my partner enjoy our dance together. Watching ""Good"" dancers is sometimes intimidating. There is something about watching Chris that gives me the confidence to believe that I too can do what is being shown. Julee gives me the understanding of what a follow looks for. I am sure they do the same for the Follows.  They both exhude the fun that swing is all about. Some of the moves I learned from the tape, I used the very first time out. They worked, and the feedback about ""MY"" new moves was positive. Thanks,guys........Will there be an advanced video soon?",970012800,5,765,4.543478260869565

7926963,4,B00004Y7SN,"Has about 7 moves . Could of used 5 more instead of recapping basic steps ..Good instruction . would of got 5 stars if it had more moves. They are easy moves ,I agree ,but that's what I was looking for. Something I could lead a new partner at a dance.",1388361600,,251,3.9411764705882355
7926964,1,B00004Y7SN,"The people dancing in this video has no style at all.  They are so wooden, especially the guy.  This is not intermediate swing at all.  This is more like basic swing.  There is nothing intermediate about any of these moves.  You basically learn total of six simple moves.  Horrible investment.",1234137600,,293,4.76
7926965,4,B00004Y7SN,We love Chris Yee. He is so smooth. The instruction is easy to follow and fun.  We learned many new moves from this dvd.,1204329600,,120,4.0
7926966,1,B00004Y7SN,"I was very disappointed after reading your positive reviews when I didn't see this at all after ordering and trying to learn the steps that your talking about, I wonder who wrote these reviews. Someone definitely knows a lot of words but not practice. I regret ever ordering this tape.",1175472000,,285,4.72
7926967,1,B00004Y7SN,This dvd is boring.  The instructors do not deliver the material in a way that makes you want to learn.,1155945600,2,103,4.15
7926968,5,B00004Y7SN,excellent video. Wishyou both will progress to more advanced moves and amalgamations. Thanks you jbcrespo,1140566400,2,105,6.066666666666666
7926969,5,B00004Y7SN,"The whole series (though Vol 3 is called ""Introduction to Lindy Hop"" compared to 1 and 2 which reference ""Swing"") is excellent.  We thought we had the fundamentals and even intermediate points of swing pretty well off - and we did - but we got a lot of ""fine tuning"" out of this series.  Some GREAT really clearly illustrated stuff on subtle hand signalling, great camera angles to illustrate what is going and good comentary will all improve your footwork, body position, leading and following.  We also got some new moves which on the East Coast USA were new to folks around here and expanded our repertoire.

If you are beginners - this series is probably the best illustrated and paced we have seen.  If you can't get an instructor locally then this is a good start and will get you putting on a great swing routine pretty quickly.

The series of DVD's really build on the previous ones - so take them in order, push back the furniture and dance with your DVD remote in your hand.  They really lend to track back and slow motion play if you want to see what is going on!",1123718400,7,1074,4.4213197969543145
7926970,4,B00004Y7SN,"What I liked best with this video is how they combined various moves from the first video and ones taught early on this one to make sequences.  This helps you practice transitions between patterns.  A little more about up-beat/down-beat and musicality in general would've earned this a 5-star rating, but otherwise a solid choice for the beginner/intermediate dancer.",1050192000,9,367,5.310344827586207
7926971,5,B00004Y7SN,"I have taken lessons, taught lessons, and watched many videos on swing dancing and this series is the best.  Intermediate 6-Count Swing introduces the triple step variation of the dance and adds many more moves to your list.  Chris and Julie are excellent dance instructers and use excellent methodology to teach beginners how to dance.  I would recommend viewing Beginning Lindy Hop (even if you already know a lot about swing dancing) befor using this one.",1004400000,13,458,5.0
