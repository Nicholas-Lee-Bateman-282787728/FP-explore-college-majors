8118662,1,B000F6ZE46,I first watch American colony : meet the Hutterites it was good but this was not. You can get more out American colony : meet the Hutterites on Amazon Instant Video.,1353888000,,165,4.354838709677419
8118663,5,B000F6ZE46,"After watching American colony : meet the Hutterites....  I immediately bought this looking for more details of their secret world and Ya I found some. Watching the documentary you see Nothing has changed in regard to life on the colony.. old traditions have not changed one bit.  the women still make their own soap, do kitchen work, garden work and feather plucking. The men are also very much the same. there hasn't been a lot progressing in the last fifty years, unless it had to do with farming. Also included is a section describing the children's life from birth, probably the most interesting part of this.

Five Stars!!!!",1341100800,,630,4.814814814814815
8118664,4,B000F6ZE46,"I agree with Susan, this is a dated film but a good introduction of the Hutterites. There are three sects of Hutterites, but this film talks mostly about the most liberal sect. I had deep respect for this group of Christians before I saw the film and it just confirmed my feelings for them. A word of caution, do not expect to be entertained. A high school photo class could have done a better job and the price is highway robbery, but there is so little information about the Hutterites, this film is worth viewing.

Cons: Amazon is selling this as a ""make as you order"" DVD. They are using Create Space to make the DVD's. My first order came in five days, but it did not work in any of my DVD players. I sent it back for a replacement, and the replacement took twice as long to get here. The second DVD did not work in any of my DVD players, but it did work in my new laptop, so we had to all gather around the laptop to see it. It has been another two weeks and my third replacement has not arrived yet. I will not deal with ""Create Space"" DVD's anymore. I also ordered eight other DVD movies, that were not Create Space, and all of them play fine in every one of my DVD players. I give the film a #4 rating and the new DVD technology a #0 rating. I love ordering from Amazon, I hope the issues with Create Space are resolved soon.",1263254400,,1334,4.111111111111111
8118665,4,B000F6ZE46,"The Hutterites are a small group of Christians practicing a communal life style. This DVD is an introduction to their way of life and as such is a rare treat. The DVD is a bit dated, but offers a fascinating introduction to the religious group.",1244332800,3,244,4.444444444444445
