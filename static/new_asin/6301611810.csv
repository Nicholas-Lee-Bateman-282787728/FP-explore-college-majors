342588,5,6301611810,"These are outstanding videos... I echo the other reviews... but there is an unexpected source of entertainment here.  I watch the episodes late at night, with the volume low and the English captions turned on.  I find myself distracted by the ludicrous differences between the spoken dialog and the captions!

There are two or three mistakes per minute, as if the transcriber could not hear well, was utterly unfamiliar with educated Victorian figures of speech, AND knew English only as a second language.  As a single instance, in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" Dr. Watson compliments Mrs. Hudson, saying (sound track) ""You are the heroine of the evening!""  The caption below says ""You are the heron of the evening.""  That's ""heron"" as in the long-legged waterfowl.

So, you see?  The transcriber was hard of heron.

There are many of these errors, often very funny. Turn on the captions and have fun.  ;-)",1094601600,20,912,4.901960784313726
342589,5,6301611810,"""The Return of Sherlock Holmes Collection"" continues the almost-perfect adaptation of Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes cannon.  Jeremy Brett returns as Holmes incarnate, slightly less exuberant due to his illness, but lacking none of the spark and charisma of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.""  Edward Hardwicke takes over as Watson so completely that David Burke is hardly missed.
All of the high-production values, including excellent location shootings and costumes and such, are carried over along with the cast.  Granada Television really put care into this series, and it shows.
There are some great episodes here, such as ""Silver Blaze"" with Holmes and Watson investigating a missing race horse, ""The Devil's Foot"" with Holmes battle against his own addiction as well as crime, the wonderful ""The Six Napoleons"" and the eerie ""The Musgrave Ritual.""  Actually, they  are all top-quality.
This series is the finest Sherlock Holmes adaptation, bar none, and the high quality contines in this set.",1089849600,48,1003,5.445161290322581
342590,5,6301611810,"What can I say about this DVD?  Holmes is brought back by Jeremy Brett.  There is a different Watson but you could hardly tell the difference from David Burke and Edward Hardwicke.  They both have their own version of Watson and do wonderfully in the part.  But Jeremy Brett once again shines as Sherlock Holmes.  I can never tire of watching these episodes or the previous ones.  I cannot wait till the Memoirs and the Casebook comes out on DVD.  We can further delve into the lives of Holmes and Watson as they set off to solve more mysterious.  You get to see the sensitive side of Holmes as Inspector Lestrade tells him that everyone down at the yard are proud of him.  You can almost see Holmes swallow the lump that formed in his throat.  Of course that might just be my imagination.  Whenever I watch these shows I get lost in the writing and acting.  Once again Holmes and Watson are being played by actors I enjoy and respect.  ""Come, Watson.  The game's afoot.""",1079395200,9,971,4.443181818181818
342591,5,6301611810,"What a great series this is!  The only disappointment is that there are few extras on the DVD.  Jeremy Brett continues (from the first boxed set and feature film boxed set) to be THE definitive - without a doubt - Sherlock Holmes.  His mannerisms, dress, deportment, movements provide a complete picture of how Doyle's Holmes should look.
This boxed set is a must have, especially for anyone who owns The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes boxed set.  There are several reasons for this in addition to Brett's great portrayal.
First, the Empty House is critical as a follow up to The Final Problem.  Any true Holmes' fan has to admit to at least a little depression following the last tale in the ""Adventures"" series (i.e., the Final Problem).  The Empty House returns Holmes in full glory and Holmes' story about the ""missing"" years is priceless.
Second, the series shows Brett at his best, before the illness he suffered from reduced his health.  Even in later series, Brett does a terrific job despite his health.  But he appears here as a vibrant Holmes, a natural continuation of his portrayal form ""Adventures.""
Third, Edward Hardwicke offers a different, more professional, version of Watson than did David Burke in the ""Adventures.""  Actually, Burke was great in the first series and ideal as a younger Watson.  In some respects that youthful exuberance is missed in the ""Return"" and it's a shame that Burke could not continue.  But Hardwicke's characterization allows Watson to approach Holmes as an equal of sorts (not that Watson could ever equal Holmes) in that professionalism that his demeanor naturally gives to Watson.
All in all a tremendous collection and as faithful to the stories as a television series could realistically be.",1075334400,17,1742,4.972413793103448
342592,4,6301611810,"The second MPI box set of the Granada Sherlock Holmes tv series is an improvement over the first set which collected The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes. Gone are the distorted soundtracks and video problems that were present on a few of the discs in that 5 disc set. The audio is fine on all of these discs. The video transfers are all somewhat soft and a little too dark in some episodes ('The Man With The Twisted Lip' and 'The Bruce Partington Plans' both have segments which are so dark that it's difficult to make out what is happening onscreen, for example) but there is none of the picture ""wobbling"" or excessive grain that was present in the previous set. It's good to see MPI using a dual layer presentation on disc 4 which contains 3 episodes. With the first set, a 2 sided disc was used to present 4 episodes (2 per single layer side) and one single layer disc had 3 episodes compressed onto it which compromised the audio and visual quality. Fortunately more care has been taken with this collection.
As for the stories, the high standard set by the first series is maintained. The production values and scripts are all of the highest quality. The only downside is the awful short haircut that Jeremy Brett sports in four of the later episodes. Brett gave himself this haircut (he reportedly said that he felt like a change...but it may have been an act encouraged by the severe depression he was suffering at that time of his life), and it certainly doesn't suit the character or the period. It doesn't ruin the episodes by any means, but it is very distracting.
The extra features are well worth a mention, especially the interview with Edward Hardwicke who played Watson from this series onwards. He shares some wonderful stories and trivia from his time with the Granada series and it's definitely worth watching. The booklet containing episode notes written by Richard Valley is also excellent. Rather than just writing a synopsis of each story, Valley has included behind the scenes notes and quotes from interviews previously published in his magazine, Scarlet Street.
This is an essential purchase for fans of Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes. It will also appeal to general viewers who appreciate period drama with excellent scripts, performances and production values.",1062892800,24,2289,4.826972010178117
342593,4,6301611810,"Granada's Sherlock Holmes series concludes its move into DVD format with this well priced 5 disc set. Like its predecessor, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", Holmes is portrayed by Jeremy Brett: he is, as others have noted, the ""definitive Sherlock Holmes"". I cannot imagine anyone ever excelling Brett in this role. Watson is played by Edward Hardwicke, the son of noted actor, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, and he, too is definitive in the role. Everything is near perfect in this set, including the adaptions from the Doyle stories, and the very real sense of being in 19th century England. I have only one reservation: the tape to disc transfer is far from perfect. I do not know whether this is a reflection of poor storeage of the master tapes or sloppy transfer procedures. The result is a fair amount of ""ghosting"", especially in the night scenes. Having noted this, the performances are, without an exception, excellent. No fan of ""the world's first consulting detective"" should be without this set.",1062633600,89,1003,4.976190476190476
342594,4,6301611810,My wife and I have been enjoying these episodes since we got the DVD collection.  Each of the episodes is well done and clear.  We truly enjoy each of these shows.  The only dissapointment is that there are no subtitles.

342595,5,6301611810,"I'd seen some episodes of Granada's Sherlock Holmes series years ago, on Mystery! or A&E, but had almost forgetten all about it when I came across a copy of The Bruce-Partington Plans in a local store. Watching it made me very keenly regret not having taped the series back when it was regularly aired.
Jeremy Brett, though aging and with a not-very-flattering haircut here, carries the show. There's a longstanding dispute over who is the better Holmes, Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett. Personally, my vote is entirely with Brett--his Holmes is brilliant and eccentric, and not always an entirely sympathetic character, just as the Holmes of the original stories was. He's moody, self-superior, and full of dramatic gestures sometimes at the expense of others, not much like Rathbone's much smoother and calmer portrayal, and though it makes him harder to like, it makes him worlds more interesting a character.
Charles Gray as Mycroft very nearly steals a few scenes from Brett. They play off each other with marvelously entertaining results, right from Mycroft's entrance into the episode (""Sherlock!"" ""MY-croft!"").
Kudos go as well to Edward Hardwicke, who plays a solid and dependable Watson, frequently several steps behind Holmes but, for once, not portrayed as a total idiot to further glorify Holmes' intellect, as frequently happens in other portrayals.
The episode stays very close to the original story, with whole blocks of dialogue used nearly verbatim. The careful period detail makes everything that much more believable, and fascinating to look at if you have an interest in the Victorian period. I'm a big fan of Patrick Gowers' musical compositions, which are judiciously used throughout the series, as well.
Jeremy Brett is one of those people who I would cheerfully pay to hear read the phone book; he has a wonderfully dramatic voice, rising and falling from a gentle murmur to a commanding shout and through a whole range of moods and tones between. He really does capture Holmes' genius beautifully, and the Bruce-Partington Plans is a solid story in its own right, intellectually engaging and wholly believable.
Some favorite moments:
Holmes waxing passionate over Mycroft's unusual visit, and pretty much any interaction between the two of them.
Holmes' vaguely superior reaction to being mistaken for a mortician--so much conveyed just by looking aside and leaving Watson to clear up the mistake.
Harassing the longsuffering Mrs. Hudson while trying to spread out the city map--he's really awful, and it gets me giggling every time. In a similar vein, his sudden snort of mirth and abrupt, excessively cheerful departure, leaving Watson bemused in his wake.
Convincing Watson to come house-breaking (""We're BOUND to go."") and Watson reluctantly caving in--AGAIN.
And Watson being the one to pick up on a clue that Holmes nearly dismisses. He even has the grace not to gloat. :)",1006214400,6,2903,5.178723404255319

Brett's Holmes is definitive in my mind, and I've seen all the other actors who have played him. Brett truly and absolutely is Holmes. He springs straight from Conan Doyle's writing with all the delightful quirkiness and brilliance his creator imagined. Edward Hardwicke as Watson, is a perfect foil and companion, intelligent and capable in his own right, but ever the friend and subdued chronicler of his more brilliant...and often baffling and frustrating...associate. I first started watching this as the original BBC T.V. series in the 1980's and was thrilled to find it on DVD.

A man buys a railroad ticket and rushes out. [Was that a model train?] Later workers find a dead man alongside railroad tracks! There is a thick fog outside. Mycroft Holmes and a Scotland Yard Inspector visits over an important matter of National Security. A secret document is missing, it was found on the body of Cadogan West. Sherlock must solve this problem. They inspect the railroad tracks. Then they go to visit Sir James Walter but meet his brother Valentine. Sir James cant talk now. Next its Cadogan Wests fiance; she said West had been worried lately. Holmes learns about the security features. Why was the original taken when a copy wouldnt be missed? Holmes gets the names and addresses of the likely foreign agents and checks them against a map of London. [Note the right to carry a concealed pistol then.]

Only one address is next to that railroad line. Holmes inspects this house at night. He finds blood by the window near that railroad line. They look at the papers strewn on the desks, newspapers are in the fireplace. Holmes comes up with a scheme to identify the spy. Inspector Gregson says Holmes methods cant be used by the police. [Is this still true?] That night a man arrives. He tells what happened that night. He needed the money badly! Will he help the Government by making reparations? A letter with an offer will bring that foreign agent back. [We see how papers are passed in plain sight.] Splendid! We are keeping him on a long leash.

  These episodes are direct adaptions of Conan Doyle's timeless works, with only mild changes of necessity due to the change in mediums--page to screen. The costumes are glorious, the sets magnificent--you BELIEVE it's all real; it doesn't look like a set.

  I won't go into summaries; it is likely you know the stories, and I dare not spoil them for anyone who doesn't. All I can say is that these are the most truthful and masterful adaptations of the original stories I have ever had the pleasure to watch.
  The supporting cast is brilliant--especially Rosalie Williams as Mrs. Hudson!

  Watson--or shall I say the Watsons? Because there are two different Watsons--is brilliantly portrayed by David Burke, then later by Edward Hardwicke in a seemingly flawless transition. David Burke plays Watson as a man constantly impressed with Holmes--his portable audience as it were--I quite enjoyed it; it reminds me of how Watson speaks of Holmes in the stories. Edward Hardwicke's Watson older, and is less amazed with Sherlock and more merely tolerant of his eccentricities; he also seems to realize that Sherlock must be cared for or he'll burn himself out--which is also quite in line with Watson in the stories as he often despairs of Sherlock's disregard for his own health and well-being. Bravo to both Watsons--I cannot choose a favorite.

  Now for Jeremy Brett's Sherlock.

  Jeremy Brett's definitive portrayal of one of the greatest literary characters of all time--Sherlock Holmes--has, for me, eclipsed all others. Not one Sherlock I have ever seen can compare to him.(Before everyone freaks out I must say that I love Sherlock in all his incarnations and mean no disrespect to any other portrayals. Because every Sherlock has their virtues.)He IS Sherlock, there is no other way to describe it. Every nuance, every habit, every motion, every word that Sherlock has ever said--is evident in Jeremy's performance. The rapid changes in mood; the frenetic bursts of energy followed by lethargy; the constant control of emotions, and the fleeting, tantalizing glimpses of Sherlock's heart; the rapidity of his singular brain; the sometimes blatant disregard for his own safety; those lovely monologues of pure deduction, given in that offhand way--in Jeremy's beautiful, modulated, perfect diction; the addictions; the violin--the plain eccentricity and enigma that is Sherlock! From the second I first laid eyes on Jeremy's Sherlock, before he even spoke--I believed it; I believed in him.

  I believed in Sherlock Holmes all over again.

  I can state with absolute certainty that no one in their right mind could regret purchasing this series. Honestly.",1391126400,,2917,5.081932773109243

343034,5,6301611810,"After watching Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, it is impossible to even imagine someone else in that role. And after you have watched him as Watson, the same can be told for Edward Hardwicke as well. These men graced this unbelievably rich & detailed Granada production that has assumed legendary fame not just because of the production values or the stories (many of them had been dramatised considerably), but because of the authenticity & honesty they rendered the characters. As you watch this series, you slowly get to see the terrible shadow of illness elongating itself over Jeremy Brett, which would eventually kill him. But even then, as his physical activity got severely hampered and those regal (and acidic) play of head & fingers became rarer, we got to see a Holmes who was NOT the calculating machine as his creator had envisioned him, but as a genius, chased by his demons (glimpses of whom can be seen during the ""Devil's Foot"" episode) and visions. Also, this series saw the last flash of wit & adventure combined, since the later episodes had become grimmer, darker, and eventually unsatisfactory (except those parts where we sat mesmerised by Jeremy Brett). The episodes covered in these discs are:

1) The Empty House
2) The Priory School
3) The Second Strain
4) The Musgrove Ritual
5) The Abbey Grange
6) The Man with the Twisted Lip
7) The Six Napoleons
8) The Sign of Four
9) The Devil's Foot
10) Silver Blaze
11) Wisteria Lodge
12) The Bruce Partington Plans
13) The Hound Of The Baskervilles

Conan Doyle would have been proud to see his stories presented this way.

Two problems.

Many of the adaptations seem to have been padded to make them extend to the time required for the TV presentations;  there is a good deal in there that Conan Doyle never wrote.  And I have to say (even if I'm the only one who does) that Brett's Holmes is a touch exciting -  even hysterical  -  for the Holmes character.  Too loud, too flamboyant, and not really the right face shape for the reserved, ascetic, thin detective of Conan Doyle's creation.

No other actor or production captures the character of Sherlock Holmes as accurately as these. Doyle's Holmes is a flawed man:  narcissistically self indulgent and yet generous to those in need of his unique talents; a multiple drug abuser who gladly abandons his 7 and 1/2 percent solution when a mystery requires his energies for a solution; manipulative but rarely for the least personal gain. Holmes is a 20th century man sentenced to live in the 19th and sorely frustrated by the limitations of science and society.

Brett, an Olivier protege, was one of the great actors of his era before he came to this role some 25 years ago, and he created a Holmes that is difficult to imagine anyone equaling, let alone surpassing. Part of the reason for that is the overall quality of these Granada productions -- the writing, direction, music, and of course acting (one of the ironies of the series, though not in this particular set, is the appearance of a very young Jude Law as a stable boy in one of the Brett adventures; and another, now sadder sight is of a breathtakingly young and lovely Natasha Richardson as the Violet of The Copper Beeches).

This set features a beautifully directed (John Madden) version of The Priory School that is alone worth the price and makes this one you'll watch many times over. The adaptation of The Musgrave Ritual is ingenious, and the Man with the Twisted Lip is a production of both psychological and social depth.

The eleven episodes in ""The Return"" are actually drawn from all over the Sherlock Holmes canon. The adaptation to film from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories is generally excellent.  The episodes feature superb period details and location shooting around England.  Among the highlights in this collection: ""The Empty House"" in which Holmes returns from the seeming dead to shock the good Dr. Watson and Mrs. Hudson and to collar an old enemy using a unique weapon of assassination; ""The Musgrave Ritual"" in which Holmes and Watson investigate a modern murder with an ancient twist; and ""The Priory School"" in which the disappearence of a wealthy young heir leads to a nobleman's secrets.

Jeremy Brett, who suffered from illness in later installments of this series, is at the top of his very considerable form as Sherlock Holmes.  He captures all the quirks of the original, including his taster for theatricality and his baiting of Scotland Yard Inspector Lestrade, forever left in Holmes' investigative wake.  Edward Hardwicke is a capable counterpart as an eager Watson, less brillant but with people skills Holmes lacks.  Brett and Hardwicke truly capture the unique chemistry of the energetic and brillant but mercurial Holmes and the solid and patient Watson.  Special kudos are due Rosalie Williams, the long-suffering Mrs. Hudson, landlady of 221B Baker Street throughout the series, who gets a prominent role in ""The Empty House.""

This installment in the Grenada Television Sherlock Holmes series is very highly recommended to fans of Sherlock Holmes, who will find these one hour episodes to be highly entertaining and enjoyable.",1206489600,6,1901,5.373737373737374

343110,5,6301611810,"There's not much to add to the superlatives that seem to dominate these comments -- only to assure every Sherlock Holmes fan out there that these DVDs are a worthwhile investment.  The atmosphere of Holmes' London and the rooms on Baker Street is perfectly captured through the great period details, sets, costumes, and haunting music.  There are some weaknesses, including some rather arbitrary and often unnecessary alterations from the original source material (though it's fun to sit with a copy of the stories themselves and page through after each episode to find the discrepancies). Also, some of them seem to drag out at times, as the transfer from short story to hour-long program doesn't always work seamlessly, and every now and then there's a reminder of some of the weaker production values of the 80s (for example the rather comical effects of Holmes' African root-drug-induced hallucination in ""The Devil's Foot"").

But Jeremy Brett's masterful performances in just about every episode are worth sitting through all of it.  Of all the great Holmes actors, he seems to have best captured the character's kineticism and restlessness -- the sense of a raging mind always churning beneath the stern veneer.  Great stuff; highly recommended.",1184544000,3,1251,5.203980099502488

343112,5,6301611810,"There is no doubt that this DVD collection is essential viewing for any Sherlock Holmes enthusiast. For me, like many people out there, Jeremy Brett and Sherlock Holmes have always been one. I first discovered the dark and dangerous world of Holmes and Watson as a child during the mid to late-eighties, when Brett and Hardwicke were brilliantly bringing to life the most famous duo in literary history on PBS. Then I did not see these programs for many years, but to have them come out on DVD is long overdue. Just hearing the haunting opening bars of the period music composed for this landmark series by Patrick Gowers was enough to put a mischievous smile on my face!
  This collection features many of the detective's greatest exploits, including ""The Empty House,"" which features the emotional reunion of Holmes and Watson in 1894, and also one of my very favorite tales, ""The Devil's Foot,""  which has one of the most intriguing plots in the Canon. The film sequence when Holmes and Watson experiment with the deadly African root powder is extraordinary, especially when Holmes wakes from his horrifying hallucination and cries out to his companion, ""John!"" As any Sherlockian knows, this line does not appear in the original story, but Brett says it with such conviction and emotion that it doesn't really matter. Nor can one forget Holmes' unforgettable encounter with Leon Sterndale:
  ""How do you know that?""
  ""I followed you.""
  ""I saw no one.""
  ""That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.""

Equally powerful is the touching scene when Holmes literally cracks open the case of the Six Napoleons in front of Watson and Inspector Lestrade.

  ""Well,"" said Lestrade, ""I've seen you handle a good many
  cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more
  workmanlike one than that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland
  Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down
  to-morrow, there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the
  youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the
  hand.""
  ""Thank you!"" said Holmes. ""Thank you!"" and as he turned
 away, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the
 softer human emotions than I had ever seen him.""

To watch Brett choke up during this scene is wonderful.
These episodes remain quite faithful to the stories for the most part, but take a little artistic license at times, for instance in ""Wisteria Lodge"" and also the ""Bruce-Partington Plans"". The end of the atmospheric ""Priory School"" features a very dramatic scene which totally deviates from the original tale, but in fact may be an improvement! One of the extra features is a very enlightening commentary with director John Madden and John Stuart Davies about how they made ""The Priory School."" The interview with Edward Hardwicke on disc 1 is also fascinating. As a whole, these are the finest and most satisfying film versions of the Canon ever produced or ever likely to be. If you read the original stories as you watch these episodes, as I have done, you'll discover much of the dialogue is taken straight from the horse's mouth! (Sorry about the pun, but I just watched ""Silver Blaze""!) So do yourself a huge favor, and get this set today.  These dvds will offer countless hours of enjoyment and inspired deduction.

If you like the stories-you will love these film productions",1168992000,3,104,5.5
343185,5,6301611810,"""The Return of Sherlock Holmes"" marked the debut of Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson, replacing the much-beloved David Burke, who - for family and professional reasons - had moved on to other projects.  The transition of Watsons is virtually seamless, although most commentators agree that Hardwicke portrays a slightly older and more ""sober"" version of Watson.  Nonetheless, it is a rare thing in the world of entertainment for two actors occupying the same role to be equally cherished by the viewing public.

And now, on to the stories themselves.  Much has been said of the magic worked by Jeremy Brett and his two Watsons, but I would like to applaud the magnificent performances turned in by the numerous guest stars in the series.  The casting was superb, and I will emphasize that in my comments on the individual episodes.  I will not comment on each and every episode, but only on my particular favorites.

Silver Blaze - Peter Barkworth is splendid as Colonel Ross, the ruddy-faced owner of Silver Blaze, the favorite for the Wessex Cup who has disappeared days before the big race.  Barkworth perfectly captures the simultaneous amiablity, arrogance, and ultimate receptivity to the truth which characterizes wealthy sportsmen even to the present day (think of Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones).  The apparent murder of Silver Blaze's trainer, John Straker, adds to the mystery.

Those familiar with the original story will immediately recognize Barkworth as an absolutely perfect choice for the role of Colonel Ross, and of Malcom Storry as Inspector Gregory.  Kudos also to Amanda-Jayne Beard as Edith Baxter, and Russell Hunter as the devious Silas Brown.

The Second Stain - Patricia Hodge nails the role of Lady Hilda Trelawny Hope.  Just nails it.  Superb.  And Harry Andrews as Lord Bellinger provides believeable gravitas as an elder statesman puzzled by the mysterious disappearance of a document of extreme importance for European affairs.  And there is more - Colin Jeavons as Inspector Lestrade.  If only we could have seen more of him.  He perfectly captures the pomposity yet ultimate humility, humanity, and integrity  of Holmes's primary foil at Scotland Yard.  Even the minor roles - Yves Beneyton as the suave-but-duplicitous Eduardo Lucas - are perfectly cast and perfectly executed.

The Priory School - Excellent atmospherics as Holmes and Watson pursue the kidnapper of the son of the rich and famous Duke of Holdernesse.

The Six Napoleans - I found the script a bit confusing, but the acting is excellent.  Again, Colin Jeavons is outstanding as Lestrade, and the domestic scenes with Lestrade visiting 221B are charming and humorous.

The Abbey Grange - Anne Louise Lambert is excellent as the beautiful Lady Brackenstall, the transplanted Australian whose husband has been found brutally murdered.  Here we see Holmes taking the law into his own hands, as he often does.

The Devil's Foot - Again, Holmes takes the law into his own hands, faithful to Doyle's original story.  The bleak-but-splendid Cornish landscape adds to the mood, as does Brett's quirky portrayal of a depressed, irritable, and introspective Holmes.

The Man With the Twisted Lip - Well done, all around.  It is interesting to see Eleanor David, as Mrs. St. Clair, pushing Holmes's buttons and driving the action forward.  A strong woman, indeed.  Clive Francis is an excellent Neville St. Clair, and Denis Lill provides a convincing Inspector Bradstreet.",1167955200,10,3463,5.163375224416517

  Edward Hardwickes portrayal of Dr. Watson I believe was equally well done. They made a fine team; which in turn made for fine, and engrosssing entertainment.

343187,5,6301611810,"I am not one of those who like to watch television; as I find most of the programs [sitcoms in particular] to be boring and extremely dummed down. There have only been a few programs that really appealed to me, which is probably why I began amassing my own video collection. In between reading, painting, sculpting and listening to music, there was one exception: Sherlock Holmes. And not just any Sherlock Holmes television series; but for me the definitive series; that one exception to the rule: The Masterpiece Theatre programs of Sherlock Holmes, starring Jeremy Brett.

These terrific episodes starring the late Jeremy Brett were the few times I sat in front of the televion set and watched TV. The magnificent nuances of Jeremy Brett as the consumate detective were a sheer joy to watch. Oh, how he is missed. And although there were plans to do all 60 of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's episodes, at least we viewers were lucky enough to get the cream of the crop of the episodes. There undoubtedly will be other Sherlock Holmes taking up the mantle in the future, however, there will NEVER be another Sherlock Holmes like Jeremy Brett. He WAS Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, every inflection of his character portrayal of Holmes can never be duplicated. He was truly one of a kind.

Brett's magnificent nuances and eccentric behavior were a delight to watch. And thankfully, Granada Television has released even more great episodes of this talented performer on this 5 DVD collection with 11 more great epsiodes of the late, great Jeremy Brett as the consumate detective and definitive Sherlock Holmes. New to the series, however, is Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson: And his character performance is top-notch and outstanding.

The 11 new episodes continues where the first 13 episodes leave off. After Sherlock's supposed demise at the hands of Professor Moriarty, Dr. Watson  is confronted with the great news that his dear friend is still alive. And so continues the series. And as usual the excellent writing and acting continues in these 11 episodes. Some of the episodes are ""Silver Blaze"" ""The Six Napoleons,"" and ""The Musgrave Ritual"". I highly recommend these outstanding episodes of Jeremy Brett as the greatest Sherlock Holmes to ever grace the screen and play the role of Sherlock Holmes.

343188,5,6301611810,"On reviewing this excellent Granada series, one must always keep in mind two separate criteria. One, the original writing of Doyle and two, the Granda production team, including of course the now legendary performance of Jeremy Brett, without question now the ultimate Holmes for the 20th century. You can't really fault the Granda production for what is unfortunately, some of Doyle's weaker stories such as Lady Carfax, for instance.

In this series of 11 episodes however, both the writing and the production are top notch all the way, and it is arguably the best collection of the whole group.

Doyle purists may prefer the Adventures, and with good reason, for the stories were fresh, creative and Doyle had not yet tired of writing about his famous detective.

But was it luck or theatrical Fate that brought Edward Hardwicke into the series, precisely at the point where Holmes and Watson's relationship necessarily becomes more personal and complex - right from the first episode where Watson displays a range of emotions upon finding Holmes alive in ""The Empty House""?

Although David Burke does an admirable job in the first series, it is Hardwicke who is able to take us further into the personal ups and downs of their friendship with all the humor and understanding that fully fleshes out the two main characters.

Hardwicke's subtle psychological insight into Watson's role is only one of the rewards of this magnificent series.

Where else will you see the humanity of Holmes so revealed as in ""The Devil's Foot"" - the only time Holmes ever addresses Watson as ""John"" - as he battles his cocaine addiction? Where else will you see a more mature and compassionate Holmes comforting women in distress, as in ""The Man With the Twisted Lip""?

Holmes is never better than when solving a murder mystery, and you get that in spades here, as in ""The Devil's Foot"", ""The Abbey Grange"" and ""Silver Blaze"". ""The Six Napoleons"" takes us into the Italian subculture, and ""Wisteria Lodge"" into Latin American politics. And Jeremy Brett was never better than in the scenes where he discovers the ancient crown of England, or the consummate acting job - using only his facial expressions - to reveal his insights into the secret of ""The Second Stain"".

There's something for every Sherlock Holmes fan here. And again, what really makes this group of episodes stand out is the richness and humanity between the characters, not only between Holmes and Watson, but also with Mrs. Hudson and the Scotland Yard inspectors. Even Mycroft, Holmes brother, makes an appearance in ""The Bruce Partington Plans"", which further humanizes Holmes character as we see the two brothers relationship developed more.

What are you waiting for? Buy this series now! You'll enjoy it again and again.

The sets, and writing are great, and the overall feel of the episodes stays true to the stories Conan Doyle wrote.

My big problem is the transfer.  All the other boxsets in the series look much better than this.  The Casebook, Memoirs, and the Feature Film box sets look amazing, and even the Adventures do not look horrible (sure there are flaws), but this set (The Return) looks and horrible.  The audio is not that good either.  I feel like I am watching a medium quality streaming video.  I feel like I overpaid for this box set, because if one comes out that has a better quality, I am definatly going to replace this one.

Hopefully MPI will get better transfers.  Other than the video quality, you will definately get your moneys worth.",1138233600,6,1252,4.395652173913043
343242,5,6301611810,"There are times when an actor grabs a role and makes it his own.  This was surely the case with Jeremy Brett.  Whenever I see or think about Sherlock Holmes it is Jeremy's face and mannerisms that come to mind.  Edward Hardwicke made a wonderful Watson..an intelligent sleuth partner.  Doyle's Watson can't be a bumbling fool..reading the books shows this.  It is great to see the sensitive, intelligent medical man that Watson is portrayed correctly.

This series from Granada Television carries all the atmosphere of Victorian England.  It was filmed in and around Liverpool and Cheshire for the wonderful mansions and scenery.

Starting with the resurrection from Reichenbach Falls, this is a great addition to any Sherlock Holmes collection.  Brett played Holmes with such great exuberance and enthusiasm that it truly is a shame that he is no longer with us to complete the filming of the 19 remaining Sherlock Holmes stories. (He was able to film 36 episodes and 5 films out of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes canon.)",1134345600,5,1015,4.994047619047619
343243,4,6301611810,"I love Jeremy Brett in the role of Holmes and love the series. One question about this particular MPI 5 disk package... WHERE are the extras? Maybe I'm just being blind but for the life of me I can't find them anywhere! Can anyone out there point me to how I get to them? I've searched all 5 disks' menus and I see nothing that indicates either the Hardwicke interview nor the director's commentary. Did MPI simply forget to include them? Argh!

UPDATE: I contacted MPI directly and sorted things out. There were supposed to be extras (specifically on disks 1 and 3) but the set I got had the wrong disks in it. They mailed replacement DVDs at no extra charge. MPI scores huge points in my book for that!",1133395200,4,704,4.374045801526718
343244,5,6301611810,"&#65279;I need repeat neither the well-deserved accolades to Grenada's production of Sherlock Holmes and its star Jeremy Brett (1933-95) nor laments of the less-than perfect quality of the 11 episodes of Return telecast in 1986 (7 episodes) and 1988 (4 episodes). However, I do want to emphasize the extras: the classy 12-page booklet with Richard Valley's background production notes; the touching interview with Edward Hardwicke, ""Elementary, My Dear Watson"" (2003, TT18.40, on disk 1); and John Madden's informative director's commentary on ""The Priory School.""

Most of all I want to stress that the sequence of the 11 episodes on DVD is NOT the original broadcast sequence on TV! This is the proper viewing sequence of the 11 episodes:
The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1986, series 3)
  disk 1-1. The Empty House
  disk 1-2. The Abbey Grange
  disk 5-1. The Musgrave Ritual
  disk 2-1. The Second Stain
  disk 5-2. The Man with the Twisted Lip
  disk 3-1. The Priory School
  disk 2-2. The Six Napoleans
2-hour movie The Sign of Four (1987): separately available
The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1988, series 4)
  disk 4-1. The Devil's Foot
  disk 4-2. Silver Blaze
  disk 3-2. Wisteria Lodge
  disk 4-3. The Bruce-Partington Plans
This viewing sequence will place properly together the last four (1988) episodes where Brett sports that awful haircut and black scarf and where he is beginning to show physical effects (notably weight gain and puffiness) from the medication he was taking for his bipolar disorder (manic depression) diagnosed in early 1986. The crew-cut hairdo apparently was self-inflicted during a manic phase.",1125878400,18,1629,5.180769230769231

Overall a worthwhile acquisition, especially for Jeremy Brett fans like me.",1125619200,7,261,5.55
343246,4,6301611810,"Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick come together as Holmes & Watson in some of the greatest adaptations of these great stories ever.  Both actors are at the top of their game.  My only criticism is that unlike some of the more recent releases, this DVD edition appears to have been taken straight from the video.  The screen is very dark and grainy, making it look like it was taped off the TV rather than remastered for digital.

I've seen some of the more recent DVD releases including the ""Casebook"" and the crisp images are far better than these.  That said, the price on the ""Return"" DVD is low and who knows how long it will take them to come out with a new remastered edition.

I would also hope for more commentary on the next edition.  Extras including Vincent Price's excellent introductions for the ""Mystery"" series would be great. Holmes without Price isn't quite the same.",1125532800,4,883,4.621794871794871

This movie is based on the story ""The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans"" (1908) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

Sherlock's smarter brother and government worker Mycroft (Charles Gray) tells Sherlock about a young man found murdered and beaten on a railway line leading from the underground.  What makes this murdered man so special is that he had seven pages of stolen plans for a government secret submarine in one of his pockets.  Three pages of these plans are still missing.

Mycroft asks Sherlock (Jeremy Brett) to find out the real truth behind this murder, determine if the murdered man was a traitor, and to find the rest of the missing government submarine plans.  Holmes' agrees to take on this most challenging case.

To find the truth, Sherlock and Watson (Edward Hardwicke) have to break the law!

Brett (as usual) does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.

Finally, the costumes, background music, attention to detail, and cinematography are quite well done.  A highlight of this movie is the creation of the foggy streets of London.

In conclusion, this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it's based on!!

(1988;  55 min.;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)

343248,5,6301611810,"This excellent TV show perfectly captures the mystery and excitement of Doyle's original short stories.  The acting, dialogue, set and costume production are all of high quality and make for a completely believable experience. Brett is a singularly most delightful Holmes and Hardwicke admirably replaces Burke as Dr. Watson. The friendship between and adventures of the two characters are wonderfully brought to life.

Sadly, despite all the love I have for the show, the DVD set does not meet some standards you may expect. First, the quality of the digital transfer is terrible. Granada has said the film's original master was damaged in their vault, but I know badly encoded MPEG when I see it. Ghosting, muddled blacks, and that characteristic ""blockiness"" in regions of high movement. The audio also seems badly mixed at times, occasionally making the dialogue harder to understand. The second problem is the flimsy case holding all the DVDs. The very first time I opened it I was worried I might break it.

So how to rate this item when the content is excellent, but the vehicle so unfortunately poor? I love collecting well produced DVDs, but when it comes down to it, I'm there to enjoy the cinema. And with all the enjoyment this series brings, I must give this DVD the highest rating possible.",1108857600,8,1304,4.918181818181818
343249,5,6301611810,"""The Bruce Partington Plans"" was one of Arthur Conan Doyle's finest Sherlock Holmes stories, a ripping yarn that is well-paced and creatively plotted. Little adaption was needed to turn this superb mystery into another fine Holmes film starring Jeremy Brett. From the loftiest government officials to the lowliest train conductors, all the actors here do a splendid job, and the foggy, moody London atmosphere has been captured wonderfully, as has the period detail. What's not to like? The mysterious body found thrown from a train, the high stakes government papers, the messages sent through the agony column of the daily telegraph, the murky burgled house... great stuff for mystery buffs!",1102377600,,693,5.3090909090909095
