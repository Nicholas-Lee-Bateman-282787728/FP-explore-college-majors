Together, we went to the car lots armed with a plan and good information and the car buying process was demystified. We ended up with an excellent used car in great shape that he is very happy with and we saved several thousand dollars in the process. I think that is worth the price of the program!!!

Really, the confidence in knowing the techniques that are used by the professional car sellers and how to work around them is invaluable. I highly recommend this DVD.

Update May 5, 2017: I just helped my son purchase his first new car and the principles in this video once again helped us save thousands of dollars. I continue to highly recommend!",1283817600,,877,4.401234567901234
