7833216,1,6302986001,"The quality of this VHS was terribly. I work with elderly residents and wanted an exercise video. The residents could not stand to watch it because of a very irritating buzzing sound throughout the VHS. It came from Parrot books in Seattle and I couldn't find a way to return it.  I'm sure the 30 days is up now, but I would never order from Parrot books again.",1371945600,2,361,4.3088235294117645
