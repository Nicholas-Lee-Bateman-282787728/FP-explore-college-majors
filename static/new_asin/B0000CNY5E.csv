1920207,1,B0000CNY5E,The movie considered to be the worst movie ever is Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. That movie was more entertaining than this. This takes a funny TV show and makes it look awful. I agree with what the person said about feeding the hungry children in one of the other reviews.,1105142400,15,278,4.264150943396227
1920208,1,B0000CNY5E,"I've no doubt I'm one of many products of the baby boom who endured this dreadful flick because of fond memories of the original Car 54 series. The series, of course, was no intellectual banquet, but it had charm and  fun.
 This film version's one-joke premise is that Gunther Toody, whose  facial expression and manner would make one wonder if those with lower  intelligence than Neanderthal man are candidates for the NYPD, cannot keep  his hands off his wife. Dreadful bore.",964051200,26,477,4.839506172839506
1920209,5,B0000CNY5E,"Judging by the preponderous of one star reviews I must be a majority of one in my adulation for this flick.  For whatever reason it struck a chord with me.  I bought this at a store that was liquidating it's stock and it intrigued me.  Maybe it has something to do with my affinity for star David Johansen.  I was fortunate to see him live four times in both his Buster Poindexter persona and the latest incarnation of the New York Dolls.  Johansen brings the same manic energy to ""Car 54"" that he brought to his music performances.  Johansen also impressed me in his other prominent screen efforts, ""Scrooged"" and ""Let it Ride"".  Also, how can you go wrong with a deliciously eclectic cast that includes John C. McGinley, Jeremy Piven, Fran Drescher, Nipsey Russell, and ""Grampa"" Al Lewis.  Even the odious Rosie O'Donnell couldn't ruin the flick for me.  The movie is not so much funny but goofy in a surreal kind of way.  It owes itself more to the ""Police Academy"" or ""Naked Gun"" movies than the original TV series.  I loved this movie so shoot me.",1262995200,5,1052,4.5132275132275135
1920210,1,B0000CNY5E,"I was looking for thr old TV show for a friend, didn't realize this was the awful movie they made. it is horable",1261958400,,112,3.9130434782608696
1920211,1,B0000CNY5E,"Even though I hate Hollywood remakes of ""classic"" TV, I had semi-high hopes for this, just based on David Johansen's acting in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrooged/dp/6305609764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrooged</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-It-Ride/dp/B00005N5SC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let It Ride</a>&nbsp;, plus John C. McGinley and Fran Dreschler. Jeeezus, this piece of junk is at least as painful as watching Rain Phoenix, Uma Thurman, & Angie Dickinson stumble through ""EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES"".",1217203200,,621,8.873015873015873
1920212,1,B0000CNY5E,"Forget waterboarding, just play this.  You'll have to shoot 'em to shut 'em up.",1216684800,2,79,4.642857142857143
1920213,3,B0000CNY5E,"I had to have this strictly because of former New York Doll, David Johansen. Weak plot, crappy acting, crummy effects...but a must if you like obscure stuff by a original NYD. Hey, buy it, it's cheap.",1206748800,4,200,4.583333333333333
1920214,3,B0000CNY5E,"I liked the movie....it made me laugh out loud several times. But then again I have all of Woody Allen's movies on DVD. Fran, from the ""Nanny"" played a happy go lucky prostitute...did a good job. It won't be confused with ""Gone with the wind"" or even ""Who's the man?"" but it made me laugh.....Sometimes people take movies too seriously.",1154131200,7,336,4.616666666666666
1920215,1,B0000CNY5E,"No.  Not this piece of dreck ""movie"".  Where (or when) will the humorous series be available on DVD?  Just about every TV show imaginable has had a DVD release (wheither desired or not).  Car 54 and, until recently, Sgt. Bilko were nowhere to be found. Poor Ernie Bilko gets a ""best of"" rather then a richly deserving season by season treatment. By the way, instead of that very rotten Car 54 movie, you'll get more yucks staring at a clock.  A stopped one at that. The makers of this mess should be arrested.  Avoid at all costs.",1151452800,6,530,4.412371134020619
1920216,1,B0000CNY5E,"That is really saying something about how bad this movie is.

So bad, it's even beneath the legions of AOL users to enjoy it.",1137196800,9,125,4.208333333333333
1920217,1,B0000CNY5E,"I would love to see the old tv show on dvd. and PLEASE, RELEASE THE PHIL SILVERS SHOW ON DVD.I would buy all of them.",1121817600,8,117,3.72
1920218,1,B0000CNY5E,I only wish the ratings went below 1 star because this crap fest doesn't even deserve that. I probably shouldn't even be acknowledging the existence of this film by giving it a rating.,1115856000,10,184,4.606060606060606
7999539,1,B0000CNY5E,"i grew up watching re-runs of car 54, and i loved the show, but this is one of the stupidest tv adaptions ever made into a movie, was so happy i did not buy it, i saw it on television and did not even watch the whole thing, got to a point and just had to turn the channel, it was killing me, but i still love the classic tv show though!",1504483200,,336,3.6805555555555554

7999545,1,B0000CNY5E,"This movie is terrible!  It's pretty much unwatchable!  The original show is classic, but this is rotten!  Stay away from this mess!",1393027200,,132,4.909090909090909
7999546,3,B0000CNY5E,"The movie was kinda ""blah"", and the DVD transfer looked like it was done using a higher quality VHS recording. I remember liking this movie when I was a kid, but then again, I didn't know any better. If you are buying this product due to the fact that it has John C. McGinley and Jeremy Piven in it, then you might like it. Other than that, don't waste your time on this product. I paid almost $5 for it (shipping included). It's really not worth any more than that.",1393027200,,466,4.188888888888889
7999547,1,B0000CNY5E,"This movie surely deserves less than one star. Many less.  Too Bad Amazon doesn't allow for that.  I loved the original series and especially Fred Guinn.  The actor (can we call that acting?) is so bad it's jaw-dropping.  This is near the bottom of the barrell as far as it goes.  Like others have said, Plan 9 From  Outer Space was bad, but at least Ed Wood attempted to make it as good as he could and really thought he did make a good film.  There was no attempt in this case.  This car belongs in the scrap heap.  Please do not sell a copy if you get one since you'd be subjecting others to this undue torture.",1324252800,,614,4.135593220338983
