8666434,5,B00LLPYURC,Great dvd and an history of firefighting in the USA,1532131200,,51,4.2
8666435,5,B00LLPYURC,"If one is a history buff, one will love this fantastic documentary of the raging, runaway woodland fires that that devastated the Northwest in 1910, resulting in over three million acres of forest burned away. The fires resulted in great loss of property and lives. It also honed in on how little the national psyche knew about fighting this type of fire. It changed the way that the National Forest Service would fight these fires in the future and brought about congressional funding.

With archival footage and photographs, coupled with excellent narration, the devastating forest fires of 1910 are brought to life for the viewer. The documentary also highlights the role of the buffalo soldiers in fighting these fires. All who fought to stop these fires were, indeed, the bravest of the brave, as they did so with primitive tools and only with the most rudimentary knowledge of firefighting. This is a gripping narrative that  history buffs will enjoy. It is simply first rate!",1513468800,,982,4.9817073170731705

8666438,5,B00LLPYURC,"Husband is a Wildland Firefighter and I am a history buff....the movie was perfect for both of us!

This movie is shorter but really full of great information about the big fires in our Nations history as well as Ed Pulaski one of the fathers of firefighting techniques and tools used today. My husband has always mentioned him but seeing images through this documentary really helped me get a broad understanding of the impact these events and people had.

Quality of production are very high and great work was taken to compile wonderful photographs and people to interview. I was very pleased with the movie as a whole and we plan to share with family and friends.",1448150400,3,667,4.6923076923076925

8666442,5,B00LLPYURC,"I am a long time fan of American Experience. There is truly a ""fire "" (sorry) of inspiration devotion and dedication to the projects chosen that show us and share with parts of America we could only have read about.  Using our personal imagination and imagery is often superior to that seen on film, however this is one that has scenes none of us could create unless we had actually been caught in the burns described.  This documentary is filled with the sheer power of fire and our utter lack of any control or power to cause it to do anything but what the fires choose to do.  It is empathetic, scary, authentic and extremely will done!",1427846400,7,639,4.444444444444445
8666443,4,B00LLPYURC,"After few years of drought, late in the evening of July 26, 1910, Ed Pulaski awoke to hear heavens unleash a deafening, almost continuous volley of thunder, lightning with no rain. By the next morning, nearly 1,000 fires were burning across 22 National Forests in the northern Rockies. By the second week of August, it doubled to 2,500 fires. This was in 1910 with no technology, no Internet, no planes, no trucks, no equipment except axes and shovels. More than three million acres of forest had burned and a billion dollar of lumber had been lost. Soot from the fires darkened sunsets as far as Boston. This documentary chronicles what it took to create the US Forest Service. Bravo.",1423353600,6,685,4.764705882352941
