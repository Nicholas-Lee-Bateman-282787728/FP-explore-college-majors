4531679,1,B0052W9UHK,"If you have all 3 seasons of ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from the series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. ""Pompeii and Circumstance"", ""The San Franpsycho"" and ""Fright House of a Lighthouse"" all come from ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" so if you got all 3 seasons don't buy this and if you don't buy them instead of wasting your money for 3 episodes, especially if you're a Scooby fan. Happy shopping.",1314489600,36,645,4.252032520325203

4531689,5,B0052W9UHK,"My 3-y/o grandson is hooked on Scooby-Doo.  I have about 14 DVDs now.  They aren't available at local stores.  The price on Amazon is reasonable.  I have two more younger grandsons.  These will provide years of enjoyment.  I particularly like the early shows, made in 69-70.  The later ones (Mystery Inc.) are too adult for him to enjoy. Maybe 8-9 y/o.  Stick with the 60's cartoon and your kids/grandkids will have an appropriate and safe experience.  I highly recommend.",1359763200,,472,4.8734177215189876
