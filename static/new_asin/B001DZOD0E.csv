3544537,1,B001DZOD0E,"Sorry i bought this dvd. The animation is equal to ren and stimpy, with Aged actors trying to sing (SHIRLEY JONES). Maybe good for kids.",1228348800,2,136,4.48
3544538,4,B001DZOD0E,"I bought this DVD last week, and it's packed with stars including Jay Leno (narrator), Shirley Jones, Kathy Bates and many others.

The main character is played by young Madison Davenport (see bonus material on the DVD). She has a wonderful singing voice. We'll no doubt hear/see more of her in future movies.

The story is original, touching, and well-paced. I think this DVD would make a great Christmas gift for kids between the ages of 4 and 9, but I enjoyed it too (and I'm MUCH older than that!).",1227312000,3,502,4.566666666666666
3544539,5,B001DZOD0E,"What a charming and delightful Christmas movie that reminds me of the ones they used to make, where the true meaning of Christmas isn't found inside a department store, and isn't about finding a boyfriend.  I LOVE the way the story of the birth of Jesus and the story of Santa are intertwined - told in a way that this Catholic found absolutely inventive and endearing.  The character design is inspired and original, and the entire look takes you into a wonderful fantasyland.  Pure magic!",1226188800,3,490,4.741176470588235
3544540,5,B001DZOD0E,"This is a great Christmas movie for the whole family. It is an instant classic among the likes of Charlie Brown Christmas, The Polar Express, and Rudolph. It is not just for kids, but people of all ages. Families can start a tradition by watching the movie every Christmas. It has an incredible cast and amazing animation. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for some Christmas cheer.",1226188800,3,407,4.746478873239437
3544541,5,B001DZOD0E,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to go out and buy a copy of this film for my family to watch. It sure put us in the holiday spirit and we all cannot wait to watch it again! The animation is done so beautifully that the characters and scenes just seem to come alive. The voice actors in this movie is what really attracted me to the film - quite a diverse group of actors, all of whom are great and truly shine in this film.

The music is quite catchy and enjoyable, the characters are lovable, and the story is an inspiration that provides humor and hope for all! I'm so glad that the film brought in a way to describe what the holiday season really is all about. Go out and buy this film! I know it will be enjoyed by my family for many years to come; it surely will not disappoint you this holiday season! Proudly give this 5 Stars!",1226188800,16,844,4.115151515151515
3544542,5,B001DZOD0E,"Not since the Charlie Brown Christmas special in the 60's has a mainstream ""Hollywood"" Christmas special mentioned the word Jesus. With all the secularist trying to replace the word ""Christmas"" with the word ""Holiday,"" it was so refreshing to see a film that recognizes the true meaning of Christmas. There's a short thirty second part where the origin of Santa's bag is explained. It is made from the swaddling clothes that wrapped the baby Jesus in the manger. Santa brings gifts to all the children every year to remind them of the gift we all were given on that day. It's that simple, but as a Christian parent I appreciate the connection being made between Santa and the true meaning of Christmas without being preachy. With all the commercialization of Christmas, it's easy to see why people forget the reason why we celebrate it.

We ordered this film on PayPerView and the kids loved it so much that I ended up buying them the DVD. The animation design is beautiful to look at (such a nice departure from the cheap computer graphics that seems to be all the rage), the actors are top notch, the story is sweet, the music is fun and it wasn't too scary for my youngest 4 year old (like most of the ""G"" rated films I attempt to take him to in the theater). Thanks Hollywood for finally making something truly for my whole family.",1226188800,2,1335,4.5625
3544543,2,B001DZOD0E,I made the mistake of buying this based on others reviews. It had the potential to be a classic but... My kids kept asking me to fast forward over the parts with the villan Krag who lives in a Middle earth like domain in what looks like Hell with evil little monsters. Santas bag made from Christs swaddling clothes even bothered my seven year old. It had great animation and great voice work but to offensive for Christians.,1226102400,8,425,4.461538461538462
3544544,5,B001DZOD0E,"I get so tired of all the movies aimed at kids that are filled with sarcasm, adult references and music video edits. ""Christmas Is Here Again"" is different! It reminds me of the classics I grew up with. This is a real adventure story, filled with characters you'll care about -- and the animation is beautiful. What more could you ask for? If you've been looking for a new and wonderful Christmas story to share with your family, this is it.",1226102400,4,441,4.45679012345679
3544545,5,B001DZOD0E,"I was in Target the other day and my six year old daughter saw this DVD and had to have it. I hadn't heard of this movie before, but I recognized all the cast and it looked adorable so I bought it for her. I'm so glad I did! She absolutely loved it. She's watched it twice already today.

The movie is full of catchy songs that had my daughter humming along. It reminds me of the Christmas specials I grew up with. The animation is beautiful, it has humor and is touching. The story kept her interested (and me, too).

Over the years I've tried new holiday specials and have never found one that lives up to the one's I grew up with as a kid...until now.  Christmas Is Here Again is a movie I know we'll be watching for years to come.",1225843200,3,734,4.083333333333333
3544546,5,B001DZOD0E,"At last a new Christmas movie in the tradition of Charlie Brown.  Heart, hope, humor, compassion, a good story.  The animation is beautiful.  Sophiana will be an inspiration to children to try their best, help each other, and to believe that dreams do come true if you work at them.  A must have for every family library. A perfect gift too.  I've already bought three!!!",1225843200,5,371,4.6461538461538465

3544553,1,B001DZOD0E,"Cute cover, but we did not enjoy this movie.  There is a very scary looking (and sounding) character in it and we had to fast forward through the scenes that he was in.  This character lived underground and had a host of minions working for him.  They had stolen Santa's sack and kept it underground hidden and as a result, the world had not celebrated Christmas for many years.  The other parts of the movie were cheesy.

3544556,1,B001DZOD0E,"We chose this on a whim without viewing it/ reading reviews first and I regret it. We had to turn it off when our 5 year old burst into tears. It is truly terrible. If this had been written in the '50s, I would have chalked it up to simply being a dated reflection of the times. It's a truly bizarre story considering it came out in 2007. The movie shows Dickensian like child abuse, has terrible music that honestly sounds like the singers are making up the lyrics as they go along, and some outdated ideas about what boys and girls can be when the grow up. It also has a bizarre twist that I imagine might offend some Christians. Santa's sack has been stolen, so no more Christmas. Why is the sack so special? Because it was originally used to wrap the ""Christ Child."" Yep, that's when Santa began delivering gifts.  Make of that what you will. The bad guy who stole the sack is clearly a Satan like figure that transforms selfish children into very frightening looking zombies forced to mine coal in a pit of fire. This is what made my 5 year cry, and us turn off the TV.

3544571,2,B001DZOD0E,"For starters, we were expecting this movie to be ""The Christmas Bunny"" because we didn't bother looking at the title.  We only looked at the thumbnail of the movie...which is a completely different movie. Secondly, it was a bit dark and weird.  I would not let anyone younger than maybe 6 watch.  I watched it with my 7 year old and he said it was ""kinda creepy.""  It seemed like the movie could've possibly been made up as they went with no real way to end certain scenes so they just ended them.  The music wasn't awful as some reviewers said, but it wasn't anything that gave me those nice, Christmas-y feelings...which I feel is important in a movie.  The animation was a throwback to those earlier 90'so cartoons.  Okay, if you like that kind of thing which I don't.  I would give it 1 star, but I'm an adult.  My 7 year old, however, said 2 stars.  He said it wasn't ""bad"", but he would never, ever watch it again.",1475539200,3,920,4.3274853801169595

3544583,5,B001DZOD0E,"This review is mainly towards animators. Firstly, great story. Pretty original I'd say. The overall concept is the same but well put together. Now, if you are an animator and like cut-out animation style this is great. And the geometric shapes of the environment like the trees and homes is very cool. Reminds me of the shapes in animated film ""The Secret of Kell's."" Many well put together sharp edges and vibrant colors. So, if you want some great ideas as an animator, look at this film.",1451174400,,490,4.64367816091954

I was reminded of classic cartoons as I watched, and that was nice. I didn't expect the true meaning of Christmas to be a part of this musical animated tale along with Santa and elves. It was a pleasant surprise to see the birth of Jesus included.

Krad represents evil and darkness. Santa represents good and light. Children should know that the world isn't all good, that there is bad in the world. But parents of small children might want to view first. This film also sends the message that even when things look hopeless, dreams can come true.

Andy Griffith speaks for Santa. It was nice to hear his voice.

BUT THIS!! OH NO!  First of all- the animation was crap! I can't believe people are calling it ""artsy"" - it was cheap! The ""songs"" - in quotes, because I wouldn't even call them that - were just pathetic.  Who wrote them? A 10 year old could write better songs!  The plot was just waayyy to hokey for me and most of it just didn't come together cohesively.  The little girl was handicapped? Or was she? She needed a cane? Oh wait, she can run from a polar bear? WHAT?  OK.  Finally, and here is the kicker - the thing that just TURNED ME OFF COMPLETELY TO THIS MOVIE:  Santa's magical sack can't be replaced becuase....it's........MADE FROM THE BABY JESUS SWADDLING CLOTHES.... ?????  EXCUSE ME ...WHAT????  OH NO - that is just WRONG on SO MANY LEVELS!  I can't even discuss that issue any further.

The rest of the cast varies in depth from flatish (the main villain and his crew, Santa and most of his elves) but they do not detract from the overall story.  There are some songs, most of which are well-done.  The odd exception is the main villain's which even leads to some humor from the main cast.

3544609,5,B001DZOD0E,"In this age of media saturation, a parent is challenged each Christmas to find something fresh, new, age-appropriate and reflective of the real meaning behind Christmas.  This movie is all of that and more, and what makes it especially great is that, while it is essentially an exciting adventure story about helping Santa, it also gives appropriate andrespectful nod to the baby Jesus being the reason for the season--in the same way that the old perennial Santa Claus is Coming to Town does when Kris Kringle gets married, and when Linus reads the Christmas story at the end of A Charlie Brown Christmas.  Very refreshing!  There is also a wonderful song that features characters called ""selves"" who are the opposite of elves--and these ""selves"" are the selfish workers who work for the evil Crad, the bad guy who, when the movie begins, has been trying to take away Christmas for many years--until, of course, the cute little characters in this movie ""save the day!!"" In short, while it is a bit slow in parts, the characters are darling and funny, the message is right on the  money and the colorful design of the film's backgrounds and characters is uplifting and inspiring.

An all-star cast including Norm MacDonald and Brad Garrett as hilarious fox and polar bear con artists, and memorable songs sung by award-winners Shirley Jones, Kathy Bates and Andy Griffith, it's now a perennial favorite for my family and a great gift to give.

3544631,5,B001DZOD0E,This film is truly a joy to watch.  How refreshing it is to see that someone is not afraid to show what Christmas is all about.  Giving and not taking.  Thank you for making a movie I want to watch with my kids,1260057600,5,210,3.8372093023255816
3544632,2,B001DZOD0E,"I'm only giving it 2 stars because I like the retro animation.  Most of this movie is dark and depressing - starts out with kids bullying a girl with a cane, spends way too much time in an awful orphanage, eventually moves to the underground place where the bad guy lives.  No catchy music.  Didn't like it!",1259280000,3,307,4.350877192982456
3544633,1,B001DZOD0E,"I just watched this film and thank goodness I purchased it from the thrift store.  I don't understand all the good reviews on here.  Yes it ties in the real meaning of Christmas, and that is a refreshing change, but the singing is AWFUL throughout.  The heroine has a cane that she obviously doesn't need.  Just because it mentions Jesus doesn't make it a wonderful film.  I LIKE that it mentions Jesus, but it's so difficult to listen to the singing and to watch the heroine, Sophiana, run with her cane never limping.  It was awful.  UGH.",1256860800,,540,4.505154639175258
3544634,5,B001DZOD0E,My family and I watched this wonderful movie on Christmas Eve and laughed the whole way through. I didn't know what to expect but was entertained through the entire film. The music and characters were amazing and the story was excellent and heart warming.  I'm thankful for films like these that adults and kids alike can enjoy TOGETHER! I highly recommend this wonderful delight!,1230163200,2,380,4.9375
3544635,5,B001DZOD0E,"I liked it.  It's a nice little family movie with some good ideas (I admit I'm not exactly a Christian, but the idea of Santa's sack being made out of Jesus' birth clothes is quite a cool concept to me), nice animation, and some fun songs.

It's cheap so you owe it to yourself to buy it for the kids as a new holiday film to enjoy.",1229472000,3,332,3.9402985074626864

3544637,1,B001DZOD0E,"Thought this would be a good holiday movie to watch with the family so I rented it.  Glad I did because this movie is lame.  Basically Santa's magic toy ""sack"" has been stolen by some evil villain that hate's Christmas so Santa is cancelling the holiday.  A young girl and a couple other characters set out to find Santa's sack and save xmas.  There were three main things I REALLY disliked about this movie:

1)The Music.  If I was a music teacher and this was what my class produced, F- for everyone.  The songs are not catchy at all and seem like they were made up as the people went along.  Not to mention all of them sound the same: background orchestra music with person ""singing"" in almost a talking voice. Lastly, the songs drag on (and I mean draaaaaaaaag) for several minutes.  At the end of each one came a sigh of relief that it was over.  I'd rather be punched in the ear by someone wearing brass knuckles than have to sit through another verse of music from this movie.  Seriously.

2) The story behind Santa's sack.  I give some credit for creativity but I can see how many would find it disturbing that his sack was made from the blankets baby Jesus was wrapped up in at birth.  I hope they washed that thing.

3) And finally, what I have the biggest problem with is the antagonist.  This movie goes way above and beyond at casting the devilish creature that stole Santa's sack as evil.  My daughter is 4 years old and wanted to turn the movie off at those parts because it was too scary.  She normally watches Scooby Doo and similar cartoons so she can handle some ghosts and basic kid hauted house stuff no problem.  However, this character is downright evil and had me questioning if I even approved of her watching.",1228867200,9,1735,4.39937106918239
3544638,5,B001DZOD0E,"I bought this movie a couple of weeks ago for my six year old, and we've seen it at least seven times!  My daughter loves it, and, frankly, I love it too.  It's the kind of movie reminiscent of ""Charlie Brown's Christmas,"" where finally the true meaning of Christmas is high lighted.  Also, there's another really neat twist to Santa's relationship with the Christ child, and I was so touched. The songs are really wonderful, and the actors doing the voices are great. It's a star cast.  The animation is terrific, too. It's really a sweet and funny Christmas classic, and I have no doubt that we will be watching it several more times before Christmas!  I came to Amazon because I was just about to order copies for the cousins for Christmas and thought I'd write this review. In this world of political correctness, what a joy to find a children's movie that celebrates the real meaning of Christmas. I encourage you to purchase this movie and add it to your Christmas collection. The children in your life will love it.",1228780800,4,1022,4.593406593406593

8295685,1,B001DZOD0E,"Where to begin.

Bad animation and terrible music/songs, but we'll come to that in a second.

This film seems to be deliberately conjuring up a version of the 1950's I for one am glad we left behind. For starters, everyone is white--and I mean EVERYONE. Oh, apart from the demonic bad guy who is black, natch. The main character lives in a Dickensian orphanage, filled with rosy cheeked (white) kids who dream exclusively of Christian nuclear families. The 'you can be anything when you grow up' sequence involves tiny boys expressing their desire to be police officers, astronauts and accountants, the main character saying she wants to be a cook and one other token girl saying she wants to be a mommy. The bad guy is literally a cartoon satan  -- a terrifyingly drawn embodiment of pure evil (per his awful song) who enslaves naughty children in underground fire pits.
And - to cap it all - the plot turns on santa's magical sack which, it turns out, is made from Jesus' swaddling clothes. I am not making this up. Jesus's swaddling clothes were made into a sack that magically fills with presents exclusively for --apparently -- white Christian children in developed nations. Who knew.

Reading positive reviews on here, I see a lot of them reflect either 2 year olds who love this garbage, or grandparents evoking nostalgia for their childhood. I put it you that 2-year olds will watch almost anything and don't know any better. And nostalgic grandparents...well, I think we all know what was really going on under that whitewashed past.

A footnote on the poor artistry...interesting retro visual style, but so clearly cutting corners & costs on the animation itself. Absolutely AWFUL music and lyrics that sound like they were written by a committee of 5 year olds. Competently phoned-in voice performances from the big actors, though I cant fathom why they allowed their names to be associated with this dross.",1494460800,,1918,4.871165644171779

8295687,3,B001DZOD0E,"I wouldn't let little kids watch this movie because the evil character is pretty scary looking, and it might scare them, but for older kids it would be ok, This wouldn't be something that I would watch again, once was enough for me.",1485734400,,232,4.4186046511627906

Aside from Santa and the creepy villain other reviews mention, the main character is a crippled orphan girl. There are bits that sort of explain Christmas and explain Jesus's birth but it kind of an awkward way. I guess they didn't want to make it too ""Christian"". The animation is wonderful but I'm disappointed that the writing and plot did not follow suit. My 4 year old didn't like it.",1481846400,,526,4.489583333333333
