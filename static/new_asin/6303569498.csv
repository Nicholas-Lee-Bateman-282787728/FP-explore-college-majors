I came across this one and got it for him as an early father's day gift. We just finished watching it, and we were not disappointed in the humor! Mr. Hurley is a very funny man, and his humor is appropriate for any age. He finds such delight in everyday happenings and can add a funny spin onto life's situations. The only problem I had is that the tape, at first, did not want to play. It kept going high-speed without any sound. After finally holding down the play and tracking buttons simultaneously, I got it to work, and we only missed the first three minutes. After rewinding when done, I was able to play the very beginning. I'm glad it worked because it was worth every moment!!!",1522540800,,828,4.280254777070064
