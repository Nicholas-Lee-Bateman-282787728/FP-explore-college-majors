8324141,5,630192102X,"A great Mark Twain's classic. Tom Sawyer has been always an inspiration for several generations. Tom is a smart adventurous boy who doesn't believe in conventional life styles. He's a rebel, a lover and a dreamer.

Unlike ""today's cartoons"", Tom Sawyer is a realistic approach to cartooning. It reflects simple life with its beautiful details. No speed visual effects, super flying heroes, exaggerated drama, or artificial flavors.... just beautiful reality.",1220054400,,458,5.542857142857143
