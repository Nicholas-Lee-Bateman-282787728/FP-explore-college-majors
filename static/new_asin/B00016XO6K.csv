1975352,5,B00016XO6K,"I was surprised to see how completely captivating and intriguing this film was.  If art imitates life then this film is a perfect example. In this documentary, director Jamie Meltzer explores the bizarre and fascinating world of ""Song Poems"".  In this obscure sub-culture, ordinary people with stars in their eyes are seduced by ads in the back of magazines promising fame and fortune for original songs.  For a price anyone can submit his or her personal, heartfelt, and often times very bizarre lyrics/poems to be recorded as songs. Yes, the subject matter is strange but I found myself touched by these people lives and completely fascinated by the inner workings of the business end of the song-poem world. What I loved about it was that it was so completely human. There should be more films made like this one. You don't need huge special effects or some grand subject matter, all you need is a good story.",1074556800,3,912,4.796178343949045

1975354,5,B00016XO6K,"It was about midnight in a hotel room on a business trip that I was flipping channels and came across this documentary and was immediately sucked in. It's just a fascinating story about an off-beat topic that most people have never heard about. I was so fascinated by it that I researched the PBS site until I found the producers name and contacted him to see when it would be on DVD (I never do that!).
Well, that was about a year ago, here it is, and I can't wait to see it with all the extras. If you are a fan of oddball documentaries in the vein of 'American Movie', 'The Checker King', or 'Cane Toads', then this one is for you.",1074124800,11,634,4.162601626016261
1975355,5,B00016XO6K,"I have watched a huge amount of television in my life.
That said, the PBS airing of Off the Charts was the funniest thing that I have ever seen on TV.  I am very excited to watch it again and even MORE excited to see the extras and hear the commentators.
I bought three so that I can lend the extras to friends and family.  I guarantee that I will be a hero.",1074124800,3,358,3.8904109589041096
1975356,5,B00016XO6K,"The previous reviewers are right on many counts: this film is similar in tone to ""American Movie,"" in that we are moved to laugh at, not with, the subjects; the ""poets"" are uniformly eccentric; it is often very difficult to watch; it is often hilarious. However, I think some reviewers missed the genuine pathos this film provides. First of all, many of these people are very, very happy with the song they paid for. Second, though the musicians did often knock out songs in less than an hour, they took their work seriously, often comically so. So, in the end, we have poets paying money time after time to have their poems turned into songs they are happy with. Then, we have musicians getting paid to write music that they take fairly seriously. What's the harm in that? The true pathos in the film, though, comes when we find out one of the song-poem collecters, whom we assumed the whole time viewed the song-poem phenomenon ironically, had a genuine, sweet and ultimately sad connection with the business. In the end, this film is funny and sad, difficult to watch, due to the poets' lack of awareness of their complete self-delusion. But I think everyone in the film would feel, after watching it, that they were treated fairly; thus, I believe, unlike previous reviewers, that this film was not an exercise in exploitation. In fact, I felt sorrier for the musicians, who realize how they are prostituting their talents, than I did for the poets, who were still keeping the dream alive.",1231632000,,1493,4.724137931034483

Around the film's mid-point, I felt emotionally conflicted. I searched the room for my cue. One man was folded-in on himself, looking wretchedly depressed. One was nonchalantly eating pistachios. Still, my own friend was laughing hysterically. What to think?

Personally, I find this documentary bizarrely poignant. Voiceless members of society find a means of expressing themselves (but they have to pay someone to speak for them ... ergggg). See the problem? For instance: while everyone will find Caglar Juan Singletary fascinating, some will view him him pity ... others might find him an uninhibited genius (as Priscilla Presley may). His fascination will ""historical honeys"" and firearms clearly concerns his grandmother (oooOooOoo, just wait for it). And, yet, I desperately want to find this man and make him my best friend ... very&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wesley-Willis/dp/B0000DEQLZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wesley Willis</a>&nbsp;(R.I.P., my man).

The construction of this documentary is rather brilliant. It moves from a playful surface read (looking at the stacks of submissions received from mental-hospital patients) to a more personal, deeper exploration. In one instance, the son of a song-poem recorder reveals the only way he knows his (now deceased) father is through his recordings. It is strangely touching.

While this film certainly amuses its audience (between the impassioned performance of ""Ginseng Digger,"" Ramsey Kearney's Black-Forest name-plate, and the menagerie of exotic animals, this film never fails to elicit a laugh!!!!), it also has a tender side. Even as Gary Forney (Iowa Mountain Tour) mutters something about a ""Chicken Insurrection,"" my hearts breaks for him. His quiet vulnerability leaves the viewer stunned. There is an endearing quality ... something about chasing dreams even if your dreams include rebel chickens (no matter).

You need not have any interest in the recording industry to enjoy this work ... this piece is much more about fringe-society and how ""vanity records"" may actually have a place in our world. And, I must admit ... I have LITERALLY found myself singing ""Jimmy Carter Says Yes!"" Once you hear it, you can't ""unhear"" it, my friend.

Brilliant stuff. Watch it.",1218326400,3,2521,6.070224719101123

1975359,4,B00016XO6K,"I am on a list that has been raving about this film- so I bought it even though I didn;t think it would be the kind of movie I would like.

They were right, I was wrong.

This movie is awesome- and the main reason is C-A-G-L-A-R!  His songs are very cool- and he is very cool too.  I didn't much like the rest of the song poets, however I liked all the guys who wrote and sang the music.

I don't know what all the hoopla is over Gene Marino.  I think it's admirable he put such effort into these little songpoems.  He sure didn't have too.

There is also not much I can say about Garry Forney.  He kind of exemplifies why people like me had such a bad impression of the industry and why I didn't think I'd like it.  [...]

But I guess the ends justify the means, because I really like this movie.  Especially you know who!",1124236800,,823,4.012345679012346
1975360,5,B00016XO6K,"Have you ever heard of Caglar Juan Singletary (the man behind the song `Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers')?  No?  How about Nilson V. Ortiz (The Thing), or Gary Forney (Chicken Insurrection)?  Probably not...should you know these individuals?  Not unless you're kin...so why am I bringing them up?  Well, I think many of us have seen the tiny, little ads in magazines (usually in the back), tabloids, or comic books that entice readers to send in poems and have them translated into songs, with the inference of possibly entering the music business and/or reaping the accompanying rewards (be they in the form of recognition or financial, or both) only to dismiss them as scams and wonder just what kind of people fall for such foolishness?  Well, the three I mentioned earlier are individuals who responded to such ads at one point or another, and have all had their words transmogrified into songs, for better or for worse...

In the documentary Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story (2003), Jamie Meltzer allows us a glimpse behind those ads I mentioned previously, detailing not only those with aspirations of having their words transformed into songs, but also those craftsmen who take on the responsibility turning someone's dreams into a vinyl reality, for a price, of course...as the film begins, Meltzer examines this rather extensive subculture, focusing on a relatively small, eclectic group within the whole, specifically the more inspired (or demented, depending on your view) elements.  How it actually works is you would send in your poem to the advertisement listed, and they would respond telling you they will take your poem and turn it into a professionally produced song, complete with singer and musical accompaniment.  All you have to do is send in some cash...and it's usually not a meager sum, but then what price can you put on stardom?  Once the cash was received, the work would begin, and a record produced, with a copy of going back to you.

While watching this documentary, I think what surprised me most was seeing the level of professionalism and seriousness displayed by the individuals or companies who turn these submissions into music.  They weren't especially high tech, and usually worked alone out of their homes, but they didn't appear to be in the business of scamming or fleecing these people of their money (although I'm sure some are).  They truly seemed interested in providing what they advertised, despite the quality of the material they often received, and believe me, there is a level of awfulness that goes beyond comprehension (this seems sort of an absurd aspect, to have accomplished musicians work with generally such amateurish material).  There was a very creepy element about some of these individuals who submitted their works, but you won't be able to deny the sincerity in their desires.  They didn't appear to have delusions about stardom, but only wished to hear their words in a format that could be enjoyed by others...and as creepy as some of these people may seem, they really can't compare to those who actually collect this material, those who scrounge, scavenge, and pontificate the virtues of said music...these guys probably scared me the most (probably because I could identify with them more than anyone else in the film).  I think the part I liked the most was when we saw, in a split screen, the artist performing a song, and the person who wrote the poem hearing the song for the first time.  It's funny how these original writers react to hearing the songs created from their words, especially when they get something not quite what they expected.  The film closes with one individual, now that he has his words translated into to music, deciding it's time to take his music to the people, and he and his son go on tour (all of one stop...you gotta start somewhere).

The actual documentary lasts about an hour, and the rest is made up of a plethora of special features including a director and producer commentary track, Sunburst Studio sessions (featuring the recording of six songs), deleted scenes (7 in all), a feature called the Iowa Mountain Tour, Live!, `Off the Charts' premiere party, Columbine Records Presents `America Sing!'(a variety TV show featuring a number of songs), and a song-poem advertisement gallery with commentary.  If you enjoy this, I would also recommend the book/CD combo Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music (I think someone already mentioned it), and another film titled Driver 23/Atlas Moth (2002), which doesn't so much pertain to `outsider' music, but is a great film about one mans dedication to his craft and the lengths to which he goes through in following his dreams.

1975361,5,B00016XO6K,"This is one of my favorite documentaries of all time. I have been a fan of song-poems for years, and this movie is the best explanation and analysis of the phenomena that I have ever seen. This film chronicles the important characters in American song-poem history, such as Rodd Keith and Ramsey Kearney (singer of perhaps the most famous of all song-poems, which he graciously apologizes for...), and such technical details as the functioning of the Mellotron and overdubbing techniques.

I have read the book ""Songs in the Key of Z"" (and highly recommend it), but this film best captures not only the humorous qualities of this musical genre, but also the human side of these aspiring songwriters. It's easy to laugh at a song like ""Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers,"" ""I am a Ginseng Digger,"" or ""Chicken Insurrection,"" but when you see the people who labored over these misdirected masterpieces, it definitely makes you empathetic to their plight. Particularly brilliant in this film are the interview segments, which highlight these songwriters and the people who actually make the music. Be sure to watch the film with commentary off and then once again with it on to get some additional insight from the filmmakers, and whatever you do, make sure you watch the extras to see the entire live set by the Iowa Mountain Tour (as painful as this may to be), and the discussion of the song-poem classic ""The Moon Men,"" a song with perhaps the most complex yet unfathomable rhyme scheme and meter of any song ever recorded.

This is a wonderful film, and I absolutely recommend it to any audience: it is captivating, humanizing, and uplifting to see the human spirit of these people struggle against obscurity.",1101686400,2,1707,4.923611111111111
1975362,5,B00016XO6K,"Saw this film before NRBQ took the stage at a Brookln venue called North Six for what was billed as 'NRBQ and the song poem experiment'. I had no idea what to expect.....Brilliant!  Had to buy a copy immediately. If your a songwriter you need to watch this. The band did a couple of tunes from the film as well( nice work on 'Richard Nixon"" PJ). Funny as hell, touching and sometimes painful to watch this doc is well worth owning if just for the 'America Sings' program found in the DVD extras.  Who are these people?!",1077321600,3,519,4.34020618556701
1975363,5,B00016XO6K,"As with most of the other reviewers, I first caught this on PBS several months ago.
When I found out it was finally on DVD I happily bought it and am not disappointed.
The wonderful stories told during this documentary are quite charming and actually very inspiring. Anyone interested in any aspect of music will adore this DVD...has many nice extras. Song-poems RULE!",1077148800,3,368,4.857142857142857
1975364,5,B00016XO6K,"Truly amazing.  I caught the last half of this on PBS & was hooked.  You kinda feel sorry for some of the ""talent"" on this disc.  Too bad Simon from American Idol wasn't on hand.  Some great music & some really bad ones.  But the stories of the artist involved are whats worth watching.",1076976000,3,286,4.222222222222222
1975365,4,B00016XO6K,"I, too, saw this doc last year and absolutely loved it.
I've always had a love for bad, cheesy music.  I can't explain why but things like The Shaggs and Portsmouth Sinfonia
and Mrs. Miller have always made the laugh. If you're the type that's bought a bargain basement album because it looks SO BAD, then you'll love this documentary. What's touching is how earnest and endearing a couple of these
song-writers were. Others were just plain strange. Such is the world of song-poems. The companies cranking this stuff out (actually decent musicians) made sure never to change the lyrics, no matter how bad or how poorly they worked.
So of course I loved this doc and it made me want to hear these songs for myself. For anyone that's curious, check out the website aspma.com. (American Song Poem Music Assoc.). It has a treasure-trove of song-poems available for download. There's also a couple of cds you can buy through Amazon that are great. Co-workers and I have laughed ourselves silly over some of this stuff. (sample song-poem lyrics: Disco, disco, disco ... I am going to Mt. Cisco. I am going to buy Crisco to bake a cake so I can disco, disco, disco. Also loved: Norman Casserly, the first male midwife) Highly recommended if you like unintentionally funny things...",1074988800,5,1274,4.764705882352941
8007408,5,B00016XO6K,Hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time.  You laugh at the songs until you see the people who wrote the lyrics and you start to feel a little guilty.

8007411,5,B00016XO6K,"This is a very well done documentary about a subculture most of us probably know little about.  I've seen those small ads in the backs of magazines about sending in one's poems to be set to music.  I had always seen it as just another money grabbing scheme in order to trick gullible individuals with stars in their eyes to part with their money in hopes of cashing in on their dreams.  This film shows us who some of those people are as well as an in depth look at those who put the poems to music.

We get to know the dreamers as well as the schemers, who are actually sincere in the dubious artistry of what they do.  A lot of the songs are pretty bad, at least upon first listening.  They became strangely compelling to me as I listened on and some of the songs I found to be enjoyable to listen to.

The editing of the film is very well coordinated as the interviews are cut back and forth to be interwoven into a coherent whole.  The interviews are entertaining, funny, and informative.  This is a film that gets to the heart of the hopes of the creative force of everyday people showing us that there are other people with their own dashed dreams who can all come together to produce something.  What the value of that something is on the greater face of things remains to be seen, but in the microcosmic realm of the song-poem industry there are fans and there are the creators of the stuff.

You need to see this film to get a fuller understanding of what I'm trying to express in my review.  This is not a big picture documentary about history, nature, or famous people.  This is a peek into lives of people we usually don't think about or even know about.  Or they could people like you know or even like you.

From now on when I see one of those ""poems set to music"" ads in a magazine, I'll have a very different realization of what this industry is about.",1415577600,,1868,4.252124645892351

It's not always clear what drives them to write music, and it's less clear what motivates them to send their lyrics off to session musicians who record songs with those lyrics, but their joy is undeniable and infectious.  If you've ever had a dream, these folks are your people.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed American Movie or any other story about underdog artists who persist in their craft despite a world of discouragement.  They may not always make something beautiful, but they very often become something beautiful in the process.",1395100800,,661,4.823008849557522
8007413,5,B00016XO6K,"Wow.  I was hanging out at somebody's house and heard the kung fu bicycle song, and never thought I'd know anymore about it apart from it just being another mad song-poem.  It's amazing to see the layers of schlock, hackiness and casual disregard that permeate the ""business"" somehow making the subject songwriters the most holy of artistic wanderers in contrast.

A fun film to watch.  A sadist may point and laugh, a masochist may see themselves, the ordinary viewer may just wonder at the spectacle, and thrill to the accidental art that is the result.",1382313600,,555,4.810526315789474
8007414,5,B00016XO6K,"Really and truly, don't bother renting this film. You will be doing yourself a horrendous disservice.

Buy it.

Buy it and watch it, and then watch it at least 7 more times over the course of the next year. That's what I did after first seeing ""Off the Charts"" as a streamable Netflix film last April.

I have since screened it for friends and family, all of whom have sat through it stunned and stupefied. Think Christopher Guest, but in association with the term ""documentary"" instead of ""mockumentary."" Think of every friend who has ever shown you an original poem and said, ""I put my whole heart into this,"" only to find, upon reading it, that your friend's heart is actually a landfill for all the poetic garbage in the world. Your friend's heart, in fact, is the poetic equivalent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

This is where all the insanely bad, yet insanely (brilliantly?) quotable songs go to die (live?).

""Off the Charts"" is only an hour long, but there are extras on the DVD. Those extras most definitely justify buying the DVD, as opposed to simply streaming it online.

Buy this film for yourself. And for the love of all that is holy, buy it for everyone you know who writes dreadful poetry. Put a big ""Hint Hint: This is You!"" sticker on the outside of the box, and don't hide your glee. After weeping inconsolably for 40 days and nights without properly hydrating and being hospitalized with an IV to maintain his/her body's fluid levels, your friend will thank you for the sublime wake-up call (and go right on writing criminally bad poetry).

8007416,3,B00016XO6K,"Off the Charts is an interesting documentary about people who dream of composing hit songs. For many years, companies have placed classified ads offering to create songs if people send in lyrics - and cash. Off the Charts focuses both on the would-be songwriters who send in lyrics and on the musicians who compose songs to go with the lyrics.

Though thousands of songs have been created this way through the years, none has ever become a hit. But the world is not short on people who will pay to chase their dreams. Off the Charts, then, is a film about dreamers who refuse to give up. The would-be songwriters in this film are a varied bunch. Two of the most memorable are:

- Gary Forney is an Iowa man whose songwriting dreams
inspire  him to call a disk jockey in Denmark from a payphone  and to undertake a ""tour"" that consists of one (shaky) concert. Gary's songs include ""Chicken Insurrection"" and ""Three-Eyed Boy.""
- New York's Caglar Singletary is a unique man whose songs combine his love for kung fu, Annie Oakley, guns, and Christianity - among many other things. Caglar's songs include ""Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers.""

The other side of the story is provided by the musicians and businesspeople who make money by turn the dreamers' lyrics into songs. The most-vivid character among the musicians is Gene Merlino (aka Gene Marshall). Merlino started out in the music industry in the 1950s and won a 1966 Grammy (beating out the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, among others). However, his career quickly fizzled and he ended up as ""The King of the Demo Singers."" The viewer feels Merlino's frustration and cynicism while watching Merlino berate his fellow musicians during a ""song-poem"" session.

In contrasting the dreaming songwriters and the cynical musicians, the filmmakers cause the viewer to reflect on the tensions between art and commerce. For those most part, however, the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions. Off the Charts is a nice, quirky slice of life that exposes viewers to a little-known subculture.",1295049600,,2046,4.881844380403458
8007417,4,B00016XO6K,"Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story (Jamie Meltzer, 2003)

It's a half-decent bet, especially if you grew up in the eighties, that if you're aware of the song-poem phenomenon, you came to it through a John Trubee song whose name I cannot reproduce on Amazon. But there is more to the song-poem story. Oh, there is a great deal more. And you can learn more about it than you ever wanted to in the essential documentary Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story.

The documentary alternately traces the history of song-poems (you know those ads in the backs of magazines telling you to send in your poem/lyrics and $250, and you'll get a professionally recorded song in return? Yeah, those), contains interviews with some of the genre's movers and shakers, both on the lyrical side and in the song mills that crank out song-poems, and show in-the-studio footage that is alternately hysterical and pathetic. Director Meltzer (Welcome to Nollywood) makes no pretensions towards objectivity here; he sees the basic absurdity of the whole industry, and his objective seems to be to show it, from the scary, dysfunctional people who send these poems to be recorded to the recording artists who see themselves as superior to the lyricists (but are just as nuts).

I call this ""essential"" because I think it will appeal not only to those who enjoy outsider music, but to just about anyone. People who enjoy the dysfunctional idiots who people reality TV will find a great deal to enjoy here. Those who enjoy the countrywide mediocrity of American Idol will love it. Those who just like a well-turned documentary will get a kick out of it. John Trubee fans will love his jaded take on things. Those who always root for the underdog will find new artists to champion. Really, there's something for everyone here. Find a copy of this and watch it; there's so much to be enjoyed here that it will be well worth your time and effort.
