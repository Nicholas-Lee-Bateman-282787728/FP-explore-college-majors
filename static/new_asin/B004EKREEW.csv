8427117,3,B004EKREEW,"The title ""Ghulam-E-Musthafa"" translates into ""slave of God,"" and this epic study of one man's inner struggle with his violent upbringing versus his devout religious beliefs, is truly something to behold. Musthafa, as a young street orphan, is adopted by a political crime boss, whom the boy calls Abba, or ""father."" The Muslim youth is trained to be a killer, and grows into a quiet, lonely man who knows little more than killing, and prayer. A volatile mix, and when a chance encounter with a beautiful nightclub dancer awakens human emotion in Musthafa, he is forced to re-think his life, and how Allah expects him to live. When a car bomb, planted by a rival crime family, takes the life of his woman, Musthafa takes it as a sign from God, and sets about changing his ways. But not before a deliriously stylish and violent revenge is carried out on the men who took the life of his beloved. As with many Bollywood films, ""Ghulam-e-Mustapha"" is rich with many different genres. Powerful drama, political espionage, and romance go hand in hand with comedy, brutal violence, and... musical numbers! However don't expect a light, sugar-coated film here; this is some serious stuff indeed, and the few music set pieces are cleverly integrated into the film without sacrificing authenticity; those segments are either nightclub performances or fantasy scenes, and the actors don't break out in song, rather the songs are there as a backdrop. The first portion of the film introduces us to the highly developed characters, and sets up the events to come. the second portion, when Musthafa moves into the home of a proud Hindu family, and the struggle that develops over religious beliefs and customs, is both fitfully funny and profoundly touching, and the final portion features some surprising violence, and a shocking ending that you will never forget. This one will be quite a discovery for fans of great, if obscure cinema, and it's topic of Islam is quite timely now. In fact 'Ghulam' serves as a beautiful example, and sheds light on the most misunderstood religion on Earth, by portraying a deeply sympathetic Muslim male, who has a profound love and respect for the lives of others, regardless of religion. In the tradition of DePalma's ""Scarface,"" ""Ghulam-e-Musthafa"" is an epic tale of violence, power, greed, and redemption.",1303084800,,2333,4.984615384615385
