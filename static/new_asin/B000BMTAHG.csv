That is not important, what is important is that this is an excellent movie and requires several viewings to appreciate. The sex scenes are not so offensive, and are actually necessary to understanding the movie (this is not always the case with American movies). Fans of Pane e Tulipani will already have enjoyed this movie as well. Please don't let the negative reviews put you off. This is quite enjoyable and well worth watching.",1443571200,,542,4.838709677419355
8089072,2,B000BMTAHG,"I watched this movie because the Director's previous offering of Bread and Tulip was so uplifting and funny.  The same actress returned this time as a bookshop owner who fall for a married man who was younger than she was.  Then, there's her younger brother who was an architect who suddenly was told that he was adopted.  That inherently brought him into a mid-life crisis.  The architect's wife happened to be a prominent celebrity pscyhologist on TV about relationship (akin to Dr Phil) and yet, her marriage to the architect was in a shamble.  Their child was constantly abused by the other class mates because he was short of self-esteem.  On the tangent, there's this haute coutere who's also a clothes salesman that went from one place to the other to sell his stuff and sleeping with various women too.  He's also got a handicapped wife at home working on the phone.  Somehow, all their lives collided.  The title, the Storm was based upon the main character (Agatha)'s special ability to blow off the light bulbs when she felt something strongly.  What bothered me about this movie was that it was never sure whether it should be a drama or a comedy.  Yes, there's this comedy sketch about the architect and his favourite chicken laying egg on him but it didn't seem to add anything to this movie.  Yes, perhaps it's true that the movie was made with sincerity and that in the end, they remained close to one another and that life moved on but was that all to it?  It's one of those movies that got yourself asking, was that it in the end.  I really couldn't find a cohesive theme to ""Agatha and The Storm"" but simply going through the motion of watching it.  Perhaps, other reviewers in the future would enlighten me with something that I had missed.",1144108800,2,1760,4.596153846153846
