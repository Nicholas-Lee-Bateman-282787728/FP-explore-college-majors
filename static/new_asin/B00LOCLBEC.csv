6495752,3,B00LOCLBEC,"Tag Team Champions The Usos vs. Goldust & Stardust - Jey came into this match with a bad leg that had been injured & attacked by the Rhodes for weeks leading into the match as the Usos took control early with some double teaming to the point where it took a distraction from the referee for the Rhodes to regain the advantage making frequent tags & focusing on one member of the opposition to the point where when he was able to start getting some offense on one man that his partner was able to cut him off right away while continuing to take advantage of distractions by the referee as both teams traded momentum with high impact offense & both teams flying onto each other while The Usos attempted to the Rhodes a taste of their own medicine from previous weeks.  A very good athletic back & forth tag team match.

United States Champion Sheamus vs. Cesaro - Cesaro attempted to out-wrestle Sheamus early to no avail causing him to show frustration which only fired up Sheamus responding with strong blows only for Cesaro to match the trading fist to the point where both men spilled over the top at one point & continued to fight on the floor as both men traded momentum with strong physical offense such as an uppercut that sent his opponent off the top to the floor & one man's momentum stopped dead in it's tracks with a clothesline that J.B.L. really appreciated on commentary as they continued to use their strength to not only pound on each other but also kept powering out & kicking out of each other's trademark offense that normally results in a victory as it really just came down to one man being able to catch the other man in what was just a really physical back & forth fight but a step below their previous PPV match months earlier at Payback.

Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. The Miz - Country music group Flordia-Georgia Line were on commentary for this match while both Dolph & Miz had their R-Truth & Damien Sandow in their corners as both men were evenly matched early on having counters & escapes for their opponent's offense or hitting big moves such as repeated elbow drops or big boots to the face as Miz would gain the advantage while being a ""show off"" himself while Dolph got aggressive taking the match to the floor on one occasion while more than just the ""stunt doubles"" getting involved at ringside.  This match was like one of the old WCW crusierweight matches where there was good action in the ring but the focus on commentary & parts of the match was on other things but the action itself as their matches the next night on RAW & previously at SummerSlam were better.

Right around here was when Seth Rollins issued an open challenge due to Roman Reigns emergency surgery days earlier leading to the return of Dean Ambrose with J.B.L. giving the comedic line, ""he didn't pay his cab fare"" in what was an entertaining brawl around ringside & in the crowd.

Mark Henry vs. Rusev - Lillian Garcia sang the national anthem while Mark wore new patriotic ring gear given to him earlier in the night as Henry was dominate pounding Rusev down sending him out to the ring constantly before Rusev was able to drive Henry's back into the steel steps which heavily effected him throughout the match to the point where he was hurting himself delivering his own offense while Rusev took advantage of the situation he created in a match that was about as good as it could be but definitely told a great in-ring story.

Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.

Divas Champion Paige vs. A.J. Lee vs. Nikki Bella - Normally I don't comment on these things but I think the pre-match package was the best one I can remember on a divas match seeing as it was the buildup to this match through the eyes & words of the champion Paige.  Each divas came into the match attempting to use the same strategy of divide & conquer sending one diva outside of the ring to solely focus on the other while having some interaction between all three divas on the outside as Paige & A.J. continued to play their ""frienemy"" mind games with each other with Nikki even showcasing some strength of her own in a solid match.

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena - WWE did another good video package that caught my attention before this match but in this case was a bell to bell breakdown of the numbers involved in their previous SummerSlam match.  Cena attempted to give Brock a taste of his own medicine from SummerSlam in the opening minute while Brock heavily focused on the midsection using the same strategy from SummerSlam with various suplexes along with using his trademark kimura armlock submission stopping Cena dead in his tracks whenever he started to gain momentum only for Cena to ""never give up"" to the point where he was able to get some hard blows in to the point where Brock was bleeding from the nose as both men did go back & forth hitting their impactful moves along with sequences of countering or powering out their opponents.  This was definitely a more competitive match than SummerSlam with the only downfall being the finish...depending on how you want to look at it.

There was no pre-show match but instead the return of Christian's talk show ""The Peep Show"" with Chris Jericho as a guest along with a cameo from Randy Orton.  In the end, this was a solid PPV event as there wasn't a bad match on here but not the best encounters between some of the opponents but overall still an event I would check out.",1412121600,,6257,4.5452930728241565
6495753,3,B00LOCLBEC,"Tag Team Championship: The Usos vs. Goldust and Stardust
This was a fun match, with so many near falls and dust twins are crazy. At the end goldust and stardust become new champs. 3/5

U.S Championship: Sheamus vs. Cesaro
This was a hard hitting match, with so many counters. Cesaro looked like a beast out there but at the end sheamus won. 3/5

I.C Championship: Dolph Ziggler vs. The Miz
This was a match that could of been better but the dumb commentary prevented it. But this fued is really good and the match was fun. The Miz wins which sucks but he is a great heel. 3/5

Seth Rollins/ Ambrose segment
This was great, ambrose came out and looked like a beast. This feud is the best all year.

Rusev vs. Mark Henry
This was okay but boring at the same time. Rusev is looking dominant. 2/5

Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton
Best match of the night. It was back and forth, also what a cool ending. 4/5

What a good divas match, with some cool spots. AJ won out of nowhere. 3/5

6495754,4,B00LOCLBEC,The Tag Team title match between The Usos (Jimmy & Jey) against Goldust & Stardust was a hot opener to say the most. The United States title match between Sheamus & Cesaro flet like a G-1 bout and a good one at that. The Intercontinental title match between Dolph Ziggler & The Miz was disappointing this side of WCW. The Mark Henry-Rusev match was boring as watching paint dry. The Randy Orton-Chris Jericho match was a classic despite the lack fo story going into it. The AJ Lee-Paige-Nikki Bella-3 Way-Divas title match was also pretty boring too. The WWE Worlds title match between John Cena & Brock Lensar was very good and much more competitve then thier Summerslam bout even with the DQ ending. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.,1411344000,,732,4.511278195488722
6495755,3,B00LOCLBEC,"Usos vs Stardust and Goldust: The Dust brothers won after Stardust rolled up one of the Uso's.
  Cesao vs Sheamus: Cesaro has been wasted for months so no real surprise that Sheamus retained the U.S. title with the Brogue Kick.
  The Miz vs Dolph Ziggler (IC Title): The Miz is of course IC Champ again when they have no clue how to use Cesaro. Miz one with a roll-up.
  Reigns had surgery done, so Rollins of course demanded a count out victory. He then challenged anyone and Ambrose answered the call and they brawled all over until Triple H predictably had Ambrose arrested.
  Mark Henry vs Rusev: who will save America and WWE from Rusev ? Cena will..duh, so the commentators can say ""Thank You John Cena!"" So of course Rusev beat Henry with the camel clutch.
  Orton vs Jericho: Predictable since never let Jericho beat Orton. Solid match otherwise but Jericho should have won. Even the ending I saw coming when Jericho went on the top rope, was obvious he'd get caught with an RKO.
  Nikki Bella vs AJ vs Paige: AJ won the belt back with her submission finisher on Paige.
  Cena vs Lesnar (WWE Title): Cena predictably did better this time even if he seems to just have 2 moves of doom now instead of 5. Since he just did the AA and STF and throw punches throughout. Cena hit his 4th or 5th AA to almost win until Rollins hit Cena with the MITB briefcase to get the DQ.
  But thank god Cena didn't win to be the 16 time title reign. It took Flair 25 yrs and it's taken Cena only 10 yrs to beat it almost. It's a joke really. He's an entertainer like Ronald McDonald; not a wrestler.",1411344000,,1588,4.332203389830508
6495756,4,B00LOCLBEC,"1.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Usos (c) vs Goldust and Stardust

We start off with an awesome Tag Team title match bout. This was a fun match to watch. Both The Usos and the Dust brothers give forth an exciting showing with lots of close calls and back and forth action. Stardust reverses an attempted Superfly Splash from one of the Usos by bringing the knees up and takes advantage by rolling them up for the win and we have new Tag Team Champions! Really great and entertaining match to kick off the show! The Usos can pretty much work a great match with any team

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) WWE United States Championship Match: Cesaro vs Sheamus (c)

Fairly stiff match here. The pace starts seemed to shift back and forth from fast to slow before picking up again at the end. Cesaro stays in control for the most towards the end but in the same old, typical, overused fashion, Sheamus hits a Brogue Kick out of nowhere and retains the championship. Fair match but this was nothing more than yet another missed opportunity to put Cesaro over and let him shine

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWE Intercontinental Championship Match: The Miz w/Damien Mizdow vs Dolph Ziggler (c) w/""R-Ziggler""

Ziggler and Miz have a satisfying showdown for the Intercontinental Championship but unfortunately it was very hard to concentrate on the match with Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole, JBL, and Florida Georgia Line blatantly ignoring the match 99% of the time and instead advertising everything from the WWE Network to Florida Georgia Line's crapola music to Tribute To The Troops to even Mountain Dew if I remember correctly. In the end, Miz wins back the title after rolling Ziggler up and grabbing the tights for the 3 count

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Seth Rollins comes to the ring and gives Roman Reigns a 10 count to show up to fight him. Obviously Roman Reigns doesn't show up due to his injury he sustained over the weekend and Rollins declares himself the winner via forfeit. He then goes on to make an open challenge to anyone on the roster. The challenge is answered by a returning Dean Ambrose who storms the ring and beats Rollins post to post before being obtained by security

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Rusev vs Mark Henry

This is no different than all the other Rusev matches you've seen since his debut. The babyface gets pushed to the mountain top and when crunch time comes, they can't measure up. Henry was just the latest victim but for awhile seemed like he'd be the first person to crush Rusev. After working over Henry's back, Rusev puts in the Accolade and Henry taps out.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Randy Orton vs Chris Jericho

Nothing more than a filler match to allow Jericho one last match before taking a hiatus again. But shockingly, this filler match happened to be probably the match of the night. Orton and Jericho moved around at a great pace and kept me watching the match beginning to end. Jericho attempts a dive off the turnbuckle but Orton catches Jericho in mid-air with an amazing RKO for the win

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWE Triple Threat Diva's Championship Match: AJ Lee vs Nikki Bella vs Paige (c)

This actually turned out to be a solid and worthy Diva's Championship match. Nikki Bella pretty much played the wild card in this match. Speaking of Nikki Bella, she was extremely impressive in this match, which really surprised me. Using her strength, she pulled out the stops and manhandled both AJ and Paige with quite an arsenal of moves. In the end, AJ makes Paige tap to the Black Widow to capture her third Divas Championship. For a Triple Threat divas match, I was very satisfied with the outcome.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match: John Cena vs Brock Lesnar (c) w/Paul Heyman

In a rematch from their SummerSlam match, Cena and Lesnar go at it once more for the World Title. Unfortunately this match didn't live up to the hype like it should have. Lesnar and Cena use way too many of the same moves in this match for this one to even remotely be considered a classic. A shoulder block to the gut here; an AA there, a german suplex here; another AA there. This goes on for pretty much most of the match. Right as Cena hits the 4th AA on Lesnar, Seth Rollins interferes and attacks Cena. Rollins hits the Curb Stomp on Lesnar and attempts to cash-in on the fallen champion, but Cena stops him. Rollins escapes to the back and Lesnar basks in the spotlight as champion. Very WCW-esque ending to close the show

Overall: Not too bad of a PPV to say the least. Some matches delivered, while others didn't too much. Best match of the night was either the Tag Team Championship Match or Jericho vs Orton. Night of Champions wasn't a bad PPV but it was just decent enough to be acceptable of watching",1411257600,5,5355,5.4033613445378155

NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2014

Spoilers

1.[TAG TITLES]THE USOS VS GOLDUST & STARDUST-excellent opening bout between these two teams brothers. Great back and forth action that moves at a great pace with the champions controlling early only to be brought down by the challengers. The fans were really into this one as they should have been with all four men showing what they can do. Gold and Star end up taking the titles in a close battle that made both teams look good.

2.[US TITLE]SHEAMUS VS CESARO-we follow that last match with another great one that started out good but worked its way to great. The fans were into this one as well and were very much into Cesaro. Good brawling and power moves between the two as they battle it out over the U.S. title. Cesaro looks great in this match but still ends up coming up short after he eats a Brogue kick.

3.[I-C TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS THE MIZ-this is a better match than most people give it credit for. Good back and forth action between the two and some near falls. Also there is Mizdow and R-Ziggler at ringside and that just adds to the fun. Miz ends up stealing the victory here in a good match for the I-C title, see the next night on Raw for more on these two.

It was at this point that Seth Rollins was going to Face Roman Reigns before his injury. So Seth comes out and accepts his victory after a ten count and then challenges anyone to come out. At this point Dean Ambrose makes his way into the arena and attacks Seth and continues to do so until he is arrested.

4. RUSEV VS MARK HENRY-this was the big America versus Russia match that was continuing that storyline. After Lillian sings the National Anthem wonderfully as always we get into this battle of the big men. The fans were so behind Henry here as they have been for everyone that has faced the Russian. Typical match for Rusev but I still enjoyed it. In the end Rusev comes out on top once again after a pretty good match.

5. CHRIS JERICHO VS RANDY ORTON-this was a good with two guys that have produced some great matches. Both of these guys work well together and deliver with a really good match. Good pace and back and forth action that spills to the outside for some really good moments. Orton wins this one after catching Y2J with an RKO in mid air. Now taking nothing away from Randy but DDP was doing the same thing many years ago with the same move. Still a great moment but it seems nobody ever remembers that.

6.[DIVAS TITLE TRIPLE THREAT]PAIGE VS AJ VS NIKKI BELLA-now this was a good Divas match but to be honest Nikki was not needed here. Although I will say that she did a great job here in this match and was a good addition. But given the different storylines with the three here it was really about Paige and AJ which is why it made sense that AJ defeated Paige for the title here. Still a good match with all three doing a good job.

7.[WWE TITLE]BROCK LESNAR VS JOHN CENA-the main event of the evening was a rematch from SummerSlam. Now that first match would see Lesnar destroy Cena while here it was a little bit less than that. Still Lesnar really did control most of the match with Cena getting in moments until his big push at the end of the match. Both used their power moves to take the other out with Cena hitting four AAs and locking in the STF three times until Seth Rollins cost him the title by attacking him. so when Rollins went to cash in his MITB contract Cena stopped that.

Over all this was a good event with some really good matches on it. Not the best that they have produced but not the worst either. For special features we get the Peep Show with Y2J,  and interviews with AJ Lee and the Dust Brothers.",1417305600,3,3670,4.327510917030568
