8342005,5,B001TLWR6O,Tna put on a solid ppv with the 2009 Lockdown. From the solid x-division championship match to the average queen of the cage match to two phenominal tag team title matches to one of the best women's title matches in years to a brutal world championship match you are in for a bloody night of wrestling. If you are a wrestling fan check it out!,1418774400,,343,4.292307692307692
8342006,4,B001TLWR6O,"With the exception of ""Bound for Glory"" and ""Slammiversary"", ""Lockdown"" is TNA's premiere show, so it's only appropriate that they would manage to right the ship before this show and deliver a strong event for the first time since ""Slammiversary"" in 2008. Besides being a good wrestling show, the event was accentuated by the Philadelphia crowd that remained hot for the entire show.

One of my favorite things about this show is the focus on tag team wrestling in various match types; all the good matches on this show involve tag teams fighting against one and other in various stipulations. The IWGP Junior Tag Team Titles were contested in a brutal three team match with the Motor City Machine Guns, LAX, and No Limit where I'm surprised nobody was seriously injured; Beer Money and Team 3D tore the house down with their Street Fight that went all over the arena; and the Main Event Mafia/Frontline Lethal Lockdown delivered a great WarGames style match.

With all this good stuff going on, the TNA Title match between Sting and Mick Foley is kind of a come down. I'm a fan of both guys but neither of them are at the point where they should be expected to deliver a classic match. The result is a surprise; however, I would only recommend the match for curiosity sake.

The rest of the card is filled with solid if unspectacular matches like Abyss/Morgan in a Chamber of Blood match, a four way Queen of the Cage encounter and s three way Knockouts Title match. None of them are great, but I wouldn't say any of them were offensive either.

At one point, I said that 2009 was one of TNA's better years and, I have to admit, I had forgotten how sorry the first quarter of the year had been. Suffice to say the next few shows will go a long way towards improving the company's PPV output.",1411257600,,1792,4.538699690402477

8342009,4,B001TLWR6O,"The 5 way Xscape match for the X Division title was a high-flying showstealer and the same goes for the 3 way Tornado match for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team titles. The Queen Of The Cage match was a smash-mouth brawl and the same goes for the 3 way Women's title match. The Matt Morgan-Abyss-Doomsday Chamber of Blood match was a bloody,hard-hitting brawl. The Team 3D-Beer Money Inc-Philadelphia Streetfight for the TNA & IWGP World Tag Team titles was a smash-mouth,hard-hitting,out-of-control,brawl and the same goes for The Lethal Lockdown match. The Mick Foley-Sting-World title match was not great but pretty good and even a good reminder of a ECW match back in the 1990's. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1282003200,,718,4.798387096774194
8342010,3,B001TLWR6O,"X-Division Champion Suicide Vs. ""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal Vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir Vs. Consequences Creed Vs. Kiyoshi (Xscape Match) - Though not a bad choice for an opening bout, for a TNA X-Division Match it was pretty weak. For those who are used to the type of action the X-Division brings to their matches, you will be rather disappointed with this match. Definitely the weakest Xscape Match with the only spot that is noteworthy is the end. 2.75/5

O.D.B. Vs. Madison Rayne Vs. Daffney Vs. Sojo Bolt (Queen Of The Cage Match) - This was another weak match as it has nothing memborable or noteworthy at all. Just an average filler match. 1.75/5

I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Champions Motor City Machineguns Vs. No Limit Vs. Latin American Xchange - This is the first standout match of the night as all six men gave a good performance & gave solid, fast pace action all throughout the match with L.A.X. (particularly Hernandez) showing their dominance and overpowering the two smaller teams. The match has very good double team spots as all three teams worked extremely well with each other. Not necessarily a ""show stealing"" match but this match definitely help saved this PPV from going into the slumps. 3.75/5

Abyss Vs. Matt Morgan (Doomsday Chamber Of Blood Match) - The rules for this match is that an opponent must make their opposition bleed before he can score a pinfall or a submission. If you're expecting the same type of hardcore match seen from Abyss from the 2005 & 2006 days, you will be quite disappointed here. Not saying this match is horrible, the way this match was advertised it was pretty mediocre when these two should've tore each other to shreds. Matt Morgan mostly dominates the match while taking advantage of the hestitation by Abyss to not use weapons. Abyss' therapist ""Dr. Stevie"" appears and reveals himself as Stevie Richards at the end & costs Abyss the match. Where this match should've been the most brutal match of the night, it was rather weak & mediocre. 3/5

TNA Knockouts Champion Awesome Kong Vs. Taylor Wilde Vs. Angelina Love - I actually felt this Knockouts Title Match wasn't that good but its far from being the worst Knockouts Title Match. Angelina Love was the odd man out (or shall I say Woman) as Awesome Kong & Taylor Wilde were seeking revenge after recieving hair cuts from the Beautiful People. Awesome Kong displays in this match why she is the best Knockouts wrestler today in TNA as she dominated her two opponents & even getting aeril before being disposed of (in a unique & clever way I must say) by Angelina Love. The ending was quite weak as Angelina Love becomes the new Knockout Champions after being knocked loopy by a splash from Taylor Wilde. 2.25/5

TNA Tag Team Champions Beer Money Vs. I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions Team 3D (Philadelphia Street Fight Match) - As Bubba Ray said it, this match was for ""Tag Team Domination"" as the TNA Tag Team champs met the New Japan Tag Team champs with all the belts on the line. This match was set up by having the cage door remain open & pinfalls counted anywhere in the building. These two teams fought everywhere in this match from ringside, into the crowd, back to ringside, & in the ring with the match also having a couple of good spots involving D-Von being double suplexed through a table & Bubba Ray hitting a super Bubba Bomb to Robert Rude from the top rope that had to been devastating for Rude. This match had a big time title feel to it and it delivered. Match of the night. 4.75/5

Team Angle/Main Event Mafia: Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash, Booker T, & Scott Steiner Vs. Team Jarrett: Jeff Jarrett, Legends Champion A.J. Styles, Daniels, & Samoa Joe (Lethal Lockdown Match) - This Lockdown match has a lot of variables in it. First off though, if you aren't familiar with Lethal Lockdown rules, two men starts the match for a five minute time period and from there at every two minutes, individuals from each team alternates entering the match & once everyone from each team enters the match, a roof is lowered ontop of the cage with weapons suspending from the top to be used and from there a team can only win by pinfall or submission. This Lockdown match is filled with so many spots & moments such as Daniels & Kurt Angle starting the match, Scott Steiner being dominate and bringing back the Frankensteiner, the A.J. Styles & Daniels reunion, Samoa Joe talking to someone secretive before his arrival to the match, whose side is Jeff Jarrett's loyalty is to, A.J. Styles doing his yearly ""crash & burn"" stunt, & the former ex-ECW Heavyweight Champion Bobby Lashley making his debut in TNA. Just like previous Lethal Lockdown matches, this was very good and it delivered. 4/5

TNA Heavyweight Champion Sting Vs. Mick Foley - The rules were changed before the match started as not only could you win by pinfall or submission but you could also win by climbing over the top and escaping the cage with the cage door being locked. Mick Foley came out in his Cactus Jack alter ego and would cut himself open before the match even started. From there, Sting & Foley told a good story as Sting focused on the legs of Foley to make it harder for Mick to climb the over cage & forcing him to try new ways in escaping the cage such as Mick trying to squeeze himself through one of the small camera holes in the cage. Mick has a good showing too after going back to his hardcore ways with ""barbie"" making an appearence in the match as well. This isn't a match that will really blow you away but from a main event status, it delivered. Sting & Mick Foley did their hardest to put on a good main event and they did that. 4/5

Overall, Lockdown was a good show with a few matches not delivering like they were suppose to. This event is recommended.",1247184000,,5751,4.587548638132295
8342011,4,B001TLWR6O,"Xscape Match for X-division title with champion Suicide, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Sheik Adbul Bashir, and Kioshi: For an x-division match, this one is pretty weak.

O.D.B VS Daffney VS Sojo Bolt VS Madison Ranye: Skip

I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Champions Motor City Machine Guns VS L.A.X. VS No Limit: I enjoyed this match

Doomsday Chamber of Blood match Abyss VS Matt Morgan: This match was slow at points but had plenty of blood. Dr. Stevie comes to ringside and Tenay has a revelation that Dr. Stevie is really Stevie Richards. It's a small thing to complain about but anyway, I really enjoyed this one.

Awesome Kong VS Taylor Wilde VS Angelina Love: You know I don't watch women wrestling, so don't look for an opinion on this match up.

I.W.G.P Tag Team Champions Beer Money Inc VS Team 3-D: Despite the obvious out come of this match, it was a damn good match. It was a falls count anywhere match, so the cage wasn't really necessary. Still, a very good match overall and I enjoyed it. Team 3-D makes history with this win in the town that made them famous, Philadelphia.

Lethal Lockdown Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, and Daniels) VS Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Scott Steiner, Booker T, and Kevin Nash): This was a excellent match. I don't understand what AJ Styles did towards the end where he splashes the cage, falls thru, and lands on flat on his face. Jeff Jarrett hits Booker with a guitar as AJ covers and scores the win.

Bobby Lashley debuts and points to a laughing Kurt Angle. As I write this, TNA has yet to do anything with Lashley. I was never fan of Lashley and think he's a mix of Warrior and Ahmed Johnson.

Mick Foley VS Sting: Remember there awesome Fall's Count Anywhere match from WCW? That was a classic match. After doing the history of the feud and introductions, this was a seventeen minute match. Sting can still wrestle despite his age, not so much for Foley. The match was decent but not main event worthy as Foley kicks a camera man and Tenay acts shocked. He gets a barbwire bat as Sting avoids it, until he tries to escape and Foley nails him with the bat. The end saw the classic two men try to escape a cage but who will hit first? I'm no major Foley fan so this title change meant nothing to me. It's a shame TNA gave Foley a title run, when he didn't do a damn thing with it. This is why they do not get more fans, even though Foley has a strong fan following.

Overall, a great event. I remeber TNA did it right by building up this feuds and making this event feel speical. There were no real bad match-ups and it's a must see.",1245974400,,2591,4.392484342379959
8342012,3,B001TLWR6O,"Okay..
finally with the entrance of Mick Foley, TNA have a show I'll buy on  DVD and not  laugh at but with...
and they release it fullscreen?  Does TNA and hillbilly Jeff Jarrett figure their customers either don't have widescreen TVs  or  will call and complain about the ""black bars"" cutting  off  their picture from the pay phones in their trailer parks?
Whenever I catch the show on the tube its widescreen and HD..so  why the lowbudge DVD?

My review of the night is that its still a second class wrestling promotion however with the last half  hour being the Foley/Sting match and lead up that alone  is worth the 3  stars!

PS...the bonus match with steroided up Danny Partridge .er Bonaduce is hysterical...he bites the finger  of a fan and  allegedly punches  him before the bout (LOL) and then his ""match"" with Eric Young shows that even in this second class promotion the pre-televised matches  are  even WORSE than you can imagine  and the few fans yelling ""you suck"" are  correct! Maybe Shirly Jones and Susan Dey can wrestle in their next PPV promotion!

I'd rather see Dixie Carter in the ring than the plastic gals they call  ""Knockouts"" ...and maybe against needlenosed announcer Jeremy Borash ...and for real ....that would be worth watching!",1245628800,,1261,4.767441860465116
8342013,4,B001TLWR6O,"Xscape Match: X Division Champion Suicide vs. Jay Lethal vs. Consequences Creed vs. Sheik Adbul Bashir vs. Kioshi - To those that are used to the X division spotfest that have happened in this type of match in the past, you'll be disappointed here as this was just a solid opening match between all four men but definately the weakest Xscape match they've had with the only noteworthy moment happening at the end.

O.D.B. vs. Daffney vs. Sojo Bolt vs. Madison Rayne - Nothing really noteworthy here as this was just an average filler.

I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Champions Motor City Machine Guns vs. L.A.X. vs. No Limit - The first standout match of the night as these four really vibed off each other with L.A.X. (mainly Hernandez) really tossing the Gunz (mainly Sabin) into the cage so many times with either a shoulderblock or Border Toss to the point where you are suprized that he wasn't serious injured afterwards.  Again, first standout match of the night

Doomsday Chamber Of Blood Match: Abyss vs. Matt Morgan - For those who didn't see the first one (Victory Road '07), the rules for this match are that you have to make your opposition bleed before scoring a pinfall or submission.  This match was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as Morgan dominated a majority of the match while taking advantage of Abyss hesitation of using weapons at the advice of his therapist, Dr. Stevie, who made an appearence to reveal himself to be Stevie Richards to ""ECW"" chants from the crowd (they are in Philadelphia afterall).  Again, this was a ""put a storyline over"" match more than anything but was just very medicore as it should have been a hardcore war.

TNA Knockouts Champion Awesome Kong vs. Taylor Wilde vs. Angelina Love - Love was the odd man (or in this case WOMAN) out here as both Wilde & Kong were looking for revenge for the haircuts they recieved at the hands of the Beautiful People.  As usual Kong dominated most of the action here & even attempted an arial move that you have to see to believe from her & haven't seen out of a ""heavyweight"" since the WCW days of Vader.  Look out for the unique way Love took care of Kong along with the splash Wilde gives to Love that obiviously knocked her a little loopy but this was a good Knockouts Title match and the best one we've had in a while.

Street Fight Match: TNA Tag Team Champions Beer Money vs. I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions Team 3D - The tag line for this was ""Tag Team Domination"" as the best tag team in TNA met the best tag team of New Japan with all the belts on the line.  The way this street fight worked was that they would allow the cage door to remain open & pinfalls counted anywhere in the building.  This was my favorite match of the night as they brawled through the crowd, at ringside, in the ring, and even had some nice spots here like the Super Bubba Bomb off the top rope that was so impactful that Roode bounced off the mat from recieving it.  All I'll say about the ending is that it will bring back memories of the Freebird/Von Erich feud from World Class before Team 3D makes history in the town that made their careers.

Lethal Lockdown Match - Team Jarrett vs. Team Angle/Main Event Mafia: Jeff Jarrett, A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Daniels vs. Kurt Angle, Booker T, Scott Steiner, Kevin Nash - For those unfamiliar with what the rules to Lethal Lockdown is, they the same rules which the old WCW/NWA match of War Games where under.  One man from each team starts the match and after a period of time, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each time period, the teams alternate sending members in.  Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.  This Lockdown is full of various moments such as the initial Daniels vs. Angle showdown, Scott Steiner's domination including the top rope Frankensteiner (it's always a sight to see him do that), Samoa Joe talking to someone before making his entrance, A.J. Styles doing his yearly stunt from the top but this time ""crashing & burning"", the whole story of ""who's side is Jeff Jarrett on?"", and the aftermath featuring the TNA debut of ex-ECW Champion Bobby Lashley.  Just like the other Lethal Lockdowns, this was a very good match and the second best of the night behind the street fight.

TNA Champion Sting vs. Mick Foley - Before the match, there was a change to the rules in that you could also win this match by escaping the cage but only climbing over the cage & dropping to the floor as the cage door was locked. Foley came as his Cactus Jack persona and busted himself open before the match got started.  They told a good story here as Sting hurt Cactus' leg early on to the point where Mick had problems climbing out of the cage so his decision to have the cage door locked backfired so he tried different ways of escaping the cage...including trying to squeeze himself through one of the camera holes in the cage.  It wasn't a blowaway match but you can tell both men tried their hardest here as it was the best Sting match probably since Bound For Glory while Foley heavily made up for his lackluster performance at Genesis months earlier.  I'll give Sting & Foley credit here in that they did what Triple H & Randy Orton couldn't do at Mania in that eventhough their match didn't top the the previous two matches, they were able to follow it up and give it the best they could.

Preshow Match: Eric Young vs. Danny Bonaduche - This match happened on the preshow as this was strictly a comedy match but I'll give Danny more credit than any other recent celebrity appearence in wrestling (Mickey Rourke for example) as he took more punishment than some of the regular wrestlers/knockouts did by being tossed into the cage at least twice.  The match was short & served it's purpose with a cameo appearence from Rhino at the end (they had to get him on the show in the old ECW hometown somehow).  Now I'm not sure if they're going to include this match on the DVD but odds are they probably will.

In the end, Lockdown was easily the best TNA effort since Turning Point back in November as they only one matches here that doesn't have a replay value (Abyss/Morgan).  TNA played to their strengths in wrestling and left the other ""entertainment"" stuff to the side so this is a PPV I would recommend taking a look at.",1242604800,,6438,4.489726027397261
