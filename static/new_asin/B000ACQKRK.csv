8077883,1,B000ACQKRK,"This product seemed to have been slapped together one rainy afternoon while Mr. Southern was nursing a creative block, with whatever tools were within arms reach.

The DVD uses Internet Explorer to view the lessons.  Internet Explorer rejects playing lessons with a message that says the DVD poses a threat to the system (XP Home).

I don't doubt the author's capabilities with the Zbrush tools, but the execution and production of his tutorial struck me as home made at the kitchen table.",1184371200,,489,4.939024390243903
8077884,5,B000ACQKRK,"I'm fairly familiar with ZBrush, but I'm always looking for more.  I've seen things by Gnomon, Digital Tutors, and more.  I would agree that maybe he's not the best artist - he's plenty good enough, though.  First, he speaks understandably, and he has a sense of humor, and, unlike 99% of computer manuals, he just says, ""The color picker is like any color picker, we don't have to get into that.""  Thank you, thank you!!  Most importantly, he goes through each and every control and button, in enough detail to understand them - ALL details would take 5 DVDs, of course.  Not just the best ZBrush tutorial, but maybe the best tutorial of any kind I've seen.  The modeling demos are good, but more importantly (as is the plan), it lets you watch him put it all together - how everything works in the real world, and in context.",1148947200,2,827,4.510067114093959
8077885,3,B000ACQKRK,"Having recently acquired a copy of Zbrush 2, I needed somebody to sit down and explain to me where everything is. Thankfully, I found Glen Southern's DVD tutorial and read rave reviews about it. However, it isn't available anywhere in the UK (ironically where Glen belongs) and the result of buying from America was a massive cost of 40+ and took approx. one month to arrive. This drastically affected my impression of the DVD when it showed up and my expectations had skyrocketed.

Glen Does a great job of explaining Zbrush from the smallest of detail and eventually moves on to model a head from start to finish. He's not the greatest artist in the world, but he knows this program very well and that's all that matters to those buying the DVD.

What I didn't appreciate was the sloppy interface that the videos run from and the order they're presented. One vid' in particular was an actual mistake and was left there through neglect. This means that the viewer will sit through half and hour of footage that will be repeated in the next vid.

My advise to anybody in the UK thinking of buying this is to weigh up all your other options first, but if you don't mind paying more than double the original price and waiting for it, then you'll become a more proficient Zbrush user through it.",1142467200,,1292,4.560344827586207
8077886,3,B000ACQKRK,"The DVD is packed with a lot of information, but the problem is how the information is presented.  As a novice with ZBrush 2 it's very hard to follow Mr. Southern's tutorials.  Many times he performs tasks without explaining how he did it.",1142294400,,239,4.534883720930233
8077887,5,B000ACQKRK,"Glen Southern is my favorite Zbrush artist.  Before I ever bought Zbrush, I'd admire his paintings and wish I could come close to creating images like his.  Well, guess what?  With this DVD, I can!  Of course, I can't do what he does nearly as well as he does (can anyone?) but this DVD has shown me so many tricks and tips that there'll be absolutely nothing that I can't create in Zbrush once I've watched these demos a few times -- and practiced till I drop, of course.  If I can imagine it, I believe I'll be able to create it with Zbrush.  This DVD truly opens one's eyes to what a fabulously powerful and versatile program Zbrush really is.

I've never seen any product so thorough.  I think that's what impresses me the most about this DVD -- Mr. Southern covers every Zbrush graph, every tool, every icon -- nothing is a mystery after viewing this DVD.  I just can't make enough positive comments about this product, and I would urge anyone who has a desire to learn Zbrush -- buy this DVD!  Buy it, watch it, and keep your copy of Zbrush open so you can pause the DVD at intervals and practice what you've learned.

I have never been so pleased with any program as I am with Zbrush.  Actually, I've come to the conclusion that one could conquer the world with Zbrush and Photoshop.  :-)  I have also never been so pleased with any teaching tool as I am with Mr. Southern's DVD.  Both have truly opened my eyes to a wonderful new creative world.

8077888,5,B000ACQKRK,"This is all you'll want for christmas this year and next!

ZBrush appears to the novice as an extremly complicated program, but Glen Southern's training DVD takes the mystery out of all those buttons and sliders. Even if you're a proficient user, don't skip the in depth interface tutorials, because i can bet you there will be several things in there you never knew before.

Glen takes you through manipulating ZSpheres and skinning them to adding detail and depth with the numerous brushes. Then on to the last section where he models a zombie head from start to finished image. Just sit back and marvel at a true expert at work. You learn to create textures in Projection Master,how to make your own Alphas to add amazing detail to your models, to modify and save materials, and finally, lighing and rendering.

Whew! And when you've been through the 9.35 hrs  of this video,there's a further 12 freebie vids tucked away. What more could you ask for!

I would thoroughly recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to improve their skills in the mighty ZBrush. It clearly and simply lays it all out for you to easily take in.

I love it!

So go GET IT !!",1133913600,2,1150,4.580487804878048
8077889,5,B000ACQKRK,Glen Southern teaches Zbrush like no other.  This powerful tool is any artist's dream come true.  It is very obvious that Glen is a master at this program and his approach to teaching it aligns with the artistic viewpoint while still covering all the technical aspects.  Amaze yourself with what you can create with Zbrush by getting this DVD.  Excellent!,1128902400,,355,4.866666666666666
8077890,5,B000ACQKRK,"after you watch this dvd, you will have very powerful new modeling skills.  Zbrush works different than other 3d modelers, so study the videos provided here by an obvious expert at zbrush.  Over 8 hrs of all the ins-and-outs this program offers.  Those who use it, and use it well, make the best models out there period.  Other modeling experience does help alot with this though, but it may even be good if you are looking for a primary modeler to learn.  On this dvd you will be shown how 4 different fantasy creatures are made in zbrush, and before that you will learn all the tools + interface.  The main tutorial also shows how to paint materials+ textures in zbrush, which is similiar to deep paint or whatever.  All in all this dvd is of the highest quality instructions and it has helped make zbrush my new favorite program to use.  thank you glen, you are a fantastic sculptor.  If this dvd does not motivate you, then nothing will.",1128297600,,941,4.488235294117647
8077891,5,B000ACQKRK,"There is no doubt about it - ZBrush is revolutionary. It's ability to bring detailed organic creation to your artistic pipeline is unrivalled. But with revolution comes the need to adapt to new ways of thinking and doing things. Without a good guide you can get lost in ZBrush pretty fast.

This DVD takes you through the whole process,  from setting up the environment, demonstrating the 2D and 3D tools and techniques, and shows you how Glen goes about making his jaw dropping creations - getting you into good habits from the start.

It's a pleasure watching someone with this much talent at work, and to hear what the pro's are thinking and how they go about doing things is just as valuable as seeing how a specific tool works. It has definitely motivated me to improve my own skills.

Awesome stuff.. Thanks Glen",1122336000,3,818,4.659722222222222
8077892,4,B000ACQKRK,"This is a very in-depth DVD created by glen southern. The DVD I think goes into a lot of detail explaining almost every aspect of Zbrush 2.0. If you fell confused or don't understand how to do something or works something out or just getting started With Zbrush then I suggest u pick up this DVD. It helped me out with a lot of confusion and it contains FREE silo tutorial videos for those who are into silo.
