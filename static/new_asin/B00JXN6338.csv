is accurately titled.  It is not detailed guitar instruction, but rather guidance for advanced
playing and arranging.  His explanation of how he came up with his arrangement of ""Maria Elena""
makes a lot of sense to me.",1451865600,,309,5.019607843137255

I really didn`t know it was all about altered tunings. I am sure it is just my problem but for my money I will stick with Toby Walker or Happy Traum in the future!!",1411689600,,301,4.033333333333333
