8350015,4,B0023SJW3S,"I was looking for an exercise dvd that I could do in front of, if not with, my 3-year old daughter. I try to teach my daughter to be modest so I like that the women in this video are real women, dressed appropriately for exercise, but not exposing a lot of flesh. My daughter will jump in and exercise with me some times, and at other times she'll just play nearby, but at least I'm able to get a good workout.",1404950400,,410,4.012195121951219
8350016,4,B0023SJW3S,"I just purchased Strong Mamas, Fit Families and have been using it for several workouts. I am 7 months post baby #2. Aside from the sometimes awkward scripted commentary the workouts are challenging with variations such as adding weights or alternative positions. There is one workout focused on upper body, one on lower body and one that covers whole body. Plus there are bonus workouts. My almost 2 yr old loves to be with me while I workout and it is incredibly adorable to watch her try the moves. There are children in the video working out alongside and with the moms so she likes to imitate. It is great if you find yourself needing to incorporate your workout while you are at home with your children. I would recommend it to others and even gift it to girlfriends.",1365465600,4,773,4.568345323741007
8350017,5,B0023SJW3S,"Whether you are working out with your kids or alone, this video is a great workout. It incorporates strength training with cardio. There are five workouts. The first three are 23 minutes and focus on the upper body, the lower body and the full body, respectively.  The last two sections are each 5 minutes. One is for kids only and the second is a 5 minute intense workout. What is great about this video is that you can choose to do just one workout or a combination of several. I like to start and end with the 5 minute intense workout and do one of the 23 minute workouts in the middle. Usually after I finish one of my kids asks me to put on the kid's workout.",1240185600,4,664,4.1875
8350018,5,B0023SJW3S,"This video is terrific if you do the entire 60 minutes or if you do the 20 minute versions. It can be easily carried during travel /vacation and is fun for children(with instructions for Mom's),Mom's and Dad's of all ages--I am in my early 60's.",1238889600,4,245,4.466666666666667
8350019,5,B0023SJW3S,This is a fabulous workout.  I love how Colleen manages to incorporate infants and young children into an exercise session for parents.  It's a wonderful activity to exercise together and set a healthy example for our children.  I highly recommend this video to both new and experienced mothers.,1238544000,7,295,5.104166666666667
