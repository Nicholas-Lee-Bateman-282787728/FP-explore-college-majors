7162646,5,B00X7SIALI,I really like this excellent series.  Would definitely recommend buying it if you like stories about vampires.  Right up there with Twilight series.,1355011200,2,148,5.391304347826087
7162647,5,B00X7SIALI,"True Blood started as everyone saying you have to see this and me grudgingly taking Season 1 from a friend. I now own all the seasons, know each character by name with background story and am humbly awaiting the release of season five. Its addicting, dont' say I didn't warn you",1354233600,71,278,4.470588235294118
7162648,2,B00X7SIALI,"Oh, dear. Poor Sookie. After the great ending of the last season with Debbie blasting Tara, and in turn Sookie blowing Debbie's head off, I was so happy. It was going to guarantee that this season would A: Open with a moral dilemma for Sookie cold-bloodedly murdering someone, and B: Do away with the most annoying character this program has (Tara). And it was going to have Christopher Meloni, who stagnated far too long on SVU, to finally play a character that would allow him to have fun. Also, with Bill and Eric playing fugitive, that had some good character conflict set up immediately as well. This had all the earmarks of a very good start.

Alas, none of these things were to be.

The fact that I watched every episode of the season was something befuddling to me, because other than one of the episodes directed by Michael Lehmann, this was an even more confusing and increasingly frustrating season with just some flat-out ham-fisted story arcs.

The main arc of the season was a not-bold-at-all-but-trying-to-be satire of rising fundamentalism and political and religious division in the United States where the Vampire Council slowly start to convert to a more fundamentalist belief that humans are their food, and they should not try to integrate at all but rather feed and kill at will according to the teachings of The Vampiric Bible and Lilith, the god of all vampires. On the human side of the spectrum, you have human groups in Bon Temps going around killing vampires and assorted ""freaks"", promoting the superiority of humans in the world. And then there's Sookie caught in the middle of everything, as per usual.

There were so many problems with this season, it's hard to list them all without giving away some major plot points, but just about every single character on the show has an arc. The worst arc sadly belonging to Terry, one of my favorite characters, where we finally find out the reason he has PTSD. Of course, because it's TRUE BLOOD, instead of it having a reason that in something mundane, it has to be something supernatural and bat-poop crazy in nature. Even worse is the primary arc of Jason who knows, thanks to Sookie and her Lafayette-as-medium conversations with Gran, that their parents were indeed murdered by a vampire thanks to a generations-old contract that the Stackhouse family had with this one vampire. Loyalties, motivations and characterizations shift with no organic reasons other than, ""Oh, here's a new idea; let's have (character A) do (something bizarre) to, or with, (character B)"". That's usually not a very good way to get any kind of interesting conflict going, and that's most of what this season is: conflict for conflict's sake. The only story arc that seemed at all interesting was that of Alcide and his father, played by an increasingly grizzled Robert Patrick.

Performances are still good for the most part, with the standouts being Alexander Skarsgard and Deborah Ann Woll. And the weak link of the cast still remains Rutina Wesley, but I don't think it's necessarily her fault as an actress, but more that Tara is just a cringe-inducing character.

The truly bothersome part of the season is the idea of fundamentalism and extremism. Obviously this is the show's agenda to show how these ideas are tearing apart this country and the world, which is particularly pronounced with the pro-human groups wearing Obama masks when they murder the supers, because evidently, the show is trying to make some kind of political statement with that. By having them wear Obama masks is them showing an explicit statement, although, what that statement is, I have no idea. They could have just as easily worn Halloween masks, or ski masks or anything to hide their faces, but... Obama masks. It reeks of desperation to show a socio-political parallel where there doesn't need to be one. On the extremist side of the vampires, though, there is some fun to be had with the Council, which Roman (Meloni) is the leader of, alongside the original Salome (Valentina Cervi), who seems to find a new target of seduction with Bill.

Naturally, there's a lot of sex and a lot more blood than in any of the previous seasons, and really it's more distracting window-dressing to keep viewers with gaping mouths rather than asking questions of just what the hell is going on.

This is easily the worst season this show has had, and is going to be one of those shows that I'm going to become increasingly disinterested in if it keeps going in this direction.",1351641600,60,4505,4.833981841763943
7162649,5,B00X7SIALI,"This season nailed it on the head, streamlining a lot of unnecessary stories and characters. Increasing the stakes much higher than ever before and providing us with characters interacting in ways they've never done before. Overall very impressed by this season and wanting more.",1349913600,11,279,5.363636363636363
7162650,5,B00X7SIALI,True Blood Season 5 is the best! From season 1 to season 5 I am hooked! Can not wait for the next season.,1348185600,3,105,3.608695652173913
7162651,5,B00X7SIALI,"After season 4, I thought this show was deader than dead. Truthfully, I started to watch season 5 like anticipating a root canal.  I made a vow to myself that I only had to watch the first two episodes and if it were intolerable, I gave myself permission to yank the drill out of my mouth.  Well color me happy with a big box of crayons - True Blood has redeemed itself as one of the most addicting and entertaining series ever.  I feel totally vindicated that all those people who raked us book lovers over the coals for disliking Season 4 because they felt we wanted things to be just like the books were so wrong; we just hated stupid and boring plots, not that they didn't follow the books.  I say Were Droppings to them!

Season 5 won me over because it was a return to well written, funny, full of adventure entertainment. There was more fairy fun.  Tara has become interesting (can you believe it?) and Jason actually had loads to do this season without it feeling gratuitous to keep him employed on the show.  Lots of revealing flashbacks, old characters that we love were brought back, and off the charts humor have succeeded in making my once favorite show a favorite once again.  Never thought True Blood come make a comeback. Bravo!",1347840000,26,1244,4.4734513274336285
7162652,5,B00X7SIALI,"True Blood is absolutely fantastic.  Each season has a clear pathway to follow and the writing is always phenomenal.  While there are some stories don't necessarily make sense with the overall plot, they are usually fun to watch and have interesting twists to add to the story.  The characters are fun and quirky and the villains are sexy and dangerous.  For season 5 you get to learn more about the faeries and Sookie's family and we are finally introduced to who exactly the Authority is.  So if you like vampires and other supernatural creatures this is definitely a good show to check out.  :D",1347667200,8,597,4.6923076923076925
7162653,5,B00X7SIALI,"I love the entire True Blood series. I have not read the books so I can't compare the show to them. I love the actors that play principle parts and I think that is the shows major strength. Alexander  Skarsgard, Stephen Moyer and Anna Paquin are first rate all the way. Secondary players are always well cast. That alone makes this a top series and it is the main reason I have HBO while new shows are on.",1347494400,5,405,4.1923076923076925
7162654,4,B00X7SIALI,"Yes I agree after watching this so far season it has gone wayyyy past the books. It is of it own mind now. Yes character names are the same. But the plots are wayyy different from the books. And also the characters yes there are some in the series who aren't even in the books let alone died early on I the book series. So I say.....o wells!! The books and the series with two different minds??! That's just means double Sookie, Bill and of course Eric time!",1347148800,5,458,4.215909090909091
7162655,2,B00X7SIALI,"Is it just me, or does it seem like the further away the HBO series gets from the Sookie Stackhouse books, the weirder and stranger it gets?
I don't have anything against TV adaptations not sticking 100% to the originals. But if you're going to go in a different direction, make it a better one. In this case the TV series is so far out there and so far from the books, I'm having a hard time holding on to my enthusiasm for the show. The only thing season 5 of the TV series seems to have in common with the book is that someone is killing shifters. The rest of the plot is completely different and not in a good way.
In the books, the drama, for the most part, is very human, despite the fact that not all the characters are 100% human. It's love, lust, greed, sacrifice and it's very relatable. In this season of the show the drama is violent, bloody, weird, confusing and... despite all of that... sort of boring.
Bill and Erik are hanging out with the Vampire Authority while Sookie is left to deal with the attacks on shifters and her own Fey-related drama. One of the most intriguing parts of the book series - the Bill-Erik-Sookie triangle is nowhere to be found. All the characters have their own separate plot lines that don't seem to have anything to do with one another.
Without giving away anything for those who haven't seen it yet, I'll give you my brief assessment: If this is the direction in which the makers of the show are heading, I may be giving up on this series altogether. It failed to keep me interested.",1346716800,46,1530,4.353146853146853
7162656,4,B00X7SIALI,"This is pornography plain and simple. It is a very good story, very great actors. But everyone in that town is a wh***
These people are so wrapped up in having sex that it ruined a lot of the story. Like, Sams gal died and less than a day later hes doing someone else. Then Alcied died and next day or so Sookie went off to comfort  Bill. Diminished Alcied terribly. Great stories for a lot of other characters that do not take their cloths off every day. I wonder if the actors ever said oh no, do I have to take my clothes off again? Anyway I had to fast forward a lot. Been there done that don't have to have it shoved in my face. I really like the twists and turns in the story and would recommend it to anyone.",1516838400,,715,4.0

When she gets into fights I root for the person assaulting her hoping they would kill her... I'm just tired of seeing her... Most of the characters on here are annoying, the decisions they make are sometimes in the WTF category. And why did they made Bill the romantic interest they could have done better... or made Eric the main romantic interest. I also don't understand why everybody is constantly after Sookie's faerie hot box. I have many reasons for not liking the show but... I can't seem to stop watching...

We would immediately continue the Amazon prime portion of our ""Amazon prime and Chill"" after we were sufficiently chilled but ""Tru""ly"" it is a bloody, gory, sexy, hot, terrific, amazing series and surprise character changes every step of the way. We're so glad we hit the  ""begin watching"" button that day 8 days ago lol.

I also didn't appreciate Pam as a maker. Tara becomes more of a loose particle it seems. Thankfully, Lafayette & Jason are always the comic relief.",1483401600,,308,4.618181818181818

7162875,1,B00X7SIALI,"I liked the first two seasons of True Blood. After a several year hiatus, I am trying to complete the series. The story is weak, the characters are flat and continue to get into silly situations. The show passes off Sookie as an innocence girl but she spreads her legs for every supernatural creature in the show. And the male characters stupidly continue to fall for her. I'm surprised she is a fairy not a succubus",1482969600,,416,4.4868421052631575

7162925,1,B00X7SIALI,"I would give this a higher rating, except Amazon is withholding season 7 unless I pay $4 per episode.

I don't have great Internet but Netflix, youtubr, hulu and HBO Go work just fine (which I where I eventually watched True Blood instead). Amazon though was laggier than a windows 98, it does not stop to load but continuously streams in such a way that watching anything is like watching a bad stop motion film.

Yes, I realize it is just a series and these are just actors, but I use Tv as an escape---sort of---and I am a fan of True love---happily ever after, etc. So, I am disappointed that they don't end up together.

And Bill's embracing of the Sanguinista movement simply isn't credible.  Two episodes to go, but I fear that the season can't be rescued.

And Sookie's story is being handled abominably.  The night she puts on a light show at her house is the show's dumbest moment so far.",1467244800,,441,4.602564102564102

I'm watching it again to make sure I can keep up with the season going forward but as I'm watching I remember why this was not my favorite season.  Things got too religious with The Authority.  It wasn't simply about saving Sookie anymore from the dangers that she faced.  Every character now had something going on with them which I know will eventually bring them all back together for the common goal ""SAVE SOOKIE"" but I'm still teeter tottering with my thumbs up or down for this season.

7163516,5,B00X7SIALI,"Season 5 of True Blood was very nicely done. The plot is based on plot of Charlaine Harriss novels and takes the audience in many different directions. It leaves you hanging off the edge of your seat the whole time. The earlier seasons have a few main characters but this season focuses on many different characters. I can see how some people may think that with so many different characters there is a lack of focus or unity of survivor throughout the season. However, I enjoyed and appreciate the vast story lines and personalities that were portrayed through each character. It was also interesting how Paquins Sookie-the series main lead character was isolated from everyone and everything. She is constantly complaining how everyone hates her.

This season reaches a new peak of nudity and gore by including characters who have little to say while they walk around wearing nothing but blood. While I enjoy the writing and acting of the main characters most of the time, there are too many 180-degree reversals of motivation for reasons that are too thin. The season lacks as strong a direction as I'd prefer, and the vampire politics get old. And yet, still I watch it.",1465257600,,564,4.594059405940594

7163790,4,B00X7SIALI,"Well, to be fair I'm only halfway through this season but so far I'm really enjoying it.  Again, it is interesting to see what's been taken from the books and what is totally new.  In several of the situations, some of it was in the books but not exactly the same circumstance.  I'm hoping, in many ways, they keep changing it up like that because a couple things from the books were so annoying.
I like to dynamic between Bill and Eric and how they are both just waiting for Sookie to say ""on second thought, let's give it a shot"" and yet they continue on with their vampire schemes and motivations.  This season we learn about 2 different factions of vampires, some want to peacefully coexist, others see humans as a delicious food source and little more.  Which side will our local vamps choose, because I'm betting by the end of the season they'll have to pick?
I am happy Tara is still around-no thanks to annoy Debbie Pelt, who died way better in the book.  And I really look forward to seeing her character grow in new ways now that she's a vampire (definitely not in the books).
Who is shooting the local shifters?  This is one of the other story arcs this season.  I have no idea who to suspect at this point...  I'm glad that Andy is taking some help from Sam on this investigation.
Is Jason going to meet the future Mrs Jason (and will she be the nice girl who tames the man down)?  What's with the fairy bar in the field?  Will Jason ever figure out that, like his sister, he has fairy blood?  Hello, it's like saying my sister is 1/2 Irish, but it skipped me... Is that going to be in the show?
What's up with Andy (fairy flings, really)?",1462406400,,1651,4.307443365695793

I don't love the Sangunista angle, and yet it does create a lot of tension and cliffhangers for the show, so I guess the writers are doing their job. I'm a reluctant fan of the books. I love the stories but I think they are written crappy. The show takes the good parts like ERIC and runs with it. Love Jessica; love Tara, love Jason, don't like Sookie much, but I don't like her in the books either. I think that is sort of the point.",1461715200,,489,4.0

7163856,1,B00X7SIALI,I like the series but was only able to watch seasons 1-5 even though I have a Prime membership.  It's ridiculous to only offer 5 of 7 seasons. I will not $2.99 pay per episode when I've already paid for the membership. I guess I'll check other shows before getting inventing in them.,1461110400,,283,4.339622641509434

Eric is Eric again, and Tara comes back thanks to some lesbian vampire blood. The whole Vampire Council though, is pretty disappointing. Some of the characters were laughable at best. There is a lot of nudity in this season, not the least of which is the Lilith character who comes and goes throughout. The story of the fairies is advanced as Sookie and Jason learn more about them, and Andy gets a return visit from his pregnant Fairie paramour. The werewolves are involved, but largely in a separate storyline. Overall, a very entertaining, sexy and funny season that is really satisfying to watch. Well Done!",1457136000,,759,4.801526717557252

7164150,1,B00X7SIALI,"I'm a fan  but not a fanatic  of the books, and by season 5 True Blood diverged too far from Harris's originals. When the show first came out, I didn't have live TV. Irushed out to get the DVDs of season 1 as soon as they were available. After season2, I waited until they were on sale. By season3, Ididn't buy the DVDs at all and by season4 I'd abandoned the show after watching a couple of episodes. Iwas pleased to see the first five seasons free on Amazon Prime so Icould catch up and see if the passing years since they had first aired might have changed my opinion. Nope. There's no way I'd pay to see seasons 6 and 7. Imight dig out my paperbacks, though, and re-read books 19. They're still entertaining.

Some changes were good, and I know enough to recognize those made specifically to adapt the story to the screen medium. Making Tara black was brilliant, as was inventing Jessica, and I'm glad they enlarged Lafayette's role and changed Eric's maker to a positive character. But most changes were senseless and bizarre, or even creepy. The explosion from a minor to dominant role of the maenad  who is not called Mary Ann  in season 2 put me off entirely. The change in the nature and character of fairies, ditto. Ifast forward through the maenad scenes when Iwatch reruns. With the shows, unlike the books, it was impossible to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it. Alan Ball and his successors as show runners need to look up the word _verisimilitude_ before attempting a new project.",1454976000,3,1498,4.553903345724907

Perhaps the loss of momentum played a part in my disappointment.  I really enjoyed the first and second seasons but the plot lines have become more and more ridiculous.

Yes, some crazy stories but they capture you and don't let go when you are watching it.  I am a die hard fan of this show so although there are those who give it bad ratings maybe they are looking at it from too critical of an eye, it is just pure entertainment. Yes there are some racy scenes and it is not for the faint of heart, but I sure do love it and always will. It is my go to show when there is nothing on regular tv which is a lot lately. I miss the characters especially Lafayette, Jason, Eric, Bill, Jessica, detective bel flour, terry, Jesus, sookie of course and the lovable Hoyt and I'm sure I missed some but I'm telling you, these people are lovable and make this show the great show that it is.

My initial reaction was this is slow and boring and after 3 consistent episodes, I started seeing interesting stuff and then I got hooked on to it. I pretty much all of the shows that are available either on Prime or Netflix.

This show usually contains some level nudity and explicit content and if you are sensitive please stay away from this show.

I am looking forward to the next season on Amazon and can't just wait. For all those who tried watching and did not like, I would say please retry and watch the first 3 or 4 episodes and if you still don't like it then may be it's not the kind of shows you like.",1443139200,,782,4.277027027027027

I was anxiously waiting for Season 5 to become available and I was more than a little disappointed.  The plot seemed to take a bizarre turn with Bill & Erik and the Vampire Authority worshipping ""Lilith"" who was the ""orignal vampire.""  This season seemed to focus less on Sookie's adventures and more on the Vampire League.  Alcide and the werewolves and the fairies were thrown in here and there but I missed Sookie!

7164967,4,B00X7SIALI,"Great Show. I personally never hopped onto the vampire bandwagon, couldn't stand all the vampire shows and movies. True Blood is an exception. The storyline is suprising. But what really makes this show is the characters/actors. The characters are interesting and the actors do a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life. My biggest compliant is the the dialogue. For an HBO show the dialogue is sometimes too simple and I can't help but think: who wrote this? I find myself enjoying the show more and more as the seasons go on. Season 5 is the best so far. The storyline takes some intresting turns. You can't help yourself from heavily investing into the characters.

7164971,4,B00X7SIALI,"Amazing show. Great deal of activity. Writers keep a viewer guessing at the next turn. It's like, ""What's the next worst thing that can happen?"" I don't know the series of books it's based on, but I'm impressed at where they take this story line, paralleling with 20th century culture and history. The comedic dialogues are especially entertaining when they show off how dumb a character can act. Breaks up the tension. Anna Paquin's character somehow maintains a sweetness and stability while all the others are either being bullies or victims. She is that focal point in a composition that gives a moment's rest for the viewer. She's Alice of Wonderland. Admittedly, I fast forwarded through some of the redneck hunting scenes. They could have shortened a bunch of those scenes and the story line wouldn't have suffered. I'm satisfied to stop watching this series now. They really go way over the top in taste too much even for me. I can only take so much grotty fantasy before I need my eyes and ears washed out.",1440201600,,1015,4.740112994350283

7164989,5,B00X7SIALI,"I was hooked on Trueblood from the first episode.  Season 5 has stepped it up, again!  I hope this show goes on for a very long time or until the actors have had enough and it all is brought to a natural conclusion.  The characters are a bit ""campy""; but each one is strong and well developed. This show goes beyond just the main characters because you have equally intriguing story-lines for all the supporting cast.  Sometimes, this can be a little over whelming or get in the way; but there always seems to be a connection down the line and worth waiting for. It's part of life, and it never weaves in a straight line.
 It is fun to compare the individual characters, some are overly dramatic and others just seem to fall into s..t, wondering ""what happened?""  You can easily be drawn in and need a fix of another episode before you know it.  Watch for the drama or watch for a laugh, you can find both and more.",1439942400,,915,4.315789473684211

7165079,4,B00X7SIALI,Overall this series gets a 5 star rating. The problem with Season 5 was in making Bill Compton a villain. Some of the dialogue is laughable but Sookie still remains Sookie.

If you like or don't mind these topics, then this is a pretty entertaining show, with lots of plot twists keeping you constantly off balance, not knowing what to expect next.

They hide it a lot with no sidelong body shots, mostly neck up and frumpy clothes on Sookie, which just makes it more obvious.  Most fun is with Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare) frollicking about doing his normal screw human society antics.  There are some interesting twists that develop from the mayhem.

The season overall was still pretty good but not my favorite so far. The worst storylines were Terry's, the fairies, and wolves, I think the writers realized none of those are needed just used as filler taking Way from the better characters and stories, so at least they notice when something is not working and usually tend to drop it.",1438992000,,473,4.576470588235294

I can understand why a vampire might long for the true death after watching the eternal middle-school like drama which seems to be the primary purpose of The Authority.

This story wouldn't work so well set in Boston. I like that several of the main characters are black. And only one of them has disappeared or died.  The friendship of Suki and Tara is wonderful.

You have everything from unique violence to unique sex. The main plot of the story keeps you glued to your seat not wanting to miss anything. It moves very fast!. The writing reminds me of the Walking Dead' except that here it goes at the speed of light in comparison. You still have no problems in keeping track of the subplots since they all come together around Sooky who has natural powers that she is not aware of having for the most part. Still, she is sought after by vampires in hopping to get her blood and be able to be in daylight. I don't want to give anything away except what I already said.

7165342,3,B00X7SIALI,"I am a fan of True Blood as a whole, but in this particular season, I have grown very disgusted with Bill. For someone who has always been seen as strong minded and a very centered individual, he has been shown as a very gullible character. He avoids rationalizing and examining the bottom line of any situation. He has grown to be an unstable character. Maybe it was the heartache from the Sookie's indecisive attitude or they wanted to explore a different side of Bll, but it does not work well for him. Sookie on the other hand, remains the same. An irritable, indecisive, unstable, random character that is attracted to any and every attractive male that looks in her direction. Now, she is complaining about being a fairy, which explains her ability to hear people's thoughts. She is constantly using her gift, but then complains about using the gift. Make a decision that is not selfish and at the risk of others!",1438128000,,919,4.644171779141105

The beginning was better than the end, just like the books, well with the books all books after the first two stunk, but that is a different story.

7165386,4,B00X7SIALI,"Here I thought season 4 was very twisted and emtional, but this season 5 was far more emtional and full of twist turns that even I never saw coming as I tried to guess as I watch the season episode by episode.  As normal had mutiple storylines and I enjoy the guess star from Law and Order SVU was an added treat within the season and was like I reconize him and like him as an actor.  I will not do spoilers but the overall storyline of vampire verses vampire lived up to the hyped, but some of the other storylines I can tell are losing some of their fire meaning I think they lost their normal story writers for the show.  If that was the case I can tell why Alan Ball left this show and his creation after this season.  Although I have watched this show since the start I still plan to finish the show season 6 and 7 just to see how it ends for my own eyes.  Just like I read th stories on Dexter and how it ended and still got all the seasons and enjoyed that showed all the way to the end.  So in closing if you still love one liners and storylines you will enjoy watching threwout the whole season and a few that make you go what the heck is going on here then you will love this season of True Blood.  But like end of season 4 the end scene for season 5 made my mouth drop open and say oh my God really this is amazing.",1436227200,,1327,3.9291044776119404

7165460,5,B00X7SIALI,"Probably one of the better seasons, if not the best.  (Surprising because the show had been going downhill.)  There were interesting new characters, and thankfully, less Sookie Stackhouse, who is probably one of my least favorite characters.  I almost dislike her more than Arlene Fowler Bellefleur.

Great premise.  The introduction of the often said but little heard Vampire Authority.  Roman Zimojic alienated, and Salome seduced.  I loved Nora Gainesborough, especially her cool introduction, but I hated that she wasn't as tough or as savvy as promised.  I hoped more from her character.  Denis OHare as Russell Edgington is so good.  Not as much of a showy role as in season 3, but still magnetic.

I also loved Tara as a vampire.  She still bickered, whined and complained, but at least Pam (probably my favorite character next to Eric Northman) knew how to handle her.  Loved both their chemistry and tension.

Good season and great ending.  And again, I cant help emphasizing how the focus wasn't on Sookie.  The character is beyond irritating; she is actually dumber than the more glamoured Ginger, and she makes Bella from Twilight look like a genius.  How almost all the male characters seem smitten with her is impossible to digest.  It was a serious flaw to the series.",1426636800,,1283,4.943661971830986

7165473,5,B00X7SIALI,"True Blood is an excellently written series. I have watched it since it began, and recently bought this dvd set for my nephew. It is nothing like the Twilight series, and in my experience, people who really love Twilight usually do not care for this series - again, simply because the two are nothing alike. Some of the main characters here (as well as supporting roles) are vampires, but that's not to say this is a show ""about vampires."" This series is really best described as being about the people and goings-on of a small, backwoods Louisiana town where some of the people just happen to be vampires.

As mentioned above, the writing is excellent. One of the best aspects about this series is that it is definitely NOT predictable! Not in the least. You never know where the writers are going to take you...from one episode to the next, or from one season to the next. The character development, story lines, acting, directing, casting and effects are all first rate. Considering that the series has its fair share of killing (although not overly so, and it's certainly not the focus of the show), the series couldn't be called ""dark"" or gory by any means. I also would not call this show necessarily ""violent"" either. (Personally, I don't care for violent shows or movies, and I find this series to be tolerable on the violence scale. It does have killing and blood and bodies and body parts, after all there are vampires in it, but even so, it's done in a way that is not offensive or vulgar.)

There is comedy, drama, action and suspense...and very well choreographed cliff-hangers to end each episode. Despite the blood, death and suspense, the series as a whole is well balanced with comedy and other character's story lines which help keep it from being overly dark. There is a quite a bit of nudity - not raunchy, but tasteful and almost artful. So if you're sensitive to nudity, just be forewarned...or simply cover your eyes during those parts, because the story lines and acting make this series well worth watching. I easily give 5-stars to every season.

Another refreshing bonus is that the episode commentary for every season is also worth watching. The actors, directors and writers actually contribute thoughtful and interesting tidbits that add to the episodes and the series. It's best to watch the commentary after you've completed the season because sometimes they accidentally reveal things that happen later in that season.

This series is well worth purchasing.",1424822400,,2490,4.838028169014085

Explores relationships with loved ones, broken relationships, the community, etc., and it reflects that some issues in reality never go away. It's life and we must deal with them and some people simply refuse to change for the better.

And of course the humor. I absolutely LOVE the humor and jokes in True Blood.",1405382400,,447,4.730769230769231

Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer)  and  Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgrd) play a very different role in this season.  While I found Moyer's acting better in previous seasons Skarsgrd's really shines here.  The main characters fill out details on the vampire mythos and explore religion and insanity through a good story arc.  While I found some of the subplots rather predictable, overall this season is great fun and worth watching.",1404432000,,535,5.011363636363637

7165705,5,B00X7SIALI,"Loved the books...and unfortunately books don't often translate well to film...er...dvd.  This season isn't anywhere near the books now, and is taking on a life of its own.  That's ok...it's a good life.  Season 5 is great..and follows an outstanding cast we met in season 1. The acting is top-notch, the dialog is about as Southern as being there, the scenery is great and the music is just about the best in any series anywhere...what else can I say?  I'll let others give you a scene by scene breakdown.  I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books first, then started watching True Blood.  I'm enjoying the series tremendously...and finally getting to see who these people (?) are!  If you enjoyed the books you'll like the series.  If you haven't read the books, you'll enjoy the series!

7165709,3,B00X7SIALI,I have watched all the seasons so far up to this point so continued to watch this one even though it's getting crazy! I am a huge fan of the books and have been disappointed a little bit with past seasons cause they've strayed so far away from the story line I loved in the books. I am trying to think of it as a totally different story to keep my disappoint in check but still--this season is getting to be a little bit too much for me. I will probably still get the last 2 seasons though to complete my collection. Hopefully it will get to be better in season 6.,1403395200,,564,4.044642857142857

This show though is not for the faint of heart as their is A LOT of gruesome violence like people exploding or heads getting ripped off and their is a LOT of nudity and sex so it is NOT for children.",1403222400,,460,4.122222222222222

Where the previous seasons were definitely above the bar, this one just felt average. The use of pop songs that started in Season 3 continues here and I don't really like it.  Feels trite.
I rate all six seasons as follows:
Seasons 1-3 - 5 stars
Season 4 - 4 stars
Season 5 - 3 stars

I keep saying that if they have Sookie wake up in the hospital because she hit her head and start over at the end of season 1leaving Laffiet as the cook at Merlotts with big Johnthen tell the story by the books by Charlain Harris..the series could go on 14 more years.

Definitely not something for the young adult to be watching but us adults sure can watch and watch and watch!! I won't dare miss an episode and sometimes find that I will watch the new episode 2-3 times the first night it airs! Really good series just wish there were more episodes to each season and I HATE that this coming season (in 2014) will be the final season! Now that really sucks!!,1392681600,5,491,4.3478260869565215

7165774,2,B00X7SIALI,"This show started out great, the first few seasons covered a lot & I loved the deadpan humor.  As it went on & they started developing the sub characters I started to dislike the show.  Just seemed to be a bunch of filler to me.  Each new season seemed to take longer to go nowhere.  By the time This season came out it seemed obvious to me that everyone involved with the show especially the writers were tired.  Just seems like they are doing whatever they can to get through the seven season contracts or obligations.  I really loved it at one time but now it's not enough for me.  There is another show I love (I won't mention the name) but the writers & creator of it make me feel like they love us fans enough to pack the episodes with almost more than we can handle.  I just wish True blood did that.",1391644800,,807,4.161290322580645

7165778,5,B00X7SIALI,"I love True Blood.  I'm a new fan.  I bought season 1 on Blu-Ray just months ago and loved it so much I sought after the later seasons.  There were some things which I thought they focused on too much, like the sex scenes, but I assume some people love the sex scenes.  Ha.

Anyway, season 5's ending is the most abrupt of all the endings in all the seasons thus far.  I have not seen season 6 yet, mind you, and there is a season 7 in the works.  You may want to wait for the series to end before watching it if you're the impatient type.  Consider yourself warned.

The special features for season 5 are actually a lot more informative than those found in the previous seasons.  We get more information about the vampire bible, and we learn a lot more about Eric's backstory.  We also get a couple in-character monologues for Godric and Steve Newlin.  Steve Newlin's monologues are great.  Godric makes his appearance in this season, and he does have a moment in the character monologues, as well, but his part is so small I wouldn't pay it much mind.  Some cut scenes were made available in Enhanced View mode which I thought were rather nice additions, but I couldn't name those scenes off the top of my head.  Episode 6 has a behind-the-scenes extra that I honestly have not watched yet.

If you're looking for a show that is given a lot of attention to detail, True Blood is a nice choice.",1391385600,2,1395,4.348837209302325

I'm partial to the book series more than the TV show, but they're both good for different reasons and have followed different paths.  If you have seen the previous four seasons, you'll be curious as to what is happening with Sookie, Bill, Eric, Pam, Tara, Lafayette, Sam, and all the rest of the gang.  I wouldn't call it a ""must watch"" anymore, but it's nice to know what happens to characters you care about.

As far as season five goes, really, I guess if you didn't read the books it would be good to you. But really, no plot, no story line, none of it is even a little interesting. I am considering not buying the next season. I can't believe the author of such good books would allow this to happen. Totally destroyed the story line, was really good, a good author for a while but not any more, greed once again takes the top billing. Now it's assemble line production. Not only will I not buy next season but no more of her books. Any one who sells out like that can't be that good really. So sad about my own judgement. When an authors let their books be destroyed they must not be that good, maybe fun to read but no good as a TV program. It could have been. Season 4 and 5 further and further away from the real story line of the books. Still watching season 5 and I can't believe how bad it really is, will watch to the end just because I was hoping maybe something would be good, but no, none of it was any good. What a piece of CRAP
have to watch it I paid for it. SUCH A BAD JOB, SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH THE STORY LINE, STINKS, STINKS, STINKS!!!!!!!!
I guess the people who think it's good are the people who never read the books

7165860,4,B00X7SIALI,"By Season 5, True Blood is really beginning to get a little sloppy. There are so many different subplots going on that it I am going to have to do a quick review of what happened in the previous seasons before the release of Season 6 to remind myself of what each character is doing.

Just when we thought there couldn't be any more supernatural characters to introduce, this season also introduces supernatural creatures from arabic folklore called, ""irfrits"", while maintaining its packs of werewolves, covens of witches, and clans of vampires. Here, too, the concept of vampire ""nesting"" is introduced, as we see Vampire Bill stray ever farther away from Sookie than before. Tara, Lafayette, and Pam begin a journey of their own as the story of Tara, the Vampire, begins. Vampires higher in the authority struggle for power in this season, leading to chaos and a new political regime. Meanwhile, the werewolves and shapeshifters have a beef with one another while trying to stay safe from an anonymous attack force aimed at supernaturals.

The season is jumpy and leaves very little room for rest between episodes. They naturally fall into the next with plot twists and cliff hangers that leave the viewer dying to know what's coming next - a little more incisively than the previous few seasons. This is partially due to the highly divided nature and number of subplots wrapping around the story. While the anticipation used to leave me wanting more, the story's beginning to feel a bit distorted and clumsy.

It will be interesting to see what happens in Season 6.",1382140800,,1569,4.868913857677903

(HBO, 2013)
. . .
NOTE: mild spoilers below. don't freak out.
. . .

Like a lot of my favorite cable dramas, in its later seasons ""True Blood"" has become a bit of a chore to watch.  The show has always been saddled with a profusion of less-than-interesting characters and mediocre actors. My favorites are generally the vampires, namely (in order of preference) Eric, Jessica, Russell, Pam and, once upon a time, Bill, though he's been pretty dull the last few seasons. Then there's Tara, Andy, all the shifters, all the werewolves and now all the faeries... all so immensely dull!  For some reason the producers felt obliged to lump each superhuman group into various dated, stereotyped human subcultures: vampires are goth, the werewolves are semi-biker trash, the shifters are hillbillies and now the faeries (so sinister and Gaiman-esque when they first appeared) have been reduced to bland Euro-trash sex-club ravers.

The current central plot - of the inner vampire cabal staging a political coup - has some sharp moments of interest, but the revolving subplots are generally a drag. Terry's PTSD demon - meh. Tara's getting vamped: also has potential, but mainly because it keeps Pam in the spotlight. I always enjoy seeing Jessica onscreen, and oddly enough feel the same about Andy Lefleur. But Lafayette, Andy, Lilith and that werewolf dude are all the kiss of death. There's a remarkably high percentage of on-screen tedium for one show to handle. And of course the producers try to make up for it with lots of ""shocking"" sex scenes, but oh my god it that getting super-old. Nekkid bodies do not compensate for weak writing. ""True Blood"" has always been a trashy show -- that's why we watch it -- but there's trashy good and trashy-yawn, and even though I'm interested enough to keep watching, I wish the show would push itself a little.  The neutered, cartoonish representation of the faeries is particularly disappointing: very little creative thinking seems to have gone into their portrayal. And, omigod, I wish they'd drop the werewolves altogether.

Anyway, the show continues to be interesting enough to watch, but just barely. I guess if I made it through ""Weeds,"" I can make it through this as well. Is Season Seven really going to be the last?  Well, let's hope they pick up the pace a little. (Axton)",1381190400,,2362,4.89

7165875,3,B00X7SIALI,"When you dig a little deeper, there's some interesting comments about religion and power in this season. While I love Terry, I could have done without his side story. There are highlights to enjoy. The return of Russell and his relationship with Steve Newlin, the turn around in Bill and Eric's relationship, and True Blood's version of the Scooby gang looking for Russell.",1381104000,,373,4.936507936507937
7165876,4,B00X7SIALI,"Season 5 was almost silly and, to be truthful, sometimes it WAS too silly. Ultimately it did deliver on the fun which I have come to expect. I had started to dread seeing certain faces pop up on the screen simply because in previous seasons they either cried or did incredibly stupid things purely in the name of lame plot devices. Yes, I'm thinking Tara. Season 5 was entertaining enough to have me impatiently awaiting for season 6 to come out on DVD.",1381104000,,453,4.469879518072289

7165915,2,B00X7SIALI,"Pretty much the entire season is without much in the way of substance. Every episode has to do with the AUTHORITY. I don't understand why the vampires all tip their hats to the ""authority"". They have lived for thousands of years without that kind of Gestapo organization. It's no longer a story about Sookie Stackhouse. Tara still hates everybody for everything Including having her ""life"" saved.
Without boring you as much as true blood season five will, let me just say that it is a documentary of vampire and werewolf politics. Mainly just politics.
Or, another way of looking at it, would be that it has turned into a soap opera with all familiar characters from true season four. But as far as anything ""cool"" happening, I think you will be disappointed.",1378944000,,759,4.757575757575758
7165916,5,B00X7SIALI,I wasn't as crazy about the fourth season as I had been of others and I assumed that the 5th would just continue what I saw as the beginning of a downward spiral for True Blood.

7165920,2,B00X7SIALI,"Yeah. I was not feeling all the religious themes going on in this season. Also, I think Eric's sister is cute and all but I felt like her character was completely unnecessary.

To anyone that likes soap opera, lots of mythical and supernatural villains, good guys and mystery of discovering which is which then I suggest one starts with season one and become addicted.

7165944,5,B00X7SIALI,Season Five was fun unlike the disappointing sixth season.  Buying True Blood on sale makes sense.  I picked it up because I have all the other seasons. But the only reason I would even consider buying Season Six next year would be if it's dirt cheap because it was THAT poorly written.  Season Five? Recommended.,1377734400,,313,4.654545454545454

7165965,5,B00X7SIALI,"I'll tell you right from the start: season 2 was (and still is) my favorite season of Blood. I was the guy who scoffed when his wife brought the season dvd home (she had borrowed it from a friend). I cared very little about vampires in general. Zombies are where it's at. Just ask any guy my age (28). But whatever she watches, I watch. We do everything together; we're one of those couples. In no time at all I was hooked. The character Sam helped a lot. Here's this cool, scruffy, middle-aged white dude running a bar in a little old town in Louisiana who seems like the kind of guy you'd like to buy a beer. Long story short, I was up all night, got no sleep at all, glued to the tv with as much enthusiasm as my wife waiting to find out what happened next. I didn't want to go to work! Well, who ever does? But I didn't want to wait until I got home to catch the last couple of episodes. Until I watched season 5, I didn't think that they would make another season as captivating as 2 was. But they did.

This fifth season's storylines ran a bit sour until the end when TRUE BLOOD was given another chance at life (ironically).  The current (sixth) season whil still running on the air is a great transition from the last part of Season 5.

It doesn't necessarily go as you would think, and the amount of blood in this one is at an all-time high.  The sex, however, is pretty low.  It's there, just not as prevalent as seasons past.

I could watch it 24/7. (I also love the Sookie Stackhouse novels! I wish Ms. Harris had never decided to end this series. But I'll forgive her.) What amazes me about True Blood, the television series, is how the writers have further developed and expanded the characters. Many of the preternatural creatures often find themselves in typically human situations expressing human emotions, political ambitions and religious fervor, which strikes a chord with their audience and rings true to life even though the characters are actors playing supernatural beings. This show remains pure genius! Still, it can't be allowed to ride on its  past achievements in seasons 1 & 2. The show is still great and a thrill to watch; but maybe it's getting a bit complex and going down a few too many rabbit trails in season 5.",1375920000,,978,4.620689655172414

Season 5 was just a little too much about the Vampire League.",1375142400,,314,4.064516129032258
7166021,3,B00X7SIALI,"This season was disappointing.  The satire on this show has always been thick, but the religious satire was overbearing in this season.  It lacked the lightness that previous seasons had.  And the scenery/background in the Authority was horribly cheesy.

7166029,5,B00X7SIALI,"I love the show but I'm still not quite sure what to think of this season. The creation of Billith, Tara becoming a vampire, the Terry-Smoke-Monster thing... Nora.  I knew that Sookie's faery heritage was going to start to really play a larger role in the show, but I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it seeping into Andy's life in the form of 4 fae baby girls, abandoned by their mama immediately after their birth.

I hope this leads into something in the sixth season that is a little more cohesive.  While I like to think of the books and the show as two completely separate entities, I do love the fact that the book has the characters directly in Sookie's life and not off on their own ridiculous and completely pointless adventures.  Like Alcide.  He's with her in the first episode or two and then he's off on his own and I don't see any instance where Sookie and Alcide are really going to intersect again.  He's Mr Wolfman and she's off dealing with psycho-Bill/vamp god.",1374969600,,984,4.4692737430167595

I tend to get the boxed set and watch it marathon-style. LOVE LOVE LOVE True Blood. With that being said, each season is completely different and some are better than others. This season was better than season four I felt but so far I'm a HUGE fan of the First season above all others. Can't wait to see what's next!",1374969600,,476,4.129032258064516
7166031,3,B00X7SIALI,"This season is an overall disappointment to diehard fans.  It provides way too many story lines in snippets that jump back and forth too fast to enjoy and get into.  This trend, which has been accelerating could be due to several writers being assigned to write one story line and they all get together in conference and fight for air time, which they all get but too little to each.

The series badly needs to get back to the wit and coherence of Season One.  For example, Suckie, oops, is thrown into way too many different situations to allow her to express her grounding in ""reality"" she had when she was really ""a waitress.""

Hope the next season returns to what got our attention first.",1374969600,2,692,4.504

I know this review will not be as detailed or helpful, but at this stage, I feel that this season tries to explore every character in the most bizarre situations, and most of them become about 180 degrees the opposite of what they have been throughout the series.

7166078,5,B00X7SIALI,"The 5th season continued with the drama, suspense, and roller coaster rides that the previous seasons provide. The 5th season's story line is a bit more complex than just Sookie's soap opera between Bill and Eric so pay attention. Overall, it's a winner just like the others, and I will continue to watch the series!",1373932800,,316,4.763636363636364
7166079,5,B00X7SIALI,The show is really good. Sookie and Jason Stackhouse are great characters. Eric Northman And Bill Compton are awesome anti-heros. can n ot wait until Season 6.,1373846400,,159,4.925925925925926

7166083,5,B00X7SIALI,"If you've seen the previous 4 seasons of TB, you are not going to be disappointed.  Each episode packs as much surprise in it as well as lots of familiar faces.  Once again, like before, this series has made me laugh, cry, gasp, sigh, sympathize and cringe.  If you like a show that brings out a plethora of emotions, you can count on this one to deliver them.

The plot twist near the end of the season really is a good one and once you start watching the first episode in this season, you'll find it very difficult to resist the temptation to watch all the episodes in one day or one night.

I am not going to spoil the surprise for the uninitiated by telling them everything that happened, they're going to have to start watching to see what I mean.

What are you waiting for, get this and start watching it already.  :)",1373760000,,823,4.2709677419354835
7166084,5,B00X7SIALI,"I started watching this show mainly because it is set and partially filmed in Louisiana, my home state.  I was interested in seeing how the local culture, people, and scenery was betrayed.  Apparently, there is an inordinately large population of supernatural beings here that I hadn't noticed.  Makes for an interesting show, indeed.  Can't stop watching to see what will happen next!",1373673600,,385,5.161290322580645

My husband suggested the series (wow, believe that!) and I had heard about it from my hairdresser.  We ordered the first season and then got the rest based on that.  Real entertainment - like I said, you need to enjoy kinky, funny and a little horror.  And non-human beings.  Let me say that the horror isn't much and is underplayed.  I couldn't recommend another series more!  Can't wait for Season Six!",1373414400,,548,4.454545454545454

7166098,3,B00X7SIALI,I was not happy with the 5th season because they put in the war scenes that was not necessary at all. I read all the books before watching this series & I realize that everything is very different but there was just too much hate & war.,1373328000,,236,4.042553191489362

On second thought, I stopped watching because the 3rd season started getting a little weird (like this is reality or something)  Anyhow, I'm just doing this review because Amazon won't stop bugging me.  I promise to come back someday... and do it up right!  OK, quick update, while on my cruise (the Allure, biggest cruise ship EVER) I watched the last disk of season 3 which catches you up if you've never seen ANY of True/Blood, and I'm all excited about it again.  Too much to do on the Ship and shore so I'll start soon.  PS  Coincidently, my brother just watched True/Blood seasons 3, 4, and 5 back to back.  His comment...,""What happened to the nudity!"")  Well, that's my brother's review!",1373328000,,854,4.529411764705882

After watching the videos from the five seasons I like the show, but there are so many creatures you almost wonder where are the humans? So far there are were panthers, sorceress, mediums, ifrit demons, maened, shaman, ghost, were wolfs, shape shifters, good fairies, bad faires, witches, warlocks, a possessed serial killer baby & most importantly Vampires. This is just the ones I can remember. I think it is getting way to far out there. Both of my son's quit watching it after season 2 for that same reason. They thought it was getting too far out with all the types of creatures in the show.  I'm not sure if I will buy season 6 when it's released. I will say one thing Sookie  lose the vampires & go after Alcide, he's the hottest guy that has been on all the seasons.",1373068800,,866,4.372670807453416

End of the season leaves you on a cliff hanger, but that's great, cause it left me anxious for the next season. I actually had to order HBO!",1372723200,,301,4.298245614035087

7166130,2,B00X7SIALI,"I've been watching this show recently and its funny how bad it is.  All this hype and the show is poorly made, some poor acting and little substance.

7166132,4,B00X7SIALI,"I hate to say it, but I don't much get the allure of True Blood.  I understood the draw durign Sseason 1 when it was basically soft core porn and I definitely got it in Season 2 when I became a fan (however briefly - and after they toned the porn down a bit), but at this point, now in Season 6, this show seems to have run its course.  Luckily, I bought this as a gift for someone who is so hardcore TB (and has been from day 1) that when I bought them the first 6 novels for Christmas a few years back, they read them all within a month - and they weren't even readers before then!  So I give it 4-stars since it was for someone else's enjoyment.",1372723200,,648,3.893939393939394

7166134,5,B00X7SIALI,"If you enjoyed the vampire politics hinted at during Second Season and brought more into flower Third and Fourth Season, you'll probably really enjoy them this season. We experience Bill and Eric's Near True Death adventures, as they collide with the until now hidden Vampire Authority. The first part of the series was my favorite, as those two bond through non stop politicking and peril. Pam is wonderful this season, showing another layer to her character and Tara goes in a fascinating new direction. Sookie has some surprising turns of characters, as does Steve Newlin! :) I did miss all the character commentaries during in-vision, where a whole bunch of different characters would express their point of view during Fourth Season. Fifth Season only had a few characters doing this per in-vision episode, alas. Even so, I really enjoy all the extra information and character development one gets with the in-vision feature on the Blu Ray.",1372636800,,945,5.064102564102564

7166149,5,B00X7SIALI,"As a long time fan of True Blood, I can tell you in complete sincerity that season 5 adds to the series stellar reputation, while upping the ante unlike any of the previous seasons. Season 5 is multifaceted with many thrilling and thought-provoking themes, including the bizarre and skewed ideologies between the Authority and the mysterious Sanguinistas, anti-supernatural hate groups, Sookie's shrouded past, and the return of of one of the show's most memorable villains. This season keeps viewers on the edge of their seats by boldly diving into each character's psyche and revealing some of their twisted and surprising motives.

Season highlight: The final scene, which is arguably the most shocking cliffhanger in True Blood history

Fans of True Blood will absolutely love this season and devour every last drop. If you're new to True Blood, please quit reading this review and go purchase season 1 :)",1372550400,5,909,5.135135135135135

7166155,3,B00X7SIALI,"The True Blood tv series on cable tv, are okay, but not true to the books.  The tv series has so much trash added, that never happened in the books.  But also so much of this trash is violence, and sex, that it's like watching porno flicks at times too.  If Charlaine Harris had kept to her incredible books she wrote, this series could have been shown on main tv networks, rather than just on cable tv.  So in my opinion, she betrayed her books, and characters for the big bucks.....and this is sad.......",1372377600,,506,4.351063829787234
7166156,5,B00X7SIALI,The episodes were action-packed and made the viewer participate emotionally in the story.  Season 5 maintained its vampire-centered perspective in relation to humans (particularly Sookie) and was much better than Season 4 (last season).,1372291200,,236,5.9411764705882355

I will NOT spoil it for those who love this series, but it is time for some new developments and you will see them.

7166163,4,B00X7SIALI,"I decided to start watching True Blood because of the comments I heard from other people.  Vampires and wolves legends always have a % of veracity behind them.  There legends all over the World of vampires and wolves since early days; even in the most remote and older cultures the vampires and werewolves are described.  You might like this because True Blood is based on a series of novels written by Charlaine Harris, whos main character is Sookie Stackhouse.  It depicts stories of Southern Vampire Mysteries in Bon Temps, Louisiana.  To me Bill Compton is the modern day Barnabas Collins.  Is a TV series that should be viewed by over 18, it has a lot of nudity and killing.  Never-the-less, I like it and enjoy watching how the episodes are intertwined and how characters are created or eliminated.  One thing against it is all the extra characters developed; like fairies, shape shifters and other possible additional and fictional character to be introduced in the show.",1372204800,,978,4.884848484848485

7166166,5,B00X7SIALI,I am True Blood fanatic. I love the books and I love the TV show. They are totally different and I think that's why I like it so much. I don't think that the show has to follow the books to be a great show. In some instances the acting can be a little questionable but I love it. Absolutely love it.,1372204800,,299,3.838709677419355
7166167,5,B00X7SIALI,"The series is truly different from the books but I'm glad that they have the creative rights to go in different directions.

Nothing is sacred in this series and anything can happen to any character and that is what is so delicious and fun. If you are new to True Blood, please, buy season one and start from the beginning....you won't regret it and you will want to collect the whole series. ***Just don't compare the books to the series, they do differ greatly and should be considered seperate universes***",1372032000,,554,4.721649484536083
7166189,5,B00X7SIALI,I got hooked on this series right from the start.  I was very happy that I was able to pick up this season for such a reasonable price.  I have already watched the whole season and loved every minute of it.  I no longer have HBO so getting this was a real treat.,1371945600,,262,3.9056603773584904

7166196,3,B00X7SIALI,"I love True Blood, so I would rate it more like three and a half stars, but this season was not the best. This is unusual for me to rate True Blood below a five star. The season was slower, and there were a lot of different stories going on at the same time. I kept wondering if they would connect together, and it seemed like the show was having a hard time doing so. Aside from that, the cliff hanger at the end of the season hooks you back in and makes you wonder what's going to happen. I have a feeling next season will redeem itself.",1371945600,,539,4.0

By the end of season 5 you'll be preying for the days when everyone got along and that Lilith the crazy bitch would go back to wherever she came from. All and all its a blood bath and it ends leaving you for the obvious continuation to come.",1371945600,,391,4.226666666666667

7166202,5,B00X7SIALI,"I find myself among the minority of people who really enjoyed this season. Many people are upset that the main character's love life took the backseat in this installment, but I feel the change was welcome. It gave the producers more time to focus on character development and less to spend creating filler sex scenes. Seriously, how many times do we really need to see the same couple have sex within a single episode? True, some of the story lines are a little out there, but it definitely held my interest.",1371859200,,509,4.604395604395604

7166207,5,B00X7SIALI,"I'm a biased TB fan. I loved this. I loved the audio commentary, especially the last one with Alan Ball who won't be a regular around Season 6, and Anna Paqiun. Love the cast's obvious admiration for each other, and I had no clue Anna was so pregnant with her twins in those last episodes! Did a great job CGI-ing her. As for extra features..give me a good commentary (I admit I was hoping Stephen's would be a little funnier about directing) and Paley, and I'm happy! So far just one show of season six in, can't wait for the rest of the season and DVDs!",1371859200,,555,4.245283018867925

Of course she would be surrounded by a selection of luscious, devoted, hunky men. The writers keep us entertained, on our toes and on the edge of our seats anticipating and relishing the next show. This season was no exception, job well done. I absolutely recommend you purchase not only this season, but all of them, enjoy.",1371859200,,442,4.906666666666666

7166212,4,B00X7SIALI,"I enjoyed the show.  At first I was outraged that it didn't follow the Charlaine Harris books.  But  when taken on it 's own, It is very entertaining.  The season two stories I didn't care for but, as the story goes on I'm getting into it again. The actors are outstanding.

The fairy circus is kind of weird.  However that's Entertainment.",1371772800,,340,4.491803278688525

7166215,4,B00X7SIALI,"I've been buying these ever since season one came out on DVD and have not been disappointed yet.  Sookie Stackhouse is a fabulous character, powerful yet still flawed and vulnerable at times...no matter how much she's gone through.

Season 5 sees the fall-out from the last season and more, as people must come to terms with what their actions (or lack) have wrought.  The Big Heavy from past seasons, the infamous Vampire Authority, is finally shown.  Christopher Meloni does a fabulous job (as ever) with being the head of the Authority and the revelation of various vampire legends and religion is fascinating.  My only quibble was that it meant we spent WAY too much time in their super-secret underground bunker, which got to be kind of boring by the end.

We also get to see Pam's past as various flashbacks unfold in different episodes, leading to a greater appreciation of her as a character.  These flashbacks make further sense as we see Pam trying to deal with becoming a Maker...and with what a child!!!  (OMG, seeing Pam in a sweatsuit--I couldn't stop laughing)  I think that Pam's stuff was wonderful, as it deepens our understanding of her so much, especially as she interacts with Tara.

The Fairy aspect of the show also hasn't been forgotten, as we delve into Sookie's connection to that power in her bloodline and also go back in her family history to explore the death of her parents.  Jason also undergoes a big change as he takes a good hard look at his life.  Lafayette is also forced to deal with the consequences of what happened in the last season.  Tara also goes through a big change and I was practically on the verge of tears by the last episode re her changing relationship with Pam...who woulda thunk?

The only story I wasn't thrilled out was Terry's, because I would have honestly wished to leave any supernatural elements out of that one, just as a counterpoint to all of the supe elements in the rest of the shows.  But that's just a minor wish.

Overall, this show is still going strong and I can't wait to see more...as ever, we are left with a cliff-hanger.",1371772800,,2097,4.642276422764228

7166285,2,B00X7SIALI,"***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!***

I've always enjoyed True Blood as a guilty pleasure.  It was just campy enough to make it entertaining and as a fan of the books prior to seeing the show, I really enjoyed all the creative differences between the two.  Not a show to be taken very seriously, but definitely a heck of a lot of fun.

For some reason, Season Five just seems ridiculous to me.  The Vampire Authority was so stale and uninteresting that I didn't even really care what happened with them, not to mention that seeing them put before the viewer just kills all potential intimidation.  The Authority is supposed to be such a force that even the likes of Eric Northman dances to their tune in prior seasons.  This season showed them to be a small group of quibbling fanatics over a cause that has NEVER been addressed in the prior seasons.  The Vampire Bible?  Really?  Lilith?  Worst villain ever.  Did not care, did not offer any real sense of urgency, made the whole Authority lame.

Tara's initial scenes as a vampire were eyeroll-inducing, though I will say that I ended up loving the relationship that develops between her and Pam.  I'm glad to see Tara a bit mellowed out, but still holding onto that fire.  Watching Pam struggle with having to take care of progeny she never wanted was also interesting, and both actresses pulled it off beautifully.

The plotline with Terry was ridiculous.  Again, I just didn't care.  It seemed like it was just a filler plotline to keep everyone distracted.  Not to mention that I couldn't help thinking that it's been how long since Terry came back from Iraq and it's only now having such an explosive effect?  This really saddened me because I love Terry's character.  But I appreciate that he has always been a supporting cast member and not turned into something dramatic, but allowed to just be an enjoyable part of the daily grind that the main characters go through.

And I think that is one of the biggest problems with True Blood now.  There are almost no supporting characters anymore.  Everyone has to be given their own intense, dramatic, supernatural plotline.  I have literally just watched the final episode less than an hour ago after consuming the box set over the past week, and there was so much going on that I am already struggling to remember who all was doing what-all.  I absolutely love Alcide and I'm glad he hasn't been snuffed out of the picture but there was too much time devoted to his pack drama.  Jason-Hoyt-Jess are all great characters but I feel the time given to their relationship drama might have been better spent elsewhere.  Same with the Obamas line: a hate group out to get supes?  Good addition to the tension but the big reveal about them was barely even a fizzle.  Nora?  Boring and useless, and do we really need random sex scenes between Eric and his sister?  What was the point of Lafayette going after Jesus's grandfather?  And I really, REALLY hope that something major and interesting comes of the quadruplets that are randomly birthed near the end, cause otherwise that's just yet another thread to be dragged along.

I would love to see the show's writers and director tone things down a bit in terms of all the various plots they have running.  Choose a few characters to focus on (maybe our original trio of Bill/Eric/Sookie) and keep the story centered around them.  Have fewer subplots so that you can really explore and engage viewers in them rather than having a billion things happening at once which makes it too difficult to follow (I'm only thankful that I got the box set and wasn't trying to remember what was happening week by week) and it makes it really difficult to care about any of the characters when you don't get to see enough of a single one.

There were a few upsides to this season.  When Steve Newlin showed up at the end of last season, I kinda wanted to bang my head against a desk, but he actually ended up being really fun to watch.  I loved the return of Russell Edgington, who is, I think, one of my favorite bad guy characters in any series ever.  And I really respect the fact that Bill apparently legitimately is subscribing to the Authority's way of thinking.  I kept expecting there to be some elaborate reveal about how he was just going along with it to keep Sookie and the other humans safe, but I'm curious to see where his unlife goes now.

Overall a pretty disappointing season.  Hopefully the next till pick it back up!",1370390400,6,4480,4.6177215189873415
7166286,5,B00X7SIALI,Even though the storyline strays from the books - it's a good take on the characters!  I am hoping that Vampire Bill will prevail.,1370390400,,130,4.416666666666667
7166287,3,B00X7SIALI,Really not much new.  Most of the characters are the same as every year.  Most of the stories are the same.  Needs to have NEW blood.,1370390400,,133,4.038461538461538
7166288,5,B00X7SIALI,I have watched every season of true blood. I'm always anxiously awaiting the next season to come out. The fifth season certainly didn't disappoint. It was great. Now I'm anxiously awaiting the sixth season.,1370390400,,206,5.088235294117647
7166289,5,B00X7SIALI,I love this series and the books.  Can't wait to get caught up.  One of my favorite t.v. series.  Thanks,1370390400,,104,4.1
7166290,3,B00X7SIALI,"There seemed to be too many storylines going on at one time; as if two different True Blood series were trying to coexist with Bill and Eric in one storyline, and Sookie, Jason, Tara, and the rest of the characters in another. Up until about episode 11 and 12, it all seemed a bit disjointed in the viewing. Overall I still love the show and will continue watching.

Seeing Tara as a vampire was great....and with Pam as her maker, I'm hoping their story will be developed more in season 6. I don't have cable TV (refuse to pay for overpriced TV viewing), so I have to wait until Season 6 is released on DVD next year. But the wait is worth it.",1370390400,,644,4.235772357723577
7166291,5,B00X7SIALI,"What I love about True Blood is it's a metaphor for minority groups, political fanaticism and existential questions of life, death, love, and life after death all wrapped around hopes fears desires and sex. This series brings more great drama, some of the best one liners from Pam and twists and turns in some of the main characters personal evolution.

Like in Six Feet Under Alan Ball has created such endearing core characters that you invest, it is another great series and one that I will watch to it's end no matter where it leads us.",1370390400,,540,4.625

7166293,3,B00X7SIALI,"This season seemed to be a lot of build up to next season. Since the show has now deviated away from the books, the viewed doesn't know where the characters are now headed. I don't like this crash course on the Vampire Authority but I am now excited to see where next season is going to go. It may have started out slow. But it sped up toward the end. In fact I feel this was just half a season. I don't understand the need to bring back Newland or Edgington but it doesn't seem to matter for next season.",1370390400,,505,4.06
7166294,4,B00X7SIALI,"Although I must agree that True Blood Season 5 was not as good as previous seasons, I still enjoyed it for the most part.  I think the issue this year was that they tried to introduce too many new story lines without giving them each one enough time to develop.  Overall this left most viewers in the dark trying to figure out what was really going on and feeling like they were caught in a whirlwind.  I think they need to slow it back down a little and let the story lines develop and not try to introduce so many each season, that's my hope for season 6.",1370390400,,557,4.138888888888889
7166295,3,B00X7SIALI,"This season feels like they just wrote stories around soft porn shoots.  It seemed like they wanted to show gratuitous sex scenes and nudity and swearing and attempted to build a storyline around that.  The extreme gore mixed in also just made it too over-the-top for me.  I'm tired of the ""shock factor"" and shows always pushing the envelope with how much blood and gore they include. Perhaps some people are looking for that sort of entertainment, though?  I was hoping for a bit more substance, as it was in the first couple of seasons.  Plus, think the cast is great, so I give it 3 stars because the show would be better if the story improved and the gore and nudity were cut back again.  I give points for throwing a theological dilemma into the mix, but not much else.  Think it's time to retire this show if they can't revisit what made it so great in the first couple of seasons.",1370390400,,888,4.411042944785276

We saw a little less Sookie and more Eric (yay!!),Bill and their business with the Authority, plus the other characters (Sam, Tara, and Lafayette). Terry's storyline was kind of weird and out of nowhere, but whatever. This is a great 'Eric' season, in my opinion. Not like Season 4, with 'Eric-lite' but the real deal. I loved it!

For me the story line has departed from the vampires, my favorite part, and concentrated on the witches more than I would like.  This would be a complaint for the writer and not the people involved with the shows. The making of the series and the actors have done a fantastic job of telling the story.

The 4th season struggled to keep my attention but I still watched because I'm loyal. The 5th season which I recived last week in the mail. I'm still trying to watch because I keep falling asleep. I live in the Bible Belt, if I wanted to watch a bunch of crazy people spout scripture I'd just walk down the street. Hell, my neighbor's been trying to recruit me for years. I'm very disappointed, bored and aggravated by the whole season. What the hell was so wrong with the books that they had to go unhinged into 45 plot lines that do not make a lick of sense? I am no longer a fan. I cannot abide this crap any longer. I dare say, I don't even like Sookie anymore.

7166323,4,B00X7SIALI,"I've been a big fan of TRUE BLOOD since its first season, catching it on its yearly DVD releases.  TB has been inventive, well done and a refreshing alternative to mundane network programming.  However, Season 5 finds the drama perhaps needing a blood transfusion.  Much of what's kept the show so addictive is lost in the superfluous mini-arcs this season.  While appreciating attempts to supply all its cast their ""place in the spotlight"", these arcs were often more a distraction than an enhancement e.g. the smoke monster, the Obama vigilante group and the overly emphasized religious and political barnstorming in the Authority plotline.
Casting was a little disappointing as well. Both Christopher Meloni's character and performance were less than stellar.  The former SVU stalwart didn't bring anything special to the role of Roman.  Standout performances came this season from Deborah Ann Woll (Jessica), Jim Parrack (Hoyt), Kristin Bauer (Pam), Chris Bauer (Andy) and Ryan Kwanten (Jason).  Anna Paquin's Sookie had a more secondary presence this season probably due to her pregnancy and this lessening had a noticeable impact.  Sookie is the heart of TB!

There have been so many plot twists that don't make any sense to the essence of the characters. I have always loved Sookie and Bill and had a serious crush on Erik, but the show has mutated the plot to almost cancerous results. Before this season, I had few, if any, complaints. Now, I will watch it only because my ocd nature insists I finish it. I truly hope they write their way out of this mess and back towards the quality of material that made them so great in the beginning.

On a side note, why would they note include the were-tiger Quinn? Great Character with plenty of logical material. Then again, comparing the books and the show is almost a futile exercise at this point.",1369612800,4,853,4.39873417721519

Thank you, Ms. Harris, for giving him creative liberty with the base of your work as a foundation, and for appreciating him as an artist also. I do not have HBO and have to wait for these videos to come up for purchase in Amazon, which can be agonizing when in need of a Sookie fix. Love to watch them back-to-back. Thank you Amazon!!

7166336,5,B00X7SIALI,"Season 5 of the fantastic HBO series True Blood follows quickly on the heels of Season 4; Sookie has to think fast with a dead Tara in her arms while Bill and Eric are off trying to stake Russell Edgington for good.

In addition to simply furthering the plot, True Blood also raises the stakes to the highest level we have seen on this show. The majority of the season is spent in the underground lair of The Authority, the vampire governing body, and we are introduced to wonderful new characters like Roman and the dangerous Salome. The Authority initially vows to destroy Russell and the threat he poses to all the progress made in human-vampire relations.

As expected, things don't quite turn out the way they are supposed to - and this happens pretty early on. True Blood works best when it is operating within sheer insanity and Season 5 illustrates that beautifully. We get to see the demented fairy nightclub, a fiery Iraqi smoke demon, and an angry vampire goddess throughout the course of 12 episodes that literally fly by.

In addition to all the sheer chaos taking place, Season 5 maintains True Blood's status as a genuine horror TV show. This season is full of truly scary moments, especially because we the audience do not know how powerful these creatures are. How much of a threat can they pose to the characters we love? And what do we have to do to kill them?

What I like best about the season, however, is that it finally addresses the long-waiting issue of how the vampires should deal with their identity. Is mainstreaming a good idea? Is being accepted by society worth compromising who they are, or should they embrace their inherently brutal animalistic vampire selves?

The season finale is a phenomenon on its own, bringing together all the madness without quite wrapping up every loose end. (It'd be too network-television if they did!) The very last cliffhanger in itself is a terrifying moment that undoubtedly dropped jaws across the country. Five seasons strong, True Blood still has plenty of bite.",1369440000,7,2033,4.764204545454546

7166344,5,B00X7SIALI,"I've been a huge fan of True Blood since the first series aired (have not read the books), as it is one of the more original series to come out of the last decade. It is fair to say that series 5 is one of the weaker instalments of the franchise, however a bad episode of True Blood is still better than most things on T.V.

This series is still full of some very interesting story lines, with some great twists and action, especially in Pam's story line which I thought stole the show in this series, however like other reviews have suggested it is still fair to say that some of the other story lines, about the less interesting characters, were not as engaging. However every series has a few ""filler"" story lines and that should not distract from the fact the majority of the season is well scripted and produced staying true to the usual standards of HBO.

I won't start reviewing the different narratives in the series as I feel there is no need, however, if you are a fan of True Blood, ignore the 2 star reviews as they are completely unfair, yes this series is not as good as the other series of True Blood, however it is still a cracking series none the less, offering interesting debates about vampire religion and ethics, still offering us a some what social commentary of the western societies we live in today.",1369353600,,1324,4.422131147540983

7166360,2,B00X7SIALI,I've been a huge fan of the show for years but this season was really bad. The Vampire Authority location shots felt claustrophobic and ended up stranding two of the shows favorite characters away from the rest of the cast for multiple episodes. It felt like showrunners were trying to distance themselves from anything Bill/Sookie/Eric due to the letdown of season 4 that centered on Eric and Sookie. The writers cram as much as they can into each episode giving what feels like about 5 minutes per episode with each character of which there are far too many.,1368662400,4,560,4.724489795918367

The love triangle between Sookie, Bill, and Eric is hardly mentioned. There are only a few scenes that feature the three of them together.

The vampire mythology is interesting but far too much time is spent exploring it. I only watched this season to keep up with the story line, hoping that next season the series will get back on track.",1367798400,15,551,4.680412371134021

I'm gonna go ahead and call seasons 1 through 3 the glory days of True Blood, because after that, things just got a little out of hand. The plots, the acting, the crazy impossible-to-manage amounts of new characters, and the special effects. It's all just SO BAD. I mean, can you guys please go back to season one, the season with A GOLDEN GLOBE, and maybe remember the roots of this once glorious show? I feel like people are so caught up in the absurdities of the newer seasons, that they forget how raw, simple, and genuine the show used to be.

I've lost so much interest. This past Summer, I stopped having crazy anticipation for every Sunday. Sometimes, I would even let it record on the DVR and catch it when it was convenient for me. I stopped blogging about it. I stopped talking about it with friends. I stopped raving about it on Facebook. And now I'm here and I can't even right a proper, critical review.

I just don't care anymore; I've become so indifferent. True Blood is going to have to do a lot of work to gain my interest again. A LOT of work.",1363564800,14,1247,4.3247863247863245

I am very confused as to why some TV seasons are being offered as Blu-Ray & DVD packages. I seems like it should be either you are intelligent & thoroughly enjoy entertainment (blu-ray) or you are stuck in 1999 and probably your trailer as well (DVD).

Sorry about being so gruff but its about time that people stop hurting entetainment and start helping it by moving on to allow for technology advancement & price/cost reduction.

It's great, but it's one of those where you have to learn to shut off your brain and let the weirdness just happen and not analyze the dynamics of everything. A lot of it is absurd and predictable, but the characters are great and the cast is well chosen. Just let yourself get absorbed in the story and you'll enjoy it much more.

Season 5 wasn't the best season so far, but I think a lot of it is setting the stage for something more spectacular next season. I wouldn't skip past it because you can get lost with some of the changes tht happened between characters.

BTW, If it's not too late, the art department should reconsider the box artwork for this season. It's not very appealing for any type of series, but especialy this one. And, it doesn't seem to fit with the style of the previous seasons.",1358899200,16,847,4.3544303797468356

SPOILERS***

Some sub-plots seemed a bit...odd and unnecessary, like the Andy/baby and the Terry/smoke monster storylines. A lot of the Russell Edgington episodes were so gory I had to fast-forward through them. On the upside, the whole ""The Authority"" plot line was really interesting and believable as a ""vampire government"". The most stellar part of Season 5 is the flushing out of some familiar characters (Alcide) and the addition of fantastic new ones (Nora, Salome).

Keep watching!",1357689600,3,746,5.098360655737705
7166396,5,B00X7SIALI,"The Bon Temps gang returns for the fifth season of HBO's ""True Blood"". I am a colossal fan of the show, having seen every episode since the pilot. Like every show, ""True Blood"" has had a few ups and downs in terms of writing. Seasons one and two were the show at its best, in my opinion. Season three was a lot of fun, but suffered from cluttered storylines and tonal problems. But, season four -- although it still can't top season one or two -- was a solid return to form (and I can't understand the bashing it regularly receives on here from other fans).

So, how does season five compare? I found this year to be even better than the last; the most compelling reason for this is the fundamental shaking up of all things comfortable and familiar on the show. All of the close relationships have been compromised or changed or they've grown apart: Sookie/Bill/Eric, Sookie/Tara, Pam/Eric, Jason/Hoyt, Tara/Lafayette, etc. This was the year of the Break Up (friendships as well as romances). But, the interesting thing is how this made way for all sorts of new and compelling bonds to form: Bill/Eric, Pam/Tara, Jason/Jessica.

Season five was definitely a game-changer (probably because it was creator Alan Ball's farewell season). There isn't even a clear-cut Big Bad this year. The villain could be seen as The Authority and through our infiltration of the system this year, we get the sense of just how ambiguous the concepts of right and wrong, good and bad really are to the vampires of the True Blood 'verse. The most compelling part about this story is finally getting to see the inner workings of the Authority and how fundamentally it changes both Bill and Eric (especially toward the latter half of the season). The members of the Authority themselves, though, are a mixed bag. Christopher Meloni proves himself to be the awesome actor he is as Roman, but he's sadly underused during the season. Valentina Cervi didn't really do it for me as Salome, neither did Lucy Griffiths as Eric's vampire sister Nora.

The regular actors, however, were all in top form. It was a refreshing change to see Anna Paquin's Sookie almost entirely unattached romantically. It led for some interesting directions for her character to go in, as well as Ryan Kwanten as Jason (who had what was probably his most powerful arc this year). Stephen Moyer and Alexander Skarsgard reportedly had a blast filming this season and having Bill and Eric be partners in crime instead of foes and competitors for Sookie's heart. This sense of fun really does show and highlights the fact that these two do have great screen chemistry together.

But, my favorite part of this season was the pairing of Pam and Tara. It was a brilliant turn of writing, in many ways. Tara started off as a great and complex character: troubled but also strong, smart, and resourceful, as well as very funny. But, around the time of season three, she became the ""eternal victim"" in a way that was really running out of steam. Having her reborn as a baby vamp really breathed new life into the character and Rutina Wesley did a fantastic job of convincingly reinventing Tara while retaining her essence. Her scenes with Kristin Bauer van Straten were easily some of the best moments of the season, as these two actresses have wonderful chemistry. Kristin also had what was her best season yet, getting able to reveal new dimensions as well as the past of our favorite sardonic vampire Pam.

As great as this season was, it wasn't perfect. My sole criticism for True Blood is that they stop with all of the extra story lines. Not every character needs their own arc on the show. Supporting characters, like Terry, Arlene, and Holly, can remain just that. SUPPORTING characters in the story lines of the more primary ones. Some of the fat I believe could've been trimmed included Terry's Ifrit drama, Holly and Andy's romance, and some of Alcide's wolf pack politics. Even Lafayette (one of my favorites) didn't have much interesting to do this year.

Luckily, by the time of the season finale, the writers did a good job of streamlining most of the stories into one cohesive finish. And what a finish it was! Just wondering what season six has in store for us.",1356998400,205,4217,4.7306122448979595

7166398,3,B00X7SIALI,"I've been a fan of True Blood since the beginning, but this past season has begun to test my loyalty. The seasonal villain is too far-fetched.
