I have other English DVDs I want to watch, so it makes sense for me. Saw most of the movie at Anime Expo (when I still went there) but missed the opening. Getting this DVD allowed me to get the whole picture. Great and tragic story and the narrative doesn't demonize the Soviet occupiers of the Japanese northern islands at the end of World War II. Should get released over here someday, but this release is pretty reasonably priced and looks good. The Russian girl character should be included in lists of top 10 anime heroines.
