Personally I'm not a huge Baby Einstein fan and I rank these about the same with some random Portuguese words thrown in here and there. I'm glad one son has outgrown this stuff, but will use with the baby we have on the way.",1354147200,,286,4.218181818181818
8262596,5,B0016HGHHQ,"My baby loves watching this videos. I bought 4 videos of this collection: Super Baby Music, Super Baby Animals, Super Baby Colors, Super Baby Shapes in Spanish and Portuguese. I am from Brazil and I want to make sure my baby will speak both English and Portuguese languages. The videos are cute and entertaining. I sit to watch the videos with her and she just stares at the TV. I repeat the words for her and I am always telling her what is on the screen. The music is so relaxing that she ends up sleeping. It is a great DVD collection. I love it!",1216339200,,549,4.238095238095238
