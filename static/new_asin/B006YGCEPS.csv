Such awesome, funny and clever writing. I hope it lasts, the premis allows it go alot of different ways. I MUST SEE for sure!!! You will love it...:)",1346889600,,321,4.75
5037016,5,B006YGCEPS,Beautifully written wonderful characters absolutely a must see show. We never miss a show and hope it continues for a long time.,1346457600,2,128,4.863636363636363
5037017,1,B006YGCEPS,"MELISSA MCCARTHY (Molly) is on a role, nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Bridesmaids"" with her character's now well known ugly personality and stomach churning scene. She won an Emmy in 2011 for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her part in ""Mike & Molly,"" and - no surprise here - she's been nominated again in the same category. It just goes to show how demeaning, low brow raunch continues to rule film and television.

And we wonder why people are so quick to confront and fight one another in homes, neighborhoods and businesses. Problem is, real life arenas don't have a laugh track to support them. That way, we'd know it was all in fun to be sneered at - especially in front of others. It might not be film violence breeding crime; it might just be the snappy patter of the well delivered put down putting folks in harm's way.

The first season of this less than spectacular series ended with fat cop Mike (Billy Gardell) proposing to fat teacher Molly. Season Two is about the wedding plans, concluding with the wedding. In just a few minutes into the first of 23 episodes (on three discs), we see how it's going to go. Each scene is loaded with the usual clichs: Molly loves the details of planning the wedding; Mike can't see what the fuss is all about.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends played by Swoosie Kurtz, Louis Mustillo, Reno Wilson and Katy Mixon keep the so-called humor rolling with nasty jokes aimed at the obese. They snipe at each other, too, drawing blood and proving they can be malicious to everyone - part of equal opportunity malevolence found in so many films and TV shows today. Mike and Molly give back some of their own, but mostly take it with a good natured eye roll. Everyone knows fat people learn to laugh at that stuff from pre-school on up, right? It's a survival tool. These two love birds are so used to verbal bullying, they take aim at each other - in a very loving way, of course.

Extras include a gag reel and a ""Mike & Molly Wedding Video,"" where actors glad hand each other, and ""Grandma"" Cleo King exults about getting her Aretha Franklin on to sing at the wedding. The number? ""You Better Stop and Listen to Me,"" an appeal for personal respect from ""The Blues Brothers"" film.

Boy, if only somebody would.",1345939200,4,2281,4.526699029126213
5037018,5,B006YGCEPS,"I just cannot get enough of this show! The season second is just as funny as the first. I have been waiting for a show like this for a long time. This is a TV show were everyone can either relate to one of the characters, or knows someone that can.

Mike and Molly meet at an Overeaters Anonymous meeting were they both are trying to lose weight. After their initial first meeting they're having second thoughts about starting a relationship, but with some pushing from family and friends they decide to give love a chance.

Not only are Melissa McCarthy (Molly) & Billy Gardell (Mike) characters hilarious, but I just love Molly's sister Victoria, and her mother Joyce. Every character on this show brings something extra special, and that's what keeps me laughing, and tuning in every week. The writers of this show are comedic Gods. I hope this show continues for many, more seasons to come!",1336780800,9,894,4.651898734177215
5037019,5,B006YGCEPS,"It is always a treat to discover a situation comedy on broadcast TV with an ensemble cast this strong combined with scripts this great. The writing for Mike & Molly (M&M) relies far more on clever zingers than slapstick (rather in the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B0002W4SX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls</a>, one of my all-time favorite comedies). And though there are plenty of sexual references, the humor maintains a happy medium between gross-out male humor and female-centric, chick-flick comedy, making it a show aimed fairly equally at both men and women.

Every performer on M&M does a wonderful job at comedic acting, an extremely challenging task, and I completely agree with Melissa McCarthy's Emmy win for her portrayal of the female lead, Molly Flynn, a plus-sized fourth-grade teacher living with her boozy mother Joyce (Swoosie Kurtz) and oversexed younger sister Victoria (Katy Mixon). But so many of the actors in this show deserve an Emmy, in my own estimation, that I won't be surprised if in the future other names from the show receive Emmy nominations and/or wins as well.

Season 2 opened on September 26, 2011, and the season finale airs on May 14, 2012. The producer Chuck Lorre also produces the top-rated comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-and-a-Half-Men/dp/B00005JOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two and a Half Men</a>, which M&M follows on CBS. This season offers 23 episodes, one less than last season, but still far more than almost any show on broadcast TV for many years now, where 6-13 shows per season seems to be the norm these days.

M&M is set in Chicago and continues to place its main focus on the romantic relationship of the title characters Molly and her boyfriend Mike Biggs (standup comic, Billy Gardell), who is a beat cop. The two lovers met in Season 1 at an Overeaters Anonymous (OA) meeting. There is a hilarious secondary romance between Joyce and loud-mouthed, crude, and quite lovable Vince Moranto (Louis Mustillo), who hangs out at Molly's house almost as much as Mike. A third, comic romance occurs between Mike's best friend and partner in the police force, Carl McMillan (Reno Wilson), and an eye doctor named Christina (Holly Robinson Peete). In addition, the show's clever writers have provided Carl's grandmother Rosetta (Cleo King) and Mike's mother Peggy (Rondi Reed) with their own romantic misadventures, which are extremely funny. By the way, during Season 1 I formed the opinion that Rondi Reed is one of the most brilliant comic actresses I've ever seen, and that opinion has only solidified this season. Her performance as Mike's mother is right up there, in my personal estimation, with some of Bea Arther's best moments in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maude/dp/B000MGTQ6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maude</a>&nbsp;and The Golden Girls.

I'm glad to report that cafe worker Samuel (Nyambi Nyambi) is a big part of the show again this season, and Peggy's dog, Jim, continues as an adorable contributor to the series. A new addition this season is Francis Guinan, who played the dad of Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-70s-Show/dp/B0058JEHTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That '70s Show</a>, and is cast as Mike's father, who abandoned his family years before and whom Peggy loathes. I won't post any spoilers, but what the writers have done with the relationship between Peggy and her ex was one of the highlights of the season for me, and a great example of Rondi Reed's comic brilliance.

Finally, I must mention the recurring role of Harry, a loveable loser Mike and Molly meet at an OA meeting played by standup comic, David Anthony Higgins (best known for his continuing role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ellen/dp/B0002NY81M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ellen</a>&nbsp;as Joe, the sharp-tongued coffee server in Ellen's bookstore/coffeehouse, a role somewhat similar to Samuel played by Nyambi Nyambi in M&M). Higgins is outstanding as either straight man or comic, whatever a given scene requires.

If you enjoyed Season 1, I guarantee you will be delighted with this season as well. The show is consistently filled with belly laughs, and the characters continue to be as sympathetic and comically compelling as they were in Season 1.",1336521600,13,4513,5.789156626506024
5037020,5,B006YGCEPS,"Another great season.  This show is original and very funny.  The actors are great.  Mikes mother---where did they find this woman.  She is really different and wildly funny.  I just love her.  You start laughing the minute she comes on the screen because you know something unconceivable is going to come out of her mouth.  Mike and Molly are just as cute and funny as they can be.  And I love Mollies mother and sister, what a conglomeration of personalities mixed together.  And lets not forget Mikes partner and his partners grandma.  If you want to see something different, not the same old same old comedy, give this a try and you won't be disappointed.",1333497600,23,659,4.6521739130434785

5037233,5,B006YGCEPS,Great DVD set!!!,1355443200,,16,4.666666666666667
5037234,5,B006YGCEPS,I love the show...and I loved the deal...and look forward to getting season 3 when it becomes available for purchase.,1355270400,,117,4.9
5037235,5,B006YGCEPS,"Thoroughly enjoyable.  Two lovable characters who find each other.  A very uplifting show to watch.  Being a compulsive overeater myself and fighting the battle of the bulge alot of years, it is a pleasure to see a couple who puts that problem in the back of their lives and thoroughloy enjoys living.  A happy couple portrayed by lovable actors with a great cast complimenting each other.  A sure winner.",1355097600,,405,4.811594202898551
5037236,5,B006YGCEPS,"I've watched all the episodes  and I love it.  Even shows that have been previously aired, are always enjoyable.  The characters are different and unique - even Mike's mother's dog.  He's far from a great looking pooch - but he's comical to watch.

I hope Mike and Molly has a long run as it's funny, entertaining, and lovable.",1355011200,,327,4.568965517241379
5037237,5,B006YGCEPS,"It is nice to see a show using people who represent something other than the widely held and oversimplified images to which the ""advertising"" community in America feels we should aspire in everyday roles. As we all know, most of America is not shaped like a model (male or female) in a magazine. This show offers something in the opposite direction, has wit and humor and a cast of supporting role actors with a variety of body shapes; a nice mixture. Good for CBS & ""Mike & Molly""!!!",1354665600,,484,4.511363636363637
5037238,5,B006YGCEPS,THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LOVE TO LAUGH ON A MORE THAN REGULAR BASIS.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED!  GO FOR IT.,1354579200,,127,3.6666666666666665
5037239,4,B006YGCEPS,"much better than season 1, i laughed a lot, i really enjoy that this show  breaks up with standards of beauty, having fat and african american  people as the show stars",1353369600,,168,4.387096774193548
5037240,5,B006YGCEPS,"I started watching Mike and Molly because I saw Melissa McCarthy on Saturday Night Live and then in Bridesmaids and thought I recognized a comic genius. Although she her act is subdued in the TV show, she still displays a finely tuned comedic sensibility. The cast are all good to great and work together well and I find the writing and direction totally entertaining. Funny and often touching, I look forward to season three.",1353024000,,426,4.77027027027027
5037241,5,B006YGCEPS,"A Great show, the actors are well cast, a very funny and entertaining series. Scripts are well written and hilariously well acted.",1352419200,,130,4.954545454545454
5037242,5,B006YGCEPS,Good show and this was an excellent episode! Really enjoyed it. We missed the original broadcast so we were happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon. Highly recommend this episode.,1351123200,2,181,4.6875
5037243,5,B006YGCEPS,very funny. This show is great.  Victoria is so funny.  She always has something to say that cracks me up,1351036800,,105,4.2
5037244,5,B006YGCEPS,I have really enjoyed Mike & Molly since it first aired.  The acting is great and the writing is funny and natural.  It is nice that they were able to feature characters that have less than perfect backgrounds and less than perfect lives that we all can relate to on one level or another.  If people gave the show a try I think that most people would love it.  This show and Big Bang Theory are the comedy staples in our house!,1349654400,,427,4.170731707317073
5037245,5,B006YGCEPS,"I absolutely love this show! Each episode brings more laughs, you fall in love with the whole cast!  I can't wait for season 3!!",1349654400,,128,4.333333333333333
5037246,5,B006YGCEPS,This show is hysterical. I have purchased  both seasons and just loaned my boss the season 2 DVD to see the wedding before she watched the honeymoon this year. The characters are all funny and work off of each other in a believable manner. Reminds me of My Big Fat Greek Wedding as you can see someone from your family in this crazy cast of characters.,1348617600,,352,4.333333333333333
5037247,5,B006YGCEPS,"This is a wonderful sitcom that shows that there is life for full figured men and women. After watching shows such as Cheers, where a good-looking hunk like Sam Malone romances beautiful blonde Diane Chambers, we have not seen any show that relates to full figured people. I think this is a wonderful love story produced by television's most successful creator Chuck Lorre (who also created Grace under Fire, Cybil, Dharma & Greg, Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory.)

In this season, lot of changes occurs in the lives of Mike and Molly. Mike moves out of his bachelor pad and moves in with Molly and a house full of women. Mike's buddy and a fellow police officer, Carl meets a beautiful girl Christina (Holly Robinson Peete) who becomes a series regular. In the last episodes of this season, Mike and Molly get married, and in fact this is one of the best stories of the season. Episodes such as; ""Happy Halloween,"" ""Denis's Birthday,"" and Valentine's Piggyback"" are some of the hilarious stories.

The Keb' Mo's recording of ""I See Love"" (Suitcase), a song co-written with Josh Kelley, serves as a wonderful theme song for the show with Chicago's downtown in the backdrop. This part of the show is very refreshing and simply beautiful. The role of Molly played by actress Melissa McCarthy is certainly a beautiful woman to watch.

5037248,5,B006YGCEPS,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Mike & Molly"" is absolutely hilarious, no-holds-barred comedy, and this second season is as golden as the first one.  All the way around, its acting  and writing continue to walk the fine line between classy liberal punchlines and insulting farce.  I think of it as a modern ""Married...With Children"" with an extended family theme thrown in for good measure.  I love the show, but I wonder why its makers didn't give us an option for  Blu-Ray buying for Season Two when they did for Season One.  I hear the criticism coming that the demand for Blu-Ray may not have been large enough to warrant a second season released on the high definition disc format.  I'm simply saying it's an odd switch.

A great cast, including Melissa McCarthy, Billy Gardell, Rondi Reed, and Swoosie Kurtz,is always sharp.  Also, look for Reginald Veljohnson(Carl Winslow from ""Family Matters"") in a later episode this season.  Overall, ""Mike & Molly"" is one of the best comedies on modern television and the basic high quality of its second season should be recommendation enough for its purchase.",1347926400,,1092,4.945054945054945
5037249,5,B006YGCEPS,Very funny and awesome show. The whole cast are just hilarious and I could watch each episode over and over again and I haven't loved a show this much since Friends so that's how good it is. And the Bloopers are so funny I could watch a whole disc worth if I could. So I highly recommend You buy the DVD so You can enjoy it as much as I did,1347062400,,340,3.8028169014084505
