But if you don't want to shell out $40 for the far superior official first season release, these six eps serve as an interesting appetizer. OSB hit the airwaves six months before the universally known Twilight Zone (a friend of mine, in Africa to photograph wildlife, found the clerk at his inn reading The TZ Companion, by Marc Zicree), but it is far less known, and seemingly, far less respected. This is confusing, as they are two completely different programs, and so they are not in competition - OSB was based on true stories, and the host and director of the show, John Newland, more than once brought onto camera the individual to whom the events had occurred. John himself is almost ghost-like, as he rambles in and out of the edges of each episode; you get the strong impression that he is one inch from smiling, shrugging and tilting his head at the camera, as though to say, ""Don't laugh at this stuff...you may be next."" Then the creepiest music in the world, the black and white harshness - just eerie, all around. The best ep on this DVD, IMO, is ""Brainwave"", with George Grizzard as a n'er-do-well navy man, ordered to operate on his critically injured CO. He's taking instruction through a speaker from another ship, when the other ship is hit by enemy fire...without giving too much away, Grizzard finishes the surgery, with some extremely out of this world assistance. ""Delusion"" is worth watching for the lovely Suzanne Pleshette, and ""Doomsday"" really seems like an urban tale, but I have some European connections, and we have heard about this specific story many, many times. The other eps are average, but TZ had average ones, too. Give it a chance, and you'll become a fan - watch for the official releases, which are FINALLY starting after 50 years!!!!!!",1285372800,3,1968,4.674351585014409
