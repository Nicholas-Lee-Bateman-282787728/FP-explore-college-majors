3889763,5,B002AMVEK6,"This is my first time watching a medical tv series. This being my first view of the concept, i liked it. It has good actors, with a good story with Jada Pinkett Smith and Micheal Vartan. It has its funny moments which makes part of this story good. Character lead Christina Hawthorne (jada)has a hard time after her husband's death. Being a mom and a full time nurse takes a toll on her. In each episode there's a medical issue, leading to a dramatic confilct with some humor in the mix, but some sad moments. I love how the nurses take care for their patients and how serious Hawthorne takes her patients; with concern and compassion. Episode #9 really touched me becuase it had one of the most heartbreaking moments within the show. I just strated watching season two on TNT and i love it. I hope it continues a third season.",1277856000,,827,4.447368421052632
3889764,1,B002AMVEK6,"I ordered this DVD set from Amazon and when it arrived, it was supposed to be 3 DVD's, but I got 2 Disc 1's and 2 Disc 2's and NO disc 3...They sent out a replacement and that set had the SAME problem. They took it off the site for a week and now it's back up as only containing ONE DVD...I don't know if it's the shipment Amazon got or not, but beware...",1277856000,2,355,3.810810810810811
3889765,5,B002AMVEK6,This has become my favorite show. Jada is awesome. All my friends know not to call me when Hawthorne is on.,1277510400,2,107,4.142857142857143
3889766,5,B002AMVEK6,"Season 2 starts tonight (6/22/2010):  Why is it not available for Pre-Ordering of a season pass?  Season 1 Awesome, and I know Season 2 (maybe more seasons to come) will be just as awesome, I want TNT/Sony Pictures to know that I am willing to purchase future seasons (3-beyond), as a loyal customer to Amazon.com and loyal viewer of the show!!",1277164800,,344,4.622950819672131
3889767,2,B002AMVEK6,"I have nothing but respect for Jada Pinkett as an actress, but this show sucks, I don't know how it lasted one whole season.  I watched one episode and barely made it through.  If you work in the medical field you will know that her actions are senseless and not in the best interest of the patient. If you don't work in the medical field then you will know this show really doesn't make any sense.  I hope Jada pinkett can get some more roles like she had in the 90's but this is far form those.",1276560000,4,496,4.092783505154639
3889768,5,B002AMVEK6,"I was skeptical when I purchased the first episode but this series quickly won me over.  I've watched every episode now and will be sad when the season ends.  As an actress, Jada Pinkett Smith sometimes lacks range in her character portrayals.  She's the strong cocky female character.  Even when she comes across more as Jada, than Hawthorne, the script is so strong it overshadows those momentary lapses.  I certainly hope they've had enough viewership for another season.  We've all seen several hospital dramas over the years, but this one centers more on the personal lives of the doctors ala Grey's Anatomy minus heavy emergency room environment.  I'm really impressed. I did not expect to like this show so much.",1251158400,5,719,4.941666666666666
3889769,5,B002AMVEK6,Jada is awesome. The trailer is exciting and I can't wait to carve out time in my Tuesday schedule to watch Hawthorne.,1248307200,3,118,4.409090909090909
3889770,5,B002AMVEK6,"I agree with Chris Caldara's suggestion that ""St. Elsewhere"" was ""the template for all future television medical dramas""1. which changed how we perceived life behind the doors of a city hospital.  The fragility of life exposed in ""St. Elsewhere"" took a gigantic leap forward in ""ER"", producing perhaps THE best television medical drama of our time.  Now comes ""HawthoRNe"", a new story told from the perspective of a Chief Nursing Officer.  I have followed this show from concept write-ups to TNT cable promotion, and I believe ""HawthoRNe"" to be the next BIG hit for the medical drama genre. Created by John Masius, whose other credits include ""Touched By An Angel"" and ""Providence"", and starring Jada Pinkett Smith, who heads a strong supporting cast, I have high hopes for ""HawthoRNe"", and anxiously await its DVD release !!!

3889786,5,B002AMVEK6,"This series would do well no matter what perspective these actors came from.  In this case it's a hospital.  I really liked Grey's anatomy but this show will give it a run for the money.  The actors are all attractive but ""real"".  These are people you wouldn't be surprised to find at your local hospital.

I expect it will win a lot of awards because the special interest stories it tackles are relevant and elegantly portrayed.  If real life played out like the show life would be easier to manage.

Anyway, from my perspective, I give this ""rave"" reviews.  It's great.",1410393600,,571,4.584158415841584

3889797,1,B002AMVEK6,"Hollow--wood depiction is just that: fantasy scenarios geared to tug at the heart strings while falsely portraying heroes that care. This woman's portrayal of a chief nursing officer is all wrong: actual chief nursing officers and hospital administrators are NOT directly involved with patient care or patient case scenarios. Quite the opposite. And the average age of a floor RN (registered nurse) is 46 years of age----not one character in this series represents this population accurately.  Plus, this series portrays nurses as having time to spend with their patients---which is SO NOT TRUE!!!  Not one episode deals with nurse-patient ratio overloads, which is the main reason behind health care and medication administration errors, and patient injury/demise. And who is to blame for over-burdening nurses with humongous patient loads? Chief Nursing Officers and Hospital administrators---who do the usual: very little when it comes to patient care or safety; their time and effort is spent on pursuing nurses: looking for what nurses are failing to do rather than supporting what nurses do correctly or taking action to ensure nurses are able to perform optimally; they are punitive, not supportive. And the public wrongfully stereotypes hospitals and nursing persons based on phony shows like this. If ever there was a show that honestly depicted the reality of hospitals and hospital employees---it would be headed under 'horror' not 'drama'.",1408233600,8,1451,5.444444444444445

It is about what really is happening in the international spyworld.  It, of course, has one main story about how our smartest people in the top secret world of deciphering other nations secret communications, do their jobs.  Underlying, is the story of how our own spies cooperate with other nations spies to create a new world with one political system of oversight.

3889847,1,B002AMVEK6,I was so excited for this series.  It was an opportunity to raise up the nursing profession and instead it drags it down.  Christina Hawthorne exploits her previous relationship with MD to colleague to play judge and jury of the healthcare system.  Once again sex gets you whatever you want/need.  That is not real nursing.,1378944000,,323,4.818181818181818
3889848,5,B002AMVEK6,Jada pinkett smith does a great job in this high paced ER show. It focuses on nursing and the relationships in the medical office. Highly recommended.,1376956800,,150,4.8076923076923075
3889849,5,B002AMVEK6,"I was late watching this show because my cable provider did not carry it. By the time I was able to watch it; it was cancelled.

3889850,3,B002AMVEK6,It's good but you see one show you've seen them all. The show is more or less the same All the time,1375574400,,99,3.5454545454545454
3889853,5,B002AMVEK6,Very dramatic but my wife and I love it. Very good entertainment. Glad we were able to our prime status. We will be looking forward to the next season of Hawthorne.,1375056000,2,164,4.32258064516129

3889857,2,B002AMVEK6,"I started watching this series on the recommendation of a friend.  I watched 2 or 3 episodes and just became bored with the whole series.  I like the medical drama aspect of the show, but the characters come off as flat, and they failed to keep me interested with their story lines.",1370908800,,282,4.403846153846154
3889858,4,B002AMVEK6,Good and entertaining. Keeps your interest though I think the lack of advertising killed the shows progression. Good pass time show.,1370390400,,132,5.333333333333333
3889859,3,B002AMVEK6,The series started out good but lost some of it's draw for me towards the end.  Don't know if I would have kept watching if it went beyond two seasons.,1368403200,,151,4.033333333333333
3889860,5,B002AMVEK6,I watched the Hawthorne series on TV and I loved the show.  There are a few episodes that I missed and now I get to see them.  This show makes you and makes you cry.  The show depicts a lot of real-life and contraversal scenarios.,1367452800,,230,4.066666666666666

3889879,3,B002AMVEK6,A nurse Jackie want to be not done as well at all.  I only got through 2 shows the lead character is over acting big time.  Would watch if there wasn't anything better on but there is plenty that is better,1360713600,,205,3.975609756097561

3889894,5,B002AMVEK6,"Amazon suggested this show for me over and over again, and I kept thinking it wasn't for me. But about three months ago I felt a nudge and watched one ep. I was really surprised, I loved it! It's a great twist on a old story line, with a mega star,Jada, whom I was wishing to see on the big screen really really soon. To see her in this role shows a whole new side of her, she's wonderful. I was never bored, and the show stayed fesh. I was worried when they switched hospitals but it worked. It's never easy for me to find a show that I can dig into, the last one was Medium, but there's room for another. I've now seen every esp on amazon and it's worth it every cent.",1315008000,,670,3.9703703703703703
3889895,5,B002AMVEK6,"Wow! What a *GREAT* show.
The show is great for all you ER and Grey's
Anatomy lover's. There's never a dull moment in Hawthorne.
Jada shows just how women multi-task on a daily
basis, just to get the job done. I just wished
that they would put more episodes in a season
than 10. Other than that everything is *Great*
it's about time Jada is back on the set, she's
been gone for a while!!!!!",1312934400,,390,4.213333333333333
3889896,5,B002AMVEK6,"This show really shows off Jada's personality. Jada is feisty and this show lets her express that. Also, Michael Vartan is one of my favorite actors and he is in this show - which gives me just enough reason to watch it :P. If you want a show with great actors, fantastic dialog, and will keep you on your toes, you should DEFINITELY buy this. :)",1302566400,,346,4.257575757575758
3889897,5,B002AMVEK6,"Jada Pinkett Smith is what brought me to the show and it's Nurse Hawthorne that has kept me coming back for more week after week.  I love that the show is from a nurse's view and that she will go to great lengths to get the best care for her patients.  For too long medical dramas only care about the five or so minutes that doctors spend with people and totally ignored the backbone of our medical profession  --- nurses.  We should all be so lucky to have a Nurse Hawthorne stepping up to plate for us and demanding we all get the best medical treatment no matter our lot in life. In the last two years I have met some great nurses who took care of me during my multiple long stays in the hospital and I can't express my upmost respect that I have for them and their profession.

Once, I received my HawthoRNe dvd I watched it over and over and over.  Now I am waiting on Season 2 dvd to be finally released and Season 3 in June 2011.

Long Live HawthoRNe!!!",1298419200,,960,4.129032258064516

3889900,5,B002AMVEK6,"This is actually the first hospital drama show, I ever sat down and watched. I saw the previews leading up to it, and wanted to give it a try. I love the show, the characters, the plots, and how well it keeps you wanting more. By the end of the first season, I was totally hooked, and looking forward to the second season. When I found out season 1 was on DVD, I was thrilled, and when season 2 comes out I'll be getting that one as well. I think its a very well written show, with great acting, which draws you in, and you feel what the characters feel at times. You gotta love hopsital drama, lol and this show by far, is very entertaining.",1282608000,,642,4.103174603174603

3889902,5,B002AMVEK6,"I ended up watching a few episodes from my friends DVD and after the first 2 I was hooked.  I gave her the disks back and went and bought my own set.  I just loved the characters and the plot is great.  Jada has always been a good actor and should get more roles, she is simply phenomenal.  I love Ray and Isabel helps make the show.  But, Dr. Wakefield, totally has me hooked. That man can act and he is simply beautiful.

8359847,5,B002AMVEK6,"This was my favorite season of HawthoRNe! Jada's character is ruthless, unapologetic, and fierce when it comes to defending her patients and what is right for them. I love this about ""Nurse HawthoRNe"". Suleka Matthew's character was a nice compass when Christina HawthoRNe needed to be reigned in. Michael Vartan is a sexy love interest who plays the role in a straight forward way. It was a wonderful show!
