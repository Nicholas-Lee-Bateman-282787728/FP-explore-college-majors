3905482,4,B002C8YSH4,"I don't really understand this. This is a really good family film but a poor release in 3D. I know most are moving to the blu ray 3D (Or so it seems with so many reviews by people who don't own a 3D tv) As far as a movie overall, this is a great family tale done very well and the actors did a wonderful job bringing it to the big screen. The downfalls are that the 3D transfer really suffered. The near screen effects were brought out too far and that broke up in anaglyph. as far as the far field scenery it was beautiful being able to see the far mountains and forest scenes. Not put together well. Still, A great classic story and some good 3D scenes make this a decent movie to pass by for 3D fans. In 2D it holds up as a very good family film as me and my daughter love watching it.",1295481600,3,788,3.93125
3905483,2,B002C8YSH4,Just a repeat of the same old lonely misunderstood kid perseveres over the odds and makes good plot.  I got it for the 3D which was poor and difficult to watch.  Way overpriced.,1281225600,,177,4.333333333333333
3905484,1,B002C8YSH4,"Bought it on 3D DVD as it was the only family movie with 3D. Everything else in 3D is either horror rated R movies or documentary.

There is nothing that attracts viewer's attention in this movie. Just some very slow developing plot about some wolf-dog hybrid. Too slow, nothing is really happening. Even children could not watch it - so boring. They usually watch every movie otherwise. Waste of time. Can't really tell any more than that because I could not sit through the end.

3D image quality is bad, not realistic, Final Destination 3D was better.",1268438400,2,554,4.701030927835052
3905485,4,B002C8YSH4,I have noted in the last few years it seems that about the only films that are being release is loaded with graphic horror and bloodletting while the need for family fare is almost none existence. Well this film is a good family film. The story in itself strays from Jack London's story but it does give you the sense of adventure needed to spur the imagination of the young and old alike.,1264204800,8,389,4.342465753424658
3905486,5,B002C8YSH4,"This was one of the best movies that I had seen. Great acting, beautiful scenery and great looking wolf. This new movie version also features within it the story of the original ""Call of the Wild"" using the same wolf.  Highly recommended.",1262304000,8,238,4.666666666666667
8363745,2,B002C8YSH4,I'm not able to watch the movie in 3D. I can watch in 2 D tho.,1516233600,,62,2.9375

8363747,5,B002C8YSH4,"Excellent adaptation of the Jack London story, with the plot twist of having a girl rather than a boy playing the main character. Would be a good film for kids in that difficult pre-teen phase, when parents want to offer them adventure but also good values, without a lot of violence. Kids will enjoy the story and the dogs, while adults will enjoy the great script and great acting.",1423958400,,383,4.565217391304348

8363751,3,B002C8YSH4,"Now I clearly remember watching a version of Call of the Wild released in the early 90's with my family.  We all treasured that movie and considered it one of the most emotionally impactful movies of all-time.  While scanning amazon for Call of the Wild movies, I see that now there's more than one- there's at least 4 different ones.  I suppose the one I saw in the 90's was the original and is hopefully widely considered the best (edit- no, the original is from 1972 and I've never seen that one- thanks google!).

This Call of the Wild?  Nowhere *near* the best.  In fact, it's barely interesting enough to keep me watching until its conclusion due to *really* weak writing.

Perhaps over the years I somewhat lost an emotional attachment to such movies involving children forming a bond with an animal, or maybe this film is just a really inferior and cliched version of the same old storyline I've seen countless times, but this movie is seriously average at best.  A little girl moves to Montana with her grandfather (played by Christopher Lloyd) and ultimately competes in a sled dog racing tournament with an older man and his smoking dimwitted no good son.  Of course these two make up the bad guys of the movie.  They aren't even *that* bad anyway- more like the father has a serious sore loser attitude towards everyone in town.

Oh and the race itself is VERY boring.  I mean if you're going to spend a considerable amount of time building up to a dramatic finish, at least have the decency to make it worthwhile.  This race is clearly nothing memorable.  I had to chuckle when the police officer lady said ""This dog's too wild- we're gonna have to take him to the pound"" RIGHT after he wags his happy tail, haha.

Another problem is that half of the stuff that makes up the plot is total fluff.  A little girl moves to Montana from Boston and has to become acclimated to a new wild outdoors environment.  She spends most of her time taking care of the dog in the garage and convincing her grandfather why she should keep the dog.  Other times she ventures around town (such as the diner) and meets the teenagers that live there.  Overall however, it's not interesting enough storytelling to leave me feeling satisfied.

I think the problem is that this Call of the Wild film is intended for kids- that's why it feels so predictable and uninspiring from my adult point of view.  Not trying to sound arrogant or anything right there, if it sounds like I am.  This is a kid's movie.  I don't hate it however- the 3-star rating stands because children might enjoy the bond between an adorable girl and a wolf/dog and probably won't recognize everything that makes up the storyline is average at best.  But for me and most adults, we've seen this stuff before in superior films over the years so my recommendation is to avoid this version of Call of the Wild and seek out the one from the early 90's.",1374019200,,2909,4.539347408829174
8363752,4,B002C8YSH4,"We had seen this movie on Hallmark so I ordered it to watch with my grandchildren.  It is a nice movie.  I liked the relationship between the grandfather and the little girl, and being animal lovers, we always enjoy this type of movie.",1370476800,,235,4.441860465116279

8363754,1,B002C8YSH4,Paint by numbers made for TV quality movie with lackluster plot and acting. The 3D does not serve the story. Hard to keep interested when I can watch Nickelodeon or The Disney Channel and see better.,1333584000,,199,4.555555555555555
