5661742,5,B00BO98QOS,"It's Vincent Price, and well, how can you go wrong !  He put his heart and soul into every single role he played.  The Gothic Horror tales contained here are complete with period clothing, furniture, lighting and color !  Some are are fun, others thought provoking, and I thank Mr. Price for leaving us with so many great films. Wonderful for any collection that demands this type of horror genre - in the style of Hammer.",1437523200,19,422,4.526315789473684

Yes, some of his older movies are a little corny but, as always, he pulls it off with his dark, off beat ,self !!!!  If your a fan of his this set is one you'll want for your collection. Once again, a smooth ,courteous and Quick transaction. Thank You. :  )",1421798400,3,353,4.2388059701492535

5661751,5,B00BO98QOS,"All I can say is when the name Vincent Price is listed I make sure to buy the movie. Serious folks, I like Mr. Price, it's too bad he has passed away, but he has left his fans his movie classics to enjoy. Some people like a painting by Picasso, or a Rembrandt or Andy Warhol, with me Vincent Price is a true artist--a master of the horror film genre--and I love all his movies. Some of my favorites include Theater of Blood, Masque of the Red Death and of course Dr. Phibes series. My collection is growing, I recommend this seller to those of you who like Horror films by Vincent Price...may he rest in peace. The delivery was first rate, 2-day on time. Very happy with this purchase.",1504742400,,685,4.276923076923077

5661753,3,B00BO98QOS,"For the money, this is a decent set of Vinny Price flicks. However, I should have read the fine print at the bottom of the description noting that these are DVD-R's, not DVD's. I did see that it was 6 movies on 3 discs, but I thought one movie would be on each side of each disc. That's not the case here. Two movies are on one side of each disc, which means the video and audio transfers are compressed.

Overall, the quality isn't bad, but there are other collections out there that are better, albeit for more money than this set.",1501113600,6,533,4.2254901960784315

8571885,4,B00BO98QOS,".... arrived promptly and in good condition ...6  movies on 3 one sided discs .. Personally I prefer this over two-sided discs...  I hate two sided discs ..  decent  audio and video ...  personally I purchased  this mostly for the three Roger Corman directed movies .. Scream and Scream Again  being the least favorite out of the six movies .. The three Corman directed movies are More than worth the price of admission ...  if you are a Vincent Price fan and you don't already own these these movies this Collection is well worth it....  You should be aware though that there are No extras,not even subtitles ...",1525478400,,613,4.601851851851852

Just sat and ate popcorn while enjoying Vincent ham it up. The Red Death and Pit and the Pendulum are must see flicks. The Dr Phibes movies are great fun, very much over the top hamminess.",1518652800,,343,4.548387096774194
