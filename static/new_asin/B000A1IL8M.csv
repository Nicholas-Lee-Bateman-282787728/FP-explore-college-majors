2349199,5,B000A1IL8M,"I thought this DVD was very good, especially if you are a horse fan. It took a young girl blessed with knowledge for horses and goes to show how far adults will go to intimidate a little girl, and cheat in the sport of horse racing in order to ruin the sport. The DVD was recommended to me by my Mom, who has taught me most everything I know about horses.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Horse-for-Danny/dp/B000A1IL8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Horse for Danny</a>",1174867200,21,511,5.64935064935065
2349200,1,B000A1IL8M,"Those who have seen Horse for Danny and those who haven't.  When I used to work at a video store, we used to have bets on who could get someone to rent this movie.  I could never pull it off in the four years I was there, but my friend and co-worker, Clerk, did.  Once.

This is BAD.  As in snuffing out your brain cells, bad.  Avoid this.

Why did I buy it?  Why, Clerk got married.  Can you think of a better wedding present for Mr. and Mrs. Clerk?",1168041600,5,450,3.911111111111111

2349203,5,B000A1IL8M,"We first learned about this movie because a couple at church loaned it to us.  After seeing it, we knew we had to own it because it is a great family movie that the children love and enjoy over and over.  It's hard to find clean, family shows, so I was so happy to find this one.",1272758400,2,279,3.8771929824561404
2349204,5,B000A1IL8M,"Film about a racehorse and a young girl 10 to 12.  Young actress delivered a believeable character.  Story of father (horse trainer)raising child alone, wife deceased.  Great acting compared to junk on
current market today.  Bought it for a pre-teen whose dad is big on
horses.",1269302400,2,277,4.956521739130435
2349205,4,B000A1IL8M,"This is a great older movie for kids. I've owned it since I was 7 and I'll still pop it in the vhs player and watch it. It's a nice movie about a girl that has an amazing knowledge about horses, her uncle who's fallen on hard times and is still dealing with the death of his brother, and some people who will do anything to try to intimidate the girl who's seen promise in a difficult colt that's never won a race. Robert Urich does a great job with the acting. The movie has a happy ending and it would be something that any horse loving kid would like to watch.",1259625600,4,563,4.035714285714286

2349207,5,B000A1IL8M,A Horse For Danny  is a really good family movie. Robert Urich was a great actor. This movie shares some good life lessons. It's not the conventional story of a traditional family that lives happily ever after. There are a few challenges along the way - and more to come.,1245456000,5,271,4.42
2349208,5,B000A1IL8M,"I LIKE THE MOVIE, BUT I AM PREJUDICED. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET DVDs OF MOVIES IN WHICH I APPEARED, SINCE I AM ALMOST 86 YEARS OLD AND LONG RETIRED AND I HOPE TO LEAVE SOMETHING FOR MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN SO THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT I OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONVEY. THOUGH I WOULD NOT YIELD TO MY AGENT'S DESIRE THAT I GO TO HOLLYWOOD, I MANAGED TO GET SOME WORK. HOLLYWOOD DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME, AND I LIKE MY LIFE WHERE I AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN SOME MOVIES I HAD THE LEAD ROLE, BUT IN MOST I WAS A MINOR FIGURE. BUT I ENJOYED IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  ED GRADY",1240790400,6,592,3.8925619834710745
2349209,4,B000A1IL8M,"Good family movie and just as enjoyable for Grandma,Mom, and grandaughter. LeeLee was  a good actress even when she was about 12 years old.  Robert Urich  will always be a joy to watch.  Story was about a horse trainer and his niece trying to keep afloat in a tough business.  LeeLee sees a horse she believes has what it takes to be a winner and begs and pleads until her uncle gives in and claims the horse after a race. The previous owners didn't want to lose the horse and they try to get the horse back. A real ""feel good"" movie.",1215993600,14,534,4.196078431372549

8072059,5,B000A1IL8M,"My middle daughter discovered this movie on TV when she was a kid and we watched it together. We also rented it ""back in the day"" when you had to go to the store to rent VHS tapes. Can't even tell you how many times we watched it! I surprised her with the dvd for Christmas this year and, at the ""ripe old age"" of 29, she was thrilled beyond belief to receive it! It's still a wonderful film and if you have a horse crazy girl in your family, buy her this movie!!",1388102400,,463,3.9361702127659575
8072060,4,B000A1IL8M,"Not a bad little horse piece, and pretty safe for children (as long as you don't object to a few gambling themes).

This was a fairly low-budget movie, so there are no slick special effects. Horse movies shouldn't need them, either! There are still some lovely shots of Thoroughbreds doing what they do best: run their hearts out. Horse lovers (and racing lovers) will think this is great; the general public might not. Those who like this movie will keep liking it and those who hate it probably won't change their minds. The cinematography is straightforward and will look dated by now, but this isn't a deal-breaker for me. The scripting isn't awful, but not especially edgy or clever (in other words, rather ""middle ground"" among horse films). The music is pleasant, though a bit repetitive (again, probably due to the modest budget). As a child, I personally thought the plotting in this movie was actually pretty original and a somewhat gentle way to give children insights about the dark side of the glittering world of horse racing (without actually getting horrendously bleak - after all, it has a perfectly happy ending). Someone else will always disagree, though. People need to remember two things when considering movies: the intended audience (children's movies are seldom done in the same style as non-children's movies) and the filming techniques of the time when the movie was made (in this case, 1995 will be quite foreign to those who weren't yet alive or those who are expecting every movie in the world to be thrill-a-minute action/horror/mystery).

I've always thought that Leelee Sobieski has a very distinctive appearance and acting method, and this was clear even in this 1995 work. Considering she was only about 12 when this movie was made, she's not bad (many people think her first screen appearance was in ""Jungle 2 Jungle,"" ""Deep Impact,"" or the ""Joan of Arc"" miniseries, but that's simply not true). Minor flaws in the dialogue (hollow lines) are the problem of the scripting, not the actors.

In general, I have no particular opinion about Robert Urich (I'm merely unfamiliar with him), but he's a strong casting choice in this case and is a good way to tie the rest of the cast together.",1378166400,,2221,4.885941644562334
8072061,5,B000A1IL8M,"I saw this movie on tv many years ago.
As a memorable movie that stuck in my mind for many years,
glad to see it could be purchased on DVD.
  good investment.",1366416000,,158,3.90625
8072062,5,B000A1IL8M,This is a great movie and good for the whole family.  Danny was quite a little buisness woman.  And won in the end.  Really enjoyed it!,1335139200,,135,4.115384615384615
8072063,5,B000A1IL8M,"This was a wonderful movie. It is definitely one I would recommend for families. I appreciate movies that don't encourage the use of vulgarity. I will watch it again and again alone and with friends, that's how much I like it.",1322438400,,226,4.536585365853658
