1656235,5,B00005RIY5,"I never thought I would be so addicted to a show as I am to Queer As Folk. Showtime did a marvelous job making the British miniseries into a weekly soap opera. I think most everyone can connect with some facet of the personalities of all the characters, and can relate to the story line in one way or another. I taped the episodes as they aired, but will be thrilled when the DVDs come in the mail - I've already almost worn the tapes out replaying episodes for all my friends to see. And this price is by far the best I've seen anywhere, so congrats go to Amazon for snatching this opportunity and offering an excellent DVD set at a great price.",1005264000,,646,4.217741935483871
1656236,3,B00005RIY5,"I am sorry but I have to agree... the UK version has little to do with this one. I never understood why the really fast and extremelly videoclip-like original HAD to be stretched this way so that more episodes could be produced... boring most of the time and really lost most of its initial impact along the way. The actors are no longer ""normal-looking"" men who just happen to be gay but are portrayed as most str8 people see gays...and then again you HAD to have more female actors, less drugs, more of the gay & lesbian activism stuff and surely much less of the ""age issue"" to get away in the States! And the music... where has all the trashy dance stuff gone??? If you really want to see the first really revolutionary TV series get hold of the original!",1005177600,4,759,4.390070921985815
1656237,5,B00005RIY5,"The DVD set is a dream come true for me.  I have watched every episode of Queer As Folk and have never been disappointed.  Which explains why I want the first season on DVD.  I have heard that the British version is better- and it might be to some people- but I think this is such a huge step for cable Tv in America because there has never been a show about gay society that shows ALL aspects of what a group of gay friends might go through.  I am not very good with words so I hope people understand that I am trying to say that this show is awesome.  It keeps me watching.  The actors, writers, and producers are wonderful and I thank them for bringing the characters and the show to life.",1004486400,7,692,4.088888888888889
1656238,5,B00005RIY5,"This is an exceptional show, and for all those gay or straight take the time to watch it, it's wonderful. I'm a heterosexual female and I LOVE the show. Granted there are some pretty intense sex scenes but the story and dialogue is unlike anything I've ever seen! The talent on the show is amazing Gale Harold is going to be famous and Hal Sparks is amazing so is Peter Paige. I can't single out certain people in the cast because everyone is so good! If you haven't seen the show see it! Set aside your petty sexual differences and watch one episode I guarantee you will enjoy what you see!",1004486400,2,591,4.333333333333333
1656239,5,B00005RIY5,"This show is the best on television.  I am not gay, but it really addresses a very wide range of social issues, while not being preachy at all.  The dialogue thorughout the entire first season was incredible and consistent with the words I hear on an every day basis (odd that a typical day receives an NC-17 rating)  Sure there are some graphic scenes in this show, but they are actually central to it.  This beautiful piece of art is a must have that I reccomend to everyone, even homophobes.",1004400000,8,494,4.455555555555556
1656240,2,B00005RIY5,"I'ts unfortunate if you've seen the original (British) version of this soap.  Our cousins had cuter actors, more sex scenes, and a faster-paced script.  At times in the US version I found myself looking at the clock as the melodrama dragged on.  But... it's a start for more frank TV here in America.  Let's see more and better follow-ups.",1003536000,6,339,4.694915254237288

1656351,5,B00005RIY5,"First off, I must add that I did enjoy watching Queer As  Folk The Complete First Season and truthfully felt compelled to order it due to this being under a show that is about PR. I laugh now as I admit that I was expecting something like a modern day version of Mad Men and/or Scandal when it comes to the representation of public relations.  The show still turned out to be good and I was pleasantly surprised to hear some songs that I have previously enjoyed listening to even before I heard of, purchased, and watched the show.  The show centers around the characters of Brian, Justin, Michael, Emmett, Ted, Lindsay, Melanie, Debbie, and Vic. It is a messy yet interesting love scenario due to the fact that Justin is intensely in love with Brian. However, Brian is in no rush to give his heart completely to anyone. For instance, Michael has known Brian for much longer than Justin and even he has more of a platonic friendship with Brian.  Lindsay and Melanie are truly in love with each other, and at the same time Melanie feels frustrated at times with the relationship dynamic between Lindsay and Brian.  Michaels mother Debbie is highly compassionate and a surrogate mother to the rest of Michaels entourage: Brian, Justin, Michael, Emmett, Ted, Lindsay, and Melanie. Debbie is also close with her brother Vic is not afraid to hold the truth back when needed and yet still offer constructive advice.  Emmett is sometimes naturally concerned about Ted being taken advantage of in the romance department and is also not afraid to hold back his concerns with Ted.  Michael has to contend with his romantic feelings/and slight but harmless jealousy of the  dynamic between Justin and Brian while making sure to be a good  partner to Dr. David Cameron.  Justin opens his heart tremendously to Brian while also tactfully handling a complicated friendship with his supportive friend Daphne. This edition of Queer As Folk: The Complete First Season comes with six discs and extras such as previews of what the next episode holds, episode summaries, Hal Sparks introducing deleted scenes (disc 6), behind the scenes outtakes, meet the folk-biographies, interviews of characters, actors, and production team, season 2 sneak peek, trailers, photo gallery, dvd-rom features with weblink and exclusive content.",1418342400,2,2307,4.953367875647668
1656352,4,B00005RIY5,"Watched this series on Netflix and fell in love. I knew I just had to have it. Only had a few scratches on a couple cds, but nothing a little cd cleaner can't fix. Has played perfectly fine so far! I really like the plot and the characters. But definately should be for eyes of 18 years old and up! Lol its all about sex, but beside that, its really an interesting all around awesome series! Oh but make sure the DVD plays in your region and that your DVD player isn't too out of date. My dvd player was so old, it wouldnt play. Had to go out and buy one. Luckily there are lots of sales going on, only paid 25 bucks.

1656370,4,B00005RIY5,"For many years Portland, Oregon (where I spent some formative years) and Pittsburgh, Pa alternated in occupying the top slot as America's Most Liveable City.  Folks who lived in Pittsburgh and tuned into this show must have been profoundly disappointed to realize that it's shot almost entirely in Toronto.  Apparently, while the producers felt that Pittsburgh was the American locale most like Manchester, England, in the original---Pittsburgh didn't have a large gay district---like SF or NYC---and Toronto did, and it was cheaper to film there.

Cheaper than Pittsburgh?  Really?

Ah well.  It's America's first tv show to focus on gay characters and even depict gay sex.  After watching who knows how many movies where I have to watch beautiful young women strip for toady but famous old actors, it's nice to see some studs take it off, and get it on with other studs.  And unlike too many gay movies up until fairly recently, they don't feel the urge to kill off a gay character to make the audience feel good.  It's also far better than a lot of gay movies out there, especially the saccharine ""Eating Out"" series where gay men act like teenage girls.

But is it a realistic portrayal of gay life?  It is every bit as realistic as ""Something's Gotta Give"", ""Mama Mia"" or ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" were to straight life, and, if you liked any of those you'll probably like this series too, unless the gay theme puts you off.  Truth is, in the real world (and even in San Francisco most of the week) a lot of gay people are just as ugly, boring, stupid, fat and old, as everyone else, and who would want to watch that?  Certainly there are stereotypes, drag queens only show up long enough to amuse us with their garish costumery, or to say something wickedly funny and then they sashay off.  None of the extreme-gay culture that dominates the Castro today was invited.  On the other hand, every now and then, as I found myself tut-tutting about some seemingly idiotic plot line, I'd hear a voice in my head giving me the old ""Ahem..."" reminding me that I lived through just that very scene in real life (including being the 29 year old stud with the amazingly pretty blonde 18 year old boyfriend, who's mother asked ""Why are you going out with him, he's so old!"".  That hurt!  But let me go back and relive that, now that I'm actually old).

Yes, it's a beautiful gay world where everyone is pleasant to look at, relatively successful, and lives a nice life surrounded by nice pretty people with great apartments and houses.  And they all go out together, work out together, and life has a very energetic disco beat.  I remember something like that, a little less here, a little more there...  and there is some drama towards the close of the first season---not quite the ""Downton Abbey"" sort of ""let's axe some main character"" drama, but things mix up.  All in all it's a very entertaining series, and while I can't believe I'm saying it, I think it's a bit better than the British original, and that has to mean something.",1408147200,,3026,4.627340823970037

It's interesting watching it again now, in our mid 30's, compared to then, when we were just barely 21 years old.  Going from being right around the same age as Justin to being older than Brian totally changes your perspective a bit.  It's been fun to rewatch, it's a great show that has aged well, imo, it's not one of those shows you remember loving only to rewatch it and wonder ""how did I ever like this, what was I thinking?!?"" like some shows.",1405468800,,586,4.3577981651376145

the entire package of the three seasons was a good value as far as i'm concerned, and i may possibly in the future purchase the United Kingdom versions of it as well.",1376006400,,833,4.012121212121212
1656397,5,B00005RIY5,"Queer As Folk is my favorite television show of all time. As a gay man, it's the only show that's ever been on the air that somewhat accurately reflects my life experience.  This was definitely my life when I was in my twenties up to about my mid-thirties, which is the age span of the characters.  I lived in the gay bars back than and I had friends like the flamboyant fashion victim Emmett, the sweetheart, Michael, the hot, edgy bad boy Brian, the true romantic, Justin and the nerdy Ted. I've known a few moms of gay friends who had a little of Debbie in them, though none were quite as extreme. Sure the characters are exaggerated, but that makes them all the more fun.
In the first season, the characters can be a bit stereotyped but they all grow and evolve through the five seasons of this show.  This is a show with true heart and it celebrates life, love and friendship.  Don't we all wish we had a group of friends as tight knit as these?  Or a mom as supportive and understanding as Debbie?
Many of the situations are very true to life, though some do venture off into fantasy land, especially some of Brian's sexual escapades.  Also, the producers are middle aged and I see their experiences in the storylines.  Some of the storylines were outdated for the time the show aired.  Most gay bars don't have back rooms any more and I don't see the crowds in gay bars being as unified and community-oriented as they seemed ""back in the day.""
That said, this is a very warm, heartfelt show that will leave you wanting more.  I've watched it time and time again, and love introducing ""newbies"" to it.",1375833600,,1607,4.420338983050847

I may not personally approve of everything shown in all it's gratuitous glory, like the sometimes cavalier use of ""party drugs"" , or the rampant promiscuity depicted in the backrooms and in bathhouses but that's what the FFwd button is for, if, like me, that's not your cup of tea.

It's not all sex,drugs, and club mixes however. The story lines about individuals and the various couple relationships are worth watching. The main pairing of Brian and Justin is a fascinating look at starcrossed lovers who make-up and break up on a continuous loop due to various insecurities and damaged psyches from past physical and emotional abuses.

Then, after searching for gay movies and such, i read reviews about it and I decided to order it, in VHS.  I had downloaded the first 3 episodes from the internet, and was just floored by them.  Once i got the box set, I just couldn't stop watching it.

This is the best gay series i have ever seen.  The acting, the sex scenes, music realistically depict the gay experience.  The main club in the series, Babylon, could be any large city USA, though this is supposed to be Pittsburgh.  Michael, one of the main characters, a voice of reason says ""It's all about sex"" in the opening scene.  We then see Michael's friends Emmet, a queen (though i think everybody has a little of that in them),Ted, David, who is a full-time slut, and Justin, a 17-year-old in high school who David picks up and then is obligated to kind of babysit as he comes out to the gay scene.  And back to Michael, he has a secret thing for David that he has to come to terms with.

This shows us (gays) for our good and bad points, and from the time i bought it, i finished all 20 episodes in 3 days.  I just couldn't believe it and it is so enthralling, deep, funny, painful.  I found this series on Amazon and purchased it fron them.

I was very touched by the stories, almost to the point of tears in every episode.

I have just started watching my Season two DVD's and am awaiting receipt of Season 3. I am still watching on Logo, which is now showing Season 3. I have to say about that season, I know I was supposed to be touched (which I was) by what I have read called the 'Needle Scene', where Michael threatens to infect himself with Ben's used syringe, but, in the same episode, but, I am most drawn to Ted and Emmitt's relationship where Ted has lost everything.",1258243200,2,992,4.1450777202072535

1656451,5,B00005RIY5,"I knew of the series, but wasn't particularly interested; I don't have HBO or Showtime. The depiction of gay people has seemed to go in one of two directions: outrageous or subtle. ""Queer as Folk"" is outrageous, and may have some stereotypical characters, but each one has a special distinction.  A colleague loaned me season One, and I watched it over a period of about 3 weeks. Not sure what to expect, I was almost immediately absorbed into the lives of these people. I enjoyed every episode completely. There's a lot of truth being conveyed, and it becomes a battle of which character you like the most. I liked Ted. Michael was endearing; Brian was reprehensible; Elliott was amusing (and wise); Justin is typically head-strong and adorable. The Lesbian sub-plot involves a wonderful scenario which is inter-weaved with all the other characters. I liked Ted the best; after years of disappointment, he is suspicious of affection, and has a deep alterior side that accepts life perhaps more objectively than the rest. The realist of the bunch, but as a human, he makes the most dumb choices.  Acting is uniformly excellent. The only ""big name"" in the cast is Sharon Gless, as Michael's pro-gay mother; also her brother is HIV positive and lives with her. I guess I don't need to say this stuff cuz if you're reading this, you already know. I was absorbed and intrigued by every episode; the sweetness as well as the seediness is explored. Hatred and homophobia are also well examined. Wonderful characters and writing make me look forward to watching Season 2. Let's give some time to the Queer community. The Hetero condition has already been explored ad nauseum.",1240704000,3,1668,4.869718309859155

1656453,5,B00005RIY5,"It took me awhile to discover ""Queer as Folk"". I had heard rumblings that Showtime was going to do a one hour weekly series on gay life in America, but I thought it would be poorly written and cheaply produced. So, after the first season nearly came to a close I sat down and watched the season finale after being prodded by friends to watch it. What I saw was jaw-dropping and the best piece of television work I have ever seen. It was also the most honest portrayal of homosexuality ever depicted on the screen. I was totally blown away, so much so I watched ""Queer as Folk"" the entire summer of 2001 while the show was in reruns and discovered my new best friends. The show explored many timely topics in that first season from coming out to a young gay boys first sexual experience.
 Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, who created and wrote ""Sisters' for NBC and wrote ""An Early Frost"", which dramatized AIDS way back in 1985, adapted ""Queer as Folk"" from Britain, where it ran for 2 season as a mini-series of sorts. I saw the British version and the American one outshines the former in all areas from the writing to the acting. Gale Harold, as Brian, the guy we all want to be, is unapologetic, and is a sexual predator, who discovers Justin on his first night on Liberty Avenue, the gay district of Pittsburg where the series takes place. It is through Justin, that we as viewers, are introduced to all the characters in the series. The rest of the cast and characters are superb from Peter Paige, who plays flamboyant Emmett to Hal Sparks, who plays Micheal, Brian's best friend. Sharon Gless is a knockout as Debbie, Michael's mom who supports her son and is the greatest defender of gays anywhere.
 The series is extremely well-written with the writers not being timid in their depiction of gay life. During the run of the first season we see scenes that show a lot of drug use and guys having sex with each other. This is an attempt to hook the audience, and before long you realize the show is depicting what gay life is. We also see Micheal getting involved with a doctor, Debbie dealing with her brother being HIV positive, and the wonderful portrayal of lesbians trying to raise a family and have a career. The just of the show is the relationship between Brian and Justin, and how Brian continues to pull away, and we also see Justin coming out to his parents, and ultimately we witness his father disowning him. The best episode is when Brian's father dies and we watch him finally erasing him out of his life once and for all, as we realize the reason Brian is the way he is.
 The first year features 22 amazing episodes, all produced in wide screen format with excellent audio. The season ends with a major beloved character being bashed, while one other major character leaves town. There were five seasons of ""Queer as Folk"" produced and I have been very lucky to own them all, but I must say this was the best. Sit back and make some new friends.",1237075200,2,2963,4.46309963099631

I absolutely fell in love with it with just one episode, I would tape and watch faithfully. I was determined to get the DVD version, so that I could see it uncut and in it's original form. The first season is very near and dear to my heart, probably the best of the series!! The show was casted perfectly, you will fall in love with each and every character.

The sex is presented as just another part of life (though a very integral one for these guys), something completely unusual in shows produced for the sex-phobic American market. It manages to be graphic and unsensational at the same time, and always relevant to the characters' personalities (Ethan's adventure with on-line dating is a hilarious twist on his everyday personality). It is a great mixture of drama and comedy, with a diverse set of characters that will grow on you. Michael's mother (Sharon Gless) is funny at first, but becomes a little bit over-the-top in later seasons. Other than that, a captivating and nearly perfect series that we were sad to see end.",1207958400,6,844,4.7482993197278915
1656467,5,B00005RIY5,"I could probably start this review by welcoming you into the world of gay sex, complete with disco music and darkrooms in clubs. I could invite you to watch sex scenes like you've never seen on TV, or I could go on and on praising ""Queer as Folk"" as a controversial TV show that makes the girls of ""Sex and the City"" look like school girls. ""Queer as Folk"" is all this, but much, much more. By the end of season one, and once the initial shock wears off, you will find yourself actually watching this show not because of the sex it's not afraid to show, but because of the plights and emotional conflicts of its characters.
The three main characters are probably meant to represent a cross-section of gay culture - Hal Sparks plays the ""sensitive narrator"" role, Gale Harold is Brian, the predator, and Randy Harrison plays Justin, the virgin. Also, there are Emmett and Ted, and also Melanie and Lindsay, the lesbian couple... The list goes on and on, but the good thing is that the stereotypical concept fades out during the show - ""Queer as Folk"" treats its characters like actual, emotional humans, who evolve as the show progresses. It can make a powerful emotional punch as well as a sex scene, and that is what makes this show so good. The fact that it makes you care for the characters because of who they are, and not simply because they're gay is the biggest praise I can give this excellent show.

1656468,5,B00005RIY5,"And after watching this show, to add to what my co-worker told me, I would've taken the WHOLE day off in anticipation to what was in store for me for what was going to happen next on this show!!!

'Cause that's how you start to feel once you get into this show.  I mean, I was totally hooked after watching the first episode--if not, after watching the first minute!!!

I found myself liking all of the characters instantly and I liked how most of the characters are all connected to each other in one way or the other, like how Emmett and Michael are roommates.  Ted is secretly in love with Michael.  And how even though Michael and Brian are best friends, Michael, in his own way has a thing for Brian and Brian, in my opinion, has a thing for Michael--even though Brian's never going to admit that.

I also liked the overall tone of the show. And how it could somehow balance itself with having a scene go in one direction towards the outrageous (insert Brian here) and then how it could go in a very down to earth, very human and touching direction (also, insert Brian here.)

I guess I just have a thing for the Brian character and though how on the surface, he might be plotting and making everything be all about him--you just have to wait for the moments when it's just him and Michael and you get a glimpse that there's a whole lot more cooking with him.

To get an example of this, please see the episode wherein the fellas are heading out to New York to find Justin, who's run away.  There's a moment, when the car gets a flat and Emmett and Ted have to fix it and Brian and Michael sneak away to share a joint.

As the scene unfolds, Brian tells Michael how much he means to him.  And then before you know it, the two of them are kissing.

But that's not the part, that gets to you. It's how when Ted & Emmett start telling them that the car is ready, it's like Brian holds onto Michael maybe a little longer than he has to and while doing this, Brian at this point kisses Michael on the forehead.  That one little scene tells you just how human Brian really is.  (Incidentally, those were always my favorite scenes throughout the show--the little moments that were quiet and unassuming--you might have to really look for them, but man are they worth it!)  :)

Anyway, I can't say enough about this show.  I hope everyone out there who hasn't watched this show, will give it a try.  I think you'll be very surprised in more ways than one.

I know I was!

(Also, a BIG shout out to the phenomenal Hal Sparks!!!)  What he gave to the character Michael was truly amazing!!!  I can't imagine the WHOLE world not falling in love with him.  (I know I did!!!)",1206403200,4,2665,4.296593186372745
1656469,5,B00005RIY5,"I was first exposed to this show on the tv channel LOGOS this summer but I knew they were cutting out language and scenes.  The DVD has everything so if you are uncomfortable with same sex action, male-male or female-female stay away.  That said this is not pornography in that the sex while highly suggestive does not show penetration and rarely full frontal. The show is also not for anyone who has tender ears because the characters swear up a storm.  If you like to see characters struggle with their everyday lives, society, and a solid dose of hot male bodies then I highly recommend season 1 on DVD.  I most also commend the writers and producers for doing a lot of foreshadowing for later seasons which bespeaks of quality work and committee to the project from everyone.",1192752000,3,779,4.6231884057971016

None are as daring or as truthfully blunt about things. Don't sugarcoat it, that's stupid. Don't hide something because it might make someone uncomfortable, that's also stupid. If you're uncomfortable, that's your own problem. The characters are well developed and they are each special in their own way. The first season introduces us to them and gets us comfortable for what's to come in later seasons.

1656471,5,B00005RIY5,"This show is absolutely, 100% amazing. It showed me a side of the gay community I'd never seen, and it's an interesting and intriguing show. I really am glad that I bought this because I was afraid that I'd watch the whole season and then not ever watch it again. This did not happen. I've watched every episode at least three times, and certain episodes I've watched at least seven times. The show is just great.

The package, however, was not in the greatest of condition. When I recieved it in the mail, it was all beat up, and the box was coming apart. Not to mention I didn't recieve the product shown. Instead of recieving the fold out DVD case, I got a box with DVD boxes inside of it. When I recieved it, I didn't exactly care about the condition of the box since I was so excited about watching the show. I kind of forgot about the condition of the box, since the DVDs ran pretty well. By the time I got to the last disc, which was a few weeks later, since I was watching all the episodes in succession and I didn't have time to watch them all quickly. I was watching the 21st episode and I got about halfway through it, and it skipped like half a scene. I took out the disc, thinking I perhaps got fingerprints all over it, so I could wipe it off. When I looked at the disc, however, there was a large, circular scratch around the outside of the disc. I tried cleaning it off, but it didn't come off. Fortunately, after cleaning it out, it only digitized a little at the part, and the sound was unaffected. Also, none of the other episodes were affected, so I really don't think it's that big of a deal.

However, next time I order something from Amazon, if it's damaged, I'm sending it right back. I'm not going to take any risks.

1656484,5,B00005RIY5,"I first saw most of series I, when it first debuted on Showtime. I found it disturbing that an older man, was having sex with a 17 year old. In today's world, that man, Brian Kinney, would be labeled as a sexual predator, and required to register as a sex offender. It certainly could give fire to those who say that QAF gives ""proof"" that gay men, prey on children.  I am also disturbed by the large focus on Brian Kinney, who appears to be very narcisstic; something that as a mental health counselor, I see a lot of, in gay men.  It is all about them. The series revolves around a lot of sexual encounters, with the only real relationship, between two lesbians.  I see the possibility of a lot of stereotypes being reinforced, about gay men and lesbian women. However, I feel it is a must see, as it is meant to stir up a lot of feelings, and those feelings need to be pulled out and examined.

I am not, nor have I have ever claimed to be gay - I'm not even bi-sexual, I am a female who loves the male physique....  and I love this show!!!! The characters are full and complex - I have noticed that most television shows begin to become stale because after a seson or two, the characters are predictible - in an oh so boring way - this show is the exception.  Every character retains his/her basic characteristics, but all end up being more than you initially give them credit for. Through the few seasons this show existed, every character in this series is more true to life - they end up being surprising - much like people everyone knows - it's sometimes surprising in a great way and other times you are as disappointed in these characters as you are in people in you own life and at the same time, you can't help but care about all of them. Throughout this series, I wanted so much for every character to come full circle - to see themselves as the rest of the world sees them - strenths, faults and all.... The final season gives the viewer that usually unobtainable gratification...... that one thing most of us always desire for those we care about the most, but are not able to se them experience in real life - you are able to watch all of the characters come full circle - they see where there personal hang-ups have failed the people they love the most and make amends in a way that is heartfelt rather than the over the top portrayal you usually experience in a run of the mill 2 hour move.  I've watched every season at least three times and it's always entertaining and touching and even sad at some points.  The creators of this series have received a HUGE 5 stars from this viewer!!  The sex scenes are gratuitous and I have to admit that at the end of all of these seasons, there are far fewer things that will shock me.  I was raised in a VERY conservative Christian household.  My father and I no longer see eye to eye and that is fine with me.  As a result of this show - I am a better person.  As a young adult, I was the judgemental and self-righteous individual my parents raised me to be; however, as a result of the diverse group of individuals I work with as well as the contribution of this series, I now see that everyone on this earth is just a person,  that wants much the same things I do, or much the same things my friends want - regardless of color, gender or sexual orientation.  This show was a big eye opener for me and I don't feel offended as a result of exposure - which is what I think my father would prefer - I feel like a more educated and enlightened person as a result of this show. For me, this show has given equality to everyone I encounter - we are all so similar and I now see this...  I cannot thank the creators or the people who decided to finance this project enough.

What I ended up with was a closet of messy children's clothing because I was compelled to watch undistracted. I immediately purchased the rest of the seasons and was a gruesome addict to the end.

1656524,5,B00005RIY5,"Okay, well I've just finished watching the entire first series boxset of ""Queer As Folk"" with my boyfriend and felt compelled to write about it - it's brilliant and we were totally glued to it - the sign of a great programme surely! Being a UK resident I do of course remember the original version of the show, broadcast a number of years back, but to be honest I wasn't all that enamoured with it at the time. Despite all the ""hot"", graphic sex scenes and groundbreaking depiction of gay culture, it also seemed quite cold and uncritical in its portrayal of the whole gay lifestyle and I found it quite hard to warm to many of the characters. However the US show in my opinion achieves so much more than the UK version and pushes things a good deal further.

One of the main reasons for this is that the first series is an amazing 22 episodes in length (as opposed to the 8 episodes of the UK series) which allows us as viewers plenty of time to get to know all of the characters and to see how their lives, loves and relationships develop. The first series deals with a wide variety of issues and situations such as coming out at home, school and in the workplace, teenage-older man relationships, lesbian mothers, drug addiction, gays and lesbians seeking to ""convert"" their orientation, to name a few.

I'd liken ""Queer as Folk"" to a gay version of Sex and the City - the four lead characters are all gay and are close friends, with strong bonds and intertwining lives. We see the lives and loves of each character portrayed in depth, with a shifting focus on each character per episode.

Some of the characters are clearly modelled on their counterparts from the English version. Brian is the US equivalent of Stuart - a hedonism-seeking lothario, the ultimate archetype of the promiscuous gay man, someone who enjoys the thrill of the chase and who is out to get what he wants, whether the object of his desire be straight, gay or married. He's a commitment-phobe who is cut off from any deeper emotion. And yet as the series unfolds we get to see chinks in his emotionless armour, exposed through his tenuous relationship with the loved-up Justin and his dying father.

Then there's Michael. As in the UK version, he's the ""Mr nice guy"" character and also incredibly gorgeous and cute! It must be those dark puppy dog eyes and the winning smile, something that reminds me of my own boyfriend (he'll be so glad I wrote that). He's a supermarket employee who's in the closet at work, something which causes problems when he starts receiving attention from one of the female employees there and also gets offered a promotion to position of manager. Away from the world of work, he's a big fan of ""Captain Astro"" a comic book superhero. In the UK version this character was a Dr Who fan, something I can totally relate to, however I guess they changed this for the US as not enough people have heard of it over there!

We also have Emmett, the archetypal ""camp"" and flamboyant gay man, signposted most obviously by his dress sense (tight fitting tops, t-shirts and slacks in abundance), mannerisms and arch comments/remarks. And yet although he comes closest to the role of ""queen"" amongst this group of characters, he is not cast in the tragic, negative, bitchy mould of other such gay men, which I think is a very positive piece of characterisation. As the actor who plays him said, Emmett is, ironically, the most ""together"" of the characters, dispensing sensible advice and wisdom to his friends when needed.

Ted is the ""Mr Average"" gay guy, working as an accountant and alleviating the boredom of his job by surfing the net for porn while at his desk (something none of us have ever done, I'm sure...) He's also got a secret crush on Michael. There are some interesting plotlines involving him, including one where he falls for a cute twink boy with a crystal meth addiction and the subsequent tensions this causes in their relationship.

These are the four gay friends I mentioned, but there are also a number of other important characters.

Justin is the cute teenager and the ""twink"", with artistic leanings, in his final year at high school and in the process of coming out at the start of this show. We see him venturing onto the gay scene for the very first time, then meeting and quickly falling for Brian. This is a situation I think we can all relate to, as we all know what it's like to experience love for another man for the first time and the whirlpool of feelings this can create! As the series unfolds Justin goes through an amazing growth process, becoming more confident within himself, coming out to his mum and dad and forming a gay-straight alliance at his high school, much to the chagrin of his teachers. Ironically as the show's most junior character he quickly shapes up to be one of the most mature and certainly keen to assert his rights as a gay man.

Melanie and Lindsay are the show's lesbian couple. Lindsay has just given birth to a baby boy in episode one and Brian is the voluntary father! This leads to some problems later on. Their characters are somewhat too peripheral to start with and they seem to get continually saddled with ""parent and baby"" plotlines. However as the series moves on they start to develop as characters in their own right, with strong performances from both actresses.

Debbie is Michael's Mum played by Sharon Gless of Cagney and Lacey fame. She works as a waitress in a gay cafe on the scene, not something we can often claim of our real mothers! She is a fun and rather larger than life, obviously put in the show as the comic foil, but her ""right-on"" stance and the fact that she is fiercely supportive of gay rights make her an inspirational character. Like Emmett she is often on hand to dish out advice and support to the others, not least Michael.

Vic is Michael's gay uncle and Debbie's brother, and as one of the senior characters is on hand to supply the worldly wisdom. There's a good plotline with Vic later in the series when he is (wrongly) entrapped by a plain clothes cop in a public toilet, and the case goes to court.

It's a testimony to the strength of the acting that all of the above characters come across so convincingly. Unlike the UK version I think that you actually get to care more about these characters and their predicaments as the series moves on, becoming more involved with their lives and wanting to know what will happen to them further on. These are warm, real, fully rounded people. The actors give the characters their ""all"" and you really do root for them (even the selfish Brian!)

Another reason for the show's success is its skilful blend of drama and comedy, something that ""Sex and the City"" also achieved so well. There are some excellent and well-conveyed ""serious"" plotlines alongside some more lightweight ones and the show deals with all aspects of gay culture - there really is something in here for everyone. Admittedly not every situation in the programme is believable - for example, the plot line with the French guy who Lindsey decides to marry when she splits with Melanie, which quickly gets forgotten about once they get back together! Also some storylines seem to get dropped quite quickly - the ongoing story with Michael's female co-worker who fancies him has a very quick resolution once she finds out his true orientation and we never see her again!

Of course I forgot to mention the very hot sex scenes throughout the show. These are a definite bonus (!) and are helped along by the fact that all of the guys and gals involved are highly attractive! However I don't think these scenes are gratuitous. I'm in agreement with one of the other reviewers who says that they're there as part of the story and characters. As sex is such an integral part of the modern gay scene I think it would be pretty hard to present a gay drama without it.

Another brilliant aspect of the series is its music soundtrack. In just about every episode we are treated to pumping house music courtesy of the resident club, Babylon, something many men out on the scene will be familiar with. But music is also used very effectively to augment many of the programme's emotional and sexual scenes, adding to the tension, mood and drama during key moments. One of my personal favourites is the track ""Straight to Number One"" by Touch & Go, often used to compliment the show's hotter moments, and a very sensual, sassy number!

I have one very small gripe with this box set, which is the lack of subtitles. My boyfriend is Brazilian and English not being his first language, he definitely would have benefited from this! On the whole though I would say this Region 1 box set is a definite improvement over the UK Region 2 version, as it contains a wealth of extras, including character and actor profiles, deleted and blooper scenes and commentaries. The soundtrack and picture are generally excellent too. By contrast the recent UK Region 2 version contains an inferior picture and soundtrack and none of the above extras. So if you have a multi-region DVD I'd strongly recommend that you purchase the Region 1 version. It might take longer to reach you but its well worth the wait.

To summarise I cannot recommend this series enough - it's powerful, dramatic, funny, moving, sad, uplifting and overall a fantastic piece of television. An absolute must have.

The Guys

Michael Novotny - The boy next door that always seems to be the best friend.  Michael is the assistant manager at the Q-mart where he hides his orientation.  Chief fetish: Comic Books.

Emmett Honeycutt - The queen, not a drag queen but the flaming queen who wears his homosexuality as a badge of honor and definitely flaunts it.  He is ""temporarily"" living at Michael's.  He is a window dresser at Torso.

Ted Schmidt - The sweet brains of the group and is the oldest at 33!  He has a big heart but that's not the organ the guys are interested in.  He works for an accounting firm and is in the closet at work.

Brian Kinney - He is the hunk every man wants to be with.  He is a hot shot advertising exec and has all the trappings that that allows.  While he doesn't flaunt his sexuality, he oozes it.  Quite often he closes a new client by servicing the client.

The Girls

First, I want to state that I love this Season.  But there are some things that I must say.

1. Watching this for the first time you are amazed by the in your face style.  On second look you notice a lot of stereotypes that are not flattering.

2. Once again all the cast are great looking.  Let's see some average guys and girls.  The only time you see an average looking or worse person is when they need to make a joke.

3. This is a gay fantasy land.  Places like this do not exist in the real USA and especially for a city like Pittsburgh.

4. If this show was on HBO instead of Showtime it would have reapped many Emmy nominations - especially Sharon Gless.

What I am saying is this is not the holy grail of gay entertainment but the first season was excellent.

DVD EXTRAS:

Disc One - Special Edition Episode 1: This is not just a commentary track but when the commentary is being made the person appears on the side.  This is unusual but very interesting. (Michelle Clunie's commentaries are funny because she is still in character.)

Disc Three - Special Edition Episode 11: Same as above with Sharon Gless as part of the mix.

Disc Five - Special Edition Episode 18: Same as above.

Disc Six -

Extended Scenes Introduced by Hal Sparks: 17 minutes of deleted scenes and extended scenes.  As I always say, having introductions or commentary on these scenes is always desirable.

Behind the Scenes Outtakes: Six Minutes of Outtakes

Meet the Folk:

Characters - sort of like if they were filling out a profile on a dating web site for the top eight characters with each actor giving a 30 second to one minute interview about the character.

Actors - Standard actor bios

Production Team - Standard creator bios with video clips of the producers.

Season 2 Sneak Preview - A five minute preview of the second season.  The DVD came out just before the second season premiere and this was to promote the new season.

1656530,5,B00005RIY5,"Since the price of the dvd set of Queer As Folk's first season has been lowered, I felt I should write a review.

Straight and gay people alike have watched this show. This was the first of its kind, and although the show tended to get better in later seasons, it's still nonetheless great to watch! Sharon Gless is a joy to watch, and is one of the main reasons I stuck with this show from beginning to end! The entire cast are great actors, and just because most of the characters happen to be gay, it does not mean a person viewing this remarkable show has to be gay!

The beginning of the series starts with a high school student who comes to terms with his sexuality (very easily) and ends up meeting a group of friends-all of which have their own quirks, problems, and comedic moments. This show really is something to witness. Showtime did an excellent thing by putting this on the air",1135036800,5,892,4.367469879518072

I recommend this product to Gay or Straight people because of the true life style of young gay men. Camera angles are good through out and the soundtracks are good through the whole season.

The extra Bonus sessions are brillent. They give you more insight to how the actors create the characters, behind the scene footage and outtakes are good !

I've often thought that if the mature scenes were cut out of the show, it would be a great thing to show in schools. It would help promote understanding, and tolerence of gays in general.  Of course it would never pass all the political red tape in order to be shown. But, I'm just pondering the affect this show could have.

You just fall in love with these characters. They all seem so REAL. This show is brilliantly written.

1656551,5,B00005RIY5,"At first glance, Queer as Folk is a flashy, over-titilating exaggeration of graphic sex, drugs and techno music Homo-style. You may have trouble buying the alpha ""Gay"" male, Brian Kinney on his quest to sleep with everything beautiful that moves and breathes. You may sigh with frustration at the 17-year-old Justin Taylor's obsession for a man that will only break his young heart. And you will most certainly yawn at the doting, whining Michael who follows behind Brian, his childhood friend, in hopes of one day getting lucky with him.

But as this first season progresses, we will see that Brian actually does have a heart, that Justin is mature beyond his year and knows what he wants, and that Michael can let go of childish fantasies to begin to see what is real and important in his life.

Complimented with a richly colorful, supporting cast, Queer as Folk attempts to give mainstream audiences a tiny taste of life for seven Pittsburgh, twenty-something characters, who just happen to be gay. Queer as Folk is superbly cast with performances that are touching, hillarious and honest. In the words of Peter Paige: You may come for the queer, but you'll stay for the folk.",1128816000,,1180,4.836633663366337

This is a series that I think we will look back on as a turing point in television.  There has never been anything else quite like it.  Finally the manufacturer got smart and realized that a lot more people would probably by this at $40 than would ever buy it at $100!  The flyer inside this ""new low price"" edition claims that Season 2 will be released at a new low price on October 18.

Maybe it would have put alot of things in focus. I just love Hal Sparks ( Michael) His character remembers me alot of myself. Always putting himself out there and not every being taken for his worth. This first season puts alot of the issues with being gay out there in the open. Like gay bashing, parents dealing with coming out, and the ups and downs of just having a ""gay"" realtionship.  It's a ""must"" have. The soundtrack is fab as well!",1127174400,,617,4.228813559322034
1656578,4,B00005RIY5,"Queer as Folk is one of those shows that evokes extremes of opinions in viewers:  they either love the show and get enthralled by the ""soap opera"" goings-on of the characters; or, they hate the show and are totally turned off by the pervasive sex and drug use of many of the characters.  Nevertheless, QAF captured a devoted audience during its five-year run on Showtime.

Like many American dramas and sitcoms, QAF was based on a British series of the same name.  Set in Pittsburgh, PA (a bizarre choice, in my opinion) the show followed the lives and ""adventures"" of the uber-slut yuppie Brian (Gale Harold), the teenaged cutie Justin (Randy Harrison), the perpetually dull homebody Ted (Scott Lowell), the flamboyantly fabulous Emmett (Peter Paige), the all-around good guy Michael (Hal Sparks), and the granola lesbians, ""lipstick"" Lindsey (Thea Gill) and ""butch"" Melanie (Michelle Clunie).  A host of supporting characters, led by Michael's outrageous mother Debbie (Sharon Gless), helped move the show and its characters along.  Despite the pedestrian use of gay archetypes, the quality of the writing and the good acting kept me watching the show and speculating about the next move each character would make.

Season One centered around Brian's recent fatherhood and his relationship with Justin (who, incidentally, was in the very early stages of the coming-out process).  Having followed the show through four additional seasons and watched as the characters grew and changed, it is interesting to return to the beginning and see the origins of the QAF phenomenon.

Besides the expected objections from the Republican/religious right, season one drew additional heated criticism for its frank portrayal of a sexual relationship between 29 year-old Brian and 17 year-old Justin (such a relationship would be illegal in many American states).  Further, many of the characters are shown using ecstasy and/or crystal meth at the local dance club Babylon (not to mention the casual sex in the club's notorious back room).

Despite its faults, I believe the show marked a milestone in gay American history, and will be remembered for introducing the ""urban gay world"" to mainstream America.  If you don't mind the explicit sex, drug use, and language, the show will entertain and enthrall you for hours at a time.",1126828800,2,2317,5.18230563002681

Some of the situations are dramatized up but they do have to get the point across now don't they.

The main characters look fantastic and the storylines while sometimes a copy of the UK version have a unique slant.  Different writers are involved  in each episode with so many issues addressed in this series. This is a TV series which will always be remembered for its groundbreaking pilot episodes and those of us who are addicts (myself included) will never get sick of watching the complete series (S1 to S4) over and over again.  So many memorable quotes too numerous to mention.  ""There is no such thing as enough"" quote by the inimitable Brian Kinney.  This will always be my all-time favourite show in spite of the language.  The actors although most of them unknown before now do a fantastic job even though they had never met each other before the show started.

It is hot and daring and in your face. It was not afraid to push the envelope and that was great. Brian Kinney is the main man. He is honest about his life and doesnt make apoligies. Michael is different than i expected. In some ways i think that justin is about as mature as Michael if not more. It was the whole comic book thing. Justin is a mystery to me. I never got what it was about him that made Brian 'keep' him around. If you know then please tell me. Ted reminded me of Kevin Spacey when i first saw him. Am i the only one? I LOVE Emmett. He is so hilarious. You cant help but love him. QAF delt with serious issues and also managed to make you laugh. My favorite scene in the first season was at Justin's prom. When he and Brian danced.

I'm straight, yet I can relate to all of the characters, and as much as they piss me off sometimes, I love all of them, too.

1656610,5,B00005RIY5,"Nominated for 9 Craft Awards (bestowed by the Director's Guild of Canada), Queer As Folk is a groundbreaking drama series that has built itself a large cult following since its inception in 2000. Based on a British TV series of the same name, Queer As Folk is in many ways similar to HBO's Sex And The City, and it's one of the first TV dramas to be completely centered around the lives of homosexual characters, or even have prominent homosexual characters - following on the heels of groundbreaking sitcoms such as Ellen (1994) and Will & Grace (1998). The brainchild of UK-born writer and creator Russell T. Davies, Queer As Folk follows the life and times of a group of gay friends as they live out their respective lives in modern-day America...

Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Queer As Folk follows the exploits of a group of gay and lesbian friends who live on or around Liberty Avenue. Most of the scenes take place either in the character's homes, a local diner, or the popular gay nightclub Babylon. Lindsay Peterson (Thea Gill) and Melanie Marcus (Michelle Clunie) comprise the lone lesbian couple to star in the series, while various gay friends and neighbors such as Brian Kinney (Gale Harold), Michael Novotny-Bruckner (Hal Sparks), Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison), Ted Schmidt (Scott Lowell), Emmett Honeycutt (Peter Paige), etc. deal with each other and their own varying relationships. Composed in a drama/soap opera format, Queer As Folk centers wholly on the careers and lives (including sex, drugs, love, friendships, tragedies, etc.) of its diverse characters, maintaining a specific focus on its attempted realistic portrayal and illustration of the American homosexual lifestyle...

The Queer As Folk (Season 1) DVD features a number of interesting episodes including the series premiere in which, following a night of entertainment at Babylon with his friends, Brian goes home with a man named Justin, but has a difficult time conveying to Justin that he doesn't want to pursue a relationship. Meanwhile, friends Lindsay and Melanie are celebrating the birth of their new baby boy, Gus... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Episode 110"" in which Brian evicts Justin after he forgets to set the alarm and the place gets robbed, and ""Episode 118"" in which Justin learns that his parents are getting a divorce while Ted is reunited with Blake...

The actors are amazing, from the self-centered Brian to the flamingly-over-the-top Emmett, to the one we can all relate to, Michael.  There are a lot of both shockingly hot and touchingly heartfelt moments in this series.

Of all the seasons I've seen so far, this one has the best bonus material.  It's a must for any QAF fan.  I enjoyed seeing the actors and directors talk about the characters.  There is also commentary for some specific episodes that explains how the scenes were set up and so on.

Not only is it outstanding, but it's really a groundbreaking event in which America is FINALLY being more open to the fact that the gay world and gay lifestyles doesn't have to be seen as a big deal. The show depicts real people with real lives. And the characters are actually very intriguing, i actually feel for the them, like Justin! Not only that but the sex scenes are extremely hot and very erotic, this is far more raw, real, and edgy than Sex and the City. It's very refreshing to have QAF, and the L Word (which i don't find to be as fun, interesting, realistic, or sexy as QAF, but it's growing) be on American television.

1656635,3,B00005RIY5,"I am not sure how accurate Queer As Folk is in portraying gay life in America, but I am sure that all the emotional issues and drama the characters endure are what all people, gay or straight, go through.

We have the cast of four characters: a male Samantha, Charlotte, Miranda, and Carrie.  Michael (Carrie), Brian (Samantha), Emmett (Miranda), and Ted (Charlotte) live, work, and party in Pittsburgh.  Their main hangout is the decadent nightclub Babylon (althought Sodom and Gomorrah comes to mind).  Other characters include a lesbian couple, Lindsay and Melanie, who are raising a baby boy.  The baby's biological father is Brian.  Like his alter ego Samantha, Brian is a live-for-the-moment, screw for fun, risk-taking, great-looking bad boy.  One of the sweetest things in the series - one of the main reasons I am sticking with the series even though I am uncomfortable with the graphic sex - is that Brian is so tender with his child and loves him so much.  Just as sweet, and more intriguing, is the deep feeling and connection he has with the baby's mom.  Never mind lesbian or gay, these two people love each other.  Even Melanie is jealous of Brian.  Melanie hates his guts.  Brian and Lindsay are total yin and yang.  They can deny each other nothing, not matter how they try.  I am dying to see how this true love triangle turns out.

Another reason I am sticking with the series is the character of Justin.  A seventeen-year old who is in love with and in a hot, sexual relationship with Brian, Justin is bold.  He knows who he is and is going out into the world and getting it.  I also adore Justin's little friend, Daphne.  Justin's mom, Jennifer, is struggling with the fact that her son is homosexual.  She is also bold, overcoming her fear to enter his world, chasing him as Justin is chasing Brian.

Emmett is really sweet.  Ted is a washed-up loser, sorry!  He meets someone perfect for him, but lets the guy go for no good reason.  Ted takes drugs from a stranger and goes into a coma.  The stranger abandons him.  Later he sees the stranger at the nightclub and wants to get together with him.  Loser!

All the main, supporting, and guest actors and actresses in here are brave, charting a new world for American society and American television.  I do fast forward the sex scenes.  They are simply gay porn, which I am not into.  But the stories are so compelling, and there are lots of laugh-out-loud moments as well as thought-provoking dialouge.",1110240000,4,2474,4.644341801385681

1656637,5,B00005RIY5,"This show is amazingly outstanding. It's definitely ""in-your-face"" and not for the weak-of-heart or close-minded individuals. It's a series based on the queer community mixed with humor, emotion, and enough eye candy that would make even Wonka's Umpa Loompa's hard. The actors on this show are completely amazing. Each one of them are superbly casted for the roles they take on. Two of my favorite actors on the show are actually both females. Michelle Clunie, who plays a lesbian lawyer (in a 8-year relationship with her partner, Lindsay) outstandlingly. And the second, Sharon Gless, the heterosexual mother who can be seen as wanting to be a gay man herself. The show makes no apologies (most notably in Brian Kinney played by Gale Harold) to anyone for the contents of the show and its portrayal of gay life.

This season lays all the ground work for the seasons to follow. It doesn't truly explain where the characters came from but it does enough that you can guess, and you'd guess correctly.

They hook up for the night and Brian thinks nothing else of it, Justin on the otherhand has fallen head over heels in love with Brian, as it was his first time. These two were extremely interesting to watch throughout the season, as we saw them develop and grow. Brian is my absolute favourite character and even though he can be an assehole you cant help but love him. The other are interesting too and i love them all.

And people who flip around and somehow got this show, and automatically hate it because of a couple scenes they didn't wanna see. To those people, you are always gonna get a show that you don't like when you flip. Like when I flip and the republican convention is on every channel, I don't complain about it on the internet. Because there are some republican [guys] out there who would get offended. And another thing, people also say that this show has a bunch of characters that look like they never eat. Well let me ask you something, do you wanna see fat people having sex? And you don't have to let out your insecurities, by bashing this show. I'm very skinny, and I have a high matabolism, saying that the look annorexic is saying that nobody is ever thin.

I personally love this show. And everybody who hates it for dumbass reasons are obviously stuck in their mom's basement.

Although I'm willing to put up with this on a video rental, I think that the retail price is too high for such sloppy craftsmanship.

But the incredible turn-on is the show itself, which has been finely written, directed and acted since its inception (now spanning four seasons).  It's not a stretch to say QAF ranks with cable's best, including The Sopranos and Six Feet Under.  The glory of this show is that it refuses to take itself too seriously (Alan Ball take note) yet also manages to be genuinely heartfelt without veering into schlockiness.  What you have is thoroughly adult fare that is entertaining, intelligent and sometimes spellbinding.  The direction crackles and pops, the camera work's great, the editing sure-fire; the main characters continue to grow through challenges such as testicular cancer, drug addiction, living with a partner who has AIDS and being assaulted by gay bashers.  Yet, despite the obvious opportunity for melodrama, QAF plays it straight, and --when merited -- tongue-in-cheek.  It's all great fun.

The American version is allot hotter than the uk version, but in terms of scripts its a million times better. I have seasons 1 & 2 and have just ordered 3. And when 4 is released that will be ordered too.

They're just in a different frame of mind or a different space. I say that because, QAF, is a good show. Yeah, it's a soap opera with characters that are somewhat exaggerated and some outrageos situations, but it's TV, and it's what makes watching it fun.  Now, this show isn't for everyone because I think some of the people who saw this show was looking for something that represented the gay lifestyle in a more realistic way.  And yes, a lot of times it doesn't because it's a TV show. There's plenty of TV shows out there with outrageous situations and characters, but on SOME level, we can identify and relate to them and also, it's just good to look at sometimes.
I think those guys and several others, just watch the first 3 episodes, and wrote it off as bad, but, with some shows it's designed to just start off with a bang and make it all flashy and then break the characters down and make them more human.
But yes, this show can be superficial, but that IS the reality of it.  It's not ALWAYS that way, but it can be, and the show just takes us all to that one point in life when it's fresh and everything is all about the looks and daring situations before you get to more emotionally complex situations, as this show does cleverly and quickly.

1656667,1,B00005RIY5,"Amazonians,
First, I must introduce myself as a gay guy.  There are so many of us!  I offer kudos to Boy Corrupted, who hit the nail right on the head when he said that this show is superficial.
The focus on sex, sex, and more sex, with no real look into the personalities and lives of the characters in this show really do a disservice to the gay community.  Our community is beautiful, full of the same love, respect, and talent that exists in the straght world, but it is not given enough light in this show.  American movies and television shows miss the point when it comes to showing real life and relationships.  It is so unnatural and rehearsed.  Just try watching a foreign series, and you will know what I am talking about.  I haven't seen the British version of Queer As Folk, but would be tremendously interested in doing so.  I am sure it is phenomenally done.
It is true that gay culture reveres good looks, and the club life, but there is much more to it than parties and getting wasted.  Gay life is about love, and the desire to be loved an accepted ust like everyone else.  If QAF would touch on some political issues, like the importance of gay marriage, that would serve our community well.  If the show would educate its viewership instead of serving up old stereotype, that would also help.  I am longing for a series that would be sweet and candid, showing the gay community for what it is.  Shows like QAF, and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy for that matter, only paint the gay community in a negative light.  I hope this review catches the eye of a daring producer who will create the kind of masterpiece we need to show us for who we really are.
I will follow up on this review when I have more time, I am at work at the moment!
Love to All,
--Daniel",1084838400,12,1776,4.3102409638554215
1656668,1,B00005RIY5,"This is going to be one of those ""unhelpful"" reviews, so you might as well go ahead and click the button right now.  I assume if you're browsing this item, you're probably already a fan, and I am about to rain all over your parade.  Because I DESPISE ""Queer As Folk"" with every fiber of my being - so much so that I have to write a review of it purely to vent my anger and disgust.
By the way, I'm gay.  Or at least, I'm a guy who's in a relationship with a guy, but if this show represents what ""gay"" actually is 90% of the time (and, sigh, I might have to concede that it does), then it's time for me to disinherit my family.  Shallow, superficial, sex-obsessed, puerile, whiny, nasty, backstabbing, emotionally stunted men running around living Barbie stereotypes of gay lifestyles.  I hate every single character on this show.  I swear to god, I can't even decide what's more sickening - hearing Brian brag about his 30 different tricks a month (which, ""safe"" or not, is extravagantly neurotic behavior), or watching Emmett go christian and deny his homosexuality altogether.  None of these people are remotely capable of having a healthy sex drive or life, or of otherwise doing anything that's not utterly frivolous and idiotic.  And this is the image that so many gay fans are evidently thrilled to see portrayed on TV.  Brian's ridiculous and suicidal promiscuity finally gets him into professional trouble when one of his ""tricks,"" who also happens to be under his employ, slaps him with a sexual harrasment suit.  Meanwhile Emmett comes frighteningly close to breeding with a similarly self-deluded lesbian, until his friends conspire to win him back by renting out a gay porn star for a romantic evening with the foppish fencesitter.  Wouldn't ya know, he comes right around (so to speak).  Then we have obnoxious stock twink no. 532, Justin, who is ""just beginning to realize his sexual power"" - which means that it's dawning on him that his ""barely legal"" status is a potent aphrodisiac for sleazy business guys in their 30's.  He prances around and sucks blo-pops and we're all supposed to be charmed - whatever, I'm not elderly enough to find him appealing.  And finally, Hal Spark's character, what's-his-name.  All I have to say about Hal Sparks is that I always thought he was gay when he was on Talk Soup, and I found it annoying when he would talk about women (as if), and now he's still supposed to be straight apparently, but he is thoroughly convincing (though annoying as ever) as a gay ""average joe"" on QAF.  Anyway he's probably doing well with the ladies now, cuz we all know that females love gay guys.
Now I understand that what I have basically done is complain about the way gay men are represented on this show, but (again) I can't really say that it's inaccurate as far as it goes - it just doesn't go very far.  What we have here is 100% pure superficial gay drama.  QAF is definitely ""portraying a lifestyle,"" to use the Eminem defense, and I'll defend to death the rights of the producers et al to do so; but it's equally my right to express my rage at this portrayal because I feel that it's emphasizing all the wrong things, as dead-on as it may be within its pathetic little gamut.  Of course, it's just my personal opinion, but I don't understand why ANY gay men feel that this is a positive thing.  I hate vapid idiots in real life and I hate them on Showtime.  I DO have to concede, however, that as far as ""bourgeois"" acceptance of homosexuality goes, any sort of representation is better than no sort at all; and shows like this, or ""Will and Grace,"" or ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" really have helped to drag the ""gay issue"" out of the closet.  But the next step will be to have a gay character who's not an obnoxious, buck-toothed, flaming Peter Pan, or a catty, mincing, home-interiors-obsessed dandy, or a conceited sexaholic label-whore, or what have you.  I can't help but feel that this is sort of the ""minstrel show"" phase of our portrayal in pop culture.  At any rate, I can't watch any more ""QAF,"" nor can I listen to any more monotonous gay house remixes of crappy songs by ""divas"" off the soundtrack.  Not that I'd rather watch sports!
P.S. I also understand that I have probably come off as somewhat of a ""basher"" of my own people, but I really don't mean that at all.  I'm quite happy being gay (lol) and even though I don't think it's necessarily a ""choice,"" I WOULD choose it if it were.  I'm fairly shocked when I come up against lingering bigotry, but the politics of the moment make it crystal clear that it's still a very real issue.  It just seems to me that shows like ""Queer As Folk"" give Jesse Helms a little bit too much to chew on.  At this point it's not even ""shocking"" to see sleazy, gratuitous, redundant gay sex choreography on Showtime - it's just pathetic, and it's doing nothing positive for our image.  Not that it's the responsibility of TV shows to arbitrate morals - god forbid!  And like I said, I fully support everybody's right to free expression.  I just feel like somebody needs to be saying ""But there's more!"" - even if there often isn't.",1083369600,50,5132,4.538545059717698

1656670,5,B00005RIY5,"""Queer As Folk"" is a great adaptation of the British version of the same name.  This revolutionary US version started in 2000 and caused a great frenzy in the GLBT community.  Before its debut on Showtime, only ""Will And Grace"" and ""Ellen"" explored GLBT lifestyles to this magnitude.  However, the producers riskingly pushed everything further.  This offers one of the most unique shows in television history.  Its success deservingly continues to amaze audiences today.  Though the majority of viewers are GLBT, the straight/ally community will also be entertained.
This is one of the few shows that explores graphic realities of such lifestyles.  The highly daring scenes deserve the cast and crew tremendous respect for doing what no other television show has done, namely the nudity and the sex scenes.  Though not every GLBT individual lives those despicted lifestyles in real life, the issues are expressed wonderfully: coming out, child care, gay bashing, HIV/AIDS, and more.  Many can unfortunately relate to these.  Its hardcore impact offers an unforgettable experience.  Every suspenseful detail always leaves audiences anxiously awaiting for what will happen next.  The spectacular Babylon club scenes offer the added viewing pleasure.  Such show quality keeps every episode at its top.  Once anyone starts watching, they instantly become addicted.
Gale Harold, Hal Sparks, Randy Harrison, Peter Paige, Scott Lowett, Thea Gill, Michelle Clunie, and Sharon Gless are only some of the ""Queer As Folk"" stars.  Though a few episodes has not-so-perfect acting in one or two scenes, their unique presence makes up for it.  The hardcore dramatic scenes are always as emotional as real life.  They prove that they researched the individual issue before performing it.  All the different personalities blend perfectly as great variety: hot and sexually active, boyishly cute and child in heart, flamboyant and self-identified queen, wallflower and shy, and more.  The individuals perform their personality wonderfully.  Their own sense of drama and humor also blend perfectly.
The long cast list allows a broad range of issues to be expressed.  Those who just began watching this show will see Justin beginning to come out, Lindsay giving birth to Gus (Melanie is the second mother, Brian is the father), Michael still managing the market, and of course Brian being Brian.  The chain of events lead to a powerful cliffhanger in the season finale.  This DVD compilation shows partly how the characters and the show has evolved to today.
""Queer As Folk"" is great for those looking for something daring, unique, and powerful.  This is destined to be remembered for a long time.  Fans of the show are also recommended Season 2 and Season 3.  Such combination offers the experience of a lifetime.(...)",1080432000,4,2799,5.261851015801354

Although straight people can enjoy this, there are some very graphic sex scenes, but hey, I can watch Sex and the City, so...
Anyways I truly think that this will make a great collection to your dvd's especially if you are a Queer As Folk fan. This is really a break through in Queer TV.",1077062400,,607,4.196581196581197

But slowly, you'll see that Queer As Folk, US, develops a life of its own, borrowing less and less from UK, injecting more and more of its own, becoming itself. And that is when it gets totally fun, and real. This ones takes a few episodes to get off the ground, to be honest, but once it does, you'll find yourself saying, ""All Night, Full on, come on!"". Except, the UK version has so many full frontal nudity, while this version, you'll find but glimpses.
The UK's cocky lead, Stuart Alan Jones, is far more engaging and arrestingly ... than the US's lead.
For those who's never seen the UK version, see this or all that it is. You'll love it, be you ... For those who have, give this a chance, eventually, by season 2, it's become more original.

1656673,5,B00005RIY5,"""Queer as Folk"" must be one of the most daring series ever brought to TV in the United States (as it was in the UK for the original series). I admire the producers of the first season for their guts and willpower to bring this project to completion.
The DVD is nothing short of a collector's item if only because this series is already a classic. The series, of course, are phenomenal. The first few episodes are based on the UK script, but the story was extended (and changed), for which we should be grateful. The US actors are enormously talented (this can not be said for some actors in the UK series), which makes the series all the more enjoyable to watch.
Essentially, the story is a soap opera. It just happens to focus on gay people and it just happens to contain a lot of sex. Neither of which are bad, in my opinion. TV needs much more diversity - it is entertainment after all, and should be a reflection of life and all its glories. What is surprising (for US TV) is not that the sex is gay sex, but quite how explicitly it's shown. But that isn't the most important aspect. The characters are. Because the characters are captivating and real, a viewer gets hooked on them and the story. And this is the real value of the series.
The DVD provides additional entertainment - apart the obvious capability for frame by frame replay (forgive me, I couldn't resist), it also has some extras on it. Hal (David) talks us through some scenes that were cut, and you get little interview clips of the actors, biographies of the characters and more.
It's one of those things you can watch over and over again, without getting bored. Perfect for several rainy days or a long winter ....",1064361600,4,1687,4.445161290322581

1656694,4,B00005RIY5,"Addicted after watching the pilot episode, it did not take me long to cruise through the first season of
QUEER AS FOLK on DVD. Kudos to Showtime for airing this daring and provocative show following the lives of five gay men in Pittsburgh. It certainly takes guts in the midst of the Conservative Christian Front moving across the United States. Behind the frank sexual scenes real issues affecting the gay community are portrayed: gay bashing, drug abuse, outing, and AIDS just to name a few.
Brian Kinney is a man you love to hate. Being a sexual predator and avid drug user he is all out for himself and has virtual no regards for others, yet he constantly has a following of devoted friends surrounding him. Justin is the high school baby fag who loves to thrust is sexuality in everyones face while chasing after Brian. Micheal is Brians best friend since high school and a comic book collector. Ted is an accountant who is low on self-esteem. Emmett is the flaming fashion diva who has enough self-worth for both Ted and himself. All five meet regularly at the gym/diner/Babylon to discuss their daily problems while cruising the gorgeous men around them. They are the epitome of gay male culture: anonymous sex and obsession with the perfect male body while drinking and using drugs.
Although QUEER AS FOLK is revolutionary its not perfect. Randy Harrisons (Justin) acting ability can be improved and Hall Sparks (Michael) does have a tendency to whine and complain. More disturbing, the constant battering of lesbians is very worrying and taxing. Each character pokes fun of lesbians but doesnt hesitate to rely on their help in dire times of need. No wonder many of my lesbian friends refuse to watch this show. Hopefully Showtime will redeem themselves in January when they begin airing THE L WORD.",1062979200,2,1808,4.835483870967742

YES the show is QUEER indeed AS you FOLK may, whether you're gay or straight. It is a celebrated show dedicated to all the homo living proof and been-there-done-it everywhere in this world. Whether you kiss our feet or diss our face, you look around and see or hear the same stories, more or less in life of a different colour or culture background.
Brian (Gale Harold) is the only sexy, rich and vain ""top"" promiscuously dominating character of the quartet gang. Michael (Hal Sparks) is the best friend since high school, sensitive and a comics freak with an inferiosity complex. Emmett (Peter Paige) is the proudest, outest member of the group, done-it-all flamboyant and drama princess. Ted (Scott Lowett) is a professional decent accountant but a looser in sex life. Linsay (Thea Gill) mothers childhood pal Brian's baby and refuse to live under shadow with her Jewish lover and ""hubby"" Melanie (Michelle Clunie).
I am a mixed of Michael and Emmett and Ted so I can fully understand what the shows has got to offer and mean for PLU in this new millennium of TV shows.
Well done and cheers to SHOWTIME!",1060041600,5,1551,4.542857142857143
1656696,5,B00005RIY5,"Screw the gay stereotypes, this show comes more close to realistic than anything else on TV dealing with the gay community. From AIDs to self-denial, this season covers alot of what gays go through in their lives. I think there's a character here for everyone to relate to, although I find that I can relate to a little bit of every character. Not only is the show dramatic & can make you cry, it's so halarious. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a QAF addict. In my free time, when I come home late at night, I watch Queer As Folk. It's relaxing & entertaining & the cast is amazing. Sharon Gless adds so much fun to the show as big-hearted Debbie. I love these DVDs. The special commentary episodes are amazing & it's fun to learn about the making of the show. The other features are nice bonuses too, although I love just being able to watch this great show whenever I want. I love it, period. I don't see how anyone couldn't love this show, especially the gay community. After watching a few episodes, I gaurentee you will be addicted. So buy this...and never stop watching it.",1060041600,4,1079,4.4
1656697,5,B00005RIY5,"Review by Lyn Carr, Denver, Colorado. USA
Loved the Queer as Folks DVD set, and the hours of extra goodies on number six.  What more is there to say about this series, slick or not.  It's great and so are the DVD's, especially the inclusion of what the music is and who did it on each disc.
Gary Palmer, a reviewer, said, ""This episode,(first season finale) more than any other, amounts to a near-perfect combination of music, character development and dramatic action, and is without question the most heartbreaking hour of television this reviewer has ever seen."" Ditto, my man, ditto.
What leads up to it is a must see
This set is a keeper!!!",1059523200,2,645,4.6
1656698,5,B00005RIY5,"I love this show! I love all the characters and I especially love Brian and Justin. The story lines in this series are great! I am a great fan of Six Feet Under and could never think that any other show could be as good, but I think it has been surpassed by Queer as Folk! The great thing about this show is that you don't have to be gay in order to understand all of it. All the things happening to these characters are things that happen in every relationship regardless of gender. That's what TV needs! Something that can apply to everyone but at the same time open the eyes of people who are ignorant when it comes to the differences of others. If you are reading this for advice about whether or not to watch or buy....DO IT! After the very first episode you are hooked! I was!",1059523200,5,782,4.185430463576159
1656699,3,B00005RIY5,"I have to admit having a love-hate relationship with this series.  Yes, it's brave and a fresh perspective on urban singles.  But the writing disappoints me most of the time.  With Richard Kramer as head writer I expect the quality of drama he brought to his ""thirtysomething""  and ""My So-Called Life"" episodes.  But if you're going to compare this to an 80's show - this is a lot closer to Dallas than the finely observed characters in Kramer's previous series.  Still, the acting is consistently excellent.  Gale Harold never falters in layering Brian with intelligence, love, and sexual mystique.  Hal Sparks, formerly a talk show host / comedian, is vulnerable and passionate as Michael, often revealing more of the character in his eyes than is found in the dialog.  You want to like these people and find out what happens to them.  But, time and again the writing falls back on clichs, good guys and bad guys, and telegraphs a ""lesson"" with each episode.  I want this to be as good as HBO's ""Six Feet Under"", but alas, the writing just isn't there.  Still, I watch.  Hoping.",1057363200,3,1080,4.711229946524064
1656700,4,B00005RIY5,"I watched the pilot episode on television, didn't care for it, and then forgot all about this series until this year, when I was amazed at the depth in the writing and acting.
So...I bought the first season. What a roller-coaster ride! You can tell these actors (and writers) are trying to define themselves through all the changes, crises, and relationships.
The storyline involving Michael and Dr. David was so compelling, romantic and realistic.  You could tell the producers realized they had a winner with Chris Potter (David)- extending the stay of a seemingly two episode character into a whole season. He just ""electrified"" each scene he walked into. It broke my heart to watch his and Michael's relationship progress, knowing it couldn't possibly work out. They need to find a way to bring that guy back!
Sharon Gless brings so much joy into a series that can be so dark. She plays over-the-top with authenticity and grace.",1057017600,2,932,4.89873417721519

I award this series full marks for writing, acting, direction.  And the sex scenes are far more daring than I'd ever imagined they would be, without being too gratuitous.  Perhaps the producers of ""Queer as Folk USA"" (as we call it) could come over to Britain and show our TV producers how to make a decent show.  Most of our TV dramas stink!
This DVD set is a must have.  I've watched the whole of the first series twice now, and I love it!

1656714,5,B00005RIY5,"I rate Queer As Folks the best show ever for many reasons.
I am 21 years old gay male. For a long time, ""our"" lifestyle has been hidden from the society's eyes and people has the tendency of hiding their sexual preferences afraid of one and all. Queer As Folks open the door for people to see is all right and whoever is afraid, of such feeling, see they are not alone and not to be afraid to live their lifestyle preferences just because of homophobics. (I know I don't care about what others think or say and sure know I won't stop living my feelings).
In the show, makes it seem its all about sex ( But who doesn't think about sex). I am in a steady relationship since I was 19 and Queer as Folks for many is a dream come true on TV (Well I should speak for myself). Meaning even though we ""found"" that special someone to share your ""life"" with, there's a lot out there. You will always find guys/ girls that will call your attention and in reality it would be up to you to decide whether take it or not.
The Show also gives a good example if you live in a sex active life... ""Always Use Condoms"".
Also deals with peerpresure, parents not accepting their child or accepting too much, ""friends"" that will always be there or not.
Also, the show shows there is no limits for love even if someone has HIV, Love is possible and also even if someone hurts you or just goes around not caring for a relationship, Love still there. and the frustation of being affraid which many of US went and goes through making us even try to go ""STRAIGHT"". (Like that would happen).
There's so much. If you are curious, just take a peak.",1049846400,2,1618,4.239482200647249
1656715,4,B00005RIY5,"Showtime's boast of ""no limits"" certainly applies to its hugely successful ""Queer As Folk"" series. While certainly not the first series on American TV to portray gay life, no other has been as bold and daring in its sexual content and just what gay sex and gay life is all about. Set in Pittsburgh, the series evolves around four long-time gay companions, the Wonder bread-faced Michael (Hal Sparks) and the resident stud for whom Michael carries a flaming (no pun) torch, Brian (Gale Harold), and their two buddies, the out-and-proud-of-it Emmett (Peter Paige) and the self-unassured Ted (Scott Lowell). A fifth newcomer to the conclave is introduced in Episode 1 when Brian gets it on with 17-year-old Justin, a kid 12 years his junior. After a night of drugs and sex with Justin, Brian gets a call that he's become a father with lesbian friend Lindsay, who's in a relationship with lawyer lover Melanie. How Brian, a gay guy, comes to be a dad is explained pretty simply by Brian: he ""jerked off"" in a Dixie cup. From there, ""Queer As Folk"" takes us to the blossoming romance between Brian and Justin (though Brian will never admit it), Michael finding who he hopes will be the man of his dreams and Emmett and Ted still looking. Through it all, the voice of logic is Michael's mother, Debbie, played to the hilt by an amazing Sharon Gless. By season's end, we've got a pretty good handle on the development of each of the series' main characters, an abundance of gay and lesbian sex and, beyond that, a sense of gay life. Critics have questioned if the show is a realistic protrayal of gay life, but a couple of plot lines smacked of real life, like Brian coming to terms with the death of his estranged father. One bit of silliness, though, was Emmett's misguided shot at converting to heterosexualism through some self-help group. But the realism of the season finale is maybe all too real. As in real life all too often, Justin falls victim to a hate crime of violence, and its reality is nothing less than a jolt. All in all, not a bad first season, and we might even like to know some of the series' leads a little more.",1047513600,,2129,4.575916230366492

1656718,5,B00005RIY5,"I distinctly remember my elation when I first viewed the original UK version of Queer As Folk'. For one of the first times, our lives were the storylines and we were being shown in an honest way - just as human beings living our lives the best way we know how. Sometimes brutally honest though - some of the subject matter even made me cringe! But it was positive as the stereotypical views of the gay man and woman were being challenged.
Then news started filtering out that the US were planning on making their own version of QAF. Alot of people, me included, were very sceptical about this. The US doesn't have a high success rate when taking a successful UK format and developing it for US audiences.
So when the first season on Showtime's Queer As Folk began airing in Australia in June 2002, I didn't have the elation that I felt with the UK version. And when I actually began watching the first episode, I was appalled. I thought 'this is one bad show'. Obviously being a fan of the UK version, the characters, actors and settings were fresh in my mind and it was  natural to compare. And the US version came off a very poor second.
But I continued watching, as I was advised by a friend that it gets better. After the first 3 episodes, my opinion hadn't changed. The storylines were almost identical to the UK version, even some of the dialogue was identical. But then something happened. The original UK storylines were diverged and new ones added and it started to become a whole new show. Where the UK version finished,the characters were developed  within such wonderful, honest sotrylines that I also became elated at this version of Queer As Folk. So persistance does pay.
What can I say about the US s1 Queer As Folk that hasn't been said before? Not everyone likes the show. Obviously due to the content and graphic nature, it will offend people. Even some gay people are appalled by the show. But personally I love it. It depicts a group of gay men and women living their lives, making choices - not always the right choices, but dealing with the consequences. In other words, the characters are more human because they are flawed, just like every human being in this world. The content can be graphic, and sometimes offensive (even to gays),as  the lifestyle can be shown in it's most brutally honest way. I also appreciate how the principle  cast aren't the usual 'classic' gay looking men you see in magazine shoots - neither beefed up muscle men or nancy queens, but ordinary, everyday gays who in their own way are just as physically beautiful as what is depicted in the media.
Now onto the DVD - it amazes me how the actual DVD and the special features hardly get a mention in reviews. Afterall, that's why alot of people buy DVD's!!!! Well, the QAF DVD doesn't disappoint. It is wonderfully packaged in a fold out  case with stunning  photography of the cast adorning the sleek design. The special features are wonderful - you can tell that considerable effort was made to offer something extra special to fans of the show.
Firstly there are three 'special edition' episodes. Here 'special edition' means the episode with an audio commentary. But the presentation of the commentary is very unique. When one of the actors or producers comments an what's happening on screen, the screen splits in 2 with the scene on one side and the actor/producer  shown on the other. A wonderful idea, and one which works brilliantly. Often with commentaries that have many people speaking, it is sometimes hard to tell who is speaking. But here, there is no such problem and it is a joy to watch their expression as they describe their work .Many facinating facts are divulged here also.
Next there is the'bonus features' section on disc 6. Contained here are deleted scenes - all introduced by Hal Sparks who gives indication as to why the scene wasn't used. Hal is a very funny guy who never seems to take himself seriously, and it is very entertaining to watch him 'be himself'. Then comes the 'outtakes' - mainly actors bursting into fits of laughter and fluffing their lines, but nonetheless it's hilarious!!!! Only several minutes long though - in my opinion outtakes are the best feature of any DVD so more is always better! Following on is the section dealing with 'meeting' the characters, actors and executive producers. Mainly written screens of text, but all very readable and entertaining. There is a link to a short video for each actor/producer and whilst these are interesting, they are far too short. Still this section is highly entertaining and gives some extra facts on the characters that you may not know.
The rest of the bonus features comprise trailers and 'sneek peeks' for upcoming seasons. These can be interesting to overseas viewers to see how the show is promoted on air in the US. A moving picture gallery set to music rounds out the extras here (there is also a DVD rom link, but I was unable to access it).
What a wonderful world it is when there is technology like DVD available where we can not only own our favourite TV show to watch whenever and as many times as we like, but also get to explore behind the scenes with (hopefully) a good set of bonus features. Queer As Folk may be too 'far out' to ever be nominated for mainstream awards, and it may be a low budget show on cable that is mainly of interest to gays', but everyone who works on this show should be extremely proud for making such a cutting edge, brutally honest view of the gay world.",1040342400,14,5496,4.60776302349336
1656719,5,B00005RIY5,"This is one of the most amazing series I have ever seen! Don't be put off if you're not gay (I'm not!) because you will really miss out. QAF has to be the greatest and most explicit exploration yet, and although some may believe that the USA was not ready for this explosive look at gay life, we certainly are!
This is a MUST for ANYONE who has seen QAF and indeed anyone who hasn't!
If you have seen the UK version and liked that, and if you have seen the UK version and HATED that, you'll LOVE this.
I definately recommend this to anyone who loves drama, comedy, love, glitz, and a splashing of real life.

I have seen Season One first via Morpheus downloads, but bought the DVD-set as well, cause many Episodes were in bad quality.
I like the relationship between Michael and David and all the up and downs.
But I was sad that the really cool intros especially those few with Harvey Fierstein e.g. Episode9 or super cool intro of Episode 18 ""... sit down, relaX - We'll take care of you ! ! !"" were not on the DVD-set. VERY SAD!!!
The Extras are also OK, maybe some more Bloopers and some more ""Behind the Scenes""-Scenes would fully complete the set.

This is the greatest show to come out in years.  It's about time we saw something like this.  I loved it so much I got it on DVD and I keep watching it over and over.  It's doesn't get boring even though I know what is going to happen.  It is also thought provoking.  I can't get Cable ot DSL were I live so I depend on them putting it out on VHS or DVD.  I'm still waiting for 2nd Season to become available.  Once it's available all things set aside and I'm ordering it.  Above anything else.  I was so glad that they showed scenes from Season 2 on the 1st Season DVD.  I was getting really upset and wanted to see how Justin came out of being bashed in the head by Chris Hobbs.  Now I want to see what the courts do to Chris.  From the end of the first season I can tell the Bryan does have some feelings for Justin he just will not admit it.  It's not in his character to.  If anyone hasn't seen this you got to.  It is underrated at #5 it is above a 5.  It beats ""Sex In The City"" by far.

These folk are so real and funny! I find myself laughing out loud every few minutes during the shows.  My ""used-to-be"" against gays hubby even has started watching this show with me and although he doesn't agree with everything he sees, he is beginning to accept gay lifestyles as a real love. Real men, real women who have the same kind of problems that straight people do. Along with a few others.
I think this show does open some closed minds and if others would just give it a chance, they would absolutely LOVE it like I do.

Brian is so deliciously nasty you have to love him and Justin is such a little cutie. Emmett is a riot all the time. He reminds me so much of a lot of my friends. Some people complain that he is a stereotypical sissy, but so many of my friends are just like him. He is fun and energetic, definitely what being Gay is all about. The show is sexy and smart. The writers and directors are right on the money with the storylines. Debbie is the perfect mother that every gay man wants and fears at the same time. Some of the episodes have made me roll with laughter and some have almost broke my heart. I can't wait for the second season to be released on DVD as well. Everyone Gay man in the world should own this series.
Sure the sex is gratuitous sometimes, but hey we deserve to see some great Gay sex scenes on TV. The world of straight sex is pushed down our throats everyday in so many shows. It's time we got some equal screen time.
For those negative ones that love to write nasty and bashing reviews of the show, I would ask you this: Are you actually Gay? If so lighten up and live a little.

The actor who plays him, Gale Harold, is extremely attractive. The relationships that form between the main friends has so many twists and their lives and interactions are at times shocking and visceral. It is almost like watching a train wreck and not being able to tear yourself away. I find it interesting that this series especially appeals to heterosexual women such as myself. Even though the characters are gay they are still so appealing. There are poignant moments and campy moments and even many moments that you can find in your own life. Sharon Gless plays the PFLAG waving mama with such pizazz. In fact most of the characters are endearing but all with their own unique flaws which only make them more believable.

Sometimes there is some great dialogue and other times not. But, seriously folks, it is fun, entertaining, and filled with ""eye candy"" for an open minded straight and/or gay audience to enjoy. I bought it because it is breaking the mold of ""straight"" entertainment that gives you a different perceptive on life in our ever-changing world.

The first few episodes lead one to believe that the show will focus on the ""fast lane"" club-gays, but ultimately each of the characters gets side-tracked into other areas of gay life, so that by the end of the series there are at least glimpses of other aspects of the community.  Since I'm not a Showtime subscribers, I don't know anything about the second season yet, but I hope this trend to a more diversified picture of gay life will continue.",1027814400,,744,4.496296296296296

Let me tell you how, the American version takes a deeper look into the relationships between the chatacters and lets you decide for yourself why you should care about them.  And let me tell you something at times you do wonder why you care, but that's because each charater is made so wonderfully human.  You get the feeling that you've at one time or another met at least one of these people, or at times have done things similar to them.  What drew me in and hooked me wasn't the sex, but the center realtionsip of Michael and Brian. I found myself understanding why Michael puts up with some of the things he does concerning his best friend, and you're given glimpses into why Brian acts the way he does.  Some of the secondary story lines didn't work out that well but you forgive it because what does work, works fantastically, and wonderously well.  If you come to this looking for a comemtary on all gay life you won't get it.  This is about a specific gruop of gay friends and how they live their lives and how they deal with the situations that come up in everyday life.  It's about love, respect, friendship and the power these things have.  It's about how someone can say one thing and mean another, its about how who we think we are is sometimes not who we really are.  Its about how your life keeps moving while you're still making plans.  Its about the subtle and not so subtle adjustments we make in order to live our lives.  Its about compramise and standing firm, its about holding on and letting go.  And in the end its basically about when the world is crumbling around you who you call to stop the madness.",1027728000,,1727,4.410094637223975
1656763,1,B00005RIY5,"I was very disappointed after viewing the first episodes of this serie. I originally bought it because I just LOVED the British serie, and as that one was quite short (only 3 CDs), I was thinking ""Wow, the US one has about 20 hours of it...""
Well...
The characters of the US version are but caricatures of the British caracters, they are flat, shallow, and unattractive, their relationships are very simple, and in case you wouldn't understand who likes whom and why, other caracters state it for you; the storyline seems to have been seriously simplified. The whole thing is done to make sure that even the dumbest audience can follow the plot. Any subtle humour has been removed or heavily higlighted, to the point that, after the first two episode, I though it was actually one of these caricatural remakes of the original serie.
The only ""non-negative"" addition, although it was not necessary : the lesbian side of this little community has been re-inforced (in number and in intensity), probably to keep the whole thing more ""politically correct"".
And for nudity (which was one of the reasons why the original TV serie was so controversial at the time) : don't hold your breath...
""Very disappointed"" summarises it quite well...",1027555200,11,1233,4.876190476190477

I find it hard to stop myself from gushing about this program, but it really is just that good!

I have enjoyed watching the actors characters evolve from humble beginings through to thought provoking people that have, at times, left me speechless and unprepeared for what happens next.
There is a charachter in ""Queer as Folk"" that we can all relate to gay or straight and I believe that it is about time that America, which, tends to be technically very conservative has surprised me with the running of this series (which was made in Canada).
Gale Harold has bought life to his ""Brian"" and his relationship with a young Randy Harrison was thrilling to see portrayed. Hal Sparks was amazing as the carer of the group and it was good to see someone as talanted as Sharon Gless come on board and portray her sense of warmth that no other actor would of be able carry for the length of the series and in to a second and maybe third.
The question remains for me, now that the the tears from the first series have dried, when and where will I be able to buy the second series on DVD as we are only upto episode three on TV here and I no it will be along wait between series.",1026777600,14,1283,4.327800829875518

The best thing about this show is that it deals with such a variety of issues and gives the viewer such a diverse look at homosexual life. I recommend this A LOT, to the GLBT community to see yourself in it, and to the straight community to help you let go of some of your misconceptions. Buy it!",1026432000,,542,4.027777777777778
1656769,5,B00005RIY5,"That's exactly the point of this groundbreaking achievement in television- to convey the idea that being queer is no big deal! It makes homosexual sex part of mainstream viewing and serves to break down barriers that face homosexuals in society. As the series opens, the sex is 'in your face,' but viewers are quick to realize that sex is secondary here; it is merely an aspect of the lives of these characters, which are extremely well-written, developed, and acted. Sexy Gale Harold plays Brian Kinney, the object of everyone's affection and desire. Harold's talent and sex appeal have solidified the show's success. Hal Sparks plays Michael, the cute, ""boy next door"" type who has an overly-supportive mother. The role of Justin, the 17 year old man in a boy's body, is played by Randy Harris. Scott Lowell (Ted) and the beautiful Peter Paige, who plays Emmett, the ""Queen"" of the group, rounds out the cast of friends. Thea Gill and Michelle Clunie also join the cast as a lesbian couple finding their way through commitment and parenthood. The relationships created in this series are a welcomed dose of reality and emotion. Audiences of all types can find themselves enjoying the drama and comedy that combine as a perfect recipe for brilliant television. My only hope is that the success of this series pushes writers, directors, and actors to demand more of this type of material to work with. And homophobes BEWARE! Gale Harold can put even the straightest men in touch with their gay side.",1026432000,6,1499,4.882352941176471

Then, the more avid of a watcher I became, I noticed the heart of the show.

When I first heard about QAF, I was VERY sceptical, because I was sure that it would just be sex and be superficial. A friend of mine introduced me to it in June, when I watched one of the second season episodes. I was hooked and bought the first season DVD. Each character is so wonderful and there are all kinds in Queer as Folk. You do have some, like Brian Kinney, who go around dancing every night and having every guy he can get, but that is not true for most of the rest of the group. And people like Michael and David who are showing the world that two men can have a relationship. The show demonstrates that gay couples deal with many of the same issues as other couples and EVERYTHING is dealt with on this show. Some might say there is too much sex, but many gay men have sex, and hey we're men. But beyond the sex, you have wonderful story lines depicting so many issues. Just watching Justin and his mother interact and deal with Justin's honesty is spectacular.

I may not be a critic, but I was a theatre major and I feel like it is at least as well acted and written as any show on tv.  It may not show gay life as it really is, but it is tv.  No tv show portrays life as it really is, because life, gay or straight, as it really is would be boring to watch. Dysfunctional people are interesting people.
Unfortunately because we live in a homophobic society many people will miss out on a really great show. I also think its sad that people feel like they have to pick apart the writing and acting. I guess it's not cool to unabashedly give a show rave reviews these days. But I would recommend this show to anyone who wanted something really good to watch.",1023235200,6,853,4.083832335329341

1656776,4,B00005RIY5,"QAF (as it is also known) is a fun little Showtime series based on a BBC television series of the same name.  This compilation of the first season of Showtime's version follows the BBC's plotline almost word for word, with a few exceptions.
Queer as Folk follows the lives of a group of men and women who just happen to be gay and living in Philadelphia (although the series is filmed in Canada).  Without intending to pigeonhole any of the characters into two dimensional formats (because they are not portrayed as such), you have:  Brian (self centered beautiful man-boy, who is completely without emotion); Michael (Brian's childhood friend, who has pined after Brian for his whole life to no avail.  He is a comic book nerd who works in a discount department store); Emmett (out and proud, but not in your face gay man, who lives his life to suit himself, not answering to anyone); Ted (plain jane accountant who would love to be hot and sexy, but isn't); Justin (17 year old who sneaks out into the gay world to experience what he knows is his true self; he falls in love with Brian); Debbie (Michael's heterosexual mother - played brilliantly by Sharon Gless - who is proud and loving of her gay son); Lindsay (chilhood friend of Brian's and mother to his son.  She is a lesbian who is an art teacher); Melanie (Lindsay's lover of 6 years and a very forceful and smart attorney).
While the first season of QAF was dictated by the script of the BBC's version the producers did take some liberties.  The show is a straight forward look at gay life from the perspective of these characters.  It makes no apologies to anyone for the reality of their lives.  This includes drug use, nudity, sex, language, amongst others.
The first season is quite excellent because it follows the formula laid down by the British series.  However, in the second season, QAF has begun to get a bit too ""in your face"" even for some serious hard core homosexuals.
Rent or buy this first season and you will see some really dynamite acting and scripting that will keep you involved from beginning to end.",1022544000,10,2085,4.613513513513514

Melanie and Lindsey add a bit of female perspective, and the challenge to Brian to be a ""dad"".  From Episode 1's opening scene in Babylon to the heart-wrenching Season Finale, this series completely draws you in and keeps you wanting more.

I hope this shows continues for many years as it highlights everyday problems regardless of a person's sexuality that we all go through. I give the cast and crew 5 stars for the their belief in the show and the importance of making it, I can only hope that this show will somehow make the world a better place, by challenging people's misconceptions about gay and bi people and realise that everyone wants someone to love them no matter what their sexual orientaion is.
I love all the characters, including Brian, because I understand them all and where they are coming from and I cannot wait for the 2nd series of QAF be released on Dvd so I can own a copy of that series too.
I do not think it is really important if some or all the actors are gay, what is important is to be apart of this Brillant show and know that in some small way they are making the world a better place, I for one are so grateful for that.",1020902400,,1075,4.099526066350711

1656811,5,B00005RIY5,"Me and many of my friends who watched and are addicted to QAF agree that it's equally annoying and entertaining.  The characters are badly written and at times unbearably stupid.  Nevertheless, once you start watching it you can't stop.  The first few eposodes are really bad: a bad remake of the original series, bad acting, offensive homophobic diologues, etc.  Fortunately, it gets better with every episode.  And so you will fall in love with the characters despite all the unrealistic things they do.
The cast is very good looking.  Acting is mediocre.  Music is amazing.  The show is very well shot.  It's clear that Showtime spends a generous amount of money on producing QAF.
Finally, I'd like to say that even though many many many things about QAF are bad, we as a gay community don't have a lot to choose from (yet).  So I don't want to sound to picky.  And everyone I know including myself enjoyed the first season very much. Too bad they couldn't hire an all gay-cast to help out some struggling openly gay actors.",1020384000,,1027,4.681564245810056

The language is foul but it is funny, entertaining & engaging. I had the benefit of watching the entire 22  first season episodes in 4 nights (not consectutive nights). The characters are very likable & middle class in their values with one exception.
 In their universe they rarely have to deal with the straight world. Bosses, doctors, lawyers, clients, bussiness associates-
all gay. With the emotional growth of the main characters, I look forward to the second season.",1018915200,,598,4.852941176470588
1656816,5,B00005RIY5,"First off, I'd like to say that QAF is is one of the best television shows on the air, period.  The characters' personalities are all very interesting & diverse, and the writers do a great job of balancing the fun & frivolous pursuits of everyday life (& every nightlife!) with the deeper and more complex issues that many of us face today.  Everyone, whether gay or strait, will be able to relate to many of the issues and situations that arise during the course of the first season.
With that said though, if you lack an open mind, or you're not OK with nudity or steamy sex scenes: STEER CLEAR!  Part of the show's charm is its unapologetic realism and refusal to 'pull any punches'; and, yes, that means lots of graphic gay sex.
That brings me to a small problem I have with the review submitted by my fellow Massachusetts native Titus.  While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and and I respect those who are willing to expess them, I can't help but think that his may be a little short-sighted and somewhat uninformed.  First off, the legal age of consent in many states, including Massachusetts, is 17 therefore negating his statutory rape argument.  (I will admit though, that I'm not sure about Pennsylvania law.  The show takes place in Pittsburg.)  The whole dynamic between 29 year old Brian and 17 year old Justin is a major plot issue which is addressed throughout the whole first season.  As the show goes on both characters evolve and it becomes very clear that Justin is anything but a naive little boy.  If Titus had continued to watch the series, he would have realized that there is more to the relationship than an older man 'taking advantage' of a younger teen.  Also, considering that his past reviews consist of: 'Martin Luther: The Christian Between God and Death', 'The Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc', 'Jesus of Nazareth', and 'Ben-Hur', its seems to me that the graphic story of a bunch of young gay men might be a little outside his realm.  (Please don't take that comment as an affront to Christianity or a generalization about Christians being close-minded.  I happen to be Catholic, and it wasn't meant that way at all.)  But if Mr. Titus is really so concerned with the rape of young boys, I'd suggest he address the horrors uncovered within the Archdiocese of Boston instead of calling a high quality fictional drama ""abhorrent to anyone with an iota of moral decency"" without exploring the plot further and then looking at the bigger picture.
Anyway, I strongly urge any of you who have not seen an episode to give it a shot.  I bet you'll find yourself totally addicted by the end of the first disc.",1018828800,,2650,4.62046908315565
1656817,5,B00005RIY5,"This is a great DVD boxed set of the series Queer as Folks. Here in Australia this series would never get aired even on cable. It certainly covers a wide range of situations in the gay culture. Most importantly that the situations we find ourselves in love, happiness, morality and friendship are activity in gay or straight life.  I have shared the experience of the show with my mate and we cried at the end. We both have learned one special thing and that is how proud we are to be gay in this crazy world. The actors do a great job and we love them all. It is a credit to the producers of the show for being so direct about gay life where one has to choose where one fits into this culture. This show is an education and is rare insight into this world. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry but best of all it will make you happy. I have also brought the CD which is great to listen to in the car. I do hesitate in recommending this show to anyone as it is value for money.",1018656000,3,985,4.025510204081633
1656818,4,B00005RIY5,"First off, let me say that this show is not for everyone. All political Right Wing nutcases should not watch this show. Even some queers will, and do, find this show full of sterotypes. Which it does, but guess what, go to any gay bar in any major city in the US alone, and you'll find that this show really hits the bullseye on many things. The current gay scene is very narcisistic, like it or not. And if anyone ever goes to a Pride Parade, or to Halsted Market Days here in Chicago, you'll see that it's a time for the buffed boys to strip half naked and show off their bodies -plus what they do every Friday and Saturday night. So Queer As Folk focuses on this a bit too much, but their is not much drama in showing a bunch of queens sitting around watching E! Entertainments Oscar coverage. The acting ranges from the brilliant -Sharon Gless, Gale Harold, Peter Page -to the pedantic -it's good Randy Harrison is pretty, cause he can't act- but overall the show represents a fair slice of gay life. But like a true soap opera it is, some of some its story lines are not perfect, such as the much talked about ""gay conversion"" Emmet goes through. While I like David and Michael, the whole relationship was doomed from the beginning, mostly because the writers made it very obvious, thus no real drama. But the things that do work -only because it is true, is the way the characters obsession with working out. Do I think the show sends a negative message? Perhaps, but like Ted, I'm a bit cynical and see people as they really are, which is shallow. I may have low self-esteem, but there is a lot of truth about the gay community in Ted's rants. But I digress. QAF is next stage in TV drama. What the major networks have to do, is watch what cable is doing. Oz, Sex and the City, The Sapranos, Resurrection Blvd, StarGate SG 1 -drama and comedy that may stretch the envelope, but break up the image of the same cop shows the networks have been putting out since Dragnet and the same comedy we've seen since Lucy. The networks claim that they need to reach a large group of people, that these cable shows have an ambition that is too lofty for a broad-based audience. I disagree. These shows can work, if given the time to grow, and if networks won't back away from the Right. QAF represents a right step in the direction (though it's not perfect) for all gay men and to a lesser extent, lesbian women.",1018656000,,2406,4.360801781737194
1656833,3,B00005RIY5,"I may be in the minority here, but I find the US version of ""Queer as Folk"" offensive in its portrayals of gay men as drug addicted dancing queens.  Unlike its British counterpart, which at least balanced such characters out with other less stereotypical elements... the US version seems to focus almost solely on the sexual prowess of its characters, many of whom are ill defined and selfish.  Sure, they've tried to balance some of this out with the lesbian couple, but by and large, the first season is simply a way of introducing these illogical characters, none of whom seem very appealing on any level. I give it three stars because the acting is uniformly fine, and the music is terrific, but on the whole, ""Queer as Folk's"" US cousins fall flat week in and week out.  To be sure, there are gay men who spend their entire lives chasing sex, drugs and Donna Summer, but in this day and age, wouldn't it be nice to finally see some normal gay men and women who live full, ordinary lives like the rest of the world does?  As a series, this one does a great disservice to the community.",1017878400,8,1089,4.457286432160804

Whenever I watch them it's mostly sporadic and rarely do I ever ""buy"" the DVD to them...until Queer as Folk!  Simply put, this is the way a TV show needs to be!  It's got great characters, smart camera work, outstanding actors and actresses and a great soundtrack that I still listen to long after season one is over!
The DVD product is nothing short of brilliant!  With 6 discs, you are given a plethora of entertainment including interviews with the cast, special edition episodes (which aired last summer), a super clean widescreen version of the show which is the way the show is intended to be seen, deleted scenes including a hilarious scene that was unfortunately cut from it's original state involving Michael, a fella he met at Babylon and a snowy park-need I say more?  This a great DVD product!  Some have mentioned they have had problems with a few episodes pausing in the middle.  I will concur!  What customers need to do is reply to the phone number listed inside the package.  If you're disc defective, they will instruct you to send the disc in for a new one.  I did this and my new one works just fine.  They even paid for the shipping and handling!  So, there ya go!  As you can see from previous reviews, this is a great show!  With all the features and content, it's plenty of stuff to keep you busy on a rainy day!  Enjoy!",1017360000,5,1689,4.411003236245954
1656836,5,B00005RIY5,"Ok, I was hooked from the start, and I started out in the middle of the 2nd season, and I had to find out where it all started. The 1st season is slick, fun, sizzling with everything you would expect and hope for in a gay serial. HOWEVER, if you really follow this closely, you suddenly realize that you are in a time warp! You are living the wonderful sexy, druggy 70's in a 2001 setting. It it a wonderful release - it makes me want to go find Babylon and go out dancing and get ...
But seriously, when I think of straight people watching this or young gay men and lesbians, and am often horrified. It's about as true to life as a daytime soap opera. This is NOT what life is all about. I am entertained by this and I watch it every week, and I purchased the first season without hesistation, but hey - this is not reality. It's just entertainment.
In addition, I've read some of the reviews by people who are shocked by this series. I wonder if they are ""shocked"" by The Sopranos?",1017360000,,983,4.178947368421053
1656837,5,B00005RIY5,"I was hooked on this show after the first episode.  Witty dialog, engaging characters and storylines that touch the heart and open the mind.  Some have complained that the show stereotypes gays, but I disagree.  The wide variety of characters show many types of gay men: Brian(the self-absorbed slut), Ted: (Shy and insecure and works in the straight world), Michael: (the -guy-next-door), Emmett: (flashy, out and proud) and Justin: (a teen just coming out of the closet).  Underneath the outward apperances are characters with real emotions, flaws and heart.  Even Brian isn't as shallow as he wants everyone to believe.  In my opinion, there is a little bit of all these characters in most gay men or they represent qualities we wish we had.  Who wouldn't want to be as self-assured as Brian or as openly proud as Emmett?
Some have also complained that the show focuses on sex too much.  While there is a fair amount of action between the sheets on the show, anyone who thinks that that is all it's about clearly isn't watching carefully.  The show has dealt with life and death issues, gay parenting, coming out, self-esteem, friendship and being true to yourself.  Sex is just part of it.
After watching this show, I felt like finally there was a show out there for me and about me.  It features characters going through many of the same things I face...feeling insecure at a bar, worrying about losing my job if I come out and searching for that special man in a world that does occupy itself all too often with sex and the bar scene.  If the show focuses on sex and the bars, it is only a mirror of reality.  As a gay man who sometimes wishes the bars and sex wasn't such a big factor, this show was an accurate portrait of the frustration I sometimes feel.
So ignore the negative reviews(espicially the one titled ""Couldn't Be More Pathetic"" by Aron(bitter,party of one...do you think he could learn to spell???).  Buy a copy of this excellent series and you'll be singing ""Let's Hear For the Boy"" by the end of the first episode.",1016755200,10,2038,4.625

A friend showed me a few episodes 20-22 and after the first one I thought yeah right but then came the last episode and I thought YEAH RIGHT I was hooked and knew I had to get the DVD as soon as it came out.
Living in Pennsylvania I find these characters are dead on accurate.  What I enjoy most is the characters are there for each other in good times and bad.

1656841,5,B00005RIY5,"Let's face it - gays in television are stereotyped.  Jack, on Will & Grace, is what I'd imagine many people in straight America envision gay men to be - queeny, vapid, self-obsessed and sexually compulsive.. yet in a very G-rated way.
I originally bought the British version of QAF (series 1) and while I enjoyed it, it lacked a certain believability for me, possibly because of the various cultural differences and overall attitude towards homosexuality in Europe.
The American version, however, I held off on purchasing, mainly because I didn't want to be fed 22 hours of stereotypes of gay men and lesbians that had absolutely no reflection of my personal experience.
Indeed, the first couple of episodes turned me off - cliche, sex-obsessed, and bitter overtones were almost too much to get past, but fortunately, I did.
The remaining 19-20 episodes of season one, in many ways, hit very close to home.  Set in a real-ish city (P'burg), I felt immediately that the characters were in a ""real"" setting, unlike the world of Ross, Rachel and the gang in ""Friends"" - although the characters, at first blush, seemed to be slices of gay male stereotypes we've all seen before.  The beauty of this show is the extensive character development, and the patience required of the audience to let their individual characteristics sink in.
Justin's childish infatuation with Brian grew from highly annoying to palpable and real; the various love triangles (Michael and Brian, Ted and Michael, Brian and nobody) became plausible.  The issues in the relationships were real without being patronizing (commitment-phobia, drugs, unfaithfulness, etc) and developed WELL beyond the fleeting banality of the 30-minute relationships we're given via the girls on Sex in the City.
All in all, I was won over completely - and the finale of episode 22 even convinced me that Brian, the character I hated the most of all, was, deep down, likeable and even plausible.  The beauty of the range of characters here is that there's a part (or parts) of each of them that to some degree reflect the realities of what it's like to be a gay man in the new millenium.
This is indeed groundbreaking television, though not because of the rather graphic sexuality it depicts, but because, for the first time (in my opinion), gay life is examined for ALL things - not just the drama and the materialism, but for the difficulty of balancing the unique social constructs of life in a straight world with the sometimes life-altering (and even life-saving) friendships and relationships that make for a truly diverse community.  Cheers to the Americans for finally getting one right (and to Showtime for having the guts to make it happen)!",1016323200,45,2700,4.949227373068433

Are these gay people I know?  Are these gay people I could care about?  NO!""  Then along about epidode 10 (I guess) I was hooked.....BIG TIME.  I not only cared about these characters, I knew them.  These guys were old friends. I knew them, or their counter-parts in San Francisco.....I even saw myself!  I watched all episodes on DVD in 24 hours.  In a frenzy....all at once.  I had the flu at the time and sat in a fevered daze in rapture.....wishing it would never end.

1656864,4,B00005RIY5,"I really fell for the original British version of Queer as Folk when it was released on DVD.  When I heard that an American version was in the works, I was not optimistic.  Usually Americanized remakes of European movies are much inferior to the originals.  However, after watching the first couple dics of the first season of the American ""QaF,"" I was pleasantly suprised.  The casting is at least as good as the British series (although the brit cast was much more believeable as working class lads than the Yanks are as blue-collar Pittsburghers), and you quickly become attached to these characters--even with their many human flaws.  Much of the plot and dialogue is lifted directly from the original series--with minor Americanizing changes.  And for me, the weakness of the U.S. series shows most when they deviate from the original.  The ""new"" plot twists are often unbelievable and teter on the absurd--like one character uncharacteristically joining an ""aversion therapy"" group that is populated by poorly conceived stereotypes that cause the sequence to lose its impact. And writing for the new material just isn't as strong.  And then there is the ""artistic license""--can anyone REALLY believe that Pittsburgh has a gay ghetto that seems to rival West Hollywood, complete with hoards of drag queens marching down the streets and couples having anonymous sex around every corner?  At times, it feels like this series is from the pre-AIDS era and isn't really a reflection of contemporary gay life.  The fact that it is produced and written my middle-aged gays, like myself, probably explains the occasional anachronistic tone--but it's also probably why my partner and I relate to it.  Anyway... if you can overlook occasional lapses in believability, you should really enjoy this series.  I can't wait for season two to come out on DVD (even though I hear that it's weaker than season one).",1015804800,4,1902,5.060897435897436

Here in my country, Mexico, QAF is a big success, we can only see it on cable, but many people has it, so the show is starting to get attention of gay and straight people.

1656867,5,B00005RIY5,"QAF is an extremely well written series, presenting a cross section of urban American gay stereotypes.  The characters are well developed, with exceptional depth.  A leading character (who you are at first likely to despise) exhibits very subtle hints of a person with far more depth, early in the series.  Watch for it - it's there in what he *doesn't* say.  In a perfect world, this series would win top honors for cinematography:  bedroom scenes, in particular, are stunningly beautiful.  Nothing of the urban gay nightlife is left untouched, yet it is touched gracefully and with remarkable sensitivity.

QAF is one of those shows that helps you bond with friends.  I spend my Sunday nights glued with friends in front of the telly watching and then discussing the episodes.

The writers and producers of the show have done a great job in creating characters with depth that the viewer, whether gay or straight, can identify with on some level. It's a great show about PEOPLE who just happen to be gay or lesbian.  They have families, jobs, homes, responsibilites, problems, loves, flaws and feelings just like everyone else.

I watched the British version first and absolutely loved it but was sad that it ended so quickly.  Now I have the first season of the American series, which took the scripts of the British series and adapted them to fit a series that is a long time continuing drama.  (For those of you who love the American version and have not seen the British version I highly, highly recommend buying and watching it.)
It was really interesting to see all the changes they made to the British scripts in the American version.  Like the Phil/Ted character who dies in the British version survives the drug overdose in the American version.  I really liked that change.  In fact I have to say that I liked almost all of the changes that the American version made.  Like the fact that the Stuart/Brian character has a more long-term relationship with the Nathan/Justin character.  In my opinion Brian's on going relationship with Justin makes him much more likable than his British counterpart Stuart.  I also like the fact that the Vince/Michael character's relationship with Cameron/David character lasts much much longer in the American version and also has Michael actually moving in with David.  When I really think about it I have to say I like the American version better mainly because it doesn't end.

1656905,5,B00005RIY5,"I watched this Showtime series with my roommates and we were not sure what to expect.  This American counterpart to the British smash hit is good and eventually hooks you in with each character. Though it can be sometimes a bit too soap opera-ish, it is a relevant show for the gay and straight community as well.  Debbie (Sharon Gless) is my favorite character as the PFlag mom with a heart of gold.  I wasn't sure if I would like Emmett, the flaming undaunted queen--afraid he would be too stereotypical---but he is kind and funny.  Michael, I think, can be too gulliable and I'd like to see him get over Brian and move on in his life.  Having Brian as a best friend and doting on him like a helpless puppy are too different things. The rest of the cast is good as well....even Brian, who as cold as he can be, will occassionally show glimpses of humanity that hides deep within that iceberg of a heart.  I hope in Season Two, we see more of Melanie and Lindsey and see more character development of them to boot.  The dvd features lots of special features, including deleted scenes and special episodes involving cast interviews.  If you liked the series, you'll want this box set.  I recommend it highly.",1013817600,4,1208,4.504587155963303
1656906,5,B00005RIY5,"Though I'm older than most of the people who make up the ensemble cast of this series, it still resonates with me more than anything I've ever seen, on TV or film.  The most important thing that QAF does, for me anyway, is to present a segment of contemporary gay life in a context that is non-judgmental, non-apologetic, and that transcends simple stereotypes.  By the time you've watched the second or third episode, the sexual orientation of the characters is not the primary thing you're thinking about.  And unlike ""Will and Grace"" (a good enough show as far as network TV goes), the gayness of the characters is not what drives every single storyline.
Yes, there's a lot of graphic sexual activity, but that is not the only thing that this series is all about.  Instead, it's about the intertwined lives of a group of people who happen to be gay, but whose basic wants and needs are the same as anyone else's.  It's true that they sometimes seek to meet these needs in ways that appear to be self-defeating (excessive use of drugs, sexual encounters with no emotional connection, etc.), but that happens with straight people, too. It's also true that they spend a lot of time talking about their relationships, which of course includes a lot of talk about sex, but again, is that a uniquely gay phenomenon?
The over-riding theme that the viewer gets is that these people have created a unique (if somewhat dysfunctional) family for themselves.  This is a theme that is familiar to most gay men and women from their own lives, and one that has been written about and portrayed in movies going back to the 1970s classic ""Boys in the Band"". What's so powerfully different about QAF is that it does this without all of the self-hatred that characterized older portrayals of gay life.  Whatever problems these people may have, they are more at peace with their gayness than preceding generations.  You can see it even within the group itself.  Seventeen-year-old Justin outs himself to his parents in terms that are as explicit and honest as anything you've heard, far more so than his friends in their late 20's would have done.
This is not to say that these people don't experience blatant homophobia as well as more subtle forms of discrimination, because the show tackles these issue head-on, and in most cases, the characters confront these problems with strength and pride.
But QAF is not just a political statement about gay pride, it's great entertainment.  The acting is consistently solid, rising to heights not often seen on network TV.  With a series of subplots and relationships that develop and shift over time, the viewer comes to know the characters and in most cases, to honestly care about them.  At first glance, they may appear to be one-dimensional and often shallow.  But each of them is far more complex than they seem.
There have been complaints that there's not enough air-time given to Melanie and Lindsay, the lesbian couple, but they are essential characters who are involved in all of the main plot lines.
The show is characterized by excellent production with innovative camera work (the way the camera ""ramps"" in for some of the close-ups is used to great effect), though there are a fair number of scenes that would benefit from better lighting.
The DVD set is nicely packaged with good labeling of each disc's contents.  The widescreen format looks great on my 27"" TV in letterbox format.  The extra material is good and navigation is fairly intuitive.  So far I've only encountered two minor flaws on disc 3; it played fine and did not lock up or skip, but there were two brief moments where the picture broke up.",1013212800,5,3649,4.768253968253968

The Queer As Folk DVD Box Set has all 22 episodes of the first season of the most controversial and bravest series in the history of television. The total running time of all 6 DVD's is approx: 1,205 minutes which includes Bonus features such as: behind the scenes outtakes, deleted scenes, special edition episodes, a Photo Gallery, DVD rom extras, A 6 minute Season 2 Sneek Peek, and much more. Queer As Folk shows the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Now I had been hearing so much about this amazing Showtime series for sometime, yet I had never seen a single episode as I did not have Showtime, but then in July of 2001 I heard this show was coming to DVD in its entire first season and I knew I was in for a real treat. I waited up until the very day of Queer As Folks release date on January 8, 2002 and I purchased this DVD collection not knowing what to expect. I knew it was a gamble to buy an expensive DVD collection of something I had never seen before, but I went with my heart and I bought it. I can honestly say this was truly one of the BEST DVD investments I have ever made. When I got home I knew it was gonna be a while before i watched all 22 episodes and as i got through the first 2 pilot episodes I was hooked and so excited to see the next episode, just as I am when I watch The Young And The Restless. It took me 3 days to watch all of the episodes and I am amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic fornification scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the gaul to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. I have since signed up for Showtime just for this show. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think.

That's the first line of dialogue, spoken in voiceover at the beginning of ""Queer as Folk"", a sprawling, impressively realized drama about the lives of several working-class gay men living in Pittsburgh at the turn of the 21st century. And, indeed, this 22-episode series - based on the British original which ran for eight episodes in 1999 before spawning a brief sequel the following year - presents a visual celebration of gay sex in all its forms, launching headfirst into NC-17 territory with unapologetic abandon. Some parts are raunchy and liberating, while others are soulless and ugly, yet the script never preaches or condemns, merely observes without judgment.

Using the narrative template established by writer Russell T. Davies in the UK version, many of QAF's initial episodes will be familiar to anyone who's already seen the original - same characters and situations, same dramatic arc - but it eventually finds its own feet, employing a defiantly American approach in terms of mood and execution, whilst remaining true to the spirit of Davies' initial concept. As might be expected, the show touches on a variety of pressing social issues including HIV and AIDS, homophobia and ex-gay ministries, whilst also confronting some ugly home truths, most notably the casual (and not-so-casual) drug use which enhances some people's lives whilst ruining others. This is ambitious, warts-and-all stuff, portrayed with integrity and passion.

Much of the show's success is due principally to the casting of Gale Harold, making a staggeringly assured screen debut as ultra-sexy Brian Kinney, an elemental force of nature whose actions and reactions inform the lives of virtually every other character in the show. A sexual predator by nature, his cold-hearted vanity and selfish bravado may seem a little obnoxious at first, but this incredibly complex character - terrified of growing older and turning into his overbearing father - is eventually exposed as a decent, loving man whose withering cynicism (""There's only two kinds of straight people in this world - the ones that hate you to your face, and the ones that hate you behind your back"") masks a soul in crisis. How appropriate that the first season should end on a closeup of his beautiful face, the mask completely (albeit forcibly) removed.

Other stand-outs in an exceptional cast include comedian Hal Sparks as Brian's lovable best friend Michael, the indomitable Sharon (""I love my gay son!"") Gless as Sparks' over-the-top mom Debbie, and Michelle Clunie as Melanie, a no-nonsense lawyer whose hostility towards Brian allows plenty of room for dramatic conflict (Clunie and Thea Gill play a loving couple whose lives are central to the proceedings, unlike the British original where the female characters seemed almost surplus to requirements). Scott Lowell (Ted) and Peter Paige (Emmett) complete the core group, which is bolstered by the arrival of 17 year old Justin (played by the astonishingly young-looking 23 year old, Randy Harrison), coming out of the closet with a vengeance while his worried mom (Sherry Miller) hovers on the sidelines, maintaining an anxious vigil. Along with Gale Harold, Harrison is involved in some of the show's most graphic sex scenes, and both actors display a level of bravery and commitment that goes way beyond the call of duty. Hats off to both of them.

Look out for a wealth of memorable scenes and set-pieces, such as the hilarious whirlwind romance between Emmett and his 'soulmate' which crams a lifetime of gay cliches into a two-hour relationship (!); Brian coming out to his father (a powerful cameo by experienced character actor Lawrence Dane); Melanie's reaction to a bigoted nurse during a moment of crisis; Debbie's jaw-dropping description of Brie cheese (!); and Justin becoming, shall we say, REALLY acquainted with handsome young football jock Chris Hobbs (a small but hugely significant role, played by Alec McClure) in the school's athletic room... All gay life is here, as the old saying goes.

To the accompaniment of a thumping musical soundtrack, the season culminates in a deeply moving season finale (directed by Alex Chapple), which contains the show's most outstanding scene of all, a glorious, life-affirming sequence in which most of Justin's hopes and dreams are realized at the school prom, set to the haunting, melancholy strains of Ben E. King's classic, 'Save the Last Dance for Me'. Which, of course, leaves us totally unprepared for the devastation that follows...

Afterwards, during the show's closing moments, the audience is abruptly reminded of the fragile humanity which underpins these extraordinary characters, and how much they've captured our hearts. In the end, as raunchy as it is, the show isn't really about sex at all - it's about PEOPLE, and the way our lives are defined by our relationships with family and loved ones. This episode, more than any other, amounts to a near-perfect combination of music, character development and dramatic action, and is without question the most heartbreaking hour of television this reviewer has ever seen.

Though prompted by its excellent British counterpart, the US version of QAF is arguably one of the most significant events in the history of gay film and television in America because, crucially, it's financed and exhibited from within the mainstream arena. It isn't low-budget and marginalized - it's empowering, intelligent and uproariously funny, and it's in-your-face like nothing you've ever seen on TV before. After this, the representation of gay people in American art can never be the same again, because QAF has set the standard against which all future offerings must surely be measured. Absolutely magnificent.",1012348800,163,5874,5.211864406779661
1656933,5,B00005RIY5,"First of all, I am a big fan of Queer as Folk.  I watched the British series and the US version.  I prefer the American version because it is racier and the cast is better.
I must say that this series is unique. Not only because of the gay life it portrays and its nudity.  Simply because of its treatment, its visual quality and its story line. This is quality TV production rarely equalled.  On my list, it comes ex aequo with my all-time favorite TV series: Shogun.  QAF is not only about sex, nudity and the gay club scene. It is also about real characters that we care for and who uncover multi-layered aspects of themselves throughout the series. It is quality TV for every adult viewer, gay or straight, and everyone can learn from QAF about relationships between friends, lovers, parents and children. It is also about acceptance, tolerance and respect of each other's lifestyle, from all points of view (parents, school mates, etc.).

I had to buy the DVDs because it promised so many extras.  I watched all 6 discs and I must admit that it left me almost breathless.
Every episode (22 in all) is so well directed. Visually, it is simple pleasure to watch the story unfold with all the characters. The cast works better in the US version than in the British one. They seem to be working better together as an ensemble cast.
For every episode, you have chapter selections, the ""next on"" feature (a preview of the next episode), audio set-up, a synopsis of the episode itself. Very well made. And they kept the ending credits for each episode!
There are 3 special edition episodes. These are episodes with commentaries but it is uniquely done. While you have the episode itself on the right half of the screen, you have a filmed commentary on the left half of the screen, so you actually see the commentator (director, actor, etc.). This is amazingly well done.
The other extras are really good, from the outtakes to a sneak preview of Season 2.
It even looks better on DVD than when it originally aired on TV.
All DVD collections of TV series should be done that way. This is really what we may call a collector's edition.
Can't wait for Season 2 on DVD.  I just hope they will do something of that quality for Oz when it comes out on DVD. It deserves the same treatment. ""Shogun"" as well!

But after I watch this DVD, I come to think I'm very glad I am a gay man! the name of ""Queer as folk"" may be derived from a saying of Yorkshire, "" There's nowt so queer as folk,"" and this TV show really tells me that human, especially gay people, are inestimable.

You don't have to be gay to enjoy this amazing kleidoscope of characters.  Brian is the man that you find in every gay community: successful, wealthy, and charasmatically irresistable.

If you have read the original script by Russel T Davis, the US producers have done is add in those elements that are missing, which explains the story a little more indepth.

This US version is just as good as its British predecessor. In fact, it is better because it takes the original story and ads much more texture to it....including changes that just enhance the story altogether. The actors and their characters are excellent.  My only disappointment with it is that two of the six DVD disks were defective.  They skip in places on the 2nd disk and the 6th disk was completely unwatchable.

It actually has good actors and great storylines. Hal Sparks who plays Michael has got to be the most likable character ever to be filmed. You'll wish you actually be his friend. All of the other actors are great too. There are some things I don't like about this show though. One being the opening. It displays a disgusting show of beefy men in tiny shorts and they are dancing around to horrible music with terrible music playing. They're awful dancers too. All the flashing colors probably make many unsuspecting people go into seizures. I also don't like the drug use in this show. Even Michael uses. And their theory on this is that it's ok to use as long as you don't get addicted. I don't like that. I love the rest of the show though.,1011484800,,892,4.284023668639053

1656992,5,B00005RIY5,"Queer As Folk - The Complete First Season - Collector's Edition DVD Boxed Set.
A Showtime Original Series.
This is an excellent original series featured on an outstanding DVD collection.
I'll give you my condensed version: I enjoyed it a great deal. The acting is good, the stories are engaging and the characters seem real. I'm recommending it without reservation.
First, the packaging of this set is top of the line. The six-disc collection is a double-sided fold-in design.  Each disc is colored with one of the rainbow pride colors-a very nice, and unexpected, touch. Also featured with this box set-a nice little rainbow pride disc place marker-it's a six-colored rainbow ribbon.
Before I get into my opinions, let me say that the discs themselves, quality wise, are outstanding. I watched every last minute of the six disc set, including the special episode editions and bonus material and had flawless picture and sound throughout.
Yes, I did enjoy the series.
I had never seen a single scene of Queer As Folk (QAF) before I got this DVD. That's not to say I hadn't heard about it, because I had. I've read a great deal about it: the sex, the drugs, the language, the lesbian bashing, etc.
What I found, upon watching it myself, was that I liked the stories and I liked the characters.
It's always difficult to forget what you've read when approaching a television series like this but I did my best to just approach it with my own personal life experiences as a guide.
To address the mini-points mentioned above:
There's sex and a whole lot of it. Much of it anonymous and much of it graphic. All of it gay/lesbian. Was I offended? No, not at all. As a matter of fact, the shear volume of sex actually makes it less shocking. The sex depicted in the series is not there to titillate (though it probably does); it's there simply as part of a story, part of the lives of these characters. Having watched the discs in long multi-hour blocks, it actually became a little numbing, though not to say uninteresting.
There's drugs and a lot of them. They're taken frequently and unapologetically. Again, they're presented as part of the story. Was I offended? Not at all.  They're not preachy about what they're presenting and not every character takes illicit drugs.
""the language""-Actually this is where I get a little prudish (surprised it's with the language and not the sex?) because the mouths on these folks are trashy. I thought all the foul language was a little over the top.
""the lesbian-bashing""-A little explanation here. Quite a bit of press has been dedicated to the idea that the lesbian couple in the series is verbally derided and ""bashed"" by the gay male characters. I was a little worried about this, being a lesbian myself. I was a little weary of it because after one episode, I was really enjoying the series and didn't want to get offended as things went on. I found though, that I was more than 10 hours into the series when I realized that I hadn't been offended yet, not in the least. There's some name-calling, some use of words I'm not particularly thrilled with, but much of the name calling, was done in jest. I didn't find it offensive or at all ""mean spirited"" and I was looking for it. The one time a particularly graphic word is used in a negative and angry way, it is used by one of the lesbian characters.
The writer's have done a wonderful job with giving these characters expansive and full lives. These episodes deal with issues and problems:age of consent (by ignoring it), drug use (by using them), safe sex (by having it), lesbian moms (by portraying it), conversion groups (by lampooning them), school outings (by portraying them realistically), hate (by living through it), family dedication and confusion (by showing the impact of being yourself), excessive drug use (by showing the consequences).
I defy you to name another series which tackles these issues. It does not feel forced; these are issues that these characters deal with.
One complaint I've heard is that the ""girls"" have so little screen time. I'll remind everyone that there is a five man to two woman ratio so it's reasonable that the guys will be on screen more often. I'm just thrilled to have a lesbian couple featured at all. The fact that we get so much from them, with so little screen time, is a great indication of the fine writing and acting that we see here. For those wondering-we do get one sex scene between Melanie and Lindsay-its in episode 9.
Quick comment on the season finale- This is the most amazing episode. It is incredibly moving and romantic and terrifying. I don't want to give away too much, but it was well written and well acted. You will be moved.
On the believability scale-I'd give this series an ""A.
The discs-some information on the discs themselves and they way they are set up.
Each disc contains 3 or 4 episodes. On each disc are six chapters you can use for scene access. Featured are each episodes ""next on"" promo-a feature which I liked a lot and which I was surprised to find. Each episode also contains a small summary of what the episode is about.
On disc1, disc 3 and disc 5 are ""special edition episodes"" which repeat a specific episode with commentary by the cast and producers. These are fun to watch and it's always great to hear the actor talk about the character they are portraying. These cannot, though, be watched INSTEAD of the episodes. They are strictly extra viewing. Episode 1, episode 11 and episode 18 are given this special treatment.
Disc 6 contains the last three episodes (20-22) and a great collection of bonus features listed in the Amazon page.",1011052800,170,5622,4.683518705763397
1656993,5,B00005RIY5,"When it comes to their slogan, cable television's Showtime network definitely has ""no limits."" ""Queer as Folk"" (or ""QAF"" for short) was introduced into the network's lineup in January 2001. Following their first community-oriented series, ""Soul Food"" (aimed for African-Americans) and ""Resurrection Boulevard"" (Latinos), QAF was the first gay serial to debut on American television.
Based on the popular, yet controversial British series of the same name, QAF is a pioneering achievement for network programming. Before the rise of the gay rights movement in the 1990s, a gay-themed series would been unheard of in the United States. Unlike their European and Australian/New Zealander counterparts, American audiences tended to remain very closed to depictions of gay subculture for decades. However, with the emergence of gay culture and its' promotion in the media (e.g., Madonna, Margaret Cho, etc.) QAF debuted at a time that tolerance was becoming part of mainstream culture.
The show, which takes place in Pittsburgh (but actually filmed in Toronto, Canada) QAF revolves around four gay friends. Michael (Hal Sparks) is a manager at a local department store; Brian (played excellently by newcomer Gale Harold) is a heartless, nymphomaniac, yet very misunderstood advertisement executive; Ted (played by the adorable Scott Lowell) is a businessman who is the hopeless romantic; and finally Emmett (Peter Paige) a flamboyant retail worker with some of the funniest lines ever heard.
After a series of events at the local gay club, Babylon, Justin (Randy Harrison) a 17 year old student who is starting to debut in Pittsburgh's gay scene, becomes the fifth member of the quartet, pouring his affection and devotion to an unwanting, selfish Brian. Ted, who secretly is in love with Michael faces a near death experience after an accidental overdose. Emmett provides both hysterical and inspirational output in balancing the events in his friend's lives, and Michael deals with homophobia at work and meeting a new love.
Rounding out the cast are a handful of women who provide their support to their male counterparts. Sharon Gless, or television's ""Cagney and Lacey"" plays Debbie Novotny, Michael's mother with humor and grace. The show's lesbian couple (Melanie Clunie and Thea Gill) face trials and tribulations in raising a newborn son and the distance caused by Brian's (the baby's biological father) interference in raising their son. Others such as Makyla Smith (Daphne) and Jack Wetherall (Uncle Vic) add plenty of charm to a storyline that many might find hard to accept, especially when it deals with the show's soft-core depictions of gay sex.
Regardless of your tolerance level, QAF is as enjoyable and enthralling as many of today's cable series. Similar to a gay version of ""Sex and the City,"" QAF has plenty of quality material not to only open eyes, but to stir mouths. For conservatives out there, I recommend them watching QAF as folk to have a comprehension of what gay culture and drug use are really like in today's America. For parents dealing with the coming out of their children, I recommend it due to storyline revolving around Justin's coming out to his parents (Sherry Miller does an excellent job of playing Justin's understanding mother) and their reaction to accepting it. Maybe by doing so, they will have a better view on the subject before casting judgment on those who are involved in it. Once again, this show is not recommended for those who cannot stomach graphic depictions of gay sex and full frontal nudity.",1010966400,9,3550,5.186411149825784
1656994,5,B00005RIY5,"Queer As Folk is one of the most entertaining shows on TV. I have read many great positive reviews and yet some bad reviews. One thing I continue to notice about the bad reviews is that they are coming from people who know nothing about the gay lifestyle, and are focusing more on the sex scenes of Queer As Folk more than the plot of each show. The sex scenes are just a small part of this groundbreaking tv show, and many people have judged Queer As Folk on one show they saw out of the 22 first season episodes. I think this is a great Box set and encouarge any one who has an open mind to buy this. So far Official sales in the U.S. show that this DVD box set is expected to be the biggest selling gay DVD ever and one of the first truly gay TV shows to break in to the Top Ten DVD/VHS Sales Charts.

1656995,5,B00005RIY5,"Being a straight woman I never would have seen the things the way I do now without this series. I have never been homophobic and have never looked at one of my many friends and a few family members differently because they were gay. Much to my surprise there were still hang up's that I had prior to this show that I didn't know I had.
The first episode of season one I stumbled across while channel surfing, and I have to say I was shocked.  I just happened to tune in at the beginning of the first sex scene with Brian & Justin and it was very graphic. Immediately they worked in a safe sex message that was very cool since it involved a teenager. I tuned in every episode from that point on and I am now totally hooked. They tackle a lot of issues that are perceived to be unique to gay people but, in watching, they pertain to us all.
Yes, this series is a little campy and defiantly not for you if you are offended by sex scenes, foul language, and a lifestyle that is not your own.  One thing I have to say is that by the end of the first season I realized I was looking at the characters, who by the way are all straight but two, for the character they were playing and it was all very touching and normal with real love, emotion, and great acting. At the season closer I was in tears for the last 15 minutes, it was very touching and tragic. You do have to see the whole series and follow he characters to get the emotion out of it
I watch Sex and the City, and Queer as Folk is similar to the point where there is parallel's in the characters. (Remember, Sex and the City has won awards.) I think this series is a must see!",1010966400,4,1632,4.065217391304348

The characters are better developed, they're better looking, the scenes are much more explicit, it's just better all the way around. The stories are almost identical, but you'll like this one. We need to appreciate Showtime's commitment to bring entertaining shows like this to TV and the DVD market in spite of the prejudices and fears of many people.
I can't remember ever being impacted by a show or movie as I have been by this one.  ""I laughted, I cried, I kissed 90 bucks good-bye.""  And I don't regret one single penny of that money - it's the best investment I've ever made.  I started watching it on Thursday evening, and had to finish the entire 22 episodes by Sunday - I couldn't think of anything else.  And it did have me laughing (at Emmett and his ""dream lover"") and crying at the ups and downs of Michael's and David's relationship.

All the others are the same as if you recorded them off of your own TV.

1657012,5,B00005RIY5,"for those of you who don't have showtime, i highly recommend this dvd/vhs. the show is enthralling and addictive. it's characters are intense and sexy...extremely believable with highly potent situations. this is no ordinary glazed donut...it's hard core... in your face.. real life situations with some humor,very sexual content and drama.
for gay, straight or even female audiences...this is pure entertainment!",1009929600,7,413,5.786885245901639
1657013,5,B00005RIY5,"This show is better than soap operas. That's...it's more real. The issues are real. But the humor is a catcher too. I can't stomach Sex in the City...I can't stand the complaining, the story doesn't feel real. Queer as Folk though is heart-touching, almost true to life for today but not for the uneasy with it's ""no holds bar"" scenes. But the story line is awesome. I sit on the edge of my seat hoping Brian will finally be nice to Justin on a regualr basis. Hoping Michael will stay secure with himself and stick with David for the long haul.  I just love it. A lot of people will be able to relate to issues that the series touches on. I've been hoping that Queer as Folk would come out on DVD and wishes do come true. I'd rather have this than Sopranos and I love Sopranos too.",1009670400,10,781,4.241610738255034
1657014,5,B00005RIY5,"This show I must admit at first horrified me! But as I continued to watch the following episodes I have to say the characters bring you in. I am a straight female and I was not quit sure what the heck to expect having many gay friends I've never looked at the sexual aspect of their life styles. The story lines are just fabulous and Sharon Gless is the best as Michael's mother. It's what we need today to have the love and understanding of what gays and lesbians go through as far as discrimination. The episode where Uncle Vic is picked up on some trumped up charges really makes you stop and realize that things are not fair and unjust. I love the characters, the story line and the writing is superb. This is a cutting edge production and should be recognized along with other well written shows. Two thumbs up!!!!",1009584000,6,819,4.394736842105263
1657015,5,B00005RIY5,"I guess I have spent a good chunk of my life trying to find something that really represented the world I know and the feelings I feel.  I know.  I know.  There are the arguments of choice over birth in being gay, but I subscribe to the birth idea.  I simply knew I liked boys by the time I was 5... long before I even knew about sex.  With that said, I always felt that I was excluded by the entertainment industry.  We always had weekly TV series that featured boy-girl relationships and mom-dad families.  I was pretty hard pressed to use my imagination to find something I could see a little of myself or even my family in.  Nevertheless, I persevered and somehow managed to do so time and again.
Zip to the year 2000!  Suddenly, along came last year's breakthrough hit, Showtime's ""Queer As Folk"".  While the British version was quite a brilliant stroke of genius, the American version brought the story a little closer to home for me.  Due to the number of episodes made, the directors were able to develop characters and relationships a little more over the course of the first season.  We were able to witness the complexities of the Brian/Michael/David relationship as well as the difficulties of a young man named Justin as he ""came out of the closet"".
At times I winced as I thought, ""Jeez- people are going to see this and think all of this debauchery and superficiality is what gay men are all about!""  True, it's not THE definitive view into gay life, but I can assure you that I am quite capable of matching these characters to the real life counterparts in my life.  My mom, while not THE most comfortable with my pre-determined preference for men, watches this show every week and really gets excited about talking about the plot lines.  It is, in short, entertainment.  Plain and simple.  Just be open to the story and you just might forget it's two men or two women jumping in the sack.
After years of ""Dallas"", ""Dynasty"", ""Knots Landing"" and ""Melrose Place"", ""we"" finally get something we can latch on to and enjoy.  It also gives the world the opportunity to see that we are really not unlike the heterosexual community.  Again, I can't say that I have walked a similar path to ALL the characters on this series, though I know quite a few who have.  It's bright.  It's fresh.  It's full of living... and THAT is life.
I have yet to receive my DVD set, but knowing what the widescreen presentation of the show looks like- this is going to be on fantastic set!  Also included are outtake reels, deleted scenes and the ""Commentary Episodes"" that aired at the end of the first run of season one.
Even if you don't purchase this DVD set, at least watch the show and take a look for yourself.  Even though a majority of the characters are gay... you might still see a bit of yourself in one of them.  Who knows- you may get as hooked as my mom has!
I, for one, can't wait to get my hands on this set.  It's on order and I'm waiting for my late Christmas to show up at my doorstep!",1009324800,10,2995,4.409836065573771
1657016,5,B00005RIY5,"This show is by far the most entertaining, sexy, and addicting program ever. It shows just about every aspect of gay life. Not to mention the hot stars.

1657039,5,B00005RIY5,"This is really a dream come true. I was sincerely hoping that the makers would put this series out on video/DVD but I was a bit skeptical since it contained 22 episodes.  But now that they are going to I am so happy!
  Queer as Folk is based on the so called ""hit"" British TV show which I loathed and then some when I first saw it last year.  I found it pretentious, over the top and sensational.  None of the characters were likable and more to the point it did nothing but re-enforce the negative stereotype I had about gay men; mostly that they were irresponsible and mysoginistics.
 In fact the only positive thing that came out of that series was this one!  In fact I've learned more positive things about gays from this show than I have from all the gay activists and mainstream gay tv shows combined.  That is because in QAFUSA there is no name calling, and no preaching about how much gays need to be loved.  What we instead get is the portrayal of seven gay people who are shown with their flaws and virtues.  But unlike other soap operas at least these virtues and flaws are not superficial or over the top (ie. Drugs and alcohol).
The show involves a series of five gay men and two lesbians women living in Pittsburgh (but filmed in Toronto).  And covers their everyday lives. And when I say everyday lives I mean everyday lives. QAF manages to achieve what previous nighttime soaps could only dream of.  Instead of simply focusing on bed hopping and greed for money.  The show actually looks in depth at the characters including personal hang-ups, and personal maturity.  This show is hailed as a gay soap opera, but it is different from other gay shows I have seen.  There is no self-hatred at least based on being gay.  For example the character Brian is cold and arrogant and deep down unhappy, most other directors would have attributed this to ""the big bad homophobic world"".  Not so with QAFUSA they have decided to be a bit more universal story.  The reason for Brian's attitude is due to the rejection he received growing up from his alcoholic father (who by the way did not know he was gay until later).  Which also explains his promiscuity.  I don't think that Brian is lubricious persay.  Its' obvious that he loves (or cares) for Justin, it's  just that he's terrified of being rejected. Sexual conquests are far easier than allowing himself to fall in love.
 Michael is out to his gay friends and family but is not out to the rest of the world and in fact seems to feel slightly uncomfortable being so. I think that this has less to do with being ashamed of his being gay.  Than it does of him not wanting to be seen as outside the norm. A feeling a think that many gays and lesbians feel
I also like admire the show for it responsibility.  Another original tack was in the ex-gay arc, whereas most other creators would have used this as an occasion to attack Christians and Christian teachings, The creators responsibly shy away from naming any religion at all, and just stick to the story that God loves everyone.
One of the reasons I love this show is that I can actually relate to the characters. The show covers relation issues, employment issues, extended family issues and basically the value we place on ourselves as people.  This is a show for people of all backgrounds. Both homosexual and heterosexual.  But most of all I think it primarily is aimed at us generation X-sers those of us who were born in the late 60's and early 70's who live over here in North America.  Since for a lot of North Americans 20 somethings there seems to a delayed adolescence. A lot of the show (without being preachy) tackles the symbolism of growing up (i.e. Entering your 30's) and the personal change that goes with it in that it is time to grow up and face responsibilities as an adult.
The actors, while not the Royal Shakespear company, do a passable job and convey what they were hired to do. The male and female characters play very well to each other. I even found that I have a big crush on Brian (Gale Harold) even though he's arrogant and cold--not my usual choice!.  I would not be honest if I did not admit that I do partly like this show for sexist reasons.  Had it been a heterosexual soap opera where Brian was cold and brutal to women, or where Ted turned down women his age for being too ""old"". I may not have enjoyed it that much.  One minor quibble  I find the sex scenes overdrawn and a bit too gratutous. Buy it's nothing that can't be forwarded fasted through.
As far as I'm concerned Queer as Folk- USA beats  ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex in the City"" hands down and it certainly eclipses the British version by a mile.  Take it from one of the last people on earth who should be enjoying this kind of thing.  This is one series you will want to add to your collection and watch over and over again!",1007942400,9,4836,4.425988700564972
1657040,2,B00005RIY5,"While Queer As Folk is fascinating in that it has pushed the depiction of gay life light years beyond any other TV show or movie, especially in its portrayal of gay love; Queer As Folk manages to play it exceedingly safe in showing diversity.  There are no major ethnic characters on the show.  The majority of the QAF mainstays are young, very attractive and somewhat affluent.  They live in a fantasy gay world where only the beautiful young men come to dance in a disco with a backroom (and this in Pittsburgh of all places!) You will never find transgendered characters, bears, people with disabilities or the gay everyman on this show.  AIDS is acknowledged in Michael's Uncle who is mostly a sad, old queen who makes intimations about his mortality.  If anything, QAF preserves the gay stereotypes it professes it wants to tear down by portraying gay men as frivolous pretty boys lacking in depth or substance.  Each character borders on caricature; from jaded sex addict, naive boy toy, fashion queen, materialistic lipstick lesbians, frustrated button downed frumpy queer with a addiction to web porn, etc.
QAF could do so much more but doesn't try.  It relies on sex,nudity and flash to titillate and capture your attention.  Sadly, it has very little to say, save its attention to gay youth and the coming out experience.  Even then, it is handled ""fabulously"" by making the gay teen in question a student at a private school from a noveau riche suburb, who just happens to fall in with a supportive group of adult friends.
I am longing for a real life drama based on real queer people and their lives not this fab Hollywood glossy dream.",1007769600,25,1648,4.754385964912281

This show is so good ...I saw another review from some writer in LA complaining about this show. My son and all of his straight and gay friends watch this show. It's so good I hope they run it forever. The writing is so good it's better than some of the so called best shows on regular tv. Thank God Showtime had the guts to put this show on the air. I've told a lot of my friends to watch just for the characterizations alone. I can't wait for the 2nd season to start. I'll be making a lot of long distance calls again to my son as we talk about this show.,1005782400,10,710,3.8299319727891157

Besides being completely fascinated by the whole gay cinema genre, I love this show because it is well-written, the characters are great and the stories are interesting and entertaining.  It makes absoutely no excuses for the way the characters live, for the nature of the show and for the themes.  Also, from a purely filmmaking point of view, the camera angles and photographic choices made in this show are fascinating.  The rather graphic parts of this show do take some getting used to, but if you have an open mind and give it a chance, you will become hooked!  I think it's fabulous that our television is taking these sort of risks... Check this show out, you will be shocked and first and then surprised by how entertained you can be...",1005782400,18,854,4.622516556291391

This show is smart and for showtime to finally have the courage to air a show about homosexual life style is a big stap and I thank showtime for being brave. 5 Stars
