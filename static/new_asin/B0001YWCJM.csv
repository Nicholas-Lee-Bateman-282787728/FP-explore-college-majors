8296556,5,B0001YWCJM,"Absolutelu great, fantastic ,this is a must for Junies Junkies and especially Margo-Maniacs. What a fascinating woman. Totally soft spoken amd humble when talking smetimes a little giddy. Sings with the strength of a lion . Seems to be someone so self cofident and inwardly strong she can save it all for the music and be totally sweet while speaking. Her voice quality and reproduction is like nowhere else.. on this tape no words to describe where it can take you There is a second female singer named Karin Bergquist absolutely bautiful who does a splendid backup. Musically this concert is exquisite devoid of the drawn out electronic jams the Junkies sometimes get carried away with. Power packed versions Come Calling, First Reccollections and Small Swift Birds among others. I have played each of these 4or 5 times in a row Unfortunately the recording emgneers seemed to be getting their  bearings in the first song Good Friday-one my all time favorites: the sound goes hollow for part of it. After that the sound quality is great through out. Margo's  voice benefis massive from the natuarlness and fullness of the analog format a issue discussed in my listmanias. Get this you'll be glad you did  Don't worry about the great VHS drawback of no track selection-you won't want to skip too many songs",1210636800,,1306,4.873873873873874
