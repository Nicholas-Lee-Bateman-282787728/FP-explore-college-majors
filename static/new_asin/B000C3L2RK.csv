Maria Felix is so good in this movie you just feel her character.........Not only that but if you like good taste in clothing, this movie is for you. They had original fashions from Balenciaga, and Patou made exclusively just for her....She just has  great style a true Icon...........",1270512000,4,357,4.578125
