1663213,5,B00005TNG6,"I was two years old when Roberta Flack's first album, First Take, was released in 1969. However, in 1987,at the age of 19, I heard her 1971 album,Quiet Fire, and my life changed forever.  I love the vocal talents of Nina Simone, Billie Holdiay, Sarah Vaughan, Ella F, Aretha, etc.  Roberta Flack, however, has a way to getting to the soul of man with her lovely storytelling approach. Her music is HONEST! This DVD is the best that I've ever seen her.  Her voice is as smooth and lovely as when I first heard her.  Her delivery and timing is impeccable.
Thank you, Ms. Roberta Flack, for giving the WORLD romance, mystery, and love.  This DVD proves that she is still the queen of her craft!!!",1017273600,7,693,4.468253968253968

7954082,3,B00005TNG6,I have really been a fan for years of Roberta Flack and seen her live performance twice.  The dvd performance is not as good as what I saw live but was only one available.  too bad the work with donny hathaway and later peabo bryson is on dvd,1247529600,,242,4.020833333333333
7954083,4,B00005TNG6,"Roberta Flack takes us under her spell for an evening. Magic in the air. Young performers can take lesson. Oh, that's right, they'd have to sing too. OOPS!",1202774400,,155,4.571428571428571
7954084,5,B00005TNG6,I thought this DVD was wonderful. My husband and I watched the DVD as soon as it arrived and we thought that Roberta gave a very solid performance. Roberta and her band sounded great. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in a recent Roberta Flack live performance.,1189296000,,276,4.653061224489796
7954085,3,B00005TNG6,This DVD is a great concert for a true Roberta fan. Mostly because the recorded concerts are so hard to find. Be I really enjoyed this dvd. The quality is really superior(sound and picture). The only negitive is that it's not long enough. I went and seen Roberta in concert last night in Memphis and she only done 9 songs just like this DVD concert. Leaving people wanting more.,1137369600,6,378,4.492753623188406
7954086,4,B00005TNG6,"This concert was very intimate with the fans. I could really tell you my favorite part was the very ending when she sang ""The First Time Ever I saw Your Face"" I love the feeling I get when I see her sing it live. I wish they would have put my song ""It Might Be You"" then this concert would have been great! I mean if she can do ""Sweet Geogria Brown"" she could have done ""It Might Be You"".
