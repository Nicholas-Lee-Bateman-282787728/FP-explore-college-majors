1269777,4,B00003CXN1,"I doubt the creators of this movie were looking to do something that critics would love and people would study. It's a comedy. It was meant to make you laugh and I went to see it with a couple of girlfriends and we laughed so hard we left the theater in tears! So it's about sex and bed hopping: what are young people doing today? Holding on to their chastity? It speaks real life for a lot of people and those who don't find the humor in this, that's fine. I just ask that people give it a chance. Just take the movie for what it is: a sex comedy. It's so silly and ridiculous, you just have to laugh! I recommend it to anyone willing to sit down and enjoy a silly movie.",980035200,7,672,4.022388059701493

The ONLY reason we stayed was that our daughter was in an adjacent theater watching another movie so we couldn't leave the theater and would have ended up standing around in the lobby for an hour waiting for her movie to end.

It was moronic and basically just plain stupid....nuff said since I think you'll get the idea I'm trying to give you here.",1264464000,,620,4.245762711864407
1269859,1,B00003CXN1,"I don't usually give one-star reviews...this is the first and probably only time I will do so.  I saw this ""film"" when it came out, at the theater, and the anger and disgust I felt toward it at the time has not gone away (if anything, it's only increased), and so I feel compelled to write this review, even though it's a number of years later, and vent some of my outrage.

Let me start by saying that most bad movies are bad because, for whatever reason, they just don't work, and they're either boring or simply not funny.  Off the top of my head, I can think of several films made by ex-SNL cast members which fit in this category.  Those type of films I can excuse.  They are what they are, and they generally don't aim very high to begin with.

This, though, is something else entirely.  This is a movie that aims to be more than a mere gross-out comedy. It aims for a kind of social commentary, and to say something meaningful about men, about women, about the way they relate to one another, etc etc.  The only problem is, it doesn't know what to say, or how to say it, and so it fails miserably, both as social commentary and as entertainment.

The main male characters are repellant, obnoxious, truly hateful people, and I would not want to know, be around, or have anything to do with any of them.  There's no reason why any one else with any class or intelligence, male or female, would either, despite what the filmmakers would want us to believe.  The ""dialogue"" is crude, simplistic, and painfully unfunny, and it is downright unpleasant to hear.  And yet, at the same time, it's implied that these are witty, urbane, intelligent adults, and that despite their smugness, crudeness, and narcissism, we're supposed to identify with and even like them.  Ha!  Nothing could be more preposterous...except maybe the so-called plot twist at the end.

I could go on, but I won't, except to say that this is a bad movie on every level, and without exaggeration, one of the worst I've ever seen.",1203724800,2,2000,4.501385041551247
1269860,1,B00003CXN1,"If I ever make a list of the worst movies I've seen in my life, Whipped will certainly be in the top (bottom?) five. Amanda Peet must have been in desperate need of money to agree to participate in this annoying, idiotic and witless movie.

The only thing worse than the screenplay are the male actors. Granted, they are not given much to play with, since their characters are such stereotypes they might as well be cardboard cutouts (the geek, the player, the boring married guy) but still, I have rarely seen such terrible and unappealing performances on the screen.

As for writer-director Jonathan Abrahams, what can I say? If this guy managed studio executives to finance and distribute this movie, he could probably sell snow to Alaskans. Abrahams should be in sales, not in movies.",1163289600,,788,4.786764705882353

1269862,1,B00003CXN1,"Synopsis
Brad, Zeke and Jonathan along with their adulterous married friend Eric sleep around brazenly until they meet the cute and sexy Mia (Amanda Pete).  As each of the men seeks her affections (her carnal ones), they suddenly become aware that she has been dating all of them at once.  It becomes a battle to decide which guy will get her in the end, and a question of whether their friendships can survive the inevitable climactic decision she makes.
About the Movie:
It amazes me sometimes at what studios and directors think makes for great entertainment.  Writer/Director Peter Cohen proves the stereotype of men that he's trying to play on in this movie just by the mere fact that he made it.  He seems to try to say that women can be a lot like men in their philandering and mind games, but he clearly misses the irony of the whole situation. It says a whole lot about his OWN character in that he made a movie that only hornball men would ever want to watch.
Whipped represents what has become standard with many Gen-X comedies these days, unoriginal sexual romps filled with disgusting toilet humor, gross sexual gags (Gagging being the operative word here), constant swearing and attractive women without their clothes on (but without the nudity...).  While, I can find that last thing appealing, it's the rest that completely turned me off of this movie.
This movie deliberately tries to be disgusting and shameless, and it succeeds easily, while at the same time, undoubtedly turning off a good portion of its audience.  Not that it would matter to the director, whose characters brazenly talk about gross sexual acts in public places without turning a single head. He also seems to think (based on the synopsis on the back cover) that his disgusting male characters are ""typical males.""  Obviously, he considers people like me as ""abnormal"" and ""big prudes"" in that I DON'T do and talk about those things.
But honestly, what makes any of this stuff funny?  Why would a man sticking his arm into a toilet filled with urine to retrieve something he dropped into it be considered funny?  Why would I think characters discussing their gross bodily function sex experiences were funny?  Why would a man cheating on his spouse be funny?
It's not funny and it really is in incredibly poor taste.  But matters like ""Taste"" obviously don't matter these days, in a time where the lowest common denominator has become the goal to strive for.  Indeed, this movie is eagerly following the gross-out trend set by movies like American Pie.
But honestly, in terms of pure sexual comedy, there are quite a few films that manage to be funnier without the gross-out factor and the complete and total disregard for taste.
And taste is only half of it. In real life, men like these very quickly end up with sexually transmitted diseases (like AIDS, which is killing tens of millions all over the world, as you read this).  And like many movies, the director seems to think that all that irresponsible and dangerous sexual activity is all right, just so long as you mention the word ""condom"" at least once.
As for the movie itself?  This is a forgettable one. Many of the comic gags pulled in this film are worn out overused clichs that have been used a thousand times before. The screenplay itself is not that well written, and while some of the actors do a moderately decent job (Amanda Peet being one), many of the performances come off as weak and over the top.  The incessant swearing of the actors (that the director mistakenly seems to equate with ""realism"") doesn't help any.
Then there's the story itself, of a women putting it over on philandering men...  It's been done many times before, often in far better films than this one.
Honestly? This movie isn't worth the time of most viewers.  Of course, if the viewer happens to like gross bathroom and sex humor, then this movie may just be for them after all.
About the DVD:
Whipped comes in a plastic hard case on a double sided DVD with both fullscreen and widescreen versions in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. It has not been translated into any other languages besides its original English, though it does contain English, French and Spanish subtitles.  Both the video and audio transfer appear to be very good. Even on a high resolution screen, the video had only a little grain and few artifacts.
As far as special features, this DVD contains the theatrical trailers and a director's commentary. I honestly didn't have the desire to watch the movie again, so I can't say whether or not the commentary is worth the time to listen to.
Bottom Line: A gross, unexciting and unoriginal movie on basic no frills DVD release. If you think bathroom humor is disgusting, this is one to avoid. 1 Star.",1073952000,20,4745,4.717049576783555
1269863,1,B00003CXN1,"Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever...",1070323200,5,347,4.1940298507462686
1269864,1,B00003CXN1,"Every Sunday, a trio of buds get together at a NYC diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before. Sometimes they're joined by a newlywed ex-comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle. They're unabashed horn dogs and corn dogs and Mia, who witnesses them on the prowl, decides that they need to be taught a lesson, dammit. So she'll date and dump - why not? All of them!

Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty gal. Women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to. As much as men do, even! Honey, we got the message. We read ""Maxim"" and ""Cosmo"" too, okay?
There is one solitary laughable element in ""Whipped"". Namely the fact that not once, during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the oral talents of the bed partners they trash, do the other customers in the diner turn around and say, ""Dude, we're trying to EAT here.""
To see quality gross-out humor, try a classic like ""Blazing Saddles"".
To see love-rat buddies hanging out, slagging and bragging on their women as they eat and imbibe, rent ""Swingers"". Priceless bits: ""How long will you guys wait to call your babies?"" ""6 days."" Plus the luminous Heather Graham.
To see the lovely Amanda Peet at her snarky, man-eating best, try ""Saving Silverman"", a.k.a. ""Evil Woman"". That flick also has the sweet Amanda Detmer (""Final Destination""). Plus the excellent Steve Zahn.
But this - merciful God, this. It's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting, a smart, cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop-out ending.
The leads are very attractive and approach the material with relish - let's hope more worthy projects are in their future.
P.S. - 30 ""whip-oosh"" sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase ""You go, girl"". It was tired in 2000, and it's tired now.",1055894400,12,1867,4.657575757575757

Holy cow does Amanda Peet look good or what; she does an excellent job on this film. I think that this was the film that got me noticing her, the next film I remember her in after that was the great ""Saving Silverman"". Man when I first watched this movie I was living in Maryland and had bought this movie at Blockbuster just cause. It turned out to be a good thing I did because I absolutely loved this movie, as did my friends. After taking my usual route walking home I decided to go over to my friends house, everyone was there and we watched this drinking red Kool Aid [love it]. Once it was over I realized that everyone in the room loved it as much as me, and we were all laughing out loud.

For some reason people hate on this movie but I thought it was brilliant, everyone around me agrees 100%. The film is all about a group of friends [the jock type guy, the smooth type guy, and the loser guy who makes his stories up] that meet at a restaurant once a week to talk about their adventures with women, the unwanted friend there is the married guy. One day they all meet this one girl who one by one they all fall in love with, when they find out they are all going out with her the go to war. The film is so funny because I know for a fact that women can do this to guys, turn best friends on one another. Of course there is a nice little twist at the end that adds to the laughs, poor guys.

 Writer/director/producer Peter M. Cohen did a really great job. The film is very funny, and pits men's hunger for more women vs. evil women [ha ha]. I think this man may have had experienced something like this because it feels so real. And all the actors in this film do outstanding jobs; the married guy and the loser guy in particular are great. But everyone in this film do outstanding jobs and should be praised for doing so.

On the real though, this is a very good comedy and needs your support because some [people] like to hate.",1053388800,2,1950,4.1345646437994725

I love Amanda Peet and was excited to see this, and while she does a decent job, the film is just silly and trite.  And sorry to disagree with the other reviewer from Denver who compared it to Sex and the City...but I know Sex and the City and this is no Sex and the City!  Sex and the City is not only trendy and fun, but intellegent and insightful.  There is nothing intellegent about this film and nothing insightful about these characters.  (And if there were no such thing as anti-gay slurs and slang terms, this writer would have had trouble getting much of a script together at all!)

Anyone who claims it to be a 'realistic' or 'satirical' portrait of anything resembling real life has, like this movie, no actual connection to the real world.

There are plenty of side-kicking outrageous new ""terms"" for dating, doing the deed, and for chicks.  Guess I picked up on a lot of new slang I had never heard of-and the slang is hilarious. (...)  If you like Porky's, Naked Gun, and of course, Sex & City type of humor, you will simply love this movie!  I've watched it maybe about 30 times-if a movie is really funny I get stuck on it-I would say this is a ""real"" compliment to the movie.

All in all a great movie with many quotables... the only negative thing I can say about this film is that it didn't have the best of endings... but it certainly didn't spoil this fine film.,1006646400,2,482,4.138297872340425

1269911,5,B00003CXN1,"A hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer/director Peter M. Cohen.  The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes. We meet Brad: a good-looking, wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams; and Eric: the married guy, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence.  The trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in New York are amusingly expressed, mirroring that of ""Sex in the City"" and HBO's new comedy ""The Mind of Married Man, and bring an astute light to scamming.
The story takes a twist as the three singletons meet Mia--wittily played by Amanda Peet&#8212;and all fall for her. She seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit. When they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her over their friendship.
""Whipped"" is a realistic portrayal of the dating world, one that the critic's failed to recognize. In plain language, they missed the point. The protagonist's here are caricatures of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests. See this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.",1002585600,11,1543,5.047058823529412
1269912,4,B00003CXN1,"I wanted to see this movie because I am a big fan of Amanda Peet.  I love her in ""Jack & Jill.""  But I didn't expect it to be so funny.  Thank God my relationships aren't as convoluted as these - at least not from my point of view.  But once we stopped laughing, my girlfriends and I had to admit that guys - even the ones we know - can be pretty weird.  It's cute.
The big surprise - and my favorite part - turned out to be the director's commentary.  I've never heard of Peter Cohen but he seems adorable.  I recommend the DVD for the commentary alone.

Predictably, they all end-up involved with the same girl (Mia, played by the super-cute Amanda Peet). The execution of that twist is well-done and works to inject interesting irony under the humor. But that's really the only thing going in the whole plot. The conflict development happens a little bit late in the movie, which makes it something of a slow start. (Just a little. I mean, it's not as a bad as ""Snow Falling on Cedars"".)
The to-the-camera narratives are done out-of-context of the movie, which makes them plausible and less awkward than in most other movies that try this silly technique. And since they're less awkward, they come off as a little bit more insightful.
The plot resolution is a little ambiguous, and kind of sudden. But the movie examines the aftermath very deeply, and that's where it makes its point; that's where the real curve ball comes out.",997315200,,1126,4.720812182741117

Wow, how noble. He must be a great person, sweet, insightful and so above the characters in this movie. And that's what he wants you to believe, especially if he has to sign his name. It's not about the movie, it's about the critic!
Sorry, but Whipped is the awful dark truth, if you can take it. Play with fire and you get burned, and a woman can be a lot more dangerous than fire. I laughed my head off. Guys do talk about girls and sex exactly that way.  Women respond in kind. Especially in brazen NYC. You know it and I know it. Sex and the City is just as brazen, except with a bunch of screwed-up, narcissistic women and whoa, it's an artistic triumph. A bunch of guys do it here and this movie belongs in the toilet. What hypocrisy.
The kicker in this movie is the voiceover at the end when Zeke hopes that Mia is ok. He's actually worried about her. Little does he know, of course, that she's at dinner with her friends mocking the guys, brutally, at that very moment.
The great thing about this show is that the director shows compassion towards his characters. I liked them actually. They grow on you. One of the main points here is that beneath the bravado, the guys are very vulnerable, and sort of sweet in a way. They're young enough to be fairly innocent about how genuinely nasty women can be.  Brad pines for romance and intimacy in a park. And the raunchy talk is just that, talk. Can't anybody look a little deeper? We also see how a woman's sexual power far outweighs a man's. And the irony here is that sweet, beautiful Mia is really the monster here, splitting up friendships and toying with hearts in a calculating, incredibly deceptive manner, all in the name of revenge for some misbegotten idea of sisterhood and to impress her friends. And a perceptive viewer should notice that even she has a convoluted sense of purpose--in her explanation at the end, she toyed with these guys for what reason, exactly?
Forget Tomb Raider or A.I. or Moulin Rouge or any of that overblown crap. These cheapo movies are where it's at, and describe the zeitgeist far better than most Hollywood flicks. I also recommend the movie Siberia to see the flip side.",995760000,9,2356,4.604761904761904

The scenes of the guys sharing breakfast discussing their dating experiences and strategies really hit to home for me...right down to the jokes about self-abuse (you know, the hairy palms and going blind)and asking ""who will jump on the grenade?"" which is when 3 girls are in a group and one is ugly/fat and 3 guys are checking them out, zeroing in for the kill, one guy is going to have to ""jump on the grenade"", sacrifice himself so the other two can bag the hot chicks...I have been there man, thank godness someone put that fine tradition on film! The married guy Eric who shares their wonderful conversations is delightfully sleazy, every guy has known someone like him. There are great jokes in this movie and even some toilet humor that will have you rolling.

1269960,3,B00003CXN1,"my title's a little harsh - this is a worthwhile movie, to rent at the very least.  apparently never intended as a major release, ""whipped"" has garnered comparisons to another movie that looked at the late 90s twentysomethings dating scene, ""swingers"".  this time around, three friends recall their weekly sexual exploits.  each one is a stereotype, with brad as the good-looking egotistical jerk guy, zeke as the seemingly more intellectual, freaky, extremely angry and egotistical jerk guy, and jonathan as the sensitive ""for the last time guys, i'm not gay"" guy.  i'm exagerrating, but oftentimes their characters fall into that predictable trap.  they all happen to fall for the same woman and each of them refuses to part with this seemingly amazing girl.  she seems to have tamed two untamable lions, and of course, she's got jon wrapped around her fingers after she was cool with his taste for auto-eroticism and pornography.  and despite the fights between the so-called buddies (they never really act like friends from that point on), no one really seems to find a problem with mia's dating three men at once except for the guys' married buddy, eric.  it's rather predictable however, that mia is more than the innocent lovebird she seems to be, and that these fools, as the title indicates, are getting outplayed in their own game.  i won't ruin the ending for you, as mia isn't the witch she could have been.  she portrays a woman who can be just as scheming as any man, which is a little refreshing to see, especially since it's so true, and while some of the characters (especially zeke who is perpetually angry/cursing at something) are simply unlikeable and a little exaggerated, there are many people who are very much like this out there.  it's no ""swingers"", but it'll make you laugh, even through the shameless and pretty much pointless toilet gag, because a good amount of this is true.  eric's role is a nice touch and provides a needed dose of relief from zeke and brad's outrageous machismo.  recommended for anyone's who's heard/given a cheesy pickup line.",992131200,6,2080,4.8917378917378915

1269963,4,B00003CXN1,"""Whipped"" opens with three guys having their weekly Sunday brunch at a New York diner.  We have Brad (Brian Van Holt), the lady-killer with the high-paying job on Wall Street, Zeke (Zorie Barber), the intellectual type who spends his days writing in coffee houses, and the overly sensitive Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams), who apparently does not do anything other than wish he was at good as ""scamming"" as his two buddies.  While Brad uses the ""you look like my sister's friend"" scam to score and Zeke brings home two babes who proceed to steal his television set, Jonathan's sexual experiences involve ""Keri,"" named for his hand lotion de jour.  At their next meeting all three have stories about a woman they met during the week who might actually prove there is something better than scamming.  But as each relates their story, we realize it is all the same woman, which is exactly what all three guys discover when they all arrive at the apartment of Mia (Amanda Peete).  Despite some initial awkwardness, none of them are willing to back off from the new relationship.  Of course, each is convinced he is Mia's true love and the lady does nothing to dissuade any of them, to the consternation of their married friend Eric (Judah Domke), who lives vicariously for their erotic experiences.
Writer-Producer-Director Peter M. Cohen writes snappy dialogue replete with expletives and he is concerned not only with the relationships these guys have with the mysterious Mia but with each other as well.  The obvious influences on Cohen's style as writer-director would be Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen and the Farley Brothers.  There are comic vignettes, including a few crude ones that do not fit the overall tone of the film and caused ratings concerns.  For all their interest in scamming, it simply never dawns on these guys that they would ever meet a woman they would not want to sleep with on the first date or that any woman could ever come between them as friends.  Their protestations of special feelings for Mia would suggest that these guys are not as shallow as they seem, but in the end there is nothing to really suggest they are not either emotionally immature or sterile.
The performances of male actors are adequate, given that they are playing characters rather than real people, but it is Amanda Peet' who holds the story together.  If we do not believe that these guys find her desirable, the whole thing gets flushed down the toilet (you'll understand that one after you watch the film).  It would have been nice if Whipped had been her breakout film, but better luck next time.  In terms of extra features all this DVD offers are trailers and a commentary track Cohen, who impressed me by addressing a lot of the questions that came to my mind as I watched the film (e.g., how come there's no nudity for a film that is so much about sex?).  An above average commentary track to be sure.  Ultimately, the main problem with ""Whipped"" is that when we get to the rather predictable twist at the end of the film it is hard to tell if this is just the final punch line or a more cynical statement on contemporary relationships between the sexes.",991008000,6,3160,4.730418943533698
1270024,5,B00003CXN1,Ignore completely the terribly slanted review of the....... writer and the top of this page.  This movie is laoded with side splitting scenes.  Its basically a light-hearted looking at the scamming side of dating and each character is pretty darn hillarious.  Over exaggerated yes but the diner scenes are cool and the scene where the sensitive musician enters Amanda Peet's apartment to find the other two guys fighting over her just tickles my funny bone pink!  Then when the married guy approaches Amanda Peete in her apartment complaining that she broke up their guy bonding meetings is another great moment.  The ending where Amanda Peete is holding court is a nice swerve as there are plenty of lady players out there.  For a dose of fun pick this one up.,986688000,5,761,4.815384615384615

1270026,5,B00003CXN1,"At first, I was very skeptical about buying this DVD.  Mostly due to the bad critical reviews.  The film however, pleasantly surprised me.
I watched the ""Whipped"" DVD this past Thursday with a few friends, male and female, and couldn't believe how funny and dead-on the comedy was.  When we watched it a second time, with the audio commentary, we learned an amazing truth about the movie.  It was made as an independent film for under $150,000 and shot in 1998 before Amanda Peet's ""Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Jack & Jill.""  Also, none of the other actors had ever been in a film before - they were all first timers and friends of the director's.  Why was the film's near-record budget and independent status never advertised or discussed in any of the reviews?  I remember seeing posters for the film when it came out and thinking it was a big studio comedy in the vain of ""American Pie.""  It's totally not!  It's a small black-comedy/dating-farce... and a very funny one at that.
The studio completely mis-marketed this movie.  Maybe if it had been marketed more as the independent, slice-of-life film that it is, critics  would've been more accepting of it and it's message: that some women are more like men then we'd like to believe.  The movie focuses on four scammers in New York City and what happens when a woman (Amanda Peet) gets in between their friendship.  I highly doubt that the filmmakers were trying to make an overall statement about society with this movie (as some critics tried to spin it) and I'm sure they never planned on a wide release.
After the second viewing, we came up with two reasons for why some critics and viewers possibly didn't like ""Whipped"": 1) The mis-marketing positioned it as something that it's not, which always pisses off everybody -- especially critics.  And the more obvious reason: 2) Because they totally couldn't relate to it.  Most critics are 40+, single, slovenly, and probably couldn't get a date if their life depended on it.  Of course they're going to hate it.
If you can't relate to the reality of dating as portrayed in a film like ""Whipped,"" or you have a hard time believing that there are people out there (men and women) exactly like the characters in this movie, than go outside for change and see for yourself.  Open your eyes and stop criticizing what you don't know and/or can't relate to.
""Whipped"" is insightful, real, funny, and incredibly entertaining.",983923200,12,2421,4.7398568019093075
1270027,5,B00003CXN1,I don't know what the critics are talking about.  Whipped was hysterical and I went back and bought it.  I've watched it five times with friends and we fell on the floor laughing.  This is a must own!,982195200,7,200,4.2105263157894735
1270028,4,B00003CXN1,"If you saw ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and became an Amanda Peet fan, take heed.  ""Whipped"" is nothing like ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and neither is Peet's character, Mia.  If you're looking for Amanda to repeat the same type of character in this film, you'll be disappointed.
  ""Whipped"" has similarities ""In The Company of Men"", but is a much lighter and funnier film.  The story centers around three men in their twenties who look at sex like a sporting event.  Every Sunday they gather at a diner and compare tales of their latest conquests.  Everything is going well for the guys until Mia (played by Peet) comes into the picture.
  While the script isn't 100% hilarious, it does have some great moments.  There are some good lines and a smattering of funny scenes, albeit cynical humor.  Rather than write about them, see the movie and judge for yourself.
  ""Whipped"" is not a great film, but it does have some good laughs.  If you liked comedies like ""Love Stinks"" and ""After Hours"", you'll most likely enjoy ""Whipped"".",981763200,12,1018,4.7102272727272725
1270029,4,B00003CXN1,"Okay, having recently made a movie and received numerous critism for it's 'idiodic' and 'vulgar' plot, I have to say that Whipped is a fun, true to life comedy. If you don't want to admit it, than I will, THERE ARE GUYS AND GIRLS that talk this way and do these things. Yes, some characters, such as the married guy,  are slightly blown up, but overall this was a fun and entertaining movie that puts the sexes a little closer together. So if you don't like or understand the modern young dating scene then don't watch this movie cause you'll just be wasting your time, but if you do then get ready for a hilarious ride!",981676800,5,620,4.344827586206897
1270030,2,B00003CXN1,"Brad, Zeke, Jonathan, and Eric are friends that meet every Sunday and discuss their sexual encounters.  Brad is the smooth talking Wall Street guy (the BIGGEST LOSER in the bunch), Zeke is the tough writer (almost as big a loser as Brad), Jonathan the shy, bad with women, artisy type (the only charcater in the film that is half-way normal, except for the Karma Chameleon scene), and Eric the married guy, who is living his fantasies through his three friends.
As these three casanova's try to bed everything they come into contact with, they meet Mia (the awesome Amanda Peet), a young, single NY woman who happens to be attracted to each of the guys.
Unknowingly, all three friends have begun dating Mia, each thinking that they have found the woman they could settle down with, but when they realize they all are seeing the same woman, they wage an ALL OUT WAR to win the heart of Mia, but are they prepared for the outcome? Who will Mia choose?
""Whipped"" is not a good movie.
Now, on to the only good stuff in the movie...Amanda Peet, she is funny, sexy, and although, this part is not as good as her scene stealing turn in ""The Whole Nine Yards"", she does give the movie's best performance.
If you have nothing else to watch, or if you just want to see Amanda Peet, then rent this, for any other other reason you would be wasting your time and money.

It does have some funny moments - although it will only appeal to those who like crass humor such as myself. The key point of the movie is that three complete losers fall in  love with the same woman and she plays games with them.
The funny moments come when the three would be Lotharios detail their strategies for bedding women and when their married friend tries to intervene. Also contains disgusting sexual humor concerning analingus, toilets and group sex.

It's not the typical Hollywood formula crap they keep shoving down our throats, like ""Boy and Girls"" and ""Loser.""  I guess I can understand why a lot of critics and people found it offensive, probably because they went in expecting it to be something more, like a crappy Freddie Pinze movie with some kind of ridiculous Hollywood message.  ""Whipped"" is pure entertainment and comedy. It's a simple slice of life movie focusing on the ups and down of dating in NYC.
I really enjoyed the director's commentary on the DVD, because it talked a lot about the making of the film.
