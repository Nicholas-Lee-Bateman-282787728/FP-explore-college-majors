7879135,5,6304860420,"Alchemy in Light:Making Art Glass, a video documentary, is an intriguing and illuminating view into the creative and technical work of making art glass.
It's inspiring to see artists so involved  in the fluid and capricious process of  making art glass, to see the results, to hear their individual experiences of the creative process and what it means to them.
I've seen this video several times and it's just as exciting and inspiring as the first viewing.  Anyone who is interested in or works in any art  form can enjoy and even benefit from this video.",1009756800,9,557,4.770833333333333
