The real star of the show is the lovely Christine Harnos who plays Nikki, a cop bent on avenging her father's death who reluctantly accepts assistance from a crime author. Anyway, not much acting or plot here, but the show has some high points. One especially is an opening scene where the dark haired sexy and sinewy Nikki is undercover wearing a black slitted dress in high heels..and man does she have nice legs! When the bust goes down she single handedly dispatches with the baddies using some fast karate kicks. When police backup arrives they are stunned to see the main baddie knocked out cold while she stands proudly with one foot on him, and a gun pointing at other bad guy. There's some other good action throughout and Christine does play the femme fatale role well.",1138320000,5,858,4.61437908496732
