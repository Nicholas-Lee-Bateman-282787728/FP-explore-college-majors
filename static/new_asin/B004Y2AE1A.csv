4498630,5,B004Y2AE1A,"I can only give the highest review for this documentary.  There are tons of this type of material being released right now, but this one is done right.  First, they give a very specific life story, showing how the great showman came into being.  Second, they went into all of the insane gimmicks that he used in each and every picture he released.  Third, they showed his influence, especially on a certain Mr. Alfred Hitchcock, who made 'Psycho' as a direct copy of the production technique and exploitation marketing campaign that William Castle had pioneered.

the interviews are many and wonderful, with such great film makers as John Waters, John Landis, and Joe Dante, among many others.  The special features go into much greater details in the interviews.  It is especially interesting to see how, late in life, success - in the form of 'Rosemary's Baby' - really ruined him, in a perverse way.  My only complaint is that they don't cover ""Confessions of an Opiate Eater"", an obscure 1964 Vincent Price film that comes off as a racist fever dream.

Overall, if you like movies, and really like the seamy side of the street, this documentary is as good as I have seen.",1313280000,5,1175,4.720588235294118
4498631,5,B004Y2AE1A,"A delightful and insightful look at the consummate huckster and showman.  Some incredibly rare footage, especially revolving around Castle's little seen curio ""Shanks.""  This is a must own for lovers of kitsch and camp.",1412294400,,219,5.411764705882353
4498632,5,B004Y2AE1A,"Having grown up watching William Castle's films when I was a kid at the kiddie matinee on Saturdays, and owning his autobiography, I had to have this film version of his career.  His is larger than life and well worth watching.",1398124800,,227,4.536585365853658

4498635,5,B004Y2AE1A,Fascinating documentory about this famous director. Excellent quality and brought back memories of the movies he made in the 1950-1960's.,1363132800,,137,5.9
4498636,1,B004Y2AE1A,I read on a pretty well known movie review site that this doc was awesome and one of the best so I believed what I had read and purchased this and about 20 minutes into it I fell asleep and a movie has to be really really boring for me to fall asleep It was just a boring little story about a b-movie type producer and I should have loved it because I love docs like this for example The Haunted World Of Ed Wood awesome I watch it all the time but this Spine Tingler just not alot going on in this doc so I say to you the reviewer pass on this one.,1359331200,,549,3.782608695652174
4498637,5,B004Y2AE1A,"It was great to relive the Castle experience that I remember so well as a child.
Macabre / House on Haunted Hill / The Tingler / 13 Ghosts / Homicidal are my favorites.",1355702400,,168,4.121212121212121
4498638,5,B004Y2AE1A,"This is a fantastic documentary. I've seen it a couple of times now. I'm going to watch it again soon. I had to have my own copy, which is why I bought this DVD.",1355184000,,161,3.764705882352941
4498639,5,B004Y2AE1A,"For Castle fans this DVD is a must.  Of course we've seen a lot of this before in some form - Castle talking in his trailers and in his gimmick films, and explanations of the gimmicks, but this film seems fresh and new and will also intrigue those who know very little of this great showman as well as die-hard fans.  For the first time we are given quite a decent account of his early years, so we can see what led up to the wacky films of the late 50s and early 60s, and it goes on to cover the end of his career.  You do get a sense of what he must have been like and at times it's quite moving to hear Terry Castle talking about her fab Dad. Lots of extras too.  If I have any criticism it's that the sound on the extra interviews (obviously filmed as best could be managed at recent showings of ""The Tingler"" and ""Spine Tingler!"") is uneven, so you have to turn the volume way up sometimes to hear what's being said.  But these are extras after all so it's a minor niggle.  Overall I really enjoyed the documentary and learned a few new things about Castle and his films.",1334534400,,1076,4.1
4498640,5,B004Y2AE1A,"This superbly done documentary covers the life and career of William Castle, the master of movie promotion.  He was the guy that popularized gimmicks like a life insurance policy which would pay if anyone died of fright during his film Macabre and wired movie theater seats to give patrons a ""buzz"" during the Tingler.

His influence is even felt today in the 2011 Spy Kids: All the Time in the World which took a page out of Castle's playbook with their scratch-and-sniff ""Aroma-Scope"" gimmick.

Furthermore, the DVD is crammed full with over 5 hours of extras presenting a tremendous value for the money.

If you are a horror buff, grindhouse enthusiast or just interested in marketing, you should buy this DVD.",1315785600,8,713,4.867768595041323

8447871,5,B004Y2AE1A,"A wonderful documentary about a great showman full of ideas, quirks and frugality. I didn't want it to end. Castle never got the respect he deserved in his lifetime (aside from his ability to turn a profit) but today there is a whole new generation of movie lovers who appreciate his innovations and accomplishments. He made going to the movies fun! Well paced and edited. All of the guest interviews add insight into the man. It's always nice to see that his surviving friends and family have nothing but joyful memories about him. Anything with John Waters - and I'm there!

I've already made plans to have Emergo as a feature at my funeral.",1504137600,,643,4.640350877192983

8447878,5,B004Y2AE1A,"William Castle was a great director of ""B"" films, which might seem a contradiction in terms but Castle films like The Tingler and 13 Ghosts are today far more memorable than many of the ""A"" movies of the time. He was a showman and a personality in his own right, injecting himself in his movies in obvious, and not-so-obvious ways. This is an awesome bit of film history and a fun story in its own right.",1416700800,,404,4.328947368421052
8447879,5,B004Y2AE1A,"The DVD is vastly superior to the Instant Video.

Was not happy with the quality of instant video. The DVD is spectacular.

I can remember going to see a couple of William Castle movies on a Saturday matinee.  We had to sign a liability release in case we ""died of fright"" during the movie.

If you are a William Castle fan, be sure to buy ""Matinee"" on DVD.  Matinee is a 5 star movie about William Castle.",1412467200,,406,4.220779220779221
