3491460,5,B001BGS16C,The first DVD is a very comprehensive history of the early Browns.  The second is the marathon playoff victory against the NY Jets which just makes this combo DVD collection a must have for a true Browns fan.,1244505600,,208,4.473684210526316
3491461,4,B001BGS16C,"I got this as a girft for my boyfriend who LOVES the browns. He loved this DVD but said some of the game coverage went a bit long, that was the only downfall.",1237766400,,158,3.8181818181818183
3491462,5,B001BGS16C,THis 2 DVD set is awesome- very interesting history and good choice of games to highlight.  I must-see for Browns fans. (You'd probably want to skip it if you're from Pittsburgh).  :-),1232668800,,184,4.71875
3491463,5,B001BGS16C,I bought this dvd for my father and brother. They are huge Cleveland Browns fans. I knew this would be something they would really enjoy.,1231372800,,137,4.52
3491464,5,B001BGS16C,"Honestly, I thought this was a fantastic DVD.  If you are a Browns fan, this is a must own.  More than once, this brought a tear to my eye -- particularly at the end.  It really did a fine job documenting the ups and downs -- the emotional roller-coaster -- the agony, and the heartbreak of being born and raised on the Cleveland Browns.  The only thing I found peculiar was the lack of attention given to Belichick's debacle as a head coach.  It seemed like the NFL wanted to exonerate him for his less-than-stellar tenure.  Likewise, the DVD tries to gloss over Modell moving the team to Baltimore.  Perhaps it's because they are trying to put him in the Hall of Fame, or perhaps it's because he didn't break the hearts of millions of fans and sell his soul for a Super Bowl...oh, wait...  Other than those minor flaws, this DVD is an essential for Browns fans.",1229385600,7,863,4.417721518987341
3491465,5,B001BGS16C,"Product came as described.  Don't know about the quality of the dvd yet, it is a Christmas gift for my husband.  Would definiately buy from this seller again.",1229299200,,158,4.607142857142857
3491466,4,B001BGS16C,"This is a fun look back at a wonderful team.  For a long time the Browns led the way in championship football. In many ways the Browns taught the NFL how to win in foot ball.

Did not like how they glossed over major events in team history.  The move to Baltomore, I would have liked more details and given more insight on how ugly it was.  I still consider it a personal loss.",1227312000,5,377,4.054054054054054
3491467,5,B001BGS16C,"This is meant for that Die Hard fan of the most storied franchise in NFL history.  I recommend for any Browns fan, as it will take you through the ups and downs of the last 65 years of the team.  It will bring back the memories of Bernie's years, and of the Cardiac Kids.  It's a must buy for a Browns fan!",1226275200,,306,3.903225806451613
3491468,5,B001BGS16C,"With all the football dvd's out,now there is finally a dvd about the Cleveland Browns. This 2 dvd set on the Cleveland Browns is nicely done and the dvd quality is good. The first dvd is about the Browns history and the second dvd has highlights from the Browns VS. Jets playoff game that went into double overtime. The second dvd also has some bonuses on it,the highlights of the Browns 1980 season is good. Being from Cleveland,Ohio this dvd set brings back lots of memories of some of the games my dad and I went to and watched on tv in the 70's.",1224979200,4,549,4.288461538461538
3491469,4,B001BGS16C,"The first DVD is the history DVD.  This DVD was pretty good and covered most of the memorable moments in their history.  The reason I give it only 4 stars is because it lacks a lot of detail such as why Modell did the things he did, Kosar's exit, the rebirth, etc. I really wanted them to get into the behind the scenes of what really happened but they didn't.

The second DVD is really cool.  We start with the Greatest Games series and the 1986 playoff game between the Browns and Jets.  Great show with a lot of detail and interviews.  There are three player specials. One of Bernie Kosar, Ozzie Newsome, & Frank Ryan.  The last feature is the highlight film of the 1980 Kardiac Kids team.  Good special features DVD. Great job!

This is certainly worth it for any Browns fan.  Any questions about this DVD...just ask.",1223683200,15,821,4.413333333333333

3491494,3,B001BGS16C,"Mostly good history of the Browns until the very end, when it spends 15 minutes on the terrible Browns team a year before this DVD was made, I think it was the 2007 Browns, where there is 0% interesting information. Would have rather they skipped the ""modern"" Browns to make this more of a timeless history of the organization.",1423440000,2,327,4.559322033898305

3491534,5,B001BGS16C,"Another gift for my husband.  He is a mega Browns fan and probably knows it all, but it is nice to be able to watch it without his commentary, which probably won't happen. lol",1386892800,2,175,4.147058823529412
3491535,5,B001BGS16C,I bought this cause my dad is into history and football... why not combine the two. Made an excellent Christmas present this year,1386720000,,129,4.6521739130434785

3491537,4,B001BGS16C,This was good but I was actually looking for some old (60's) footage.  My husband started watching football as a kid in the 60's and was looking for more of that footage.,1360195200,,170,4.3125

3491571,5,B001BGS16C,"I live in Brazil and less than one year I started getting interested in the NFL championship. Finding statistics from the NFL, I was very interested in knowing more about the team Cleveland Browns. The two discs of the History of the Cleveland Browns fully met my expectations. This is a very well produced film, provides an adequate level of knowledge about the team, has the right time duration, neither too long nor too short, and presents some very interesting bonus. I liked it and point to the fans of the Cleveland Browns and NFL football.",1342915200,,546,4.697916666666667
3491572,5,B001BGS16C,"NFL History of the Cleveland Browns is a great NFL film. While I would have liked to have seen more interviews with some of the Browns greats of the 80's and early 90', it was fun to relive some of those memories of Municipal Stadium. To see highlights of championship teams from the 40's and 50's reminds me of why my family passed down Browns fandom. Every die hard Brownie needs to own this film and watch it every year after we go 4-12 and remind themselves as to why they hold out hope that ""Maybe Next Year.""",1328227200,,514,4.255102040816326

3491574,5,B001BGS16C,"I think this is an excellent set for someone who has just become a Browns fan. The DVD retracing their history is very educational. I also like the DVD highlighting one the Browns greatest games (Browns vs. Jets), Bernie Kosar, Frank Ryan, Ozzie Newsome, and the 1980 Browns team. This would be a good DVD set for a longtime Browns fan as well.",1306454400,,344,4.476190476190476
3491575,5,B001BGS16C,"I do not really have a lot of insight into this as I am only 25.  I grew up a browns fan, but I was so young at the time and do not remember much from early 90s.  When I was about 11, The Move woke me up.  My fanatical, borderline insanity love for the browns was born in '99 when the team moved back.

Wish I was born earlier...

You baby boomers have experienced a lot of ups and downs with this team.  I'm so freakin' jealous.  There have been only downs since I have been a die hard pretty much.  Yeah you've never seen the bowl, but it was a helluva ride.  To be able to go to the dawg pound without getting kicked out for ""excessive standing"", to see the great players, coaches, smuggling beer kegs hidden in a dog house, no undercover cops in steelers gear, and some DAMN WINS,  SOME PHYSICAL PRESENCE THAT KNOCKS PEOPLE OUT AND INJECTS FEAR INTO THE ENEMY'S MIND!

Got a little carried away there, sorry...

This DVD lets someone like me see a glimpse of what the Browns were, and hopefully can someday be again.  I'll never be able to remember those moments, but respecting the history is something any serious Browns fan should do.  You love your team? You'll love this DVD.  Watch it right after preseason, it will put you in a happy mood until the regular season starts.

Have not seen the 2nd disk.  Would be nice to see some interviews.  Like some said though, it would just kill me to see ratbird and Shart modell footage on that.  Maybe I'll poop on it and send it to yellow diarrhea stadium in pittsburgh just for the hell of it.  Is that against the law?  Oh well.

Bottom line:
If you are looking at this DVD for you, or someone you know who loves the Browns, just get it.  It may sugar coat things a bit but paints a good outline for the basic history.  I almost kind of like how it leaves out some controversial heart breaking material.  Ignorance is bliss.

There is always next year guys and gals, always next year...
