2819303,1,B000PGTF2I,Do not go with this instruction DVD my daughter hated it and it just didn't have the right information for a child to learn knitting.,1299801600,2,133,4.36
2819304,4,B000PGTF2I,This is a great video for children learning how to knit; good for adults too.  Basic steps are easy to follow and the sections on how wool is made is great.  It really captured the children's attention.,1291075200,,202,4.4324324324324325
2819305,5,B000PGTF2I,"My granddaughter, daughter and I all learned to knit from this video!  It is great!!!",1270339200,,85,4.666666666666667
2819306,4,B000PGTF2I,I bought this for my daughter's 5th birthday and we love it. I am a proficient knitter but I had no idea how to teach her. This video had her knitting within half an hour.,1261180800,4,171,3.914285714285714
2819307,5,B000PGTF2I,The video has very clear directions that a second grader can follow.  I teach second grade and have taught the students to knit. We watched how to cast on and several of the students caught on quickly.  It was a great investment.,1235779200,2,229,4.428571428571429
2819308,5,B000PGTF2I,"I wanted to teach my children to knit, but kept being stymied by my inability to put into words what needed to happen with the yarn when making the slip stitch, casting on, and knitting.  In fact, after several attempts to teach my teenage daughter (who is motivated to learn), I was informed that I was the worst teacher ever.

This DVD is a godsend for people who want to teach their children to knit but don't have the teaching skills.  The first section is taught by a young boy and he uses such cute descriptions for the actions.  Making the slip knot is ""Criss Cross Applesauce"" and he is a real inspiration to younger kids who seem to be willing to stick with it longer when they see a young child teaching.

The DVD also has a section taught by a grandmotherly woman, who also matches the knitting motions with vivid stories to help children better remember what they are supposed to do.  She also shows two young children how to make their own knitting needles--cool!

Another section shows kids how to knit a ball (or a hat, depending on your preference), and the final section takes kids on a tour of an alpaca farm.  They show how they shear the animals and turn the wool into ""roving.""  What a blast!

I highly recommend this video to anyone who would like to teach their children how to knit, or who would like very easy and non-threatening knitting instruction.",1203897600,2,1376,4.48995983935743
2819309,5,B000PGTF2I,"The Art of Knitting 4 Kids is great--very entertaining, with good teachers!

The DVD has four parts.  In the first part, a 7 year old boy, Ryan, teaches you how to knit.  He is adorable, straightforward, takes it slow, and does lots of repetition.  The camera work is particularly good in this section.  Ryan states his qualifications at the beginning of the session:  ""I've taught my mother and my grandmother how to knit.""  I believe him!

Part two:  Dr. Elizabeth Seward tells a story about a set of twins who want to learn to knit.  The story has several segments, each designed to help the kids visualize what they're going to do next.  Then she teaches those skills to a little boy and a little girl.

Part three:  Marcy Levitas Hamilton, a knitting instructor and the producer, teaches kids how to make a striped ball by knitting a rectangular strip and pulling each side together at the purl bumps.  She has a lively and friendly style.

Part four:  A visit to a real alpaca farm to learn about where knitting fibers come from, showing the fiber-making process, from shearing to spinning.  Kids would love this, as most kids have no idea where natural fibers come from!

The video is very well done, and kids will have a window into three styles of teaching knitting.  The animations for Dr. Seward's story were nicely done and in the style of Mr. Rogers--gentle and kind.  Slow enough to get the point, too.  I liked her story!

I only have two ""wish they'd done it another way"" thoughts:

1.  All three knitting instructors showed bringing the loop through the stitch by pushing on the right needle with the pointer finger of your left hand.  I have found that when new knitters do this, their pointer finger gets awfully sore!  It isn't necessary, and can be avoided by turning the right needle so that it will bring the loop back naturally, without being pushed by the left pointer finger.

2.  In Dr. Seward's segment, she asks the little girl to bind off more loosely, but she doesn't listen, and she ends up with the usual scrunched up top edge.  This is a really common problem with beginner (and sometimes experienced knitters), but can be easily avoided by using a needle 1-2 sizes larger than the one used to knit the piece.  Then you can just knit the way you normally would.

In addition, knitters who pick rather than throw may be disappointed by the video, because all three knitting teachers are throwers.  That didn't bother me, but it might bother the ""knit- picking"" adult who purchases this to help them teach their child how to knit.

All in all, the video is very entertaining, fun, appropriately paced, and offers kids several excellent opportunities to learn to knit.  I would recommend it for any kid who would like to learn to knit, and also for any adult who would like to see some effective ""teach a kid to knit"" teaching styles up close.  Very nice!",1203120000,6,2886,4.6031434184675835
2819310,5,B000PGTF2I,"My 6 year old learned how to knit about 6 months ago. She had lost interest a little bit because it ""took too long"" to finish a scarf. Since watching the very entertaining dvd, she has renewed interest and is knitting faster than before.

It covers cast on (long tail), knit stitch, purl stitch, picking up a dropped stitch and bind off.

The dvd is fun for the whole family to watch and is interactive. It teaches how to knit a ball, step by step, having you knit along and the dvd automatically pauses until you are done with the section and you press play.

It also shows how yarn is made from shearing to spinning yarn.

I highly recomend this dvd to everyone, regardless of age or knitting experience.",1189468800,20,706,4.407692307692308
2819311,5,B000PGTF2I,"I just got this DVD a few days ago, and I am in love with it.  The DVD is NOT just for children; adults who are just beginning to learn to knit can benefit from it too.  The children are adorable, and they make instructions clear (I was somewhat worried about this, but the children are GREAT) and much more entertaining and fun to watch than an adult could.  The DVD also has a very lovely woman storyteller who tells stories that go along with the steps of knitting.  These stories are memorable and help the beginner remember the order of each step.  I highly recommend this DVD for both children and adults.  You will have fun and will be knitting in no time at all.  Enjoy!",1181606400,34,678,4.291338582677166
2819312,5,B000PGTF2I,"This DVD is really wonderful!
Little Ryan is an amazing knitter and an excellent teacher. I am a knitter and he actually showed me a way to cast on, I never tried before.
As I said, I knit, but am not the greatest teacher, so this DVD is a great way to teach the kids in my life how to knit.
The animated knitting fable is also great and once you learn, you can make the knitted ball project on the DVD.
Summer's coming, so it's a great time to give kids a fun activity to do.
You'll love this DVD!",1178064000,17,498,3.9405940594059405

8191296,5,B000PGTF2I,"Ryan, the 7 year old boy that gives beginning knitting instructions on this CD is amazing!  I sent this to a 3rd grader who wants to learn to knit -- haven't heard from her yet.  I want to learn to crochet, so I sent for the Crochet CD and Ryan does the instructions for that, too.  I will tackle that after the new year!",1388275200,,321,3.984375
8191297,5,B000PGTF2I,It showed me what to do.  Very Good. Seeing the work being done is great. I have suggested it to others.,1377907200,,104,3.9523809523809526
8191298,5,B000PGTF2I,"I bought this DVD and had it sent to my granddaughter who is a first grader. She needed to learn to knit for a class project and was having some issues with it. Her parents did not know anyone there who knits, and I could not go to her to help her, The day they received my son called and said that the whole family was enjoying this DVD... It made it fun to learn and easy... My son said, he might even give it a try... I felt so much better being able to help her, even if I couldn't in person. THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!  I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to knit, or just needs a refresher. I plan on watching it myself for tips...",1368576000,,646,3.857142857142857
8191299,5,B000PGTF2I,"My 6 year old daughter has been nagging me for a while to learn to knit.  I searched on Amazon, found this dvd and lion brand's 10 inch knitting needles for kids, and I decided to buy them for her.  She can now cast on, and knit.  :)
This is a great dvd.",1363046400,,254,3.7547169811320753
8191300,5,B000PGTF2I,Cuteness Alert! I got this learn to knit video for my student knitting club. It is taught by a 7-year-old boy. He teaches knitting much better than I do. It kind of reminds me of how I learned Spanish from little kids when I was studying abroad in Costa Rica because they had so much more patience with me when I didn't understand. I would recommend it for kids and adults.,1357516800,,373,4.267605633802817
8191301,5,B000PGTF2I,Awesome gift and fun to teach them to learn about knitting. Great to teach them young so they can be super knitters later on in life!,1350345600,,133,4.153846153846154
8191302,4,B000PGTF2I,I used this video to teach a group of 6th grade students to knit.  The effect was instant.  In two sessions I had 5 kids doing both knit and purl stitches.  The lessons are taught by a young boy and the technique is crystal clear!  Highly recommend!,1326758400,2,249,4.23404255319149
8191303,5,B000PGTF2I,"My girls like to watch this video, even if they are not trying to knit.  It is quite instructional and strangely soothing.",1326067200,,122,4.545454545454546
8191304,5,B000PGTF2I,My daughters really wanted to learn knitting because of their grandma. I looked all over the web to see what the best beginner dvd was and this sure enough was right on the money. My girls picked up knitting techniques instantly and had so much fun doing it! It's great watching them knit with their grandmother. My wife's even picking it up to! I highly recommend The Art of Knitting for Kids DVD!,1312761600,,398,4.465753424657534
