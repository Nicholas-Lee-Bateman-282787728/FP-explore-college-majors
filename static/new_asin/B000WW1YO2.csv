8225888,3,B000WW1YO2,The episodes contained in the 5th season flew a little off course from the original manga. They had disappointing endings and were easily forgotten. It did contain a few episodes that stuck to its roots. Those are the ones that keep this season from being a total flop.,1360022400,,269,4.625
8225889,5,B000WW1YO2,"This show is a classic. It is amazing, and it is well worth the watch. You will love the characters, you won't be able to not. It's one of the shows that will sneak into your heart and make itself at home.",1359849600,,205,3.9047619047619047
8225890,5,B000WW1YO2,I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift. I was concerned because it was used. However when they said very good condition they were right. We have had no problems at all with the dvds and my husband is enjoying watching them.,1325635200,,232,4.295454545454546

In season five the madness continues as Ranma and Akane's relationship develops and progresses. Of course, it never goes full circle. The animation is still a bit on the sloppy side, but to its credits the animators have adapted the character design of the OAV series. So Ranma is drawn a bit more on the beautiful side so to speak.

This is such a great series to watch if you wanna relax and enjoy a good laugh. Its a must have for all Ranma fans.",1262390400,,911,6.720338983050848
8225893,5,B000WW1YO2,As long as you don't expect plot and great story you will find yourself enjoying the Ranma 1/2 series.  I find myself watching them when I just want to relax and smile.  It is an easy series to sit down and watch an episode or two.,1252800000,,231,4.0
8225894,3,B000WW1YO2,"Ranma 1/2 Martial Mayhem is a DVD box set of the fifth season of Ranma 1/2.  This set contains a total of twenty-four episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains four episodes and the special features.

The special features menu contains five options: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" and ""Actor Profiles.""  As expected, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  The line art gallery contains model sketches of the characters that appear in this DVD box set.  However, I don't know how many pages of sketches there are, because no page numbers were included in this feature (which had been the case for the previous Ranma 1/2 DVD box sets).  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.  It should be noted that, unlike some of the previous box sets, that the English names that appear in the cast list are not links to their entries in the ""Actor Profiles"" area.  In my opinion, I thought that Viz Media was putting less effort into the DVD extras in this set than they had on the previous DVD box sets.

Ranma 1/2 Martial Mayhem is a rather ""low frills"" DVD set.  While the special features are better than what appeared on the first Ranma 1/2 DVD box set, I wish something had been done that took a little more effort, such as interviews with the English voice actors, or character profiles for the characters that appear on the box set.

Ranma 1/2 Martial Mayhem tends to run between $40 and $50 at retail.  While this could be considered a little high-priced for what you get, the episodes are still worth the cost.  The series is very enjoyable for an older audience (16 and up), and really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",1244505600,,1886,4.672727272727273
8225895,5,B000WW1YO2,"It is very interesting about this season 5 Ranma 1/2. The series has been improving in story, character designs from one season to the next season. Needless to say, the story is hilarious. The character's action, gesture, speech are the icons of Takabashi Rumiko sen sei's animation. From Urusei Yatsura in the 80's to some latest works, her skills are praised and even imitated by other creators.",1204502400,2,397,4.940298507462686
