The soundtrack made me wanna jam a pencil in my ear. The plot moved at a snail's pace, and the characters were undeveloped and completely devoid of any true emotion. Plus we never really found out what the big tragedy was that had the cast spiraling down. We know a friend died, but not how. The most riveting scene was......never mind, there wasn't one. The presence of the lovely Dominique Swain couldn't even bring me to feign some interest in this bore. The lead character smoked cigarette after cigarette and never did or said anything of consequence. Not worth a penny.",1294704000,2,726,4.592307692307692
