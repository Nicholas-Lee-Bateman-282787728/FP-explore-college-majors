8400299,5,B002XVESTS,"Personally I love this item, is one of my most treasured posessions, I remembre when this concert took place, I live nera San Diego and a radio station played the concert live, I stayed up all night listening, all or at least most of my favorite bands were there, Skid Row, Cinderella, Ozzy, Mtley Cre, Scorpion's, Bon Jovi. this is a must have if you love this kind of music. As a surprise for me, my 10 year old can't stop playing it and has inspired him to play music so I am holding on to this one. I bought it used, but it was in great condition.",1355961600,,551,4.111111111111111
