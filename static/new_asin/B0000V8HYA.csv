8003563,5,B0000V8HYA,"If you are looking for a DVD that will ""turn your TV into an aquarium"" this is the DVD you want.  There are salt water aquariums, under sea footage, ocean waves footage, rain, sunsets, bubbles or something like ink dropped into water. Plus you can choose between playing the sound effects or music.  Choosing random plays random (of course) scenes with random sound effects or music.  The DVD cover says 16 scenes and 8 audio tracks and they are all beautiful.

And you can choose to play your particular scenes once through or continously.

Some real thinking was put into the making of this DVD, and i am very glad i bought it.",1096588800,8,629,4.530973451327434
