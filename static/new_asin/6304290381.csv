8454099,5,6304290381,"This series of videos does an excellent job of bringing Jane Hissey's characters to life.  We first checked out the books and videos from our local library and soon found that we could not live without them.  My daughter is almost five and still adores these tapes.  Old Bear is a grandfatherly figure, very calm and matter of fact about things; Little Bear is the energetic guy your kids will relate to.  The whole cast of characters is adorable, and the stories teach kids how to handle problems and setbacks with humor and a can-do attitude--a very British flavor, I believe.  5 Stars for sure.",1107734400,,597,4.647619047619048
