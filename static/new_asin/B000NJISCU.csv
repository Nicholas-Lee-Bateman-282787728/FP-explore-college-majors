8178263,4,B000NJISCU,"This was the first foreign language film (Russian) that I saw when in my teens, and it turned me on to foreign language films as a genre for the next 55 years.",1358812800,4,159,4.0
8178264,5,B000NJISCU,"It's a shame that this isn't generally available, but you can probably get it on ebay or through a Russian-specific provider like Ruscico or russiandvd.com. I'm not qualified to judge the quality of the translation in the English subtitles; they seem comprehensive to me. (Subtitles are also available in French, German, Spanish, and Italian.) The print quality is excellent, that's for sure, and the film is a marvel to look at. The director, Grigory Chukhrai, is generally credited with one of the Soviet cinema's classics of the Thaw with his 1959 masterpiece ""Ballad of a Soldier."" While it would be difficult to overrate ""Ballad,"" this film came three years earlier and does not receive proper credit for breaking with the traditions of Socialist Realism (up to a point, anyway, but ""Ballad"" also broke with those traditions only to a point).

""The Forty First"" tells the story of an expert markswoman during the Russian Civil War. When she finds herself falling in love with a prisoner who is her potential 41st victim (thus the title), she is drawn into a moral dilemma that leads to a heart-rending ending. The film won a well-deserved Special Jury Prize at Cannes in 1957, and its cinematography must be seen to be believed. If you are a fan of Russian/Soviet cinema, this is absolutely worth tracking down.",1292457600,11,1316,4.927927927927928
8178265,4,B000NJISCU,"This old Soviet movie by G. Chukhray (the screen version of now unjustly forgotten Boris Lavrenev's talented novel ""The 41st"") is still sending message to us: what is stronger - love and a dream about an ideal partner (""and they lived happily ever after"") or anti-human socialist ideology artificially planted in a young girl's head. This newly created product of Socialist ideas she passionately believed in, this Civil War times ""Juliet"" does not have a choice except adding one more victim to her long list of already eliminated enemies.",1283644800,3,540,5.078651685393258
8178266,5,B000NJISCU,"I just got this DVD from RussianDVD.com. The release has been held up for two years for some production problems, but the wait was worth it. This DVD is just gorgeous. I first saw the film in the 60s, and if memory does not fail me, the color  was never this lush and wonderful.

This film, I believe, is Chukhraj's second best; the very best one, hands down, is ""The Ballad of a Soldier"". The same cinematographer was responsible for the remarkable cinematography  (color in FF and B/W in BoaS) of both films.

Both films share something in common: a very simple (but not simplistic) plot and a poetic treatment, which are also the main characteristics of Boris Lavrenev's original novella, which ""The Forty First"" is based on.

The ending is a sad one, so you may want to watch it when you're in the right mindset.

By the way, in the book the heroine is described as having green-yellowish, cat-like eyes, an image that has stuck in my mind since I read an English translation of it long time ago.",1138924800,5,1000,4.497237569060774
