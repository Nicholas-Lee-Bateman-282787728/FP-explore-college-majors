7795961,5,1558906428,"Anne of Green Gables is an excellent family movie. It is an actual G rated movie, very hard to find nowadays. It has everything- romance, comedy, drama, and suspence. Anne is a very imaginative girl who overdramatizes everything. I could go on, but you really should just buy the movie and see it for yourself. You'll be glad you did.",1268092800,2,334,4.583333333333333
7795962,5,1558906428,"Anne of Green Gables was actually shown on TV as several segments. It is an absolutely wonderful family movie.  My husband, daughter and sons all loved it and we have watched it many times. Because of being several segments, it is longer than the average movie, but it is easy to sit and watch the whole thing in one sitting.  A movie about an orphan and how her life changes.  I can't say enough about how much we love it.",1209686400,,423,4.2625
