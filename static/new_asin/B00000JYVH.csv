1239260,5,B00000JYVH,"Thank you Tom Laughlin for releasing these four movies.  Saw Billy Jack and The Trial of Billy Jack when they first came out.  He brought out exactly what my thoughts are on the same issues. Hope there is another  Billy Jack movie to come? A must see to all how saw them then.  Again, a  must see now.  The same ideas could be said today.",954028800,9,338,4.123076923076923
1239261,4,B00000JYVH,"In December of 1999, I received a phone call from Mr. Tom Laughlin.  It was an honor to talk to Mr. Laughlin and discover what he has been doing the last several years. The 4-tape set ""The Billy Jack  Collection"", is a must for fans of this 70's saga of the Native  American/Veteran/Seeker of justice and his trials.  ""Born Losers""  set box office records in its day for that genre.  ""Billy Jack""  is legendary, and so is the fight the Laughlins had with studio execs to be  sure it was released to mainstream America.  The ""Trial of Billy  Jack"" reminds the viewer of the societal issues during the Vietnam and  post-Vietnam era.  ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" was never  released, or had very limited release and it is said that certain members  of the U.S. Congress wanted to be sure it was never seen.  For those of us  (me included) who grew up in the 70's, ""Billy Jack"" lives in us  forever.  This set is a must for Billy Jack fans.  Also.... check out the  Billy Jack website.  It's worth a look.",952300800,24,1005,4.412087912087912
1239262,4,B00000JYVH,"It's great to see these movies available again! I saw these when I was a kid & it left a hell of an impression on me to this day. The saga starts with ""The Born Losers"". Billy Jack (Tom Laughlin) is a  loner who keeps to himself & helps a girl being harrassed by a  motorcycle gang. Good action movie. This helped create the 2nd movie,  ""Billy Jack"". It was made by a group of student/independent film  makers, & Laughlin. It became a huge hit & had a cult following,  the 3rd installment, ""Trial of Billy Jack"", picked up right where  ""Billy Jack""left off. Although a bit lengthy, (3 hours) it was an  amazing movie. Filled with political injustices & prejudices of a town  against an alternative school & the hero. The 4th movie, is almost  autobiographical, as Laughlin ran for a spot in congress in real life. The  movies are all about loving & treating everyone the way you want to be  treated, with an avenging angel making sure corrupt police, politicians,  & townsfolk, do just that. I loved it! Delores Taylor, who plays the  controversial school ""principal""& founder, is Laughlins real  life wife. These movies all share a common theme of peace through strength,  Billy Jack hates to fight & only does so when provoked or if he sees  the innocent threatened.",945129600,11,1268,4.59375

7913827,2,B00000JYVH,"Billy Jack, 1971 film

This film opens with a police car driving out of town. Sheriff Cole gets a message from the most powerful man in town. Riders are rounding up wild mustangs to harvest for dog food. [Mustangs eat the scarce fodder needed by cattle.] Mr. Posner wants his son to fire the first shot, but he refuses. [This is done for effect, Bernards true character is shown later.] Billy Jack rides up to order them off the Indian Reservation. The wild horses are released to freedom. [Symbolism?] A Deputy Sheriff has a runaway daughter who is returned from Haight-Ashbury with an abscessed tooth, hepatitis, and pregnancy. [Lack of a mothers care?] The school at the Reservation is different, there are three rules. [Do the inmates run this asylum?] Are they getting the education and experience to prepare them for their future in Civilization? What will happen to them in twenty years?

Are there too many stereotyped or cartoon characters? Bernard Posner says hello but is rebuffed. There is a needless conflict in the ice cream parlor. Billy Jack really tries to stay calm. There is a confrontation in the town square. The Sheriff breaks it up. There is a search for the missing runaway Barbara. Those damned kids won't listen. [Their education from television?] The town council wants to ban the students from the reservation from coming into town. [A loss of business?] An eleven-year old girl reads a speech: who said that? [Who put that idea into her mind?] Is this another conflict between generations or cultures? [Does this scene run on too long?] The town people visit the school to watch their skits. Are they still funny? Tedious? Do Stone-Age customs have any relevance to the Atomic Age? Its just acts for entertainment, speeches that sound pretentious.

Back in town some seem to walk into a trap. [Note the familiarity with guns.] Does the story go downhill from here? Is that play-acting credible? Or just padding to fill out the film? Billy Jack shows up to rescue a maiden from the danger she put herself into. [After the opening scene, why would he reward his son?] I really wish you would. Did that new car need a wash? Will Bernard and his buddy commit a felony? [Another deliberately shocking scene?] One student is kidnapped as a hostage. Will he escape? An ambulance is summoned.

The Sheriff has search warrants to find runaway Barbara. Mike shoots at Billy Jack, who returns one shot. [More shocking scenes?] There is a final stand-off with dramatic shooting. [Like some old western film.] Can Billy Jack get a fair trial because the whole world is watching? Thats a bunch of crap! A deal is made so Billy Jack surrenders. [The movie wouldnt work without this.] What happens next?

The National Student Film Corporation is listed as the producer. Who exactly is that? What happened to the actors later? The dramatic scenes that shocked the audience resulted in its success. The political issues are shown as facts that are not resolved. Will the townspeople still dislike the students? [Yes, but things will change with time.] While still dramatic, this film seems quite dated today. I like this much more when it first appeared.",1430784000,,3165,4.842883548983364
7913828,5,B00000JYVH,"Corny, misrepresents Natives, but still much loved in NDN Country.  The films got longer, preachier, and more boring as they went along.  Tom Laughlin sent me a friend request on FB, but I ended up unfriending him. He got even more 'out there' as his age progressed.  May he rest in peace.",1426464000,,289,4.519230769230769
7913829,4,B00000JYVH,"I first saw the Jack movies in the actual theater, not VHS.  I was a kid, and my brothers and dad were soldiers during Viet Nam.  I love the first 3 of the series.  They showed a little what it was like to be an Indian in ""society"".  As a New Mexico resident, I lived near the reservations, and picked up hitchhikers to/from there.  A mentor of mine, Jim DePew, reminded me of Billy Jack.  When I was invited to join the Army, I had to be the best, and was sent to the Special Forces A Team as a Green Beret medic.  I studied warfare, medicine,and civilization, and learned to be at peace, much like I saw in Billy Jack.  The first 3 videos reminded me of those days .... and it was nice to revisit them.  As far as the 4th movie ""Billy Jack Goes To Washington"" ....  well it was ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" with James Stewart ... it was remake, and I give it 2 stars or less (the original with Stewart was much better 5 stars).

Overall, the series is a classic and worthy of any video collection ......  even with the last of the four being dissappointing.",1126828800,,1061,4.147058823529412
7913830,5,B00000JYVH,"If you like anything in the Billy Jack series then this is a must have set.  I could relate to these movies so much, they truly show what people who were different from others actually went through.  It shows what true love and friendship really is, and that it is truly worth fighting for.  Tom Laughin plays the best Billy Jack ever and every other actor/actress fits in each part perfectly.  I know you will enjoy this set or any of the Billy Jack movies.",1105228800,4,458,4.352941176470588
7913831,3,B00000JYVH,"If you saw the Billy Jack movies when you were young, as I did, you probably missed all the things it was trying to say about political issues, and went for the karate that looked cool back then. Then you grew up watching Chuck Noris, Jean Claude Van Dam,and Steven Segal.  Now you can go back and see how few fight scenes there were in these movies and how hokey they looked.  I like all these movies because of what the remind me of.  I understand what they were trying to say.  If you're a Billy Jack fan you know who you are, then these are your movies.  I'm torn between liking these movies for what they meant to me years ago, and criticizing them for being so long and drawn out.  There is one movie in the set that I had never seen called ""Billy Jack Goes To Washington"".  This one is so un-Billy Jack as you can get, only one fight scene.  But then again that's not really what these movies were about, is it?",1044144000,2,918,4.146892655367232
7913832,4,B00000JYVH,"Hello,  i was fresh from the jungles of vietNam, in 73.  I was one of the disallusioned that felt abandoned and unwanted by my government and its citizens.  I saw this movie many times then and now, whenever I begin to feel depressed or when I do not feel i make much difference. there are some that trash this and his other movies for violence to promote pacifism.  Or that violence is the answer to violence.  I never saw it as that...I saw it a 1 man's decision to attempt to stop the violence.  he stood up to it..stopped it.. but when it escelated.. he was forced to meet violence with violence. this movie made me decide not to run and hide, but to stand and say ""NO MORE"" to hatred, bigotry, racism.  I realized thru these movies, that one man standing up ""for that which is right, not the popular"", can make a difference.  One person at a time! thank you for these movies Tom and Delores Laughlin.  I wish I could say this to you in person.... I owe you alot.... cliff Richardson  ptsop39@juno.com",976838400,12,1005,4.354838709677419
7913833,5,B00000JYVH,"What can I say?  BILLY JACK, in spite of the misunderstading of critics and some of the public, is as relevant today as when these movies were originally released. TOM LAUGHLIN understands more that anybody about the  conscience (and unconscience) of people than most psychiatrists and  psychologists of today. These movies tackles hard-hitting issues with  delicate care on how one might resolve them. There is never a condolence of  violence; on the contrary, it is used only when no other method is  available.  All these movies are great, but especially BILLY JACK GOES TO  WASHINGTON needs to be seen.  It's like reading todays's headlines from  Washington.  Kudos to you, Tom.",958176000,17,682,5.109090909090909
