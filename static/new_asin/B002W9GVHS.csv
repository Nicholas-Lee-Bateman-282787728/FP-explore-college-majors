4006343,2,B002W9GVHS,"I have other dance workout dvds that I enjoy, but this was my first (and probably last) experience with Petra.  She is pleasant and she cues the moves just fine, but she doesn't teach them at all.  She refers to moves from her other dvds as if everyone watching must already be familiar with them.  Very frustrating for a first time viewer.  The moves themselves are okay, nothing extra special, though the music is pretty good.  I'll probably give it another few tries to see whether I can grasp any more of it.  For those who haven't tried Petra before, I highly recommend instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-with-Julianne-Cardio-Ballroom/dp/B002LSI1GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance with Julianne: Cardio Ballroom</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-off-the-Inches-Dance-It-off-Ballroom/dp/B001F12ITO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance off the Inches: Dance It off Ballroom</a>, or even the one I started out with,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Cardio-Dance-Blast/dp/B000A3XY82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Cardio Dance Blast</a>&nbsp;(cheesy but fun).",1288051200,,1212,7.746376811594203
4006344,5,B002W9GVHS,"I love this video because it's NOT just dance ... you actually get a good workout in too. To put things in context, I waver between intermediate and advanced in my cardio ability.  I love variety - I do kickboxing, step, hip hop and boot camp type workouts. And I also mix the level of the workouts because on days when I don't feel like working out, I think it is better to do something lighter than nothing at all.  That is where this DVD fits in - it is fun and easy to learn but not completely un-challenging. After the workout I don't feel very taxed but I also don't feel I've wasted my workout time. And Petra's a gem too - clear, pleasant, a little bit of a sense of humour without seeming like she's trying too hard. It's worth noting though that this DVD does not have any shorter 'pre-mixes'. I workout in the morning and on days when I over-sleep, it's nice to have a complete 20 or 30-minute workout. This is not a huge problem for me anymore because I've been exercising at home for a while and I now have quite a few shorter ones I can choose from but I thought I should mention it, because in the beginning this used to be a very important consideration for me.",1284768000,,1177,4.20353982300885
4006345,3,B002W9GVHS,"Having enjoyed a Reebok step video she did years ago, I was excited to get this workout DVD.  I'm a bit disappointed.  Having danced for 13 years I found some of it difficult to follow the first few go 'rounds and when all was said and done, I can get a harder (more sweaty) workout in less time other places.  Too bad I can't get the Reebok workout on DVD...that was a goody.",1282694400,,376,4.123287671232877
4006346,5,B002W9GVHS,"I've had this DVD for about a month because I participated in the pre-sale offered by Petra Kolber's webiste.  This DVD is a lot of fun, and it's my new favorite workout.  There are 6 dance combinations that incorporate a lot of different moves.  At the end of learning the routines, you ""take it from the top"" 2 times in a row.  There is a warm up at the beginning and a dancer's stretch at the end.  The music selection is great and Petra cues consistently well.  Petra has great energy.  I really enjoy the moves in this DVD. If you're familiar with Petra's other dance DVDs, you will find this DVD easy.  A warning for those of you who are not coordinated- this DVD doesn't have a lot of instruction.  Petra will demonstrate a move a few times, but pretty much just jumps right in.  If you like a lot of instruction, you may not enjoy this DVD.  I have most of Petra's other DVDs and I'm familiar with the moves she likes to use (mambas, box steps, rock steps, cha-cha-chas, and the Elvis), so I caught on pretty quickly.  Whenever there is a turn, it's always optional.  Petra demonstrates the easy version of the move and her back up dancers demonstrate the turns.  I would recommend this DVD for intermediate to advanced exercisers who like choreography.  That's only because I feel a beginner would get frustrated if she couldn't learn the moves right away.  I highly recommend Petra Kolber and her other workouts: Cardio for Beginners, Boot Camp Boogie, and 3, 2, 1, Dance.",1259884800,22,1482,4.515037593984962
8382905,5,B002W9GVHS,"A few weeks ago I bought the Cardio for Beginners with Petra Kolber.  I just wanted a change from my Jane Fonda Prime work outs.  I love Jane's routine because I can do them and they are fun and low impact.  I can do all of the Petra Cardio for Beginners routines after one week of practice.  I was thrilled with that.  It's so fun.  I am 67 years old.  I need a low impact easy routine with lots of help to get me through the moves. I bought the Just Dance & Get Fit because I loved the Cardio DVD.  It is GREAT.  I can't do all of the routines. I guess I need more practice.  Routine number 1 and number 6 are perfect for me and I can do them perfectly.  They are fun, the music is GREAT, the instruction is PERFECT.  It's really got me going in this New Year!  I meet my Fitbit goals everyday now:  30 minutes of aerobic heart level activity.  I wholeheartily recommend Just Dance & Get Fit. The younger ones might be able to do the Elvis move (number 2).  I am still working on that one. ;)",1484524800,,994,3.9948979591836733
8382906,3,B002W9GVHS,"I loved Petra's workouts and loved all of them that I have tried...until now. It is not that this is a bad workout...it even looked fun. However, I am not a dancer. These routines went to fast and did not give enough time to learn the steps as they were strung together. this was not doable for me and although it looked fun if I had been able to do it, this was not fun for me.",1474588800,,378,3.9220779220779223

8382909,5,B002W9GVHS,"Excellent, fun, easy to follow steps ( as long as you have some familiarity with basic dances such as cha cha). It is now one of my favorite work out DVDs.",1406419200,,155,4.032258064516129
8382910,5,B002W9GVHS,Petra's dance moves are fun - just complicated enough to make the workout interesting. The music she chooses is also first-rate - much better than the generic music used in most exercise dvds.,1379980800,,192,4.848484848484849
8382911,1,B002W9GVHS,"I have been doing work-out DVD's for many years and was very excited about this video, but after I did it, I was really disappointed. I love complex choreography, but this was over the top. She is extremely hard to follow, her cuing is horrible. The dance moves are not cardio at all, this work-out will not raise your heart rate or make you sweat or out of breath, 3 things that I absolutely expect when I work out. I think walk away the pounds would give a better workout than this. And the moves are just mundane and boring, don't waste your money on this one!!",1375315200,2,564,4.280373831775701

When I fist got ""Just Dance"" I watched the dance blocks and was sure I would fall all over myself as I am ""choreography challenged"". BUT: After about 2 weeks or so I GOT IT. And I love this video! Petra's given me the confidence to move on to more advanced dance workouts.",1369440000,,505,6.027777777777778
8382913,5,B002W9GVHS,"I've got quite a video library, and Petra is easily one of my favorites, if not my #1 choice. She's got great cuing, fun moves that take a little time to learn, but really flow with fun rhythms and positions, once you get them down after a couple of viewings. The sets look nice and shouldn't date easily and the production quality is good.

As a Boomer, I appreciate working out with someone who's not that far behind me in age and reminds me how terrific we really can look.",1334620800,,476,4.288888888888889
8382914,4,B002W9GVHS,I am not too good at dancing but I picked up on the steps pretty quickly.  Its a fun workout for days when you do not want to push yourself too hard.,1297987200,,149,3.65625
