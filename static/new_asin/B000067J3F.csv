7963276,5,B000067J3F,This guy is crazy. Why can't I find anymore material on him. He should be tearing up the circuit. Instead we have all these new jacks who don't really know how to be funny. More Don D C ... More Don D C,1391558400,,202,3.7209302325581395
7963277,3,B000067J3F,"I thought the video was average except for
Don (DC) Curry. He had me laughing during
his whole monologue.  I thought The late
great Richard Pryor was funny but he takes
second place to DC. The other comics were
average at best.",1388188800,,227,4.404761904761905
7963278,5,B000067J3F,This DVD is really funny. It's soo good to see and hear these comics before their careers took off they are all so funny from the beginning up to now.,1378080000,2,150,4.033333333333333
7963279,5,B000067J3F,"Wish they had more of Don DC Curry! The other artists are funny as well, some are younger shots of current/recent successful comedians, but other than that I would rate it a 8.5. Definitely worth a look!",1348444800,3,203,4.513513513513513
