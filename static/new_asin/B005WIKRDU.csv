8487920,1,B005WIKRDU,"I've watched Virginia Creepers over and over and have loved it.  I purchased The Bowman Body in hopes that I could continue to learn more about the VA horror host genre.

The one star is not indicative of the material on the disc....I couldn't play the damned thing.  It would not load up in either of my computers (checked, set to region 1) and I haven't been able to play it in my dvd player.  Highly disappointed, since I loved Bowman's section on VA Creepers.",1416614400,,463,4.411764705882353
