8394016,3,B003BVWSL4,"Not bad, but in general more a touristic commercial than a profound documentary",1415318400,2,79,5.153846153846154
8394017,3,B003BVWSL4,"DVD was nice and had some magnificent video of Schloss Neuschwanstein.  The English language was dubbed over German, but the German wasn't eliminated completely from the sound, so it was a little annoying to listen to.  This DVD wasn't just about the Schloss, but the area around it and history associated with it.  I would have rated it higher had it had more video of the exterior/interior close ups of Schloss Neuschwanstein.  For the price is it a nice DVD though.",1359331200,6,468,4.7407407407407405
