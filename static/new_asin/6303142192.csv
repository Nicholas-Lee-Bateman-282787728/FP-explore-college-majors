7838994,3,6303142192,"***some spoilers herein*** This TV movie about the Menendez murders is not as well-acted as the other version released the same year, ""Menendez: A Killing In Beverly Hills"" but presents many of the details of the case more accurately. James Farentino does very well in the role of Jose Menendez but the other actors don't come off as well. The film does however, give the viewer more than pause to consider what might have happened that led to the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez by their two sons, Lyle and Erik.

There is one scene that is disturbing in retrospect, when Jose is trying to persuade his son Erik into a sexual act with him and when the son refuses he gets slapped, comforted and told, ""get back on the bed"". Not graphic, but still chilling. As for the truth, who knows.",1478131200,,789,4.5174825174825175
7838995,5,6303142192,"This really is a superb portrayal of an awful event by these two boys, Eric & Lyle Menendez.  My wife and I have actually watched this movie a couple of times and each time is like the first.  We can't take our eyes off of the screen.  It's so sad to see how low the human mind can sink when it becomes engrossed in greed and selfishness.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone even remotely interested in this case.",1290124800,2,424,4.197530864197531
