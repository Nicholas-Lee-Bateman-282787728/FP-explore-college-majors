Well when Bruce decided he was going to do the movie Path of the Dragon he asked Chuck Norris to be in the film on 1 condition when the fight seen with Bruce Lee & Chuck Norris in the movie it would be ( REAL) Yes REAL. So when you hear Chuck Norris's leg break in the movie it really was broke by Bruce Lee. And after that a beautiful Lifelong friendship was developed with Chuck & Bruce. See this movie!!!!! And Bruce or Chuck fan will love it.",1406505600,,613,4.074380165289257
