8693803,3,B00R244FAI,"This features two docs. The first is a 1970's doc about pet cemeteries, the people who take their pets the, and the people who service the cemeteries. Some insight, some ramble on at times. Occasional insight.

The second doc is about a 1980's small town where mostly guys just ramble on about what comes to their minds. Some spirituality mentioned, other than that watching will be time you never get back.",1518393600,,407,4.732394366197183
8693804,4,B00R244FAI,"Blend Charles Kurault's travels to small-town America, Studs Terkel's talent for empathetic interview, and a dash of David Lynch's off-kilter point of view, and you have Errol Morris: documentarian nonpareil. I don't agree with Siskel and Ebert that either ""Gates of Heaven"" or ""Vernon, Florida"" is a Great Moviean accolade I apply sparingly. I do believe that these are excellent documentaries that take us and places and introduce us to people most of us might not meet, or think we'd want to meet. The irony is that, as oddball as some of Morris's subjects may seem, they are our kin. Because of that, after seeing these films, we've learned something about ourselves and human being. Kudos to Criterion for giving these early Morris ventures the first-class treatment they deserve. To buy or not to buy? My suggestion: rent one on Amazon, view it, then decide if you enjoyed it enough for repeat viewings.",1511481600,,909,4.947712418300654

8693807,4,B00R244FAI,"After reading about the film, Gates of Heaven, I wanted to watch it.  This film was not what I expected.  I thought it would just be about the people and stories about their pets.  I also watched Vernon, Florida.  Both films gave insight to worldviews of others in another time.  Disturbing elements were also discussed: the rendering plant person's story of elephant remains treatment and killing turkeys.

Errol Morris was very thorough and spliced together the interviews with great skill.  I viewed the bonus material except the one about Herzog eating a shoe which I did not see a listing for anyway. Morris explained that he did not interrupt people he was filming.  I was impressed that he let people have space & tell their stories.  Between the two films, I preferred Vernon, Florida, I think.",1471132800,,802,4.838235294117647

8693811,5,B00R244FAI,"BEWARE OF meeting your heroes. Director Douglas Sirk (All that Heaven Allows, 1955; Imitation of Life, 1959) walked out midway through Bill Morris debut documentary, Gates of Heaven, at the Berlin Film Festival. This isn't a movie, this is a slide show, Sirk said.

Then he said something very, very weird, Morris tells us, describing the unfortunate interaction with one of his favorite filmmakers. This comes from one of the truly ironic Hollywood directors. He said theres a danger somebody might find this movie to be ironic ... as if I should be cautioned.

Well, thats possible, especially in todays cynical climate. The story about the closing and relocation of a pet cemetery outside of San Francisco sets itself up for satire, even if there is no wailing or emotional diatribes  just plain folks telling their stories. There is no score or narration to prep us either. Morris uses a method he calls Interrotron in which subjects talk to the camera. It is as if they are speaking to us directly, a technique now used frequently, but was unique at the time. One mans quest to create a final resting place for pets is combined with stories from pet owners and a man who owns a rendering plant, where dead animals are processed into products from food to fuel. The plant manager cant make sense of those who become emotionally attached to animals. The cemetery director has no head for business; he gets his land on the strength of a handshake, and is betrayed when it is reclaimed. Morris was inspired to make his film following a story about how the cemetery was dissolved, the animals excavated, and moved to another pet memorial property outside of Napa.

Yes, some of it brings a smile, a headshake. Then the old gentleman tells us about a familys memorial service for their cat: Here before us lies little Toby. Little Toby was put on this earth for two reasons: To love and to be loved. And today, were standing here saying good-bye to little Toby who was the Smiths beloved little friend. Now we are going to give you back, little Toby, to Mother Nature.

Theres not a dry eye in the room.

The second documentary in Criterions presentation is equally odd  and oddly captivating. Vernon, Florida, was initially called Nub City. In another new, 2014 interview on Criterions restoration, Morris tells us how he learned about a town where residents would shoot off an arm or leg  sometimes both  for the insurance. Not a nice place. And when Morris ventured into the area  despite warnings  he was beat up and run out of town.

He didn't give up. Returning a few years later, he uses his Interrotron technique on four-limbed citizens who, frankly, define the word eccentric. One who hunts turkeys waxes poetic about the thrill of the kill; the hunt itself cures diarrhea, he says. Another elderly gent rescues/captures wild animals; some seem to be pets, others  its hard to say exactly whats going on there. A UFO spotter rhapsodizes about using tar and feathers to keep folks in line. They should run them out of town on a rail, tar and feathers  Well, hed have something to think about wouldn't he? Next time, well give you the hot seat, buddy.

How the hell did we leap into that tirade? Its a relief to find the local trooper, who talks about parking his patrol car in plain sight to give truckers a chance to slow down before he has to give them a speeding ticket. Then we learn the mans been shot at regardless of his consideration.

What a wonderful slice of Americana.

Morris himself fascinates as he talks about his films. Gates of Heaven debuted during a newspaper strike; it owes its success to the great PR he got from TV critics Robert Ebert and Gene Siskel, who tried to top one another talking about how much they loved it. He also tells us how he battled through several film crews to make Gates. His first cameraman wouldn't film the movie the way Morris directed; he was fired, but not before Morris pitched him into an open grave, arguing over techniques. (Its not easy being a maverick.)

Criterions 1080p transfers are presented in their original screen aspect ratio of 1:33:1 and 1.66.1, with surrounding black bars. Film grain is very heavy, yet colors are natural and images strong; depth is good. Some dirt and scratches remain, but thats to be expected on these low budget productions. A complete digital wash might have reduced visuals to plastic and that would be a crime.

The mono soundtracks were remastered at 24-bit from the 35mm tracks. Interviews come through cleanly with natural background noise; clicks and pops have been removed. This is certainly the best the films have looked and sounded since their original release. Maybe even better.

Youll find a fold-out essay by Eric Hynes, who perfectly describes Morris films as excursions in a minor key among the bonus features. As noted, both films have new interviews with Morris recorded in 2014, and are definitely worth watching. So is Werner Herzog Eats his Shoe, a 21-minute film made in 1980, where the director prepares and eats said-shoe, fulfilling a bet he made about Morris completing his first feature film.

Nice to know the weird factor isn't limited to Americans.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,8,5193,4.75194660734149
8693812,5,B00R244FAI,"This is Errol Morris early in his career and he is just wonderful doing these early documentaries. GATES OF HEAVEN is one of the best movies ever made much less best documentary. It is about people who are pet lovers and the experience of using pet cemeteries for their beloved pets. The movie is the people talking about their pets. There are not pet bodies or burials. As a long time dog lover who has lost her fair share of beloved pets, this really hit home with me. But if you don't believe me, the year it came out, both Siskel and Ebert named it the best movie of that year.

Vernon Florida is also quite good where you get to see a Florida that the average tourist does not. If like me you have gone to Florida to experience the water on either the Gulf or Atlantic side, along with the beautiful beaches, this is not about that. As just one example, an obsessive turkey hunter speaks glowingly of the ""gobblers"" he tracks and kills in that rural Florida which none of us see. A preacher expounds upon a single word in his sermon. The word: ""Therefore."" This is about a sleepy little southern town which is a way we never even think about Florida.

No one does people better than Errol Morris does.
