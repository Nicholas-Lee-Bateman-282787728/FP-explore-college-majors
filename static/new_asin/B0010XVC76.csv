8239308,5,B0010XVC76,This is my first kettle bell workout DVD. I love it and look forward to adding more DVDs from Paul Katami!! He gives clear instructions for the beginner. All the drill are demonstrated by Paul and 2 others -- one shows the advanced way to do an exercise and the other shows the beginner way. The workouts burn a lot of calories without being intimidating.,1328832000,,355,4.476923076923077
8239309,5,B0010XVC76,"I have done this dvd a number of times, and it can be easily modified up or down.  The form and explanation provided is flawless.  Also, the exercises themselves are laid out in an interesting fashion. You work the entire body.  The work segments are timed so you can work at your own pace which will depend on skill and weight chosen.  Paul Katami provides clear instruction and you can see how much he loves doing his job.  I have other kettlebell dvds by Katami and am very happy with them too.  I would say that this would be a good dvd for people who are in decent shape and want to learn how to use a kettlebell.  You can use a section here and there or mix it up for a longer workout.  You can continue to use these workouts as you get more fit, cause then you can follow the higher modifications.",1312416000,3,804,4.175324675324675
8239310,5,B0010XVC76,"I am an experienced kettlebell enthusiast and have tried many DVDs.  This is one of my favorites.  I love how difficult it is!  It can be made easier by using a lighter kbell.  I began with a 15# bell but now use a 10# one.  It's split into 3 sections:  clinic, drills, and core.  The drills are between 30 seconds and one minute each.  Paul stressed proper form and has modified versions of the drills.  The core workout is both fun and tough.  It will leave you with a sense of accomplishment!  If you want to take your kbell workout to a more challenging level, this is the DVD for you!",1299369600,12,589,4.216216216216216
8239311,5,B0010XVC76,"I just recently purchased Kettebell Drills and Paul Katami is a premiere professional fitness instructor.  The clinic portion of the DVD is excellent for a beginner, yet a very good workout.  I am grateful to everyone for writing honest reviews about this DVD because I was going to go with  a Biggest Loser DVD and discovered that the Jillian M. was trained by Paul Katami.  I am looking forward to postive results; with only 5 days into Paul Katami's kettlebell, I already feel my energy level increasing.",1297987200,7,507,4.793103448275862
