8482629,4,B005PR73DK,"Doesn't show much of the techniques but as the title states, the principles of Huna healing. It was spiritual and inspiring.",1419465600,,124,4.9523809523809526
8482630,5,B005PR73DK,"This video communicates it's message in a very organic and practical way. There is a level of what ""shamanism"" is that cannot and will not be communicated in any video or audio format. It is a rare thing to be able to listen to people communicate principles in any shamanistic practice without feeling like things are going over your head or that it is too far fetched and fantastical. I'm pleased to write that this video actually makes sense and when you get it and press play you will realize this for yourself. I like the way Serge brings forth his message and how Tom and Donna expand upon it from their own perspectives. There is cohesion and mutual respect in their discussion with one another. I would recommend this to anyone looking to deepen their level of awareness in the realm of therapeutic body work and personal development.",1319068800,2,841,4.651006711409396
8482631,5,B005PR73DK,"This DVD makes you feel like you are there in the room with Serge Kahili King, and Tom Cochran and Donna Jason.  The Principles are simply a ""Way of Life"", and if more people followed them, there would be less stress and strife.  As a massage instructor for several years, I am thinking of introducing some of this DVD to inspire my students to greatness.  I recommend this DVD for all those exploring healing and principles of living, and of course to all those interested in Hawaiian culture.",1318204800,,494,4.590909090909091

8482633,5,B005PR73DK,This DVD gives a very clearly presented overview of the shamanic principles of the Hawaiian Huna. In an engaging discussion Serge Kahili King presents the qualities of Huna life in a practical yet intectually stimulating conversation. This a must see for anyone interested in Huna.,1317600000,,281,5.266666666666667
8482634,5,B005PR73DK,A teaching to keep around and visit again and again. Full of pearls of wisdom to enhance your practice in this busy world. What a treat to listen to Serge once again and in such a relaxed and clear setting.,1317513600,,206,4.175
8482635,5,B005PR73DK,"I've studied Huna for a number of years from a variety of teachers, including Serge.  This session was by far the clearest and most detailed explanation of Huna I've EVER heard in a single sitting.  I was quite honored to be a part of this gathering!  I look forward to getting a copy of the DVD to share with others!",1317340800,3,317,4.25
