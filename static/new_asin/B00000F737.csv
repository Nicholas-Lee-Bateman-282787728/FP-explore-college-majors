1205673,1,B00000F737,A little heads up that it was in Spanish and would not play on a US DVD player (other than in one of the reviews) would have been useful.,1364601600,,137,3.7586206896551726
1205674,5,B00000F737,"For most of the 20th century, Native Americans were demonized..  Perhaps as wrong, modern films such as ""Dances with Wolves"" have over-sentimentalized them.  This picture fits right in between.  An alcholic manipulative rodeo man takes on an inexperienced young Native American to ride wild broncos in Rodeos...and the young man does spectacularly well. He truly enjoys his relationship with the animals.  I think of the film as an American Indian version of Paul Newman's ""The Hustler"" , but instead of a pool hall, it is the Rodeo Circuit.

All the performances seem believable, and the heart of the movie is the personal quest of the Native American to learn his roots. I think it is criminally underrated and should be seen more often by open minded moviegoers.",1355184000,3,765,4.9921259842519685
1205675,5,B00000F737,"Since I already am a Richard Widmark and Frederick Forrest fan AND  familar with alcoholic behavior it was easy to appreciate this film. I have not read the book but I have read about the book so I understand that this movie did not accurately represent the entire book, but I felt it was still a very thoughtful film. Especially where the exploitation, bigotry and insensitivity were depicted. The cinematography, direction and performances all worked well together to make this, what I call, a legitimate endeavor.",1247961600,12,516,5.0
1205676,2,B00000F737,"I picked up this movie because we were reading this novel in my freshman class that I teach. I was pretty disappointed overall. The condition of this video was awful. Although it is a video made in 1986, it seems quite older. The acting was hokey and low-budget and the film quality is lousy, being grainy and amateurish.

As far as the movie portraying Borland's novel, it does a marginal job. Tom Black Bull, the story's protagonist, must learn to live in two different worlds-- the Ute Indian's and the white man's. Although he is adept at learning the ""new ways"", Tom seems to find a longing to return to his roots. He meet a man named Red, a shady character who helps Tom to become a bull rider and make his way into the rodeo circuit. While the basic plot of the movie is there, the feel of the novel is lacking. There doesn't seem to be an effort to make the story feel important.

Although a rare video that is hard to find, I suggest you pass on this one unless you absolutely need it. I would give this a 1 1/2 stars.",1119484800,8,1027,4.2615384615384615
1205677,3,B00000F737,"An aging ex rodeo star takes in a young soft spoken native kid who wants to be in the world of professinal bullriding. As the two men win contests  all over they end up fighting because Red, (WIDMARK) Wants to win at any  cost. A great coming of age story and yet it shows that bullriding isn't  glamours it is really a way of life for some people. Another excellent  performance from Richard Widmark. The film is certainly an unsung classic  dealing with the strain of the ordinary life between a man and a boy.",967766400,16,512,4.347368421052631
7907412,1,B00000F737,"I rate every film--no matter whether I like it or not--a ""1"" whenever it's released in an effed-up form such as the wrong aspect ratio.  This film was shot in widescreen, but the bozos at 20th Century Fox have yet AGAIN released it in their MOD Cinema Archives series IN THE WRONG FORMAT! And this isn't an isolated incident, folks, these incompetent morons have done this countless other times for other widescreen films, also.  Really, what does it take for these people to understand that film fans in the twenty-first century want films that were filmed in widescreen to be presented that way on home video?  It's things like this that makes it understandable why there's hatred in the world...",1523404800,,698,4.8

7907415,3,B00000F737,"The story is good, and I am a fan of Richard Widmark who did an outstanding job, but the film was very depressing, and I disliked how the Indian boy was mistreated, discriminated against, and the depressed feeling and discrimination led me to give the film only three stars. There was also the fact, and perhaps this is the crucial one, I did not think this film said something that was not said in a host of other films, all of which said we live in a harsh world.
In the film an Indian boy, whose parents died, lived alone in the woods with his bear who he considered his brother. Then a fellow tribesman came and forced him to come learn modern culture.
Years later he was adopted by Widmark, a drunk. Widmark used the young man as a rider of wild horses in rodeos. The young man was good. But Widmark made him fake an inability, while Widmark would make large bets that he could ride next time, which he did.
But the young man did not want to cheat people. He loved animals and wanted to be with them.",1480896000,,1005,4.239583333333333
7907416,4,B00000F737,"About once each decade Hollywood rediscovers its unique artistic subgenre of rodeo films. Nick Ray's unsurpassed THE LUSTY MEN defined the elegiac template in 1952, there were two competing rodeo dramas in the 1962-63 television lineup, and even in the 1990s there were the larger-budget features 8 SECONDS, COWBOY UP, COWBOY WAY and assorted indie documentaries. In 1971-72 there was a windfall bonanza of six rodeo titles: the obscure COTTER, Stuart Rosenberg's POCKET MONEY, Cliff Robertson's J.W. COOP, Steve Ihnat's THE HONKERS and the two real keepers, Stuart Millar's WHEN THE LEGENDS DIE and Sam Peckinpah's JUNIOR BONNER, both elegiac followups to the Nick Ray masterpiece made two decades earlier.

The Peckinpah film has mammoth star power in McQueen, Preston and Lupino (and brilliant editing of its '71 Prescott rodeo footage). WHEN THE LEGENDS DIE has, by contrast, realistically subdued performances by Frederic Forrest (making his official feature debut at age 36), old pro Widmark and Luana Anders, a more authentic smalltown-rodeo feel (Bayfield and Durango, CO, and Farmington, NM) and a more literate script, by Robert Dozier working from Hal Borland's 1963 youth classic. Borland's book itself inspired serious adult-fiction rodeo-themed followups by Craig Lesley, James Welch and Michael Dorris.

The Dozier scenario covers only the most dramatic, and rodeo-active, chapters in Borland's book, and the film is special in its subgenre for the especially fine performance by Forrest (who went on to bigger but not necessarily better films for Coppola and Wenders) and wonderful widescreen color cinematography by Richard H. Kline. The domestic Fox Cinema Archive release seriously misrepresents the film by an offhand scanned transfer. Kline and Millar shot this landscape film in 1.85:1 widescreen ratio--the only way to appreciate it properly--and collectors will need a compatible player for the costlier European editions of the film. The Spanish edition--CUANDO MUEREN LAS LEYENDAS--seems to be the only completely authentic version with full running time (107'), correct anamorphic framing and dual Spanish/English soundtrack options. The film's an important and collectable one in its subgenre, deserving a more careful DVD presentation by its creating studio, and experienced rodeo people do not see the colorful big skies of the Southwest circuit through the blinkers of scanned film prints.",1473379200,,2420,5.591280653950954

7907418,3,B00000F737,A great film was TOTALLY ruined by FOX Cinema Archives not showing the film in the correct ratio. The film was shot at 1.1:85 not 1.1:33 as shown. I laugh at myself when they say that the film on dvd is being shown in a ratio more suitable to your TV. Obviously FOX are unaware that most people now have WIDESCREEN TV's.,1451692800,2,320,4.17741935483871

7907420,5,B00000F737,I'm fixing to order this movie. I had it on my DVR with Direct TV then I had to send that DVR back its not been on Direct since : ( but I'm doing away with Direct in a few days anyway. I love this movie I saw it many years ago and its never lost its allure to me. Hopefully the DVD is good or I will have to revise. I am excited to find it on Amazon and buy as soon as funds permit.,1438560000,,382,3.453488372093023
7907421,5,B00000F737,I love the movie. Actually it was filmed in Durango and Ignacio Colorado and I am one of the extras in this movie. I was pleased that it was mailed in a timely fashion and was in good shape when it was received. Thank you so much!!!,1383955200,,232,3.9574468085106385
