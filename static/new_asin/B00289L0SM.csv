8355984,1,B00289L0SM,"Any person with even a modicum of exposure to events taking place in Tibet will spot this film as a fake. This propagandistic film, clearly churned out by the Chinese Communist Party, purports that religious freedom, particularly for Tibetans, is alive and well in modern Tibet, conveniently omitting the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has been occupying and committing cultural genocide in Tibet since the 1950s.

This documentary is particularly offensive when considered against the backdrop of the recent rash of self-immolations taking place across Tibet in protest against Chinese Communist oppression.

As an alternative (and in addition to the documentaries mentioned by the previous reviewer), I recommend, ""Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion.""  Note that ""Cry of the Snow Lion"" (2004) pre-dates the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (2005), which has since flooded Lhasa with an influx of Han Chinese migrants, rendering the indigenous Tibetan population a minority in their own country. As a result, Tibetans have been economically sidelined, with their culture and language under increasing threat.",1341964800,,1116,5.552941176470588
8355985,1,B00289L0SM,"This movie is a nothing more than Chinese communist propaganda with low-to-medium production values.  Whereas there is some historical information concerning Buddhism in Tibet (which is what the title actually should have been since Tibet is its own country despite the Chinese invasion in 1959) it also utilizes omissions, misinformation, and outright lies to make the case that everyone in China (Tibet included) have political and religious freedoms.  In fact, it makes this statement every few minutes.  The documentary tries to convince the viewer of this by such tactics as showing the official Communist Party recognition of their handpicked 11th Panchen Lama.  What it fails to mention is the fact that,  at the age of 5, the real Panchen Lama (as recognized by the  14th Dali Lama) and his family was  kidnapped ""for their protection"" back in 1995 by the communists and they have never been seen since.  The movie shows monastery after monastery in rubble without explaining that it was the Chinese government who destroyed 99% of all the monasteries in Tibet while torturing and killing hundreds of thousands of monks, nuns, and laypersons in the process.  Don't waste your time with this ""documentary"".
