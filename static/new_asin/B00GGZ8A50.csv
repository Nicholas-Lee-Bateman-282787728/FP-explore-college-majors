8623035,3,B00GGZ8A50,"Both Katie Price (aka Jordan) and Peter Andre have had their lives and relationship(s) well documented in the press, most notably within the British media.  They married shortly after meeting in the Australian jungle, both taking part in the British reality television programme 'I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!', and have been very successful in manipulating the press to their own financial gain, with many reality television shows documenting their family life as part of the 'Katie & Peter' series/franchise.
Now that they have divorced under a huge cloud of media backlash, there are naturally many people inquisitive as to how this highly publicised relationship came to its end, and both parties have gone on to do their own respective reality programmes and pursue individual business ventures.
This DVD, which contains the independent documentary film 'Katie Price & Peter Andre - Uncensored', was released on 27th November 2009 and was distributed by Classic Rock Distribution, along with Angry Penguin Limited and Archive Media Publishing.  The whole short documentary is, indeed, a wholly independent project, being one-hundred per-cent unauthorised and in no way at all associated or approved by both Peter and Katie and/or their respective past and present management.
The running time of this short film is about forty-five minutes in total, so does not cover a tremendous amount of ground relating to the couple, but it does provide an interesting insight into Katie especially, and how she has maintained herself as a successful businesswoman in the face of adversity.  Truth be told, the emphasis is more on Katie and less on Peter, with a selection of trained psychologists and media personnel analysing Katie's body language during interviews and how she has progressed over the years from Page Three glamour model to self-made millionaire.  A look into her upcoming underwear range for women of all sizes is included, and there are specific archive interviews with both Katie and Peter explaining how they attempt to avoid the stresses of maintaining a married couple's celebrity profile.
Of course, there are many other platforms to explore the works of both Katie and Peter, most notably Katie's range of autobiographies and ghost-writings, as well as Peter's extensive discography that he has acquired over the years.  Plus, there are numerous unofficial biographies detailing their split and subsequent relationships following on from this.
This short film looking at both Katie's and Peter's media profiles serves as a nice little accompaniment to other published entries in the Katie and Peter franchise, even though there a few shortcomings, such as in the way of scene repetition, for example.
It is of importance to note that this release is encoded Region O and is both PAL and NTSC optimised.  It was released a couple of years ago under the title of 'Katie Price and Peter Andre - Uncensored', which is the title of the short documentary film that this release contains, before being re-packaged and re-distributed via this DVD release of 'Katie Price - It's a Jungle Out There!'",1388620800,,3117,5.199203187250996
