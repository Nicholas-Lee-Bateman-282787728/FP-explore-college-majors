8230836,4,B000Y2WAKC,"Actually two episodes of a Brit doc. The gems here are:

-Hanging out with the illustrious Lee Perry at his infamous Black Arc studio for some crazy session time and wisdom. If you know his story you will love this footage.

- In the studio with Bunny Lee and crew, sitting in on a true dub hands-on mix session. A lesson of how its not the gear, its the people with taste laying down the sound.

The film's production has the good sense to often just let the camera roll, making few cuts or interruptions. This a a long satisfying format where you get the entire take. There are some great performances in both live and studio situations. Its a treat to be in the room.

There is a great deal of rare archival footage and nice background given through the narrative track. Some wonderful gatherings of early reggae's heroes. But if you are not already seriously interested in the genre I suspect this will not really grab you. Its for the hardcore fan.",1209081600,5,953,4.459770114942529
8230837,5,B000Y2WAKC,"this is some of the best reggae footage of all time.  I've had a copy of this full series (ep. 1-6) for a couple years that someone recorded back when it was aired.  Episode 4 (black ark) is just pure amazing.  the lee perry footage will blow your mind.  there are a couple sessions at the black ark with scratch on the mic singing daniel saw the stone and ganja man.  It seems as if he is improvising much of the lyrics.... If you are a fan of reggae, do yourself a favor and GET THIS.  (ps: there is some amazing footage of some rasta smoke sessions too.  i mean...amazing).",1200528000,6,576,4.181818181818182
