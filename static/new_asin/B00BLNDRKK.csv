5644005,4,B00BLNDRKK,"I was expecting more for a 40th anniversary Blue Ray disc.

5644026,1,B00BLNDRKK,"This movie is a complete waste of time.  Henry Fonda sleepwalks through a real boring sleeper with no real drama, no real acting, a boring plot, and terrible music.  Why others rate this piece of junk 4 or 5 Stars excapes me.

Terrible, just terrible.",1515456000,,251,4.533333333333333
5644027,5,B00BLNDRKK,"A great western all in all. I liked Henry Ford's role here, not his absolute best, but it was good. Funny and witty at times with drama. The ending was pretty good in the French Quarter of New Orleans.
The picture and sound were pretty good here for this Blu-ray release. The picture isn't ""digitally restored"", which would eliminate any dirt and glitches in the film, but otherwise, I would say it looks decent for the year it came out.

** There are NO Special Features here at all on this release. I would have thought that an ""Anniversary Edition"" would have at least the Theatrical Trailer. I'm not sure at this point if you can get anyone that was a part of this movie to come forward with some interview or something. If this was made/released in 1974, it would be 44 years old for just the movie.
** This release has the ITALIAN opening title and credits. The DVD version that came out years ago, for which I have, has the ENGLISH opening titles and credits. Now I have the Bluray/DVD combo. Woo hoo!
Highly recommended for all Western fans!",1515196800,,1049,4.463541666666667
5644028,5,B00BLNDRKK,"Definitely my favorite Western film of all time. Perfect amount of action blended with a ton of slapstick, silly, over-the-top comedy.

5644056,3,B00BLNDRKK,"I'm not sure what this movie was trying to do.  It had some interesting concepts and certainly good acting--but it flittered that away by presenting a ridiculously disjointed story and uneven tone.

If you've seen the Trinity movies, you will walk into this film with a certain expectation.  In those movies, Trinity was a little over-the-top, reckless, but still grounded to reality.  He never did things that seemed clownish.  Here, however, he's a total clown.  He's barely likeable--which is terribly sad since Trinity is one of the best characters in western cinema because he's the opposite of every cowboy in films.

In this movie he's (let's just get it out) an angelic figure.  Look at the cover of the box and you can immediately tell that.  There are a few points in the film where Fonda's character makes the same observation.  And then you watch these excessive action scenes where Trinity is unphased and untouchable.  Clearly, that's what this movie was going for.

This movie is very similar to A Christmas Carol or The Preacher's Wife--where angels come to guide a lost character.  It would have been a rather interesting take for this in the western genre.  But it flopped here.

The overall problem with this film is that it simply doesn't know what tone it wants to convey.  The scenes with Trinity alone are comical (to a brief extent--the ""comedy"" is rather thin).  But when he meets up with Ford's character the tone is out of alignment.  Ford, for example, plays his character with a straight face.  He's very good at it, too.  But then the camera will cut to Trinity and he'll talk gibberish that irritates both Ford and the viewer.  Frankly, Ford's character would have shot Trinity many times in the movie--funny enough, Ford's character does try to do that, so maybe the writers knew how desperately we'd want Trinity's angelic character to drop dead!

Anyway, it's a lost cause.  The story needed to be much more refined.  Ford's character isn't fleshed out--half the time you're trying to figure out what the hell he's up to, but not in the mysterious way--the story is so poorly written that you literally have no idea what he's doing.  And Trinity should have been much  more toned-down.

This could have been a great morality play--the last hero of his time trying to escape his past, but his past is right on his heels; he's trying to avoid it, running and gunning out of this world into another (crossing the ocean to Europe).  But Destiny forces him to remember who he really is, what he once stood for, and make a decision that could see him dead.

THAT is what the story fundamentally was about.  As I said before, the elements are all there, but it's so awkwardly, stupidly, clumsily executed that the great parts are lost.  It's sad.  Ford does a great job, despite the script's numerous flaws.  And Hill--well, I don't know.  I think that Hill felt a lot more comfortable acting Trinity in the tone-down, lazy fashion that character was previously written.  In this film, however, Hill seems out of place with the stupid antics and outrageous behavior he has to perform.

Those few moments where Trinity is serious, calm, lucid are brilliant.  Especially the scene at the Indian graveyard.  When he finally has a chance to meet Ford's character face-to-face in a shoot-out.  That entire scene is very well crafted and acted.  Indeed, Hill's Trinity in that short moment is an enticing, likable, interesting character.  There are a few places in the movie where that just shines.

Now, technically I have to say that this movie was shot BEAUTIFULLY.  There are so many brilliant, amazing shots that despite the lackluster story, I was truly happy with the setting and camera work.  My favorite is when Trinity comes into town during a festival and walks smack into someone on stilts.  That series of shots is simply wonderful--the angle up to this man on stilts truly makes him seem giant, how the sun reflects off the lens, how the face is distorted, and the voice booming.  And then Trinity cuts the image down to size--in a truly great moment of perfect storytelling and camera movement.

Unfortunately, the technical greatness of this movie doesn't save it.  Should you watch it?  Yes.  Should you buy a fresh, new copy of the movie?  No.  Buy it used.",1497139200,,4296,4.775510204081633

5644111,5,B00BLNDRKK,"When your opponents, even the weakest is so good, there is only one word to describe the main character whom Terence Hill portrait, invincible and legend. I don't know why hollywood action movies today makes their heroes so powerful and superb, the enemies so weak and dumb, there is no comparison at all, consequently, there is no suspension and tensions anymore because you know the heroes are going to win easily, it is retarded and unrealistic to say. Some hollywood directors and film producers and Writers really need to get out of their comfortable social circle, life style and environment and experience the real world not only in America but worldwide physically and mentally; Unless, the only goal of them is to make big bucks and have a comfortable luxury lives with nothing more and nothing less they want to achieve, then I have nothing to say but watch movies made foreignly, it could be sometimes better than the ones made here...",1476576000,2,946,4.845679012345679

Fonda's character is a legend and someone is always calling him out to a gunfight, but all he wants to do is retire and live the rest of his life in peace. Nobody wants him to go out in a blaze of glory. They become friends and not to spoil it for you....Nobody becomes the legend.

My Name is Nobody has its annoying excesses, mind you, but it also boasts a joyful-quirky, eternally youthful film score that alone guarantees repeat viewings. In addition it has the playful charm of Terence Hill doing what no American actor seems capable of (being cocky, erotically supercharged, and sweetly endearing all at the same time) as well as the world-weary reflectiveness of Henry Fonda to touch your heart. Morricone's musical genius does more than its share of the work in making Nobody an emotionally complex experience.

5644318,5,B00BLNDRKK,"Back in the day, not everyone liked spaghetti westerns.
I did.
And having recently watched 'My Name is Nobody' for the first time in more than three decades, I know why I enjoyed them so much.
Terence Hill and Henry Fonda - yes, THE Henry Fonda - team up in this movie about an aging gunfighter who just wants to retire and a young protege who thinks that the legendary shootist has to go out with a bang.
Produced by Sergio Leone, who invented the spaghetti western, and featuring a musical score by Ennio Morricone - who did the famous scores for 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' as well as 'A Fistful of Dollars' - the film is a classic of the genre.
That sounds a little pretentious so let me just say that it has the requisite number of gunfights, appealing - if somewhat roguish - heroes and enough villains to go around. Hill, who starred in the 'My Name is Trinity' spaghetti westerns back in the Seventies, is at the top of his game as the raffish drifter who seems always to be just one jump ahead of a bullet. Fonda, he of the steely glare and the softly menacing voice, is just what you'd expect from an Academy Award-winning actor: Excellent as the aging gunslinger.
Hill would say later that 'My Name is Nobody' was his favorite movie and it's clear when you watch it that he is very much enjoying the opportunity to share screen time with Fonda.
If you like spaghetti westerns, you'll like 'My Name if Nobody.'

I use the same player on a daily basis, and I have not had this problem with other discs.

5644426,3,B00BLNDRKK,"We've come to a place in the genre of the Spaghetti Western, which was essentially created by Sergio Leone in 1964 with 'Fistful of Dollars', where the movies are starting to get a little more comical and silly. Even Ennio Morricone's score seems much more playful than his previous in the Dollars trilogy, not to mention that part of it was recycled from Once Upon a Time in the West. It seems Leone's name was only attached to this project as a favor to Tonino Valerii, who was the films official director.

The continual reference to 'The Wild Bunch' and even a grave marked 'Sam Peckinpah' (the director of The Wild Bunch) seems like too obvious a nod to the classic American Western. The protagonist of the film (Nobody) is definitely no Clint Eastwood, instead Terence Hill's character thrives much more on goofy antics and seemingly unreasonable feats (who in the world could possibly drink that much whiskey and stay standing?).

The casting of Henry Fonda, who was pretty late in his career at this point, was an apparent attempt to re-create the chemistry he added to ...in the West. If you love or are really interested in Spaghetti Westerns, this might be worth a watch, but overall it really isn't strong enough to stand with the greats in the sub-genre.",1397606400,5,1267,4.728506787330317

5644442,2,B00BLNDRKK,one of the few non Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns that approaches his excellent work is marred by a terrible BLU RAY transfer. I picked this up at Best Buy for ten bucks and thought I just made a great deal as I enjoy the movie and remember a pretty good version on DVD sometime back.  Well I popped this in just to make sure it worked and was shocked to see more vertical white lines than on the recent Buster Keaton film I was watching from 1920!  The master print used obviously was damaged and NOTHING was done to repair it..... for them to list this at 25 bucks is a pure crime.  I just wanted to let folks know that were thinking of upgrading to BR to be prepared for a lot less than the cover and it's 40th Anniversary Edition seems to offer.,1395792000,8,750,4.158620689655172

Terrence HIll is just about perfect as Nobody and Henry Fonda does a great job as the tired hero looking for a way out. My favorite scenes are the saloon scene with the drinking/shooting game and the rotating wooden slap master - both are hilarious. Based only on this movie I'm going to order the Trinity movies too.

The film runs almost 116 minutes, though the steel boxcover reads '1H51'.  And yes, the 'F' word is used, so perhaps Image with their PG rating has not opted for its inclusion.
The extras are formidable, but lack subtitles in English, though French subtitles are included.  They are ""Nobody is... perfect (55m.); ""Tonino Valerii and the Western"" (12m.); ""Sergio Leone"" (48m.), and feature length commentary by director Valerii!
Furthermore the English 2.0 language track has imbedded subtitles in French.

Sergio Leone had the concept for this movie and did some of the directing. Meanwhile, Ennio Marricone did the score, spoofing his earlier 'Man with No Name' theme, the 'Ride of the Valkeries' and a bit from 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.  Many people say this is a bad western, but don't watch it as a western, nor as a true spaghetti western, but as a final run for Henry Fonda in a western as he retires with a bang.

5644551,4,B00BLNDRKK,"Esteemed director Sergio Leone shares the spotlight with Tonino Valeri to helm this wonderful sendoff to the Spaghetti Western.

Here's the scoop. Terence Hill is Nobody who has raised Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) to the level of icon of the old, gunslinger West. Fonda neither wants nor needs an acolyte at this point in his life. He just needs $500.00 and a boat ticket to Europe. But Hill won't let go. He is determined to see Fonda go out in a blaze of glory.

This is a real hoot. Terence Hill has created one of the most goofy, memorable characters in cinema. He, on one level, seems simple minded, but you realize he's actually a step ahead of everyone and everything around him. Fonda is past his prime but he still has some gas in the tank and his wits are in good order. He just wants out. The movie itself fluctuates between seriousness and self deprecation. Some of the visual gags are something you might see in a Three Stooges reel, while others are classic Leone.

The story isn't quite as streamlined as, say, 'The Man With No Name' films but it hangs together enough. Ennio Morricone is on hand for the soundtrack which fluctuates somewhat. The opening scene has a theme, repeated throughout, that is kind of wussy sounding. Other passages are really good. But his treatment of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkerie"" has to be heard to be believed. The film has a great look to it, even though I saw a pretty awful transfer. The sound mixing was very good.

This is a great Leone outing. If you're at all a fan of his, this is a nice swan song to the genre.",1346889600,,1568,4.452961672473868

5644554,5,B00BLNDRKK,"""My Name is Nobody"" is one of the old comedy westerns that is great to watch..  I was extremely happy to find that this had been now released on DVD.. the old VHS copies pale in comparison to the visual clarity of this release. Henry Fonda plays a classy gunfighter icon who wants to retire, yet is still pursued by those who want the fame of knocking off the west's most famous fast draw. Enter Terence Hill under the name of ""Nobody"", who idolizes Fonda, and likely is faster on the draw than his idol. Great gunfights feature crazy fast-draw feats, spotted with drama and humor; and range from facing one to 150 desperadoes. Well written, directed, and acted.  One of the top ten westerns to have in any movie library.",1341360000,,721,4.4961832061068705
5644555,3,B00BLNDRKK,"If you're a fan of Leone's Eastwood/Dollars westerns and watch this expecting more of the same, a word of warning. Although a spaghetti western, one produced and partly directed by Leone, this comes from the end of the cycle of Italian westerns. It was also made after the critical mauling Leone received over Once upon a Time in the West. As if to soothe his critics he seems to be saying that he doesn't take the genre that seriously either and is keen to send it up. The result is eccentric at best.

Leone's early films have a keenly defined aesthetic - both on screen and in their general mood. It's their cynicism, amorality and menace that make them so engrossing. Here, the tone is whimsical instead (a fact reinforced by one of Morricone's more unusual and self-referential scores). Gone are the gypsy physiognomies: in their place, fresh faced boys.

Perhaps the biggest difference is with comedy. Leone's original trilogy was often raucously funny, drawing on the comedy dell' arte, but here the humour is plain juvenile. And there's a lot of it. In fact I've seen this film described as a comedy. It may have made 70s audiences laugh, but if failed to illicit much mirth in me. The comedy is also usually in the form of sketches - the whisky shoot out in the salon (filmed by Leone himself), the bizarre urinal scene. Rather than being integrated into the plot, they stop it dead. The result is, in my opinion, on the wrong side of indulgent. When these are combined with some of the better moments - such as the wonderful riding shots of the Wild Bunch in White Sands - one feels this is a film with no unity of purpose.

Having said all that, there are some gems hidden away here: the stilt walker, the Sam Peckinpah joke, the sound design of the opening sequence. The film is also constantly visually inventive.

It's also worth noting that although we know Leone wrote the script and actually filmed large sections of it, ultimately it's Tonino Valeri who's listed as director, so perhaps I'm being a little unfair making such an explicit connection with Leone's earlier work.

One for aficionados rather than general viewers, I think.",1339372800,2,2151,4.6798941798941796

It is a thoughtful, interesting story, as many of his movies tell, and well acted, but not very well directed or filmed. His amateurish use of pans and zooms are distracting and the overly long scenes which do little to advance the story are often rather boring without conveying much of the suspense they are meant to suggest. I have often wondered as I watch his movies, if he has spent much time watching well made films, or merely cut his teeth on silent slapstick and just rushed out to make his own. They were popular I suppose, in an era when people were searching for something new, but his techniques have not aged well and are thankfully gone from more modern cinema. He came and went, and left his mark, but it wasn't a very high one.

There are some humorous and enjoyable segments in the movie.  The Morricone soundtrack is obviously quality stuff as is the care that went into production.

5644587,4,B00BLNDRKK,"So here's a quote: ""I see it clear as crystal. Jack Beauregard, standing alone, facing the Wild Bunch."" That sentence, as uttered by the greatest admirer of infamous, aging gunfighter Jack Beauregard, encapsulates the movie's premise.

1899, and Beauregard yearns to hang up his guns and sail off into the sunset (man's even got the ship picked out, set to shove off in slightly over two weeks). Except that his biggest fan, a flashy young quickdraw artist calling himself ""Nobody,"" just won't let him go out like that, not without one last splashy hurrah. And, somehow, Nobody manages to orchestrate an epic shoot-em-'up between Beauregard and the 150 grim pistoleros who make up the Wild Bunch. But even that, as it turns out, wouldn't be Beauregard's final showdown.

Some bloke named Tonino Valerii gets screen credit for directing this one, but, let's just be honest, in its flavor and sensibilities, MY NAME IS NOBODY is a straight-up Sergio Leone western (word is that Valerii resented Leone for pretty much taking over a chunk of his directorial duties). This is one of the final spaghetti westerns Leone would be involved in, and this would've been a good one to go out on, except that he then went and stuck his nose into the inferior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Genius-Two-Partners-and-a-Dupe/dp/B000GIXCCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe</a>, which also starred Terence Hill playing a very similar character to Nobody. Anyway, with MY NAME IS NOBODY, Sergio Leone does get credit for coming up with the story concept, but then goes uncredited onscreen for executive producing the thing and for directing a few scenes here and there. Still, he leaves his mark all over the picture.

The first time I saw this film, I was wracked with suspense. Terence Hill's performance is opaque enough that you're not quite certain if Nobody truly places Beauregard on such a high pedestal or if he's actually setting him up for a one-on-one showdown, so as to claim the rep of being the West's top gun? Having already made the popular Trinity films, Hill was sought out for this role. And dude here is like Bugs Bunny come to life; his performance is, on the surface, the most memorable. But as fun as Terence Hill is as the playful ""Nobody"" and as much as I relished his Three Stooges shenanigans, it's Henry Fonda who puts the heart into the film and who makes the film resonate. There's an elegiac feel to the film, of the old west fading out and giving way to a more modern era. And this is embodied by the tired and weathered Beauregard passing the torch to his eager, young acquaintance Nobody. Fonda's underplaying balances out Hill's over-the-top routines. It's fine work Fonda does, and I get a kick out of his quietly perplexed and bemused reactions to Nobody. And, yet, as good as he is here, Fonda was even better in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-the-West/dp/B0000AUHPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>&nbsp;(talk about elegiac!).

There are some striking moments, and also some just plain oddball stuff. There's one funny sequence in which Nobody saunters thru a town on what must have been carnival day. And watch for the saloon drinking game (""Can I do it with milk?"" wails Nobody), which culminates with Nobody demonstrating his slap-draw skills. One weird scene I didn't dig too much is the scuffle in the mirror funhouse. Another classic, of course, is Nobody taking on some ruffians with a wooden dummy. And there's also an indecipherable parable about a little birdie and a cowpie...

There's even a little dig at director Sam Peckinpah.

MY NAME IS NOBODY (or MIO NOME E NESSUNO, as they say in Italy) wouldn't be halfway as effective if not for composer Ennio Morricone's contributions. Here, Morricone incorporates echoes of his scoring from past Leone classics. And, since this is a comedy, note that the Wild Bunch's ominous appearances are heralded by a theme score injected with an impish Ride of the Valkyries riff. Weird, but cool.

Blazing guns, and pies flung thru the air. And the film even demonstrates one sure-fire course of action you can take to make sure the barber doesn't cut your throat while he's giving you a shave. There's silliness and a theatrical playfulness, and both tempered with a mythic element and a certain sadness. Which isn't at all easy to pull off. Yet, Henry Fonda and Terence Hill make it work, as does Sergio Leone (what, is Tonino Valerii still gritting his teeth?).

And, lastly, does anyone get that story about the little birdie and the cowpie? I'm still a bit flummoxed...",1227139200,4,4706,5.102597402597403

5644589,4,B00BLNDRKK,"Jack Beauregard is a legendary gunslinger who's hanging up his pistols and sailing to Europe to live out the rest of his days in peace.  That's until Nobody shows up and begins stalking him.  Jack can't figure out why Nobody is constantly around and becomes increasingly frustrated with him, unsure if he's friend or foe.  Nobody is probably the fastest gun alive, but a total buffoon and a klutz.....or is he?  He may be a goof, but Nobody has a plan and he's determined to see it through.  He's idolized Jack all his life and can't accept Jack simply going out with a whimper.  He wants to make Jack a legend by having him do something extraordinary.  His plan(part of it anyway) is to have Jack face off with a gang of 150 outlaws.  Most of the film is Nobody's attempts to lure Jack into this situation, as well as getting into a few misadventures of his own.  Naturally, Jack doesn't share this enthusiasm and spends most of the film trying to elude that situation.  Through this series of events a strange and almost heartwarming friendship develops.
This is a great comedy spaghetti western.  Yes, the comedy is a bit hit and miss.  Some of it's dead on while other parts are downright silly(I personally don't care for the sped up camera technique when Nobody slaps people around or draws his gun).  Regardless of how funny you think the movie is, it's a very good story and a good movie all around.  Fonda's wonderful as the aging gunfighter, almost as good as his villain role in Once Upon A Time In The West.  Terence Hill, best known for the Trinity films(and don't forget Superfuzz!!), is kind of a comedic version of Franco Nero(he certainly looks like him).  He's good with facial expressions and physical comedy, yet you can also buy him as a gunfighter.  Sergio Leone produces and provided the story, and his presence is definitely felt even though he didn't direct.  Morricone's excellent soundtrack solidifies this.

5644593,4,B00BLNDRKK,"""My Name is Nobody"" a spaghetti western parody conjured up by the master of the genre Sergio Leone, was aptly directed by Tonino Valerii.  Featuring Henry Fonda as retiring legendary gunslinger Jack Beauregard the film featured outstanding cinematography using the scenic panoramas of New Mexico as a backdrop.  Leone and Valerii obviously enjoying the production of the flick, particularly poked fun at director Sam Peckinpah.

The plot surrounded the idol worship of young quick draw gunman named Nobody played by Terence Hill for the aged Fonda.  Hill conjured up a scenario where the retiring Fonda would go out in a blaze of glory to end his storied career as the fastest gun in the west.  Hill contrived to have Fonda shoot it out with the 150 member Wild Bunch as his final act of gunfighting skill.

Featuring endless displays of shooting skills both Hill and Fonda lead the mostly international cast through a series of comedic scenes, far different from Leone's classic hard biting Clint Eastwood trilogy.  ""My Name is Nobody"" however has it's place among the classics of the genre putting a humorous slant on this often edgy and tension filled style of movie making.",1190764800,,1177,4.974489795918367

Terence Hill is simply wonderful in his comic variation of Clint's man with no name.  It's too bad that he wasn't utilized properly in American films.  ""Mr Billion"" and ""Super Fuzz"", please.  Henry Fonda is at his iconic best as the retiring gunslinger.  The polar styles of Hill and Fonda work fabulously.  If the film can be faulted it's for length and story lapses.  There were times I thought the narrative a little incoherent.  Lastly, Ennio Morricone contributes a fantastic score.  Morricone not only references previous Leone ventures, most prominently ""Once Upon A Time in the West"", but also cleverly incorporates Wagner.

5644601,5,B00BLNDRKK,"This is my all-time favorite film. I originally recorded it on Beta when  in college. Normally I don't like silly action movies, but I made an exception for this one because it made up for it in so many ways. It's about a passing of the torch from one generation to the next, and  it's full of comedy, but it was the ideas which parallelled real life that made it work for me. Like how we all need heroes to inspire us, or at least something to believe in. It's also about the way life changes, how childhood innocence gets replaced by the hard realities of adulthood. ""Nobody"" represents this youth and innocence, seemingly unaware of his own mortality as he follows around his idol Jack Beauregard, and making sure Jack's legend is cemented in the history books. Along the way we find that ""Nobody"" is every bit as fast as his hero, except that he's chosen a different method to display his skills. Unlike Jack, ""Nobody"" is a fun-loving clown who craves attention and fame (""I like folks ta see me.""), except rather than basking in the spotlight he chooses to fly under the radar in order to avoid the pitfalls that come with such fame. In contrast to his goofy exterior, Nobody is smarter than he lets on, he enjoys playing people (I guess I liked this film so much because I related so well to the title character). The movie contains one of the all time classic bar scenes in which Nobody wins a drinking game by fooling everyone, then using his amazing speed, he embarrasses the bar bully by slapping him silly. (this scene was resurrected and used in a nationally televised phone commercial in 2006) In the spirit of 1970's spaghetti westerns, both of our heros' shooting skills are wildly exagerrated. They are the very best of their generations, and a climactic showdown between the two is inevitable. I won't say who wins because the answer to that is what made this movie so memorable. The post-fight narrative is priceless, with Henry Fonda's voice providing the perfect commentary (This is my favorite part of the film).  For me the movie is a profound commentary on real life. It points out how modern culture was making the role of the gunfighter obsolete, and it speaks to how times change, and how once idealic figures and lifestyles can become extinct (a good example is the fall of the Italian Mobs, and indeed the spaghetti western genre itself), and how, in the face of all this, we must make a decision - to step aside (like Jack), to continue on (and die), or as in Nobody's case, to find a way to do both, by fooling everyone!! I just love when films come full circle, and when certain themes repeat themselves ( like Jack teaching Nobody to wield his gun as a deterrent when getting a shave). This film had it all: glorified heroes, wild gunfights, clever motifs, comedy, an unforgettable title, AND, the great music of Ennio Morricone!  (""Just one more piece of advice from an old-timer;  when you're gettin a shave and a cut, make sure the right man's wearin the jacket"")",1173916800,3,2998,4.585820895522388
5644602,5,B00BLNDRKK,"Tonino Valerii was Sergio Leones cinematographer of choice, and it is assumed that Sergio Leone directed at least some of this wonderful Western, in addition to his stated 'producer' role.

The style, the trademark Ennio Morricone music, the nostalgia for disappearing times and the locations all are familiar Leone staples, but this movie showcases humour and more script than we normally expect from him.

Be aware that this is a comedic take, but done so subtly and charmingly by Nobody (played by the perfect cast blonde blue eyed Terence Hill) and his interplay with Henry Fonda, that it never gets in the way of the style and story.

Henry Fonda represents the old West, and maybe even the old Western, who is planning to move to Europe and live out the rest of his years. Nobody is the character who appears a buffoon and simple minded but is actually possibly the smartest of them all, and maybe the fastest on the draw. His desire is to see his hero go down not fading away into old age, but in a blaze of glory..

Right down to the finale, the interchanges between them are touching as well as bringing a smile to your face, and while occasionally the humour is more slapstick than you might be used to, overall you are left with a nostalgic glow from the heartwarming ending.

If you like Westerns, or if you like Leone, or even if you just like something a little different, then this is a must see.",1170979200,3,1411,4.539370078740157
5644603,5,B00BLNDRKK,"While a couple of other films that Sergio Leone was involved with - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In The West - are, in my opinion not just cinematic masterpieces in the western genre, but brilliant in any genre, this film is just very, very entertaining.

Clearly, screen legend Henry Fonda enjoyed his film experience on Once Upon A Time In The West so much that he elected to make another film that Leone was involved with.

In the movie, Fonda plays aging gunfighter lawman / legend Jack Beauregard, who sees the rough-and-tumble west of the 1860's -1880's fading away and being replaced by a more ""civilized"" west of the late 1890's / turn of the century. It's not dissimilar to the same theme of the Wild Bunch and Monte Walsh - older men who see the times shifting beneath their feet.

In this film, Fonda decides that it's best to make a graceful exit and take a slow boat to Europe.

But Nobody - played by Terrance Hill - has other ideas. He admired Beauregard as a young boy (you could almost see young Nobody reading dime novels about his ""hero"") and decides that he can't just fade away - he has to go out in a blaze of glory.

There are some very, very funny moments in the film - how about the the drinking and shooting skills scene in the bar where he slaps the bald gunfighter silly. Or Squirrel with the grinding teeth..??

And throughout the film, Ennio Morricone provides another brilliant soundtrack. Sertiously, could this man make a bad musical score - I don't think so.

Leone doesn't get any directing credits for this film - the goes to somebody else.

But clearly you can see his fingerprints all over this movie. You almost get the feeling that after making The Good The Bad and The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In The West, he sat back and realized that he had created his materpieces. These were his gold medal winning performances.

Now, now he could relax and make a western that was a labour of love - an entertaining project made for fun.

And it certainly succeeds on that level.

Trinity plays an up and coming gunfighter wanting the attention but also has a dream of seeing Henry Fonda single handeling taking on the Wild Bunch, a hundred of the toughest riding outlaws the west has ever seen. The whole movie builds to this moment as Trinity's character leads Henry Fonda into his taking on the Wild Bunch. I consider this one of the great moments in any Western.

The quip about Sam Peckinpah (a beautiful name in Navajo) and reference to The Wild Bunch help keep the story interesting. Unlike what another reviewer was saying it actually does make perfect sense and by the end it all comes together nicely.

The cinematography, as in most all Leone flicks, is fantastic and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is wonderful albeit a little odd. I'm used to hearing his soundtracks in a much more serious way but it is obvious he has put an almost childlike/childish slant on this one which is again... a little odd.

If this is a comedy why do parts of the score, combined with absolutely desolate cinematography, invoke some very sorrowful feelings? This film is almost unique in that it successfully brings comedy into a moral drama and, in the end, comes up with something that isn't contradictory and really lame.

The small scene with the story about a bird told while playing pool is worth the price alone, and the interaction between Hill and Fonda is superb. I spent the next twenty years keeping an eye out for it. I finally caught it on TV again a few years back and taped it to VHS, but it was a low quality signal so it is not a very good tape.

This is a spoof of all the 'quick draw' Westerns, and about time!

Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) is a notorious gunslinger--the stuff legends are made of--and the hero of Nobody (Terence Hill) who has idolized him all his life.  Nobody has the dream of seeing Beauregard hold off the entire Wild Bunch, numbering 150 or so hard cases, single-handedly, so that his name will go down in history.  His idol, however, is reluctant to fuifill his wish.

Of course, Nobody is no slouch with a shootin' iron, either, as he demonstrates.

This is a hilarious film, with a great many funny moments, and a surprise ending.  I thought it was great, and I hope it entertains you also.

 This is the best of Sergio Leone.
 The date is June 3, 1899. Henry Fonda is ""Jack Beauregard. He has shot many people in his time. You can't corner him. He is out to get 150 people called the ""Wild Bunch"". Some travel together in a big stampede. Terence Hill comes along as ""Nobody"". He meets ""Jack Beauregard"" and basically already knows all the trivia about him he has learned since childhood. Beauregard would like to ""retire"" and has a reservation for a boat in New Orleans in 16 days. ""Nobody"" tells Beauregard ""he has got to go out in style"".

  There was no sequel made to this film.  There is another Terence Hill Italian film where the title was changed for a favorable English title.

He plays the character of ""Joe Thanks"".

5644635,5,B00BLNDRKK,"""My Name Is Nobody"" 1973 (Released in U.S. in 1974)
Rated: PG
Director: Tonino Valerii
Starring: Henry Fonda (Jack Beauregard), Terrence Hill (Nobody)
Music by: Ennio Morriconne
Running Time: 1 hour and 55 minutes
  Entertaining Spaghetti Western based on an idea from and produced by Sergio Leone (of ""Fistfull of Dollars"" fame) featuring Terrence Hill as the title character, a mild-mannered drifter, who just happens to be the fastest gun in the west.
  The movie is set in 1899 in the waning days of the wild west in America (the movie was filmed in the American southwest and Spain). An aged gunfighter, Jack Beuaregard (Fonda), the west's most famous gunslinger, is worn out by the rigors of his trade and plans to retire to Europe.  ""Nobody"" has grown up admiring Beauregard (he can quote from memory each of his victims) and follows him about the southwest attempting to get him to face the Wild Bunch, a band of 150 gunmen, so that he can ""go out in style"".
  Eventually Beauregard agrees and together they hatch a plan to take on all 150 of the Wild Bunch at one time.
  This movie is a comedic western that features top-notch performances by its two leads as well as a magnificent soundtrack (as always) by Morricone.
  The movie is chock full of memorable scenes, especially the opening sequence in the barber shop and the showdown with the Wild Bunch (who's every appearance in the film is heralded by Morricone's version of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"").  Look also for a nod to Sam Peckinpah (in addition to the Wild Bunch) in the cemetary scene with Beauregard and Nobody.
  This is a great film that can be viewed by the whole family and can be enjoyed many times over.  If you enjoy the genre, you'll love this movie.  Highly recommended.",1069372800,12,1760,4.7026143790849675
5644636,1,B00BLNDRKK,"This movie was HORRIBLE!  I can't believe Henry Fonda would reduce himself to that.  I bought it for the New Mexico scenes (Mogollon, Acoma, and White Sands), but I had read the other reviews here and thought it might be good.  Wow, what do I need to smoke before I watch it to make it bearable?  It was not funny, it was stupid.  The plot (if it had one) was impossible to follow.  Fonda was good, but Terrence Hill was a total ham, complete corn. No wonder he never made any serious movies, HE CAN""T ACT!
Unlike most of the others who have posted reviews, I would rate this as the WORST movie ever made (with the exception of Telephon, with Charles Bronson).
The only funny part in the whole movie was the music part where they played ""Ride of the Valkeries"" on what sounded like automobile horns.  But the movie itself WAS NOT FUNNY, nor was it good.",1066780800,11,853,4.327044025157233

Almost every old cowboy movie is slow paced, ""My name is Nobody"" isn't any different but it's thoughtfully and very detailed. The story is great and has a great ending. The movie is both funny and serious.. mostly serious.
Of course the soundtrack of this movie is, to my opinion still unmatched by Ennio Morricone.. very moving stuff which really ties into the old west era.
Enjoy the movie!",1049932800,,519,4.360824742268041
5644640,5,B00BLNDRKK,"I have seen many comedy westerns including Cat Ballou, Blazing Saddles, and City Slickers. None have made me laugh harder than ""My Name is Nobody"". Henry Fonda plays a retiring gunfighter, Jack Beauregard, for the law while Terence Hill plays a comedic young gunfighter, Nobody, for good. His methods are quite different and should keep you in stitches more than once. The scenes at the Circus can't be beat. Although he is proficient with a gun, you never see him kill anybody to make his point. Did I mention the musical score by Ennio Morricone is great? As mentioned in a good review, laurie's boomer views, you can play just the soundtrack. I love Morricone's happy go lucky intro song , My Name is Nobody, and all the western themes that dramatize the scenes with Beauregard. I do hope this will be released on DVD in the US and for a lower price. The import quality lacks a little to be desired so I am hoping for a better transfer of the master in the future. The WHAM! version menu is overly red and the Bio has Henry Ford instead of Fonda as the name, but the bio is correct. The DVD is decent quality with a only a few screen glitches and the sound is good. The occasional graininess can't be helped since the original VHS quality was no better and probably the master print wasn't sharp. I don't regret getting the DVD since this is a great movie and my VHS is wearing out.

I originally wrote this review in 2003, it is now 2014 and I still find this to be one of my favorite Westerns of all time. I first saw this movie on TV while at my closest friends house around 1978. Back then you couldn't buy it on VHS Tape and you could only record it if you had lots of money for a VCR recorder. So happened he had one. Now it's on DVD, Blu Ray, and Digital. The movie continues to entertain most that see it, and fortunately you can get a good copy on DVD now. I notice from some reviews that some people just don't get the humor.  Quentin Tarantino did, just look at Kill Bill 2. Kill Bill 2 had the same kind of over the top wacky humor with a Spaghetti Western style blended into a modern drama. Sergio Leone did My Name Is Nobody in a similar style over forty years ago. This movie was meant to be serious and silly at the same time and it has a great moral tale to boot. I enjoy most Spaghetti Westerns and I loved those with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, but this movie is a nice cross of those with more wacky comedy. By the way this movie was made in 1973, not 2005.

But the problems I have are in the encoding job that was done.

5644642,3,B00BLNDRKK,"Truly, this movie has inspired moments. Indeed, the premise itself--America (Henry Fonda as archetypal American Western cowboy hero, Frank Beauregard) bidding farewell to a genre, moving aside to the ""new generation"" of Euro-Western heroes (typifed by Terence Hill's wise-beyond-his-years wiseacre ""Nobody"" figure)--is inspiring. Fonda's steely (albeit near-sighted) blues are the perfect contrast to the carnivalesque clownishness of Hill--and the film's meta-commentary on mythmaking vs. reality (and a very serious message about the need for heroes for the rest of us to believe in, even if those individuals called upon are looking for anything but a heroic role!) is surprisingly profound. But Valeri Tonino's erratic direction often slows things down to a glacier-like pace--and, unfortunately, it's Hill's mugging that too often contributes to this down-time. Fonda's performance, however, is a little gem--a wistful counterpoint to his Wyatt Earp of Ford's ""Clementine."" When he sails off into the sunset, leaving Nobody behind to bring the West into the 20th century (the film takes place in 1899), our hearts go with him--and we were certainly glad we went along for the ride. A light-hearted (but at times sentimental) Ennio Moriccone score (complete with ironic quotations from Richard Wagner) adds to the overall fun. Nowhere near as good as it could--or perhaps should--have been (and the opening sequence, as legend has it directed by Leone himself, hints at just how good it really *might* have been under Leone's own direction), but it's quite unlike most other Westerns of *any* time period.

I had pampered my VHS thinking that I would never see such an obscure, yet thoroughly enjoyable film in a more permanent format.  This film set an artistic standard that I cannot say has ever been matched in a western.  Anyone seeking a serious gun-slinging film might be disappointed to find this film saturated with comedy.  But don't let that deter you!  Sergio Leoni has solidly proven himself as adept at comedy as action/drama.  The widescreen format of the DVD allows you to catch some of the otherwise cropped-out facial expressions of by-standers in the film, which is a small but vital part of what made this comedy so artistic. The remastered soundtrack really brings the disc alive, allowing the subtle background noises such as gasps, comments whispered among townsfolk, and the tooth grinding of an irate cowboy to be heard with crystal clarity.  There is not even a hint of an annoying hiss, which really surpised me, given the age of the soundtrack.  But background effects, though vital, were not the soul of this artistic endeavour.  It is as rootin'-tootin' a shootin' cowboy flick as any Eastwood movie Sergio ever produced.  Just imagine the subtle wit of Clint's characters taken to an abrupt extreme!  The plot is clever and somewhat sophisticated, immediately letting the viewer know the direction of the film but, as with any of his stories, shrouding the elements of how the plot could possibly be fulfilled until it actually is.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, western fan or not.  Don't watch it with expectations; just let it run its course and enjoy its tom-foolery.

5644648,5,B00BLNDRKK,"My most favorite movie of all time. Very under rated with an incredible performance by Henry Fonda and Terence Hill. The filming, to include the scenery and  the music is chilling. My copy of a VHS tape is so used and in such bad condition, this DVD edition is very welcome and displayed with pride. Share this movie with all who enjoy westerns, they will come away a fan of this movie",1006732800,3,385,4.347222222222222
5644649,5,B00BLNDRKK,"This is my favorite spaghetti western!  It is a hoot!  The basic elements of your Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns are there - the mysterious, gun-slinging stranger, the rough-edged characters, lots of shooting and violence... But the movie is a comedy, a spoof of spaghetti westerns, as well.  It is quite well done, with very good acting and an amusing plot that revolves around a ""mysterious stranger"" and his efforts to make his hero, Henry Fonda, go down in the history books.  The fellow's name is Nobody, and on that hangs the plot.  I have loved this movie since it came out, and have watched it numerous times over the last 20 years.  Enjoy!",1004313600,11,651,4.716814159292035
5644650,1,B00BLNDRKK,"Several things came to mind while watching...a)scenery is great; if you've never been to Mogollon, make a trip. b) Henry Fonda was a great actor and must have been blackmailed by Sergio Leone to appear in this mess. c) Leone was no doubt popular with investors for recycling everything from costumes to music on each of his music. d) the video quality was too damned good, if you ask me. e) The word ""Interminable"" came to me several times. This is one of those movies better with the sound off. If you want a western, watch any of John Ford's, Ulzana's Raid, Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, or the Magnificent Seven. Nuff said.",998179200,6,631,4.543859649122807
5644651,4,B00BLNDRKK,"Great movie! But... The quality of the video recording was quite annoying! There has to be a better one out there somewhere. I pray when it comes out on DVD that it's in letterbox. I've seen this flick on tv and it seems that this vhs recording was super zoomed when formatted. Most of the best scene in the movie, where Fonda has his big showdown, is lost ""side to side"". If your a big Terence Hill fan and your ""jonsing"" for this movie then click away otherwise wait for the remastered DVD edition.",989193600,5,500,4.329787234042553
5644652,3,B00BLNDRKK,"One of my all-time favorites, and rather hard to find in Europe (odd, as it is countries like Germany where the Italian spaghetti-western genre has enjoyed greatest succes). Inserting the tape into my VCR, I was really looking forward to seeing this gem again after quite a few years, but I was sourly disppointed at the very poor quality of this particular recording.  Though there are worse, this was clearly below standard, and I'm surprised it's not been mentioned more often in the reviews below. 5 stars for the film, 2 for the recording",987897600,5,543,4.776595744680851
5644653,4,B00BLNDRKK,"Was looking for this video for years. I needed it since it's one of my all times favorite. You gotta have it too. This is Leone's masterpiece in its kind: all the elements of the spaghetti western plus the comedy part. Can't beat that.  Sure, I bought it. Only thing is, it's a shame to have THAT specific edition in my collection. It is stuffed with mistakes and the cover is totally lame. First, it has written on it the cast from another Leone's movie with Quebec actor Robert Charlebois(wich they even spelled Charlesbois and that you guys at Amazon should carry). Also,they'd better have sticked to the groovy original hand drawn cover of Nobody and his red sock with a hole in it...Finally, the opening sequence is the original one written in italian. In one word, if you are looking for the famous MY NAME IS NOBODY, this is it. Go for it but if you are a maniac like me you can expect a little deception from this particular edition. Very sloppy one. If you're the average movie collector and are only looking for the content, it'll do for you.
What a great movie....",976406400,13,1075,4.48469387755102

5644655,4,B00BLNDRKK,"At the risk of sounding like a pretentious academic at a film school this movie works on a couple of different levels. Sergio Leone's movies always did. This movie is a satirical take not only on the Sphaghetti Western but  also on many of the westerns being made in the late sixties and early  seventies. Not by chance is this movie set in 1899 - the end of the  Nineteenth century. Here you have the young man who has been raised on a  steady diet of stories about his hero and his exploits against impossible  odds. Now his hero is old and simply wants to quit while he can still enjoy  his retirement. The frontier is just a memory and he wants to go. The young  man won't let him - he's a legend and by god he'll go out like he lived -  in a blaze of glory. Like so many of Leone's movies this little oddball  comedy western is actually a take on the end of an era, memories, myth and  reality. Yes it is funny with a couple really great comedic setpieces. The  soundtrack by Morricone is both stirring and wacky. And it is very free  with historical and technical details, but who cares? This isn't a  documentary it's a movie about how we make myths out of life. And if you  think that I've made too much out of this movie then you just made my point  about this movie. See it and then decide. I suppose this is a sterotype but  this strange, moody and romantic genere could only have come out of Italy",954547200,52,1409,4.182156133828996
5644656,5,B00BLNDRKK,"Good and evil are clearly defined (hill and the wild bunch) with the shade of grey being fonda. It is a truly wonderful treat to watch hill manipulate fonda into a showdown with the wild bunch (""You will..."") It  seems the movie goes full circle, and I still remember the first time I  watched it, hoping to see who would take the place of the new gunslinger to  bother Hill. Also, the little jokes are wonderful (""Sam Peckinpah.  Thats a beautiful name in navajo."") I would have given it 10 stars if  able...",952905600,2,509,4.43010752688172

The smooth cut, cinematography and switching from one to the other scene in similar vignets  hit me at the time and still works. Of course Ennio Morricone's music tops  it all off.
