3876390,5,B002997SKK,"I really enjoyed this dvd because it had two really great movies on it.  The first one, The Batman/Superman movie has Lex Luthor team-up with the Joker in order to kill Superman, and with the Joker in Metropolis you just know Batman is coming on over.  It is really entertaining to see how these two heroes meet and act towards one another.  I don't want to ruin it for those who have yet to see it, but it does get quite interesting even though the whole time you already know who's going to win.  The Batman vs. Dracula is the second movie and my favorite of the two.  Even though The Batman animated series was made alot more kid friendly than the original, this movie still found a way to keep me interested.  Basically the movie has Dracula awaken in Gotham cemetary, because Penguin had to go and accidentally cut himself over the skeleton of Dracula, after this Dracula decides to make Gotham his new Transylvania by turning everyone into vampires.  As Batman investigates the disappearance of the ""lost ones"", which we know is everyone who's been turned, he encounters and battles some new members of Dracula's vampire army, and to make things worse for Bats an eyewitness who gets interviewed by Vicki Vale tells he saw a huge shadow of a bat, this causes Gotham P.D. to assume Batman is behind the disappearance of the ""lost ones"".  I also don't want to ruin this movie because it was so good.  I only have 2 complaints but the second isn't really a complaint.  First, I'm just not fond of double sided dvds because I have to worry about scratches more and second I thought the scene in The Batman vs Dracula were Bruce grabs a serving tray and lipstick from a woman then writes Alucard and then holds it up to the mirror to show us that Alucard spelt backwards is Dracula could have been left out.",1277337600,,1808,4.5015290519877675
3876391,5,B002997SKK,"This is  a compilation DVD, one show on each side of the single disc. It combines two previously released animated Batman movies. First up is The Batman Superman Movie, originally released in 1998 to television. 61 minutes long. Worth the upgrade if you have the old VHS version due to the cleaner image and extras. The running sub-plot of this story was the undercurrent competition between the two superheroes over romancing Lois Lane, on Batmans's part as Bruce Wayne. This lead to the next sub-plot of the caped ones spying on each other to learn the others secret identity. All while the real reason to bring the boys together is due to the the fact that Lex Luthor and the Joker have joined forces.
Second feature is ""The Batman Vs. Dracula"" was released in 2005 near the start of the later animated series, ""The Batman"". Running time of 84 minutes. The Joker, The penguin, and Vicki Vale make an appearance.
These are both full-screen version, as animated when they were made for television.  Some pretty good extras on the DVD, including an interview with producer Bruce Timm for the first movie.
Other extras include:
Batmans Supercomputer
Data Files Probe the Dracula Legend
Interactive Gotham City Map, which in turn reveals Cool Making-Of Segments
Voices in Close-Up
Pop-Up Tricia and Interviews
How to Draw Batman
how to Draw Superman
The Jokers Challenge Game
Music Montage
The disc also has multiple language tracks and subtitles, (French, Spanish, and Portuguese) but on the first movie only.",1263600000,13,1508,4.956521739130435

8357623,5,B002997SKK,"With a title like that one would think Warner Bros is trying to cash in on the latest Hollywood vampire craze, but after watching the disc I gave it 5 stars it is well written, nicely act (voiced) I am slowly warming up to Rino Romano's Batman. The story concerns Count Dracula unwittingly revived by the Penguin what follow is a cat & mouse game between Batman & Dracula's intent of turning Gotham City's citizens into vampires thrown in The Joker along the way and there you have a have a solid film. The 2nd feature is actually 2 episodes from the Superman animated series co starring Superman & Batman vs Lex Luther & Joker, of course its always a joy to watch (listen)to Kevin Conroy's Batman anytime. If you are on the fence about it don't not at the low Amazon price $8.49 as of this writing.",1280102400,,799,4.405405405405405
