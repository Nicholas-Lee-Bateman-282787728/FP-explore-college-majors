8262194,5,B0016DLT3C,This is an excellent video and a must see for anyone who knows Aga Khan and for those who have no idea who Aga Khan is. No one can match this personality. An eye opener.,1220054400,4,169,3.857142857142857
8262195,5,B0016DLT3C,"What I found most interesting, and refreshing, about this film was the attention paid to the Aga Khan's relationship to the Ismailis, rather than focusing solely on theology. The focus on the story of Prince Karim allows for an informative and accessible means of learning more about both the Aga Khan himself and the tradition as a whole. The film is very well-organized and does a nice job of detailing the development and history of the Ismaili community, especially through the discussions from professors and other speakers. Overall, it is very easy to follow while simultaneously raising complex discussions.",1206316800,8,614,5.212121212121212
