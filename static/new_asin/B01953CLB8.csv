8743971,5,B01953CLB8,GREAT REVIEW,1477267200,,12,5.5
8743972,5,B01953CLB8,"""Red touches black, friend to Jack"" and ""Red touches yellow could kill a fellow"" is a rhyme that could save you your life when it comes to scarlet kingsnake, the faker, vs. the real killer in certain neck of the wood on this planet since yellow means danger unlike the lighter color fellow, the faker, the scarlet kingsnake. This is one informative, fun, educational documentary about many creatures in action that you will get to witness with many different scientists all over the world who will explain how each specific specie tries to become a hunter for their next meal while avoid being hunted. Amazing amount of information in this BBC documentary series. Watch it with your kids while introducing them to the wild. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1455408000,3,744,4.866141732283465
