8164261,5,B000LV64Q2,This is not NFL Film quality but it's close.  Most college DVD's lack in-depth shots and just replay what I already viewed on TV or SportsCenter.  This is unique in that it showed the bench and locker room before and after the game.,1184976000,2,232,4.372093023255814
8164262,5,B000LV64Q2,"Interesting DVD, would like to see a little more behind the scenes footage of Chris Leak and Dallas Baker -- but it is a must for any true Gator fan.",1173312000,5,149,4.0
8164263,5,B000LV64Q2,"Being from Pennsylvania, I am the last person you would suspect to be a Gator's fan.  I wasn't ""born into it"" like so many other satellite fans.  It all started with a hat.  I remember being at a Modell's in Philadelphia and looking for one that I liked, and the hat that caught my eye happened to be that of the Florida Gators.  Needless to say, I bought the thing and I think after awhile the Gator Logo must have soaked into my head and I became a Gator fan.  This was of course right around the 1996 year when they won the championship with Spurrier and Wuerffel - that also may have had something to do with it.

What I am trying to say, in so many words, is that this DVD caters to the Gator Gurus out there.  It follows the team through the entire season giving highlights of some of the biggest moments this year in the Swamp and on the road.  The first 2-3 minutes of the DVD were absolutely amazing.

I really liked some of the special features on the DVD as well.  I was particularly fond of the feature ""Final Thoughts From Urban Meyer"" because I have not seen that interview before.  Also the other segments of the ""Season's Biggest"" which included Special Teams plays, Defensive plays and best Touchdowns were exceptionally well done - my favorite being the Defensive.  The ""Behind the Scenes at Florida Football"" segment was also very nice - I usually don't get to see that kind of stuff out here in Philly (no GatorZone channel) and I would imagine that Gator fans everywhere would feel the same.

The DVD provided a lot of good surprises that typical season-in-review movies usually lack.  If you are a loyal Gator's fan, then this DVD is definitely for you.",1171324800,10,1675,4.431372549019608
