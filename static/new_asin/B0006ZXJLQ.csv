After Marik and Bakura duel in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Gi-Oh-Battle-City-Duels-Showdown-in-the-Shadows/dp/B00069FKR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Gi Oh - Battle City Duels - Showdown in the Shadows</a>, Kaiba heads off to Alcatraz for the second part of the Battle City finals.  However, on their way there, the gang gets trapped in a Virtual World were they must face Kaiba's stepbrother Noah and the Big Five from the ""LEGENDARY HEROES"" 3 episode adventure from Season 1 (you know, when Kaiba's workers trapped him inside a video game...)  Everyone (even Tea, Tristan, and Duke) had to duel in the Virtual World in order to escape, and when everyone defeats the Big Five and Yugi defeats Noah and Kaiba defeats the real villain behind it all (which I'm not going to say who it is in case you want to watch it online or something), the Battle City finals begin! (By the way, there is a small flashback of the Noah episodes in the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Gi-Oh-Season-3-Vol-5-The-Final-Face-Off/dp/B0009MAO6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu-Gi-Oh!: Season 3, Vol. 5 - The Final Face-Off</a>).

So, here are the episodes included in this DVD:

122. Back to Battle City: Part I
123. Back to Battle City: Part II
124. Back to Battle City: Part III
125. The Darkness Returns: Part I

What you'll see on this DVD is basically that the quarter-finals are over and the semi-finals have begun.  Kaiba organizes a four-way duel where it is Yugi vs. Kaiba vs. Marik vs. Joey!  No teams!  No double duels!  Everyone is everyone's opponent!  The first two duelists to loose won't be disqualiifed...they'll just be the first to face each other off in the first duel of real semi-finals.  The two duelists to win this four-way duel will duel each other in the second duel of the semi-finals.  THE DARKNESS RETURNS: PART I is already the first official duel of the semi-finals.  Who will it be?  Yugi and Kaiba? Yugi and Joey? Yugi and Marik? Kaiba and Joey? Kaiba and Marik? or Marik and Joey?  This is a must-watch for any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan!

8044240,4,B0006ZXJLQ,"Obviously this is a must see for anyone following the YuGiOh! series as this is the begining of the final finals leading up to the big finish where Yugi gets all the Egyptian God cards.

The four way duel is entertaining and it's nice to see Joey stand up for himself and try to be his own man...or duelist.",1125964800,,307,4.203389830508475
8044241,5,B0006ZXJLQ,"The correct Episode titles are:
1.  Back to Battle City - Part 1
2.  Back to Battle City - Part 2
3.  Back to Battle City - Part 3
4.  Return of the Darkness - Part 1
I just wish that Funimation will not restrict viewers from skipping the lengthy commercials before you can actually get to the Main Menu.  It's a great DVD.",1113350400,2,323,3.984375
