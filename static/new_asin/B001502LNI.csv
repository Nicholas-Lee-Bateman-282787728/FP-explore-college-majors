3136579,4,B001502LNI,"After weathering a plethora of FZ tributes, some of which are rather good but sometimes sloppy and self-indulgent, many of us fans were resigned to the fact that the man who left on his final tour in the early 90s was the only presence who could truly deliver this very particular musical content. Whether it was a Euro jazz group, a virtuoso chamber ensemble, or reunion of veteran band members, respectful and well-intentioned as it was, it all just seemed to come across as lip service. Something was missing.

After viewing this filmed performance of ZPZ, one may realize that what was missing was blood. Though Dweezil doesn't bleed in quite the same way as father Frank, it is apparent that here is the man who immersed himself in the music (not many others could have the same opportunity) to the degree where he could take it on the road and deliver what really feels like a Zappa concert. Not exactly 100%, but closer than anyone in this generation will experience elsewhere.

And that is the point. Dweezil's mission has been to reintroduce the inimitable music of Frank Zappa to a younger demographic starved for alternatives to the mind-numbingly insipid consumer sock stuffers that pass for popular music in this day and age. With little to compare it to, Zappa's music can't be anything but fresh, a challenging listen but always entertaining. To do this Dweezil has assembled an enthusiastic ensemble that comes close to looking like a group Frank would have hand picked. Scheila Gonzales in particular (a music teacher at a high school in Simi Valley of all places), who accompanies herself on keyboard while improvising on sax, is someone to watch for, both in this show and her future career. Percussionist Billy Hulting nicely fills the void left in the absence of Ruth Underwood. All players of this really difficult material not only pull it off, but make it look really fun. Dweezil himself is both participant and observer onstage: at no point does he attempt to BE Frank, his playing style is his own when he improvs (more fluid and high register), and he has wisely avoided presenting songs like Dinah Moe Hum, TTs & Beer, Bobby Brown Goes Down, etc., because it's just not who Dweezil is and he didn't want the material to seem ""like a cheap imitation"".

Of course veteran performer Napoleon Murphy Brock is more than up to the task of putting that ""snarky"" personality into his vocal performance, and as such takes on a gargantuan task of singing most of the songs and making them sound like the real deal, along with the meticulously researched arrangements, obviously taken note-for-note from the original recordings. Another very welcome guest presence is Terry Bozzio, whom many consider the greatest drummer who ever worked with Frank. The camera dawdles lovingly over his considerable percussive kit, which resembles a cross between a space shuttle console and a sea anemone. And the songs ""I'm So Cute"", ""Trying to Grow a Chin"" and the epic ""Punky's Whips"" (best recorded performance of this IMHO) are only included as only Bozzio can deliver. ""You know, TECHNICALLY,"" he assures the audience, ""I'm still alive."" That's an understatement.

And as if that weren't enough, Dweezil brings in Steve Vai, the man who actually taught him to play guitar (dad was too busy I guess, and didn't want to ""work"" while with family). As you can imagine, much of this generous show's second half is devoted to some scorching guitar battles, particularly on ""Montana"", ""Zomby Woof"" and ""Trouble Every Day"". Earlier on, we are treated to a stunning improv section in ""Pound for a Brown"", where Dweezil sheds his guitar and conducts the band with a series of secret hand signals. This is one of the more magical moments when you KNOW you're witnessing a genuine Zappa concert.

Don't approach this video expecting a sort of nostalgic experience.... unless you define ""nostalgia"" as a time in the past, where artists had the unmitigated audacity to intrude upon rock audiences with truly exciting, challenging, thought-provoking and perversely fun music. It's still there, and will continue to be so, as Dweezil Zappa has stated his intention to continue the legacy of his extraordinary father's music.... minus the Winstons, of course. DZ may not have the same edge as FZ did, though this could work in favor of the music, which may have not enjoyed sufficient reach in the past due to how many felt about Frank's personality. Whatever. To paraphrase the composer (who refuses to die): Zappa isn't dead, he just smells younger.

Let go of any preconceptions, and enjoy a smashing delivery of Zappa music as it sounds today.",1210464000,83,4639,4.903184713375796
3136580,5,B001502LNI,"When I first heard about the ZPZ project I admit I was a bit more that skeptical.

This DVD/CD combo more than dispels any apprehension.
The band is beyond top-notch. Each and every one of these musicians demonstrates a mind-boggling level of skill and most importantly, passion for these performances. And it's great to see Napoleon Murphy Brock having such a great time AND holding his own with a band all (?) young enough to be his children. I hate that he's not still touring with them.

The song selections are great and the execution is perfect. On the DVD, the camera work is really good there are a lot of quick cuts, but let's face it, with Frank's music to follow the action a lot of cuts are really needed.

Are there any other quibbles? Sure. (I still get annoyed with Steve Vai's 'stunt guitar') In the long run, the quality and the overall care put into this package really stands out.",1210118400,12,899,4.5030674846625764
3136581,5,B001502LNI,"This is the most amazing concert DVD I've seen since King Crimson's ""Eyes Wide Open"" from 2003.  The sound is great and the performance phenomenal.  If you enjoy watching top-notch musicians going at it then this is for you.  The only down-side is the few songs that Terry Bozzio sings at the end of disc 1.  It's kind of lame.  But the rest is sublime in my opinion.  I watched it all weekend.  Inca Roads, Montana.  All too cool and well done.  It rocks.  Trust me!",1210032000,3,467,4.325581395348837
3136582,5,B001502LNI,"Watched all of this, both discs, last night. All of it was extraordinarily excellent.
Me and my fellow big Zappa friend sat there watching this and repeatedly remarked how excellent it all was, frequently saying it was just, JUST shy of the old man's bands himself. Extraordinarily close.
Impossible reproductions: check.
Blinding fast and accurate mallot and vibes play: check.
Incredible sax solo from multi-talented Scheila Gonzalez: check.
Dweezil doing his father proud in the guitar solo dept.: check.
With Napoleon Murphy Brock singing much of the lead vocals along with his on-stage spirited personality there comes an air of authenticity that Zappa fans want. Terry Bozzio's contribution was a real treat.
The only thing I missed was Frank's patented unique voice on songs like Cosmic Debris, I'm The Slime and Trouble Comin Every Day et al.
Dweezil gives a heartfelt thank you to all the fans at the show(filmed in Portland and Seattle) for supporting his father's music.
Also the disc concluding interview with Dweezil describes the coming together of this project and of this band.
Not a Frank Zappa and band live performance but I swear there is a hair's width of difference between the two.",1209859200,23,1204,5.085858585858586

SO I BOUGHT IT AND TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.I GOT THRU THE FIST DISC (VERY LONG) AND WAS OVERWHELMED AT THE INCREDIBLE MUSIC THIS GROUP OF MUSICIANS PUT DOWN.IT WAS AS CLOSE TO THE OLD STUFF AS YOU WILL EVER SEE.TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIRST DISC THEY BROUGHT OUT A GUY NAMED TERRY BOZZIO FOR A COUPLE SONGS.THATS WHEN I STARTED LOSING INTEREST.JUST BECAUSE HE PLAYED WITH FRANK IN THE EARLY DAYS HE JUST DIDN'T FIT IN ON THIS DVD.
THE SECOND DISC STARTS OFF WITH HIM DOING ""BLACK PAGE"" A CHALLENGE TO ANY MUSICIANS TO DUPLICATE.THATS WHEN I STARTED TO DRIFT INTO OBLIVION
WITH SENSORY OVERLOAD.AFTER ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES I'D HAD ENOUGH AND STOPPED.I'M SURE THE REST OF THE DVD IS OF STELLAR QUALITY BUT I PROBLEY WON'T REVISIT IT.
ANOTHER ITEM THAT HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME WITH CONCERT DVD'S IS THE BLENDING OF 2 OR MORE SHOWS TO CREATE 1 GREAT SHOW.WHO CARES ABOUT AN OCCASIONAL BAD SONG OR NOTE. I THINK IT ADDS ENHANCEMENT TO THE WHOLE SHOW. AFTER ALL,  HOW MANY PERFECT CONCERTS HAVE YOU SEEN? AT THE END OF THE FIRST DISC DWEEZIL CHANGES CLOTHES AND THEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND DISC HE CHANGES BACK AGAIN. NOTHING IS MENTIONED IN THE LINER NOTES ABOUT THIS CONCERT BEING 2 DIFFERENT SHOWS.
OVERALL I WOULD SAY THAT THIS DVD IS VERY GOOD BUT UNLESS YOU'RE A HARD HARD CORE ZAPPA FAN YOU'LL PROBLEY WATCH THIS DVD ONCE AND PUT IT AWAY.I GIVE DWEEZIL HIGH CREDIT FOR UNDERTAKING THIS PROJECT IN TRIBUTE TO HIS FATHERS MUSIC.

When I discovered Frank Zappa's music, he was no longer touring so I never had a chance to see him perform.  I saw the ZPZ tour in '06 and '07, and have my ticket for this summer's tour.  Led by Dweezil Zappa, an incredible guitarist, this group is made up of absolutely top-notch musicians.  Each time I saw them I was blown away by their musicianship, and continue to be blown away each time I watch the DVD.  Their reproduction of FZ's music is nearly flawless.

I went to see these guys last year, and don't let the fact that Frank is not playing with them put you off.  It was AMAZING! It was like going to see a Zappa's greatest hits show.
I have seen Frank twice live, and although I am a HUGE fan of his work,  in my humble opinion there is a lot of detrius that you have to sit through, to get to the good bits.  This show and disc set contained everything that I ever wanted to hear live.

3136587,5,B001502LNI,"Dweezil Zappa had each and every core member of the Zappa Plays Zappa ensemble study the actual arrangements that have been chosen for these performances. Sometimes it's a well documented Frank Zappa studio version, sometimes a well documented FZ tour version taken from 30 years of touring and sometimes it's an obscure version few have heard but exists in FZs massive vault that is managed by his family.

Dweezil Zappa, his Zappa Plays Zappa Core Band and Special Guests(Steve Vai, Terry Bozzio & Napoleon Murphy Brock) get the tone colors of each particular composition giving as much respect to the composers intent as possible.

3136634,5,B001502LNI,"Just over a dozen years ago, I saw Band From Utopia live in Chicago.  They were a Frank Zappa tribute band, composed of ex-sidemen from various incarnations of Frank Zappa's touring bands.  They were quite good, but I have to say, the performances captured on Zappa Plays Zappa absolutely blow them out of the water!  Dweezil has assembled an amazingly talented band, and when you add Napoleon Murphy Brock, Steve Vai, and Terry Bozzio to the mix, the combination is musical DYNAMITE!

Brock is in fine form.  Here's a guy who toured with Zappa back in the 70s with one of the more talented lineups of Frank's band.  He's back with a vengeance, clearly enjoying every minute of it.  ""The Torture Never Stops"" on Disc 2 was a standout song for me, as Brock does lead vocals and tortured screams.  Dweezil's guitar solo in ""Torture"" is brilliant as well, and the number is absolutely captivating.

Just about every track on this DVD is a winner, but a few more standouts include: ""Trouble Every Day"" (an extravaganza of guitar solos, sax solos, drum solos, and band magic);""Punkys Whips"" (a Terry Bozzio fiesta);""Zomby Woof"" (featuring an over-the-top Vai solo);""Pound for a Brown"" (one of Zappa's most incredible instrumental pieces; and ""Montana"" (a song I've always considered one of the best combinations of Zappa's comedy and musical complexity).

3136638,5,B001502LNI,"You have to respect Dweezil's heartfelt motivation to mount a tour profiling the music of his father. Dweezil states he took two years off just to learn the pieces and I believe it. To state that Frank Zappa's material is difficult to perform is an understatement. Frank's bands all required the most talented of musicians, each of whom had enormous respect for his farsighted compositional talent and brilliant musicianship.

What we have here is Dweezil's approach to a Zappa-inspired evening of music. The music is outstanding and so are the performances. Many of the pieces are metered a little slower than Zappa performed them during his day, but keep in mind the complexity of the music. During Zappa's tours his musicians lived and breathed the music and Zappa would often push the envelope to stretch their abilities. As Zappa's tours progressed and his musicians became more proficient with the material, the tempos would accelerate. Dweezil chose to approach some of these pieces at a slower tempo and it's only speculation as to whether this was a stylistic decision or a decision based out of necessity to ensure a clean performance.

One thing I really respect while watching these performances is how Dweezil lets the music speak for itself. He doesn't get into physical or facial grinding while performing. He stands and plays, just as his father did. Most of the time, even when he's shredding, his face and stance are relaxed. He practices economy of motion while playing; he moves what's necessary only when necessary. I respect this.

The two guest performers during the latter part of the performance are former Zappa alumni, guitarist Steve Vai and drummer Terry Bozzio, both of whom are prodigious masters at their instrument. Both musicians provide fabulous performances and are allowed time to show off their talents, but this DVD is really about the music. The DVD doesn't focus too much on Steve's playing, although he takes a number of outstanding solos. Terry is provided a lengthy drum solo towards the end of the performance and the encore culminates in a trading of licks between Dweezil and Steve and eventually other band members.

What makes this DVD really stand out is it's not a DVD only Zappa fans can appreciate. My wife came over from China two years ago and has never heard of Frank Zappa or seen any of the musicians on the DVD. She sat with me for two hours carefully watching every song, asking questions about the musicians and the music, and this provided a great opportunity for me to teach her about this brilliant genius named Frank Zappa who gave such a wide-ranging gift to the world through his music. At the end of the DVD she said to me, ""Whaaa! I like this man... His music very good!""

I think this is what Dweezil hoped to achieve--to preserve Frank's music and memory for future generations to discover and enjoy. Dweezil expresses this sentiment to the crowd through tears of respect and joy. You can see the love and respect he has for his father.

It really goes to show, while Frank may no longer be with us, his music really does live on. Dweezil's homage on this DVD is a testiment that that.",1277337600,,3156,4.792279411764706

3136640,5,B001502LNI,"I'm very impressed with Frank's boy. He takes this very seriously and presents Franks music with all the respect it deserves. Nice touch to have Vai, Bozzio, and Brock on board to lend authenticity to some of the key songs that featured them back in the day. In the interview that Dweezil does in the Bonus section, he says that there are some songs that he won't do because the vocal stamp that Frank put on them make them impossible to recreate. I think that's a smart move because there was a song or two in this concert where Frank had minor vocal parts in the original that seemed a bit off here. They could have used digital processing to deepen the tone to more closely resemble Franks voice but they didn't. There was a point where Brock uses two mics, one with a squeeky high tone and reverb, so they certainly could have gone the other way too. I still give this 5 stars because everything else is Top Notch.
There's three songs that Frank didn't want anyone to play except Dweezil - Watermelon In Easter Hay, Zoot Allures and Black Napkins. Dweezil did do Black Napkins in this show and said that there was a song that he couldn't do because it was too emotional. I'm guessing it's Watermelon In Easter Hay. I love that song and it always brings a tear to my eye when hearing Frank do it. I hope that someday Dweezil will perform this.",1276387200,,1346,4.388

The members of the band are great musically- I wish they would freak out just a bit more ( just an opinion ). The fan pack is the Bomb because you get the cd's as well as just the concert dvds- good for the ol ipod!

Seeing how his son (I had no clue how good he is himself) and other musicians perform Frank's characteristic, sometimes totally incoherent, a-rhythmic and full of sudden twists and unexpected sounds is a different experience. What a great effort and amazing musicianship. Just watch Steve Vai guitar ""conversations"" with Dweezil, or phenomenal Scheila Gonzalez playing on sax, keys and singing at the same time!!

3136644,5,B001502LNI,"You have several options with this first 2006 Zappa Plays Zappa Tour (actually recorded over two nights - Portland and Seattle - at the end of the tour), just the CD (1 select disc), just the DVD (2 disc) or the 5 disc Fan Pak combination presented here (2 DVDs and 3 CDs).

Firstly and mostly it's important to know this was a great concert (I was at the Seattle show). The core band (Zappa and Travers, Griffin, Kime, Arntz, Gonzales and Hulting) are mostly young (Dweezil appears to be the oldest at 37) and competent musicians. They also appear to be having a great time playing the stuff. The special guests from various FZ bands (Vai, Bozzio and Brock) add a sense of depth and weight to the group and do a great job of bringing some of the old Zappa flavor to the performances. Nepoleon for me was a special treat to see/hear. He is alive and all over the place with his singing, acting, dancing and playing. On the DVD Bozzio is pretty fun to watch in his drumship, and Vai delightfully dramatic and fluid with his illuminated frets.

The two venues are quite different. Portland's Aladdin Theatre is fairly intimate - and the crowd relaxed (it was 12/21, Frank's 65th B-day) The Paramount in Seattle was bigger and stiffer (although the crowd appreciatively on their feet for multiple ovations). But i remember the show going on for close to 4 hours - that may be an exageration but it was an abundant offering none-the-less, and the filming production was extensive (12 cameras!), and the encores endless. I also remember thinking about half way through the show (probably during the amazing ""Pound for a Brown"", once the band was really warmed up and relaxed) how damn good they were. It was almost as good as watching FZ...(and maybe even more consistent). Production value and quality (recording, filming, editing and packaging) is of course excellent.

The three discs of music are pretty much the same songs as on the DVD - a mixture of the two shows, leaning heavily on the Seattle show.

I think all these things almost three years after those recording because I just saw them play in Spokane, and my appreciation is perhaps stronger than ever. The venue was smaller, the core band similar (minus Arntz on extra keyboards and horn, but with the addition of singer Ben Thomas), and the show just over 2 hours long (less extended versions)... but at about half way through the show I again noticed they were finally energized, relaxed and warmed up and playing really well. When Dweezil lit out into one of the many extended solos I had the feeling I was listening to Zappa play. And I was. I left in a warm glow (after all, there was a nice new variety of songs being performed, and I got to share it with my 14 yr old daughter who can't get enough of FZ's music), marveling what it must be like for Dweezil to be learning about his father from the inside out. He seems pretty blown away by it still.

I'm really glad the Zappa tribute band is still on the road. I'll gladly see them again. They are the ultimate ""tribute band"", like a string quartet that makes a career out of covering Mozart, serious musicians dedicated to their project. And it's nice to see them playing more in their own way (no special old guests, some of the songs even sounding a bit unlike FZ, and more like Dweezil's shredder Van Halen style, and no attempt by Dweezil to imitate his father's conducting style), and digging deeper into the vast repertoire. Definitely check them out when they come your way, but also get this recording to see them in full glory.",1259884800,2,3556,4.55868544600939

3136649,5,B001502LNI,"This is not a cover band for Frank's work - not even close. It's quickly apparent that Dweezil is his father's son - and then some. Frank was a cruel taskmaster when it came to musicians, but it was from the crucible of Frank's work that the careers of Steve Vai, Terry Bozio and many others were launched.

Dweezil's recreation is in every respect a masterful construct and interpretation of his father's music. And all this without cheapening or diminishing what Frank accomplished in any way. In fact, quite the opposite! This work is so engaging that you (like me) may find your jaw firmly stuck to your coffee table as you spend hours mesmerized by the astounding accomplishment of what Dweezil has done. If Frank could see this, he might just soil himself.

First of all, Dweezil is an accomplished guitarist in his own right, holding up just fine to bouts of dueling guitars with Steve Vai during Steve's special guest appearances. But make no mistake, the footage of Steve is alone worth the price of this DVD.

Scheila Gonzalez deserves special recognition as her work on Sax could very well just rip your face right off! She is AMAZING!

Is this work Frank? Well yes and no. You might better say that it is Frank's work squared! In other words, Dweezil takes it well beyond the next level.

There is just so much astounding material here that you've just got to see it for yourself. Buy this DVD, you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",1243123200,,1436,4.6156862745098035

3136675,4,B001502LNI,"I've been a Frank Zappa fan since high school, when a friend gave me a mix tape. We often lament that this modern composer died before we could see him in concert. So when Zappa Plays Zappa came around, we zipped up to Portland in the middle of a December rainstorm with slim wallets and wobbly crutches.

That's the only way to go in Oregon. Especially for a 65th birthday concert being recorded for a commercial release! Now it's your turn to enjoy Frank with the ZPZ fan pack.

The rock maestro left the building in 1993, but his son Dweezil carries on the legacy. Joined by Joe Travers, the vault-meister responsible for Frank's master-tapes, ZPZ includes a rotating guest list of Zappa alumni. For taped shows in Portland and Seattle, this meant vocalist vet Napoleon Murphy Brock, drum-master Terry Bozzio, and guitar god Steve Vai.

You can experience them in several different versions:

>2 DVD set--the core package
>1 or 2 disc CD
>The most expensive 2 DVD/3CD fan pak.

The shows focuses on cuts from the mid-to late 1970's with a few Sixties classics thrown in. More pop and less socio-political, it's a crowd and company-pleasing performance.

For the most part, ZPZ sounds to me like it is interpreting Frank's music directly from the discography, with little in the way of new flourishes or rearrangements. Right down to the Don Pardo impersonation by Billy Hulting on ""I'm the Slime"". However, they make a fair amount of solo improvs and lyrical ad-libs. Also, it's their own live performance--no samples slipped in that I can tell (aside from effects like the wind in ""Don't Eat the Yellow Snow""). That matches my memory of the show.

Unfortunately, the same disability which gave us head-of-the-line entry also put my friend at the back of the audience (the bouncers said his crutches were a crowd hazard). Aside from cheating us out of front row seating and video immortality, I had trouble seeing certain performances.

Fortunately, the DVD footage offers a good view. Some sound and visual edits are a little awkward or nonsensical, but the overall presentation alternates between strategic and tactical shots of the band. The former lets you see how they play together, holding or jumping between members within a given section of music. The latter pays attention to hands, sticks, and lips during notable passages. Dweezil also uses a Fret Cam to showcase his licks. Occasional split screens also let the viewer compare different members during the passage, with the camera centered on the performance.

But don't mistake this for an instructional video. Ya got plenty of spins, jumps, pans `n' zooms to stimulate your eyes. As others have pointed out, there's never a moment when the picture is facing the wrong way or too tricked out with effects to see what is going on. Sometimes you get a mike stand blocking someone's face, or a camera craning around the frame, but nothing that spoils a moment.

That said, most of the footage comes from the Seattle show.

The Roseland is what the liner notes charitably call ""a very rock `n' roll looking venue""--with a low ceiling, lots of obstructive pylons and the standing crowd pushed close to the stage. Some of the more rockin' portions of the set come from this footage.

Seattle's Paramount, by comparison, looks open and bright. The crowd is neatly seated, the band elegantly framed onstage, and you can see right in the footage that camera operators had more room to operate. Especially for long shots, it makes sense. Plus, Frank Zappa had history here.

Most performances are taken wholly from one venue or the other. But ""Trouble Every Day"" cuts back and forth, and includes a guitar duel, saxophone duel, and drum duel in a 24-minute epic of sound.

The audio is coherent. No funky echoes, mike squeals, or muffling. You can hear the crowd when Dweezil wants you to hear it, and you can hear the music.

The CDs sound like slightly trimmed and remixed audio of the DVDs... adding ""Cheepnis"" and cranking up the drums a bit, but otherwise offering little variation. That's fine with me, because I'm tired of going to great shows that don't end up on disc at all. I'm gratified this program includes the Portland performances of ""Punky's Whips"" and ""Peaches En Regalia""--two of the few songs in the set from that long-ago mix tape. A good set list overall.

Overall, this is a good set for Zappa veterans and noobs alike. I was introduced directly to Frank's social works, like ""Bobby Brown Goes Down"" and ""Honey, Don't You Want a Man Like Me?"" in my status-avoiding days at the high school. But these cuts would probably scare off current generations, who sometime seem more like Bobby and Betty than ever before. The real gift of ZPZ is that it offers Frank's art through his more accessible and yet signature works.

Some fun stuff is still missing from the set. Such as Dweezil conducting the audience, the word of the night, or the Roseland singing ""Happy Birthday"" for Frank. Dweezil's video duet with Frank doesn't make it either.

""Cheepnis"", one of the Portland encores, is relegated to the Bonus features. That and a short interview with Dweezil are it for extras. Setup is limited to PCM Stereo and 5.1 English--no subtitles for the French or hearing impaired.

The box itself is a digipak in a cheap cardstock sleeve. But it looks sturdy enough, with the same width as two DVD cases, so it should do fine on your shelf. However, it uses those overlapping trays that force you to peel off a disc to reach one underneath.

That's okay. ZPZ offers a historic and well-documented show from the safety of your living room. No parking hassles on Burnside, no muggers or drug dealers lurking around the side streets, and no 70-mile drive on the I-5. Just you, your couch, and Zappa all the way, baby.",1237334400,8,5783,4.781344032096289

3136677,5,B001502LNI,"Everything is fantastic about this DVD set.  The performance, the song selection, the video, the filming, the editing and the audio.  It is one of the best jam bands I have heard.

I WAS AFRAID TO BUY THIS.  I thought it was going to be just another crappy tribute band type concert.  And I though it was going to be another one of these cheaply filmed and edited DVD's (like the ones by Dave Matthews or Roxie Music, with constant cuts and zooming in and out).

I WAS AMAZED AT HOW GOOD THIS WAS.  It is Dweezil Zappa playing his father's songs, but he makes them his own.  The band is really into it.  There is just some fantastic jamming throughout.  There are some amazing guitar solos by Zappa and Steve Vai.

This product comes in many different flavors.  There is a one disc CD.  There is a 2 disc CD.  There is this 2 disc DVD.  There is also a 3 CD and 3 DVD combination (maybe the best one to get because you can listen to the whole thing in your car, without having to first use your computer to rip the audio).  It is my only complaint about this.  I almost bought the single CD because I didn't know that there were more options available.

This is a three and a half hour concert that professionally filmed.  A great job was done in the filming and the editing.  The camera is focused on the right person at the right time.

The band is the Zappa Plays Zappa band.  They are currently touring (2009).  Once I saw this DVD, I really wanted to see the show, but it sold out quickly here in Santa Cruz.

For this concert, there are 3 guest stars.  Napoleon Murphy Broch plays during the whole concert.  He is like the second star, doing most of the singing and playing sax and flute.  (makes me wonder what the singing is like when he is not a guest).  Terry Bozzio plays on a number tracks half way through the show.  He sings on many of the songs he used to sing when he has with Frank Zappa.  And Steve Vai is there for about the last third of the concert.

The extras on the DVD are one song (Cheepnis) from another show and an interview with the Dweeze.",1234051200,,2069,4.188295165394402
3136678,5,B001502LNI,"I was fortunate enough to see the show in Portland, where I live, which was recorded on Frank Zappa's birthday.  There are only a few excerpts from that show on the DVD with the rest in Seattle which is by far a better and bigger concert hall, thus, probably the reason why they used most of that footage.  Regardless of this fact, this fan pack is a must have for any musician, true music lover, as well as a fan of Frank Zappa.  Dweezil has changed his style completely to emulate his father's playing and he has become quite the guitar vurtuoso.  The band is incredible and I consider them one of the best musical groups put together in a long time.  Yes this show is a long one but one doesn't notice if they are into it because there are so many great songs.  I read some other reviews where they didn't watch the entire DVD because of Terry Bozzio coming on stage to do some of the tunes Frank wrote for him to perform.  Terry is what us drummers refer to as the ""Drum God"".  He is phenominal.  Also what these reviewers failed to see not watching the entire show was Steve Via coming out and playing.  He is one of the best guitarist in the world and when he and Dweezil do the dueling guitar solo is a definite highlight.  One has to realize also that the show was filmed as is.  The band never takes a break, there are a couple individuals who may leave for a few moments, otherwise it is one song after another with the only gaps where Dweezil talks a little or introduces something.  This is a feat in itself considering Dweezil never leaves the stage for over three hours.  If you loved Frank's music, love the dense complexety of his music, and have an open mind, I highly recommend this DVD as being one of the best tributes to a musician to ever be released.  I have seen the tour the second time around this year, they performed all different songs, and will be back in Portland in Jan of 2009 where I get to see them again with a special VIP pass.  They promise to do different songs again.  In case you didn't know, Frank had produce and recorded over a 110 cds, a lot of them live recdordings, but there is so much music that Dweezil's band could tour for many years before having to repeat songs.  Hopefully they will release another DVD for those who don't get a chance to see them.  I give this one 100 stars.  I shall never grow tired of this one.",1228521600,5,2370,4.247767857142857
3136679,5,B001502LNI,"I purchased the two DVDs from the Zappa site and paid more than Amazon's price for this whole set. I like the DVDs a lot but would like an easy way to play the music in my car or on my iPod.

So this is a really good deal.

Dweezil's arrangements are very similar to Frank's but, somehow, seem more easily absorbed. Cleaner. I don't know how to explain it in musical terms but I remember, when I saw them in Albuquerque in August, 2007, that the structure of Zombie Woof was crystal clear and beautifully complex at the same time. Then that happened with most of the other songs they played.

If this seems like too much of an investment, Amazon also has good prices on the DVDs alone and a single CD selection

A friend suggested I should try this DVD Concert.
It's the best $20 you can possibly spend.
The filming and especially the surround sound quality is unbelievable. If you have a good quality sound system you will not be disappointed. So many say they are recorded in 5.1 or DTS but they not much better than 2 channel.
The quitar solo by Dweezil on Inca Roads me cry, but then I suffer from depression. This track on it's own is worth the price of admission.
There are an incredible number of songs on the 2 DVD's.
This is a superior concert in all regards and the 10 musicians and singers are as good as it gets.

3136698,5,B001502LNI,"I was always of two minds about Frank Zappa. I thought his music was brilliant, but I found his humor juvenile in the extreme and his stage persona really irritating and geeky. This DVD captures both aspects of his work, but fortunately, the brilliance of the music comes through much more than the junior-high-boys-bathroom sensibilities. The band here is beyond impressive. They navigate the incredible complexities of this stuff as though they were playing Louie Louie. Everybody is outstanding. Even though Dweezil's stage demeanor is very low key (he looks vaguely bored most of the time), his playing is actually fairly expressive--more so than his dad's was. The sound is terrific, and above all, Dweezil's editing is fantastic. So many music DVDs seem to be edited by people who never heard the music before, with odd cuts that bear no relation to what's being played, soloists off camera, and video tricks for their own sake. None of that here. There is creativity in the editing, but always in service to the music. And in many places the editing actually enhances the music, highlighting some little accent that would otherwise have gone unnoticed or intensifying a solo. With most music videos I watch a few songs, then get bored and turn it off to come back some other time. This one kept me riveted from beginning to end. If you have even a passing curiosity about Zappa's music, this would be a great place to start. And if you're a fan, I can't imagine a better present than this.",1216512000,2,1496,4.8023255813953485
3136699,5,B001502LNI,"My band-mates and I have been going through a spell of Zappa fascination for months, so when I heard about this tour I was eager to catch a glimpse. I remember Dweezil as an MTV VJ more than a guitarist, I'm ashamed to say, but I still had pretty high expectations from the buzz. Those expectations were roundly exceeded. I nursed this collection over the course of a week and watched the final, mind-blowing segments over the Independence Day. That choice was so fitting, my joy was so complete, that I've felt the need to pass it on.

Just looking at an uninhibited Napoleon Murphy Brock while he sings and prances giddily around makes me feel free. Pete Griffin is having a total ball on bass, I'd swear Aaron Arntz hits every key on five keyboards over the course of each tune, and Billy Hulting switches from bells to bongos as if every band has a guy doing likewise. I do believe I'm head over heels in love with Scheila Gonzalez, and I am now at liberty to recognize Terry Bozzio as the greatest drummer alive in place of my previous percussion hero, the soured Brit Mitch Mitchell. Not that the excellent Joe Travers suffers from inferiority playing alongside any more than the Italian virtuoso Steve Vai is playing second guit-fiddle as he ecstatically wrestles with his tremolo bar. And yes, I'd pawn a guitar for a chance to jam with Jamie Kime. While all this great talent is worth experiencing on its own, if you really want to know where freedom can take you let me recommend this band assembled by the son of a great, truly American composer who felt personal and artistic liberty to such a degree that not only could he compose all the frenetic music I witness, but he could give his torch-bearing progeny a name like Dweezil and his song a title like ""Zomby Woof"" (a personal favorite cut).

An eternal thank you to FZ, Dweezil Zappa, and this entire collection of musicians, sound techs, and video production artists for making my lifetime. If you love music, if you have an open mind, and if you have ever believed in the potential of American freedom I recommend at least five minutes of this DVD to cure whatever may ail you. And to the square peg among round reviews who says Terry Bozzio doesn't fit, since when has Zappa music about meeting the pat expectations of the banal passing for criticism? I'm sure Mr. Bozzio will be happy to show you exactly where it fits, and my opinion is that the drum-off climax of disc two is the greatest performance of anything I've seen anywhere... and I just caught the Return to Forever reunion last month!",1215388800,2,2567,4.566160520607375
3136700,5,B001502LNI,"I saw the show in Dallas, mainly because I wanted to see Terry Bozzio. He was crazy good, but so was everybody else, especially Dweezil. He plays with such emotion. Standing toe to toe with Steve Vai and coming out on top doesn't happen every day. And it's great on this DVD, too. All the players involved earned my highest respect. I think Frank would approve.",1215388800,,361,4.484848484848484

He was a genius composer, and this DVD proves it.  All of the performances are fantastic and the guest performances by Steve Vai and Terry Bozzio are just the icing on the cake.

A masterpiece!",1214352000,,353,4.287878787878788
3136722,5,B001502LNI,"No one on this planet is composing  music like this anymore. It's intricate, heartfelt, melodic, humorous, and takes talented musicians to play it. Too many people have closed their minds to Zappa's music just because of his lyrics, and that's too bad, because the music speaks for itself, and for me, lyrics are secondary.

Dweezil assembled a smoking hot band, hit the road, and now we have a document of some of these shows. This DVD has performances from two, maybe three, shows. The set list is phenomenal, although not one song from ""Joe's Garage"" or ""You Are What You Is"" (two of my favorite Zappa albums) is included. The audio mixes, stereo and DD 5.1, sound great. The video is clear and the editing is good, but there are plenty of spilt-screen shots, and the camera angle from the guitar headstock looking down on the strings, when used, doesn't show much. The video is presented in a widescreen format. Disc one is 1 hour 54 minutes long; disc two is 1 hour 34 minutes and has a ten-minute interview with Dweezil and ""Cheepnis"" as bonus features.

The only thing missing from this performance, that was routine at Frank's show, is the audience participation and general weirdness that was played out on-stage. And that's ok by me. I've had the pleasure to see Frank about a dozen times in concert and some of these theatrics were too much and I wished they had focused more on the music. You can only throw around an inflatable doll so many times before it gets boring. One gig I remember Frank did nothing but sit down in a chair facing the audience, smoke cigarettes, and conduct the band. I felt a bit ripped off that he didn't play his guitar or sing. But all I feel when watching this DVD is amazement and pleasure. This is such a killer DVD, the music is timeless, and hopefully Dweezil has sparked some interest for this music to a younger generation. Highest recommendation!",1214006400,24,1895,4.617210682492582

What a wonderful, masterful thing Dweezil has put together and released to the world!
  The band is incredible, a real Frank quality ensemble. Their precision playing, coupled with the unbridled fun they are having jumped out of my monitor at me. Throw in Terry Bozzio and Steve Via and Oh MY what a show. And, unlike previous reviews, I thought Steve Via brought alot to the party.
  This DVD will make it easier for me to pass on Frank's music to my kids as my 14 year old said as she stopped in, ""Those guys can play, who is that?"" As I told her, it's the son of Frank Zappa, the guy whose song titles you say are wierd, playing his Daddys music, she actually, finally agreed that maybe she needed to give it a listen. From that statement alone, Dweezil's grand plan of spreading Frank's music to a new generation is on the mark.
  Frank Fans and Parents.....buy this astonishing work and play it where others cant help but hear it. Then let the music of this great composer work its magic.",1211068800,7,1325,4.196850393700787
3136731,5,B001502LNI,"WARNING: at the time of this review, the product description here on Amazon is just plain wrong. It states that the band ""duet"" with Frank via video on the tune ""Chunga's Revenge."" Neither that song nor any other duet with Frank is on the dvd, cd, or dvd/cd version of this release.

That aside, this is an delightful release. Dweezil has selected some of his dad's most accessible tunes, assembled an utterly amazing band to perform them, toured the world for months, and captured for our video amusement and amazement the performances of two consecutive nights.

The songs are among the most popular from Frank's catalog, emphasizing the albums Over-Nite Sensation, Apostrophe', and Roxy & Elsewhere. That was a period in Frank's career when all of his skills hit their zenith together for the first time - his uniquely classical sensibility of long sections of composed instrumental complexity, interspersed with a jazzer's delight of great chord progressions underlying portions of free improvising, overlaid with pure rock band distorted tones, and pop vocal melodies, but minus most of the scatalogical explorations that alienated some listeners (and prevented radio play) a little later in Frank's career.

Dweezil's band is comprosed of mostly unknown musicians, of such a caliber that each of them could easily have been in any of Frank's bands. The one exception, and a brilliant decision on Dweezil's part, was to include Napoleon Murphy Brock on lead vocals, from Frank's band of the mid-70's, and indeed those three key albums listed above. Several reviewers have noted Napoleon's obvious delight at the performances of these tunes by this band, and his delight becomes ours as we discover what he already knows - these kids nail some of the most complex music ever written, at least in the rock realm, and make it look easy, and fun.

A couple of other Frank alumni, Steve Vai and Terry Bozzio, are on this dvd as well, but appearing in cameos in the middle and again at the end. Frankly (pun intended), these are the weaker parts of the show. These guys are phenomenal players, but part of what is so delightful about this concert is the ego-free devotion of the core band to this wonderful music, and the purity of that is somewhat disrupted by inserting ""special guest stars.""

The video production is as astonishing as the music. The average in-concert dvd is taken from a recording of the video that is on the side screens at the show, or a tv broadcast of a show along the tour. It's usually pretty well-done, but with several cringe-inducing moments where we're stuck looking at the wrong guy, such as the guitar player taking it easy while the sax player solos his brains out, just not where WE can see it. Or, just lots of shots of band members playing the song, mindlessly quick-cut mtv-style for no apparent reason...

None of that here - this video is comprised of many shots, true, and they cut from camera to camera rapidly, but it's different: every single shot is on-screen for a reason. We see the bass player when he is doing something intricate, we see the sax player when she reacts to something the drummer did, we see Dweezil as he points to who gets the next solo, we see guitar and keyboards side-by-side while they play a complex melody in unison. There's a lot of shots because this is intricate music played by 8+ musicians, so there's a lot going on, at almost all times. But not only are no details missed, but while this writer has repeatedly enjoyed many of these tunes for 30+ years since their original release, the video has actually revealed, through the intelligence of the editing, little compositional details that I had never noticed before. Amazing...

Great tunes, a fabulous band, superior video production - what's not to like? This release is recommended for those who have been lucky enough to see one of these shows, as well as those that haven't. If you are a fan of Frank's music, it is essential. If you're not, this would be a great way to get to know some great music that you've been missing.",1210723200,41,4058,4.772079772079772
3371076,4,B001502LNI,"After weathering a plethora of FZ tributes, some of which are rather good but sometimes sloppy and self-indulgent, many of us fans were resigned to the fact that the man who left on his final tour in the early 90s was the only presence who could truly deliver this very particular musical content. Whether it was a Euro jazz group, a virtuoso chamber ensemble, or reunion of veteran band members, respectful and well-intentioned as it was, it all just seemed to come across as lip service. Something was missing.

After viewing this filmed performance of ZPZ, one may realize that what was missing was blood. Though Dweezil doesn't bleed in quite the same way as father Frank, it is apparent that here is the man who immersed himself in the music (not many others could have the same opportunity) to the degree where he could take it on the road and deliver what really feels like a Zappa concert. Not exactly 100%, but closer than anyone in this generation will experience elsewhere.

And that is the point. Dweezil's mission has been to reintroduce the inimitable music of Frank Zappa to a younger demographic starved for alternatives to the mind-numbingly insipid consumer sock stuffers that pass for popular music in this day and age. With little to compare it to, Zappa's music can't be anything but fresh, a challenging listen but always entertaining. To do this Dweezil has assembled an enthusiastic ensemble that comes close to looking like a group Frank would have hand picked. Scheila Gonzales in particular (a music teacher at a high school in Simi Valley of all places), who accompanies herself on keyboard while improvising on sax, is someone to watch for, both in this show and her future career. Percussionist Billy Hulting nicely fills the void left in the absence of Ruth Underwood. All players of this really difficult material not only pull it off, but make it look really fun. Dweezil himself is both participant and observer onstage: at no point does he attempt to BE Frank, his playing style is his own when he improvs (more fluid and high register), and he has wisely avoided presenting songs like Dinah Moe Hum, TTs & Beer, Bobby Brown Goes Down, etc., because it's just not who Dweezil is and he didn't want the material to seem ""like a cheap imitation"".

Of course veteran performer Napoleon Murphy Brock is more than up to the task of putting that ""snarky"" personality into his vocal performance, and as such takes on a gargantuan task of singing most of the songs and making them sound like the real deal, along with the meticulously researched arrangements, obviously taken note-for-note from the original recordings. Another very welcome guest presence is Terry Bozzio, whom many consider the greatest drummer who ever worked with Frank. The camera dawdles lovingly over his considerable percussive kit, which resembles a cross between a space shuttle console and a sea anemone. And the songs ""I'm So Cute"", ""Trying to Grow a Chin"" and the epic ""Punky's Whips"" (best recorded performance of this IMHO) are only included as only Bozzio can deliver. ""You know, TECHNICALLY,"" he assures the audience, ""I'm still alive."" That's an understatement.

And as if that weren't enough, Dweezil brings in Steve Vai, the man who actually taught him to play guitar (dad was too busy I guess, and didn't want to ""work"" while with family). As you can imagine, much of this generous show's second half is devoted to some scorching guitar battles, particularly on ""Montana"", ""Zomby Woof"" and ""Trouble Every Day"". Earlier on, we are treated to a stunning improv section in ""Pound for a Brown"", where Dweezil sheds his guitar and conducts the band with a series of secret hand signals. This is one of the more magical moments when you KNOW you're witnessing a genuine Zappa concert.

Don't approach this video expecting a sort of nostalgic experience.... unless you define ""nostalgia"" as a time in the past, where artists had the unmitigated audacity to intrude upon rock audiences with truly exciting, challenging, thought-provoking and perversely fun music. It's still there, and will continue to be so, as Dweezil Zappa has stated his intention to continue the legacy of his extraordinary father's music.... minus the Winstons, of course. DZ may not have the same edge as FZ did, though this could work in favor of the music, which may have not enjoyed sufficient reach in the past due to how many felt about Frank's personality. Whatever. To paraphrase the composer (who refuses to die): Zappa isn't dead, he just smells younger.

Let go of any preconceptions, and enjoy a smashing delivery of Zappa music as it sounds today.",1210464000,83,4639,4.903184713375796
3371077,5,B001502LNI,"When I first heard about the ZPZ project I admit I was a bit more that skeptical.

This DVD/CD combo more than dispels any apprehension.
The band is beyond top-notch. Each and every one of these musicians demonstrates a mind-boggling level of skill and most importantly, passion for these performances. And it's great to see Napoleon Murphy Brock having such a great time AND holding his own with a band all (?) young enough to be his children. I hate that he's not still touring with them.

The song selections are great and the execution is perfect. On the DVD, the camera work is really good there are a lot of quick cuts, but let's face it, with Frank's music to follow the action a lot of cuts are really needed.

Are there any other quibbles? Sure. (I still get annoyed with Steve Vai's 'stunt guitar') In the long run, the quality and the overall care put into this package really stands out.",1210118400,12,899,4.5030674846625764

Blinding fast and accurate mallot and vibes play: check.
Incredible sax solo from multi-talented Scheila Gonzalez: check.
Dweezil doing his father proud in the guitar solo dept.: check.
With Napoleon Murphy Brock singing much of the lead vocals along with his on-stage spirited personality there comes an air of authenticity that Zappa fans want. Terry Bozzio's contribution was a real treat.
The only thing I missed was Frank's patented unique voice on songs like Cosmic Debris, I'm The Slime and Trouble Comin Every Day et al.
Dweezil gives a heartfelt thank you to all the fans at the show(filmed in Portland and Seattle) for supporting his father's music.

When I discovered Frank Zappa's music, he was no longer touring so I never had a chance to see him perform.  I saw the ZPZ tour in '06 and '07, and have my ticket for this summer's tour.  Led by Dweezil Zappa, an incredible guitarist, this group is made up of absolutely top-notch musicians.  Each time I saw them I was blown away by their musicianship, and continue to be blown away each time I watch the DVD.  Their reproduction of FZ's music is nearly flawless.

There is also a 2 disc DVD only set.

The third product listed on Amazon contains an single audio cd compilation

I went to see these guys last year, and don't let the fact that Frank is not playing with them put you off.  It was AMAZING! It was like going to see a Zappa's greatest hits show.
I have seen Frank twice live, and although I am a HUGE fan of his work,  in my humble opinion there is a lot of detrius that you have to sit through, to get to the good bits.  This show and disc set contained everything that I ever wanted to hear live.
The band are awesome and Dweezils guitar work is jaw droppingly good.

3371084,5,B001502LNI,"Dweezil Zappa had each and every core member of the Zappa Plays Zappa ensemble study the actual arrangements that have been chosen for these performances. Sometimes it's a well documented Frank Zappa studio version, sometimes a well documented FZ tour version taken from 30 years of touring and sometimes it's an obscure version few have heard but exists in FZs massive vault that is managed by his family.

Dweezil Zappa, his Zappa Plays Zappa Core Band and Special Guests(Steve Vai, Terry Bozzio & Napoleon Murphy Brock) get the tone colors of each particular composition giving as much respect to the composers intent as possible. In preparation for performance the Zappa Plays Zappa band have isolated specific tracks of multi-track studio master recordings to get the necessary tone colors down in the specific arrangement of a given composition. This approach to rehearsal and performance is the same way a modern conductor such as Pierre Boulez would work with an Orchestra. This represents Frank Zappa the American Composer more so than some cover band charade that is often associated with representing many artists whose work primarily had or continues to get marketed in the rock and roll medium.

Be it if you are a long time listener of Frank Zappa or new to his multifarious body of work it is fair to say that this Zappa Plays Zappa DVD Project is as close as any group of musicians,including any given Frank Zappa touring band have ever achieved with regards to the A) The Composers Intent and B)The wide diversity represented here in the composers canon of works.",1204675200,15,1580,4.958490566037736

So, you get the feeling that the spirit of the music of Frank is carried on by this band with two well professionally shot concerts, nice picture and a big 5.1 surround sound. I enjoyed the performance of the guest artists, Terry Bozzio, Steve Vai and especially Napoleon Murphy Brock. Frank Zappa, has succeed to made accessible music with his little orchestra playing rock with elements of classical, jazz and pop with a originality and sens of humor that is difficult to surpass.

3371117,5,B001502LNI,"Frank Zappa defined music as ""any sound you can control"". This lives up to that definition. Progressive jazz, classical, rock even numbers resembling show tunes: this DVD is a brilliant display of musicianship. There are no weak spots. It is very well shot and the sound mix is excellent. It is great to hear such fantastic music and see the musicians having so much fun playing it. Sheila Gonzales is amazing on saxophone, keyboards and everything else she does. Steve Vai makes the guitar do things I've never heard a guitar do and that includes Hendrix. Napoleon Murphy Brock must have a painting aging in a closet somewhere because he looks and sounds as good as he did when he played with Frank over 25 years ago. Dweezil is both a great leader and an astonishing  guitar player.  Every musician on that stage is very accomplished or they wouldn't be there. I have never used so many superlatives but I had never seen this DVD before. I have played it for friends who had no interest in Zappa's music and they were blown away. Buy it. Watch it. Crank up the sound. If you ever have a chance to see them play in person, treat yourself. They are even better in person.",1325289600,,1171,4.518867924528302

3371131,5,B001502LNI,"Just over a dozen years ago, I saw Band From Utopia live in Chicago.  They were a Frank Zappa tribute band, composed of ex-sidemen from various incarnations of Frank Zappa's touring bands.  They were quite good, but I have to say, the performances captured on Zappa Plays Zappa absolutely blow them out of the water!  Dweezil has assembled an amazingly talented band, and when you add Napoleon Murphy Brock, Steve Vai, and Terry Bozzio to the mix, the combination is musical DYNAMITE!

Brock is in fine form.  Here's a guy who toured with Zappa back in the 70s with one of the more talented lineups of Frank's band.  He's back with a vengeance, clearly enjoying every minute of it.  ""The Torture Never Stops"" on Disc 2 was a standout song for me, as Brock does lead vocals and tortured screams.  Dweezil's guitar solo in ""Torture"" is brilliant as well, and the number is absolutely captivating.

Just about every track on this DVD is a winner, but a few more standouts include: ""Trouble Every Day"" (an extravaganza of guitar solos, sax solos, drum solos, and band magic);""Punkys Whips"" (a Terry Bozzio fiesta);""Zomby Woof"" (featuring an over-the-top Vai solo);""Pound for a Brown"" (one of Zappa's most incredible instrumental pieces; and ""Montana"" (a song I've always considered one of the best combinations of Zappa's comedy and musical complexity).

The FanPak is a stupendous accomplishment, containing both DVDs of the concert, plus the 3-CD set audio set.  For Zappa fans, this collection is well worth the money, and will not disappoint.",1292198400,2,1542,4.961089494163424
3371132,4,B001502LNI,"Overall a very good career-spanning introduction to the man's music as well as an entertaining tribute. I love the way Dweezil includes Frank veterans like Napoleon Murphy Brock and Terry Bozzio with great young talent like Sheila Garcia.  There is a real sense of fun without letting the theatrics take over.  Despite a load of talent on this stage, there is no question that Dweezil is in charge and his solos are excellent.  As far as live concerts go, I put this right up there with the Talking Heads' ""Stop Making Sense"" and that is no mean feat.",1286755200,2,551,4.6020408163265305

I've been listening to FZ since I was 8 and was fortunate enough to see the great man a couple of times.

3371135,5,B001502LNI,"You have to respect Dweezil's heartfelt motivation to mount a tour profiling the music of his father. Dweezil states he took two years off just to learn the pieces and I believe it. To state that Frank Zappa's material is difficult to perform is an understatement. Frank's bands all required the most talented of musicians, each of whom had enormous respect for his farsighted compositional talent and brilliant musicianship.

What we have here is Dweezil's approach to a Zappa-inspired evening of music. The music is outstanding and so are the performances. Many of the pieces are metered a little slower than Zappa performed them during his day, but keep in mind the complexity of the music. During Zappa's tours his musicians lived and breathed the music and Zappa would often push the envelope to stretch their abilities. As Zappa's tours progressed and his musicians became more proficient with the material, the tempos would accelerate. Dweezil chose to approach some of these pieces at a slower tempo and it's only speculation as to whether this was a stylistic decision or a decision based out of necessity to ensure a clean performance.

One thing I really respect while watching these performances is how Dweezil lets the music speak for itself. He doesn't get into physical or facial grinding while performing. He stands and plays, just as his father did. Most of the time, even when he's shredding, his face and stance are relaxed. He practices economy of motion while playing; he moves what's necessary only when necessary. I respect this.

The two guest performers during the latter part of the performance are former Zappa alumni, guitarist Steve Vai and drummer Terry Bozzio, both of whom are prodigious masters at their instrument. Both musicians provide fabulous performances and are allowed time to show off their talents, but this DVD is really about the music. The DVD doesn't focus too much on Steve's playing, although he takes a number of outstanding solos. Terry is provided a lengthy drum solo towards the end of the performance and the encore culminates in a trading of licks between Dweezil and Steve and eventually other band members.

What makes this DVD really stand out is it's not a DVD only Zappa fans can appreciate. My wife came over from China two years ago and has never heard of Frank Zappa or seen any of the musicians on the DVD. She sat with me for two hours carefully watching every song, asking questions about the musicians and the music, and this provided a great opportunity for me to teach her about this brilliant genius named Frank Zappa who gave such a wide-ranging gift to the world through his music. At the end of the DVD she said to me, ""Whaaa! I like this man... His music very good!""

I think this is what Dweezil hoped to achieve--to preserve Frank's music and memory for future generations to discover and enjoy. Dweezil expresses this sentiment to the crowd through tears of respect and joy. You can see the love and respect he has for his father.

It really goes to show, while Frank may no longer be with us, his music really does live on. Dweezil's homage on this DVD is a testiment that that.",1277337600,,3156,4.792279411764706

3371137,5,B001502LNI,"I'm very impressed with Frank's boy. He takes this very seriously and presents Franks music with all the respect it deserves. Nice touch to have Vai, Bozzio, and Brock on board to lend authenticity to some of the key songs that featured them back in the day. In the interview that Dweezil does in the Bonus section, he says that there are some songs that he won't do because the vocal stamp that Frank put on them make them impossible to recreate. I think that's a smart move because there was a song or two in this concert where Frank had minor vocal parts in the original that seemed a bit off here. They could have used digital processing to deepen the tone to more closely resemble Franks voice but they didn't. There was a point where Brock uses two mics, one with a squeeky high tone and reverb, so they certainly could have gone the other way too. I still give this 5 stars because everything else is Top Notch.
There's three songs that Frank didn't want anyone to play except Dweezil - Watermelon In Easter Hay, Zoot Allures and Black Napkins. Dweezil did do Black Napkins in this show and said that there was a song that he couldn't do because it was too emotional. I'm guessing it's Watermelon In Easter Hay. I love that song and it always brings a tear to my eye when hearing Frank do it. I hope that someday Dweezil will perform this.",1276387200,,1346,4.388

Inca Roads completely blew me away and Dweezil is great at playing both like his father and with his own shredding technique. I've seen ZPZ twice in Phx and both shows were fantastic. The members of the band are great musically- I wish they would freak out just a bit more ( just an opinion ). The fan pack is the Bomb because you get the cd's as well as just the concert dvds- good for the ol ipod!

Seeing how his son (I had no clue how good he is himself) and other musicians perform Frank's characteristic, sometimes totally incoherent, a-rhythmic and full of sudden twists and unexpected sounds is a different experience. What a great effort and amazing musicianship. Just watch Steve Vai guitar ""conversations"" with Dweezil, or phenomenal Scheila Gonzalez playing on sax, keys and singing at the same time!!

3371141,5,B001502LNI,"You have several options with this first 2006 Zappa Plays Zappa Tour (actually recorded over two nights - Portland and Seattle - at the end of the tour), just the CD (1 select disc), just the DVD (2 disc) or the 5 disc Fan Pak combination presented here (2 DVDs and 3 CDs).

Firstly and mostly it's important to know this was a great concert (I was at the Seattle show). The core band (Zappa and Travers, Griffin, Kime, Arntz, Gonzales and Hulting) are mostly young (Dweezil appears to be the oldest at 37) and competent musicians. They also appear to be having a great time playing the stuff. The special guests from various FZ bands (Vai, Bozzio and Brock) add a sense of depth and weight to the group and do a great job of bringing some of the old Zappa flavor to the performances. Nepoleon for me was a special treat to see/hear. He is alive and all over the place with his singing, acting, dancing and playing. On the DVD Bozzio is pretty fun to watch in his drumship, and Vai delightfully dramatic and fluid with his illuminated frets.

The two venues are quite different. Portland's Aladdin Theatre is fairly intimate - and the crowd relaxed (it was 12/21, Frank's 65th B-day) The Paramount in Seattle was bigger and stiffer (although the crowd appreciatively on their feet for multiple ovations). But i remember the show going on for close to 4 hours - that may be an exageration but it was an abundant offering none-the-less, and the filming production was extensive (12 cameras!), and the encores endless. I also remember thinking about half way through the show (probably during the amazing ""Pound for a Brown"", once the band was really warmed up and relaxed) how damn good they were. It was almost as good as watching FZ...(and maybe even more consistent). Production value and quality (recording, filming, editing and packaging) is of course excellent.

The three discs of music are pretty much the same songs as on the DVD - a mixture of the two shows, leaning heavily on the Seattle show.

I think all these things almost three years after those recording because I just saw them play in Spokane, and my appreciation is perhaps stronger than ever. The venue was smaller, the core band similar (minus Arntz on extra keyboards and horn, but with the addition of singer Ben Thomas), and the show just over 2 hours long (less extended versions)... but at about half way through the show I again noticed they were finally energized, relaxed and warmed up and playing really well. When Dweezil lit out into one of the many extended solos I had the feeling I was listening to Zappa play. And I was. I left in a warm glow (after all, there was a nice new variety of songs being performed, and I got to share it with my 14 yr old daughter who can't get enough of FZ's music), marveling what it must be like for Dweezil to be learning about his father from the inside out. He seems pretty blown away by it still.

I'm really glad the Zappa tribute band is still on the road. I'll gladly see them again. They are the ultimate ""tribute band"", like a string quartet that makes a career out of covering Mozart, serious musicians dedicated to their project. And it's nice to see them playing more in their own way (no special old guests, some of the songs even sounding a bit unlike FZ, and more like Dweezil's shredder Van Halen style, and no attempt by Dweezil to imitate his father's conducting style), and digging deeper into the vast repertoire. Definitely check them out when they come your way, but also get this recording to see them in full glory.",1259884800,2,3556,4.55868544600939
3371142,5,B001502LNI,"This dvd/cd package is amazing!  One of the images one the package is a bit misleading however -- they do not show the footage of Dweezil jamming with his dad in the background of the stage...that being said, it doesn't take away from the sheer greatness of Dweezil's guitar shredding.  Steve Vai makes a couple appearances along with Terry Bozio...just absolutely amazing.

Dweezil lives up to his father's legacy and presents Frank's music without flaw.

Really neat camera angles too! -- > There is a camera mounted on the neck of Dweezil's guitar!",1254009600,,551,4.89247311827957

However it took 3 weeks to get the DVD.  That is unacceptable plus the jewel case was cracked.  Thought about sending it back but I didn't want to wait another 3-4 weeks to get another.  Do not have anything shipped via Media Mail.  A reputable company would not use such methods to ship their products.  I could have walked the DVD from their company to my home faster.  Probably won't purchase any thing from them again - digiateyes_dvdplanet.,1248825600,,609,4.513761467889908
3371145,5,B001502LNI,Dweezil definitely honors his dad's music with the Zappa Plays Zappa group. He's put together an incredible configuration of musicians which is definitely needed to pursue any of Frank Zappa's musical pieces. I got the chance to see Frank in concert during the late 60s early 70s and if you close your eyes and listen hard there's barely any difference.,1244505600,,353,4.9
3371146,5,B001502LNI,"This is not a cover band for Frank's work - not even close. It's quickly apparent that Dweezil is his father's son - and then some. Frank was a cruel taskmaster when it came to musicians, but it was from the crucible of Frank's work that the careers of Steve Vai, Terry Bozio and many others were launched.

Dweezil's recreation is in every respect a masterful construct and interpretation of his father's music. And all this without cheapening or diminishing what Frank accomplished in any way. In fact, quite the opposite! This work is so engaging that you (like me) may find your jaw firmly stuck to your coffee table as you spend hours mesmerized by the astounding accomplishment of what Dweezil has done. If Frank could see this, he might just soil himself.

First of all, Dweezil is an accomplished guitarist in his own right, holding up just fine to bouts of dueling guitars with Steve Vai during Steve's special guest appearances. But make no mistake, the footage of Steve is alone worth the price of this DVD.

Scheila Gonzalez deserves special recognition as her work on Sax could very well just rip your face right off! She is AMAZING!

Is this work Frank? Well yes and no. You might better say that it is Frank's work squared! In other words, Dweezil takes it well beyond the next level.

There is just so much astounding material here that you've just got to see it for yourself. Buy this DVD, you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",1243123200,,1436,4.6156862745098035

Dweezil has brought together a group of amazing musicians and devoted all their efforts into bringing Frank's music to a whole new audience. The response has been amazing. Dweezil doesn't try to be Frank, but rather he channels Frank's amazing guitar prowess with unbelievable results. Every band member brings their A game to the party. You have to add this to your collection.",1242777600,,445,4.792207792207792

3371172,4,B001502LNI,"I've been a Frank Zappa fan since high school, when a friend gave me a mix tape. We often lament that this modern composer died before we could see him in concert. So when Zappa Plays Zappa came around, we zipped up to Portland in the middle of a December rainstorm with slim wallets and wobbly crutches.

That's the only way to go in Oregon. Especially for a 65th birthday concert being recorded for a commercial release! Now it's your turn to enjoy Frank with the ZPZ fan pack.

The rock maestro left the building in 1993, but his son Dweezil carries on the legacy. Joined by Joe Travers, the vault-meister responsible for Frank's master-tapes, ZPZ includes a rotating guest list of Zappa alumni. For taped shows in Portland and Seattle, this meant vocalist vet Napoleon Murphy Brock, drum-master Terry Bozzio, and guitar god Steve Vai.

You can experience them in several different versions:

>2 DVD set--the core package
>1 or 2 disc CD
>The most expensive 2 DVD/3CD fan pak.

The shows focuses on cuts from the mid-to late 1970's with a few Sixties classics thrown in. More pop and less socio-political, it's a crowd and company-pleasing performance.

For the most part, ZPZ sounds to me like it is interpreting Frank's music directly from the discography, with little in the way of new flourishes or rearrangements. Right down to the Don Pardo impersonation by Billy Hulting on ""I'm the Slime"". However, they make a fair amount of solo improvs and lyrical ad-libs. Also, it's their own live performance--no samples slipped in that I can tell (aside from effects like the wind in ""Don't Eat the Yellow Snow""). That matches my memory of the show.

Unfortunately, the same disability which gave us head-of-the-line entry also put my friend at the back of the audience (the bouncers said his crutches were a crowd hazard). Aside from cheating us out of front row seating and video immortality, I had trouble seeing certain performances.

Fortunately, the DVD footage offers a good view. Some sound and visual edits are a little awkward or nonsensical, but the overall presentation alternates between strategic and tactical shots of the band. The former lets you see how they play together, holding or jumping between members within a given section of music. The latter pays attention to hands, sticks, and lips during notable passages. Dweezil also uses a Fret Cam to showcase his licks. Occasional split screens also let the viewer compare different members during the passage, with the camera centered on the performance.

But don't mistake this for an instructional video. Ya got plenty of spins, jumps, pans `n' zooms to stimulate your eyes. As others have pointed out, there's never a moment when the picture is facing the wrong way or too tricked out with effects to see what is going on. Sometimes you get a mike stand blocking someone's face, or a camera craning around the frame, but nothing that spoils a moment.

That said, most of the footage comes from the Seattle show.

The Roseland is what the liner notes charitably call ""a very rock `n' roll looking venue""--with a low ceiling, lots of obstructive pylons and the standing crowd pushed close to the stage. Some of the more rockin' portions of the set come from this footage.

Seattle's Paramount, by comparison, looks open and bright. The crowd is neatly seated, the band elegantly framed onstage, and you can see right in the footage that camera operators had more room to operate. Especially for long shots, it makes sense. Plus, Frank Zappa had history here.

Most performances are taken wholly from one venue or the other. But ""Trouble Every Day"" cuts back and forth, and includes a guitar duel, saxophone duel, and drum duel in a 24-minute epic of sound.

The audio is coherent. No funky echoes, mike squeals, or muffling. You can hear the crowd when Dweezil wants you to hear it, and you can hear the music.

The CDs sound like slightly trimmed and remixed audio of the DVDs... adding ""Cheepnis"" and cranking up the drums a bit, but otherwise offering little variation. That's fine with me, because I'm tired of going to great shows that don't end up on disc at all. I'm gratified this program includes the Portland performances of ""Punky's Whips"" and ""Peaches En Regalia""--two of the few songs in the set from that long-ago mix tape. A good set list overall.

Overall, this is a good set for Zappa veterans and noobs alike. I was introduced directly to Frank's social works, like ""Bobby Brown Goes Down"" and ""Honey, Don't You Want a Man Like Me?"" in my status-avoiding days at the high school. But these cuts would probably scare off current generations, who sometime seem more like Bobby and Betty than ever before. The real gift of ZPZ is that it offers Frank's art through his more accessible and yet signature works.

Some fun stuff is still missing from the set. Such as Dweezil conducting the audience, the word of the night, or the Roseland singing ""Happy Birthday"" for Frank. Dweezil's video duet with Frank doesn't make it either.

""Cheepnis"", one of the Portland encores, is relegated to the Bonus features. That and a short interview with Dweezil are it for extras. Setup is limited to PCM Stereo and 5.1 English--no subtitles for the French or hearing impaired.

The box itself is a digipak in a cheap cardstock sleeve. But it looks sturdy enough, with the same width as two DVD cases, so it should do fine on your shelf. However, it uses those overlapping trays that force you to peel off a disc to reach one underneath.

That's okay. ZPZ offers a historic and well-documented show from the safety of your living room. No parking hassles on Burnside, no muggers or drug dealers lurking around the side streets, and no 70-mile drive on the I-5. Just you, your couch, and Zappa all the way, baby.",1237334400,8,5783,4.781344032096289
3371173,5,B001502LNI,"I've always liked Zappa but have found it difficult at times to get past his humor. This DVD showcases his music, which, for me, because of the production and the song selections, isn't diminished in any way by Zappa's lyrics, enhanced by excellent mixing and production. I really got into it. The music is all there and is delivered by exemplary musicianship. The video is well done as well, without any silly attempts at ""artfulness"". The sound quality is excellent, as Frank would want it. His son does his dad proud.",1236384000,,520,4.725274725274725
3371174,5,B001502LNI,"Everything is fantastic about this DVD set.  The performance, the song selection, the video, the filming, the editing and the audio.  It is one of the best jam bands I have heard.

I WAS AFRAID TO BUY THIS.  I thought it was going to be just another crappy tribute band type concert.  And I though it was going to be another one of these cheaply filmed and edited DVD's (like the ones by Dave Matthews or Roxie Music, with constant cuts and zooming in and out).

I WAS AMAZED AT HOW GOOD THIS WAS.  It is Dweezil Zappa playing his father's songs, but he makes them his own.  The band is really into it.  There is just some fantastic jamming throughout.  There are some amazing guitar solos by Zappa and Steve Vai.

This product comes in many different flavors.  There is a one disc CD.  There is a 2 disc CD.  There is this 2 disc DVD.  There is also a 3 CD and 3 DVD combination (maybe the best one to get because you can listen to the whole thing in your car, without having to first use your computer to rip the audio).  It is my only complaint about this.  I almost bought the single CD because I didn't know that there were more options available.

This is a three and a half hour concert that professionally filmed.  A great job was done in the filming and the editing.  The camera is focused on the right person at the right time.

The band is the Zappa Plays Zappa band.  They are currently touring (2009).  Once I saw this DVD, I really wanted to see the show, but it sold out quickly here in Santa Cruz.

For this concert, there are 3 guest stars.  Napoleon Murphy Broch plays during the whole concert.  He is like the second star, doing most of the singing and playing sax and flute.  (makes me wonder what the singing is like when he is not a guest).  Terry Bozzio plays on a number tracks half way through the show.  He sings on many of the songs he used to sing when he has with Frank Zappa.  And Steve Vai is there for about the last third of the concert.

The extras on the DVD are one song (Cheepnis) from another show and an interview with the Dweeze.",1234051200,,2069,4.188295165394402
3371175,5,B001502LNI,"I was fortunate enough to see the show in Portland, where I live, which was recorded on Frank Zappa's birthday.  There are only a few excerpts from that show on the DVD with the rest in Seattle which is by far a better and bigger concert hall, thus, probably the reason why they used most of that footage.  Regardless of this fact, this fan pack is a must have for any musician, true music lover, as well as a fan of Frank Zappa.  Dweezil has changed his style completely to emulate his father's playing and he has become quite the guitar vurtuoso.  The band is incredible and I consider them one of the best musical groups put together in a long time.  Yes this show is a long one but one doesn't notice if they are into it because there are so many great songs.  I read some other reviews where they didn't watch the entire DVD because of Terry Bozzio coming on stage to do some of the tunes Frank wrote for him to perform.  Terry is what us drummers refer to as the ""Drum God"".  He is phenominal.  Also what these reviewers failed to see not watching the entire show was Steve Via coming out and playing.  He is one of the best guitarist in the world and when he and Dweezil do the dueling guitar solo is a definite highlight.  One has to realize also that the show was filmed as is.  The band never takes a break, there are a couple individuals who may leave for a few moments, otherwise it is one song after another with the only gaps where Dweezil talks a little or introduces something.  This is a feat in itself considering Dweezil never leaves the stage for over three hours.  If you loved Frank's music, love the dense complexety of his music, and have an open mind, I highly recommend this DVD as being one of the best tributes to a musician to ever be released.  I have seen the tour the second time around this year, they performed all different songs, and will be back in Portland in Jan of 2009 where I get to see them again with a special VIP pass.  They promise to do different songs again.  In case you didn't know, Frank had produce and recorded over a 110 cds, a lot of them live recdordings, but there is so much music that Dweezil's band could tour for many years before having to repeat songs.  Hopefully they will release another DVD for those who don't get a chance to see them.  I give this one 100 stars.  I shall never grow tired of this one.",1228521600,5,2370,4.247767857142857
3371176,5,B001502LNI,"I purchased the two DVDs from the Zappa site and paid more than Amazon's price for this whole set. I like the DVDs a lot but would like an easy way to play the music in my car or on my iPod.

So this is a really good deal.

Dweezil's arrangements are very similar to Frank's but, somehow, seem more easily absorbed. Cleaner. I don't know how to explain it in musical terms but I remember, when I saw them in Albuquerque in August, 2007, that the structure of Zombie Woof was crystal clear and beautifully complex at the same time. Then that happened with most of the other songs they played.

3371195,5,B001502LNI,"I was always of two minds about Frank Zappa. I thought his music was brilliant, but I found his humor juvenile in the extreme and his stage persona really irritating and geeky. This DVD captures both aspects of his work, but fortunately, the brilliance of the music comes through much more than the junior-high-boys-bathroom sensibilities. The band here is beyond impressive. They navigate the incredible complexities of this stuff as though they were playing Louie Louie. Everybody is outstanding. Even though Dweezil's stage demeanor is very low key (he looks vaguely bored most of the time), his playing is actually fairly expressive--more so than his dad's was. The sound is terrific, and above all, Dweezil's editing is fantastic. So many music DVDs seem to be edited by people who never heard the music before, with odd cuts that bear no relation to what's being played, soloists off camera, and video tricks for their own sake. None of that here. There is creativity in the editing, but always in service to the music. And in many places the editing actually enhances the music, highlighting some little accent that would otherwise have gone unnoticed or intensifying a solo. With most music videos I watch a few songs, then get bored and turn it off to come back some other time. This one kept me riveted from beginning to end. If you have even a passing curiosity about Zappa's music, this would be a great place to start. And if you're a fan, I can't imagine a better present than this.",1216512000,2,1496,4.8023255813953485
3371196,5,B001502LNI,"My band-mates and I have been going through a spell of Zappa fascination for months, so when I heard about this tour I was eager to catch a glimpse. I remember Dweezil as an MTV VJ more than a guitarist, I'm ashamed to say, but I still had pretty high expectations from the buzz. Those expectations were roundly exceeded. I nursed this collection over the course of a week and watched the final, mind-blowing segments over the Independence Day. That choice was so fitting, my joy was so complete, that I've felt the need to pass it on.

Just looking at an uninhibited Napoleon Murphy Brock while he sings and prances giddily around makes me feel free. Pete Griffin is having a total ball on bass, I'd swear Aaron Arntz hits every key on five keyboards over the course of each tune, and Billy Hulting switches from bells to bongos as if every band has a guy doing likewise. I do believe I'm head over heels in love with Scheila Gonzalez, and I am now at liberty to recognize Terry Bozzio as the greatest drummer alive in place of my previous percussion hero, the soured Brit Mitch Mitchell. Not that the excellent Joe Travers suffers from inferiority playing alongside any more than the Italian virtuoso Steve Vai is playing second guit-fiddle as he ecstatically wrestles with his tremolo bar. And yes, I'd pawn a guitar for a chance to jam with Jamie Kime. While all this great talent is worth experiencing on its own, if you really want to know where freedom can take you let me recommend this band assembled by the son of a great, truly American composer who felt personal and artistic liberty to such a degree that not only could he compose all the frenetic music I witness, but he could give his torch-bearing progeny a name like Dweezil and his song a title like ""Zomby Woof"" (a personal favorite cut).

An eternal thank you to FZ, Dweezil Zappa, and this entire collection of musicians, sound techs, and video production artists for making my lifetime. If you love music, if you have an open mind, and if you have ever believed in the potential of American freedom I recommend at least five minutes of this DVD to cure whatever may ail you. And to the square peg among round reviews who says Terry Bozzio doesn't fit, since when has Zappa music about meeting the pat expectations of the banal passing for criticism? I'm sure Mr. Bozzio will be happy to show you exactly where it fits, and my opinion is that the drum-off climax of disc two is the greatest performance of anything I've seen anywhere... and I just caught the Return to Forever reunion last month!",1215388800,2,2567,4.566160520607375

He was a genius composer, and this DVD proves it.  All of the performances are fantastic and the guest performances by Steve Vai and Terry Bozzio are just the icing on the cake.

A masterpiece!",1214352000,,353,4.287878787878788
3371219,5,B001502LNI,"No one on this planet is composing  music like this anymore. It's intricate, heartfelt, melodic, humorous, and takes talented musicians to play it. Too many people have closed their minds to Zappa's music just because of his lyrics, and that's too bad, because the music speaks for itself, and for me, lyrics are secondary.

Dweezil assembled a smoking hot band, hit the road, and now we have a document of some of these shows. This DVD has performances from two, maybe three, shows. The set list is phenomenal, although not one song from ""Joe's Garage"" or ""You Are What You Is"" (two of my favorite Zappa albums) is included. The audio mixes, stereo and DD 5.1, sound great. The video is clear and the editing is good, but there are plenty of spilt-screen shots, and the camera angle from the guitar headstock looking down on the strings, when used, doesn't show much. The video is presented in a widescreen format. Disc one is 1 hour 54 minutes long; disc two is 1 hour 34 minutes and has a ten-minute interview with Dweezil and ""Cheepnis"" as bonus features.

The only thing missing from this performance, that was routine at Frank's show, is the audience participation and general weirdness that was played out on-stage. And that's ok by me. I've had the pleasure to see Frank about a dozen times in concert and some of these theatrics were too much and I wished they had focused more on the music. You can only throw around an inflatable doll so many times before it gets boring. One gig I remember Frank did nothing but sit down in a chair facing the audience, smoke cigarettes, and conduct the band. I felt a bit ripped off that he didn't play his guitar or sing. But all I feel when watching this DVD is amazement and pleasure. This is such a killer DVD, the music is timeless, and hopefully Dweezil has sparked some interest for this music to a younger generation. Highest recommendation!",1214006400,24,1895,4.617210682492582

The footage is awesome of this super talented band that Dweezil has put together to keep the music of Frank Zappa alive.  I strongly recommend that anyone who claims to be a Zappa fan add this to their collection.  Dweezil has done it right in honoring his father's music.,1212364800,5,448,4.349397590361446

3371227,5,B001502LNI,"I picked this up of my porch as I came in from work saturday, in a nasty mood and wanting to just relax and decompress. I put the 1st DVD in the computer intending to just skip thru it and get a feel for it before I could put my mind in the right place and enjoy it. 2 dvd's later, I'm picking my jaw up off the floor in amazement. What a wonderful, masterful thing Dweezil has put together and released to the world!
  The band is incredible, a real Frank quality ensemble. Their precision playing, coupled with the unbridled fun they are having jumped out of my monitor at me. Throw in Terry Bozzio and Steve Via and Oh MY what a show. And, unlike previous reviews, I thought Steve Via brought alot to the party.
  This DVD will make it easier for me to pass on Frank's music to my kids as my 14 year old said as she stopped in, ""Those guys can play, who is that?"" As I told her, it's the son of Frank Zappa, the guy whose song titles you say are wierd, playing his Daddys music, she actually, finally agreed that maybe she needed to give it a listen. From that statement alone, Dweezil's grand plan of spreading Frank's music to a new generation is on the mark.
  Frank Fans and Parents.....buy this astonishing work and play it where others cant help but hear it. Then let the music of this great composer work its magic.",1211068800,7,1325,4.196850393700787
3371228,5,B001502LNI,"WARNING: at the time of this review, the product description here on Amazon is just plain wrong. It states that the band ""duet"" with Frank via video on the tune ""Chunga's Revenge."" Neither that song nor any other duet with Frank is on the dvd, cd, or dvd/cd version of this release.

That aside, this is an delightful release. Dweezil has selected some of his dad's most accessible tunes, assembled an utterly amazing band to perform them, toured the world for months, and captured for our video amusement and amazement the performances of two consecutive nights.

The songs are among the most popular from Frank's catalog, emphasizing the albums Over-Nite Sensation, Apostrophe', and Roxy & Elsewhere. That was a period in Frank's career when all of his skills hit their zenith together for the first time - his uniquely classical sensibility of long sections of composed instrumental complexity, interspersed with a jazzer's delight of great chord progressions underlying portions of free improvising, overlaid with pure rock band distorted tones, and pop vocal melodies, but minus most of the scatalogical explorations that alienated some listeners (and prevented radio play) a little later in Frank's career.

Dweezil's band is comprosed of mostly unknown musicians, of such a caliber that each of them could easily have been in any of Frank's bands. The one exception, and a brilliant decision on Dweezil's part, was to include Napoleon Murphy Brock on lead vocals, from Frank's band of the mid-70's, and indeed those three key albums listed above. Several reviewers have noted Napoleon's obvious delight at the performances of these tunes by this band, and his delight becomes ours as we discover what he already knows - these kids nail some of the most complex music ever written, at least in the rock realm, and make it look easy, and fun.

A couple of other Frank alumni, Steve Vai and Terry Bozzio, are on this dvd as well, but appearing in cameos in the middle and again at the end. Frankly (pun intended), these are the weaker parts of the show. These guys are phenomenal players, but part of what is so delightful about this concert is the ego-free devotion of the core band to this wonderful music, and the purity of that is somewhat disrupted by inserting ""special guest stars.""

The video production is as astonishing as the music. The average in-concert dvd is taken from a recording of the video that is on the side screens at the show, or a tv broadcast of a show along the tour. It's usually pretty well-done, but with several cringe-inducing moments where we're stuck looking at the wrong guy, such as the guitar player taking it easy while the sax player solos his brains out, just not where WE can see it. Or, just lots of shots of band members playing the song, mindlessly quick-cut mtv-style for no apparent reason...

None of that here - this video is comprised of many shots, true, and they cut from camera to camera rapidly, but it's different: every single shot is on-screen for a reason. We see the bass player when he is doing something intricate, we see the sax player when she reacts to something the drummer did, we see Dweezil as he points to who gets the next solo, we see guitar and keyboards side-by-side while they play a complex melody in unison. There's a lot of shots because this is intricate music played by 8+ musicians, so there's a lot going on, at almost all times. But not only are no details missed, but while this writer has repeatedly enjoyed many of these tunes for 30+ years since their original release, the video has actually revealed, through the intelligence of the editing, little compositional details that I had never noticed before. Amazing...

Great tunes, a fabulous band, superior video production - what's not to like? This release is recommended for those who have been lucky enough to see one of these shows, as well as those that haven't. If you are a fan of Frank's music, it is essential. If you're not, this would be a great way to get to know some great music that you've been missing.",1210723200,41,4058,4.772079772079772

I think I actually liked Dweezil's show better lol. It was as magical an evening as I've ever had. So glad that the tour was recorded and released on DVD. I can't recommend it enough.
