8252824,1,B0013TPGLK,"This video (which I've seen and not purchased) is a prime example of why I have to spend at least 20 minutes of my valuable time asking clients what their experience of hypnosis is.

But hey, I'm all for a good time. However potential purchasers should note that this is a STAGE SHOW. The participants were chosen for their ability to please the hypnotist(s). That said, if anyone is gullible enough to spend hard earned money for this, bear in mind that, even as a STAGE SHOW it is poorly produced and, I have to say, boring. Perhaps the people attending the show were having a great time, but you at home won't. Stage hypnosis is entertainment. This video was not.
