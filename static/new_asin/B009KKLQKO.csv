5344356,1,B009KKLQKO,I will not order this after reading the track listing. Why severely edit a concert that was great from beginning to end? The entire concert would easily fit on one DVD.,1351209600,11,168,4.451612903225806
5344357,5,B009KKLQKO,"How does anyone review a DVD that has not been release? I suppose if you wanted a 50 song DVD it would cost about $29.99 instead of $14.99.
I'm give it a 5 Stars because the reviews above clearly were not based on this DVD that had not been released.",1351123200,4,250,4.02
5344358,1,B009KKLQKO,"This is just plain sad,what a great Tour it Was ,yet they put together this short little ""Best Of""
with less than half the show,everthing about this package is low class",1351123200,11,169,4.483870967741935
5344359,2,B009KKLQKO,"The Beach Boys juggernaut 2012 world tour was highlighted with some exceptional performances: Bonnaroo, where the band successfully enthralled an audience three times as young; Hollywood Bowl, a triumphant homecoming of sorts, complete with the introduction of thier children's ensemble California Saga; The Beacon Theater featuring  the band's first truly 'jelled' performance without all the fleshing /feeling out that evolved early in the tour; Red Rocks, probably the most connected performance between band and audience in the US; and finally the epic 55-song London Wembley Arena show featuring an inspired, animated Brian Wilson and a band that rose to the occasion driving the point they are indeed ""The Great American Rock Band"".
Plenty of moments.  Plenty of memories.  Sadly this current offering attempt appears to only offer snippets, a glimpse of the comeback of the year 2012.  With only 21 songs, the set offers only a fraction of the real concert setlist. Missing are presentations of the show featuring underplayed classics such as ""Add Some Music To Your Day"", ""This Whole World"", ""Disney Girls"" and Pet Sounds material (a great Dave Marks' rendition of the title track and the poignant ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"").
Bluntly put, marketing geniuses should have focused on the whole, not the parts. For starters, a complete Wembley Arena  or Red Rocks performance(maybe three DVDs) might have been produced; a fourth DVD included documenting a rigors of touring for aging performers, sound checks, television performance highlights, various interviews, etc.

This offering reeks of an opportunistic effort to make a quick buck without thinking through and developing a product that fans would appreciate.  I would spend $60 on a well-packaged DVD boxed set than $15 on this abridged version of the same.  I'd rather see the amatuer videos posted by true fans on YouTube.

5344360,3,B009KKLQKO,"There has been some talk about what the songs on this dvd will be.  Well, here is the track listing!  I have said it on Facebook, and I will say it here,  The fans of The Beach Boys have been begging for a complete concert dvd.  This is only 21 songs of the 50 song set during the tour.  It seems that nobody in the band is reading our posts here on Amazon, or Facebook.  As for the quality of the dvd/BD release,I will edit the review when the dvd is available.

5344361,1,B009KKLQKO,"I saw the Beach Boys at Wembley Arena, London at the end of September and the concert was filmed. British music DVDs are generally well filmed with good audio. Hopefully when released this DVD will include the whole concert and should be a lot better than this U.S. rip-off.",1350864000,20,274,4.612244897959184
5344362,2,B009KKLQKO,"There were excellent shows done in Europe - they should have included the best performance of each song and mix theme together, US shows and rest of the world shows...  And 21 songs only??? Not worth buying - I've been a fan for 50 years and this release disappoints me! How about satisfying those who could not attend the shows!!!?? Luckily there are plenty of unofficial shows out there - even if they are not excellent audio at least they are full concerts!!",1350777600,52,461,4.554216867469879
5344363,4,B009KKLQKO,"I have only just preordered my copy , but if what the first reviewer said was true and it is a limited release of only some of the songs , it is not the best news.
However , for those of us that shared the concert experience of a lifetime , it is the best we have at our grasp for the time being.
I am sure there will be a full concert DVD and Audio CD somewhere down the track.
As it is I have grabbed as many Youtube clips as possible from the tour but the quality isn't that great.

If you are a fan , if you went to the concerts , this disc give you the chance to relive the moment again and again. We should be thankful that this is being published.",1350777600,7,654,3.7737226277372264
5344364,1,B009KKLQKO,"The Beach Boys are awesome, their 50th Anniversary tour was amazing, but this release is a rip off!  The Beach Boys performed around 50 songs at each of the concerts including many amazing rarities with beautiful harmonies.  Unfortunately, this release is lacking all of the magic.  The corporate powers that be have decided to only include 21 songs on this DVD so that they can sell more copies to the casual fans.  This ""Live In Concert"" DVD contains only about 40% of what The Beach Boys performed at each of their shows.  This DVD does not contain most of the hauntingly beautiful harmonies and wonderful music that made this tour so magical.  This DVD release is an insult to anyone who truely appreciates the beauty and genius of The Beach Boys.  This DVD does not do the band justice, nor does it give the fans what they deserve.  Don't waste your money here so that the corporate big wigs can cash in on the legacy of The Beach Boys.  The fans deserve a release of an ENTIRE show.

As a follow up in case you missed it, here are the songs that The Beach Boys performed that are NOT included on this DVD: Little Honda, Don't Back Down, Surfin Safari, Surfer Girl, The Little Girl I Once Knew, This Whole World, Wendy, Getcha Back, Then I Kissed Her, Please Let Me Wonder, You're So Good To Me, Kiss Me Baby, Come Go With Me, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, When I Grow Up To Be A Man, Dance Dance Dance, Darlin, Disney Girls, Good Timin', It's Ok, Cottonfields, Be True To Your School, Balad Of Ol Betsy, Still Cruisin, Don't Worry Baby, Pet Sounds, Add Some Music, Our Prayer, I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, Let Him Run Wild, California Dreamin, California Saga, In My Room, Surfer Girl, Forever, God Only Knows, All Summer Long, Do You Wanna Dance, Surfin USA, Barbara Ann, & Summers Gone.

The Beach Boys performed ALL of these songs, and All of these songs have been left off this DVD!  Take a look at what you're being shafted out of getting and decide for yourself if this DVD is a winner!",1350604800,295,2002,4.4103260869565215

5344377,2,B009KKLQKO,"If you can pick it up on the cheap, this DVD provides an OK keepsake from an excellent Beach Boys Tour.  Especially considering with each passing year, it seems less and less likely a full concert will be released.

However, as has been noted by other reviewers, it's not even close to a full concert.  The average setlist for this tour included just under 50 songs, while this show has just over 20.

This could have been a great document of a brilliant reunion (which is not likely to happen again), but instead it's a missed opportunity.",1499299200,,540,4.536082474226804

5344379,5,B009KKLQKO,"The Beach Boys sound G-R-E-A-T after 50 years!! LOVE this DVD, I watch it over and over. Most of the hits are here as well as some nice deep cuts and rarities, such as  Hawaii, which may be my favorite song on the DVD--and that says a lot because ALL the songs are fantastic and the energy the Beach Boys put out is great--if it was possible to give it 6 stars I would--however, and this is a rather large ""however"" Why not show the whole concert? Why cut it down to just 21 songs and NO extras! None! Really guys--come on! This DVD is barely over an hour. As good as it is it could have been soooo much better if The Beach Boys could have put their differences on hold and put together a complete 50th DVD complete with interviews and ALL the songs--I mean NO Surfer Girl, No In My Room, etc. As great as it was guys it really could have been better. In fact, the guys sounded so good I WISH you would do a 55th anniversery tour. All due respect to Mike--and I know how the fans sometimes love to trash Mike, (I am not here to do that) His version of the Beach Boys is really good--I know people who have seen them and come away quite happy and pleased--they rock for sure, but the TRUE Beach Boys are David, Al, Brian, Bruce and Mike--that lineup can NOT be topped. But again, for anyone who bothered to stay with me this long--GREAT DVD--just a tad dissipointed that it did not include more songs and no extras! But man, can those guys still rock!!!",1496966400,,1452,4.185714285714286

The old harmonies are there, even if ""with a little help from their friends."" Mike Love, Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine can STILL deliver the goods after five decades! The audience shots were also fun to watch. And we get a little sax action on a few songs. If I had to nitpick, I would only say that I missed hearing a couple of faves such as ""In My Room"" and ""Little Old Lady From Pasadena"" or ""Surfin' USA."" However, the excellent quality of the sound and the 'Boys performance more than made up for any song omissions. Buy it and CRANK it loud!",1490140800,4,692,4.5

5344394,3,B009KKLQKO,"Great audio and video quality for a large concert venue.  Happy to see many of the original members still performing and healthy.  Disappointed greatly however in the fact that only 21 songs are included in this Blu-ray DVD and each concert in their 2012 50th anniversary tour had about 48 songs and an encore.  No encore included in this disc.  Also, no information provided as to where this particular concert took place.  Produced by Brother Records Inc (San Francisco).  Should be a double disc set with all 48 songs and the encore. Very misleading when considering the purchase of this concert DVD.  Shame on this record company.

5344470,5,B009KKLQKO,"I saw this show on AXSTV a few months ago, and had to get it on blu-ray for my collection. What an awesome show!!! Of course, the guys are not kids anymore, and, as such, don't move around too much. But the vocals,man...Oh,the vocals!!! They are so perfect that you'd swear they were augmented in post-production. They have about 17 zillion back-up players with them on this disc, handling several different instruments,including bass,drums,keyboards,percussion,etc. As a matter of fun fact, during ""Rock and Roll Music"", one of the percussionists runs out to the front of the stage by Al Jardine,drops to one knee, and starts banging out a cowbell figure to rival the great Saturday Night Live bit about Blue Oyster Cult recording in the studio (""I need more cowbell!!!""). I can't say enough good things about the song selection and the dead-on vocals, albeit some Beach Boy purists will argue that they could have substituted a couple of the songs included on this disc for a couple of their more well known or popular hits, but I think that's quibbling over small potatos...It's ALL GOOD!!!",1398988800,,1093,4.9135135135135135
5344471,3,B009KKLQKO,"Well, yeah....the instruments anyway.  The vocals?  Nope...sorry.  I know what I hear, and these vocals have mostly been replaced in the studio and auto-tuned to death.  What I find amazing is is that they went to that much trouble to perfect the vocals but left in some pretty bad bass mistakes.  But heck, probably nobody but me noticed that anyway.

Don't get me wrong, folks.  There's nobody on this planet that loves the Beach Boys more than I do.  I have worshipped and studied them as long as they have been together.  I've had a career in music based on everything I learned from them.  I named my only son after Brian.  Maybe I expected a bit too much from a bunch of guys pushing 70.  Truth be told, I've been to over 30 BB shows in my life.  I heard them on their best and worst nights, but always they were totally live...no back tracks, no studio tricks.  I would have loved this album if they'd just left it alone and put it out, mistakes and all, no polish.  God knows there are some incredibly talented guys in the back line who all sing their butts off.  I guess they succumbed to the pressure to put out something that rivals every other slicked-up, auto-tuned, and mastered-to-death product you hear now.

All that said, I'm still enjoying it.  I bought it, and I will buy anything else they ever do.",1398038400,,1319,4.425
5344472,4,B009KKLQKO,"Great music, if you like the Beach Boys you'll love this video!  It was really good seeing Brian Wilson and Al Jardine preforming again.  Mike Love kinda hams it up too much and comes across like he's light in the loafers, but other than that this a great video and a must have for Beach Boy fans.",1397088000,,297,4.192982456140351
5344473,2,B009KKLQKO,"The concert itself is excellent. Excellent sound and clear image. The Blu-ray however is very disapointing. No nothing. No special features at all, no index, no bonus. And very few performances I don't know why as the double CD that I have has much more songs.

I can't believe in a blu-ray they presented only 1 hour of concert.  I don't recomend at all.",1395964800,2,355,4.53125
5344474,1,B009KKLQKO,"I watched this on TV and then I had to google ""beach boy's lip-syncing"" and lots of others noticed same thing. They are an amazing group.  Would love to see them live again, even if they are lip-syncing.  Sound is just too perfect for a live concert that age.  They sound exactly like they were young.  Not possible.  Oh well, they still rock!",1395878400,5,343,4.380952380952381
5344475,3,B009KKLQKO,"You can tell by the many copies here for a little over $2 that this isn't much of a keepsake. While it is a great piece of music history, and having so many originals on stage together is a great feat in itself, the video is choppy, and audio out of synch when using the 5.1 option. I personally didn't care if it was 21 or 40+ songs as in the live concert, what bored me is the lackluster performance, slow tempos and I'm pretty darn sure the backup band was the majority of the main mix. It looks to me (as a professional musician) that much of this is lip-synched to a studio vocal track, and definitely the smooth harmonies are not live...all incredibly dead on and pitch corrected, although with a dozen musicians behind you it is sure to be a full sound. The Beach Boys themselves don't appear to really be playing much on this, but when you are a legend...hey, you can pretty much do whatever the heck you want and they deserve it. Just don't expect much of an authentic performance on this product. Congrats that this event even happened though!",1395619200,,1053,4.377551020408164

5344477,5,B009KKLQKO,"The DVD was of excellent quality and I wish they would produce another DVD to include any songs (if any) that were excluded from this disc from this actual concert. Thoroughly enjoyed the super music. Must admit though, that from time to time, after much review, certain parts of certain songs I was unsure if lip-sync occurred. Often some of them would not be at the microphone and then they would step back in and no difference could be heard. On my very favorite song in this collection, it was almost too perfect and I watched the band clapping and they appeared not in beat with song and yet the song was perfect! Could be wrong.  In any event, this is a great DVD and I would have been thrilled to have been there in person and highly recommend it. Good work!!!",1393372800,2,767,4.401408450704225

5344487,2,B009KKLQKO,"I'm a life-long fan, but have never actually seen the Beach Boys perform. I really, really wanted to like this and believe that the Beach Boys still ""had it,"" but sadly, it's not the case. Let's be honest, the rare presence of Brian Wilson was the attraction of this tour as well as this DVD and CD. So the biggest disappointment was that Brian rarely actually sang. Most of his many, many falsetto parts were sung by a non-Beach Boy, Jeff Foskett. Per Wikipedia / Los Angeles Times: ""Al Jardine stated, 'Jeffrey is invaluable to keeping the continuity between the various component parts. He supports Brian in every possible way. He has Brian's confidence, and basically kind of makes it possible to have Brian Wilson on the road with us. [Without] that shoulder to lean on, I think it would be very difficult for Brian to tour. And I'm very grateful for that.' "" There were about five of these extra musicians, who appeared to play and sing the entire concert while the aging originals contributed when they chose to.

Brian appeared to spend the entire concert seated at the grand piano. When he sang, he was reading from a prominent teleprompter. The best part was a very touching and understated ""Heroes and Villains, with Brian singing throughout, followed by snippets of ""Sloop John B"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Nice."" This was really the only section where he showed up. I didn't know that Al Jardine sang lead on ""Help Me Rhonda,"" but he provided the only other bright spot.

The saddest part of all was on ""Fun, Fun Fun,"" the final track. Brian stood up near center stage with a bass slung over his shoulder. He sort of attempted to play, but I don't know if it was plugged in or if he was even miked up. The producers should have allowed him more dignity :(",1386028800,4,1762,4.555205047318612
5344488,5,B009KKLQKO,"This may be the last time the Beach Boys will tour together. This show is excellent. They have an absolute music machine, their vocals just soar and they don't miss a note instrumentally. If you want one Beach Boys DVD, then this is it.",1385683200,,236,4.386363636363637
5344489,5,B009KKLQKO,"A gift for my husband who loved, loved, loved this. We  may be old but the music still makes us feel young. Classic Beach Boys!!!",1383696000,,129,4.16
5344490,5,B009KKLQKO,This CD is going to surprise a lot of people. The quality of the music and vocals were amazing. These guys must have spent a lot of time rehearsing and it shows. All of the songs were done like the originals. They all sounded great. Brian Wilson was naturally the crowd favorite and he did not disappoint. He sounded better than he has in decades. Mike Love and Al Jardine were both awesome. Bruce Johnston did a great rendition of Disney Girls and his vocals were obvious on many of the songs. It was also nice to see David Marks back with the band. He is a great guitar player! The backup guys singing harmony were time warped from the 60s. This was the best live Beach Boys concert in decades.,1383436800,,696,4.320610687022901
5344491,4,B009KKLQKO,"The 50th Anniversary Concert has been scaled back to a limited number of songs. Many with the great Brain Wilson Harmonies left out. This version of the Beach Boys will never pass this way again as Mike Love quickly fired Brian Wilson and since he (Mike Love) owns the Beach Boy Name he quickly resumed touring with his band which besides Mike has only one other Beach Boy from the 60's. The Beach Boys days are numbered with all the original members in their 70's. This video should have been the ultimate tribute to a six decade career but it's poorly produced in places and gives little credit by leaving out the great music written by Brian WIlson for the Album ""Thank God for the Radio"" which is close to a masterpiece.",1381622400,,724,4.492424242424242
5344492,5,B009KKLQKO,I love seeing the Beach Boys. They r all older but they still have the magic. I would buy more Beach Boy dvds.,1380672000,,110,3.8260869565217392
5344493,5,B009KKLQKO,"Some have complained this release is not the same as the 50th anniversary concert.  It is still a very well produced video from the event with several surprises and a healthy dose of their biggest hits.  Best of all we get as close as possible today to the original Beach Boys that made the magic happen.  Having Brian Wilson at the keyboards adds a whole lot to the Beach Boys sound.

The group is aging but with the help of an army of back-up musicians they provide the lush harmonies and complex sound for which the group is known.  The hotrod medley is fun starting with ""Little Deuce Coupe"" and closing with ""I Get Around.""  The lush ""All This Is That"" was an unexpected delight. Only weaker moment is Mike Love's meek version of ""Kokomo"" -- the boys last hit.

Overall this offers outstanding videography,lighting and sound.  Its production is equal to greatess of the band.  Considering the age of the original band, this turned out to be better than expected.  The legendary Beach Boys are a joy here.",1380153600,,1009,4.58659217877095
5344494,4,B009KKLQKO,"I have to agree with others in stating upfront that the entire concert that matches the Audio-CD should be released. I would assume it was all captured. So many great songs did not make it to the BluRay video concert. This is why I downgraded to 4-stars out of 5. Should they ever release the entire concert at some date and make me buy the BR again, I still would although I would feel some resentment.

Putting aside for a moment this failure to release the entire concert on video, I have to say what was released is very good. The video looks great and sounds great. It really is a fun concert. What great songs they have released over the years. And you are seeing and hearing the Beach Boys at their best with top-notch supporting musicians. That is why this is so special. This gathering may not occur again, so let's enjoy it. Overall, I am happy with the purchase, as what they did release is great. It's just that if you also have the Audio-CD, then you know you are missing some other great performances.

I forgot to add this to the original review. On my BluRyay player, the only menu options I see are Play Concert and the Audio Setup. There is no chapter (song) selection, which is quite rare on concert videos today.

And one more note...I never knew this. My first song memory of the Beach Boys was ""Help Me Rhonda"". I see from this video that Al Jardine sang lead vocals on that song (and also confirmed on Wiki). I just never knew that and was quite surprised. Go Al!",1379894400,,1486,4.35740072202166

Discerning listeners can also distinctly hear the other voices of the Boys in the overall vocal blend and Mike and Al are in fine form with their leads and Bruce sings some fine falsettos.

I visited the Boys on their tour through Germany and was really impressed and touched to see and hear them again after manny many years. The magic was still there, they are so unique. And this is what I would like to feel again while I watch a recorded documentary of them bringing joy to the people all over the world. They did
a fantastic performance, they were so well prepared after a long time of not playing together, even of not seeing each other. And that is what made us feel so  warm that night !!! I keep that memory in my mind and in my heart and won't let it be destroyed by a ""quick money maker product"". I prefer one made with love.....as the concert was !

5344512,1,B009KKLQKO,"Now I saw the Beach Boys in concert when they visited Oslo as part of the tour, and I must say, this BluRay is a shameful representation of the concerts. First of all, it's about a third of the length of the concerts (the Oslo one that I attended lasted just over 3 hrs, including the 15-20 minute break halfway), and excludes some of the best songs of the show. Second of all, it's auto-tuned to hell, something that WASN'T done during the live concerts, at least not the one I attended, or at the ones if seen footage of on YouTube, and it ruins the sound. Mike Love sounds like T-Pain, and that's not a good thing. Thirdly, there's NO bonus footage. You are paying 15 bucks for a disc that has a shortened, autotuned digest of a concert that initially was great. How about including ""Doin' it Again""? Or rehearsal footage? Hell, they at least could have tossed in an interview or something...

5344513,1,B009KKLQKO,"This recording has a major lip sync problem, particularly the first 4 or 5 songs. It suggests that much of the vocals have been rerecorded and then they do not match the lips of the singers. Therefore this recording, although good, may not be authentically ""live"".  Early on there a lot of long shots of the band which may have bee done to disguise this obvious lip sync issue. Very disappointing.",1371081600,2,397,4.591549295774648
5344514,3,B009KKLQKO,Great sound but obviously lip synced. I was pretty disappointed with that. If they are too old to perform than why even bother? I love the BBs but they should stay retired if they have to fake it in a live performance.,1370649600,,218,4.214285714285714

5344516,5,B009KKLQKO,"First, I am a huge Beach Boy fan. I have seen this band in concert many times since 1966. I was totally impressed with the 50th REUNION TOUR and the forty plus song list that was performed. Yes the DVD has a fraction of the songs but the DVD is awesome. I purchased the Blu-Ray version and the quality and sound is magnificent. If you like THE BEACH BOYS you will like this video",1367625600,2,379,4.135135135135135
5344517,4,B009KKLQKO,I was lucky to see the Beach Boys in concert 50th anniversary edition at the outdoor Sandia Resort Casino amphitheater in Albuquerque after the 4th of July holiday. They sang for nearly three hours! I watched the DVD and I finally figured out what was going on. What is on the DVD is just the second half of the concert. The first half is missing for some reason! Hopefully someone will release the entire concert soon. The concert was wonderful watching the group with Brian Wilson joining the band. It looks like he's looking at an electronic prompter with the song lyrics. The one thing I was disappointed with is the lack of interaction of each member and also the lack of any dialogue about the songs by the band members during the show. I read that the Beach Boys have disbanded once again so enjoy what you have of the group and this DVD. I recommend to buy it and enjoy it with friends.,1366502400,,894,4.424242424242424

5344519,3,B009KKLQKO,"For starters, the music seems to have no sense of urgency. It sounds like an above average band playing at a VFW. They should have just used ALL of Brian's touring band (The Wondermints) and it would've rocked! The vocals are still stellar but they seem somewhat reserved; basically like there's no soul behind them.

The other thing that really bugged me was that it use to be bad enough watching Mike Love singing songs doing his patented ""sign language"" interpretations of each number--but, now I'll be damned, if all the rest of the guys (Bruce, Brian, and Al) don't do it too! Very annoying (and corny). While it was good to see the Beach Boys up on stage it was sad to see them ""act their age"" up there.

After 50 years of performing in front of crowds they should have enough stage presence that it shouldn't look like a bunch of old guys singing and dancing for their grandchildren. ""I get bugged driving up and down the same ol strip...(Bruce mimes an imaginary steering wheel)...""I gotta find a place where the kids are hip (then he points to--his hip!).

One last thing...somebody should have trimmed Brian's nose hairs! I'm not sure if I can watch the video a second time because the High definition makes them stand out and it really bugs me.

However, with all that being said it's still the Beach Boys and I will take the good with the bad. They're not going to be with us for much longer and I'll take every drop of them I can get! It's not the worst performance they've ever put down on tape, but it's nowhere near their best either. I just think I would have enjoyed it more if they didn't seem so damn hokey and they came across more as living legends and less like a bunch of old guys playing in a wedding band.",1363996800,3,1731,4.4
5344520,5,B009KKLQKO,"whoever says this DVD stinks is smokin sum serious crack yall. the version of 1972's All This Is That is just transcendental! Another gem from '72, Marcella, sounds great as well. David Marks really shines on this DVD. He's a greatly underappreciated guitar player who has grown exponentially since he was that scrawny 14 year old playin rudimentary rhythmn guitar in a garage band from Hawthorne, CA. Two great tunes from the new album are performed live here: Thats Why God Made The Radio and Isn't It Time. Both sound great. I did notice Brian Wilson using Auto Tune and then later, Mike Love also, wasn't above using Auto Tune (disappointed a little by this, but not enough to ruin this extravanganza 4 me, kiddies!) Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston's voices have aged gracefully and effortlessly recreate the vocals they recorded when they were much younger. Rememba Kidz, Dis reunion was like manna from heaven, so why all da complainin bout dis n dat and mike love did n dat? I am just happy they 'did it again'",1363910400,2,1015,4.707865168539326

The actual concert in Phoenix was taped in a relatively small venue (20,000) and they sang more than 50 songs. It was fantasic. They had a huge back-up entourage playing with them that produced the best ""Beach Boys"" sound I have ever heard. Even my 35 year old son was blown away.

Secondarily, I was told that one of the concerts was taped in England and that would be coming out as well. Their problem is that there's a lot of pirated stuff out there so they best get to commercial release fairly soon. I suspect that this Spring is the target date.",1359158400,4,803,4.180645161290323

The God-given talent Brian Wilson has for ""hearing"" each part that he wants each person to sing is clearly evident during their concerts. If there is a short-coming to this DVD is that it is not the entire 50 song concert only 21 songs are recorded within. Is it just like being at the concert? No, nothing will take the place of being there in person. For those of us who were not able to catch one of the 50 performances, it will have to do for now. Hopefully, a longer, full performance version of this DVD will become available.

5344546,4,B009KKLQKO,"The main issue I can see everyone is having is the tracklisting. It should be noted Mike Love is credited as Executive Producer. Unlike most of the Boys' fandom however, I believe he too is an integral part of the band,(No one really messes with John for killing the Beatles, everyone seems to blame Yoko or simply hail him as the genius of the band). You can clearly tell the concert is composed mostly of songs which Mike took part in composing or writing, or were released when he still had some creative power over the band and before Brian steered the band in new directions, except for two (yes, TWO) Pet Sounds songs, and TWO songs from SMiLE/Smiley Smile. I loved the overall product however, one can see the Boys' have fun (Brian even smiles some times :) ) My only complain (like pretty much all of them) is the tracklisting. I don't accuse any of the included songs of being bad/dissapointing, I enjoy pretty much all of the Boys' catalogue, and think they should've AT LEAST included the live renditions of Forever (Sunflower, 1970) and God Only Knows (Pet Sounds, 1966) considering they were tributes to Dennis and Carl Wilson. I would also of liked to see some more from albums that are generally ignored by the public, such as 1977's Love You (a wonderful record, in my opinion). I would also of loved to see more SMiLE live renditions, and think I would've gone broke had the Boys' planned on touring playing it entirely.",1357344000,3,1437,4.595330739299611
5344547,4,B009KKLQKO,"The Beach Boys celebrated their 50th Anniversary in 2012 by reuniting the five original members - Brian Wilson, Mike Love, David Marks (who briefly replaced Al Jardine in 1962-63, and played on the first four Capitol albums, while Jardine finished college), Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston, who is technically not an original member, but joined in 1965, after Brian left the touring band for good, stayed until 1972, took time off to write ""I Write The Songs"" for Barry Manilow, and then rejoined permanently in 1978.

I did not get to see The Boys on tour, but enjoyed the 21 songs on this DVD.  They sound great, although I'm sure there was some ""sweetening"" done in post-production.  Unfortunately, the DVD only runs for a little over an hour, and as other reviewers have pointed out, The Boys did well over 50 songs at their shows, so why they didn't put out a longer DVD is a mystery; perhaps Mike Love was afraid that a longer version would not sell.

Unless a second concert DVD with the other songs is released soon, this is probably all that we are going to get, with egomaniac Mike Love's decision to fire Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and David Marks after the tour, leaving only Love and Johnston in the band.  Not much Love shown from Mike.

Glad to see most of Brian Wilson's Band  as the backing musicans- they are excellent- as Always.

5344550,1,B009KKLQKO,"I was in the center front row of two of their concerts in Australia. Previous tours to Australia by Mike Love's 'Beach Boys' saw people walking out of the concert so I wasn't expecting 'too much'. The first concert in Brisbane was so good I dragged friends down to Sydney (600 miles away) to see them again.

The best part of this video - the backing band. The worst part - besides my blu ray copy being out of sync - the Beach Boys themselves. Unfortunately this DVD portrays a non working band, with little or no interaction between them. Five old men (were they still being grumpy with each other) going through the motions; a dysfunctional 'family' at its best. Obviously recorded at the early stages of their world tour with a 'made for TV' look - watch it once - never to be watched again.

A buddy set me a recording of the entire Sydney concert recorded on his iphone which is better than this DVD.

Dismissing the out of sync problem, for me there were only two high points. Al Jardine's voice is as good as ever on 'Help Me Rhonda' and the pick song ""All This Is That"" ironically written by Al Jardine, Mike Love and Carl Wilson from the acrimonious ""Carl and Passions"" album where Bruce Johnson 'left' the band.

One can only hope there is a real recording of the tour that will be released sometime in the future that does capture what a lot of us felt and saw in the last few months of the tour.

Knowing what I know would I buy this DVD? Yes, because I've bought everything they have ever recorded and have just about everything they ever put down in a studio including stuff that has never been released.

Is this really the worst ever recording of the Beach Boys? Other than some of the terrible uploads from phones on YouTube I think it probably is.

For me the best ever Beach Boys recording is 'Live at Knebworth' recorded in England 1980.",1356739200,4,1858,4.383720930232558

 I am disappointed because I received a big slice of the pie but I want ALL of it! I was at this Phoenix concert and was so stoked when I found out they were taping the concert for DVD. 50 songs were played and the concert lasted more than 3 hours. Come on Brian and Mike. Give us the whole enchilada! Brian, I sat behind your wife and children. What a beautiful family. PLEASE, PLEASE, you owe it to your fans to put out all 50 songs. I have been following you guys for 50 years man! I grew up in the mid 60's in the LA area and your music was so instrumental in my life. If I was bummed out, I would crank up the Beach Boys and it always put me in a better mood. I have a dedicated room with all of Beach Boys and Brian Wilson paraphenalia. It's a shrine.

After the concert in Tahoe was over he said it was the best out of all he had seen. There is absolutely no footage of that concert even though it was quite obvious it was being filmed.

5344554,1,B009KKLQKO,"I'm 56. SoCal native. Grew-up with and around the Beach Boys. Like so many of you, the Beach Boys have been the soundtrack for my life, good times and bad. Young and not-so-young.

I was THRILLED when they played the Grammys and the new album and reunion tour was announced. It was like someone threw a switch and some dark, forgotten place in my heart/soul lit back up again. I got TWGMTR the day it was released and listened for DAYS until I loved every track.

When the Anniversary Tour tickets went on sale I got set up for TWO of the Tour stops: Provo, Utah for Stadium of Fire on the 4th of July, and five days later, Red Rocks outside Denver. (side note: I had never attended a concert at Red Rocks, but it has been on my 'bucket list' for decades).

The night of July 9th was UNBELIEVABLE. The venue nestled into those red rocks almost defies description and it was going to be SRO. There were signs everywhere proclaiming the show was being filmed for a DVD. Then band came out and we found out HOW special it was going to be: many of the band's family members and lifelong friends and fans had flown in from Cali and other places to be there. Women were introduced to the crowd who had been the inspiration for several of the classic BB hits. Mike told the crowd to get comfortable because they were going to play over 50 songs (I think it ended-up being between 52 and 56).

They literally opened-up their catalog and poured it ALL out to us with love. The guys, along with the awesome supporting musicians, sang and played their hearts out and it sounded AWESOME. It was a magical, unforgettable night. The guys talked and interacted back & forth with the audience in between songs. It wasn't rushed. It felt intimate even in the midst of this massive, majestic outdoor amphitheater.

Everyone was SO psyched this memory was going to be preserved forever on a concert DVD.

So imagine my crushing disappointment when I got this DVD for Christmas yesterday...played it ONCE and probably will NEVER play it again.

I'm not sure what show from the tour this is - but I think it was earlier on before the band really started hitting their stride and peaking during the tour. They don't sound anywhere NEAR how they sounded at Red Rocks on July 9th. There is almost ZERO ENERGY passing back & forth between the band and this audience - IT IS A TOTAL JOKE. Almost NO interaction between songs...just line up a PALTRY 21 songs....omitting MANY of the biggest, classic hits.

Somewhere, the producers/directors/marketers of this concert DVD should be ASHAMED of themselves for giving us this TRASH. This DVD in NO way captures the magic I experienced in small degree on July 4th in Provo, and then off-the-charts July 9th at Red Rocks. I can only hope someone smart finally clues in to the goldmine of $$$ they would make world-wide by atoning for this by releasing the ENTIRE RED ROCKS CONCERT as a double (if necessary) DVD. If it was properly, lovingly produced and mastered, it could rival 'The Eagles: Live in Melbourne' which is my gold standard for live concert DVDs.

PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS TRASH !!! Hold-out your love & support for the Beach Boys until the powers-that-be have to cave to us and give us the real thing, not this rip-off.",1356480000,9,3249,4.54017094017094

5344558,4,B009KKLQKO,"I saw the Beach Boys live last spring before they started their 50th anniversary tour. At first I was disappointed Brian Wilson was not on stage and the audio engineer was placing too much emphasis on the guest drummer (John Stamos). I got over it and got into the groove as Mike Love and Bruce Johnston put on their charm and engaged the audience.

Lack of time and monetary resources kept me from attending any of the 50th anniversary live performances. But I easily came up with the $13 to obtain the DVD.

Yes, the produces left out half of the good stuff, but the other half is still there. Brian Wilson and Al Jardine were both there with the the other surviving original members. They're getting old, but like old friends you just want to run up to each one and give him a big hug. Brian Wilson even seemed to enjoy the spotlight from time to time.
And they still sound great!
If the producers come out with volume 2, put my name on a copy and get it to me immediately!",1355875200,4,976,4.298913043478261
5344559,5,B009KKLQKO,"This DVD is short and incomplete, yes.  BUT, to see all of the living Beach Boys together on one stage one last time brought a tear to my eye.  This tour was probably our last chance to see Mike, Bruce, Brian, Al and David perform together.  They look happy to be back, which is nice to see.  Even Brian, who as we all know has had his ups and downs through the years, appears to be in good spirits.

The set list consists of your basic run-through of hits, with a few surprises:  ""Sail On Sailor,"" ""Heroes and Villians"" and ""409.""

The fact that this band has made it 50 years and is still thriving despite  the trials is a true testiment to their lasting power and legacy.  This DVD documents a one-of-a-kind time in the Beach Boys' career, and certainly deserves a place in any classic rock library.",1355616000,3,802,4.328859060402684
5344560,4,B009KKLQKO,"i saw this show at the Hollywood Bowl this summer & was looking forward to this video.  when it was released, a lot of us complained that they did not release the whole show.  so i procrastinated about buying it.

well, i just recently got a coupon, so i picked bought this finally.  although not the whole show, what remains is excellent & fun to watch.  the audio & picture are both crisp & clear.  as a concert dvd, this is by far the best Beach Boys video.

i still wish they released the whole show (it was that good), but i guess this is better than nothing & in my mind the only song i miss is ""Add Some Music to Your Day"" without looking at the set list.",1355616000,3,662,4.046153846153846

5344564,2,B009KKLQKO,"The Beach Boys have always been one of my favorite groups. I was at their concert back in July and it was fantastic. However this DVD (in my opinion) does NOT give you the FEELING of being at a LIVE concert. It feels like you're watching a FILM of the concert that keeps jumping from one frame to the next. The picture keeps switching too quickly between the group on stage, then goes behind the group, then to the audience,then back on stage, etc. This keeps happening over and over at a rapid pace, making the viewer feel like he (or she) is only experiencing bits and pieces of the concert.

The sound quality during the show (in my opinion) is a bit muffled and lacks bass. However at the very end when the credits are shown, the sound quality suddenly gets better. I'm wondering if the sound technicians tried to doctor the audio of the concert to make the film sound better, but ended up muffling the sound instead.

We all know by now that this DVD is only an abridged version of the concert. Europe released a 2 DVD version of this show and combined the concert with the ""Doin' It Again"" DVD as the second disc. (Thank you Sonora Dick for this information. I was under the impression that this was more of the concert. I feel better now.)

On the positive side (as I DO want to at least TRY to show some objectivity),we have the Beach Boys with their great harmony. They save the day when it comes to watching this DVD. In spite of the rapid picture frames and muffled sound, the harmony still shines through,giving us some enjoyment. I guess having this DVD is better than not having anything at all.

Hopefully, whoever made this film will ""Do It Again"" and make it better the second time around. To the producers, if you ever (by any chance or miracle) read this review, how about releasing a DVD set of the ENTIRE ""Royal Albert Hall"" Concert (from London, Sept. 27) where the Beach Boys sang a whooping 61 songs!! (""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" to have a DVD of THAT show? Go to [...] and read about it. Song sets from many of their other 2012 tours are also listed.)

To sum it up,the MUSIC on this DVD is enjoyable despite (my opinion of) the sound and picture issues I discussed earlier. It's also the only available way for us experience the highlights of this great concert tour. So BUY IT and enjoy. Hopefully a better version  will be released in the future.",1355184000,7,2369,4.397260273972603
5344565,4,B009KKLQKO,"For a BB's fan since 1964, you are grateful for at least having the opportunity to buy a concert in Blu Ray (not movies, history, etc), a CONCERT. True, it's only half a concert, but...better than nothing.
Really hope that the producer hear what the fans are asking for, the full concert. I don't care if they name it ""part 2"" or ""parts 1 and 2"". I will buy it!!!!",1355097600,3,364,4.214285714285714

5344568,2,B009KKLQKO,Mike Love.....has got some real personal ego problems!  What was all this waving in a weird way throughout this DVD... 21 songs?  They did rip us off such a shame.  Not sure how about this DVD....but Mike Love has got problems. Now I understand why he fired all of them after this reunion was over so sad that he did that!  This really hurt Brian and Al who are real Beach Boys!,1354579200,7,378,4.208333333333333
5344569,4,B009KKLQKO,"As others have said, the DVD is lacking more than half the songs performed throughout the Beach Boys' 50th Anniversary Tour. That's the bad news. The good news is you get 21 of them and the picture quality and sound is superb. The direction is excellent and with none of that horrible MTV-style quick editing that usually ruins concert videos. It's not just a collection of short song clips with interviews, it IS the reunion concert, but with half the songs taken out for no apparent or explained reason. It is understandable that some songs had to be cut, but the vast array of classic songs missing in action here forced me to give this should-have-been 5-star product only 4 stars.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD. If you are a Beach Boys fanatic you will be mad about the missing songs, but you'll get over it and download some of the missing songs from YouTube. You will watch this DVD often. If you missed the tour and want to know how great it was, this DVD serves as a good sampler of what went on.

Like nearly all the other reviewers I am dumbfounded that classics like Surfin' USA, Surfer Girl, Don't Worry Baby, In My Room, Surfin' Safari, Be True To Your School, Little Honda, Wendy, When I Grow Up To Be A Man, Don't Back Down, and Barbara Ann (ALL of which were performed and presumably recorded for this DVD) were not included in the final product. The running time is a too short 68 minutes. There should have been a minimum of 45 minutes more music included.

The list price is reasonable for what is included, and this DVD makes a great stocking stuffer any time of year for the Beach Boys fan on your shopping list.",1354492800,6,1633,4.4366666666666665
5344570,3,B009KKLQKO,"I'm a lifelong Beach Boys fan and was really hoping to catch one of the anniversary shows, but unfortunately wasn't able to do so.  I was hoping this DVD would be an acceptable substitute, but in fact what it did was make me happy I didn't spent the money on tickets to the show.  I'll sum up my feelings my misquoting Grace Slick when she stated that 60 somethings shouldn't be playing rock and roll, it just makes them look stupid.  It's even worse for 70 somethings.  The music had no energy, no urgency.  It was almost like Lawrence Welk does the Beach Boys.  Not even close to the energy I experienced at the  Macca show last year.  Sorry, but no more Beach Boy live shows for me.",1354492800,,685,4.296875
5344571,3,B009KKLQKO,"Many long-time die-hard Beach Boys fans like me who attended one or more concerts on the 50th Anniversary Tour have already weighed in here about this just-released DVD version and frankly, I'm puzzled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews that many have given it. Are they really talking about the same DVD that I have?  Really? If so, I'm truly confused. The version I have is virtually unwatchable due to the the choppy, jittery video effect used throughout the entire concert. I thought maybe I just had a defective copy, but other reviewers here have also noted this bizarre decision to use a stock video production effect, usually used only sparingly to add brief moments of visual variety to long concert recordings, throughout this entire DVD. After watching the effect for a few minutes, praying it would stop but it never does, I began to suspect that Brian was playing a huge joke on us by having the DVD cases of all copies dusted with his favorite brand of acid that would be absorbed into our fingertips as we eagerly ripped open the packaging to get to the disc and provide a pleasant hallucinogenic aid for viewing the DVD. To the casual Beach Boy fan, this would seem like a totally unbelievable explanation for this bad video trip, but given the Beach Boy's long, surreal history, we true fans know that anything's possibe, right people? Another potential scenario (again, only in the bizarro Beach Boy world) might be that in order to save production costs and grind out .01% more profit, ever-thrifty Mike Love attempted to master this disc himself on his laptop with Windows DVD Maker (Apple products being too expensive) and totally botched it. The real reason I suspect this jumpy effect was used is actually more pragmatic: to purposely divert visual attention from the extensive vocal overdubbing employed throughout the entire concert recording. Specifically I'm referring to most of Mike Love's lead vocals, where for almost two hours, lips and lyrics rarely meet. I understand that it's common practice to ""sweeten"" the audio in live concert recordings with occasional overdubs recorded later in the studio, but this 50th Anniversary Tour DVD is essentially a video version of the Beach Boys' rare 1968 ""Stacks-O-Tracks"" LP which featured only background vocals to fifteen Beach Boy songs. In this case, Mike's shaky live lead vocals were often scrubbed and studio versions dubbed over the group's live backgrounds, with a video chop effect added to disguise poor audio/video sync-up. Add all this to the 20+ songs on the concert set list missing from the DVD and presto, another shoddy and disappointing Beach Boys video product(e.g., ""Doin'It Again"", ""Nashville Sounds"", etc.) compared to the fulfilling and rewarding experience it could have been (e.g.""Endless Harmony"", ""Live At Knebworth"" and all Brian Wilson solo video projects).

With all that said, are there enough magical musical moments in this DVD to make up for these technical shortcomings?  Will you be glad to have this choppy, overdubbed, set-list-half-empty DVD souvenir of undoubtedly the last time all surviving Beach Boys will take the stage together versus no DVD at all? Should you buy a copy, even if you're just a casual Beach Boys fan? Yes, Yes and Yes. If you are a real Beach Boys fan, you already know that disappointment comes with the territory: lawsuits, drugs, mental illness, death and worst of all --- some really, really bad creative ideas (e.g., M.I.U., disco-""Here Comes The Night"",etc.) Yet through it all, it all comes down to the music --- that special kind of music only the Beach Boys could make for the past 50 years. Even in the very worst Beach Boys projects (pick one: ""Keepin' The Summer Alive"", ""Stars & Stripes"", the L.A.Light Album, ""15 Big Ones"", etc.) there will be at least one or two moments of magical harmony that will make the purchase worthwhile and that you'll add to your own personal ""Beach Boy's Greatest Hits"" album. But, time is running out and who knows how many more of those moments there'll be?  All the more reason to appreciate whatever Brian, Mike, Al & Bruce want to give us while they're still with us --- while at the same time, letting them know we expect better of them than this.",1354320000,5,4237,4.921678321678321
5344572,2,B009KKLQKO,"A second underwhelming DVD/Bluray release for the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary shows in a row.

The 20+ performances missing I can deal with. They played 47 songs live (including the two encores), and the home video only features 21 of them.

Seeing the actual show in person (at the Bangor Waterfront on June 22nd, 2012) I can confirm that what you see on this video is exactly what we saw.

But the framerate is so AWFUL I am not even sure if I can watch this. Right from the beginning the entire show has this affect where it's like half of the frames are removed.

Anything moving at a fast speed (like drummer John Cowsill's arms) look like a blur, and it drops so many frames that everyone looks like they are lip synching.

I should note this is not a hardware issue. The dropped frames are a video effect that is often used by other bands for a tiny PART of a concert video (to cover up a mistake, or as an artistic effect) but not during the ENTIRE show. It's really awful to watch and I am so disappointed.

The main menu screen doesn't even have a Chapter Select where you could skip directly to a performance.

I cannot recommend this video, and the sad part is some of this live footage appears on their 'Doin' It Again' home video (released 3 months earlier), and that footage is less processed, doesn't have the framerate issues, looks more real, and watchable.

I foresee the only time I will play this is having it playing in the background while I am doing something else (and not watching the actual video). The audio is good if not very produced.

Together, the two 50th anniversary Beach Boys videos released in 2012 are my biggest disappointments this year.

Thankfully I have the live show from Bangor in my memories and some memorabilia framed on my wall.

 I,too, was unable to attend any of the concerts.  The closest one was still too far for me to travel to with my schedule so I was thrilled to get to see this DVD.  My only complaint is that it does not include the tribute to Dennis and Carl.",1354060800,4,509,4.43010752688172

The crowd shots help convey the spirit and joy that these finely crafted , timeless compositions of Brian Wilson and company inspire.

5344577,4,B009KKLQKO,"The first thing I want to do is respond to an earlier reviewer's claims that The Beach Boys sing to a studio track on the song ""Isn't it Time"". You are dead wrong! It's done live and it's wonderful as is the rest of this oh too short concert film. Why would The Beach Boys lip-sync when they have Brian Wilson's magnificent back -up band behind them literally doubling all the vocals. Not only does this allow the boys to relax and concentrate on their own harmonies but it makes for a much richer live reading of their classic works. For hardcore Beach Boy fans like myself, this concert thankfully contains a juicy center beginning with ""Heroes and Villians"", ""Sloop John B"", ""Wouldn't it be Nice"", ""All This is That"" (Which made me cry.), ""That's Why God Made the Radio"", ""Sail On Sailor"", ""Good Vibrations"" and the timeless ""California Girls"". I, like many other fans reviewing here, hope that this isn't going to be the only visual and audio record of this historic musical event that I feel so lucky to have seen this past June in Columbia Maryland. Let's have another volume of the 50th live concert, only this time include what's already on this dvd plus the rest of their 50 song play list. I'll buy it and so will all of the other millions of Beach Boys fans, it's a no brainer and everybody wins. This was a well filmed live concert, the Blu-Ray image really put you there and the 5.1 surround, although I had to crank it up, sounded really good. They all looked relaxed and like they were having fun including our national treasure Brian Wilson who never sounded so good (No lip-syncing,THAT'S FOR SURE!) My four star rating is only because it's not the whole concert. So get this dvd and hope that one day soon, the powers that be release the definitive entire set for our enjoyment in the years to come.",1353801600,32,1817,4.509090909090909

I saw two of their concerts in Southern California, including the Hollywood Bowl concert, which hopefully was recorded and will be released in it's entirety.  UNFORTUNATELY, this ""Live in Concert"" is NOT that product. This video is an attempt to rip-off the fans by giving them only a fraction of the actual concert.  It is a rip-off, and a disgrace to the legacy of the Beach Boys!  Do not buy.",1353715200,5,443,4.653846153846154
5344579,4,B009KKLQKO,"Many fans have intentionally constructed harsh reviews to punish the BB organization for failing to produce a full-show or 50 song DVD film, so many of these negative reviews are a form of critical sabotage. Take then with a grain a salt, as the product is much better and more aesthetically fulfilling than the these will opponents will allow.  Others have made more valid critiques of the photography and production artistry, and I myself was sensitized by their cautions when  I first put the show on. However:  because, despite any concerns, I was simply overwhelmed by the quality of the songs in themselves, the excellence of the performances, and the chance to see so many things that my shaking binoculars prevented me from seeing in concert.

I concede that there is a Platonic BB concert film in our imagination somewhere and perhaps even in the realm of earthly possibility, if the very best production and sound artists were in charge of every recording and filming detail.  But in its absence, I will watch this over and over; I find it intimate, detailed, bright, optimistic, loving, and warm.  I love the song selection, the directness of the performances, and the tons of lost (now found) Beach Boy Dave Marks playing monster licks.  The reality of seeing the BB performing together (and not in grainy you-tube fan videos) trumps an over attention to the details about film editing and camera angle.  Viewers will do well to disarm their plastic, Apollonian senses and give themselves over to the Dionysian intoxication of the BB music.

Added note: if you are a fan of David Marks you have to be very happy: I watch the DVD over and over just to study his riffs, some of which are historical (the parts he and/or Carl played) and some of which are invented anew. For many who embrace archetypal narratives of redemption, David Marks IS the reunion. Imagine that kindly boy from ""across the street"" who left the band at 15, now, in his 60's playing again with the BB, drawing fans to their feet with gasps of awe.  Yes, I want a 60 song DVD, and I want to see David himself leading the BB orchestra in a majestic version of Pet Sounds, but I will wait for those and cherish this DVD (the price of 2 venti pumpkin spice lattes?) for now.",1353715200,51,2252,4.6498740554156175
5344580,3,B009KKLQKO,"Having seen the Beach Boys live on their 50th Anniversary tour, I was excited when I saw there was a DVD documenting it.  However, one of the things that made the tour so special was that the group played two full sets each night, sometimes playing over 50 songs in one show.  This DVD only has 21 of the songs played on the tour and that doesn't even add up to half of the tour's setlist.  If you didn't see the tour live and you buy this DVD, you miss out on some of the highlights.

1. You won't see the touching tributes to the late Carl and Dennis Wilson in which the band backs up video footage of each deceased member singing ""God Only Knows"" and ""Forever"" respectively.
2. You won't see a performance of ""Add Some Music to Your Day"" in which all five core members of the group sing around Brian's piano.
3. You won't see David Marks play the title track from ""Pet Sounds"" solo.
4. You won't see Brian Wilson sing ""I Just Wasn't Made for These Times"" and ""Please Let Me Wonder.""
5. You won't hear some of the classic ballads like ""Surfer Girl"" or ""In My Room.""

These are the most glaring omissions in my opinion but those aren't the only performances missing from this video.  That's not to say this video still isn't enjoyable.  There's enough here to love including great performances of ""Heroes and Villains,"" ""Sloop John B,"" ""Sail On, Sailor"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" among other hits plus two songs from the somewhat obscure 1972 Carl and the Passions album which are surprising but welcome inclusions.  The band is shown in good form and the video itself is well-shot.

There are no bonus features and the DVD lacks a chapter menu so if you want to hear a specific song, you have to press ""Play All"" and use the skip button on your remote.  This might bug some people.

Overall, this is a fine sampler but should not be seen as the definitive document.  The band deserves better and the fans deserve better.  Hopefully in the future, we will see another release from the tour that gives these songs the presentation they deserve and a full concert would be nice.",1353715200,107,2077,4.41994750656168
5344581,4,B009KKLQKO,"I read the pre-views which lambasted the producers, the band, and Mike Love for making a tour DVD that represents less than half of the set list.  And to an extent I agree -- however, there are enough deep cuts and vocal re-arrangements to keep hardcore fans like me excited and satisfied and plenty of radio staples to please the more superficial fan.  I'm now watching it for the first time, and I didn't plan on writing a review until just now, as their celestial performance of ""All This Is That"" concludes.

For the militant hardcore fans, is there a redemption possible in this DVD's production?  Absolutely!  I encourage the producers to release a two-disc, unedited version.  Heck, why not?  McCartney has done it with live CDs, and I imagine others have done likewise.  Biggest rip-offs = no ""Disney Girls"" with Bruce, no ""Getcha Back/It's OK"" with Dave, no ""And Then I Kissed Her"" with Al, no ""Please Let Me Wonder"" with Brian.  As to the production value of the film as it is, just think about the wonderful live DVDs Brian Wilson has released over the past decade -- quality is consistent with those releases.

This is not a waste of money and, although it's lightweight, it IS a good concert film of the tour.  MORE DEEP CUTS!  MORE COWBELL!",1353628800,9,1254,4.624434389140271
5344582,4,B009KKLQKO,I've been a fan of the Beach Boys since I first bought the single Help Me Rhonda way back in 1965. I agree with other reviewers that this should have been a more complete concert. Don't let that distract you from buying this DVD.It's great to have David Marks back in the lineup after almost 50 years. Mr. Marks shines on this DVD.His lead guitar work is nothing short of great.

5344584,2,B009KKLQKO,"I preordered this disk after having seen the tour and held off posting a review until I received it and watched it.  I'm very disappointed, and the list of reasons is long.

 *Only 21 of the songs - that is VERY disappointing for a BlueRay
 *ZERO inserts.  Nada.  ZIP.  Nothing
 *As I watched it became clear that not only the vocals were doctored to make them sound better (expected)
  but it is a STUDIO TRACK of Isn't It Time (totally unexpected.)  I went to the concert, I and thousands
  of others LIKED IT.  There was no reason to add pretend audio if we already liked the show and bought the
  disk.

Seriously considering sending it back to Amazon for a refund.",1353369600,2,669,4.396694214876033
5344585,5,B009KKLQKO,"Do I wish I'd seen this concert? Yes. Do I wish there was twice the material here?  Yes. For the lousy 15 bucks I spent today at Best Buy am I happy with this hour plus show on blu ray ?  Hell Yes!

I can't argue with anybody who wants all the rest of the show and it seems like the last documentary DVD/BR and this could have easily been combined onto one DVD or BR but  for the price of a few gallons of gas I have a couple wonderful BR's from the 50th reunion and I'm thrilled!  Now if this BR disc wasn't 15 bucks but 30 and the DVD 25 instead of 10 ...I'd be screaming bloody murder like the other reviewers..

I'm really glad I took the chance today and bought this.... we've watched it twice already and its a very valuable addition to my collection.

Its filmed well.. the boys look like they are having fun and as I said it will enjoy heavy rotation forever.",1353369600,8,867,4.035087719298246
5344586,5,B009KKLQKO,"Is the cup half empty or half full? I think it's unfortunate when people who haven't actually seen a DVD leave negative reviews that reflect badly on an artist. You don't see an album like, say, ""The Who Live At Leeds"" getting 1 & 2 star reviews because the producer didn't happen to include over half the concert on the originally released album.

Now on to the issue at hand, this DVD of songs from The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary shows. I have seen it, and I love it! I first went to a Beach Boys concert in 1971 (December 4th in San Diego). I've been to dozens of Beach Boys concerts since, as well as a number of Brian and Al's solo shows, and the Beach Boys 50th show I attended in Irvine, CA was one of the very, very best (I would have been happy with mediocre, just to see the guys all together again, but as this DVD attests, I didn't have to settle).

The Beach Boys like the Beatles always have to strike a balance between satisfying the more casual fan and the devotee in their releases. You would see this on this tour in the set lists, in which the hits were juggled with back catalog classics like ""Marcella,"" ""All This Is That,"" and ""This Whole World."" The Beach Boys themselves couldn't see eye to eye on what to include or exclude, and of course Beach Boys fans can't either.

THE POSITIVES: The video and audio quality is, to my eyes and ears, excellent. The boys sound great. To me, the vocals of Al Jardine are the strongest of the Beach Boys these days. Now, I like many Beach Boys fans, can quibble about which songs should have been included or not. Yes, I'd like one or two of the ballad hits, ""In My Room,"" ""Warmth Of The Sun,""etc., and would love to have ""409"" replaced with, say, ""Surfin' USA."" But, every one of the 21 songs on this DVD sounds great. And for me it's worth the price of admission just to have the ""Do It Again"" intro with Jeff Foskett introducing the boys as they come on-stage and then rip into the song; and the beautiful ""All This Is That,"" one of the lesser known tracks that WAS included (along with ""Marcella""). I'm also glad they included ""Isn't It Time"" and the title track from ""That's Why God Made The Radio."" A price of $10-$12 for an excellent quality DVD with 21 excellent songs is a great deal, as is $15 for the blu-ray.

THE NEGATIVES: Sure, I'd love all 50 songs from the full 2 1/2 hour show. And while I'm at it I'd love for them to include a bonus of a set by sometimes opener California Saga (nine of the Beach Boys adult kids singing amazing versions of the Beach Boys back catalog). I'll buy a full concert version if that is released.

To sum up, this DVD is an excellent momento of one of the best shows I have ever seen.",1353283200,20,2692,4.25
5344587,3,B009KKLQKO,"For those of you who like me grew up with the Beach Boys, I've been waiting for one of their concerts to show up on Blu-ray for quite a long time.  Read many of the other reviews prior to ordering and thought I had a pretty good idea of what I would be getting.  As an owner of many concert Blu-rays reproduced on a properly configured home theater system, it's pretty easy to discern the difference between one title and the next.

Visually I would rank this 5 stars and absolutely one of the very best Blu-ray concerts that would make a great demo for your display.  According to the credits, directed by Joe Thomas, probably of Soundstage fame and overall, the camera moves and cuts are perfect for the pace/beat.  Brightly lit, warm vivid colors, deep blacks with no crush, wonderfully broad contrast ratios and perhaps more detail reproduction than the older members of the band may have wanted on their individual facial close-ups.  As good as I could have ever hoped for.

On the other side, the 5.1 Dolby HD Lossless soundtrack is another matter.  Being around the same age as the original group, I too can't do what I used to 50 years ago so I understand the whole mix was compressed around their vocal limits of 2012.  Good surround activity puts you right in the audience as expected from an audio mix from again, Joe Thomas, but there is less ""energy"" in the overall sound when you look at the number of performers and instruments in support of the original Beach Boys.  The ""punch"" in the total sound just isn't there.  LFE doesn't extend very low and while you see the drummers, the proportion of their efforts just isn't evident in the final mix.  Just compare the available bass over the end credits with what's on the majority of the tracks and you'll immediately understand my point.  Same with the high end...there isn't much almost as if it was all rolled off during the mix which is why most of the concert has almost a muffled tone to it.  Kind of like the difference in sound between AM (the norm where the band first achieved airplay) and later FM radio.  Mostly ends ups sounding all lower mid-range with limited dynamics most likely to prevent overwhelming the available vocals from the band members.

Is it still a fun watch?  Is it a good as we remembered? Is it worth owning?  Yes to all, but it could have been so much better with more a aggressive (complete) overall mix which is primarily the cause of my 3 star average overall rating.  Compare this title to a couple of my reference concert Blu-rays (Duran Duran's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Diamond-in-the-Mind-Live-2011-Blu-ray/dp/B007XNAPNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Diamond in the Mind: Live 2011 [Blu-ray</a>]; Lindsey Buckingham's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-From-the-Small-Machine-Live-in-L-A-Blu-ray/dp/B005M26ZAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs From the Small Machine - Live in L.A. [Blu-ray</a>), and the shortcoming become obvious as to what's missing similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neil-Diamond-Hot-August-Night-NYC-Live-from-Madison-Square-Garden-Blu-ray/dp/B0030BOCKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neil Diamond: Hot August Night/NYC - Live from Madison Square Garden [Blu-ray</a>].

And almost adding insult to injury, when was the last time you purchased a concert (or even movie) on Blu-ray and found there is ""NO Pop-up Menu.""  That's right, you can't call up a menu listing of the individual songs whether from the Main Menu screen or when the actual concert is playing.  While it lists Mike Love of the Boys as one of the producers of the concert, my guess is that someone else at either David C. Levy Productions or BlastMusic made the decisions for producing the final Blu-rays.  Can't imagine adding direct access to the individual songs would have cost that much more to implement when encoding this title.

Beach Boy fans like myslf will still welcome having this remembrance of their 50th Anniversary concert but it could have been as really special as the occasion was with just a little more thought and planning ($$$) spent on the final package.  As another reviewer wrote, rather spend a few dollars more and have the whole concert (50 instead of the 21 songs here) than to save a little for a whole lot less which this effort ended up being.  Too bad the rights owners didn't realize a reference quality product like this would have been an evergreen title selling over long periods of time more than recovering their small added initial investment.",1353283200,6,4621,5.295890410958904
5344588,4,B009KKLQKO,"first of all I Disagree with the other people who bash this release. this collection was great despite mike love being a giant tool box. it was nice to see Brian, AL and David on stage with mike and Bruce after all these years. brian did a great job putting in his voice where Carl would have. Brian's band was exceptional adding to the background of the show, their definitely better than mike loves group, in fact i have a sneaking suspicion that maybe the reason the others were fired by love. i know that brian and al are way better  singers than mike and his son cristain. the track listing was great a mix of everything. now heres the critique part for me, AL should have had more lead vocals and i agree with the other reviewers that this dvd should have been longer with more songs but it was indeed magical.  buy this collection its worth it",1353283200,5,850,4.339622641509434
5344589,5,B009KKLQKO,"So yes, it is something of a travesty that they represent the Beach Boys 50th anniversary tour with a 21 song DVD when the whole point of the tour setlists was to play 50 (or more) songs per show.

But leaving aside the outrageous decision to produce a 21 song package, the sound is very clean and the performances are top-notch.  The Beach Boys 50th tour could have very well turned out to be a simple victory lap, but somehow everything gelled, and the band pushed themselves to prove once and for all that they are America's most important rock band.  (And David Marks assures he will never be written out of the Beach Boys story again..)

Everybody is in good voice for the selected tracks (when Mike in particular was having on days and off days on the road), and despite the 21 song constraint, we do get some semi-rarities including a spirited ""Marcella"" a top-notch ""Sail On Sailor"" and a spot-on ""All This Is That"".  Both singles from the new album are represented, with (as on the album itself) ""Isn't It Time"" being far the superior.

I can't comment on the video portion of the DVD as I have no interest in watching concert videos -- I immediately ripped the audio to MP3.

So, accept that this is not the full magic of a show from the 50th tour.  There are ""unofficial"" sources for those.  For what it is, it provides good sound of magic performances.",1353196800,5,1364,4.467741935483871
5344590,2,B009KKLQKO,"When I first saw this was being released I was excited. That is till I saw the song listing. What the hell? I saw them twice during the tour (Berkley & Lake Tahoe) & more than 1/2 the songs they played aren't here. While one of the greatest music groups in history, be it sue happy Mike's announcement before the 50th tour even ended that he was going back to his half assed version of the Beach Boys, bad business decisions too numerous to count & just plain not being able to get along this highly anticipated video is yet another blunder. The star rating doesn't reflect on the quality of the band itself but on the quality of this package. I sure hope they release an audio version of the whole performance. A vinyl issue would be nice. For now a recording of the NPR, Rolling Stone & subscription radio shows & inferior quality audiance recordings are going to have to do till the real deal comes along.",1352937600,3,908,4.378698224852071

5344592,5,B009KKLQKO,"I saw the Beach Boys July 9, 2012 and it was awesome.  The sound was as good as any live show I have ever seen.  The Beach Boys have aged but all use their present vocal strengths to create a sound greater than the sum of its parts, that I think was better live than any other live tour they have ever done.  Camera crews were there so I was excited to be able to watch this amazing concert at home.

Since others are reviewing a product they have neither seen or heard, I am reviewing the trailer and concert I actually saw.  To get 20 some songs in perfect sound for $11 is hardly a rip off.  I do hope they release the other songs as well, but that does not take away from what this collection is-20 some songs performed by the Beach Boys and their amazing band in great sound.  If it were 50 songs, we'd be paying $30.  Just sayin'.",1352764800,5,836,4.054878048780488
5344595,1,B009KKLQKO,"Bad Vibrations...

This product is just more proof of how the Boys' Marketing geniuses totally missed the mark... again.  I saw them at Pine Knob in the summer and everyone agrees how awesome the 50th Concert was.  I knew that they were going to release it on Blue Ray/DVD.  I wouldn't have thought they'd only include some the the concert performances.  But it doesn't really surprise me.  They waited around 50 years to release stereo versions of all their earlier classic albums from Capitol.  Thanks, at least, for giving us that.  But this next blunder will force me to get a bootleg or import version of a bunch of really old songs that have been reissued by Capitol a million times.  I'll simply wait for the British version, since regardless of where you saw and heard it live, it really was a very wonderful experience to share with my son.  But, not a chopped up version that some idiot sitting somewhere deciding how many more times they can exploit such old material. The boys will get one chance to take more money from me for this great concert.  The full version is all I will legally purchase.  Screw the idiots that have been  ripping us loyal BB Fans for over 50 years! Enough is enough, and that's too much.

5344596,1,B009KKLQKO,"I grew up in the 1960's in Southern California, & am a lifelong Beach Boys fan. I attended this concert in my adopted home of New Mexico. I have attended one other Beach Boys concert here, & without Brian Wilson, it was just a mediocre show. Let me tell you- the show in Albuquerque rocked! I think it a travesty that so much great music/video ended up on some cutting room floor...

 I havn't seen the video because it hasn't been released yet. I suppose that if you didn't attend one of their last concerts, you will probably be satisfied with the final product. However, those of us who did see the concert would like to relive the memory in it's entirety!

 Since the 1970's, there has been a plethora of ""Best of"" & ""Greatest Hits"" albums released, & what I see here is more of the same old thing handed to us in DVD format. Who determines what songs go in, & which stay out? I think the fans should have the right to decide what they want to hear & see with their ""skip"" or ""fast-forward"" button!

 I don't know about anyone else, but I sure don't like someone doing my thinking for me! I would gladly pay twice the price for the full version of their concert. So, the record label want's to make more money but appealing to a larger customer base with an abbreviated & inferior product??? Well they lost my $$$, & judging by the vast majority of reviews, quite a few others dollars too!

 So how can I rate the DVD? I can't, but I can speak out against corporate greed!",1352764800,4,1476,4.284172661870503

Every song that they sing is a treasure.  So I am going to buy this DVD.  And maybe, sometime in the future, a second DVD will come out with the rest of the concert on it.  The only problem with the DVD is that Bruce was not highlighted by singing a song that he sings by himself, such as ""Disney Girls"".",1352678400,3,533,3.8623853211009176

Hello? Hollywood Bowl in their own hometown would have been appropriate, if picking just one venue. (Yeah, okay, I'm from LA.....lol)  BB fans deserve better and ""they"" (the powers that be) know we spend money on anything that preserves the BB memory (look at what we paid for concert tickets!) and this tour should have been one of those. This should have been the FULL concert, especially for those who could not see them due to limited tour venues. Hopefully someone from the ""powers that be"" camp will get wind of our bitching and correct this in the future. This is truly a disappointment.",1352592000,3,879,4.782894736842105

Even  back in 1966  the band put filler on the albums as Brian was been asked to put  album after album out with hardly a break. It's 2012 and now someone has decided that half a concert will make the fan's happy ?Another person said it looked like Love picked all the song's. It certainly looks that way. But it's not just  him , it's some dweeb in marketing, should be sacked. I'm not buying it  as its a rip off  for the band and fans ! I guess I'll wait for the extended cut.  You'd think that house in Tahoe would be paid off by now and you'd thank the fans who stood by them through all the years. this will be the first Beach Boy item that won't see my support, sadly.

I will buy this dvd just beacause I am a huge fan, but this is not a idea of a true Beach Boys fan set list.  Brian should have put Mike Love the control freak in place right from the start, got a great attorney and took back the Beach Boys name.
