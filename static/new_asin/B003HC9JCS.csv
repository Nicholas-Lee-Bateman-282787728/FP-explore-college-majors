8397004,5,B003HC9JCS,"No matter what level of Pilates you are at Michaela is thorough, clear, precise, and informative on how to do Pilates. Her years of expertise show. She knows what she is talking about. Not just how to do Pilates positions but what the positions do for you. Michaela explains how to do them correctly so as not to hurt yourself. I've learned so much from her on how to do Pilates correctly! Other DVDs have never given me as much instruction and caring. It is like she is right there guiding me through each position. Her passion for Pilates and helping you achieve a more fit body shows through her work and how she instructs you through the workout. If you work out at home, Michaela's Pilates DVDs are the best investment in your fitness. Check out her ""Pilates on the Go"" and ""Principles and Basics of Pilates"" (which is where you should begin Pilates), as well.",1332633600,3,865,4.515923566878981
8397005,5,B003HC9JCS,"I watched the videos ""Morning and Bedtime Stretches"" and ""Pilates on the Go"". Excellent! Very well done! Every move is well detailed and easy to understand, just the way I like it. I tried some of the stretches, but my back is still a little sore to do a lot. Small steps, just like you said in the video - this works for me!  I liked the relaxation chapter at the end of ""Morning and Bedtime Stretches"" - I really enjoyed that part and the way I felt after. I am so happy that you are a part of my life now through your DVDs and I can listen to you everyday while I practice and strenghten my back! Thanks so much for such great videos!",1311033600,3,637,4.055555555555555
8397006,5,B003HC9JCS,"I just wanted to let you know that you have inspired me to do Pilates again, after a long pause.  I'm glad that I picked up your DVDs!  There are so professionally done, the exercises are so well explained, the movements make much more sense now - plus I'm seeing results that I had been seeking, after only working with the DVDs for a short time.  What a worthwhile investment!  Love all 3 of them: Pilates on the Go, Principles and Basics of Pilates, Beginner Pilates - in Detail plus 2 Progressive Workout Sequences.  Your Foam Roller, too, it's such a good workout !!  and much cheaper than going for a massage!",1290297600,3,615,4.446428571428571
