5725043,5,B00CKYHHA0,"This is a great DVD for any child who loves Dora or Blue's Clues, not to say that a child won't like it if they have never seen them before!  Basically this is two DVD's packed into one with the Dora part featuring four episodes and Blue's Clue's featuring Blue in her first-ever movie!  There are also some special features afterwards starring Blue.  My daughter (2 years old) loved this DVD and couldn't get enough of it as Dora and Blue are her favorites.  It was a nice change for us too since the only Blue's Clues we have is on old VHS tapes!  I love that we can watch a little bit here or watch a whole movie.  The shows both also feature great lessons for young kids.  Also, I should note these are not new for either character as they have previously aired on television but they are new to this Double Pack DVD!

I received this DVD in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1377216000,2,885,4.25748502994012
5725044,3,B00CKYHHA0,"This ""Double Pack"" includes two Nickelodeon DVDs that are no longer in print: ""Dora's Musical School Days"" (2007) and ""Blue's Clues: Blue's Big Musical Movie"" (2000).  The former serves up four episodes (""La Maestra De Musica"", ""Boots To The Rescue"", ""The Happy Old Troll"" and ""A Letter for Swiper""), although only the first one really seems to center around music.  The other three have plenty of familiar songs but not much else.  ""Blue's Big Musical Movie"", on the other hand, is a direct-to-DVD movie that features Steve, Blue and the gang (including ""G-Clef"", voiced by Ray Charles) as they put on a show in the backyard. It's fun, entertaining and educational, and it's obviously the more worthwhile of the two.

As far as the A/V presentation and extras, they're a little dated and disappointing.  They look a little soft and are framed at 1.33:1, but at least this represents the original TV aspect ratio and broadcast look of these slightly older kids' shows.  ""Blue's Big Musical Movie"" also has a few interesting extras including a short behind-the-scenes featurette and a few music videos, while the Dora DVD only includes a dated preview of the ""Wonder Pets"" show.

So you get two DVDs, but only one of them (in my opinion) is worth watching more than once or twice.  Still, there's a good chance you have a Dora fan in your life, and they'll probably love it.  Overall this bargain-priced ""Double Pack"" is a decent value.",1376179200,5,1435,4.8244897959183675

8582876,5,B00CKYHHA0,"Bought for the nephew; he hated Dora but he has watched the Blues musical so much that we can all hum the music now. That's a good thing though, because when he's watching this, he's dancing around and humming and playing. And *not* destroying my house.

Basically if you're not sure if your kid will like Blue or Dora, try this out, it's not a waste of money either way.",1458345600,,371,4.3
