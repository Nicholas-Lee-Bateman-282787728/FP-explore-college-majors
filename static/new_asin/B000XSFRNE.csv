8229339,1,B000XSFRNE,"Don't waste your money on this version.  The slim case is very flimsy and breaks easily which also allows the disc to become easily scratched.  The audio quality is laughable.  It's far worse than the faded version I watched on cable television.  Every single pop and crackle comes through making it hard to hear some of the dialogue.  The picture quality is faded and shows every single scratch and streak.  The dvd plays like it was recorded directly from the poorest quality version aired on television.  I couldn't even finish watching ""the shooting"" to see if the movie was badly edited or if it was the complete version.  This version doesn't have a menu to select which feature you want to watch, it just starts playing with ""the shooting"" first.  Extremely disappointed.",1260316800,2,778,4.833333333333333
