8228536,5,B000XJD3EI,I don't typically like Anime but this is an exception.  If you like interesting story lines and character development then you will like Mushi-Shi~,1363132800,,147,5.125
8228537,5,B000XJD3EI,"Mushi are living organisms in their purest form. Ginko is a Mushishi, a man that studies the Mushi. Not everyone can see Mushi. Those that can are either scared of them or fascinated by them. Ginko travels the country helping people who have encounters with the different varieties of Mushi.

Each episode of this series is a different story. Ginko's travels lead him to many people that need his help. I am blown away by this anime. The animation, music, and plot are all superbly done. I can't say enough good things about Mushishi. I hope you check it out. It's great that Funimation put this title in the SAVE edition. I think that's the cheapest way to buy the complete series, so I would go that route instead. It's a steal for the money.",1354752000,,744,4.511111111111111
8228538,4,B000XJD3EI,"Ginko, a Mushi Master, goes around ""hunting"" for Mushi.  Mushi are supernatural forces which can appear within any object, place, or thing.  Some mushi are good, some bad, and some somewhere in-between.  In these 4 episodes, Ginko visits Miharu and Suzu, a brother-sister pair living out in the country.  Suzu is concerned about Miharu having slept all winter long without waking up once.  Ginko meets Kaji and Kaji's mother, Sayo, who has deteriorating dementia.  They live in a fishing village or out in the country too.  I almost got Kaji and Sayo mixed up with Suzu and Miharu.  In another adventure, Ginko meets Aya Tozawa, who tells Ginko the story about her missing twin sister, Ito Tozawa, and their travels to Jiisama.  In the last of the 4 episodes, Ginko searches for a painter after observing an eye catching cloth hanging outside a store.  He meets an artist named Kai and a newly adopted Toyo in Kai's hometown.  Each encounter has different drama unfolding.  It feels like the episodes are different stories that are just there to fill up the series rather than interwoven together, especially with so many different characters when compiling all the episodes into one group.

In these episodes, it is assumed that Ginko just shows up at the different locales presented.  Each episode is not necessarily connected to each other.  I have not seen the beginning or later episodes, so it's hard to say if there are connections within the entire series.  All the episodes in this disc take place in a rural area.  Part of the reason for this is the slow pace of the anime and the artistry fits in well with a rural environment.  The visuals play such a role in Mushi-Shi that there are many times where the vegetation is radiantly beautiful.  The hardwood floors seems like a floor that we are actually walking on.  It would be worth it to watch the videos just to look for the organic artwork and feel it is that breathtaking.  And I am not even an artist myself!

Each opening and closing of each episode is constructed differently.  A photographer was used to help with the opening and closing sequence scenes.  On the DVD extras, there is an interview with the musician and the photographer for the series.  At this point in time, the series has only been completed up to this disc.",1327104000,,2297,4.711055276381909
8228539,5,B000XJD3EI,"Mushishi is an absolute masterpeice. It's a fantasy/drama unlike any you'll ever find, and it's my favorite anime.

Each episode tells a different story. I thought I would be bothered by this, but I wasn't. This adaptation is very faithful to the source material.

Mushishi evokes many different emotions while viewing it. Some episodes may have a really nice ending, while others can be really sad. The beautiful background music amplifies these effects.

The music is very serene. Listening to the OST, something I do everyday, is the best way to relieve stress. It really works wonders for the anime, especially when considering the quality of animation maintained throughout all 26 episodes.

I have yet to see an anime series animated as beautifully as Mushishi is. Everything was so well done, you can tell they spent a lot of time translating this from the manga. The Mushi are reminiscent of the creatures you would find in a Hayao Miyazaki film, the Kodoma of Princess Mononoke perhaps. They have a certain magical aura, a mystifying presence, that makes you want to see more and more of them.

I suggest you buy the DVDs, which come in a very nice package with lots of extras. This is an anime which should be seen by anyone who enjoys anime.

This DVD contains episodes 15-18",1203292800,2,1286,4.796380090497737
