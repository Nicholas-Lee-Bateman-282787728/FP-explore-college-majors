8023870,2,B00028G6YE,"I've loved computer animation since I was a little kid, and own several collections of short films. This one is very lackluster, with only 2 titles, ""Crocotires"" and ""Horses on Mars,"" being the slightest bit enjoyable (they're actually quite good! The rest is rubbish, and I cannot recommend spending any amount of this collection.",1348272000,,331,5.148148148148148
