I enjoyed the progressive jazz song done with Diane Reeve's back up band ""A Fine Madness"" titled ""The Holmes,"" which sounds like RTF (the  electric piano & drums) meets Weather Report (the synth, bass, & percussion). Billy Carrol on bass was INCREDIBLE and the talking drum on the song ""The Holmes was cool!",1497484800,,420,4.6
