368258,5,630180256X,First I have to say thank you to Amazon for having this movie. I have searched forever for this flick. This movie was very inspriring for me. It is romantic and funny as well as serious. It's not just for the punk era  it's for anyone and I would definetely suggest seeing it. The music is  wonderful and the actors and actresses are wonderful. A very touching film.  Loved it!,919987200,,377,4.357142857142857
368259,5,630180256X,"This is a film which closely rivals Cox's ""Sid and Nancy.""  In many ways, this is a much more superior film, not looking toward a fantasy within the mind of a self-destructive punker, like ""S&N,"" but  rather a look at a lifestyle of emptiness which is very dangerous and real!  This film has some wonderful acting, and high drama (especially the  ending).  A must-see for a little-recognized movie!",918086400,2,398,4.794117647058823

368276,3,630180256X,"I actually haven't even watched this yet. But I had a VHS many years ago and watched it endlessly. However, I'm not sure how ell the film holds up for me now. Started to watch it and found it less than inspiring. Not quite sure at the moment.",1453161600,,242,4.0625
368277,5,630180256X,"Firstly, let me address the previous reviews about people being disappointed in the fact that this movie was not a biographical film about Michael Hutchence. If you read the description of the film you would have already known that before buying. That said, another complaint was the quality of the film itself; this is an old movie, plain and simple, and I do not feel that the quality of the re-mastered version is in anyway a bad one. It has the same look and feel as did the film as I saw it from the old VHS version, and as most films of that age had, o it was actually quite well done.

We watched this on our XBox 360 and had zero issues with it playing correctly as a region 1 DVD should play. The DVD read and played back perfect.

This was a film that I have been waiting and hoping to be released on DVD for MANY years and now that it finally has been I'm happy that I found a copy and purchased it. It is both funny and sad, yet very sobering as to the culture of the time and how fragile life can be. I honestly wondered that upon watching this movie after so many years if it would have the same impact or effect on me now that I'm older, or if it would jut be one of those movies that was remembered in a more nostalgic way and was not actually as good this many years later. It i still just as good, for me, as it was over 20 years ago when I first watched it in a friend's living room on an old beat up VHS version.",1448323200,5,1432,3.986062717770035

368294,5,630180256X,"This is a review of the Hen's Tooth Video 2 disc DVD release of Dogs In Space, which I was really happy to find here as I hadn't heard about it. And what a nice package to not hear about. I've just finished watching it all, and of course I've never seen Dogs In Space looking better. This is definitely a worthwhile replacement for my old PAL DVD and US VHS copies. It's a new transfer of the movie which has been restored from the original negative at 2.35:1 aspect ratio (having black bars on the top and bottom of the picture displayed on a widescreen 16:9 TV), and audio options include Dolby 2.0 and 5.1 Surround as well as 2 different commentary tracks. This with 2 trailers for the movie are the first DVD. The second disc includes a 98 minute documentary on the Melbourne punk scene of the 70's, a 20 minute behind the scenes documentary on the making of Dogs In Space, 2 music videos and a short subject titled ""Punkline"". Altogether an impressive package; I wasn't sure if I'd ever get to see the movie in anything other than an ugly 1.33:1 pan & scan, now I have a really nice looking and sounding copy of the movie with all of this background information.",1424563200,8,1167,4.3577981651376145

Now then, you may have guessed by now that I really like this movie, actually it would have to be my favorite of all time.  I do find it difficult to put into words why it is my favorite; it could be that there is no other movie I have ever seen like it.  Every time I watch Dogs in Space I see or hear something different, and i really do not know how many times that is!  Dogs in Space is filled with raw emotion, laughter, edgy music and some amazing clothes!  I'm not going to get into what it is about, you can get that from the description.  I will say it is far far far from mainstream film with a style yet to be duplicated.  I have been I fan since I saw it in Melbourne, Australia in 1987, then I came home to the US and saw it's release here; then I paid $100 for a new copy of the VHS.  At last the DVD is here!

368298,2,630180256X,I got this movie when they said I would the only bad part is it does not play on my playstation 3 . So when I read the info it said it would play on American DVD players and did not,1410220800,3,181,3.4390243902439024
368321,4,630180256X,"I remember when this played very briefly in US theaters during the heyday of Michael Hutchence's career, then disappeared for decades and, unlike most of the 80s punk cult movies (""Smithereens"", ""Sid and Nancy"", ""Repo Man"", ""Suburbia"" etc.) never seemed to make it to home video.  Finally was able to see the movie after waiting 20+ years and enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  The events in the film are supposed to be set in 1978 Melbourne.  I can't speak to how realistically the filmmaker captured that setting, but the look, attitude, costumes, character types (gothy girl, androgyne, fey synthpop fashionista, Bowie-influenced band dude, etc.), and general attitude are pretty representative of punk house life and the early 80s punk scene in midwestern USA where I grew up, including some unfortunate drug and heroin use.

The punk house here is party central; the ""Dogs in Space"" band and most of their friends are focused on having fun, escaping what looks like a stultifying home life with prematurely old parents (though they don't hesitate to turn to their mums when they need food, clean laundry, or comfort after a fight with their partner), and making some money to pay for rent, convenience store goodies, and drugs.  Most of my punk life took place prior to 1985 and I remember it being about fun, money, music, and playing dress-up, just as shown here.  Past 1985 or so, US punk/ hardcore morphed into either more serious political activism a la Dischord Records (in contrast with the politically active characters in this film, who are either chuckled at behind their backs or are using politics as an excuse to talk others into bed), or more dysfunctional families of throwaway kids a la ""Suburbia"", before descending into the commercial realms of Hot Topic and Green Day.  But back in my day, it wouldn't have been unusual for punk kids bored and looking for some cheap entertainment to drag their TV and entire living room into the street to watch old movies, just to make something fun happen.  The soundtrack music also has more of a true early 80s sound than half of what you'd hear on any given 80s night, and the final scenes of Hutchence's now-matured character dressed in a big suit and singing earnestly a la David Byrne were spot on.

My only small complaint was that the film didn't provide much in the way of exposition - apart from seeing that Sam, Anna and one or two others have old, dull (but loving) mums whose lives revolve around church and housekeeping, and letting the unnamed, very young ""Girl"" who turns up on the doorstep tell her tale of a warped relationship with a middle-aged man, we don't quite get how most of the rest of the cast ended up living in a crazy punk house, especially the serious engineering student ""Lucio"".  He doesn't seem to be into punk or partying so why is he living there?  Was there a student housing shortage?  Was he just hoping to score with one of the hot punk girls - and why is this so difficult for him when they are constantly dropping by his room?  Likewise, I would have liked some insight into Anna and Sam's relationship other than the fact that they are both pretty people, she pays all the bills, and every time he sees her whether in public or private he throws her down on the floor/ ground and starts wrestling/ making out with her.  She seems like the type of person who wants to have a real conversation once in a while, or more maturity in her life than Sam is providing, yet she stays with him - why? Leaving some details out makes sense when you're seeing all these characters through the haze of a nonstop wacky party, but it thins out whatever plot there is, leaving a blurry, ephemeral snapshot.

Side note:  I found it a little spooky how much Saskia Post physically resembles a younger version of Paula Yates - almost like an odd foreshadowing.",1404864000,2,3850,4.648011782032401

368328,5,630180256X,"The working class suburbs of Melbourne, circa 1978.  One could see it as an equivalent to 70s London.  In an overcrowded house full of early 20-year-olds, one can 'feel' the general malaise that the young are feeling at this time.  The characters are all a bit crazed (after all, this is the punk era, and the band lives here, along with others). The world seems to be falling apart, not only economically, but Skylab is about to crash - somewhere.  David Bowie is the messiah.  It's just anarchic.  Even the engineering student (who ardently studies over all the chaos) has relationship problems.  What one element always seems to 'help'?  Drugs!

One of my fav punk-rock era movies!  It stars Michael Hutchence (late INXS lead singer) and Saskia Post.  (Besides, it shows the love punks had for David Bowie!)

It has no historical figures (like Cox's ""Sid and Nancy"", ""The Doors"", or the great ""Control"" - about the late Ian Curtis of 'Joy Division'), but it does show the craziness and climate of late 70s punk/rock.  The entire plot is as anarchic as the era.  It is mostly a mixture of small stories which culminates in its final scene.  It's not supposed to have a pure, easy-to-follow plot, AT ALL!  That's the point, and I believe the director, Richard Lowenstein, meant that to be the case.

Well worth a look!  Great music.  Too bad Hutchence didn't do much acting - some would probably say, ""Thank God!"".  He does have a screen presence (just look at any INXS music video).  But the movie is just not about him, even though he could be considered the main character in the movie.  He just happens to be the lead singer of the fictional band in the movie, 'Dogs in Space', hence the name of the movie.

4 1/2 of 5 Amazon stars.  Do not watch it thinking that it is all about Hutchence's character.  It is NOT.  You'll be disappointed.  It is about the general malaise of the youth of a particular time.",1384387200,7,1912,4.563421828908554
368329,5,630180256X,"I saw the theatrical release in the 80's and it made a huge impact on me. So much so that when the only indie theater in my city at the time had a 'request list' of cult films to show on  regular basis I had all my friends write in this film- and we'd see it at midnight every Wednesday- high school first classes Thursday be damned!

It's a romantic film, and on par with great film biographies of artists and offers up a distinct and unique slice of late 70's post-punk culture that is sadly underrepresented and applies beyond the setting of Melbourne.

This film is the precursor to films such as Trainspotting - and anyone who's seen that film would admit - it isn't for everyone. There's drug use, underground music, a cast of colorful characters and many creative techniques used by the director. I suggest going on YouTube if you haven't seen this film and checking out vignettes. Judge for yourself. I am very glad that this is available now.

I dated a girl from Melbourne a few years ago and she showed me a link to the party house used in this film on a Real Estate website as it was up for sale at the time. She also gave me a copy of the soundtrack which I'm grateful for as I'd only had it on cassette.

Hutchens is bearishly charming, and it is poignant to watch this film now given his untimely demise.

I hate to write this since Hutchence was in it & I'm such a fan, but I thought the movie was meaningless & totally ridiculous.  I guess you have to live in the slums or be a heroin addict or both to understand or enjoy this movie.  All of Hutchence's dialogue is mumbled, incoherent or just plain stupid.  Nobody talks or acts like that unless they're mentally slow, which maybe the character Sam was.  I still cannot grasp the plot of this movie or that there are people anywhere in this world that live like that or act like that.  The screaming of the title song over & over was not music to me.  I am going to sell my copy back & try to get some of my 30 bucks back.  RENT this movie 1st if you can.  If not, save your money, there is so much better things to buy with Michael Hutchence in it.

Director Richard Lowenstein is rumoured to be planning to release the movie on DVD in the latter half of 2006, but apparently the soundtrack will NOT be close on its heels.  Due to negotiation issues with INXS, band of the late Michael Hutchence (who plays the lead character of Sam Sejavka), who knows when the music will follow.  However, it is said that there will be a lot of musical extras on the DVD, perhaps more than making up for the soundtrack release issues.

I personally look forward to this movie and can't wait to see it again.  Great movie for folks interested in the 70's Australia punk music scene, sociology, substance abuse, interesting characters, even for Michael Hutchence's performance or Richard Lowenstein's directing.

368395,5,630180256X,"Dogs In Space by Richard Lowenstein is better and far more intriguing than many, many indie films I've seen in years.  I remember when the movie came out and at the time, INXS (the REAL INXS w/ beautiful Michael Hutchence) was hitting their peak of their success.  Then this came out in a few art houses and immediately became a cult film amongst students, former students, anyone who remembers being the ages between 16-20.  However, this is not a 'teenage film'.. it's a fantastic portrayal of the Melbourne Punk scene in the late 70s, based on the true life story of ""Sammy No-brain"" as he was called; the lead singer of the underground Aussie Punk band ""Dogs In Space""... so perfectly played by late-great Michael Hutchence.  It's full of fabulous wild parties, naughtiness, disheveled and very interesting squatters, rogue kids, homeless bands, casual sex, cool punks, some normal kids, great music, great scenes, etc.  You can't help but feel that you're looking at something you shouldn't, there's a very real feel to this film. Very funny Aussie humor that's so attractive, you won't ever get bored!! If you had any sort of young life, you will definitely see yourself in here somewhere.

Michael does an amazing job, sometimes too well, which adds to that great edge of the film.  There's no teeny bopping in this, it's raw and fascinating and you'll fall in love with every character.

368397,5,630180256X,"`Dogs in Space' is set in what may be considered the initial decay of the punk/anarchistic subculture in Australia, 1979, and opens a at ticket stakeout for a David Bowie concert. It follows the lives of several people living in a communal style household, relatively secure in their closed, but tolerant, world of drugs, gigs, parties, television, music, destruction and (for some) sex.
The relationship between Sam (Michael Hutchence) and Anna (Saksia Post) forms the main focus of the film but is only a part of the kaleidoscope of people ranging from sociopaths to hippies. Sam, on the surface, is an unambitious, incoherent, primitive `junkie' who is the lead singer for the household band `Dogs in Space', but, underneath this it seems that his ambitions are truly bourgeois, as revealed in his generally disguised concerns for money. Anna, the only person with at least some employment, carries the most positive possibilities of the lifestyle, totally tolerant/forgiving and appearing of happily carefree. Luchio, the resident student, is studying for engineering exams amongst the chaos and problem of an attached one night stand, Leanne. Tony and Clare are a hippie couple who live on the second floor along with Grant, a poor playboy with a string of beauties, and Tim a cool geek if ever there was one. Everyone else seems to live in the lounge crashing out in front of the tv. The girl (Deanna Bond), arrives on the doorstep the first morning, having run away from home and soon after begins exploring and experiencing the lifestyle in a strangely voyeuristic fashion with the quasi guidance/protection of Anna and her friends.
These overlapping lives continue on their shaky way relatively unscathed until the night that Skylab falls back to Earth. Amongst the confusion of a house party and its aftermath the household seems to break up. Anna's death from a heroin overdose after deciding to try it for the second time with Sam shocks and devastates the household, signifying the end ultimate end of their `endless party' and lifestyle. The police step in, after having repeatedly overlooked them, enforcing an overdue eviction notice. The end of `Dogs in Space' briefly follows Anna's funeral and shows a maturer Sam, now polished and successful singer.",1066780800,12,2269,5.102150537634409

The PAL version available will play on an XBOX360 so might play on other players as well.  However, I can not check this.  The xbox is the only one that I can promise it will play on.  This movie is not available in the United States and has never been offered in the NTSC version.  It is Pal only.  It was released in Australia about 8 years ago for a short time.  The quality is decidedly better then the VHS version but remember it was an indy film produced in Australia in the late 80s.  There are 2 CD versions, a German and a Japanese release.  They have extra music on them that were not on the tape and record.",1065312000,23,791,3.9808917197452227

I remember finding the soundtrack (on tape), used at a record store.  Damn  if I haven't worn it out in the 10 years that I've had it.  I'm not a big  Michael fan, but even he did a great job in this movie.  Brings back those  incredible teen-angst years (minus the heroin).  But I agree, this would be  wonderful to have on CD.",958348800,3,466,4.134831460674158

When I saw this movie, it made me want to be one of those kids hanging out with Sammy and Anna in their funky house.  I wanted  to be transported out of bourgeois suburbia and find myself in Melbourne,  sleeping on their floor while a goat wanders nearby. *sigh* It has been ten  years since I stayed up until 4am to tape this movie of Cinemax. That copy  was played to death and I knew every word by heart. I had the soundtrack  and listened to it ad nauseum.  I'm not a miserable 17-year-old anymore,  but what do you think: should I buy another copy? Yeah, I think so, too.",956448000,6,668,4.32258064516129

Michael Hutchence as Sammy no Brains and Saskia Post deliver outstanding performances and the movie just gets better with every viewing.

This was THE movie back a decade ago, wsan' it, for those of  us in the later stages of high school.  so, we pop in the tape and I had  not seen it almost ten years, and the film, especially Michael's  ""Sammy No-Brains"" performance, still generated that tug at the  heart, mind and yes, groin that it always had.  and the final scene--Anna's  trip through the house, sill made me tear up. This was what you wished your  life was like when you were 16, 17.  And now, all these years later, when  you are older, and have lived some of ""that life"", you can relive  it again and see it through different eyes again, and regain some innocence  while you're at it.  Had to order another copy, because the old one from 12  years ago was so mangled.  cheers!",953942400,3,912,4.209302325581396

368466,5,630180256X,I first saw this movie ten years ago. Thought is was a great story of the times. Excellent soundtrack. When I purchased the video it was priced at $80.00 an well worth it. The whole party atmosphere of Jamming all night and sleeping till the afternoon. Living for the music. The fans are in  desperate need of a re-release of the soundtrack.,952819200,3,341,4.5

The subject is strong and frightening, and you feel drained at the  end, but it is more than worth it. It is comparable to Trainspotting in a  lot of respects, and if you enjoyed that film then you should enjoy this  one.",920851200,2,376,4.3428571428571425
368470,5,630180256X,"It hit home in many ways.  Many of the characters had similar values and characteristics of my own life.  I was luckier than some of the characters because I grew up and sobered up before the drugs got to me.  The music is  good too.  I have searched not only for this movie, but the soundtrack as  well over the years (10), unsuccessfully.  Would buy both in a heartbeat  for naustalgic reasons if nothing else.  I also feel it is a good learning  experience for teenagers who are experimenting with chemicals, to see what  really could happen if their drug use gets out of control.",920764800,2,583,4.457142857142857
