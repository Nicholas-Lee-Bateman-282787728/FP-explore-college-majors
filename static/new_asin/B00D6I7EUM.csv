The stalker had gay mannerisms,  so why did he want Lisa exactly? It wasn't believable that he wanted her being that he was gay. There's nothing wrong with being gay, just have a more believable actor play the part even though he's cute. Let just say no one in this movie could act at all. The phone scenes was dumb! Why did it sound like the person on the call was in the room? The only time the sound of the movie had quality was when the music was playing. When the stalker stabbed the guy in the car, you can clearly see that the knife was 8 inches from him and never made contact. Then his friend passes right by the guy? Co'mon son! Only part I was happy about was when the THOT, money and car borrowing, non loyal, cocaine sniffing, repugnant acting skills, and an all around mess of a friend got killed. I have never so ecstatic in all of my life! The ending was horrendous! Who ends a movie like that? I hope the person who wrote and directed this movie learn a great deal on how not to make the worse film in life.

5775422,1,B00D6I7EUM,"So many things wrong with this film.  The script is essentially dialogue one would overhear at a basketball game or the mall.  Its difficult to believe someone actually sat down and wrote this thing.  Theres nothing creative, interesting or imaginative about the plot.  I only watched this because the reviews were hilarious and I love D movies from time to time.  My Boo did not disappoint.  A few things to consider:  Strawberry, Lisas best friend is extremely annoying.  Cant act, seems like she wrote and/or ad libbed her own lines and just acted as herself. The stalker guy wasn't at all believable in his role.  Sorry, but he doesnt seem like hes into women and he appeared too sweet to harm anyone.  Too many of the scenes dragged on for no reason.  Why would I care that someones doing laundry? They spent at least 5 minutes forcing us to watch people doing the most boring household chore imaginable.  Why did Lisa have DJ turntables in her apartment?  Obviously, the person who let them film in the unit already had them, but it was pretty funny.  They end up having a party and lo-and-behold a DJ ends up spinning records.  Shes pretty funny to watch in the background because its so over the top.  As others have mentioned, the audio sucks.  There are waaaay too many scenes where Lisas on phone calls.  Again, why do I want to hear or see someone having the most mundane conversations known to men?  I can walk down the street and hear a plethora of calls going on at any given moment.  Hey Lisa, what you doing girl?""  ""Hey Strawberry, nothing.""  ""Really?  Well, whats that guy up to?  You gonna see him again (insert about five f-bombs)?""  ""Girl, you're crazy.. no. ""Ok, girl, well bye.""  ""Ok, bye."" This goes on and on throughout the movie.  The worst part about these phone calls is 1) the phone rings like a landline, not a cell.  2)  The voices aren't altered to sound like an actual call, instead the ""caller"" is obviously in another room and they think we're too dumb to notice or care.  3) Sometimes, the callers voice is louder than Lisas and vice versa.  My favorite scene was watching a full grown man be kicked in the butt a few times and fall unconscious. He then ended up in the hospital because of this!  So funny!  This same man (her boo) is THEE worst actor in the entire movie!  So, so bad its funny.  Movie ends very abruptly, as if they ran out of money (or time) to finish.  Its a very dull and lackluster story with actors that match.",1434758400,8,2470,4.47191011235955

5775510,1,B00D6I7EUM,"""My Boo"" teaches viewers how a bad movie should be made!  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" was definitely an inspiration, because this film is so bad...you can't stop watching/yelling at your monitors (Thank God I didn't buy this movie) until it abruptly cuts off.

Lisa easily wins ""Stupidest Lead Character"", for all the grief she gives her boyfriend..she falls for someone that she KNOWS is stalking her.  Once she (finally) sees the sign in his bathroom, she ignores it and then takes him to her place to crash (huh??).  The violent scenes were the funniest/worst ever shot.  A guy dies after his attacker thrusts a knife at him (but not IN him) several times. His buddy walks RIGHT PAST THE KILLER, on his way to the car  Another guy falls unconscious after getting kicked in the butt from behind (and then, kicked softly a few times in the side).  He calls Lisa to say he's in the hospital, but does SHE care??  Heck NO!!  She's got a creepy stalker, and so what if he insults her BFF behind her back...He's A-OK in Lisa's book.

 I got a headache from turning my volume up and down, because the Sound simply sucked!! And WHO was being smothered with a pillow, only to turn up alive and well in the next scene??  When the writers ran out of storylines to screw up, you the viewer will be treated to a 5 hour (ok, 5 minutes...but it FELT like hours!) Montage...filled with parts of about three scenes, cut up and scrambled to keep you totally confused.  OOPS!!  I almost forgot to add a Star, before clicking ""Submit"".
