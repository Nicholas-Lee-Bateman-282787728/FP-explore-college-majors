1921367,5,B0000D8L4N,He is one of the funniest comedians around.  The show is hilarious and the DVD is a 2-disc set with a lot of features.  This edition will be good if you aren't able to find the show on TV anymore.,1243123200,2,196,3.875
1921368,5,B0000D8L4N,Dave continues to make u laugh from start to end. With amazing comments that are def great to use around ur friends and family.,1197158400,,127,4.333333333333333
1921369,3,B0000D8L4N,"great but i prefer my uncensored dvd's uncensored!!

while i loved both volume 1 and 2...i hate it when you advertise that the dvd is uncensored (it's even in the title!!) and then you go and censor it!! on the 2nd dvd it has deleted scenes ""uncensored"" and you censor a girl trying to show you how to easily get to her clit!! it should be called ""the best of insomniac with dave attell : volume 2"". saying it is uncensored is a bit misleading.",1159574400,9,444,4.223529411764706
1921370,5,B0000D8L4N,"Started watching last summer and instantly hooked.

For those who want to see what his show is about, buy/rent Vol 2, 10x as better than the Vol 1 set.",1105056000,,151,4.206896551724138
1921371,4,B0000D8L4N,"I felt compelled to get this one for two reasons:  1)Because I bought the first one and 2)because this one had the thing that I was kind of hoping the first one would have had...namely the Maine episode, in which Dave ends up at a leather bar, meets a lot of ""bears"" (look it up, I'm not explaining this one here), and witnesses live genital piercing!  Sadly, there wasn't really as much to the uncensored version as I had hoped (you see more male exposure in the Key West episode, also on this DVD), but still...
I like INSOMNIAC, because if you're going to wander around a major city at night, you might as well do it with a really funny guy who likes to drink...and Dave definitely fits that description.  Wonder if he's ever gonna do a Wichita episode?",1086393600,3,756,4.385714285714286
1921372,4,B0000D8L4N,"It's probably the sign of a character flaw, but if I channel surf onto Comedy Central's ""Insomniac,"" I'm stuck there, watching, till the show ends. I may have a downright snobby attitude toward `reality TV,' but I'm strangely almost always in the mood to watch an episode of ""Insomniac.""
 Part travelogue, part ""how things work"" program and part bar crawl, ""Insomniac"" follows the hard-drinking but ever-amiable comedian Dave Attell as he prowls various cities after dark. He hits nightclubs, factories, festivals, tourist spots - basically any place where people are doing stuff while the general populace is asleep.
 ""The Best of Insomniac Uncensored Volume Two"" compiles some of the series' best episodes, visits to ten cities including Anchorage, Boise, Key West, Miami and Austin, Tx. In some of the shows' better bits, Attell clubs around Amsterdam with a cheesy old buddy (who has apparently become a huge TV star in the Netherlands), tours a bustling Las Vegas pawn shop and catches up with his sister, who fronts a rock band in New York.
 The two-disk set presents the shows without the many bleeps and blurs that make the TV versions safe for mass consumption, and some of the episodes come with commentaries (with Attell and the show's producers) that reveal in humorous detail that the show is not nearly as easy to make as it seems.",1075161600,7,1345,4.942477876106195
1921373,5,B0000D8L4N,"Insomniac with Dave Attell Uncensored Volume 2, is by far a much improved disc collection.  Once again Dave takes us to ten cities and stays up all night 'til morning sun to show you what happens while most people are asleep.  Of course, he visits numerous crazy bars, some with male frontal nudity and many topless females too.  Dave also walks the streets to talk to some interesting or uninteresting people.  Some like to expose themselves to Dave or just for the camera.  Dave also visits a cemetery, a skating center with roller derby girls, a Mardi Gras parade in Key West, a tortilla making place, Alaska Solstice Celebration, shark fishing, sex playrooms, night time skiing, piercing, cow milking, fishing at Ship Creek, Isle of Capri Casino, underground coal mining, live sex show, cannabis & juice shop, legal prostitution and much more.  Cities include, Key West, Florida. Austin, Texas. Miami, Florida. Boise, Idaho. Anchorage, Alaska. Kansas City, Missouri. Charleston, West Virginia. Amsterdam, Netherlands. Las Vegas, Nevada. New York City, New York.  Episodes are from 2001-2003.  What was blurred out on television on the Comedy Central cable channel is all shown for all to see on this uncensored 2-disc set.
  Unfortunately, they did not make a Volume 3. I missed most of the Boston episode. I was sleeping.",1068422400,9,1326,5.0691244239631335

8000096,5,B0000D8L4N,"Several years ago I used to stay up late at night watching ""Insomniac with Dave Attell."" Eventually the series went off the air (or cable) and didn't get to see it again. After several years I got this DVD and now on occasion I like to play it and reminisce old times.",1374883200,,268,4.173076923076923
8000097,5,B0000D8L4N,"This was funny and interesting. Dave takes you along with him to see the different cities that he does stand-up in. I was surprised to see the kind of people in the different cities, makes me wanna travel. And that's what this series is like, travel and comedy mixed in one show.",1349827200,,279,4.384615384615385
8000098,4,B0000D8L4N,The Amazingly Hilarious comic Dave Attell's shortly lived Comedy Central travel show of city night lives was a unique show before it's time.,1349568000,,140,5.130434782608695
8000099,5,B0000D8L4N,1st off..I'm a huge fan so I have no complaints.  I wish they would bring insomniac back to Comedy Central because it was hilarious!,1320969600,2,132,4.5
8000100,3,B0000D8L4N,"Dave Attell is a down to the earth, or down to the drinks, and has comic relief with no holds barred.  This is definitely adult material only; I am pretty open minded and I can become shocked at some of his observations.

The style is stream of consciousness - his comedy drawn from experiences in bar hopping after hours until last call, speaking with different people - he is sharp witted and is an acquired taste. But no matter how much alcohol he ingests, he is still as sharp as a tack.

I like him because he makes me laugh and that is the purpose of comedy - however, if you see him on Comedy Central, it is more subdued and it is still wild.

The reason I give him a 3 star rating is that when he runs out of comedic material, he just rambles about his observations, and that is a little slow.  But when he is on a run I can't help but laughing out loud.

Just make sure you keep this hidden in your closet away from the teenagers - it is definitely adult humor and very graphic. But if I didn't like him I would not have purchased 3 of his CD, DVD's.

So if you like a sharp minded New York comedian, who will say anything that comes to mind, and will not screen any of his material for some raunchy material, then you will enjoy his ""shock comedian"" humor, that could make Howard Stern blush.",1318032000,,1302,4.142857142857143
8000101,5,B0000D8L4N,Dave Atell is a comedy genius and this hosting gig is right in his wheel house. He's a natural night owl with a love for the booze and can still wield his razor sharp wit at all he encounters when the sun goes down. Enjoy!,1302220800,2,222,3.9555555555555557
8000102,5,B0000D8L4N,"Although I would prefer new episodes of Insomniac, I will take this DVD for now. It has some great scenes and cameos from other comics. Also features audio commentary which is a fun side addition.",1295222400,,196,4.628571428571429
