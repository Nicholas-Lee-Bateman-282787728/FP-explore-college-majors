8016619,1,B0001US682,"This clumsily constructed work is essentially one long flashback narrated by Isma?l Marconi ( Alejandro Camacho), a Mexican Federal police official who describes, to two assassins deployed to kill him in his apartment, his fall from grace into corruption, the storyline largely concerning Marconi's tumultuous relationship with his second wife, Mabel (Adriana Fonseca), who functions as femme fatale to him and as mistress to a Presidential Candidate for whom Marconi is an advisor.  The film is directed as well as edited in awkward fashion, its glacial pace appropriate for the oft inexpert histrionics of some from the cast, especially an embarrassingly unskilled Fonseca, often risible with her efforts at expressing emotion, matters not being helped by a disconcerting hand-held video tape camera utilized in numerous sequences that feature a great deal of swooping, in addition to closeups that primarily indicate a keen requirement for scrubbing up the players, all while a turgid score meanders and the dirgelike title number is heard ad nauseum.  Shot in Mexico and in South Padre Island, Texas, the film is available upon a DVD of mediocre quality, with largely accurate English subtitles available, offering also six trailers for other Spanish language Mexican films, and brief interviews with several actors from the cast along with director Christian Gonz?lez, each plainly challenged to discover something meritable within what is, in reality, a less than engaging and simple-minded affair.",1146528000,,1504,5.5064935064935066
