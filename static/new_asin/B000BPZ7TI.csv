Instead, the information mostly revovles around the two instructors telling you how to live a more healthy lifestyle to support tmj health.  There is only one tiny segment of the entire dvd that shows actual manual techniques.  If you are looking for techniqus this dvd is not what you should buy.",1297209600,7,444,4.815789473684211
8209931,5,B000BPZ7TI,"I think this dvd is great.  I am a MT and this provides some extra specific massage work for Tmj to be used on yourself and others, plus other alternative treatments that may help. I think it was well put together and upbeat, does not bore you to death.  Great!  Just bought the one for Migraines too!  Can't wait to get it.",1225065600,,324,4.17741935483871
8209932,4,B000BPZ7TI,"I found the information very helpful. I'm applying some of their techniques and they are easing the pain. The video is not the best quality, especially the sound, but the presenters are genuine and easy to understand.",1212969600,2,217,4.891891891891892
8209933,5,B000BPZ7TI,"This DVD was done very professionally, and had alot of expert content.

I was surprised at how many methods could help those who suffer from TMJ.

The methods shown could also help with other conditions as well.

Thank goodness we can use these simple methods and not have to rely on pain pills. Great DVD.",1165449600,9,306,4.527272727272727
