8032681,3,B0002V7TWE,"I thought I was renting a formula-type Christmas movie, you know, the ones some people call ""cheesy"" and other find add to the joy of Christmastime.  Thus, I did not finish the movie, but appreciated the comments it might be good for a teen to watch--or if you are looking for a heavier story and can watch the subtitles.  I was not aware it would be subtitled, but I will be more aware in the future.  I am glad there are all kinds of movies, different strokes for different folks, just again, was slightly misled that it was pictured among other movies that are of the Hallmark variety as customers also liked. Thanks for listening.",1515196800,2,634,4.495652173913044

8032683,2,B0002V7TWE,These movies should have the words ENGLISH SUBTITLES in the synopsis. I'm very disappointed when I expect to listen to a movie instead of read a movie. Sometimes I need to be able to just listen because I am doing other things.,1514678400,2,227,4.428571428571429

8032687,2,B0002V7TWE,It was a foreign film with subtitles and was very slow moving.  Nothing worth watching so I turned it off before it finished.,1361923200,5,125,4.434782608695652
8032688,5,B0002V7TWE,I truly enjoyed this film. Keep me interested the entire time. Strong family values with a love that pulls through much turmoil,1361145600,,127,4.818181818181818
8032689,4,B0002V7TWE,"For execution, this movie is probably lower than average; it is somewhat choppy, much too dark most of the time, and somewhat confusing.  However, it deserves an ""A"" rating for raising ethical and religious issues that can be used to help form (teen's) character and values.  The foremost would be:  When is it one's Christian duty to help a criminal in need as opposed to turning him into the authorities?  Was Laura really falling in love with Freddy, or unconsciously rebelling against her dad?  When the pastor decided to call the police to turn Freddy in, what were his real motives for doing it?  I did find it interesting that when the pastor prayed, much like many of the Psalms, he found the strength to do what he needed to do.  This is a good movie for families concerned with traditional values to show to their teens and then discuss the various issues.",1142208000,13,866,4.620915032679738
