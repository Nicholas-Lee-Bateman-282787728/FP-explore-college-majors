8124710,4,B000FMJJTG,"Over the years I have watched and listened to a lot of the Gaither Homecoming series. Joy to the World  has become a Christmas tradition at our house.

The selections on this program include some favorite Christmas Classic Carols as well as some more contemporary numbers. Interesting testimonies are interspersed between some of the musical numbers which add another dimension to the presentation.

My favorite numbers include those backed up by the Christ Church Choir of with Janet Pascal, and Mark Lowrys Mary Did You Know?

Memorable  inspiring  great family entertainment !
