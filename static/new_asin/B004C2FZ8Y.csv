8422681,3,B004C2FZ8Y,"This is what I liked about this dvd -

The interviews of the folks at the festival and the footage of the setting up for the concert. This gave a sense of time and place to it. Through it I experienced something of what it was to be there. Also what it was to be in England a place that lives in my memory in music , primarily music of this same generation that inhabits this dvd. The off-handed nature of this whole effort is at it's peak here.

The Jerry Garcia interview. Just seeing Jerry have a conversation with the interviewer gives  a glimpse into one of the iconic figures of R n R. Add in that the music of this day was THE Music of the Ages for some of us, and this fellow was one of that music's prime movers ( especially during this particular time) and it makes listening in more poignant.

That pretty much does it for the really enjoyable aspects of this dvd. The concerts are delivered in bootleg form of various mostly the poor variety of audio that while apparently being from the festival itself only make a mark in that the viewer gets some sense of what it was like to hear the band live. Bands like Family and Captain Beefheart fare better than others in this format. Grateful Dead are acceptable as well to ears that are already well versed in sitting thru hours of bootleg recordings of quality that ranges all over the place.

The video portion though is not good . Here the viewer gets everything from concert footage loops showing the same 8 seconds of tape spliced end to end, over and over , interspersed with pictures ( pictures from this festival? Who knows?) of the artist in concert. At least that is what you get in the live Captain Beefheart part here. Other sections offer non lip-synced footage from literally all over the place which delivers a mish mash of viewpoints with the only connective tissue being the bootlegged audio. Obviously no one had a scheme coming in to deliver anything like an actual production of a documentary. While that is not all bad what it does deliver takes some work to appreciate.

Overall I liked the trip down Memory Lane feel of this. The film enhanced my memories of that time in some good ways. I was prepared to be blown away by this whole 4 hour epic came away in the end let down. High expectations lend themselves to a let down. That's a given a lot of times. In the end I have to ask myself when I will take the time to sit thru the 4 hours here.. For now I can't imagine when that will be.",1373155200,2,2469,4.310344827586207
