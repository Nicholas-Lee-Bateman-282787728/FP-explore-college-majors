5050019,3,B0072GOJ48,"I bought this product for me and my children to enjoy together. We have bought all the smaller collections as they came out. ""Shear Madness"" is the most recent one and it contained TWO episodes that have already come out in former collections! Disappointing. :(

OLD EPISODE ONE- Party Animals

OLD EPISODE TWO- Draw the Line",1339632000,3,325,4.785714285714286
5050020,1,B0072GOJ48,"You can put lipstick on a pig but ...
Maybe Shaun has discovered time warp - Baaaa!
Are my brain cells really disappearing that quickly, but haven't I seen a few of these stories on previous DVDs?
Or, am I really confusing my dream state with reality? Which am I in? Help!",1337385600,,272,4.25
5050021,5,B0072GOJ48,The DVD arrived in great condition...my grandkids love shawn the sheep DVDs and were excited to see a brand new movie,1336608000,,117,4.619047619047619
5050022,3,B0072GOJ48,"I preorder my DVD's and so there is not a chance to read any reviews.  What a shame, because if I had known there were going to be 2 duplicates, I might not have bought it.  The new episodes were fantastic as usual, but when I realized ""Hey, haven't we seen these before?"" I was appalled. How could they get away with putting duplicates in the DVD and calling it new?  I will NEVER preorder again.  I will wait and see reviews to see if they are going to scam us again.  Very disappointing, very disappointing!",1335830400,4,510,4.270833333333333
5050023,5,B0072GOJ48,"While this is a great compilation of Shaun episodes, all of these episodes are on the Season 2 Shaun the Sheep DVD pack.
So don't purchase this DVD if you already have Season 2.  Otherwise, it's fun as usual!",1335744000,8,208,4.333333333333333
5050024,4,B0072GOJ48,"Shaun the Sheep is a classic for my family and it is a show that we all can watch together.  This new DVD is 45 minutes long with seven episodes full of Shaun the Sheep mischief!  We have seen some of the other episodes before but my boys (3 and 5) didn't mind.  What I like about Shaun the Sheep is that the characters don't talk, but rather make noises and use their actions.  It is a nice break from traditional animation.  There are even some lessons to be learned for kids and laughs for adults!",1335052800,,500,4.166666666666667
5050025,1,B0072GOJ48,"Don't get me wrong, the new episodes on this DVD are as good as any - but they put on a few from previous DVD's . . . but charge the same price?  A+ for the new material.  F for making the customer pay for things they already own.",1334707200,10,230,3.673469387755102
5050026,2,B0072GOJ48,"As usual Shaun and the gang keep us amused and entertained, but we were a bit disappointed that two of these episodes (""Party Animals"" and ""Draw the Line"") appeared on previous DVDs, leaving only a scant five previously unreleased episodes (Provided you didn't purchase the Season Two boxed set--then there's nothing new!) Hope this doesn't mean that the folks at HiT entertainment have resorted to ""padding"" DVDs with previously released materials to milk more money out of its customers.",1334620800,24,489,5.2025316455696204

""Shawn The Sheep: Shear Madness""
(Hit Entertainment, 2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Another great installment of this animated British kid's TV show -- a spinoff of the famous ""Wallace And Gromit"" claymation series.  This DVD includes several new episodes, including a great sci-fi story with the goofy UFO aliens that have become regulars on the show, a couple with the farmyard pigs getting their comeuppance, and a wild house party where the farmer has a little too much fun.  The show shows remarkable durability - the jokes are still funny and the timing is still great. Recommended for viewers young and old! If you like Shawn already, you'll enjoy this collection as well.

5050037,5,B0072GOJ48,"Okay, I'm a grumpy old fart, but I love Wallace and Gromit adventures. I came across Shaun the Sheep videos, and now I can't get enough. The stories are quite cute. Unlike Wallace & Gromit, or Chicken Run made by the same group, Shaun and friends don't speak. It will appeal to all age groups. It is so nice to find entertainment that is simple and fun; no bad language, no excessive violence, just plain fun.

Just the thing to keep grumpy old grandpas happy.",1430006400,,460,4.411764705882353

5050059,5,B0072GOJ48,I ordered six of these dvd's to pass out to family members.  Everyone just loves it - young and old.  It is incredible to capture such humor with so little dialog.  The scenes are incredibly clever and you can re-watch several times and still see new things in each scene that you missed previously.  My six year old and our sixty-six year old laugh out loud when watching.  How many shows can you say nowadays actually bring a family together for fun and joy?,1391644800,,460,4.428571428571429
