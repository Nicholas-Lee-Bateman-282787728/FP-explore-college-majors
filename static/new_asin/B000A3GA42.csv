8074091,1,B000A3GA42,"Bought this VHS several years ago at Best Buy, and while the VHS itself is still in great shape and runs smoothly, the cartoons leave everything to be desired.

The video starts off with a squealing test pattern, so it's best not to try and watch this with any form of surround sound. There are no extras in the back of the tape, just black film and then static.

The worst short on here is the Steadfast Tin Soldier ~ which was already a color cartoon from Ub Iwerks. This tape re-colorizes it, chopping out most of the fluid animation scenes, and re-dubbed the entire cartoon, taking out the music score. This is just the first cartoon on the tape, so maybe it's good that the worst is over with fast.

Music and Charm (originally The Villain Still Pursued Her) is a hard to find Terrytoon, that was rendered completely destroyed in this release. All of the sound is gone, having been re-dubbed as an instrumental piece, complete with a clown whistle and bad 1970's music. The box even touts it as having originally been a silent cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Bosko's name is misspelled on the box as ""Bosco"" and his Woodland Daze cartoon is just a hot mess on this tape. Poorly re-colored, partially re-dubbed, quite offensive considering when this tape came out. Bosko originally was a Black caricature, but this 1985 print drives it home. Totally awful.

Toy Shop begins with barely an intro card, so unless you have the VHS box, you may never know what exactly you are looking at. Originally this was the cheerful and funny Looney Tunes short ""We're in the Money"" but this version tones down the gags and was colorized the worst of the four. The money is colored as being regular discs, removing the gag ""We are the money"" and making it feel pretty lame.

Cartoon List:
1. The Steadfast Tin Soldier
2. Music and Charm
3. Bosko/Bosco's Woodland Daze
4. Toy Shop

If you are a fan or collector of bad re-colors, the tape is in great shape, but if you don't feel like being angry at the decimation of classic cartoon history, then please do your best to avoid purchasing this title.",1360022400,,2106,4.555555555555555
