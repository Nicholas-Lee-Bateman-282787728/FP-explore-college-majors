8096972,5,B000CCCZZO,I watched Hammy as a young kid growing up and still watch him whenever I am lucky enough to find a channel broadcasting it.  A great show for kids of all ages!,1180742400,,159,3.96875
8096973,4,B000CCCZZO,"Sorry but once I read the other review I had to put in my 2 cents.. First off hammy & friends are done with live aminamls  very tastfully. It has nice safe storys that any child 2 to 5 will love. They are not out to make any statement or to teach any truths. However you can set the kid in frount of the tv and not worry about a thing. You can go do the laundry and vac without a care in the world. Your child is not in any danger of any negative imput here..  I first saw Hammy on  ""The Animal chanle"" at 5:00 am.  I soon put it on VHS for the kids in the AM before School or daycare. I did not have to worry about what they were watching. No explenations of why we have bombed a Country or any other subject I just feel they do not have to worry about this young.  Now this is comming from a 41 year old woman who loves Adult swim on Sunday night. ( Family Guy ) ( robot chiken) and all the adult crap that intails. One of the kid  shows I hate is ""Higgly Town Hero's"". My reason: The statment, "" if you work hard like I do you can be a hero just like me.."" Well I do not want my child to learn the only value he or she has is through work.  I do love the Koala Brothers. Why because the emphasis is on helping people. What a great place the world would be if everyone just helped each other. Not working for your identity. America is full of over worked unhappy people, why raise the next generation with our problems. Europe has it RIGHT work what you need and LIVE DEEPLY. There is more to life than Work. Most people in America HATE there jobs. They work for money not happyness. I believe there is enough brain washing going on every day throught the T.V. and we do not even realize it is going on. it is so well coverd in the entertaiment. No, I do not care if Hammy is not makeing any point and is a little happy story my kids will learn nothing from. As long as they get  enjoyment form the storys.  Watch it for yourself do not let others tell you what you should do. Rember this is for Children age 2 to 5 but my 7 year old loves it too...",1142294400,,2051,3.8992805755395685
8096974,1,B000CCCZZO,"This was utter and total crap.  Don't waste your money on this.  No one should care about Hammy or his ""jolly"" adventures.  They are beyond lame and no one should be forced to endure the painful retardation of this film.

THE END.",1140825600,,230,4.404761904761905
